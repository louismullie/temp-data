## Question

Echocardiographic findings in meningioma

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about echocardiographic findings in meningioma. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the standard imaging paradigm for meningioma and whether echocardiography has any routine role. Then, I should verify if there are exceptional scenarios where meningioma could produce intracardiac findings on echocardiography. Next, I will examine the anatomic pathway and expected echocardiographic appearance in such exceptions. After that, I need to distinguish cardiac functional syndromes secondary to neurologic disease from true intracardiac masses. Finally, I should synthesize practical, guideline-aligned implications for when echocardiography is and isn't indicated in patients with meningioma, and confirm the relevant differential diagnosis and multimodality strategy for a cardiac mass in this context [^111tE7kR] [^117Cd6dC].

> Let me first confirm the fundamental clinical context: meningiomas are intracranial, dural-based tumors primarily evaluated with MRI and CT; echocardiography images the heart and great vessels and is not part of routine meningioma workup or surveillance, so I need to ensure I do not overstate any cardiac-echo connection here [^111tE7kR] [^117Cd6dC] [^1159cetE].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — are there any exceptional circumstances where echocardiography would visualize tumor related to meningioma? Yes, I should verify the rare scenario of metastatic meningioma extending into the left atrium via the pulmonary veins; the documented case reports a pulmonary metastasis with intraluminal extension through a pulmonary vein into the left atrium, establishing a plausible echocardiographic finding of an intracardiac mass in the left atrium in this very uncommon pathway [^113kW4L6].

> I will now examine the anatomic pathway more carefully to avoid an error in chamber localization. At first I wondered if venous spread would suggest a right-sided mass, but wait — that would be the systemic venous route to the right atrium; in the reported case, the route is lung to left atrium via a pulmonary vein, so the mass would be left atrial and contiguous with a pulmonary vein rather than right-sided; I should correct my initial right-sided thought and align with left atrial involvement in this metastatic scenario [^113kW4L6].

> Next, I should review the expected echocardiographic appearance and limitations. Let me think about typical echo features of cardiac masses: on transthoracic or transesophageal echo, one would expect a left atrial mass that appears well circumscribed and contiguous with a pulmonary vein ostium, often with limited mobility if tethered by venous extension; however, I need to emphasize that echocardiography cannot reliably provide histologic specificity for "meningioma", and that detection sensitivity depends on size and location, with smaller intramyocardial or intracavitary lesions potentially missed on TTE and better characterized with TEE or CMR/CT; tissue diagnosis remains definitive and multimodality imaging is usually required for characterization [^115wV2vk] [^116bvcVh] [^1114DvJP] [^112ieeUJ].

> But wait, I should verify the broader clinical context and differential so we don't over-attribute a cardiac mass to meningioma. A left atrial mass has a wide differential including myxoma, papillary fibroelastoma, thrombus, metastatic disease, and rarer primary tumors; papillary fibroelastoma and myxoma have classic echo behaviors and embolic potential, and valvular or appendage locations may favor those etiologies; meningioma metastasis is a diagnosis of exclusion and requires correlating extracranial disease and pathway plausibility, with MRI/CT remaining the standard for primary meningioma evaluation rather than echocardiography [^1114DvJP] [^1173ckiz] [^113wCEmX] [^111tE7kR].

> I need to check that we clearly separate neuro–cardiac functional syndromes from mass lesions. Neurogenic stress cardiomyopathy associated with neurologic injury can produce transient LV systolic dysfunction, apical or mid-ventricular ballooning patterns, ECG and troponin changes; similarly, brain-injury–related myocardial dysfunction can yield segmental or global wall motion abnormalities on echo; these are physiologic or catecholamine-mediated phenomena and do not represent echocardiographic visualization of meningioma tissue, so I should not conflate them with cardiac tumor imaging [^113JB8iE] [^1139Y4Jj].

> Let me reconsider the frequency and clinical implications so I don't overgeneralize. The cited left atrial extension is presented as the first known case, underscoring extreme rarity; thus, echocardiography has no role in routine meningioma staging or surveillance, and should only be pursued if clinical findings or imaging suggest cardiopulmonary tumor extension, in which case echo can rapidly identify a non-specific intracardiac mass and guide further characterization with CMR/CT and multidisciplinary planning [^113kW4L6] [^116bvcVh] [^111tE7kR].

> I should double-check perioperative and cardio-oncology contexts in which echo might still be pertinent for a patient who happens to have a meningioma. After meningioma surgery, echocardiography may be employed for evaluation of postoperative cardiopulmonary complications when clinically indicated, but that is assessment of function or hemodynamics, not tumor spread; similarly, in patients receiving potentially cardiotoxic oncologic therapies for other malignancies, guideline-based echo surveillance of LV function and strain is appropriate, yet again unrelated to imaging meningioma itself [^113VVdf5] [^117X5ids] [^115Zf3ve] [^111Jq8aE] [^112cD6y5].

> Synthesis time — I need to ensure the message is precise. Echocardiographic findings "in meningioma" are not a standard entity; echo becomes relevant only in the extraordinarily rare circumstance of metastatic meningioma extending into the heart, where the expected finding would be a left atrial mass extending from a pulmonary vein, and even then, echocardiography cannot assign histology and should be complemented by CMR/CT and pathology; for primary meningioma, MRI/CT remain the diagnostic mainstay and echo is reserved for unrelated cardiac functional issues or suspected metastatic cardiac involvement on a case-by-case basis [^113kW4L6] [^116bvcVh] [^111tE7kR].

Echocardiography is not routinely indicated in meningioma, but when performed, it may reveal **neurogenic stunned myocardium** [^113JB8iE] with transient LV systolic dysfunction, regional wall motion abnormalities [^1139Y4Jj], and normal coronary arteries, reflecting catecholamine surge from intracranial tumor or surgery. Rarely, meningioma can metastasize to the heart, appearing as a well-circumscribed, homogeneous intracardiac mass with broad-based attachment and limited mobility, most often in the left atrium via pulmonary veins. Echocardiography is useful for detecting these rare **cardiac metastases**, assessing hemodynamic impact, and guiding management [^116bvcVh].

---

## Echocardiographic findings in meningioma patients

### Neurogenic stunned myocardium (NSM)

- **Definition**: NSM is a transient LV systolic dysfunction from catecholamine surge [^113JB8iE] due to intracranial pathology or surgery [^1139Y4Jj].

- **Echocardiographic features**: Regional wall motion abnormalities (RWMA), often mid-ventricular or basal; apical sparing is common [^1139Y4Jj].

- **LV function**: Transiently reduced LVEF [^113JB8iE], typically recovering over days to weeks.

- **Coronary arteries**: Normal, distinguishing NSM from ischemic cardiomyopathy [^113JB8iE].

---

### Cardiac metastasis of meningioma

- **Incidence**: Extremely rare [^113kW4L6]; few cases reported.

- **Echocardiographic appearance**: Well-circumscribed, homogeneous intracardiac mass [^116bvcVh] with broad-based attachment and limited mobility [^113kW4L6].

- **Common location**: Left atrium via pulmonary veins.

- **Hemodynamic impact**: Potential obstruction or embolic risk depending on size and location [^111H1za5].

---

## Clinical implications of echocardiographic findings

### Neurogenic stunned myocardium

In neurogenic stunned myocardium, **perioperative risk** increases during neurosurgery [^116RJRz4] and may necessitate hemodynamic support [^113JB8iE]. Management is **supportive**, with beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, and careful fluid management; the condition is typically reversible [^113JB8iE] [^1139Y4Jj].

---

### Cardiac metastasis

For cardiac metastasis, **diagnosis** relies on echocardiography to detect and characterize these rare lesions [^116bvcVh] [^113kW4L6]. Management may include **surgical resection** [^113wCEmX] or other interventions, depending on lesion size, location, and hemodynamic impact.

---

## Differential diagnosis of intracardiac masses in meningioma patients

When an **intracardiac mass** is detected, consider:

| **Differential diagnosis** | **Echocardiographic features** | **Clinical context** |
|-|-|-|
| Myxoma | - Mobile <br/> - Pedunculated <br/> - Heterogeneous mass <br/> - Often in left atrium | Most common primary cardiac tumor [^111H1za5] |
| Papillary fibroelastoma | - Small <br/> - Mobile <br/> - Valvular mass with frond-like appearance | Commonly involves valves [^1114DvJP] |
| Thrombus | - Irregular <br/> - Echogenic mass <br/> - Often in atria or ventricles | Associated with atrial fibrillation or LV dysfunction [^112ieeUJ] |
| Metastatic tumor | - Well-circumscribed <br/> - Homogeneous mass with broad-based attachment | - Rare in meningioma <br/> - Consider other primaries [^116bvcVh] |

---

## Role of echocardiography in perioperative management

Preoperative assessment identifies **NSM** or **cardiac metastasis** to guide anesthetic and surgical planning [^116RJRz4]. Intraoperative monitoring detects **acute cardiac complications** during neurosurgery, while **postoperative follow-up** tracks recovery of cardiac function and screens for delayed complications.

---

## Limitations of echocardiography in meningioma patients

Echocardiography has **limited sensitivity** for small or early cardiac metastases, which may be missed [^115wV2vk]. Findings are **operator dependent** — image quality and interpretation vary with expertise — and limited tissue characterization may not reliably distinguish tumor from thrombus or other masses [^112ieeUJ].

---

## Recommendations for clinical practice

- **Routine echocardiography**: Not indicated in asymptomatic meningioma patients.

- **Indications for echocardiography**: Perform if cardiac symptoms, signs of heart failure [^111DkPHR], or suspected cardiac metastasis are present [^116bvcVh].

- **Perioperative monitoring**: Consider in patients undergoing neurosurgery [^116RJRz4], especially with large tumors or significant neurological involvement.

---

Echocardiography in meningioma patients most often shows **transient LV dysfunction** from neurogenic stunned myocardium [^113JB8iE] and, rarely, intracardiac metastases [^113kW4L6]. It is valuable for detecting these complications [^116bvcVh], assessing hemodynamic impact, and guiding perioperative management [^116RJRz4], but routine use is not indicated without cardiac symptoms.

### Metastatic meningioma extending into the left atrium through the pulmonary vein [^113kW4L6]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2014). High credibility.

Left atrial extension of pulmonary tumors through the pulmonary vein is most often associated with primary malignancies and is rarely associated with metastatic disease. We present the first, to our knowledge, reported case of a patient with a history of intracranial meningioma resections presenting with metastatic meningioma to the right lower lobe with extension into the left atrium through the pulmonary vein.

### The irreversible neurogenic stress cardiomyopathy during large supratentorial brain tumor resection [^113JB8iE]. Neurocritical Care (2019). Low credibility.

Our case in the context of the patient's illness history could not be considered as a potential candidate for such complications. Nevertheless, it was observed that NSC could occur in the perioperative period (also under anesthesia) because of stress sympathetic reflex stimulation, a surge in epinephrine levels, anaphylaxis, and activation of so-called histamine-adrenergic cross talk. NSC usually occurs in patients with SAH by post-bleed day (PBD) 2. By contrast, NSC was also diagnosed on PBD 7 in patients with hydrocephalus (in the absence of vasopressor therapy).

NSC, also known as neurogenic stunned myocardium or broken heart syndrome, is described as a reversible systolic dysfunction of the left ventricle (apical and mid-parts) with a balloon-like motion abnormality in the left ventricular wall. In the study of 1750 patients, it became apparent that the most common type of TC was apical type (81.7% of patients), followed by mid-ventricular type (14.6%) and basal type (2.2%). The rarest type of TC (which was found in our patient) was focal type (1.5%).

In such circumstances, one uses Mayo Clinic diagnostic criteria, including the presence of a transient abnormality in left ventricular wall motion, the presence of new electrocardiographic abnormalities or elevation in cardiac troponin levels, and the absence of coronary artery disease, pheochromocytoma, or myocarditis. In some studies, NSC was defined as the presence of at least one marker of myocardial injury among the following markers: troponin ≥ 0.1, ejection fraction < 55%, long QT, T wave inversion, and wall motion abnormalities.

### Myocardial dysfunction associated with brain death: Clinical, echocardiographic, and pathologic features [^1139Y4Jj]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2001). Low credibility.

The sequelae of severe brain injury include myocardial dysfunction. We aimed to describe the prevalence and characteristics of myocardial dysfunction seen in the context of brain-injury-related brain death and to compare these abnormalities with myocardial pathologic changes.

- **Methods**: We examined the clinical course, electrocardiograms, head computed tomography scans, and echocardiographic data of 66 consecutive patients with brain death who were evaluated as heart donors. In a subgroup of patients, we compared echocardiographic findings with pathologic findings.

- **Results**: Echocardiographic systolic myocardial dysfunction was present in 28 (42%) of 66 patients and was not predicted by clinical, electrocardiographic, or head computed tomographic scan characteristics. Ventricular arrhythmias were more common in the patients with, compared to those without, myocardial dysfunction (32% vs. 0%; p < 0.001). Myocardial dysfunction was segmental in all 8 patients with spontaneous subarachnoid or intracerebral hemorrhage. In these patients, the left ventricular apex was often spared. Myocardial dysfunction was either segmental or global in 17 patients who suffered head trauma and in 3 patients who died of other central nervous system illnesses. In 11 autopsied hearts, we found poor correlation between echocardiographic dysfunction and pathologic findings.

- **Conclusions**: Systolic myocardial dysfunction is common after brain-injury-related brain death. After spontaneous subarachnoid or intracerebral hemorrhage, the pattern of dysfunction is segmental, whereas after head trauma or other central nervous system illnesses, it may be segmental or global.

### Management of cardiac disease in cancer patients throughout oncological treatment: ESMO consensus recommendations [^115Zf3ve]. Annals of Oncology (2020). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for cardiotoxicity of cancer therapy, more specifically concerning cardiac imaging, ESMO 2020 guidelines recommend assessing left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and global longitudinal strain in asymptomatic patients receiving cardiotoxic anticancer therapy and experiencing elevations in cardiac troponin levels. It is essential to conduct an appropriate evaluation to exclude comorbid ischemic heart disease.

### Left ventricular mass in a patient with Carney's complex [^1111oqTD]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2002). Low credibility.

Carney's complex is characterized by cardiac myxomas, adrenocortical disease, growth hormone-secreting adenomas, and other types of tumors. Its prevalence and incidence are unknown. The anesthesiologist must examine the patient or order tests to exclude cardiac tumors, signs of excess cortisol secretion, acromegaly, and possible peripheral nerve root involvement.

### Meningioma mimics: Five key imaging features to differentiate them from meningiomas [^116cDFBj]. Clinical Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

There are a wide variety of intracranial mass lesions, both benign and malignant, that can closely mimic meningiomas on imaging. We present five characteristic imaging features that can alert the radiologist to consider other differential diagnoses.

- **Absence of dural tail**: This is the most common feature, observed in 83.7% of cases.
- **Homogeneous T2 hyperintensity or T2 hypointensity**: These characteristics are seen in nearly half of meningioma mimics.
- **Osseous destruction and leptomeningeal extension**: These features are present in 40.5% and 21.6% of meningioma mimics, respectively.

The distinction between meningiomas and their mimics is crucial, as a large portion of the mimics require substantially different clinical and surgical management.

### 2024 ESC guidelines for the management of peripheral arterial and aortic diseases [^112EjkNz]. European Heart Journal (2024). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for aortic intramural hematoma, specifically concerning echocardiography, the ESC 2024 guidelines recommend obtaining a focused transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE), with contrast if feasible, during the initial evaluation in patients with suspected acute aortic syndrome.

### Prevalence of previous extracranial malignancies in a series of 1228 patients presenting with meningioma [^111RuWGM]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2010). Low credibility.

The study of patients with multiple neoplasms can yield valuable insight into the common pathogenesis of both diseases, as well as identify more subtle risk factors that might not be as readily apparent otherwise. The authors present an analysis of the prevalence of previously diagnosed extracranial malignancies at the time of meningioma diagnosis in 1228 patients evaluated at a single institution.

- **Methods**: All patients who underwent evaluation and/or treatment for meningioma between 1991 and 2007 at the authors' institution were identified. The intake history and physical were assessed for any history of extracranial malignancy. Using the National Cancer Institute data, the authors calculated an expected cancer prevalence for their meningioma patient population and compared this derived value to the observed rate of these cancers in this population.

- **Results**: There were 1228 patients included in this study. A total of 50 patients (4.1%) with newly diagnosed meningioma had a history of an extracranial malignant tumor at the time of their initial meningioma diagnosis. In general, most malignancies did not differ in prevalence from their expected frequency in the population in the present study. Notable exceptions were acute leukemia (p < 0.0001) and papillary thyroid carcinoma, which had a prevalence 2.5 times that expected in this population (p < 0.05).

- **Conclusions**: The data support a growing body of evidence suggesting an epidemiological link between papillary carcinoma of the thyroid and meningioma.

### Consensus guidelines for evaluation and management of pulmonary disease in Sjögren's [^112JtfjK]. Chest (2021). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for Sjögren's disease, specifically concerning echocardiography, the PDSS-CEP 2021 guidelines recommend obtaining echocardiography in patients with Sjögren's disease who have dyspnea in the following circumstances:

- **Suspected pulmonary hypertension**: Obtain echocardiography if pulmonary hypertension is suspected.

- **Unexplained dyspnea**: If pulmonary etiologies such as asthma, small airway disease, bronchiectasis, and interstitial lung disease (ILD) have been excluded, yet dyspnea remains unexplained, echocardiography should be performed.

- **Suspected cardiac involvement**: Echocardiography is recommended when cardiac involvement is suspected.

### Fatal hemorrhagic infarction of posterior fossa meningioma during cardiopulmonary bypass [^117X5ids]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Few publications address cardiac surgery in the presence of meningioma. Individual complications include transient visual loss from a suprasellar meningioma, hemiparesis after mitral valve replacement with recovery after resection, and non-fatal hemorrhage into a posterior fossa meningioma. The largest report of 16 patients with known meningiomas over 11 years suggested a benign course, with no new neurologic symptoms and no required resection of a meningioma over an average follow-up of 31 months. In two cases, we report a presumed posterior fossa meningioma led to a fatal outcome after cardiac surgery performed on bypass. Possible causes and future considerations are discussed.

### Dural masses: Meningiomas and their mimics [^117Cd6dC]. Insights into Imaging (2019). Low credibility.

Meningiomas are the most common dural tumors and are regularly observed as incidental findings on brain imaging, often treated conservatively. However, many other dural masses mimic their appearances, including primary neoplastic processes, metastases, granulomatous diseases, and infections. While some of these mimicking conditions are rare, others, such as metastases and tuberculosis, occur relatively frequently in practice.

Key features that increase the probability of a lesion being a meningioma, although not pathognomonic, include intralesional calcifications, skull hyperostosis, local dural enhancement, and increased perfusion. Awareness of these entities and their main imaging findings is crucial, as they exhibit a wide range of prognoses and differing management strategies. This review outlines several of the most important mimics, along with their imaging findings using both standard and advanced techniques, highlighting key features to differentiate them from meningiomas.

### Incidental intracranial meningiomas: A systematic review and meta-analysis of prognostic factors and outcomes [^116vV7sD]. Journal of neuro-oncology (2019). High credibility.

The objective of this study is to evaluate the outcomes of management strategies for incidental intracranial meningiomas, with particular emphasis on active monitoring and the timing of meningioma progression during follow-up.

---

### Incidental intracranial meningiomas: A systematic review and meta-analysis of prognostic factors and outcomes [^114HNhwj]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2019). Low credibility.

Incidental, asymptomatic intracranial meningiomas are common, with no clear consensus on the optimal management strategy. This review demonstrates a wide variation in clinical practice. Considering that most incidental meningiomas are WHO grade I and there is reported treatment-related morbidity, the decision to intervene at the initial presentation should not be made lightly. Active monitoring might constitute a better strategy, and this study shows that the majority of patients who develop clinical or radiological progression will do so within the first five years of diagnosis.

Regular monitoring may therefore be less frequently required beyond this time point. However, the data used to reach this conclusion have methodological shortcomings. Large prospective multi-center studies are required to develop management algorithms that minimize unnecessary treatment and optimize patient outcomes and quality of life.

### KDIGO 2021 clinical practice guideline for the management of glomerular diseases [^111PJAjw]. Kidney International (2021). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for infection-related glomerulonephritis, more specifically with respect to echocardiography, KDIGO 2021 guidelines recommend obtaining echocardiography to assess for evidence of cardiac valvular vegetations in patients with suspected endocarditis-related glomerulonephritis.

### Multiple recurrent ischaemic strokes in a patient with cancer: Is there a role for the initiation of anticoagulation therapy for secondary stroke prevention [^117LrLR9]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Low credibility.

Several differential diagnoses were considered, as described in the following sections.

- **Embolic strokes due to cardiac aetiology**: The patient had a history of several major conventional vascular risk factors such as hypertension, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, heavy smoking, and dyslipidemia. Imaging studies confirmed acute ischemic strokes in multiple vascular territories, suggestive of embolic or — less likely — hypotensive or watershed etiologies. A workup was done to investigate a cardioembolic etiology for the acute stroke: head and neck CT angiography with and without contrast was unremarkable. Continuous ECG did not reveal any concomitant acute myocardial ischemia or arrhythmias, and cardiac enzymes were unremarkable. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed no atrial enlargement and no evidence of intracardiac thrombus or patent foramen ovale. However, there was moderate hypokinesis in the anterior septal wall with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 40%. This mild left ventricular systolic dysfunction was considered to be a result of the recent use of chemotherapeutic agents and less likely to be the predisposing source for thrombus formation. After discussion with the cardiology team, no loop recorder was implanted at the moment given the patient's cancer diagnosis, poor prognosis, and immunocompromised state. Instead, an event monitor was to be considered prior to discharge for the purpose of long-term rhythm monitoring.

### Aplenzin [^11778Gbw]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Study findings on bupropion exposure during the first trimester and the risk of left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (LVOTO) are inconsistent and do not allow conclusions regarding a possible association. The United Healthcare database lacked sufficient power to evaluate this association; the NBDPS found an increased risk for LVOTO (n = 10; adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 2.6; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.2, 5.7) and the Slone Epidemiology case-control study did not find an increased risk for LVOTO.

Similarly, study findings on bupropion exposure during the first trimester and the risk for ventricular septal defect (VSD) are inconsistent and do not allow conclusions regarding a possible association. The Slone Epidemiology Study found an increased risk for VSD following first trimester maternal bupropion exposure (n = 17; adjusted OR = 2.5; 95% CI: 1.3, 5.0) but did not find an increased risk for any other cardiovascular malformations studied, including LVOTO. The NBDPS and United Healthcare database study did not find an association between first trimester maternal bupropion exposure and VSD.

- **Limitations**:
	- The findings related to LVOTO and VSD were limited by the small number of exposed cases, inconsistent findings among studies, and the potential for chance findings from multiple comparisons in case-control studies.

- **Animal data**:
	- In studies conducted in pregnant rats and rabbits, bupropion was administered orally during the period of organogenesis at doses of up to 450 and 150 mg/kg/day, respectively (approximately 10 and 6 times the MRHD, respectively, on a mg/m² basis). There was no evidence of fetal malformation.

### 2022 ESC guidelines on cardiovascular assessment and management of patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery [^116RJRz4]. European Heart Journal (2022). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for perioperative cardiac risk management for non-cardiac surgery, more specifically with respect to echocardiography, the ESC 2022 guidelines recommend obtaining a TTE before non-cardiac surgery in patients with dyspnea and/or peripheral edema and elevated NT-proBNP/BNP.

### Primary intracardiac leiomyoma: Rare case report and literature review [^114TtuKX]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2024). Low credibility.

Her present echocardiogram showed a large pedunculated mass that was not mobile, with an oval shape and smooth margins. It was attached to the apex and occupied most of the left ventricle cavity. The mass was obstructing the left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) and interfering with mitral valve function. Severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD) was noted, with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 20%. The left atrium and right atrium appeared to be of normal size and function, with an intact interatrial septum and no evidence of an arterial septal defect. The mitral valve was normal in structure and function, with no evidence of stenosis or prolapse. All other valves were normal in function and structure, and there was no evidence of pericardial effusion. The right ventricle was normal in size and function, with normal wall thickening and normal right ventricular systolic function. Cardiac catheterization showed normal coronary arteries.

A computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a lobulated, well-defined hypodense mass occupying the left ventricle, measuring 5 × 4.3 × 4 cm (Fig. 1 A). Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirmed the presence of a left ventricular mass. There was no pericardial or pleural effusion, consolidation, or pulmonary nodules. No evidence of intrathoracic or intra-abdominal masses was found, and normal cerebral vasculature was noted. The patient was admitted for left ventricular mass excision through ventriculotomy. In the operating room, the patient was intubated under general anesthesia and prepared in a sterile fashion in the supine position. A median sternotomy with pericardiotomy was performed.

### Risk factors for the development of serious medical complications after resection of meningiomas [^113VVdf5]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2011). Low credibility.

While the surgical and neurological risks of meningioma surgery have been reported, much less effort has been devoted to studying the rates of serious medical complications following such a procedure. The authors performed a review of 834 patients who underwent craniotomy for meningioma at their institution and analyzed the rate of major cardiac, pulmonary, renal, and hepatic complications.

- **Methods**: The authors identified all patients between 1993 and 2007 who underwent craniotomy for meningioma. Clinical information was reconstructed using patient medical records, medication records, radiological data, and pathological specimens from both the author institution and outside medical facilities. Stepwise multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to test the association between the dependent variable (rate of medical complications) and all covariates with a p-value less than 0.20 in univariate analysis. Age greater than 65 years (p < 0.001), male sex (p < 0.001), history of smoking (p < 0.001), tumor location at the skull base (p < 0.001), preoperative Karnofsky Performance Scale score < 70 (p < 0.001), and use of more than two cardiac medications prior to surgery (p < 0.004) all demonstrated significantly increased rates of medical complications on univariate analysis. On multivariate analysis, only a new or worsened neurological deficit remained a significant factor.

### 2022 ESC guidelines for the management of patients with ventricular arrhythmias and the prevention of sudden cardiac death [^1157F8GM]. European Heart Journal (2022). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for cardiac arrest, specifically with respect to post-resuscitation evaluation (cardiac imaging), the ESC 2022 guidelines recommend obtaining echocardiography for evaluation of cardiac structure and function in all sudden cardiac arrest survivors.

### Assessing the association of Kawasaki disease symptoms and echocardiographic findings [^1152JB9o]. Pediatric Cardiology (2022). Low credibility.

Kawasaki disease is an acute systemic vasculitis which can cause cardiac involvement among other symptoms. In this study, we aimed to assess the relationship between the echocardiographic findings of Kawasaki disease with the clinical and paraclinical findings of the patients. In this cross-sectional study, the symptoms of 307 Kawasaki patients were registered, and the association of the symptoms with paraclinical findings and echocardiographic studies was assessed. Among the patients, 190 (61.9%) were male and 117 (38.1%) were female. A total of 193 patients (62.9%) did not have any abnormalities in their echocardiography, while others showed coronary artery aneurysms, perivascular brightness, coronary artery dilatation, and trivial mitral regurgitation in their echocardiography.

A significant inverse relationship was observed between echocardiographic findings and age. Thrombocytosis, conjunctivitis, and oral and/or pharyngeal erythema and/or strawberry tongue were associated with higher rates of echocardiographic abnormalities. Echocardiographic abnormalities are associated with younger age, higher platelets, and the existence of conjunctivitis and oral and/or pharyngeal erythema and/or strawberry tongue.

### Primary malignant cardiac tumors: A rare disease with an adventurous journey [^116bvcVh]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

The detection of cardiac masses during echocardiographic examination is not infrequent. Once a cardiac tumor is identified, echocardiography remains the initial tool of investigation. However, MDCT and/or CMR are commonly necessary to confirm or rule out the diagnosis. Notably, at CMR, the T1‐ and T2‐weighted sequences indicate the chemical microenvironment within a tumor, thereby helping to identify the nature of the tumor.

In studies involving approximately 2,000 patients with cardiac tumors, characteristic radiographic appearances and tissue densities accurately facilitated the diagnosis of myxomas, other benign tumors, and sarcomas. Coronary artery angiography may be necessary to assess the blood supply and vascularity of a tumor arising from or invading the epicardium. This is an essential step in planning for the excision of the tumor. Furthermore, significant involvement of coronary arteries may require resection and grafting.

Positron emission tomography is also useful to detect cardiac involvement with metastatic tumors, atrial myxomas, and lipomatous septal hypertrophy. Usually, a preoperative cardiac biopsy is not considered appropriate, although occasionally it might be considered if the potential benefits clearly outweigh its risks.

Despite increased awareness of cardiac tumors and improved diagnostic techniques, the clinical manifestations can be so protean that the discovery of the cardiac tumor may be incidental during surgery or autopsy.

### Embolic potential of cardiac tumors and outcome after resection: a case-control study [^111H1za5]. Stroke (2009). Low credibility.

The potential for embolic events has been a longstanding concern in patients with cardiac tumors, typically due to the embolization of tumor fragments. However, large-scale studies on the epidemiology and occurrence of embolism in such patients are lacking.

From 1957 to 2006, our institution surgically treated 323 consecutive patients with primary cardiac tumors. Among these, 80 patients experienced an embolic event, including cerebrovascular accident in 31 patients (9.7%), transient ischemic attack in 30 (9.3%), and other events in 19 (6%). Those without a history of embolic events (n = 243, 75%) were classified as control subjects.

The age of participants was similar between the case and control groups (mean 54.5 versus 53.9 years, P = 0.8). A multivariate logistic regression model examined tumor location, tumor burden, tumor histology, and cerebrovascular risk factors, indicating that left atrial tumors (OR, 1.95; P = 0.04), aortic valve tumors (OR, 4.17; P = 0.002), and smaller tumor burden (OR, 2.20; P = 0.01) were significant risk factors for embolism (P < 0.001). Conversely, the presence of mitral regurgitation (OR, 0.12; P = 0.006) and decreased functional status (New York Heart Association Class III/IV; OR, 0.31; P < 0.001) were protective against embolism occurrence. Follow-up data was available for 82% of patients, with a mean follow-up time of 6.17 ± 6.9 years, showing no recurrence of embolic events. A Kaplan-Meier survival curve revealed no significant difference in survival between the case and control groups (P = 0.78).

Aortic valve and left atrial tumors were identified as having the greatest anatomic risk for embolism.

### Cabergoline [^11553k2g]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2020). High credibility.

Physicians should use the lowest effective dose of cabergoline for the treatment of hyperprolactinemic disorders and should periodically reassess the need for continuing therapy with cabergoline. Following treatment initiation, clinical and diagnostic monitoring (for example, chest x-ray, CT scan, and cardiac echocardiogram) should be conducted to assess the risk of cardiac valvulopathy. The recommended frequency of routine echocardiographic monitoring is every 6 to 12 months or as clinically indicated with the presence of signs and symptoms such as edema, new cardiac murmur, dyspnea, or congestive heart failure.

Cabergoline should be discontinued if an echocardiogram reveals new valvular regurgitation, valvular restriction, or valve leaflet thickening. Cabergoline should be used with caution in patients exposed to other medications associated with valvulopathy.

- **Extracardiac fibrotic reactions**: Post-marketing cases of pleural, pericardial, and retroperitoneal fibrosis have been reported following administration of cabergoline. Some reports were in patients previously treated with other ergotinic dopamine agonists. Cabergoline should not be used in patients with a history of cardiac or extracardiac fibrotic disorders. Fibrotic disorders can have an insidious onset, and patients should be monitored for manifestations of progressive fibrosis. Therefore, during treatment, attention should be paid to the signs and symptoms of pleuro-pulmonary disease such as dyspnea, shortness of breath, persistent cough, or chest pain, and renal insufficiency or ureteral/abdominal vascular obstruction.

### Modern meningioma imaging techniques [^116CsEDv]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2010). Low credibility.

Magnetic resonance imaging reveals common imaging features of meningiomas. Most meningiomas display similar characteristics: an extraaxial mass with signal intensity akin to the cortex on T1 and T2 MRI sequences and avid homogeneous enhancement following gadolinium contrast administration. They also exhibit an enhancing "dural tail", reflecting neoplastic dural infiltration or reactive vascularity, or both, extending into the adjacent dura. Low signal intensity within the tumor may often result from calcification or vascular flow voids, a distinction sometimes difficult to make. Meningiomas can be nearly spherical or elongated (en plaque), multiple, and often originate from a dural sinus, an essential consideration for surgical planning. These tumors also tend to disregard the dural boundary, an attribute not typical of other neoplasms.

Although most benign meningiomas are innocuous regarding metastatic potential, they may lead to serious complications due to dural sinus invasion, with or without thrombosis, narrowing and thrombosis of major arterial structures, and compression of cranial nerves and other important neural structures.

### Left atrial papillary fibroelastoma: A rare cause of multiple cerebral emboli [^1173ckiz]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Papillary fibroelastomas have been increasingly described since the widespread use of cardiac echocardiography. Most often diagnosed incidentally, these tumors may embolize, mainly to the cerebral circulation. The aortic valve is predominantly affected, and the left ventricle is the most frequent nonvalvular location.

We present a case of a 59-year-old man who experienced multiple episodes of cerebral ischemic attacks and required coronary artery bypass surgery. The overall neurologic investigation was normal, including a transthoracic echocardiography. However, a 5 x 5 mm pedunculated, mobile mass was described on the intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography. Excision was performed through the left atrial appendage during the coronary artery bypass surgery. Microscopic examination demonstrated a papillary fibroelastoma. This case demonstrates the unusual localization and management considerations of papillary fibroelastomas.

### Infective endocarditis in adults: Diagnosis, antimicrobial therapy, and management of complications: A scientific statement for healthcare professionals from the American Heart Association [^114xKNYf]. Circulation (2015). High credibility.

With regard to specific circumstances of infective endocarditis, particularly in patients with neurological complications, the AHA 2015 guidelines recommend evaluating for intracranial aneurysms. As initial imaging for detecting intracranial mycotic aneurysms, consider obtaining CTA, MRA, or digital subtraction angiography. If these are negative and suspicion remains, conventional angiography should be considered to detect intracranial mycotic aneurysms.

### Infective endocarditis in adults: Diagnosis, antimicrobial therapy, and management of complications: A scientific statement for healthcare professionals from the American Heart Association [^117HrCbq]. Circulation (2015). High credibility.

For patients with neurological complications of infective endocarditis (IE), especially those with severe, localized headache, neurological deficits, or meningeal signs, the American Heart Association's 2015 guidelines recommend obtaining cerebrovascular imaging. This diagnostic step is crucial for the detection of intracranial mycotic aneurysms or central nervous system bleeding in all patients with IE or contiguous spread of infection.

### Recommendations for multimodality cardiac imaging in patients with Chagas disease: A report from the American Society of Echocardiography in collaboration with the InterAmerican Association of Echocardiography (ECOSIAC) and the Cardiovascular Imaging Department of the Brazilian Society of Cardiology (DIC-SBC) [^116oaQJS]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2018). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for Chagas cardiomyopathy, specifically in relation to echocardiography, the ASE/BSC 2018 guidelines recommend setting imaging goals to identify the substrate for heart failure, thromboembolism, and malignant arrhythmias. This includes detecting the presence of left ventricular (LV) dysfunction, LV aneurysms or thrombus, myocardial fibrosis or inflammation, and regional sympathetic denervation.

### A potential misdiagnosis in the COVID-19 pandemic era: A case report of superimposed thrombosis or tumor recurrence [^1167wybr]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2021). Low credibility.

A 58-year-old woman presented with dyspnea on exertion for a duration of two months, along with two episodes of syncope on January 20, 2020. Transthoracic echocardiography showed a well-defined, heterogeneous, large, round mobile mass with attachments to the atrial side of the anterior mitral valve leaflet (26 × 20 mm), suggestive of an atypical myxoma (Fig. 1). Additionally, the patient exhibited a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 55%, severe mitral stenosis, severe mitral regurgitation, mild-to-moderate tricuspid regurgitation, and a pulmonary arterial systolic pressure (PASP) of 42 mm Hg. Coronary angiography revealed normal epicardial coronary arteries, while brain computed tomography (CT) and neurological evaluations were unremarkable.

- **Figure 1**: Large round mobile mass attached to the tip of the anterior mitral valve leaflet (29 × 20 mm), protruding to the left ventricle and producing significant functional mitral stenosis (apical 4-chamber view in transthoracic echocardiography).

### Giant posterior fossa meningioma: The importance of early diagnosis and challenges concerning treatment [^1119Ggov]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). Low credibility.

Posterior fossa lesions may present with behavioral changes and/or progressive neurological deficits. Patients may experience symptoms for prolonged periods, which might be attributed to other causes such as psychiatric diseases. We report a case of a 44-year-old woman who experienced behavioral changes lasting for five years, resulting in the loss of her job, marriage, and custody of her sons. Subsequently, she developed neurological deficits, hydrocephalus, and intracranial hypertension. A giant left pontocerebellar angle mass was diagnosed. A retrosigmoid craniotomy was performed, resulting in total removal and preservation of cranial nerve function. Histology revealed a grade I meningioma.

- **Surgical considerations**: The surgical approach for large lesions in the pontocerebellar angle is controversial, particularly concerning patient positioning and surgical route. A brief revision is made.

Given the increased accessibility of medical imaging today, it is mandatory to obtain brain imaging in patients with behavioral changes and/or neurological deficits to exclude potential structural and curable causes, as evidenced in this case.

### The heart in neurofibromatosis type 1: An echocardiographic study [^116aEBb2]. American Heart Journal (2002). Low credibility.

Comprehensive data are unavailable for cardiac abnormalities in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). The goal of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of cardiovascular abnormalities with echocardiography with color Doppler scan (ECHO) in a large, consecutive series of patients with NF1.

- **Methods**: We studied 48 patients with NF1 (mean age, 10 years). Thirty healthy subjects comparable for age and sex served as the control group. All ECHO studies were performed by the same cardiologist and reviewed by a second cardiologist blinded to the physical findings of the subjects.

- **Results**: Cardiac abnormalities were found in 13 of the 48 young patients (27%). A secundum atrial septal defect with a left to right shunt was found in 2 children. ECHO evidence of mild left pulmonary artery stenosis was found in 1 participant. A moderate coarctation of the thoracic aorta was found in 1 patient. ECHO criteria for mitral valve prolapse and evidence of trivial mitral regurgitation with myxomatous mitral valve was present in 1 case. Mild mitral regurgitation was found in 2 patients. A regurgitant mild flow signal was detected from the aortic valve in 2 subjects. Atrial septal aneurysm was found in 2 patients without patent foramen ovale. Two patients had a septal to posterior left ventricular free wall ratio greater than 1.5, suggesting hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

- **Conclusion**: This is the first attempt to evaluate the prevalence of cardiovascular abnormalities in patients with NF1 with ECHO. The study's most striking finding is the high prevalence of cardiovascular abnormalities in the cohort.

### Meningiomas in lymphangioleiomyomatosis [^112GYwx9]. JAMA (2001). Low credibility.

Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM), a cystic lung disease associated with progressive respiratory failure, is found predominantly in women of childbearing age and therefore has been treated with progesterone and other hormonal agents. However, meningiomas have progesterone receptors, and progesterone is believed to be a mitogen for meningioma cells in culture. Since 30% to 40% of patients with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) have LAM, we routinely screen patients with LAM for brain lesions found in TSC.

- **Objective**: To determine the prevalence of meningiomas in women with LAM.

- **Design and setting**: Analysis of results from ongoing routine screening protocols initiated in December 1995 at the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute.

- **Patients**: Two hundred fifty women with sporadic LAM who were referred for screening by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and/or computed tomography (CT) of the brain.

- **Main outcome measures**: Presence of meningiomas on MRI and/or CT scans.

- **Results**: Eight women with LAM (3 with and 5 without a diagnosis of TSC) had lesions on MRI scans compatible with meningiomas. Five of the patients had been treated with progesterone. Multiple meningiomas were observed in 2 patients.

- **Conclusions**: Women with LAM appear to have a high prevalence of meningiomas. We recommend that patients with LAM be screened for meningiomas regardless of diagnosis of TSC. In view of the lack of a documented effect of progesterone on progression of lung disease in LAM and the reported mitogenic response of meningiomas to progesterone, we recommend that the drug not be given.

### Childhood atypical meningioma with perineural spread: MR findings [^113Pseh5]. Pediatric radiology (2005). Low credibility.

Meningiomas are uncommon in children. When they occur, they are frequently associated with neurofibromatosis type 2. Childhood meningiomas are generally large and commonly associated with cyst formation and an unusual location. Perineural tumor spread, occasionally associated with head and neck malignancies, is very rare in meningiomas. We present the MR findings of an atypical meningioma with perineural spread in a 4.5-year-old girl.

### The spectrum of cardiac abnormalities in patients with acromegaly: results from a case-control cardiac magnetic resonance study [^116KUzL4]. Pituitary (2024). Low credibility.

The cardiac evaluation revealed several findings. ACRO participants showed significantly higher left ventricular (LV) end diastolic volume index (EDVi) (79.6 ± 13.8 vs. 61.7 ± 11.5, p < 0.001) and LV end systolic volume index (ESVi) (33.9 ± 7.8 vs. 23.8 ± 7.0, p < 0.001) compared to CTRLs, as well as a higher left ventricular mass index (LVMi) (57.1 ± 14.2 vs. 43.5 ± 8.5, p = 0.001). Consequently, the left ventricular stroke volume index (LV-SVi) was also higher in ACRO than in CTRLs (45.7 ± 9.2 vs. 37.9 ± 7.1, p = 0.007). However, there was a trend towards a lower LV ejection fraction (EF) in ACRO participants (57.5 ± 6.1 vs. 61.6 ± 6.7, p = 0.069).

The concentricity index (LVMi/LV-EDVi) and interventricular septum (IVS) thickness did not show significant differences between the two groups (p = 0.782 and p = 0.128, respectively). Only one ACRO participant had LV hypertrophy (LVH) according to conventional cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) thresholds. This patient was diagnosed with acromegaly at the age of 32, following noticeable changes in facial and body features. A diagnostic workup revealed severe acromegaly due to a growth hormone-secreting, locally invasive pituitary macroadenoma with a maximum lesion diameter of 19 mm. The patient underwent pituitary adenomectomy and subsequently received SSA treatment due to persistent disease activity. Notably, despite increasing doses of SSAs, disease control had not been achieved at the time of study enrollment, which was two years post-initiation of medical treatment (GH 2.1 ng/ml, IGF1xULN 1.6). Differences in right ventricular (RV) parameters between groups resembled those observed in LV parameters.

### Modern meningioma imaging techniques [^111tE7kR]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2010). Low credibility.

The detection and accurate diagnosis of meningiomas have been dramatically improved by the availability of modern cross-sectional imaging methods, namely magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and multi-detector computed tomography (MDCT). These modalities provide highly detailed information on the structure and composition of meningiomas and offer important insights into functional aspects of the tumor. Once a meningioma has been identified and surgery is planned, imaging plays an essential role. When embolization is performed utilizing X-ray fluoroscopy, it helps reduce blood loss in subsequent surgery.

### Surgical treatment of primary cardiac valve tumor: Early and late results in eight patients [^113wCEmX]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2016). High credibility.

Therapeutic aims are total tumor resection and restoration of cardiac valve function. Surgical treatment should not be delayed because death from obstruction or embolization may occur in as many as 8% of patients awaiting operations. A median sternotomy approach with ascending aortic and bicaval cannulation is usually employed. Surgical resection using cardiopulmonary bypass with cardioplegic arrest is the best method for patients with cardiac valve tumors, whether benign or malignant neoplasm. Valve reconstruction avoids prosthesis-related complications, such as heart block, paravascular leak, or the need for anticoagulation.

If malignancy is suspected or confirmed, and if the lesion appears anatomically resectable with no metastatic disease, resection should be considered. Fortunately, in the case of the only malignant patient (case 5), the tumor, mitral valve, and subvalvular apparatus were completely excised. The patient underwent three cycles of intravenous systemic chemotherapy in 6 months postoperatively. We recommend adjuvant chemotherapy and believe this will slightly improve survival.

Following tumor removal, the area should be liberally irrigated, suctioned, and inspected for loose fragments. Sometimes, it is difficult to determine whether the tumor is benign or malignant based solely on its gross appearance. Therefore, frozen sections of the tumor must be obtained for differentiation in any questionable case. Pathological examination is very important as it guides treatment strategies during surgical procedures.

### A giant cardiac lipoma associated with ventricular inversion and ventricular aneurysm: Ultrasonography and CT imaging findings [^113HQgKB]. Chest (2012). Low credibility.

Cardiac lipomas are rare, mostly asymptomatic, and usually found incidentally during noncardiac examinations; however, they can also be symptomatic depending on their size and location. Here, we report a case of a surgically proved pericardial lipoma that was large and significantly altered cardiac structures. The combination of CT imaging and ultrasonography enabled a precise diagnosis regarding localization, tissue characterization, and complications of the tumor. The origin of the tumor, however, remains undetermined despite a series of postoperative CT scan and ultrasound examinations.

### Cardiac risk after craniopharyngioma therapy [^112irfUX]. Pediatric Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

Although long-term survival after craniopharyngioma treatment is excellent in childhood and early adulthood, sudden deaths in two craniopharyngioma survivors with cardiac findings suggest a need to determine whether treated patients exhibit potential substrates for sudden cardiac death. We present a retrospective review of two index patients with cardiac mortality, which motivated a prospective cardiac screening of 12 survivors. This screening identified nearly a third with significant QTc prolongation. Therefore, QTc-prolonging medication and stimulants should be used with caution in this population, and routine electrocardiogram screening may identify those at highest risk.

### Multiplatform genomic profiling and magnetic resonance imaging identify mechanisms underlying intratumor heterogeneity in meningioma [^116mvmMk]. Nature Communications (2020). Low credibility.

We have identified genomic and radiographic determinants of intratumor heterogeneity that elucidate molecular mechanisms underlying meningioma cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. We find that high-grade meningiomas are defined by transcriptomic and epigenomic heterogeneity, clonal CNVs, and regions with elevated ADC, distinguishing developmental gene expression programs. Among these genes, FOXM1, CDH2, and PTPRZ1 are heterogeneously expressed in individual meningiomas. The importance of FOXM1 for high-grade meningioma growth is established, but our discovery of spatially distinct patterns of FOXM1, CDH2, and PTPRZ1 expression provides a basis for understanding why meningiomas grow asymmetrically. Further, our data suggest that regional meningioma gene expression programs may be driven by compartmentalized genomic rearrangements.

These data can be interpreted according to either the clonal model of cancer formation or the cancer stem cell hypothesis. The clonal model posits that early during tumor development, a single cell transforms to acquire the potential for unlimited growth and that its descendants may accumulate additional advantageous mutations over time. We find that meningiomas are characterized by clonal CNVs early in tumor evolution, suggesting that chromosomal structural alterations, particularly loss of chromosome 22q, are an early event during meningioma growth. Importantly, these data validate longstanding assumptions about meningioma tumorigenesis from hereditary cases. Moreover, while it is known that high-grade meningiomas have…

### Cardiac papillary fibroelastoma: A comprehensive analysis of 725 cases [^1114DvJP]. American Heart Journal (2003). Low credibility.

With the advent of echocardiography, cardiac papillary fibroelastoma (CPF) is being increasingly reported. The demographics, clinical characteristics, pathological features, treatment, and prognosis of CPF are examined.

- **Data collections**: Cases, case series, and related articles on the subject in all languages were identified through a comprehensive literature search.

- **Results and conclusions**: Seven hundred twenty-five cases of CPF were identified. Males comprised 55% of patients, with the highest prevalence in the 8th decade of life. The valvular surface was the predominant location of tumors. The most commonly involved valve was the aortic valve, followed by the mitral valve. The left ventricle was the predominant nonvalvular site involved. No clear risk factor for the development of CPF has been reported. Tumor size varied from 2 mm to 70 mm. Clinically, CPFs have presented with transient ischemic attack, stroke, myocardial infarction, sudden death, heart failure, presyncope, syncope, pulmonary embolism, blindness, and peripheral embolism. Tumor mobility was the only independent predictor of CPF-related death or nonfatal embolization. Symptomatic patients should be treated surgically because successful complete resection of CPF is curative and the long-term postoperative prognosis is excellent. Symptomatic patients who are not surgical candidates could be offered long-term oral anticoagulation, although no randomized controlled data are available on its efficacy. Asymptomatic patients could be treated surgically if the tumor is mobile.

### Vasculogenic erectile dysfunction is a predictor of abnormal stress echocardiography [^116rjPpm]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Erectile dysfunction (ED) and atherosclerotic vascular disease share the same risk factors; furthermore, endothelial dysfunction has been shown to be a common link between these conditions. A high prevalence of silent coronary artery disease (CAD) in patients with ED has been observed.

- **Aims**: The aims of this article were to define the prevalence and identify predictors of occult obstructive CAD in patients with documented vasculogenic ED.

- **Main Outcome Measures**: Duplex Doppler penile ultrasonography (DUS); exercise stress echocardiography; IIEF; CAD risk factors.

- **Methods**: Patients presenting with ED who had penile vascular insufficiency documented by DUS and who had no history of diabetes or symptoms of CAD were prospectively enrolled for noninvasive cardiac stress testing using exercise stress echocardiography.

- **Results**: Forty-nine men (mean age 51.7 years) with an average duration of ED of 2.52 years were evaluated. Penile arterial insufficiency was present in 94% of them, and venous leak in 20% of patients. Comorbidities included hypertension (51%), hyperlipidemia (41%), and smoking (35%). All patients had at least one vascular risk factor, with 40% having two, 15% three, and 15% four risk factors. Ten patients (20%) had abnormal cardiac stress tests. On univariate analysis, age, IIEF-EF domain score, cavernosal artery insufficiency, presence of venous leak, and history of a first-degree relative with CAD were significant predictors. On multivariate analysis, cavernosal artery insufficiency, venous leak, and family history of CAD continued to be predictors of abnormal cardiac stress test outcomes.

### Bupropion hydrochloride [^113tGd9m]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Study findings on bupropion exposure during the first trimester and the risk for left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (LVOTO) are inconsistent and do not allow conclusions regarding a possible association. The United Healthcare database lacked sufficient power to evaluate this association; however, the NBDPS found an increased risk for LVOTO (n = 10; adjusted OR = 2.6; 95% CI: 1.2, 5.7), and the Slone Epidemiology Case Control Study did not find an increased risk for LVOTO.

Study findings on bupropion exposure during the first trimester and the risk for ventricular septal defect (VSD) are inconsistent and do not allow conclusions regarding a possible association. The Slone Epidemiology Study found an increased risk for VSD following first trimester maternal bupropion exposure (n = 17; adjusted OR = 2.5; 95% CI: 1.3, 5.0) but did not find an increased risk for any other cardiovascular malformations studied, including LVOTO as mentioned above. The NBDPS and United Healthcare database study did not find an association between first trimester maternal bupropion exposure and VSD.

For the findings of LVOTO and VSD, the studies were limited by the small number of exposed cases, inconsistent findings among studies, and the potential for chance findings from multiple comparisons in case control studies.

Animal data: In studies conducted in pregnant rats and rabbits, bupropion was administered orally during the period of organogenesis at doses of up to 450 and 150 mg per kg per day, respectively (approximately 10 and 6 times the MRHD, respectively, on a mg per m² basis). There was no evidence of fetal malformations.

### NF2 loss-of-function and hypoxia drive radiation resistance in grade 2 meningiomas [^116TAiUB]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2025). High credibility.

Poor prognostic factors for meningioma recurrence after treatment include older age, male gender, and no or subtotal surgical resection. Imaging findings associated with meningioma recurrence include lack of focal or diffuse calcification, peritumoral edema, greater tumor volume, and close proximity to a major sinus. From a histopathological perspective, brain invasion and high mitotic index have been associated with increased recurrence risk and shorter disease-free survival, respectively. We previously reported an association between spontaneous necrosis and G2M radiation resistance after subtotal resection and radiation exposure, and others have shown that a higher MIB1-index is associated with worse local control in G2Ms after radiation therapy. In this study, we now show that histopathological necrosis and NF2 mutation together are a strong predictor for radiation resistance in G2Ms.

Although other studies have reported that the presence of spontaneous necrosis in G2Ms predicts worse progression-free survival, none have validated our previous findings regarding radiation resistance or explored the molecular pathophysiology of spontaneous necrosis in G2Ms. The role of NF2 mutation, however, has been generally investigated in meningioma prognosis, particularly in the context of molecular classification of meningiomas. Early work suggested that meningiomas harboring NF2 mutations were more aggressive lesions occurring in convexity, parasagittal, and falcine locations, in contrast to non-NF2 mutant meningiomas occurring in the skull base. NF2 mutations have been reported to be the most common genetic alteration associated with these aggressive meningiomas.

### Modern meningioma imaging techniques [^115LmS2q]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2010). Low credibility.

Steady improvements in imaging modalities have enabled a new realm of capabilities in the identification and assessment of meningiomas. The cross-sectional imaging modalities, MRI and CT, have improved in resolution and fidelity. These modalities now provide not only improved structural information but also insights into functional behavior. MRI has, in particular, proven to have powerful capabilities in evaluating meningiomas because of the ability to assess soft tissue characteristics such as diffusion and vascular supply information, such as perfusion. Recent investigational advances have also been made using a combination of X-ray fluoroscopy for selective catheterization followed by MR perfusion measurement performed with intra-arterial injection of contrast. Together, all these modalities provide the radiographer with powerful capabilities for evaluating meningiomas.

### Metastatic carcinoid tumor to the heart: Echocardiographic-pathologic study of 11 patients [^115wV2vk]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2002). Low credibility.

We sought to investigate the clinical and echocardiographic (echo) characteristics of metastatic carcinoid tumor in the heart. Right-sided valvular dysfunction is the hallmark of carcinoid heart disease. Cardiac metastases are uncommon in carcinoid syndrome. Features of patients with metastatic carcinoid tumor involving the heart (MCH) have not been well described.

From 1985 through 1999, 11 patients (8 male, 3 female), mean age ± standard deviation, 58 ± 6 years, were seen who had pathologically confirmed MCH. All patients had echoes, which were reviewed retrospectively.

- **Results**: All patients with MCH had carcinoid syndrome. The primary carcinoid tumor was in the small bowel in 83% of patients, and all patients had hepatic metastases. On pathologic review, the 11 patients had 15 MCH tumors. All metastases were intramyocardial. The MCH involved the right ventricle in 40%, left ventricle in 53%, and ventricular septum in 7%. The average size of macroscopic tumors was 1.8 ± 1.2 cm. Nine MCH tumors were detected by echo in 6 of the 11 patients (55%). Mean echo-detected tumor size was 2.4 cm (range, 1.2 to 4). All tumors noted by echo were well circumscribed, non-infiltrating, and homogeneous. In the 5 other patients, review of autopsy records revealed 6 macroscopic tumors, mean size 0.35 cm (range, 0.2 to 0.4), none detected by echo even retrospectively. Carcinoid valve disease was present in 8 of the 11 MCH patients. The tricuspid valve was affected in all 8 patients (73%), pulmonary valve in 7 (64%), and left-sided valves in 4 (36%).

### Primary extracranial meningioma of the pelvis discovered on screening pelvic examination [^117KThCZ]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). Low credibility.

Many conditions that affect a woman's health can be evaluated through a pelvic examination. Early detection and treatment of a range of gynecologic and non-gynecological conditions, including unusual pelvic masses, may decrease a woman's morbidity and mortality. Here, we present a case of a female patient in her early 20s who was found to have a mass during her first screening pelvic examination. Subsequent imaging followed by surgical resection led to the final diagnosis of a pelvic meningioma. Routine pelvic examinations in asymptomatic women may be more useful than mere screening for cervical cancer and sexually transmitted infections. Once detected, the differential diagnosis of a pelvic mass may include etiologies outside of the gynecological organ system.

### Surgical management of carcinoid heart valve disease [^113PBUW2]. Seminars in Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Carcinoid tumors are neuroendocrine tumors with an unpredictable clinical behavior. In the setting of hepatic metastases, the release of bioactive amines from the tumor into the systemic circulation results in carcinoid syndrome: a constellation of clinical symptoms, among which cutaneous flushing, gastrointestinal hypermotility, and cardiac involvement are the most frequent. Cardiac manifestations, also known as carcinoid heart disease, are secondary to a severe endocardial fibrotic reaction that leads to progressive valve thickening and retraction. Imaging studies commonly reveal severe right-sided valve disease, with fixed leaflets or cusps in a semi-open position.

The replacement of the right-sided valves, including the patch enlargement of the right ventricular outflow tract, is currently the only definitive treatment to potentially improve quality of life and provide a survival benefit. Although cardiac surgery has been traditionally reserved for those patients with symptomatic right ventricular failure, a significant trend toward improved surgical outcomes has triggered a more liberal referral for valve replacement during the past decade.

### Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) PET imaging of meningioma and other intracranial tumors [^1159H1JD]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2018). Low credibility.

This analysis represents the largest report of PiB PET findings in patients with intracranial masses to date. It is also the first evaluation of the sensitivity and specificity of this tool. However, additional studies are necessary to translate these findings into clinical practice. The retrospective analysis included numerous meningiomas but only a small number of individual non-meningioma tumors. High lesion-to-cerebellum PiB PET SUVmax ratios were observed in most meningiomas, particularly in larger non-calcified meningiomas. This indicates good sensitivity for detecting meningioma.

However, to be clinically useful for guiding treatment decisions, high specificity is more crucial than sensitivity. The study demonstrates extremely high specificity, but the analyses are based on comparing meningioma PiB uptake with a heterogeneous collection of intracranial tumors. While this suggests that PiB PET uptake is uncommon in non-meningioma intracranial tumors, the specificity observed should be confirmed in prospective studies involving more cases of dural metastases, as differentiating meningioma from metastasis may be a particularly useful application of this technique. Moreover, all meningiomas identified on PiB PET were either proven to be WHO grade I on pathology or can be inferred to be low-grade due to radiographic stability. Thus, additional evaluation of WHO grade II and III meningiomas is warranted.

### Magnetic resonance imaging of meningiomas: A pictorial review [^1159cetE]. Insights into Imaging (2014). Low credibility.

Axial T2-weighted sequence in a 55-year-old woman with an 8-year history of syncopal attacks demonstrates a large, extra-axial mass over the inferolateral left frontal lobe and anterior temporal lobe that is markedly hyperintense, slightly more so than CSF. There is mild vasogenic oedema present posterior to the mass. Histology was consistent with a microcystic meningioma.

Imaging with MRI may allow the identification of the dural tail, defined as enhancement of the dura infiltrating away from the lesion (Fig. 9) and described in up to 72% of cases in one study. In certain circumstances, the presence of a dural tail may be useful to distinguish meningiomas from other potential aetiologies; for example, in distinguishing meningioma from schwannoma in the cerebellopontine angle, as the latter is not typically associated with a dural tail (Fig. 10). Although common with meningiomas, the dural tail sign is not specific as it is also described in some metastases, glial tumours, and lymphoma. Another important imaging feature suggestive of an extra-axial location is the presence of a CSF cleft between the tumour and the underlying brain cortex (Fig. 11). The cleft may contain CSF or cortical vessels entrapped between the tumour and the underlying cortex.

Post-contrast coronal T1-weighted sequence in a 35-year-old woman with headaches demonstrates a homogenously enhancing extra-axial mass within the right middle cranial fossa with a broad dural tail (arrow) extending along the sphenoid wing and around the lateral aspect of the right frontal lobe. The mass results in [Text seems to be cut-off].

### Modern meningioma imaging techniques [^112KmSHk]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2010). Low credibility.

Steady improvements in imaging modalities have enabled a new realm of capabilities in the identification and assessment of meningiomas. The cross-sectional imaging modalities, MRI and CT, have improved in resolution and fidelity. These modalities now provide not only improved structural information but also insights into functional behavior. MRI, in particular, has proven to have powerful capabilities in evaluating meningiomas because of the ability to assess soft tissue characteristics such as diffusion and vascular supply information, such as perfusion. Recent investigational advances have also been made using a combination of X-ray fluoroscopy for selective catheterization followed by MR perfusion measurement performed with intra-arterial injection of contrast. Together, all these modalities provide the radiographer with powerful capabilities for evaluating meningiomas.

### Management of cardiac disease in cancer patients throughout oncological treatment: ESMO consensus recommendations [^111Jq8aE]. Annals of Oncology (2020). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for cardiotoxicity of cancer therapy, more specifically with respect to cardiac imaging, ESMO 2020 guidelines recommend using the following general principles for medical imaging in patients with cancer at risk for cardiac complications, particularly for the periodic assessment of LV systolic function:

- **Obtain highly reproducible and quantitative imaging**: Use volumetric, non-irradiating techniques, such as quantitative 2D/3D echocardiography and cardiac MRI, with quality control.

- **Maintain consistency in imaging modality and facility**: Conduct serial testing using the same imaging modality at the same facility for each patient.

- **Consider LV global longitudinal strain imaging**: Obtain this imaging technique when available for baseline and serial monitoring of LV systolic function.

### Magnetic resonance imaging of meningiomas: A pictorial review [^117EKV6p]. Insights into Imaging (2014). Low credibility.

- **Epidemiology**: Meningiomas have an annual incidence of 6 per 100,000 and are twice as common in females as in males. They are most common after the 5th decade of life and often remain asymptomatic, with a 2–3% prevalence in the elderly population. When symptomatic, meningiomas present with a wide variety of symptoms arising from compression of adjacent structures, direct invasion of, or reactive changes in the brain, or due to obstruction of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pathways or vessels.

The majority of meningiomas are spontaneous and of unknown etiology. Recognized risk factors include previous exposure to radiation and genetic disorders such as neurofibromatosis type 2, in which tumors may be multiple. Although head injury has been considered a risk factor, the causality in this regard remains unclear.

### Late gadolinium enhancement cardiac magnetic resonance tissue characterization for cancer-associated cardiac masses: Metabolic and prognostic manifestations in relation to whole-body positron emission tomography [^112ieeUJ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

- **Imaging protocol**: Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) was performed using commercial 1.5‐T (95%) and 3.0‐T (5%) scanners. Examinations included ECG‐gated cine‐ and late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) components, which were obtained in contiguous left ventricular short‐axis (mitral annulus–apex) and long‐axis (2, 3, 4 chamber) orientations. Cine‐CMR utilized a steady‐state free‐precession pulse sequence. LGE‐CMR employed an inversion recovery pulse sequence, with images acquired 8 to 30 minutes after gadolinium (0.2 mmol/kg) injection. Conventional (inversion time [TI]: ≈300 ms) and long‐TI (600 ms) LGE‐CMR were used to identify cardiac mass vascularity, consistent with prior methods applied and validated by our group. Conventional LGE‐CMR was acquired in all patients, while additional breath holds for supplemental long‐TI imaging were tolerated in 95% (63/66) of patients with cardiac masses (100% thrombus, 93% neoplasm).

- **Positron emission tomography**: Whole‐body 18 F‐FDG–PET was performed on commercial scanners, with 92% conducted on GE Discovery systems. In alignment with established institutional PET protocols for whole‐body cancer surveillance, image acquisition was executed without specific cardiac tailoring (i.e. neither ECG nor respiratory gating were employed). The protocol involved intravenous injection of 18 F‐FDG (mean: 459 ± 33 MBq) following a fasting period of at least 4 to 6 hours. To ensure adequate metabolic preparation, blood glucose levels (mean: 99.2 ± 25.2 mg/dL) were checked prior to 18 F‐FDG injection. After a target 1‐hour uptake period, a low‐dose attenuation‐correction computed tomography scan (120–140 kV; ≈80 mA) was acquired.

### Incidence, management, and outcome of incidental meningioma: What has happened in 10 years [^114zfufv]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2023). Low credibility.

A Choosing Wisely campaign from 2014 strongly recommended against the radiological scanning of asymptomatic patients after syncope, head trauma, and a normal neurological examination. In our cohort, head injury was among the most common indications for imaging. For patients with obvious signs of traumatic brain injury or presenting with other "red flags", neuroimaging has obvious benefits, such as guiding medical and neurosurgical interventions. However, for patients without symptoms, other factors must be considered, such as increased length of hospital stay, harm and cost from incidental findings, and risk of subsequent cancer due to exposure to ionizing radiation.

Meningiomas presenting with focal neurological deficits and seizures have clear management guidelines, with surgery or radiotherapy as the first-line treatment, but that is not the case for incidental and asymptomatic meningioma. European Association of Neuro-Oncology and Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology guidelines suggest active monitoring, but this seems unreasonable in many of the scenarios where incidental meningiomas are detected. The guidelines further state that treatment should be kept for situations where symptoms develop, substantial growth occurs, or there is danger to sensitive areas. In the absence of better selection criteria, clinical judgment is needed with respect to how incidental meningiomas are managed upon detection. Of note in the results of this study is that during both time periods, around 30% of patients were deceased within 3 years after diagnosis due to causes other than their meningioma.

### Role of echocardiography in screening and evaluation of athletes [^112ZiYuq]. Heart (2020). Low credibility.

The term "athlete's heart" describes structural, functional, and electrical adaptations of the cardiovascular system due to repetitive intense exercise. However, physiological cardiac adaptations in athletes may mimic features of cardiac diseases, making it difficult to distinguish between physiological adaptations and actual disease. Regular exercise can also lead to pathological adaptations that may promote or worsen cardiac disease, such as atrial dilation/atrial fibrillation, aortic dilation/aortic dissection, and various rhythm disorders.

Sudden cardiac death (SCD) is a major concern in sports cardiology. Preparticipation screening (PPS) has been demonstrated to be effective in identifying athletes at risk for SCD. In Europe, PPS includes personal and family history, physical examination, and ECG, with further workup, including echocardiography, only if the initial screening investigations show abnormal findings.

We review the available evidence for echocardiography as a screening tool for conditions associated with SCD in recreational and professional athletes. We advocate for the inclusion of screening echocardiography to be performed at least twice in an athlete's career. The first echocardiography should be performed during adolescence to rule out structural heart conditions associated with SCD that cannot be detected by ECG, such as mitral valve prolapse, coronary artery anomalies, bicuspid aortic valve, and aortic dilatation. A second echocardiography could be performed from the age of 30–35 years, when athletes age and become master athletes.

### Dural-based lesions: Is it a meningioma [^112HWtQA]. Neuroradiology (2021). Low credibility.

Meningiomas are the most common extra-axial intracranial neoplasms with typical radiological findings. In approximately 2% of cases, histopathological reports reveal different neoplasms or non-neoplastic lesions that can closely mimic meningiomas. This study describes the radiological features of meningioma mimics, highlighting imaging red flags to consider for a differential diagnosis.

A total of 348 lesions with a radiological diagnosis of meningiomas, which underwent surgical treatment or biopsy between December 2000 and September 2014, were analyzed. The study determined imaging features that are atypical for meningiomas, suggesting other lesions. The following imaging characteristics were evaluated on CT and MRI: bone erosion, hyperintensity on T2WI, hypointensity on T2WI, bone destruction, dural tail, leptomeningeal involvement, pattern of contrast enhancement, and dural displacement sign.

The results indicate a relatively high prevalence of meningioma mimics (7.2%). Dural-based lesions with homogeneous contrast enhancement (52%) are easily misdiagnosed as meningiomas. Most lesions mimic convexity (37.5%) or parafalcine (21.9%) meningiomas. Five imaging red flags have been determined to alert radiologists to consider meningioma mimics: bone erosion (22.2%), dural displacement sign (36%), marked T2 hypointensity (32%), marked T2 hyperintensity (12%), and absence of dural tail (48%). The most common mimic lesion in the series was hemangiopericytomas, followed by lymphomas and schwannomas.

### The growth rate and clinical outcomes of radiation induced meningioma undergoing treatment or active monitoring [^117R5NTh]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2021). Low credibility.

Overall patient outcomes: The majority of patients were alive at the end of the study period (96.3%, n = 52/54). One patient died due to a myocardial infarction while under follow-up, and the other patient had an existing diagnosis of rehemangioblastoma that was being managed palliatively at the time of radiation-induced meningioma (RIM) discovery. Half of the study cohort had multiple meningiomas by the end of the study period or five years after diagnosis (50%, n = 27/54). Two patients developed eight new RIMs during the study period.

### Stress echocardiography positivity predicts cancer death [^112gKfRk]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

For each patient, follow-up began at discharge and was planned for a maximum period of 40 years, concluding in December 2013. In total, 200 patients were lost to follow-up. Follow-up data were obtained routinely every year in at least one of the following ways: from the patient's hospital record; by contacting the patient's physician; by telephone interview conducted by trained personnel; and during periodic scheduled visits at the outpatient clinic.

The end points considered were death, which included all-cause, primary cancer onset, and new myocardial infarction (MI). The cause of death was based on medical records or death certificates and classified as cardiovascular or noncardiovascular. Cardiovascular death was further classified as cardiac or noncardiac. The diagnosis of cardiac death required documented life-threatening arrhythmias, cardiac arrest, and death attributable to congestive heart failure or MI in the absence of any other precipitating factor. Sudden unexpected death was classified as a cardiac death when an obvious noncardiac explanation was excluded.

Cardiovascular noncardiac death included hemorrhagic stroke, ischemic or undefined stroke, abdominal aortic aneurysm rupture, pulmonary embolus, and other vascular causes. Noncardiac death included cancer, infectious diseases, chronic diseases such as neurological, pulmonary, renal failure, liver/multiorgan failure, noncardiac surgery, trauma (accident/trauma, suicide), and other noncardiac causes; as well as unknown or unobtainable.

When the only information was the death certificate and when the primary cause was stat

### Cardiac calcified amorphous tumor in the right atrium: a rare cardiac neoplasm [^1148uqXa]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2025). Low credibility.

A 46-year-old male, asymptomatic, presented with a cardiac mass, as detected via echocardiography. The patient reported no chest discomfort or palpitations, with no history of syncope. Previously in good health, the patient's examination exhibited clear lungs; normal heart sounds; absent murmurs, rubs, or gallops; and no jugular venous distension or peripheral edema. Routine blood tests, including C-reactive protein (CRP), and liver and kidney function were within normal limits. Echocardiographic examination revealed a slightly increased echogenic area near the atrial septum at the top of the right atrium, with clear boundaries, irregular morphology, broad base, uneven internal echo, and limited mobility.

Transesophageal ultrasound suggested an abnormal echo attached to the atrial septum on the right atrial surface of the lower part of the atrial septum, with no significant activity, irregular morphology, uneven internal echo, and punctate calcification foci, without any blood flow signal, and the atrial septum was intact and complete. Coronary CTA displayed no significant abnormalities, apart from a calcified intraatrial mass in the right atrium (Fig. 1). Our initial differential diagnosis comprised myxoma with calcification and calcific thrombus. Given the mass's size, location, and embolic potential, surgical resection was proposed.

During surgery, we noted a slightly enlarged right atrium housing a firm, medium-sized tumor (approx. 20 × 20 × 20 mm), with a narrow pedicle (approx. 3 mm wide) attached near the tricuspid valve.

### Papillary fibroelastoma, unusual cause of stroke in a young man: a case report [^111VTmg4]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Papillary fibroelastoma is the third most common primary cardiac benign tumor, with an incidence of up to 0.33% in autopsy series. It accounts for approximately 75% of all cardiac valvular tumors and affects men and women equally, with a mean age of 60 years at diagnosis. Despite the benign nature of this tumor, it carries a very high risk of embolic complications. Here, we describe a case of stroke in a 28-year-old man due to cerebral embolization originating from a cardiac papillary fibroelastoma.

### Incidence, management, and outcome of incidental meningioma: What has happened in 10 years [^113waUwF]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2023). Low credibility.

At diagnosis, most patients in both groups were immediately discharged from further follow-up. Active monitoring was performed in 14.7% of patients diagnosed in 2008–2009 and in 18% of patients diagnosed in 2018–2019. Only 1.6% and 0.6%, respectively, were recommended surgery after the diagnostic scan. No patients during either time period received radiosurgery or radiotherapy. On a group level, management decisions at diagnosis did not significantly differ between the two cohorts (p = 0.6).

During the first three years after diagnosis, there was a significant difference in the number of performed follow-up scans between groups (p = 0.04), as 12.4% and 11.2% of patients underwent one follow-up scan. However, in the 2018–2019 cohort, 6.8% underwent two follow-up scans compared to none in the 2008–2009 cohort.

Within three years of follow-up, 1.6% of all patients diagnosed in 2008–2009 experienced new symptoms attributed to the meningioma. No patients in 2018–2019 have yet experienced any new meningioma-related symptoms. After a maximum of three years of follow-up, there was no significant difference in management decision at last follow-up between the two time periods (p = 0.14). However, in the later time period, four patients had been resumed to active monitoring.

- **Patient outcome characteristics**: The total number of patients with follow-up scans may exceed the number of patients initially assigned active monitoring, as some patients had their brains rescanned for other causes, where a change in meningioma was seen, and they were resumed to active monitoring.

### Correlating apparent diffusion coefficients with histopathologic findings on meningiomas [^114Ar73b]. European Journal of Radiology (2012). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to determine whether the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) correlates with histopathologic findings and whether ADC values can be used to differentiate benign from atypical/malignant meningiomas.

- **Materials and methods**: MR images were reviewed retrospectively in 138 patients with meningiomas treated between September 1997 and July 2003. The ADC values were measured in the lesions and peritumoral edema, and the normalized ADC (NADC) ratios were calculated using the formula NADC = ADC of the tumor/ADC of the normal white matter. The ADC findings were compared with the histopathologic findings after resection using the World Health Organization criteria (2007).

- **Results**: Meningiomas were histologically graded as malignant (9%), atypical (14%), and benign (77%). Of the 138 meningiomas, 32 (23%) were atypical (n = 19) or malignant (n = 13), whereas 106 (77%) were typical. The mean ADC values were statistically different between typical and atypical/malignant meningiomas (0.97 ± 0.21 × 10(-3) mm²/s vs. 0.85 ± 0.17 × 10(-3) mm²/s). The mean NADC ratios were also significantly lower in the atypical/malignant group (1.09 ± 0.23) than in the benign group (1.24 ± 0.25; P = 0.002 < 0.05). The mean ADC values and NADC ratios were higher in the angiomatous and secretory subgroups than in the fibrous, meningothelial, transitional, atypical, and malignant subgroups (P < 0.05). The ADC values and NADC ratios were the lowest in the malignant subgroup, and…

### Chromosome 1p loss and 1q gain for grading of meningioma [^115H3GF4]. JAMA Oncology (2025). Low credibility.

- **Question**: What is the role of chromosomal copy number alterations in meningioma, and how can they be used to inform World Health Organization (WHO) Classification of Tumors of the Central Nervous System (CNS) grading?

- **Findings**: This cohort study of 1,964 meningiomas found that chromosome 1p loss in CNS WHO grade 1 meningiomas was associated with outcomes that were highly concordant with CNS WHO grade 2 tumors. The addition of a chromosome 1q gain was associated with outcomes that were highly concordant with CNS WHO grade 3 tumors regardless of initial CNS WHO grade.

- **Meaning**: These findings suggest that inclusion of chromosome 1p loss and 1q gain may inform WHO grading.
