## Question

Thyroid neoplasm is suspected

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about evaluating a suspected thyroid neoplasm. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the initial clinical assessment and risk stratification. Then, I should verify the first-line laboratory and imaging tests. Next, I will review ultrasound risk stratification and biopsy thresholds. After that, I need to check how to interpret cytology using the Bethesda System and what to do with indeterminate results. Then, I will consider molecular testing and its limitations. Next, I should review surgical decision-making and extent of surgery. Finally, I will outline surveillance strategies, special populations, and a concise algorithm, ensuring each step aligns with current guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the initial clinical assessment priorities: I need to obtain a focused history of risk factors (radiation exposure, family history, genetic syndromes, compressive symptoms, and timing of neck mass), perform a careful neck examination including vocal cord assessment, and measure serum TSH to screen for hypo- or hyperthyroidism, because these elements shape pretest probability and downstream testing choices [^112PYsD4] [^116cF3op] [^1178Nh11].

> Wait, let me verify the imaging sequence before jumping ahead: high-resolution neck ultrasound is the mandatory first-line imaging modality for any suspected thyroid nodule, and it should include evaluation of both thyroid lobes and the central and lateral cervical lymph node compartments; I should not order a radionuclide scan up front unless TSH is suppressed, since that would misclassify many nodules and delay appropriate management [^117BQi5Q] [^113wowdY] [^1178Nh11].

> I will now examine ultrasound risk stratification and biopsy thresholds, but hold on, I should double-check that I'm aligning with both ATA and TIRADS frameworks: solid composition, marked hypoechogenicity, irregular or infiltrative margins, microcalcifications, taller-than-wide shape, and suspicious cervical nodes increase malignancy risk and lower the size threshold for fine-needle aspiration (FNA); conversely, spongiform or purely cystic nodules are typically benign and can often be observed; in general, nodules ≥ 1 cm with intermediate-to-high suspicion features warrant FNA, whereas very low suspicion nodules may be observed up to 1.5–2 cm depending on clinical context and patient preference [^112PYsD4] [^115d1TQ6] [^116pnehY].

> Next, I should review cytology interpretation using the Bethesda System; let me think about the malignancy risk anchors to guide counseling: Bethesda II (benign) carries a low risk (~1–3%), Bethesda III (AUS/FLUS) ~10–30%, Bethesda IV (FN/SFN) ~25–40%, Bethesda V (suspicious) ~60–75%, and Bethesda VI (malignant) ~97–99%; I need to ensure results are reported using this standardized nomenclature to facilitate consistent management decisions and communication [^116AQhVV] [^114g2jnh].

> Hold on, I should verify the approach to indeterminate cytology (Bethesda III–IV) because this is where molecular testing changes practice: for AUS/FLUS, repeat FNA or molecular testing can refine risk; for FN/SFN, diagnostic lobectomy has long been standard, but molecular testing can meaningfully downgrade risk and avert unnecessary surgery in a substantial fraction; I should confirm that negative molecular results can reduce cancer risk to near-benign levels and that institutional pretest probability affects test performance, so pretest counseling is essential [^115q7dKf] [^112GK2uU] [^115MrnJZ] [^1176aNX2].

> Let me reconsider molecular testing indications and limitations so I don't overstate its role: molecular classifiers are most appropriate for Bethesda III–IV nodules when results are likely to alter management, and they should not replace cytology in clearly benign or clearly malignant cases; I should also remember that oncocytic/Hürthle cell neoplasms have historically lower molecular test performance, though newer panels are improving; finally, I need to ensure patients understand that molecular results are probabilistic and should be integrated with ultrasound and clinical features [^1126SjfL] [^116Jupin] [^115LCs2N].

> I will now examine surgical decision-making; wait, I should confirm the principle of tailoring extent to risk: for a solitary differentiated thyroid cancer ≤ 1 cm without adverse features, thyroid lobectomy is generally sufficient; for intermediate-risk features or multifocality, total thyroidectomy may be preferred; for cytologically indeterminate nodules, lobectomy provides diagnosis and therapy in one step; I should also remember that NIFTP, while not cancer, still warrants surgical excision and often supports lobectomy rather than total thyroidectomy when suspected preoperatively [^116RiWZ1] [^113q8Dxn] [^112cXmj7].

> Next, I should review surveillance after a benign cytology result; I need to ensure I'm not over-imaging: for high-suspicion ultrasound patterns, repeat ultrasound and FNA in 6–12 months is prudent; for low-to-intermediate suspicion, ultrasound at 12–24 months is reasonable, with FNA if there is significant growth or new suspicious features; importantly, growth alone is a poor predictor of malignancy compared with the emergence of suspicious sonographic features, so I should prioritize morphology over size change when deciding to re-biopsy [^115eiqiG] [^111xdRSk].

> But wait, what if the initial FNA is nondiagnostic; I should double-check the next step: repeat ultrasound-guided FNA with on-site adequacy assessment is recommended, and a 3-month waiting period is not necessary; if two nondiagnostic results occur and the ultrasound pattern remains high suspicion or the nodule grows, surgical excision for definitive diagnosis should be considered [^111N5ACo] [^113PmHAZ].

> I need to ensure I address special populations; let me verify pediatric guidance: children have a higher malignancy risk (~25%) than adults, so lower thresholds for biopsy and closer follow-up are appropriate, and ultrasound should be performed in all suspected pediatric nodules; in pregnancy, defer FNA to the second trimester if possible and avoid radioiodine; in older or frail adults, a conservative surveillance-only approach may be reasonable given the indolent nature of most thyroid cancers and the potential harms of overtreatment [^114Z1EFz] [^1168zeLc] [^116Q5nJk].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of radionuclide imaging so I don't misapply it: a thyroid scan is indicated only when TSH is subnormal, to distinguish toxic from nonfunctioning nodules; if TSH is normal or elevated, a radionuclide scan should not be performed as initial imaging because it will not clarify malignancy risk and may delay appropriate ultrasound-based management [^1178Nh11] [^1175HVFP].

> Let me synthesize a concise, risk-based algorithm to ensure nothing critical is missing: start with history, exam, and TSH; obtain high-resolution neck ultrasound with lymph node assessment; stratify by ultrasound risk and apply size thresholds to select nodules for FNA; interpret cytology using Bethesda categories; for Bethesda III–IV, consider repeat FNA and/or molecular testing; for Bethesda V–VI or high-risk indeterminate with concerning features, proceed to surgery (typically lobectomy) with intraoperative decision-making about extent; for benign cytology, surveil based on ultrasound risk with earlier re-biopsy for high-suspicion patterns; throughout, integrate patient values and local expertise to avoid overdiagnosis and overtreatment [^112PYsD4] [^117BQi5Q] [^116AQhVV] [^116Q5nJk].

When thyroid neoplasm is suspected, the workup should be **risk-based and stepwise** [^114Fch8i]. Start with **clinical assessment and TSH** [^116cF3op]; if TSH is low, obtain a radionuclide scan to assess for hyperfunctioning nodules [^1178Nh11]. Use **high-resolution ultrasound** to characterize nodules and guide management [^113wowdY] [^117BQi5Q]. Perform **ultrasound-guided FNA** for nodules with suspicious features or size thresholds per guidelines [^114VyUze]. Apply the **Bethesda System** for cytology and use molecular testing for indeterminate results to refine risk and guide surgery [^116AQhVV] [^115q7dKf]. Management is individualized: observe low-risk nodules, consider lobectomy for indeterminate or low-risk suspected malignancy, and use total thyroidectomy for high-risk or confirmed cancer; tailor follow-up to risk and response [^116RiWZ1] [^115LcjHe].

---

## Clinical assessment and initial laboratory evaluation

- **History and physical examination**: Assess for risk factors (age, sex, family history, radiation exposure, prior thyroid disease), compressive symptoms, and lymphadenopathy [^112PYsD4].

- **Thyroid function tests**: Measure serum TSH; if low, obtain free T4 and triiodothyronine to assess for hyperthyroidism [^1178Nh11].

- **Radionuclide thyroid scan**: Perform if TSH is subnormal to differentiate hyperfunctioning (likely benign) from nonfunctioning (higher malignancy risk) nodules [^1175HVFP].

---

## Imaging evaluation

Ultrasound is the **first-line imaging modality** for characterizing nodules and cervical lymph nodes [^113wowdY] [^117BQi5Q]. Key sonographic features guide malignancy risk and management:

| **Ultrasound feature** | **Malignancy risk** | **Management implication** |
|-|-|-|
| Solid composition | Higher | Suspicious, consider FNA |
| Hypoechogenicity | Higher | Suspicious, consider FNA |
| Irregular/infiltrative margins | Higher | Suspicious, consider FNA |
| Microcalcifications | Higher | Suspicious, consider FNA |
| Taller-than-wide shape | Higher | Suspicious, consider FNA |
| Spongiform appearance | Lower | Likely benign, observe |
| Purely cystic | Lower | Likely benign, observe |

---

Use **TIRADS** or similar systems to standardize risk stratification and guide biopsy decisions [^115d1TQ6].

---

## Indications for fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNA)

FNA is indicated based on **nodule size and ultrasound features**:

- **High-suspicion features**: FNA for nodules ≥ 1 cm.

- **Intermediate suspicion**: FNA for nodules ≥ 1.5 cm.

- **Low suspicion**: FNA for nodules ≥ 2 cm.

- **Very low suspicion**: Observation, FNA if ≥ 3 cm or growing.

---

FNA is the **gold standard** for cytologic diagnosis and is performed under ultrasound guidance to maximize accuracy [^114zVXo1].

---

## Cytological classification and molecular testing

Cytology results are classified using the **Bethesda System for Reporting Thyroid Cytopathology (BSRTC)** [^116AQhVV]:

| **Bethesda category** | **Risk of malignancy** | **Recommended management** |
|-|-|-|
| I | Nondiagnostic | Repeat FNA |
| II | Benign | Observation |
| III | AUS/FLUS | Molecular testing or repeat FNA |
| IV | Follicular neoplasm | Molecular testing or diagnostic lobectomy |
| V | Suspicious for malignancy | Surgical excision |
| VI | Malignant | Surgical excision |

---

Molecular testing (e.g. BRAF, RAS, RET/PTC, PAX8/PPARγ) refines malignancy risk in indeterminate nodules and guides surgical planning [^115q7dKf] [^112GK2uU].

---

## Surgical management

Surgical decisions are based on **cytology, molecular results, and clinical risk**:

- **Benign cytology**: Observation unless symptomatic or growing.

- **Indeterminate cytology**: Diagnostic lobectomy; total thyroidectomy if high-risk features or patient preference.

- **Malignant cytology**: Total thyroidectomy for tumors > 4 cm, bilateral disease, or high-risk features; lobectomy may suffice for small, low-risk cancers.

- **Lymph node dissection**: Perform if clinically or radiologically involved nodes are present [^notfound].

---

## Postoperative management and follow-up

Postoperative care includes risk stratification, surveillance, and **adjunctive therapy**:

- **Risk stratification**: Use ATA risk categories to guide follow-up intensity [^1144S1Lx].

- **Surveillance**: Neck ultrasound and serum thyroglobulin (with anti-thyroglobulin antibodies) at regular intervals [^1114znwY].

- **Radioactive iodine therapy**: Consider for intermediate/high-risk differentiated thyroid cancer [^115LCs2N].

- **TSH suppression**: Tailor levothyroxine dosing to risk category and response [^116DbFmr].

---

## Special considerations

- **Incidental thyroid nodules**: Avoid overdiagnosis; evaluate only if suspicious features or significant size criteria are met [^112KELhd].

- **Pediatric patients**: Higher malignancy risk; lower thresholds for biopsy and surgical consultation [^1168zeLc].

- **Pregnancy**: Defer FNA to the second trimester if possible; avoid radioactive iodine during pregnancy.

A structured, risk-based approach — clinical assessment, ultrasound, FNA, and selective molecular testing — ensures accurate diagnosis and appropriate management of thyroid neoplasms while minimizing overtreatment [^115d1TQ6].

### Evaluation of thyroid nodules [^114hjWaP]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

This is a brief overview of the initial workup of patients with thyroid nodules. Most nodules are incidentally discovered, benign, and do not require surgery, but the clinician's job is to determine which nodules are concerning and what the appropriate workup should be. Ultrasound examination is the best imaging modality to evaluation thyroid nodules and, when biopsy is indicated, fine needle aspiration is the proper technique to sample thyroid nodules.

### Diagnosis of thyroid nodules [^114VyUze]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2022). High credibility.

Thyroid nodules are common, usually asymptomatic, and often pose minimal risk to the affected patient. However, 10–15% prove malignant and serve as the rationale for diagnostic assessment. Safely identifying and treating a relevant thyroid cancer through a cost-effective process is the primary goal of the treating practitioner. Ultrasound is the principal means of initial nodule assessment and should be performed when any thyroid nodule is suspected. Fine-needle aspiration provides further cytological determination of benign or malignant disease and is generally applied to nodules larger than 1–2 cm in diameter, on the basis of holistic risk assessment. The Bethesda System for Reporting Thyroid Cytopathology provides standardised terminology, which enhances communication among health-care providers and patients. Benign cytology is highly accurate, whereas indeterminate cytology could benefit from further application of molecular testing. The ultimate goal of diagnostic assessment of thyroid nodules is to accurately identify malignancy while avoiding overtreatment. Low-risk thyroid nodules can be safely monitored in many patients with minimal diagnostic intervention.

Conclusions

The evaluation and management of patients with thyroid nodules is no longer a 1-size-fits-all proposition. The tailored approach advocated today requires a careful assessment of each nodule to determine the likelihood that it is malignant and the chances that it will cause symptoms. Very few nodules will require an intensive workup that includes cytology and molecular testing of FNAB samples: for the vast majority, a systematic cervical US examination with assessment of clinical risk factors will provide a reliable foundation for identifying the initial management strategy. After an appropriate initial assessment, the frequency of subsequent surveillance visits for most nodules can be safely reduced compared with currently used schedules. This is particularly relevant for frail, elderly individuals, as they are unlikely to be harmed by the thyroid tumor itself, and overmedicalization can cause more harm than good. In these populations, surveillance can safely be confined to a periodic clinical examination. If surgery is needed, resections can often be less extensive. In some cases, minimally invasive, percutaneous approaches are a viable alternative to surgery. When there are multiple options, they should be discussed as frankly as possible with the patient, outlining the advantages, limitations, benefits, and risks of each. The goal is to identify the best strategy for the individual patient, in terms of disease outcomes and quality of life, avoiding the pitfalls of overdiagnosis and overtreatment. For health professionals, this means learning to work with some degree of clinical uncertainty rather than automatically resorting to intensive testing and intervention, and by weighing patients' expectations and demands.

Importance

Thyroid nodules are common, being detected in up to 65% of the general population. This is likely due to the increased use of diagnostic imaging for purposes unrelated to the thyroid. Most thyroid nodules are benign, clinically insignificant, and safely managed with a surveillance program. The main goal of initial and long-term follow-up is identification of the small subgroup of nodules that harbor a clinically significant cancer (≈10%), cause compressive symptoms (≈5%), or progress to functional disease (≈5%).

Observations

Thyroid function testing and ultrasonographic characteristics guide the initial management of thyroid nodules. Certain ultrasound features, such as a cystic or spongiform appearance, suggest a benign process that does not require additional testing. Suspicious sonographic patterns including solid composition, hypoechogenicity, irregular margins, and microcalcifications should prompt cytological evaluation. Additional diagnostic procedures, such as molecular testing, are indicated only in selected cases, such as indeterminate cytology (≈20%-30% of all biopsies). The initial risk estimate, derived from ultrasound and, if performed, cytology report, should determine the need for treatment and the type, frequency, and length of subsequent follow-up. Management includes simple observation, local treatments, and surgery and should be based on the estimated risk of malignancy and the presence and severity of compressive symptoms.

Conclusions and Relevance

Most thyroid nodules are benign. A diagnostic approach that uses ultrasound and, when indicated, fine-needle aspiration biopsy and molecular testing, facilitates a personalized, risk-based protocol that promotes high-quality care and minimizes cost and unnecessary testing.

### Surveillance for differentiated thyroid cancer recurrence [^1114znwY]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Serum thyroglobulin monitoring along with anatomic and functional imaging play key roles in the surveillance of patients with differentiated thyroid cancer after initial treatment. Among patients with a disease stage justifying thyroid remnant ablation or with suspected metastatic disease, radioiodine whole-body scans are essential in the months after surgery. For patients with low to moderate-risk cancers, ultrasonography of the neck (with measurement of serum thyroglobulin on thyroid hormone replacement) are the best initial diagnostic modalities, and are often the only tests required. In individuals suspected of having distant metastases, CT, MRI, and 18F-FDG PET can make important contributions in localizing residual disease and monitoring its progression and responses to therapy, provided they are used in the appropriate setting.

Abstract

Context

Approximately 60% of adults harbor 1 or more thyroid nodules. The possibility of cancer is the overriding concern, but only about 5% prove to be malignant. The widespread use of diagnostic imaging and improved access to health care favor the discovery of small, subclinical nodules and small papillary cancers. Overdiagnosis and overtreatment is associated with potentially excessive costs and nonnegligible morbidity for patients.

Evidence Acquisition

We conducted a PubMed search for the recent English-language articles dealing with thyroid nodule management.

Evidence Synthesis

The initial assessment includes an evaluation of clinical risk factors and sonographic examination of the neck. Sonographic risk-stratification systems (e.g. Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data Systems) can be used to estimate the risk of malignancy and the need for biopsy based on nodule features and size. When cytology findings are indeterminate, molecular analysis of the aspirate may obviate the need for diagnostic surgery. Many nodules will not require biopsy. These nodules and those that are cytologically benign can be managed with long-term follow-up alone. If malignancy is suspected, options include surgery (increasingly less extensive), active surveillance or, in selected cases, minimally invasive techniques.

Conclusion

Thyroid nodule evaluation is no longer a 1-size-fits-all proposition. For most nodules, the likelihood of malignancy can be confidently estimated without resorting to cytology or molecular testing, and low-frequency surveillance is sufficient for most patients. When there are multiple options for diagnosis and/or treatment, they should be discussed with patients as frankly as possible to identify an approach that best meets their needs.

### Decision making in indeterminate thyroid nodules and the role of molecular testing [^115q7dKf]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Cytologically indeterminate thyroid nodules are associated with a broad range (5%-75%) of malignant risk and accurately informing definitive management poses a challenge. Advancements in molecular testing of fine-needle aspiration biopsies have improved preoperative diagnostic accuracy and prognostication. For indeterminate nodules, such testing ideally will reduce the need for surgery for benign nodules and potentially guide appropriate extent of initial surgery for malignancy.

### Thyroid nodules: diagnostic evaluation based on thyroid cancer risk assessment [^114Fch8i]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

Thyroid nodules are extremely common and can be detected by sensitive imaging in more than 60% of the general population. They are often identified in patients without symptoms who are undergoing evaluation for other medical complaints. Indiscriminate evaluation of thyroid nodules with thyroid biopsy could cause a harmful epidemic of diagnoses of thyroid cancer, but inadequate selection of thyroid nodules for biopsy can lead to missed diagnoses of clinically relevant thyroid cancer. Recent clinical guidelines advocate a more conservative approach in the evaluation of thyroid nodules based on risk assessment for thyroid cancer, as determined by clinical and ultrasound features to guide the need for biopsy. Moreover, newer evidence suggests that for patients with indeterminate thyroid biopsy results, a combined assessment including the initial ultrasound risk stratification or other ancillary testing (molecular markers, second opinion on thyroid cytology) can further clarify the risk of thyroid cancer and the management strategies. This review summarizes the clinical importance of adequate evaluation of thyroid nodules, focuses on the clinical evidence for diagnostic tests that can clarify the risk of thyroid cancer, and highlights the importance of considering the patient's values and preferences when deciding on management strategies in the setting of uncertainty about the risk of thyroid cancer.

### The incidental thyroid nodule [^114wxKwK]. CA (2018). Low credibility.

Incidental thyroid nodules that are found on an imaging study performed for reasons other than thyroid pathology represent a common scenario encountered by health care providers. The initial workup for these nodules comprises a thorough history and physical examination, thyroid function tests, a dedicated thyroid ultrasound, and fine-needle aspiration of any suspicious lesions. Management ranges from observation and reassurance to surgical resection and depends on the cytologic diagnosis. In cases of cytologically indeterminate or discordant nodules, surgical excision (lobectomy) offers a definitive diagnosis, although molecular testing or a reasonable period of observation may be useful as less invasive adjuncts.

### Clinical practice guideline: evaluation of the neck mass in adults [^114WGu6w]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Objective Neck masses are common in adults, but often the underlying etiology is not easily identifiable. While infections cause most of the neck masses in children, most persistent neck masses in adults are neoplasms. Malignant neoplasms far exceed any other etiology of adult neck mass. Importantly, an asymptomatic neck mass may be the initial or only clinically apparent manifestation of head and neck cancer, such as squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), lymphoma, thyroid, or salivary gland cancer. Evidence suggests that a neck mass in the adult patient should be considered malignant until proven otherwise. Timely diagnosis of a neck mass due to metastatic HNSCC is paramount because delayed diagnosis directly affects tumor stage and worsens prognosis. Unfortunately, despite substantial advances in testing modalities over the last few decades, diagnostic delays are common. Currently, there is only 1 evidence-based clinical practice guideline to assist clinicians in evaluating an adult with a neck mass. Additionally, much of the available information is fragmented, disorganized, or focused on specific etiologies. In addition, although there is literature related to the diagnostic accuracy of individual tests, there is little guidance about rational sequencing of tests in the course of clinical care. This guideline strives to bring a coherent, evidence-based, multidisciplinary perspective to the evaluation of the neck mass with the intention to facilitate prompt diagnosis and enhance patient outcomes. Purpose The primary purpose of this guideline is to promote the efficient, effective, and accurate diagnostic workup of neck masses to ensure that adults with potentially malignant disease receive prompt diagnosis and intervention to optimize outcomes. Specific goals include reducing delays in diagnosis of HNSCC; promoting appropriate testing, including imaging, pathologic evaluation, and empiric medical therapies; reducing inappropriate testing; and promoting appropriate physical examination when cancer is suspected. The target patient for this guideline is anyone ≥ 18 years old with a neck mass. The target clinician for this guideline is anyone who may be the first clinician whom a patient with a neck mass encounters. This includes clinicians in primary care, dentistry, and emergency medicine, as well as pathologists and radiologists who have a role in diagnosing neck masses. This guideline does not apply to children. This guideline addresses the initial broad differential diagnosis of a neck mass in an adult. However, the intention is only to assist the clinician with a basic understanding of the broad array of possible entities. The intention is not to direct management of a neck mass known to originate from thyroid, salivary gland, mandibular, or dental pathology as management recommendations for these etiologies already exist. This guideline also does not address the subsequent management of specific pathologic entities, as treatment recommendations for benign and malignant neck masses can be found elsewhere. Instead, this guideline is restricted to addressing the appropriate work-up of an adult patient with a neck mass that may be malignant in order to expedite diagnosis and referral to a head and neck cancer specialist. The Guideline Development Group sought to craft a set of actionable statements relevant to diagnostic decisions made by a clinician in the workup of an adult patient with a neck mass. Furthermore, where possible, the Guideline Development Group incorporated evidence to promote high-quality and cost-effective care. Action Statements The development group made a strong recommendation that clinicians should order a neck computed tomography (or magnetic resonance imaging) with contrast for patients with a neck mass deemed at increased risk for malignancy. The development group made the following recommendations: (1) Clinicians should identify patients with a neck mass who are at increased risk for malignancy because the patient lacks a history of infectious etiology and the mass has been present for ≥ 2 weeks without significant fluctuation or the mass is of uncertain duration. (2) Clinicians should identify patients with a neck mass who are at increased risk for malignancy based on ≥ 1 of these physical examination characteristics: fixation to adjacent tissues, firm consistency, size > 1.5 cm, or ulceration of overlying skin. (3) Clinicians should conduct an initial history and physical examination for patients with a neck mass to identify those with other suspicious findings that represent an increased risk for malignancy. (4) For patients with a neck mass who are not at increased risk for malignancy, clinicians or their designees should advise patients of criteria that would trigger the need for additional evaluation. Clinicians or their designees should also document a plan for follow-up to assess resolution or final diagnosis. (5) For patients with a neck mass who are deemed at increased risk for malignancy, clinicians or their designees should explain to the patient the significance of being at increased risk and explain any recommended diagnostic tests. (6) Clinicians should perform, or refer the patient to a clinician who can perform, a targeted physical examination (including visualizing the mucosa of the larynx, base of tongue, and pharynx) for patients with a neck mass deemed at increased risk for malignancy. (7) Clinicians should perform fine-needle aspiration (FNA) instead of open biopsy, or refer the patient to someone who can perform FNA, for patients with a neck mass deemed at increased risk for malignancy when the diagnosis of the neck mass remains uncertain. (8) For patients with a neck mass deemed at increased risk for malignancy, clinicians should continue evaluation of patients with a cystic neck mass, as determined by FNA or imaging studies, until a diagnosis is obtained and should not assume that the mass is benign. (9) Clinicians should obtain additional ancillary tests based on the patient's history and physical examination when a patient with a neck mass is deemed at increased risk for malignancy who does not have a diagnosis after FNA and imaging. (10) Clinicians should recommend evaluation of the upper aerodigestive tract under anesthesia, before open biopsy, for patients with a neck mass deemed at increased risk for malignancy and without a diagnosis or primary site identified with FNA, imaging, and/or ancillary tests. The development group recommended against clinicians routinely prescribing antibiotic therapy for patients with a neck mass unless there are signs and symptoms of bacterial infection.

### 2015 American Thyroid Association management guidelines for adult patients with thyroid nodules and differentiated thyroid cancer: the American Thyroid Association guidelines task force on thyroid nodules and differentiated thyroid cancer [^111roUKw]. Thyroid (2016). Medium credibility.

American Thyroid Association (ATA) management guidelines for thyroid nodules and differentiated thyroid cancer — scope, methods, and key recommendation areas are outlined, stating that the aim is to inform clinicians, patients, researchers, and health policy makers on evidence for diagnosis and management. The clinical questions were based on prior guideline versions and stakeholder and task force input, with eligibility limited to published English-language adult articles, and evidence appraisal and recommendation grading for therapeutic interventions used the American College of Physicians Guideline Grading System; competing interests were regularly updated, managed, and communicated. Recommendation areas for thyroid nodules include initial evaluation, clinical and ultrasound criteria for fine-needle aspiration biopsy, interpretation of fine-needle aspiration biopsy results, use of molecular markers, and management of benign nodules, while initial thyroid cancer management recommendations include screening for thyroid cancer, staging and risk assessment, surgical management, radioiodine remnant ablation and therapy, and thyrotropin suppression therapy using levothyroxine.

### Clinical diagnostic evaluation of thyroid nodules [^117LDpZi]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

The presence of a thyroid nodule may be recognized by the patient or the clinician on palpation of the neck or it may be an incidental finding during an imaging study for some other indication. The method of detection is less important, however, than distinguishing benign lesions from more aggressive neoplasms. This article outlines the diagnostic algorithm for the evaluation of thyroid nodules including biochemical testing, imaging, and, when appropriate, fine-needle aspiration. In addition, the authors review the natural history of benign nodules, follow-up strategies, and indications for repeat aspiration.

### Contemporary thyroid nodule evaluation and management [^114yxYFR]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

The prevalence of thyroid nodules in the general population is high — up to 60% as documented by high-resolution ultrasonography — but very few of these lesions ultimately prove to be malignant (about 5%). Although epidemiological studies suggest a small but real increase in the incidence of thyroid cancer, likely stemming from exposure to environmental risk factors, the growing number of thyroid cancer diagnoses is largely attributable to the increasingly widespread use of diagnostic imaging technology and medical surveillance, together with improved access to health care in general, all of which favor the discovery of small, subclinical thyroid nodules and small papillary thyroid cancers. These considerations have raised concern over the costs and potential morbidity associated with the short- and long-term management of patients with thyroid nodules, which includes periodic outpatient visits and cervical ultrasound examinations, fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB), genomic testing, and, in some indeterminate cases, diagnostic thyroid lobectomy. On the whole, there is a clearly perceived need for a more refined, tailored, and careful approach to the management of these highly prevalent lesions. Similar considerations can be extended to that amount of nodules that are proven to be malignant, but have a low-risk phenotype, and can be safely managed through more conservative surgery or even active surveillance programs. The aim of this review is to provide an overview of currently recommended practices for the initial workup and subsequent management of patients with thyroid nodules.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for hyperthyroidism, more specifically with respect to initial evaluation, ATA 2016 guidelines recommend to determine the etiology of thyrotoxicosis. If the diagnosis is not apparent based on the clinical presentation and initial biochemical evaluation, perform diagnostic testing including:

- measurement of thyrotropin receptor antibodies

- determination of the radioactive iodine uptake, or

- measurement of thyroidal blood flow on ultrasound.

American Thyroid Association — initial follow-up of nodules with benign FNA cytology: Given the low false-negative rate of US-guided FNA and the higher yield of missed malignancies by US pattern, follow-up should be determined by US risk stratification. Nodules with high suspicion US pattern: repeat US and US-guided FNA within 12 months (Strong recommendation, Moderate-quality evidence). Nodules with low to intermediate suspicion US pattern: repeat US at 12–24 months; if growth is seen — defined as a 20% increase in at least two nodule dimensions with a minimal increase of 2 mm or more than a 50% change in volume — or if new suspicious features develop, FNA could be repeated or observation continued with repeat US, with repeat FNA if growth continues (Weak recommendation, Low-quality evidence). Nodules with very low suspicion US pattern (including spongiform): surveillance utility is limited; if US is repeated, it should be done at ≥ 24 months (Weak recommendation, Low-quality evidence).

American Thyroid Association diagnostic test recommendation framework — strong and weak recommendations are paired with evidence quality descriptors and explicit interpretations for use in adult thyroid nodules and differentiated thyroid cancer. For a strong recommendation with high- or moderate-quality evidence, "Implies the test can be offered to most patients in most applicable circumstances without reservation". For a strong recommendation with low-quality evidence, "Implies the test can be offered to most patients in most applicable circumstances, but the utilization of the test may change when higher-quality evidence becomes available". For a weak recommendation, "Alternative options may be equally reasonable". When evidence is insufficient, "Insufficient evidence exists to recommend for or against routinely offering the diagnostic test". Evidence quality definitions indicate that high-quality evidence comes from "Evidence from one or more well-designed nonrandomized diagnostic accuracy studies… or systematic reviews/meta-analyses of such observational studies… with no concern about internal validity or external generalizability of the results", whereas moderate- and low-quality evidence reflect "possible limitations causing minor concern" or "one or more important limitations causing serious concern" about validity or generalizability.

### Investigation of thyroid nodules: a practical algorithm and review of guidelines [^114esRMR]. Head & Neck (2018). Low credibility.

Background

High resolution ultrasound has led to early detection of subclinical tumors and drastic increase in incidence of thyroid malignancy. To achieve a balance in appropriate investigation without perpetuating an overdiagnosis phenomenon, a concise set of evidence-based recommendations to stratify risk is required.

Methods

We sought to assemble an evidence-based diagnostic algorithm and accompanying pictorial review for workup of thyroid nodules that summarizes the most recent guidelines. In addition, we conducted a literature search and analysis of our imaging databases.

Results

Although many imaging features of benign and malignant nodules can be nonspecific, others, such as microcalcifications, lymphadenopathy, and peripheral invasion, are highly suggestive of malignancy. The predictive values of salient imaging characteristics are presented.

Conclusion

Evidence-based guidelines are available such that a cost-effective algorithm for thyroid nodule workup can be devised. Conservative management with a focus on periodic monitoring is the working clinical consensus on the approach to thyroid nodules.

This article reviews the most current literature on thyroid nodule evaluation, with particular attention to the problem of the incidentally identified thyroid nodule. Although traditional risk factors for thyroid cancer, such as age, gender, and familial syndromes, are still important, the manner in which a thyroid nodule comes to attention is of great importance these days when considering how to proceed in a workup. Most thyroid nodules today are discovered through radiologic imaging tests performed for other reasons. This article covers the key considerations that are vital in balancing the risks and benefits of thyroid nodule workup and treatment.

Nondiagnostic cytology — management and performance include the following: For a nodule with an initial nondiagnostic cytology result, FNA should be repeated with ultrasound (US) guidance and, if available, on-site cytologic evaluation (Strong recommendation, Moderate-quality evidence). A 3-month waiting period after a nondiagnostic biopsy is likely not necessary. Repeat FNA with US guidance will yield a diagnostic cytology specimen in 60%–80% of nodules, particularly when the cystic component is < 50%. Nondiagnostic samples constituted 2%–16% of all FNA samples, of which 7%–26% were eventually resected and malignant in 9%–32% of those resected. Of 104 nodules with two nondiagnostic cytology results, thyroid cancer was found in 25% of those with microcalcifications, irregular margins, taller than wide shape, or hypoechogenicity, but in only 4% lacking these features. Repeatedly nondiagnostic nodules without a high suspicion sonographic pattern require close observation or surgical excision for histopathologic diagnosis (Weak recommendation, Low-quality evidence). Surgery should be considered for histopathologic diagnosis if the cytologically nondiagnostic nodule has a high suspicion sonographic pattern, growth of the nodule (> 20% in two dimensions) is detected during US surveillance, or clinical risk factors for malignancy are present (Weak recommendation, Low-quality evidence). Nondiagnostic or unsatisfactory FNA biopsies are those that fail to meet adequacy criteria, i.e., the presence of at least six groups of well-visualized follicular cells, each group containing at least 10 well-preserved epithelial cells.

### Thyroid nodules: past, present, and future [^111Tmch2]. Endocrine Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Over the past millennia, the evaluation and management of thyroid nodules has essentially remained the same with thyroidectomy as the only reliable method to identify malignancy. However, in the last 30 years, technological advances have significantly improved diagnostic management of thyroid nodules. Advances in imaging have allowed development of a reliable risk- based stratification system to identify nodules at increased risk of malignancy. At the same time, sensitive imaging has caused collateral damage to the degree that we are now identifying and treating many small, low risk nodules with little to no clinical relevance.

Objective

To review the history of thyroid nodule evaluation with emphasis on recent changes and future pathways.

Methods

Literature review and discussion.

Results

Thyroid ultrasound remains the best initial method to evaluate the thyroid gland for nodules. Different risk-of-malignancy protocols have been developed and introduced by different societies, reporting methods have been developed and improved each, with goals of improving the ability to recognize nodules requiring further intervention and minimizing excessive monitoring of those who do not. Once identified, cytological evaluation of nodules further enhances malignancy identification with molecular markers assisting in ruling out malignancies in indeterminate nodules preventing unneeded intervention. And all societies have urged avoidance of overdiagnosis and overtreatment of low-risk cancers of little to no clinical relevance.

Conclusion

In this review, we describe advancements in nodule evaluation and management, while emphasizing caution in overdiagnosing and overtreating low-risk lesions without clinical importance.

Preoperative tissue diagnosis — fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) and core needle biopsy (CNB): FNAB is the first line of investigation for suspicious thyroid nodules and cervical lymph nodes, but has nondiagnostic results in 5% to 15% of cases. CNB may also serve as a primary method for diagnosis for suspected primary thyroid lymphoma (PTL) and anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC), but CNB has a sensitivity of only 68% for thyroid nodules. Most studies are retrospective single-institution experiences with sensitivities in diagnosing PTL of 93% to 95% for CNB versus 45% to 71% for FNAB, and in diagnosing ATC of 77% versus 54%, respectively. Recommendation 28: Core needle biopsy should be rarely utilized in the initial evaluation of a thyroid nodule. (Strong recommendation, low–quality evidence).

Benign cytology follow-up — risk stratification and long-term outcomes: the follow-up of thyroid nodules with benign cytology diagnoses should be determined by risk stratification based upon ultrasound (US) pattern as defined in Recommendation 8. If follow-up US for surveillance is performed and the nodule size is stable, the utility of subsequent US imaging for detection of potential malignancy by nodule growth assessment is very low and if performed, the time interval for any additional US exam should be at least as long that between the initial benign FNA cytology result and first follow-up. A total of 1369 patients with 2010 cytologically benign thyroid nodules were followed for a mean of 8.5 years, and eighteen false-negative cancers were identified; thirty deaths were documented and none were attributable to thyroid cancer. These data support that an initial benign cytologic diagnosis conveys an overall excellent prognosis, and a conservative follow-up strategy is reasonable.

Clinical practice guideline recommendations

Recommendations for the diagnosis and management of thyroid nodules and cancer extracted from these guidelines are shown in Table 4. Regarding the diagnostic procedures, all guidelines advocated thyroid sonography. In addition, a measurement of TSH and free thyroxine levels should be performed in all patients. A routine measurement of serum thyroidglobulin (Tg) for the initial evaluation of thyroid nodules is not recommended. However, although all the guidelines supported FNA as the procedure of choice in the evaluation of solid thyroid nodules, the CPGs define various nodular sizes as indications for FNA. The German Association of Endocrine Surgeons (GAES), IKNL, and Northern Cancer Network (NCN) guidelines recommend that FNA should be performed in all nodules, two CPGs recommend that the indication of FNA must be performed in nodules > 0.5 cm in diameter, and the other three CPGs suggest that FNA cytology is needed when the thyroid nodule is bigger than 1 cm in the absence of clinical suspicion. In the 2013 version of the NCCN guidelines, the threshold for FNA is a solid thyroid nodule > 1.5 cm, if no suspicious sonographic features are present. For laboratory evaluation, four CPGs recommend routine serum calcitonin, particularly before surgery for nodular thyroid disease. Four guidelines suggest a serum calcitonin assay as an optional test, but the American Thyroid Association (ATA) guidelines cannot recommend or discourage the routine measurement of serum calcitonin, because of insufficient evidence. For radionuclide scanning, three guidelines mentioned thyroid scintigraphy in a single thyroid nodule with a low TSH level, and the GAES CPGs recommend thyroid scintigraphy before the planning and execution of an operation.

### Contemporary thyroid nodule evaluation and management [^113MUUSo]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

After the initial diagnostic workup described, very few of the nodules (10.8%) will be subjected to surgery, but a high percentage of those that are resected will prove be malignant (73.1% of the resected nodules; 7.9% of all nodules). Some nodules (14.5%) will require a repeat biopsy, immediately or during the long-term follow-up, to be classified. For Bethesda II nodules, a second cytological assessment is indicated only if the US-based risk class increases during surveillance (frequency: ~15% over 5 years of follow-up). Three-quarters of all nodules (74.7%) will be classified as benign and managed with long-term sonographic surveillance. False negatives (usually the result of sampling errors) are uncommon (less than 3%), but repeat biopsy should be considered for high-suspicion nodules with Bethesda II cytology. Most of these nodules (≈85%) will remain asymptomatic with no signs of growth and will therefore not require any treatment. This estimate is based on findings from a 5-year prospective study of 1567 benign thyroid nodules, which have subsequently been confirmed by retrospective studies.

### Evaluation of a thyroid nodule [^113ZvQ5R]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

The thyroid specialist frequently evaluates thyroid nodules because they may represent malignancy. Nodules are typically found on physical examination or incidentally when other imaging studies are performed. Malignant or symptomatic nodules that compress nearby structures warrant surgical excision. Yet, the majority of thyroid nodules are asymptomatic and benign, so the thyroid surgeon must rely on diagnostic studies to determine when surgery is indicated. Ultrasound is the preferred imaging modality for thyroid nodules, and the ultrasound guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) is the preferred method of tissue sampling. Nodules 1 cm or larger or nodules with suspicious sonographic appearance warrant cytologic analysis to better quantify the risk for malignancy. Molecular biomarkers are a powerful adjunct to cytology. Detecting malignancy preoperatively allows total thyroidectomy in a single operation without the need for frozen section or a second operation for completion of a thyroidectomy if malignancy is found during the initial thyroid lobectomy.

### Imaging and screening of thyroid cancer [^116wXYqC]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Ultrasound is the first-line diagnostic tool for diagnosis of thyroid diseases. The low aggressiveness of many thyroid cancers coupled with high sensitivity of sonography can lead to cancer diagnosis and treatment with no effect on outcomes. Ultrasound is recognized as the most important driver of thyroid cancer overdiagnosis. Ultrasound should not be used as a general screening tool and should be reserved for patients at high risk of thyroid cancer and in the diagnostic management of incidentally discovered thyroid nodules. With prescreening risk stratification and application of consensus criteria for nodule biopsy, the value of the diagnostic ultrasound can be maximized.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: thyroid carcinoma, version 1.2025 [^115LCs2N]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

Oncocytic thyroid carcinoma — diagnosis and adjuvant therapy guidance: Compared to other differentiated thyroid cancers, oncocytic thyroid carcinoma tends to be found at a later stage and is associated with worse prognosis; it cannot be diagnosed on fine-needle aspiration (FNA), and historically molecular diagnostics do not perform well for oncocytic neoplasms, although with newer genomic tests validity is improving and molecular diagnostics should be considered. Surgical management is almost identical to follicular thyroid carcinoma, but locoregional nodal metastases are more common requiring therapeutic lymph node dissections for clinically apparent biopsy-proven disease, and oncocytic carcinoma is less likely to concentrate iodine-131; molecular testing may indicate a benign nodule, suggesting that observation without surgery may be appropriate. Postoperative external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) can be considered for unresectable primary tumors that do not concentrate iodine-131 if disease threatens vital structures and for unresectable locoregional recurrence. Clinicopathologic factors can guide initial postoperative radioactive iodine (RAI) decisions: postoperative RAI is not typically indicated for low-risk patients; adjuvant RAI may be recommended for intermediate and high risk with the goal of decreasing recurrence risk; and RAI may be used to treat known or suspected distant metastatic disease. Data supporting RAI for unresectable disease with positive iodine-131 imaging are limited and inconsistent; iodine-131 therapy (100–150 mCi) may be considered after thyroidectomy for rising or newly elevated thyroglobulin with negative scans (including FDG-PET). Pretreatment radioactive diagnostic imaging (iodine-123 or iodine-131) with adequate TSH stimulation may be considered when distant metastasis is known or suspected; because oncocytic carcinoma tends to be non–iodine-avid, negative scans obtained without single-photon emission CT (SPECT) may not detect distant structural disease.

### Workup and management of thyroid nodules [^112UWNv6]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Thyroid nodules are extremely common findings with a low likelihood of harboring a clinically significant malignancy. Ultrasound is highly sensitive at identifying which nodules warrant further workup with fine needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy. FNA should be performed based on US findings and risk categories. The Bethesda system should be used to classify FNA results. Molecular testing may be offered if the results are likely to change the therapeutic approach. Clinicians should be keenly aware of the potential for overtreatment and should make a concerted effort to factor patient values into the decision-making process.

American Thyroid Association diagnostic test grading — Strong recommendation is when "Knowledge of the diagnostic test result clearly outweighs risks and burden of testing or vice versa". For patients, "In the case of an accurate test for which benefits outweigh risks/burden, most would want the diagnostic to be offered (with appropriate counseling)" and, when risks/burden outweigh benefits, "most patients should not expect the test to be offered". For clinicians, "most patients should be offered the diagnostic test (and provided relevant counseling)" and if harms outweigh benefits "the rationale against the test should, for the particular clinical situation, be explained". For policymakers, "availability of the diagnostic test should be adopted in health policy" and if harms predominate "some restrictions on circumstances for test use may need to be considered". Weak recommendation is when "Knowledge of the diagnostic test result is closely balanced with risks and burden of testing"; patient decisions vary by circumstances, clinicians note "Different choices will be appropriate for different patients" and counseling "should include a discussion of the risks, benefits, and uncertainties related to testing (as applicable), as well as the implications of the test result", and "The decision to perform the test should include consideration of the patients' values, preferences, feasibility, and the specific circumstances", while policymakers state "Policymaking decisions on the availability of the test will require discussion and stakeholder involvement". No recommendation applies when "Balance of knowledge of the diagnostic test result cannot be determined", and then "Decisions on the use of the test based on evidence from scientific studies cannot be made".

### ACR appropriateness criteriaThyroid disease [^115rhQZQ]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2019). Medium credibility.

There are a wide variety of diseases that affect the thyroid gland ranging from hyperplastic to neoplastic, autoimmune, or inflammatory. They can present with functional abnormality or a palpable structural change. Imaging has a key role in diagnosing and characterizing the thyroid finding for management. Imaging is also essential in the management of thyroid cancer. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Understanding the risks and harms of management of incidental thyroid nodules: a review [^112KELhd]. JAMA Otolaryngology — Head & Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Importance

Incidental thyroid nodules are defined as nodules originally detected in a patient with no thyroid-related clinical symptoms, examination findings, or suspected thyroid disease. Medical imaging for diseases in the neck, chest, and spine is a common source of incidental thyroid nodules. They are easily detected but poorly characterized. The next step is to decide whether the incidental thyroid nodule should be further evaluated with ultrasonography.

Observations

Indiscriminate workup of incidental thyroid nodules with ultrasonography is not cost-effective and is potentially harmful. Although the concern for malignant neoplasms drives workup, the risk for poor outcomes without evaluation is minimal. The rate of malignant tumors in patients with 1 or more thyroid nodules larger than 5 mm is only 1.6%, and most small thyroid cancers are indolent. Substantial evidence suggests that a reservoir of thyroid cancers does not progress, and workup after detection with imaging leads to epidemiologic overdiagnosis. Finally, a significant proportion of patients with benign nodules have cytologic results that are not definitive and require lobectomy. Evidence-based recommendations for incidental thyroid nodules detected at computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, nuclear medicine studies, and extrathyroidal ultrasonography include selection criteria for nodule workup based on suspicious imaging findings, patient age, and nodule size. In the absence of clinical risk factors or suspicious imaging findings, workup with dedicated thyroid ultrasonography is only recommended for nodules at least 1.5 cm in patients 35 years or older and for nodules at least 1.0 cm in patients younger than 35 years.

Conclusions and Relevance

Only a few select incidental thyroid nodules require further evaluation with ultrasonography based on recommendations that aim to diagnose clinically significant thyroid cancers while reducing unnecessary workup and provide guidance for clinical practice.

1.8 Preoperative clinical patient features and noninvasive follicular thyroid neoplasm with papillary‐like nuclear features

Although there are no clinical features established or even suspected that definitively prove the existence preoperatively of a NIFTP, many clinical features available to the astute clinician can be pivotal in making management decisions. Presence of significant contralateral lobe nodules, lymph node metastases, tumor fixation, vocal cord paralysis or voice changes, posterior capsule tumor abutment on imaging, or clear radiographic evidence for extrathyroidal extension should lead toward total thyroidectomy.

Additionally, the patient's willingness to have a second surgery if needed as well as medical fitness for potential completion surgery should also be considered in the initial surgical discussion of hemithyroidectomy versus total thyroidectomy. Furthermore, multidisciplinary preoperative discussion should occur and the team as a whole should also be comfortable with plans for less extensive surgery when NIFTP is suspected preoperatively. Once suspected by cytomorphologic, molecular testing, and ultrasonography, the clinical management of a patient with NIFTP should incorporate these clinical features in discussions between the patient, endocrinologist, and surgeon (Table 2).

What to do with indeterminate results?

As noted, the term "indeterminate cytology" refers to Bethesda class III or class IV findings, which are associated with expected malignancy rates of 10% to 30% and 25% to 40%, respectively. The options suggested for identifying these nodules includes repeat FNAB for cytology and/or molecular testing and diagnostic lobectomy. Some data suggest that a repeat US risk stratification can be useful in predicting malignancy and in planning further steps for the management of indeterminate nodules, or at least those in Bethesda class III. However, if nodules are properly selected beforehand, and the pretest risk of malignancy is high, the utility of this approach may be reduced.

Cytological assessment of a second fine needle aspirate is commonly used, but it provides a definitive diagnosis for only 40% of class I (nondiagnostic) and III nodules. If the second cytological study is still indeterminate, diagnostic surgery (usually lobectomy) has traditionally been the only route to a definitive pathological diagnosis. It is obviously expensive and associated with some risks. And if the nodule proves to be malignant, reoperation (completion thyroidectomy) is often indicated, with added risks and costs. Up to 60% of patients undergoing lobectomy for an indeterminate nodule are likely to be over- or undertreated at initial surgery.

### Clinical value of molecular markers as diagnostic and prognostic tools to guide treatment of thyroid cancer [^112yrMeH]. Clinical Endocrinology (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

Advances in our understanding of the molecular biology of thyroid tumours is being rapidly translated into their clinical management. This review summarizes the current use of molecular testing in thyroid tumours, focusing on their usefulness as diagnostic and prognostic tools to guide treatment with consideration of present limitations.

Design

Considerations about molecular testing applications for the diagnosis and treatment of thyroid tumours are divided into four sections/roles: (1) evaluating cytologically indeterminate thyroid nodules; (2) guiding extent of surgery in indeterminate thyroid nodules; (3) completing histological characterization of thyroid tumours and (4) identifying actionable mutations in advanced progressive thyroid cancers.

Results

Genomic testing can improve the presurgical malignancy risk assessment in indeterminate thyroid nodules. However, a prior in-depth analysis of institutional quality and outcomes of sonographical, cytological and histological characterization of thyroid tumours is necessary. Presently, it remains uncertain whether knowing the molecular profile of a cytologically indeterminate thyroid nodule might be advantageous to modify the extent of initial surgery. Molecular characterization of thyroid tumours can be a valuable adjunct to morphological diagnosis in some challenging cases, such as in low-risk follicular cell-derived neoplasms, or rare tumours. Finally, as selective kinase inhibitors are available, molecular testing in locally advanced/metastatic progressive thyroid cancers should also be integrated into the institutional clinical management pathway to improve outcomes and limit toxicity.

Conclusions

Molecular testing needs to be implemented into the local evidence-based clinical management thyroid nodule/cancer pathways to improve its diagnostic and prognostic value and to optimize cost-effectiveness.

### Preoperative evaluation of thyroid cancer: a review of current best practices [^117QiFim]. Endocrine Practice (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

The incidence of thyroid cancer has significantly increased in recent decades. Although most thyroid cancers are small and carry an excellent prognosis, a subset of patients present with advanced thyroid cancer, which is associated with increased rates of morbidity and mortality. The management of thyroid cancer requires a thoughtful individualized approach to optimize oncologic outcomes and minimize morbidity associated with treatment. Because endocrinologists usually play a key role in the initial diagnosis and evaluation of thyroid cancers, a thorough understanding of the critical components of the preoperative evaluation facilitates the development of a timely and comprehensive management plan. The following review outlines considerations in the preoperative evaluation of patients with thyroid cancer.

Methods

A clinical review based on current literature was generated by a multidisciplinary author panel.

Results

A review of considerations in the preoperative evaluation of thyroid cancer is provided. The topic areas include initial clinical evaluation, imaging modalities, cytologic evaluation, and the evolving role of mutational testing. Special considerations in the management of advanced thyroid cancer are discussed.

Conclusion

Thorough and thoughtful preoperative evaluation is critical for formulating an appropriate treatment strategy in the management of thyroid cancer.

### 2015 American Thyroid Association management guidelines for adult patients with thyroid nodules and differentiated thyroid cancer: the American Thyroid Association guidelines task force on thyroid nodules and differentiated thyroid cancer [^1163ybEm]. Thyroid (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Thyroid nodules are a common clinical problem, and differentiated thyroid cancer is becoming increasingly prevalent. Since the American Thyroid Association's (ATA's) guidelines for the management of these disorders were revised in 2009, significant scientific advances have occurred in the field. The aim of these guidelines is to inform clinicians, patients, researchers, and health policy makers on published evidence relating to the diagnosis and management of thyroid nodules and differentiated thyroid cancer.

Methods

The specific clinical questions addressed in these guidelines were based on prior versions of the guidelines, stakeholder input, and input of task force members. Task force panel members were educated on knowledge synthesis methods, including electronic database searching, review and selection of relevant citations, and critical appraisal of selected studies. Published English language articles on adults were eligible for inclusion. The American College of Physicians Guideline Grading System was used for critical appraisal of evidence and grading strength of recommendations for therapeutic interventions. We developed a similarly formatted system to appraise the quality of such studies and resultant recommendations. The guideline panel had complete editorial independence from the ATA. Competing interests of guideline task force members were regularly updated, managed, and communicated to the ATA and task force members.

Results

The revised guidelines for the management of thyroid nodules include recommendations regarding initial evaluation, clinical and ultrasound criteria for fine-needle aspiration biopsy, interpretation of fine-needle aspiration biopsy results, use of molecular markers, and management of benign thyroid nodules. Recommendations regarding the initial management of thyroid cancer include those relating to screening for thyroid cancer, staging and risk assessment, surgical management, radioiodine remnant ablation and therapy, and thyrotropin suppression therapy using levothyroxine. Recommendations related to long-term management of differentiated thyroid cancer include those related to surveillance for recurrent disease using imaging and serum thyroglobulin, thyroid hormone therapy, management of recurrent and metastatic disease, consideration for clinical trials and targeted therapy, as well as directions for future research.

Conclusions

We have developed evidence-based recommendations to inform clinical decision-making in the management of thyroid nodules and differentiated thyroid cancer. They represent, in our opinion, contemporary optimal care for patients with these disorders.

The discovery of a thyroid incidentaloma warrants a systematic approach for those nodules most likely to be cancerous. An optimal management strategy for thyroid incidentalomas should be guided by four questions: (1) Does the incidentally detected thyroid nodule put the patient at risk for an adverse outcome; (2) Can those individuals with malignant thyroid nodules be identified; (3) Is the treatment of thyroid malignancy more effective in presymptomatic patients; and (4) Do the beneficial effects of presymptomatic detection and treatment in these patients justify the costs incurred Physicians caring for patients with thyroid disease should participate in data acquisition in national databases and properly randomized studies, to address the optimal management strategy in the treatment of incidentally-detected thyroid nodules.

Postoperative staging and risk stratification in differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) — AJCC/UICC staging is recommended for all patients with DTC, based on its utility in predicting disease mortality and its requirement for cancer registries (Strong recommendation, Moderate-quality evidence). Postoperative staging is used to provide prognostic information and to enable risk-stratified description of patients for communication, registry tracking, and research. Accurate initial staging requires detailed risk data from preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative assessments, and without these critical pieces of information initial risk stratification will be inaccurate and potentially misleading. Identification of a clinico-pathologic or molecular predictor of recurrence or mortality does not necessarily imply that more aggressive therapies will have a significant impact, and the absence of a risk factor does not mean that more aggressive therapies are not indicated. Until appropriate treatment intervention studies are completed, risk stratification information can be used as a prognostic factor to guide follow-up decisions such as the type and frequency of imaging and biochemical testing.

Although thyroid nodules are a common clinical entity, few (5% to 10%) are malignant and require surgical treatment. Most nodules are discovered incidentally in patients undergoing surveillance for medical reasons unrelated to thyroid disorders. Therefore, a systematic approach to their evaluation is important to avoid unnecessary surgery. High-resolution ultrasonography and fine-needle aspiration have resulted in substantial improvements in diagnostic accuracy, cost reductions, and higher malignancy yield at the time of surgery. In this article, the authors present practical guidelines and a suggested management strategy for the effective diagnosis and management of incidentally discovered thyroid nodules.

Repeat FNA after benign cytology — suspicious ultrasound (US) features, rather than growth alone, are more predictive and should be the indication for repeat FNA: a significantly higher malignancy rate of 20.4% was seen with marked hypoechogenicity, irregular borders, microcalcifications, or a taller than wide shape versus 1.4% with a 15% volume increase lacking these features; risk did not differ between growth and no interval size change (1.4% vs. 0.5%, p = 0.18); similarly, cancer occurred in 1.7% with suspicious features versus 1.3% in those that grew using a 50% volume increase criterion; therefore, the use of suspicious US characteristics rather than nodule growth should be the indication for repeat FNA despite an initial benign cytology diagnosis.

AUS/FLUS cytology — Diagnostic re-evaluation and repeat sampling may aid risk assessment: A second opinion review by a high-volume cytopathologist may be considered and may reclassify many patients into benign or non-diagnostic categories, and overall diagnostic accuracy may be improved. Repeat FNA yields a more definitive cytologic diagnosis in many cases, although 10%–30% of nodules are repeatedly AUS/FLUS. Malignancy rates on surgical follow-up were similar for a single AUS/FLUS diagnosis (37/90, 41%), two successive AUS/FLUS diagnoses (22/51, 43%), and a benign cytologic interpretation following the initial AUS/FLUS diagnosis (2/7, 29%). Thyroid core-needle biopsy was reported by some to be more informative than repeated FNA for nodules AUS/FLUS on initial FNA and is reasonably well-tolerated.

Thyroid nodules are common and are frequently benign. Current data suggest that the prevalence of palpable thyroid nodules is 3% to 7% in North America; the prevalence is as high as 50% based on ultrasonography (US) or autopsy data. The introduction of sensitive thyrotropin (thyroid-stimulating hormone or TSH) assays, the widespread application of fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy, and the availability of high-resolution US have substantially improved the management of thyroid nodules. This document was prepared as a collaborative effort between the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) and the Associazione Medici Endocrinologi (AME). Most Task Force members are members of AACE. We have used the AACE protocol for clinical practice guidelines, with rating of available evidence, linking the guidelines to the strength of recommendations. Key observations include the following. Although most patients with thyroid nodules are asymptomatic, occasionally patients complain of dysphagia, dysphonia, pressure, pain, or symptoms of hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism. Absence of symptoms does not rule out a malignant lesion; thus, it is important to review risk factors for malignant disease. Thyroid US should not be performed as a screening test. All patients with a palpable thyroid nodule, however, should undergo US examination. US-guided FNA (US-FNA) is recommended for nodules ≥ 10 mm; US-FNA is suggested for nodules < 10 mm only if clinical information or US features are suspicious. Thyroid FNA is reliable and safe, and smears should be interpreted by an experienced pathologist. Patients with benign thyroid nodules should undergo follow-up, and malignant or suspicious nodules should be treated surgically. A radioisotope scan of the thyroid is useful if the TSH level is low or suppressed. Measurement of serum TSH is the best initial laboratory test of thyroid function and should be followed by measurement of free thyroxine if the TSH value is low and of thyroid peroxidase antibody if the TSH value is high. Percutaneous ethanol injection is useful in the treatment of cystic thyroid lesions; large, symptomatic goiters may be treated surgically or with radioiodine. Routine measurement of serum calcitonin is not recommended. Suggestions for thyroid nodule management during pregnancy are presented. We believe that these guidelines will be useful to clinical endocrinologists, endocrine surgeons, pediatricians, and internists whose practices include management of patients with thyroid disorders. These guidelines are thorough and practical, and they offer reasoned and balanced recommendations based on the best available evidence.

Solitary thyroid nodules are common entities and the majority of these are benign. The main goal in evaluating these nodules is to identify the [figure: see text] nodules with malignant potentials. A multitude of diagnostic tests is available to the clinician. FNA biopsy is now considered the gold standard diagnostic test in the evaluation of a thyroid nodule. Ultrasound and nuclear scans are also useful tests, but are best used in conjunction with FNA. Clinical decisions are often based on the results of the FNA. A diagram of the clinical decision process based on FNA findings is presented in Fig. 1. Despite the clinical advantages that are provided by the FNA results, the clinician should not dismiss the importance of other clinical prognostic indicators to optimize timely treatment.

### Trends in the surgical management of known or suspected differentiated thyroid cancer at a single institution, 2010–2018 [^112jVVNh]. Thyroid (2020). Medium credibility.

Background: The surgical management of nodular thyroid disease has been influenced by the advent of molecular diagnostics and recent guidelines recommending a more conservative approach to low-risk thyroid tumors. The purpose of this study was to assess practice changes arising from the early adoption of current literature within a single high-volume center. Methods: A retrospective cohort study of all patients evaluated or surgically treated for known or suspected thyroid cancer at a single institution was performed (2010–2018). We analyzed the yield of diagnostic thyroidectomy for indeterminate (Bethesda III and IV) nodules, the choice of initial operation for likely malignant (Bethesda V and VI) nodules, and the rate of completion thyroidectomy. The Cochran-Armitage test was used to assess the significance of any observed trends. Results: Of 2497 patients who underwent initial thyroidectomy from 2010 to 2018, 1791 patients had a tissue diagnosis of suspected or known thyroid cancer by cytopathology (Bethesda III-VI) or surgical pathology (differentiated thyroid cancer). In patients with likely malignant nodules but no clinical evidence of invasive or metastatic disease, the proportion managed with total thyroidectomy plus prophylactic neck dissection fell from 50% to 10% (p = 0.007). The proportion with likely malignant nodules managed definitively with thyroid lobectomy rose from 2% to 19% (p < 0.001). The rate of completion thyroidectomy for thyroid cancer found in the initial lobectomy specimen declined from 73% to 26% (p < 0.001). Among all patients with cytologically indeterminate nodules (n = 1036), we observed a decrease in the rate of diagnostic thyroidectomy from 67% to 35% over the study period (p = 0.015). Conclusions: The early adoption of new diagnostic technology and management guidelines has manifested in a less aggressive surgical approach to known or suspected thyroid cancer. Long-term follow-up will be required to assess oncologic and patient-centered outcomes arising from this modern strategy.

Cytology and molecular testing

Fine-needle aspiration cytology is the next step in the triage of a thyroid nodule. It should be reserved for lesions found to be sufficiently suspicious on the basis of US and clinical findings. The results play a key role in optimizing subsequent management. The Bethesda System for Reporting Thyroid Cytopathology (BSRTC) was discussed in 2007 by a panel of experts at the U.S. National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, MD. The first edition of the system was published in 2010, and an updated version followed in 2018. The BSRTC is widely used in the United States, and it has served as a model for similar tiered classification schemes developed more recently in other parts of the world.

The robust diagnostic framework provided by the BSRTC offers valuable guidance in developing management strategies for patients with thyroid nodules. Nonetheless, several potential diagnostic pitfalls exist that can lead to false-positive, false-negative, nondiagnostic, or indeterminate results. Cytology itself has limitations: it cannot, for example, distinguish between follicular-patterned hyperplastic/adenomatoid nodules, follicular adenomas, follicular carcinoma, and some cases of follicular variants of papillary thyroid carcinoma. Thyroid cytology can be considered only a screening test for these follicular-patterned lesions, the results of which will almost invariably reported as "indeterminate", that is, assigned to Bethesda class III ("atypia of undetermined significance" or "follicular lesions of undetermined significance") or IV ("follicular neoplasm or suspicious for a follicular [or Hürthle cell] neoplasm"). For most papillary thyroid cancers, as well as medullary, poorly differentiated, and undifferentiated carcinomas, the cytology report will usually be unambiguously diagnostic (Bethesda class VI, malignant), whereas some degree of uncertainty persists for nodules assigned to Bethesda class V (suspicious for malignancy) nodules, which is associated with a very broad range of malignancy risks.

Diagnostic test appraisal scope and development — "Frequently in these guidelines, the accuracy of the diagnosis of thyroid cancer (relative to a histologic gold standard) was the diagnostic outcome unless otherwise specified", and "prognostic, disease staging, or risk stratification studies were also included in the grading scheme of diagnostic studies". The panel noted that "the ACP Guideline Grading System is not designed for this purpose", and "We reviewed a number of appraisal systems for diagnostic tests, but some of the complexity and the time-consuming nature of some systems limited their feasibility for implementation in our group (27–31)". Consequently, "We drafted, revised, and piloted the use of a newly developed diagnostic test appraisal system that was acceptable to panel members", and for such systems "the implication for use would be on the part of the clinician, in reporting results in the medical record and communicating them to the patient (at the applicable time point in disease or follow-up trajectory), as opposed to offering a specific choice of staging/risk stratification system to the patient".

### Thyroid nodules: diagnosis and management [^115d1TQ6]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2024). High credibility.

Thyroid nodules, with a prevalence of almost 25% in the general population, are a common occurrence. Their prevalence varies considerably depending on demographics such as age and sex as well as the presence of risk factors. This article provides a comprehensive overview of the prevalence, risk stratification and current management strategies for thyroid nodules, with a particular focus on changes in diagnostic and therapeutic protocols that have occurred over the past 10 years. Several sonography-based stratification systems (such as Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data Systems (TIRADS)) might help to predict the malignancy risk of nodules, potentially eliminating the need for biopsy in many instances. However, large or suspicious nodules necessitate cytological evaluation following fine-needle aspiration biopsy for accurate classification. In the case of cytology yielding indeterminate results, additional tools, such as molecular testing, can assist in guiding the management plan. Surgery is no longer the only treatment for symptomatic or malignant nodules: active surveillance or local ablative treatments might be beneficial for appropriately selected patients. To enhance clinician-patient interactions and discussions about diagnostic options, shared decision-making tools have been developed. A personalized, risk-based protocol promotes high-quality care while minimizing costs and unnecessary testing.

### A genomic alternative to identify medullary thyroid cancer preoperatively in thyroid nodules with indeterminate cytology [^112sRn3r]. Thyroid (2016). Low credibility.

Unfortunately, many sMTC patients undergo suboptimal preoperative evaluations and initial surgical interventions, resulting in additional "completion" surgeries and/or compromised patient outcomes. Appropriate surgery results in fewer local reoperations and more frequent biochemical cure. In addition, when MTC is not suspected, more than one-quarter of patients with cytologically indeterminate fine-needle aspiration biopsies (FNABs) do not undergo surgical resection in the short term, an approach that would delay the diagnosis and treatment of MTCs missed by cytology. Conversely, a false diagnosis of MTC can lead to an overly aggressive surgery.

Many approaches for improving the preoperative diagnosis of MTC have been suggested, and some implemented, with varying degrees of success. A negative result on a large mutation panel does not adequately exclude sporadic MTC. As medullary thyroid tumors often overproduce calcitonin, screening for its production, either by immunohistochemistry, or by measurement in the serum, has been a focus of diagnostic efforts. The presence of MTC across all six Bethesda cytopathology categories requires that any testing paradigm take into account this distribution when testing for MTC, and must be considered against a backdrop of its rarity. Efforts to improve the diagnostic FNAB pathway could include making a cell block on every FNAB and performing immunohistochemical staining for calcitonin on those that are not cytologically benign. This approach is often challenged by insufficient residual cells for production of the cell block, as well as cost given the rarity of MTC. In addition, sMTC seem to be less frequently immunoreactive for calcitonin (74–79%) than familial cases are (100%). Serum calcitonin screening is limited by lack of agreement on the calcitonin threshold to suspect MTC, no prospective randomized studies demonstrating improved patient outcome by calcitonin screening, and questions about cost-effectiveness not only given the rarity of MTC but also because of the downstream effects of false positive results. While serum calcitonin screening is accepted in some countries such as Germany and Italy, it is not uniformly accepted in the United States and elsewhere, resulting partly from its high false positive rate (60–90%) and low positive predictive value (PPV) of 10–40%. Thus, serum calcitonin screening thresholds with high sensitivity may drive unnecessary MTC-related testing and surgery in patients who do not have MTC.

AACE/ACE/AME thyroid nodules — ultrasound (US) indications and objectives: High-resolution US is the most sensitive test available for detecting thyroid nodules, measuring their dimensions, identifying their content, and evaluating any associated changes in the thyroid gland. If results of palpation are normal, US should be performed when a thyroid nodule is suspected on clinical grounds or risk factors have been recognized. In all patients with palpable thyroid nodules or multinodular goiters (MNGs), US should be performed to achieve the following: aid in the diagnosis of diffuse causes (e.g., chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis), look for coincidental thyroid nodules or diffuse thyroid gland changes, detect US features suggestive of malignancy and select the lesions for biopsy, assess the presence of extracapsular growth or suspicious lymph nodes, and obtain an objective measure of the baseline volume of the thyroid gland and of lesions assigned to follow-up or nonsurgical therapy.

### Utility of repeat cytological assessment of thyroid nodules initially classified as benign: clinical insights from multidisciplinary care in an Irish tertiary referral centre [^114ZLhGv]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Thyroid nodules are palpable in 5% of the population in iodine sufficient regions and in a much higher percentage in iodine deficient countries. However, neck ultrasound (US) identifies nodules in almost 40% of the population. The majority of nodules are benign with malignancy diagnosed in approximately 5–12% of ultrasound detected nodules.

An increasing number of thyroid nodules are incidentally detected by various modalities of imaging of the neck and thorax and contribute to an increased workload for endocrinologists, pathologists and radiologists. Several international societies have produced multidisciplinary guidelines for the assessment and management of thyroid nodules. The overall objective of clinicians is to diagnose malignancy pre-operatively in patients with thyroid carcinoma and to limit unnecessary surgery in the vast majority with benign nodules. Neck ultrasound and fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) are promoted as the tools of choice for diagnosis.

Nodules classified as "benign" on cytology, following FNAB, account for the greatest proportion of cases seen in routine clinical practice. However, cytological assessment of samples is somewhat subjective with several factors influencing the diagnostic outcome including the experience of the cytopathologist, as well as the adequacy of the sample. The negative predictive value of a "benign" cytology result is difficult to define and concern exists over false negative (falsely reassuring) results typically ranging from 1–11%, potentially resulting in missed cancer diagnosis. All guidelines recommend clinical follow-up for this group of patients. However, debate exists regarding the need for repeat cytological aspiration for nodules initially classified as benign.

Thyroid nodules are a common clinical problem encountered in an endocrine practice. More and more thyroid nodules are now being detected on unrelated imaging studies, leading to an increased diagnosis of low-risk thyroid cancers. There is therefore a greater emphasis on risk assessment based on clinical and sonographic features to avoid morbidity secondary to unnecessary therapy. Molecular diagnostics are also being widely used to further characterize indeterminate nodules. The American Thyroid Association and American College of Radiology-Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System guidelines are the most commonly used in clinical practice for risk assessment.

The sonographically estimated malignancy risk also provides guidance in planning effective follow-up (Fig. 2). The algorithm shown in the figure is based on literature data, practice guidelines, and the authors' own experience. Thyroid FNAB cytology has a very low false-negative rate (< 3%); similar findings have been reported for molecular analysis of FNAB fluid (Table 2). However, nodules with highly suspicious features on the initial US examination — even if they have been cytologically or molecularly classified as benign — warrant a repeat biopsy within 12 months. Repeat biopsy is also indicated if new suspicious features or significant growth is observed during follow-up. In a subgroup analysis of a prospective cohort, the US-estimated malignancy risk class of 13.2% to 29.4% of the nodules increased during the first 5 years of follow-up. However, the risk-class increase was associated with a recommendation for FNAB for only 6% to 8% of the nodules whose biopsies had been deferred at baseline, and none of the increased risk estimates was associated with discovery of a new malignancy. The development of new nodules is quite common during surveillance, but only 3% to 7% of these lesions meet the criteria for biopsy. Some authors maintain that a sonographically documented change in the appearance of a nodule classified as benign (particularly its margins) is the most reliable indication for repeat FNAB. The growth alone of a such nodules emerged from a meta-analysis as a relatively poor predictor of malignancy. More recently, however, a prospective study found that nodules displaying significant growth during follow-up (diameter increases exceeding 2 mm per year) are significantly more likely to be malignant than slower growing nodules (relative risk, 2.5; 95% confidence interval, 1.6–3.1; P < 0.001) and therefore warrant repeat biopsy. Growth is also a concern because it can cause compressive symptoms. Size increases are more likely in younger individuals and patients with multiple or large nodules.

### Clinical outcome for atypia of undetermined significance in thyroid fine-needle aspirations: should repeated fna be the preferred initial approach? [^116LEauk]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2011). Low credibility.

In the Bethesda System for reporting thyroid fine-needle aspirations (FNAs), atypia of undetermined significance (AUS) is a category with limited reported follow-up and outcome data. We report a retrospective analysis of our institution's experience during nearly 4.5 years with a tiered classification scheme conforming to the Bethesda System in which repeated FNA was recommended for most patients with an initial AUS diagnosis. Of 4,691 thyroid FNAs, 512 (10.9%) had a diagnosis of AUS. Cytologic or histologic outcome data were available for 331 cases (64.6%), of which 240 (72.5%) were benign and 91 (27.5%) were malignant. Of patients with a surgical diagnosis, there was no statistically significant difference in malignancy rate among patients who went directly to surgery after a single AUS diagnosis (37/90 [41%]), patients having 2 successive AUS FNA diagnoses (22/51 [43%]), and patients with a benign aspirate after AUS (2/7 [29%]). Although AUS confers an intermediate risk of malignancy, guidelines recommending repeated FNA for most cases should be reevaluated.

### AHNS series: Do you know your guidelines? AHNS endocrine section consensus statement: state-of-the-art thyroid surgical recommendations in the era of noninvasive follicular thyroid neoplasm with papillary-like nuclear features [^113q8Dxn]. Head & Neck (2018). Low credibility.

1.2 Noninvasive follicular thyroid neoplasm with papillary‐like nuclear features and presurgical evaluation

The paradigm shift in terminology presented by NIFTP, will affect clinical management with deescalation of postoperative thyroid hormone suppression of thyroid‐stimulating hormone and radioactive iodine therapeutic modalities, and allow for increased intervals between follow‐up appointments. The challenge, however, is how to provide the surgeon with reliable and actionable information before the histological diagnosis in order to optimally enlighten initial surgical planning. Inevitably, the emergence of NIFTP, due to its depression of ultimate rates of malignancy, will result in the initial surgical pendulum swinging to some degree toward more conservative options in the form of lobectomy as opposed to initial total thyroidectomy. The degree to which the pendulum will swing is yet to be determined and will be affected by many factors. This section is intended to increase the acuity of the surgical preoperative evaluation in an attempt to identify those patients whose final pathology report may ultimately denote NIFTP and can, therefore, be offered a conservative surgical plan in the form of a lobectomy as opposed to total thyroidectomy.

1.3 Noninvasive follicular thyroid neoplasm with papillary‐like nuclear features cannot be definitively diagnosed preoperatively

The ability to detect NIFTP preoperatively is clearly challenging as it is a histologic diagnosis; predicting its presence preoperatively relies on preoperative informed speculation and is not a perfect endeavor.

1.4 Noninvasive follicular thyroid neoplasm with papillary‐like nuclear features is a surgical target

The second important point is that NIFTP is considered a precancerous lesion and is thereby an appropriate surgical target. Although not a cancer, NIFTP requires surgical removal and histologic evaluation. Statistical accuracy assessment of fine‐needle aspiration (FNA) varies based on the specific definition of disease, which can be defined as malignancy or simply as disease requiring surgical resection. 3

The existence of NIFTP results in a decreased rate of thyroid cancer overall and will, therefore, tend to lead to lobectomy versus total thyroidectomy in appropriately selected patients. However, total thyroidectomy remains an acceptable option for some cases ultimately defined as NIFTP.

Given our imperfect ability to preoperatively diagnose NIFTP and a specific patient's other clinical factors that may lead towards more extensive surgery, total thyroidectomy remains a valid, acceptable, and potentially preferable option even when the ultimate pathology report reveals NIFTP. This situation requires thorough preoperative counseling in conjunction with endocrinology.

Molecular testing — When molecular testing should be considered: to complement not replace cytologic evaluation, the results are expected to influence clinical management, and as a general rule, not recommended in nodules with established benign or malignant cytologic characteristics. For cytologically indeterminate nodules, cytopathology expertise, patient characteristics, and prevalence of malignancy within the population being tested impact the negative predictive values (NPVs).

### Who is diagnosing pediatric thyroid nodules? A tertiary children's hospital review [^1168zeLc]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Pediatric thyroid nodules are identified in 1% to 1.7% of children. Although thyroid nodules are less frequent in the pediatric population than in adults, pediatric thyroid nodules have a higher risk of malignancy. Although 5% to 10% of adult thyroid nodules are malignant, up to 25% of pediatric thyroid nodules may be malignant. Notable risk factors for malignancy include radiation exposure, family history of thyroid cancer, and history of genetic cancer syndromes. Definitive diagnosis of thyroid malignancy requires either a fine needle aspiration biopsy or resection of thyroid tissue. Like in adults, malignancy may be suggested by nodule size, irregular margins, and other ultrasonographic signs, although adult thyroid imaging recommendations may miss some malignancies in children.

Multiple studies have identified an increase in the frequency of pediatric thyroid cancer, with a study examining pediatric thyroid cancer from 1998 to 2013 describing an increase in all stages and sizes of differentiated thyroid cancer. Because of the rising rate of pediatric thyroid cancer, it is important to understand the diagnostic process and management of pediatric thyroid nodules. Previous literature has outlined concerning factors that encourage a physician to consider malignancy, including the size of the thyroid nodule. However, little is known about how these patients first encounter the medical system, as well as how diagnosing provider type influences potential interventions. Our article addresses these questions by evaluating which providers are the point‐of‐entry for pediatric patients with thyroid nodules and investigating how nodule size relates to the type of diagnosing provider. Additionally, we examine the initial diagnostic method, work‐up, intervention, and proportion of malignant nodules for each provider type.

### Medullary thyroid cancer… [^116RwVMK]. NCI (2019). Medium credibility.

Thyroid Cancer Diagnosis Over the last two decades, a major concern regarding thyroid cancer has been overdiagnosis
- that is, the detection of small, slow-growing thyroid tumors that may never cause a medical problem. These tumors, also called nodules, are detected through screening, either by feeling the neck or using ultrasound. When a suspicious nodule is found on a person's thyroid, a fine needle biopsy is often used to determine whether the mass is cancerous. However, up to one-third of the time, pathologists can't determine from the appearance of the cells whether a nodule is cancerous. In the past, people with inconclusive biopsy results would have had to undergo removal of the half of the thyroid that contained the suspicious mass. In many cases, this turned out to be overtreatment because the mass did not contain cancer.

In the last several years, however, NCI-funded researchers have developed genomic tests that can help tell whether such inconclusive nodules are cancerous and require surgery. These tests have the potential to spare many people potentially unnecessary surgery. In the future, the tests may also be used to select treatments that match the genetic characteristics of individual cancers and determine how much of the thyroid to remove. One of the proteins that sorafenib blocks is produced by the BRAF gene. In some people, an altered form of this gene promotes the development of aggressive papillary thyroid cancer. Other drugs that target altered forms of the B-Raf protein are being tested in people whose papillary thyroid cancer has recurred or progressed despite treatment. NCI scientists are also studying how the B-Raf protein interacts with other proteins to promote tumor growth, with the goal of identifying new drugs that target these interactions.

In addition, researchers are looking for other genetic alterations in papillary or follicular thyroid cancer that could be targeted with new treatments. Recent drug approvals include: BRAF gene. About a quarter of anaplastic thyroid cancers carry this mutation. Scientists at NCI and elsewhere are now looking for other mutations in anaplastic thyroid cancer that could be targeted with existing drugs. Through the collaboration between NCI's Surgical Oncology Program and the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, researchers are screening drugs approved for other conditions for the potential use of treating anaplastic thyroid cancer. Any promising drugs will eventually be tested at the NIH Clinical Center.

### Test identifies thyroid nodules that don't require surgery-NCI… [^1155ec9E]. NCI (2018). Low credibility.

Genomic Test Helps Identify Thyroid Nodules That Don't Require Surgery, by NCI Staff A new study has found that a test that measures genomic changes in tissue samples taken from the thyroid can help identify which patients likely need diagnostic surgery for thyroid cancer and which do not. When a suspicious small growth or lump is found in the thyroid, doctors perform a fine-needle biopsy so that the cells can be examined by a pathologist. But up to one-third of the time, pathologists can't determine from the appearance of the cells whether the nodule is cancerous, explained the study's lead investigator, Yuri Nikiforov, M. D. Ph. D., of the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. Typically, people with indeterminate results go on to diagnostic surgery — the removal of the thyroid lobe that harbors the nodule. But most of these nodules turn out not to be cancer.

So researchers have long been interested in developing molecular tests to assess indeterminate biopsy samples. The genomic test used in this new study was able to accurately identify indeterminate biopsy samples that, after surgery, were found to be benign, the researchers reported November 8 in JAMA Oncology. The test is one of several genomic classifiers for thyroid nodules that are starting to be used in the United States. The goal of developing this type of genetic test "is to safely prevent unnecessary surgeries, " Dr. Nikiforov said. The test generates a score based on how strongly each change found in a given tumor is associated with thyroid cancer. The cutoff for identifying a nodule as benign or cancerous was defined in a previous study by the team. For the new study, the researchers recruited 232 people who were already scheduled to undergo diagnostic surgery following an indeterminate thyroid biopsy.

After surgery, pathology results from the removed nodule were compared with the results from the genomic classifier test, which had been performed before surgery. Overall, the ThyroSeq test carried out on the biopsy samples taken before surgery classified 61% of the nodules as benign and 39% as cancerous. ThyroSeq correctly identified 94% of the nodules that were shown to be cancerous after surgery. The test performed about as well in all subtypes of thyroid cancer found in the study, including rare Hurthle cell neoplasms.
