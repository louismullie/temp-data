## Question

Significance of high RDW and normal reticulocyte count

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the significance of a high RDW with a normal reticulocyte count. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what RDW actually measures and why it rises. Then, I should verify what a normal reticulocyte count implies about marrow response. Next, I will integrate these two findings to generate a prioritized differential diagnosis. After that, I should consider prognostic implications and when to escalate workup. Finally, I will outline a practical, stepwise evaluation plan with key tests and thresholds, and I will double-check for pitfalls and exceptions along the way.

> Let me first confirm the basics: RDW reflects anisocytosis, the heterogeneity of red cell size, and it rises when there is asynchronous erythropoiesis, nutritional deficiency, hemolysis, or ineffective erythropoiesis. Importantly, RDW can increase even when MCV is normal, so a normal MCV does not exclude pathology [^1cd238c5] [^3d748fae].

> Wait, let me verify the implication of a normal reticulocyte count. A normal reticulocyte count in the face of anemia or a high RDW suggests an inappropriately blunted marrow response, pointing toward nutritional deficiency, inflammation-driven iron sequestration, or ineffective erythropoiesis rather than hemolysis or acute blood loss, where reticulocytosis would be expected [^14f6dc31] [^a0d254df].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should integrate the two findings: high RDW with a normal reticulocyte count most often signals early or mixed nutritional deficiency (iron, B12, folate), anemia of chronic disease with functional iron restriction, or ineffective erythropoiesis such as myelodysplastic syndrome, and it can also be an early marker of systemic inflammation or oxidative stress even before anemia declares itself [^1cd238c5] [^3d748fae] [^87140cef].

> I need to check the prognostic dimension. Elevated RDW correlates with worse outcomes across many conditions independent of hemoglobin, including cardiovascular disease, CKD, community-acquired pneumonia, sepsis, and COVID-19, and in heart failure cohorts, both baseline RDW and rising RDW track higher mortality even after adjustment, so a high RDW with a normal reticulocyte count may flag occult disease burden or physiologic stress even when the CBC looks "otherwise normal" [^33541999] [^7ed56761] [^5b0571b6].

> Let me consider the mechanism more carefully. Inflammation and cytokines impair erythropoietin effect, blunt marrow response, and alter iron trafficking, producing anisocytosis without a compensatory reticulocytosis; oxidative stress and subtle shifts in RBC clearance kinetics can also widen the RBC volume distribution, explaining why RDW can rise before overt anemia or macrocytosis appear [^3d748fae] [^7dc68c75].

> Next, I should review a practical, stepwise workup. First, I will confirm the abnormality with a repeat CBC and smear to exclude spurious results and to look for microcytosis, macrocytosis, or dimorphism. Then, I should assess iron studies (ferritin, transferrin saturation, CRP) to distinguish iron deficiency from anemia of chronic disease, add B12 and folate to catch early deficiency, and consider reticulocyte indices or soluble transferrin receptor if available. If cytopenias or dysplasia are suspected, I should proceed to marrow evaluation for MDS, and if inflammation is suspected, I will correlate with ESR/CRP and evaluate for underlying inflammatory disease [^7ba7eb9b] [^b7602805] [^14f6dc31].

> But wait, what if the patient is not anemic at all? I should double-check that RDW can still be meaningful in nonanemic individuals. Indeed, population data show RDW predicts mortality even among nonanemic adults, so a high RDW with a normal reticulocyte count may still signal subclinical inflammation, early nutritional deficit, or marrow stress and warrants at least a focused review of systems, medication exposures, and risk factors rather than dismissal [^33541999] [^3d748fae].

> I will now examine special contexts where this pattern is particularly informative. In IBD, high RDW with a normal reticulocyte count is common and reflects mixed iron deficiency plus anemia of chronic disease. In heart failure and CKD, RDW tracks disease severity and mortality independent of hemoglobin. And in older adults, RDW tends to rise with age and chronic disease burden, so I should interpret values in age-appropriate context and consider longitudinal trends rather than a single value [^7ba7eb9b] [^50534230] [^4d9e713b].

> Hold on, I should verify thresholds and indices that refine diagnosis. RDW greater than about 14.5% is commonly used as "elevated" in adults, and pairing RDW with MCV helps distinguish microcytic from macrocytic processes. Reticulocyte hemoglobin content and the immature reticulocyte fraction can detect functional iron deficiency earlier than conventional indices, and the reticulocyte production index helps quantify whether the marrow response is appropriate for the degree of anemia, which is crucial when the raw reticulocyte count is "normal" but the anemia is significant [^7ba7eb9b] [^61245b85] [^14f6dc31].

> Let me reconsider the bottom line. High RDW with a normal reticulocyte count signifies heterogeneous erythropoiesis with an inadequate marrow response, most often due to early or mixed nutritional deficiency, inflammation-related iron restriction, or ineffective erythropoiesis, and it carries prognostic weight across multiple diseases. Therefore, I should not ignore it. Instead, I should confirm the result, layer in iron, B12, folate, and inflammatory markers, and escalate to marrow evaluation or disease-specific workup if cytopenias, dysplasia, or persistent unexplained elevation emerge [^3d748fae] [^7ba7eb9b] [^33541999].

---

High RDW with a normal reticulocyte count reflects **anisocytosis** from heterogeneous red cell size [^1cd238c5] due to **early or mixed nutritional deficiency** (iron, B12, folate), **chronic inflammation** (anemia of chronic disease), or **ineffective erythropoiesis** (myelodysplastic syndrome, congenital dyserythropoietic anemia) [^07dec496]. A normal reticulocyte count indicates the marrow is not yet mounting an adequate response, so this pattern is **not due to hemolysis or acute blood loss** [^14f6dc31]. Evaluate with iron studies, B12/folate, CRP/ESR, and consider marrow studies if cytopenias or dysplasia are present [^b7602805].

---

## Pathophysiological mechanisms

Several **pathophysiological mechanisms** can explain elevated RDW with a normal reticulocyte count:

- **Nutritional deficiencies**: Early iron, vitamin B12, or folate deficiency causes anisocytosis before a reticulocyte response emerges [^f2fbd075].

- **Chronic inflammation**: Cytokines impair erythropoiesis, causing heterogeneous RBC size with a blunted reticulocyte response [^7dc68c75].

- **Ineffective erythropoiesis**: Myelodysplastic syndromes and congenital dyserythropoietic anemias produce abnormal RBCs and anisocytosis without reticulocytosis [^07dec496].

- **Mixed anemia**: Combined deficiencies or deficiency plus chronic disease yield anisocytosis with a normal reticulocyte count [^14f6dc31].

## Clinical conditions associated with high RDW and normal reticulocyte count

| **Clinical condition** | **Mechanism** | **Key features** |
|-|-|-|
| Iron deficiency anemia (early) | Nutritional deficiency | - Microcytosis <br/> - Hypochromia <br/> - Elevated RDW <br/> - Normal reticulocytes early [^8351bcac] |
| Vitamin B12/folate deficiency (early) | Nutritional deficiency | - Macrocytosis <br/> - Elevated RDW <br/> - Normal reticulocytes early [^e9a35e57] |
| Anemia of chronic disease | Chronic inflammation | - Normocytic or mildly microcytic <br/> - Elevated RDW <br/> - Normal or low reticulocytes [^7ba7eb9b] |
| Myelodysplastic syndrome | Ineffective erythropoiesis | - Cytopenias <br/> - Dysplasia <br/> - Elevated RDW <br/> - Normal or low reticulocytes [^792cd167] |
| Congenital dyserythropoietic anemia | Ineffective erythropoiesis | - Macrocytosis <br/> - Elevated RDW <br/> - Reticulocytopenia [^07dec496] |
| Mixed anemia | Combined mechanisms | - Variable MCV <br/> - Elevated RDW <br/> - Normal reticulocytes [^14f6dc31] |

## Clinical implications and diagnostic approach

High RDW with a normal reticulocyte count is a **sensitive marker of early or mixed anemia**, chronic inflammation, or ineffective erythropoiesis. It is not due to hemolysis or acute blood loss, where reticulocytosis would be expected [^14f6dc31]. Clinically, it signals the need to:

- **Confirm anemia**: Check hemoglobin, hematocrit, and MCV to classify anemia [^14f6dc31].

- **Assess iron status**: Ferritin, transferrin saturation, CRP to distinguish iron deficiency from anemia of chronic disease [^b7602805].

- **Evaluate B12/folate**: Identify macrocytic deficiencies [^37f1cd81].

- **Look for inflammation**: CRP/ESR and clinical context [^f83acf0b].

- **Consider marrow disorders**: If cytopenias or dysplasia are present, pursue bone marrow studies [^792cd167].

---

## Prognostic significance

Elevated RDW independently predicts worse outcomes in multiple settings, including cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, and COVID-19, and is linked to inflammation, oxidative stress, and nutritional deficits [^33541999] [^7ed56761] [^3d748fae]. In these contexts, a normal reticulocyte count underscores a blunted marrow response and higher risk.

---

High RDW with a normal reticulocyte count reflects anisocytosis from heterogeneous RBC size due to early or mixed nutritional deficiency, chronic inflammation, or ineffective erythropoiesis, with a marrow response that is not yet adequate. This pattern is **not due to hemolysis or acute blood loss** and warrants a structured evaluation of iron, B12, folate, inflammation, and marrow function.

### The diagnostic red blood cell distribution width as a prognostic factor in acute myeloid leukemia [^3d748fae]. Blood Advances (2021). Medium credibility.

TO THE EDITOR:

The red blood cell distribution width (RDW) is a marker that describes the degree of heterogeneity of erythrocyte volume. Because it is part of the routine automated output of blood cell counters, the RDW is included in the diagnostic work-up of most hematologic diseases and is easily and inexpensively assessed. Red blood cells (RBCs) typically decrease in cellular volume across their lifespan, which is why a delayed clearance of older erythrocytes leads to higher RDW levels. Subsequently, a higher RDW mirrors a dysregulated erythrocyte homeostasis with either impaired erythropoiesis (including reticulocytosis and macrocytosis; eg, due to toxic effects) or abnormal (prolonged) RBC survival. Although, historically, the clinical meaning of the RDW was limited to the differential diagnosis of anemia, a wider applicability recently became evident. Increased RDW levels are associated with a higher mortality in healthy people, which has been linked to oxidative stress, poor nutritional status, and older age. Data also suggest that a high RDW defines a proinflammatory state, leading to a higher incidence of cardiovascular diseases, including heart failure, coronary heart disease, and cardiac mortality, as well as a greater likelihood of developing a variety of malignancies.

### An increase in red blood cell distribution width from baseline predicts mortality in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock [^cff8e00f]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

There are several limitations to our study. First, we arbitrarily determined 72 hours after ED admission as the second RDW measurement and defined an increase in RDW as ΔRDW 72hr-adm > 0.2%. Whether changes in RDW during the first 72 hours could represent the pathophysiologic changes and therapeutic responses in critically ill patients is not clear. Ku et al. suggested that 72-hour RDW after the onset of bacteremia could be a predictor of all-cause mortality in patients with Gram-negative bacteremia. Therefore, based on this previous study, we investigated the clinical outcomes of the patients with severe and/or septic shock stratified by the changes in RDW values between baseline and 72 hours after admission. Second, we did not investigate the use of erythropoietin, iron or vitamin B 12 deficiency, and reticulocyte count, which could have affected RDW values and, thus, might have limited the interpretation of study results. Third, the low number of patients in group 4 might introduce significant interference in the use of statistical models with numerous covariates. We examined two aspects of our models to assure the goodness of fit of our statistical models. For one thing, we conducted multivariate logistic regression analyses with the covariates used in Adjusted Model 2 and examined the results of the Hosmer-Lemeshow tests. Therefore, we confirmed that the P values for 28-day and 90-day mortality were 0.913 and 0.769, respectively, which demonstrated that these statistical analyses with numerous variables were acceptable. Next, we examined the proportional hazards assumption of the four groups, stratified by baseline RDW value and ΔRDW 72hr-adm, through log-minus-log-survival plot, and the parallel lines of the log-minus-log function were verified. Taken together, we suggested that these statistical analyses were tolerable, even though the number of patients in group 4 was relatively small. Furthermore, we analyzed the data with a simplified grouping in the same frame of statistical models. Patients were categorized into four groups based on whether RDW level was within the normal range or increased at baseline and at 72 hours. Group 1 was defined as patients with normal RDW at both time points, group 2 as patients with increased RDW at baseline and normal RDW at 72 hours, group 3 as patients with normal RDW and increased RDW at 72 hours, and group 4 as patients with increased RDW at both time points. In the results, we found that an increase in RDW from baseline was significantly associated with mortality. Moreover, group 4 in this subanalysis exhibited the highest 28-day and 90-day mortality rates similar to our outcomes (See Additional files 1 and 2). Finally, the sample size and the number of events were not large enough to establish statistical significance of increased risk among categorized groups. Therefore, a larger multicenter study with repeated RDW measurements is necessary to further clarify the predictive value of changes in RDW.

### Red blood cell distribution width and mortality risk in hospitalized adults with SARS-CoV-2 infection… [^cddea7e6]. JAMA Network (2020). Excellent credibility.

A, Stratifying patients based on admission RDW and mortality reveals that, among patients with an RDW of 14. 5% or less at admission, those who do not survive have an average RDW increase of

1. 5% during their first week of hospitalization, a significantly larger RDW increase than in all other groups. Meaning The findings suggest that an elevated RDW measured at admission and increasing RDW during hospitalization were associated with significantly higher mortality risk for patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection; RDW may be helpful for patient risk stratification. Importance Coronavirus disease 2019 is an acute respiratory illness with a high rate of hospitalization and mortality. Biomarkers are urgently needed for patient risk stratification. Red blood cell distribution width, a component of complete blood counts that reflects cellular volume variation, has been shown to be associated with elevated risk for morbidity and mortality in a wide range of diseases.

RDW is the coefficient of variation in RBC volume, or the SD divided by the mean. An increase in RDW must therefore correspond to a decrease in mean RBC volume, an increase in RBC volume variance, or both. Previous studies6, 8, 17, 19 have found evidence in some specific conditions that RDW elevation is caused by delayed clearance of older RBCs. Patients whose RDW was greater than 14. 5% at admission for a COVID-19 diagnosis had a mortality risk of 31%, whereas those with an RDW of
14. 5% or less had a mortality risk of 11%. The RR of mortality for those with an elevated RDW was 2.
73. Figure 3 shows that the mean RDW in the elevated group is
16. 4 compared with 13. 0 in the nonelevated group. In general, a 1. 25-fold higher RDW reflects a

1. 25-fold smaller MCV, a 1. 25-fold larger SD of the RBC volume distribution, or a combination of smaller changes to both. The average MCV differed by a factor of only about 1.
01. Although the true baseline RDW for the elevated RDW group is unknown, these results suggest that the major contributor to elevated RDW is an increase in variance of the RBC volume distribution instead of a decrease in MCV.

Conclusions

In young patients with CAP, elevated RDW levels are associated with significant higher rates of mortality and severe morbidity. RDW as a prognostic marker was unrelated with hemoglobin levels on admission.

Table 2
Published studies/clinical trials evaluating the role of red cell distribution width as a marker of activity in inflammatory bowel diseases

The first study published in 2008 by Molnar et al was a retrospective study, complementary to that of Clarke et al, that aimed to highlight any relation between RDW and disease activity. The investigators intended to clarify whether its quantitative fluctuations could be correlated with laboratory markers of inflammation and/or clinical indices of activity. They also tried to evaluate the potential of RDW to differentiate CD from UC in both the active state and remission. Mean values of RDW were significantly elevated in the active form of both CD and UC and also in inactive CD cases compared to the normal values of RDW (RDW 11–14%). The authors concluded that RDW could be used as an additional marker able to express active disease, based on the fact that its value was remarkably related to clinical activity indices.

Cakal et al performed a cross-sectional study with primary outcome the evaluation of RDW's potential in the assessment of active disease in IBD patients. In patients with active disease, laboratory indices (RDW, fibrinogen, CRP, ESR, and platelet [PLT] counts) had significantly higher values compared to those with inactive disease and controls (P < 0.05). RDW was the most sensitive and specific parameter indicating active disease in patients with UC. In CD patients, CRP at a cutoff of 0.54 mg/dL was the most accurate parameter in the diagnosis of active disease: sensitivity 92%, specificity 63% (area under the curve 0.92, P = 0.001).

Oustamanolakis et al performed a cross-sectional study to investigate the usefulness of RBC and reticulocyte indices in the evaluation of anemia in IBD patients. Activity was evaluated using the Crohn's disease activity index along with the Simple Clinical Colitis Activity Index (SCCAI) and CRP. The study's results showed that RDW behaved as an accurate diagnostic marker of IDA. Despite the observation that RDW was elevated in the IBD group compared to healthy controls, there were no significant discrepancies between active and inactive disease, while no important correlation with CRP was found.

### Association of red blood cell distribution width with mortality risk in hospitalized adults with SARS-CoV-2 infection [^7ed56761]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Importance

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an acute respiratory illness with a high rate of hospitalization and mortality. Biomarkers are urgently needed for patient risk stratification. Red blood cell distribution width (RDW), a component of complete blood counts that reflects cellular volume variation, has been shown to be associated with elevated risk for morbidity and mortality in a wide range of diseases.

Objective

To investigate whether an association between mortality risk and elevated RDW at hospital admission and during hospitalization exists in patients with COVID-19.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cohort study included adults diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection and admitted to 1 of 4 hospitals in the Boston, Massachusetts area (Massachusetts General Hospital, Brigham and Women's Hospital, North Shore Medical Center, and Newton-Wellesley Hospital) between March 4, 2020, and April 28, 2020.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The main outcome was patient survival during hospitalization. Measures included RDW at admission and during hospitalization, with an elevated RDW defined as greater than 14.5%. Relative risk (RR) of mortality was estimated by dividing the mortality of those with an elevated RDW by the mortality of those without an elevated RDW. Mortality hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs were estimated using a Cox proportional hazards model.

Results

A total of 1641 patients were included in the study (mean [SD] age, 62[18] years; 886 men [54%]; 740 White individuals [45%] and 497 Hispanic individuals [30%]; 276 nonsurvivors [17%]). Elevated RDW (> 14.5%) was associated with an increased mortality risk in patients of all ages. The RR for the entire cohort was 2.73, with a mortality rate of 11% in patients with normal RDW (1173) and 31% in those with an elevated RDW (468). The RR in patients younger than 50 years was 5.25 (normal RDW, 1% [n = 341]; elevated RDW, 8% [n = 65]); 2.90 in the 50- to 59-year age group (normal RDW, 8% [n = 256]; elevated RDW, 24% [n = 63]); 3.96 in the 60- to 69-year age group (normal RDW, 8% [n = 226]; elevated RDW, 30% [104]); 1.45 in the 70- to 79-year age group (normal RDW, 23% [n = 182]; elevated RDW, 33% [n = 113]); and 1.59 in those ≥ 80 years (normal RDW, 29% [n = 168]; elevated RDW, 46% [n = 123]). RDW was associated with mortality risk in Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for age, D-dimer (dimerized plasmin fragment D) level, absolute lymphocyte count, and common comorbidities such as diabetes and hypertension (hazard ratio of 1.09 per 0.5% RDW increase and 2.01 for an RDW > 14.5% vs ≤ 14.5%; P < .001). Patients whose RDW increased during hospitalization had higher mortality compared with those whose RDW did not change; for those with normal RDW, mortality increased from 6% to 24%, and for those with an elevated RDW at admission, mortality increased from 22% to 40%.

Conclusions and Relevance

Elevated RDW at the time of hospital admission and an increase in RDW during hospitalization were associated with increased mortality risk for patients with COVID-19 who received treatment at 4 hospitals in a large academic medical center network.

### Elevated red cell distribution width predicts poor outcome in young patients with community acquired pneumonia [^4ef316b7]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Key messages

- Elevated RDW on admission is a recently described risk factor for adverse outcome in cardiac problems.

- This study demonstrates that elevated RDW in young patients hospitalized with CAP is a significant risk factor for complicated hospitalization and in-hospital mortality.

- Conceivably, measuring RDW in the emergency department might offer the clinician a simple yet powerful tool in the process of decision making whether to admit patients with CAP.

The association of RDW and complicated hospitalization

Ninety five (55.6%) patients with complicated hospitalization had increased RDW as compared with 123 (26%) patients with uncomplicated admissions (P < 0.0001).

Complicated hospitalization and mortality rates were significantly higher among patients with increased RDW regardless of the WBC count (Figure 1); the complicated hospitalization rate was 15.7% in patients with normal RDW and WBC and 20.3% in patients with only abnormal WBC count, as compared with 33.3% in patients with elevated RDW alone (P = 0.001) and 51.2% in patients with combined abnormal leukocyte count and increased RDW (P < 0.001). As shown in Figure 1, the 90-day mortality was higher in patients with elevated RDW regardless of the WBC count; however, once again the combination of abnormal WBC and elevated RDW was significantly associated with the highest mortality rates.

In order to rule out the possibility that RDW effect on severe morbidity and mortality was unrelated to anemia, we compared complicated hospitalization in patients with hemoglobin (Hb) levels less than 110 g/L and higher levels of Hb. The two groups were examined in patients with normal and elevated RDW. As depicted in Figure 2, patients with normal RDW had no difference in severe morbidity or mortality regardless of Hb levels. On the other hand, elevated RDW was associated with a significant increase in both complicated hospitalization and 90-day mortality rates irrespective of Hb levels.

### Red cell distribution width as a new prognostic biomarker in refractory chronic graft – host disease [^eaa7a00b]. Haematologica (2024). Medium credibility.

Table 1.
Cox proportional hazards model for overall survival.

The association of RDW ≥ 13.4% with acute-phase proteins such as C-reactive protein (CRP) in the univariate analysis, and increased ANC in the multivariable regression analysis, suggests that inflammation may be a contributor to RDW elevation and the associated reduction in Hb. While hypoalbuminemia can also result from malnutrition and renal or hepatic disease, the drop in albumin concentration and association with worse OS is likely due to chronic inflammation from cGvHD, which was independent of moderate or severe renal function impairment. Albumin production by hepatocytes is known to be inhibited by proinflammatory cytokinesand appears to be a more reliable marker of chronic systemic inflammation in cGvHD patients compared to CRP, which could be more rapidly influenced by transient infections.

The association of RDW ≥ 13.4% with mTOR inhibitor therapy cannot be explained by a direct side-effect of this class of drugs. Contrary to expectations, a placebo-controlled randomized trial involving 25 healthy older adults (age 70–95 years) observed a decrease in RDW during sirolimus treatment. This suggests that the association may be attributed to higher cGvHD activity, necessitating treatment with these agents.

The association of RDW ≥ 13.4% with elevated LDH in multiple regression analysis is unclear. LDH elevation at this stage after HCT is rarely explained by relapsing disease. Possible causes include inflammation, disturbed erythropoiesis, tissue damage from cGvHD, drugs, and subclinical transplant-associated thrombotic microangiopathy or hemolytic anemia. Patients in this population infrequently require transfusions but no systematic information regarding transfusion support was available.

The cross-sectional design of the study does not allow us to assess changes in the measured variables over time. Survivorship bias might have affected the biomarker cutoff values because patients with extreme values could have died before enrollment in this trial. The identified biomarker thresholds should be interpreted in the context of the severely affected cGvHD population included in this study. Further studies, ideally clinical trials, are required to replicate these observations and confirm the prognostic validity of the RDW. These findings, however, strongly support the conclusion that RDW values beyond the normal range are associated with an unfavorable outcome.

RDW in IBD

There are different proposed mechanisms that attempt to explain why RDW is elevated in active IBD and how this is correlated with disease activity. The most probable encountered etiologies involve anemia, and especially iron deficiency anemia (IDA), as well as the impact of inflammation and oxidative stress on the normal process of erythropoiesis.

Anemia in IBD seems to be multifactorial, with an estimated prevalence between 9–74%, while IDA represents the commonest type. Causes implicated include continuous microscopic or macroscopic blood loss from the ulcerated intestinal mucosa, nutritional deficits of vitamins and minerals (iron, folate, B12) due to decreased intake or absorption, effects of medication, and inflammatory insults in the process of hematopoiesis. The RDW value is directly affected and subsequently elevated in IDA, as well as in situations of B12 and folate deprivation, while it is known that the degree and severity of anemia in both Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are linked to disease activity.

IBD are chronic and relapsing inflammatory conditions of the gastrointestinal tract. Chronic inflammation through the exertional effect of cytokines — interleukin-1, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-α, interferon-γ — may cause impaired erythropoietin (EPO) production, alterations of red blood cell life span, diminished responsiveness of bone marrow to EPO and impaired iron metabolism, disrupting the normal process of hematopoiesis. Data from the international literature suggest that anemia in IBD is multifactorial and is considered to be a combination of IDA and anemia of chronic disease (ACD), caused by a series of negative effects of an activated immune system at different levels of erythropoiesis.

The presence of RBC populations with marked heterogeneity in size, as a result of anemia and deficient erythropoiesis due to direct and indirect effects of inflammation and oxidative stress, seems to be an attractive hypothesis that can possibly explain the correlation of RDW with disease activity. The international literature contains a rather small number of publications that aimed to investigate RDW as an index of activity in IBD, or its correlation with clinical and laboratory markers used to express active disease (Table 2).

Clinical utility of RDW

RDW, a parameter measured automatically in every complete blood count (CBC), is an actual reflection of RBC size variability and heterogeneity. RDW is considered as a reliable index of the anisocytosis of the RBC population circulating in peripheral blood. There are 2 different ways to express RDW statistically: as a coefficient of variation (RDW-CV) and/or a standard deviation (RDW-SD). RDW-SD (expressed in fL) is an actual evaluation of the width of the RBC size distribution histogram and is quantified after determination of the width (in fL) at the 20% height level of that histogram. This index is therefore not influenced by the average size of the RBC population, the mean corpuscular volume (MCV).

On the other hand, RDW-CV (expressed in %) is derived from a mathematical formula that includes SD and MCV:

RDW-CV (%) = 1 standard deviation of RBC volume / MCV × 100% and it is affected by variations in RBC size. Anemias were traditionally classified, according to their MCV value, as microcytic (MCV below the reference range), normocytic (MCV within the reference range) and macrocytic (MCV above the reference range). In the early 80s a different approach was proposed for anemia classification using both RDW and MCV.

Based on this classification, 2 distinct entities of anemias were described: one with a homogeneous erythrocyte population and normal RDW, and a second with a heterogeneous erythrocyte population and a greater RDW. The main conditions that influence and elevate RDW value include anemias due to nutritional deficiencies (iron, B12 and folate), hemoglobinopathies, hemolytic anemias, and sickle-cell anemia (Table 1).

Table 1
Conditions that elevate red cell distribution width

Apart from its usual application as a hematologic parameter, RDW has been extensively studied as an inflammatory marker, along with its capability to express the activity and severity of various disease states and conditions. Probably the first recorded strong correlation of RDW with laboratory indices of inflammation, such as C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), came after a retrospective study of 3845 outpatient adults performed by Lippi et al.

Cardiovascular diseases, malignancy, chronic lower respiratory diseases, metabolic syndrome, chronic kidney disease and autoimmune disorders belong to a group of disorders where inflammation and oxidative stress comprise the major pathophysiologic insults. Data from the international literature showed that in these clinical entities, an elevated RDW value was related to an increased risk of morbidity and mortality and could be used as a predictor of an unfavorable disease course.

Despite the encouraging data concerning its potential as a prognostic marker of morbidity, mortality and unfavorable disease course in various pathologic conditions, in everyday clinical practice RDW remains a parameter used to define and differentiate anemias.

### Elevated red cell distribution width predicts poor outcome in young patients with community acquired pneumonia [^a7bec852]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Discussion

This study shows that in young patients with CAP, elevated RDW levels on admission either alone or in combination with abnormal levels of WBC are associated with significant higher rates of mortality and complicated hospitalization. RDW level as a prognostic marker was unrelated to hemoglobin levels on admission.

RDW is a simple laboratory test used to evaluate variance in the size and form of red blood cells. It is an important marker in the differential diagnosis of anemia. However, RDW was shown to be a predictor of severe morbidity and mortality in several cardiac problems. There is a large body of evidence showing that RDW is a strong predictor for an adverse outcome in these conditions, equivalent to other known markers, such as low ejection fraction, high New York Heart Association Functional Classification (NYHA) score and elevated serum B-Type Natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels. Moreover, it was recently reported that RDW is a strong predictor of mortality in several other conditions such as obesity, malignancies, and chronic kidney disease. Concordant with our findings, Wang et al. reported recently that a graded independent relation between higher RDW and adverse outcomes in ICU patients.

### The application value of mean red blood cell volume and red blood cell volume distribution width combined with total serum bilirubin in the early screening of neonatal hemolytic disease [^9b94a211]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

In the study, it was also found that in the group with MCV > 96.35fL or RDW-CV > 16.05%, the probability of anemia in children was higher (20.3%vs36.5%, 22.0%vs36.5%, respectively). A few children underwent emergency blood transfusion to treat anemia symptoms, and then samples were taken for three hemolysis experiments. This will affect the results of the experiments due to the consumption of blood group antibodies, which may cause missed HDN detection. There are not many of such cases in this study, and there is still a lack of sufficient observation with regards to this. We can pay more attention to the dual role of MCV and RDW-CV in blood transfusion guidance and HDN screening in such children. Additionally, the reticulocyte count often rises in hemolytic conditions. Reticulocytes are larger than mature RBC, thereby elevating the MCV, and the mixture of reticulocytes with mature RBC elevates the RDW. Therefore, reticulocytosis should continue to be observed as the underlying mechanism for the observed MCV and RDW elevations. This study did not include cases diagnosed with suspected HDN and those with multiple causes of jaundice, such as HDN with premature delivery, infection, G6PD deficiency, etc. Thus, this study can continue to expand the data used to improve the comparison.

### Utility of red cell distribution width in screening for iron deficiency [^e6b1b0d9]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2013). Low credibility.

Aims

To assess the sensitivity of an adult-derived red cell distribution width (RDW) reference limit in the detection of iron deficiency in young children.

Methods

Haematological analysis performed on a cohort of 13-month-old healthy term infants of North European ancestry.

Results

21/98 infants were iron-deficient (> 2.5% hypochromic red cells). Of the remaining 77, 35 with RDW > 13.9% also had evidence of incipient iron deficiency on the basis of significantly lower haemoglobin (11.5 vs 11.8 g/dl, p = 0.046), mean cell volume (75.6 vs 77.8 fl, p = 0.002) and mean cell haemoglobin (25.4 vs 26.2 pg, p = 0.002) values and higher zinc protoporphyrin (55 vs 44 μmol/molhaem, p < 0.001) values than those of the 42 with RDW ≤ 13.9%.

Conclusions

An adult-derived RDW reference limit has utility in screening for iron deficiency at the age of 13 months. The incidence of non-anaemic iron deficiency in this group was 52.8%.

### Red cell distribution width associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes in patients with chronic kidney disease [^9235f69a]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

The association between RDW and mortality was linear and consistent across various RDW levels, ranging from the normal reference level to RDW ≥ 17.5%. We demonstrate the prognostic significance of RDW in this study. Because biomarkers of oxidative stress and inflammation such as myeloperoxidase, IL-6, and interferon-γ are not routinely available in general practice, RDW might be a cost-effective tool for physicians for identifying populations at high CV risks. However, similar to other markers of infection or inflammation, RDW is not specific for a particular disease. Therefore, the feasibility of its use in clinical applications remains unclear.

Some limitations of our study must be discussed. First, because we retrospectively analyzed our study cohort, we could determine only the association between increased RDW and CV outcomes but not the causality. Second, the study was conducted at a single center and included a relatively small number of patients; hence, our sample might not reflect the entire cohort. Third, although we controlled for several variables influencing RDW, there might be relevant confounders that we were unable to completely adjust. A well-designed prospective study with a larger cohort may be performed to verify our results.

### Elevated red cell distribution width predicts poor outcome in young patients with community acquired pneumonia [^2c97746a]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Several explanations were suggested to this surprising finding. Abnormal RDW usually suggests one or more chronic condition that accompanies significant heart failure, such as anemia or nutritional deficit. Another mechanism that was suggested is the release of cytokines in response to inflammatory stress. These cytokines block the activity of erythropoietin and cause production of ineffective red blood cell and elevated RDW. Lippi et al found a correlation between high RDW and elevated indexes of inflammation, such as elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP). This correlation was independent of concomitant diseases, and was demonstrated even when anemic patients were excluded from the statistical analysis.

Our data demonstrated that RDW is a valuable and sensitive marker for a high level of inflammatory activity in young patients with CAP, and it is independent of hemoglobin levels. The mechanism underlying the association between high levels of RDW and adverse outcome in patients hospitalized with pneumonia is unknown. RDW is elevated in conditions in which there is ineffective red cell production or increased destruction of red blood cell. RDW may indicate a severe inflammatory process, with impact on bone marrow function and iron metabolism. Another option is that RDW is an earlier marker of prognosis, and it may appear earlier in the complex process of anemia than low levels of hemoglobin. As noted before, high RDW levels may represent a culmination of multiple pathophysiologic processes occurring in acute inflammatory and infectious state.

### Back to basics: red blood cell distribution width: clinical use beyond hematology… [^ed77c24d]. publications.aap.org (2025). Medium credibility.

The complete blood cell count is a widely available and commonly used inexpensive laboratory test used in clinical practice. Information contained therein includes the white blood cell count and differential count, red blood cell count, RBC indices, hemoglobin level, hematocrit concentration, and platelet count. The RBC indices include the mean cell volume, mean cell hemoglobin, mean cell hemoglobin concentration, and RBC distribution width. Traditionally, the clinical use of RDW has been limited to helping differentiate certain types of anemias. During the past decade, this quick and inexpensive test has been the subject of several studies attempting to evaluate its use as, among other things, an inflammatory marker, (.

### Usefulness of red cell width distribution (RDW) in the assessment of children with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) [^97447d64]. Pediatric Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

RDW is one of the parameters in complete blood count (CBC) that measures variation in red blood cell size or volume (anisocytosis). The most common cause of an elevated RDW is anemia [evaluated in association with mean corpuscular volume (MCV) in differential diagnosis]. Regardless of that higher than normal RDW has also been described as a risk factor for unfavourable clinical course in various diseases in children. RDW is known to be a prognostic marker in adult with pulmonary hypertension. The value of this test in the PAH pediatric population was not yet established. The aim of the study was to evaluate the prognostic value of RDW in children with PAH and utility of this parameter in management.

### The red cell distribution width as a prognostic indicator in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis [^75d1c8e4]. Chest (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The course of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is characterized by variable patterns of disease progression. The red cell distribution width (RDW) is a parameter that is routinely reported with all CBC counts. We sought to test the prognostic usefulness of this parameter in a well-defined cohort of patients with IPF.

Methods

CBCs, demographics, and pulmonary function data from patients with IPF evaluated between January 1997 and June 2011 were collated. Patient outcomes were ascertained from the program's database and the Social Security Death Index.

Results

There were 319 patients with IPF evaluated in whom baseline CBCs were available. The range in the RDW was 11.9 to 21.9 (median 14.1). There were 228 subjects with RDW values ≤ 15 (normal) and 91 patients with RDW values > 15. Patients with normal RDW values had a median survival of 43.1 months compared with 16.3 months for those whose RDW was > 15 (P = 0.001). There were 198 patients with available serial RDW data. Those patients who had a change in the RDW of less or greater than +0.010/mo had median survivals of 43.0 and 23.9 months, respectively (P = 0.0246).

Conclusions

The RDW is a readily available laboratory test result that may provide important, independent prognostic information at baseline and follow-up in patients with IPF. Further studies are warranted to validate this as a biomarker for IPF outcomes, as well as to define the biologic basis for this association.

### Practical guidance for the management of iron deficiency in patients with inflammatory bowel disease [^14f6dc31]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Complete blood cell count

A CBC for diagnostic evaluation of anemia should include the following cell indices: red blood cell count (RBC), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), reticulocytes count/production index, red cell distribution width (RDW), thrombocyte count and leucocyte count. In order to differentiate between various forms of anemia, the first step is to look at the MCV and MCH to identify macrocytic/normocytic/microcytic anemia. The next step is to evaluate the reticulocyte count and to differentiate between appropriate and inappropriate erythropoiesis. The morphology of red blood cells and the reticulocyte count can help to identify the various causes of anemia, as shown in Table 2.

Table 2.
Causes of anemia and influence on red blood cell morphology and reticulocyte count.

In clinical practice, it has to be considered that multiple causes of anemia can be present in one patient. For example, coexisting IDA and ACD can be microcytic or normocytic. In IDA with concurrent drug-induced anemia (e.g. in the case of treatment with azathioprine), the lab test can be microcytic or even show a macrocytic anemia. This shows that the presence of macrocytic anemia alone should not be mistaken as a reason to exclude iron deficiency. MCH and MCHC are usually decreased in iron deficiency anemia, but are usually normal in ACD.

The RDW shows how much the erythrocytes differentiate in their size. It is commonly increased in IDA and within normal range in thalassemia. However, in patients with IBD, it has to be considered that nutritional deficits and disease activity can also increase the RDW.

Reticulocyte count is reduced (or 'normal', although it should physiologically be upregulated in anemia) in iron deficiency as a sign of inappropriate erythropoiesis. If the reticulocyte count is increased, hemolysis is an important differential diagnosis (lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), bilirubin and haptoglobine are parameters that help to further investigate the presence of hemolysis). The reticulocyte production index (RPI) puts the reticulocyte count in relation to the severity of anemia (RPI = reticulocyte count in % × hematocrit of the patient/ideal hematocrit (= 0.45) × reticulocyte maturation time). As a result of the shorter half-life, reticulocyte indices can reflect changes in the iron homeostasis within 3–10 days, much faster than erythrocyte indices.

### Efficiency of red cell distribution width in identification of children aged 1–3 years with iron deficiency anemia against traditional hematological markers [^2f6ca6c8]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusions

In conclusion, RDW > 15% and hemoglobin ≤ 10.0 g/dL measured using a simple coulter can be used as a valuable screening tool for identifying children with iron deficiency anemia in a low socio-economic setting. Although it needs to be further investigated in other populations, there is no reason to believe that results will vary from the present study. If these findings are confirmed in other settings as well, it offers a very useful tool for screening iron deficient anemic children without need for more expensive iron status marker investigations.

### Elevated red cell distribution width predicts poor outcome in young patients with community acquired pneumonia [^a0d254df]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Laboratory variables on admission

Serum glucose, creatinine, sodium, hemoglobin, WBC, RDW and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) were measured on admission.

Hemoglobin levels, mean corpuscular volume and RDW were measured on admission and prior to hospital discharge, using the Advia 120 Hematology Analyzer (Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics Deerfield, Illinois, USA). Glucose, BUN and creatinine levels were measured using the "Dimension" (Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics Deerfield, Illinois, USA).

RDW is reported as coefficient of variation (in percent) of red blood cell volume. The normal range for RDW in our laboratory is 11.5 to 14.5%. The correctness of this normal range was confirmed by analyzing RDW data in 17,293 ambulatory subjects who attended the Rambam Center for Preventive Medicine for a medical examination and health counseling. In this group, mean RDW was 13.1% (median 13.0%) with 95% confidence interval (CI) of RDW of 12.0 to 14.4%.

### Multiplicative interaction between mean corpuscular volume and red cell distribution width in predicting mortality of elderly patients with and without anemia [^f04b9eab]. American Journal of Hematology (2013). Low credibility.

Recent studies have shown that an elevated red cell distribution width (RDW) is an important predictor of adverse outcomes. However, the strength of this biomarker has not been tested in a large outpatient elderly population. Also since increased RDW can be due to a variety of etiologies, additional biomarkers are needed to refine the prognostic value of this variable. We assembled a cohort of 36,226 elderly (≥ 65yo) patients seen at an outpatient facility within the Einstein/Montefiore system from January 1st 1997 to May 1st 2008 who also had a complete blood count performed within 3 months of the initial visit. With a maximum follow-up of 10 years, we found that an elevated RDW (> 16.6) was associated with increased risk of mortality in both non-anemic (HR = 3.66, p < 0.05) and anemic patients (HR = 1.87, p < 0.05). The effect of RDW on mortality is significantly increased in non-anemic patients with macrocytosis (HR = 5.22, p < 0.05) compared to those with normocytosis (HR = 3.86, p < 0.05) and microcytosis (HR = 2.46, p < 0.05). When comparing non-anemic patients with both an elevated RDW and macrocytosis to those with neither, we observed an elevated HR of 7.76 (higher than expected in an additive model). This multiplicative interaction was not observed in anemic patients (HR = 2.23). Lastly, we constructed Kaplan-Meier curves for each RDW/MCV subgroup and found worsened survival for those with macrocytosis and an elevated RDW in both anemia and non-anemic patients. Based on our results, the addition of MCV appears to improve the prognostic value of RDW as a predictor of overall survival in elderly patients.

### Increased red cell distribution width: a novel predictor of adverse outcome in patients hospitalized due to acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^ffa72fe7]. Respiratory Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Acute exacerbation of COPD (AECOPD) is one of the leading causes for hospitalization and readmission in developed countries. No laboratory indices were consistently found to be associated with readmission risk. Recent evidence attests that red blood cell distribution width (RDW), conveys important information for short and long term prognosis in a variety of medical conditions. Prognostic usefulness of RDW in patients with AECOPD has not been investigated.

Objective

To evaluate the usefulness of RDW in predicting early adverse outcomes in patients hospitalized due to AECOPD.

Methods

Patients hospitalized for AECOPD between 2011 and 2013 were revised. Clinical and laboratory parameters were noted. Participants were followed to determine the incidence of readmission due to AECOPD, readmission from any cause and composite end point of readmission or death during 60 days after discharge.

Results

539 patients were included in the study. The 60-day overall readmission rate was 26.35%, of that, 41.55% were due to AECOPD. The Presence of heart failure, pH below 7.35 at discharge and abnormal RDW were associated with the composite endpoint. The negative predictive value of normal RDW was 80.12%.

Conclusion

Increased RDW is an independent negative prognostic factor associated with adverse outcomes after hospitalization due to AECOPD.

### Association of red blood cell distribution width with mortality risk in hospitalized adults with SARS-CoV-2 infection [^9d25ca1e]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Other studies have noted the potential value of using RDW for a differential diagnosis of pneumonia, or as a marker of complication rates in SARS-CoV-2 infection, either directly or as a component of a machine learning framework. Recent small-scale studies have included RDW in multivariate models along with neutrophil-lymphocyte ratioor hemoglobinfor a differential diagnosis of COVID-19. The results of the present study show that the use of RDW as a univariate marker relative to its predetermined reference interval (≤ 14.5%) is associated with substantially increased mortality risk. We also found that RDW was associated with the highest risk ratio when considered in multivariate models with some other blood count measures (eTable 4 in the Supplement). The only other blood count measure studied with a statistically significant risk ratio was PLT count, and future investigation is warranted given the evidence of thrombotic complications within COVID-19 patients.

The specific mechanism or mechanisms for the RDW alteration associated with COVID-19 remain unclear. RDW is a nonspecific marker of general illness, and is therefore unlikely to be causally associated with COVID-19 disease progression. COVID-19 is associated with altered turnover in all WBC lineages, as noted previously, as well as with altered platelet dynamics in COVID-associated coagulopathy. The association of elevated RDW with COVID-19 severity could be consistent with previous reports (in non–COVID-19 cohorts), suggesting that RDW can become elevated when RBC production kinetics have slowed in the setting of increased WBC and platelet kinetics.

It is unknown whether patients admitted with an RDW greater than 14.5% had higher baseline RDW than those who were admitted with an RDW of 14.5% or less before SARS-CoV-2 infection. RDW usually changes slowly because it reflects the volume variance of a cell population that is turning over at a rate typically no larger than a 1% or 2% per day. The large increase in the elevated RDW group (> 3% shown in Figure 3 A) may suggest a longer duration of disease for these patients at the time of admission, but direct study of the earlier phases of the disease is required to know how quickly RDW may be evolving before hospitalization, and determination of time of initial infection was not possible within this study cohort.

Peripheral blood synoptic report elements — white blood cell (WBC) count, hemoglobin (Hgb), platelet (Plt) count, absolute neutrophil count, reticulocyte count, and red cell distribution width (RDW) — are linked to specific diseases with documented outcome differences, with studies reporting significant differences numbered as follows: WBC count in Ph+ ALL (1), Hgb in myelodysplasia and aplastic anemia (2), Plt in myelodysplasia, myeloproliferative disease, and adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (5), absolute neutrophil count in myelodysplasia (2), reticulocyte count in aplastic anemia (1), and RDW in aplastic anemia and myelodysplastic syndrome (1).

### Red cell distribution width and risk of coronary heart disease events [^53fc44b5]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2010). Low credibility.

Red cell distribution width (RDW) has emerged as a powerful predictor of all-cause mortality in variety of cardiovascular settings. However, no data are available associating RDW with coronary heart disease (CHD) risk in a healthy and nationally representative multiethnic population. A total of 7,556 participants of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys 1999 to 2006 (age 41.5 ± 15.8 years, 60% women) were divided into 3 categories according to their 10-year Framingham risk of hard CHD events: < 10% (n = 6,173, reference category), 10% to 20% (n = 1,093, intermediate-risk category), and > 20% (n = 290, high-risk category). Unadjusted and adjusted multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed evaluating RDW as a predictor of CHD risk. Each unit increase (0.1) in RDW posed a statistically significant greater odds of being in the intermediate-risk category (odds ratio -1.35, 95% confidence interval 1.27 to 1.45, p < 0.001) and high-risk category (odds ratio -1.38, 95% confidence interval 1.25 to 1.53, p < 0.001) compared to the reference category, after adjusting for race, body mass index, estimated glomerular filtration rate, hemoglobin A1c, C-reactive protein, hemoglobin, and mean corpuscular volume. Additional adjustments with serum iron, vitamin B(12), and folic acid levels did not affect the association. Subsequently, we divided participants into 2 categories according to their anemia status (as defined by the World Health Organization) to evaluate its effect. An RDW level greater than the seventy-fifth percentile in both anemic and nonanemic participants was a significant predictor of greater CHD risk while RDW of the seventy-fifth percentile or less in anemic participants failed to predict CHD (compared to nonanemic participants with similar RDW as the reference category). In conclusion, a higher RDW appears to be a powerful independent predictor of future CHD risk.

Table 5. Extended — hematologic parameters with prognostic or diagnostic value: In Ph+ pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), low-risk on d1 defined by peripheral blood WBC < 100 000 and bone marrow blast < 5% was associated with significantly better event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS), with EFS: 55% low risk, 18% high risk; OS: 79% low risk, 27% high risk. In myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), hemoglobin (Hgb) thresholds are prognostic, as Hgb > 10 g/dL is associated with better OS in Int-1 and Int-2 MDS, and in MDS, significantly different survival and evolution to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) was associated with Hgb < 10 g, platelet count (Plt) < 100 000, and absolute neutrophil count < 0.8. Baseline thrombocytopenia < 100 000 was associated with 39% transfusion independence versus 73% without thrombocytopenia, and the odds ratio for decreased cytogenetic response with, versus without, thrombocytopenia was 4.78. For differentiating aplastic anemia (AA) from hypoplastic MDS in adults, peripheral blood Plt, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), reticulocyte count, and percentage of lymphocytes are significantly different, and red cell distribution width (RDW) values differ with mean RDW, 16.8% severe AA; 17.4% nonsevere AA; versus 20.4% MDS.

### Red blood cell distribution width and ischaemic stroke [^8351bcac]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

The red blood cell distribution width (RDW) is a parameter that reflects the heterogeneity of the red blood cell volume. It is indicated that the variation coefficient of the red blood cell volume is more objective and accurate than that of the red blood cell on the blood smear. RDW is in about 11.0%–16.0% in normal population. RDW will rise under some physiological and pathological conditions.

RDW has at least five clinical significant meanings:
To diagnose and guide the treatment of iron deficiency anaemia. Traditionally, anaemia deficiency from iron can be differentiated from folate deficiency according to the size of RDW. RDW would increase because of the release of immature red blood cells into the blood stream in certain haematological diseases.RDW increases in iron deficiency anaemia, and such increase would appear earlier than the decline of mean corpuscular volume (MCV), which can be an early indication of iron deficiency. When MCV is low, RDW would increase more significantly. When iron therapy is given, RDW would elevate first and then gradually reduce at the normal level.
To diagnose small cell and low pigment anaemia.
To classify anaemia.
Previously, many research suggested that RDW was closely related to the mortality and cardiovascular events, such as acute coronary syndrome, ischaemic cerebrovascular disease, peripheral artery disease, heart failure (HF), atrial fibrillation (AF) and hypertension.
RDW can be made as a predictor of mortality in patients with cancer, chronic lung disease or acute renal failure.

Stroke is the result of cerebral vascular occlusion or haemorrhage, and it is the leading cause of death in the world. At present, clinical diagnosis relies on history, neurological examinations and neuro-imaging. Several scoring systems are used to quantify the degree of severity of stroke: the Glasgow Coma Scale, Canadian Neurological Scale, Scandinavian Stroke Scale and National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS). However, there is no biological surrogate marker to diagnose stroke. RDW by flow cytometry could be an option for this purpose and predict the occurrence of stroke.

### Anemia in children with inflammatory bowel disease: a position paper by the IBD committee of the north American society of pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology and nutrition [^7ba7eb9b]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2020). High credibility.

Screening tests and interpretation in IBD-related anemia specify that initially a complete blood count (CBC), CRP, and ferritin levels should be performed, and if anemic, testing should include CBC with differential, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular Hgb concentration (MCHC), red cell distribution width (RDW), reticulocyte count, CRP, serum ferritin, and transferrin saturation (TSAT); in IDA and FID anemia is more likely to be microcytic and hypochromic (low MCV and MCHC) whereas in ACD it is more likely normocytic and normochromic; macrocytosis may be seen with vitamin B12 or folic acid deficiency or drug therapy including sulfasalazine, methotrexate, 6-MP, and azathioprine; a high RDW in the presence of microcytosis suggests iron deficiency and has a high sensitivity of about 93% for the diagnosis of iron deficiency; the reticulocyte count is a useful marker of bone marrow response where a low count indicates suppression of erythropoiesis and a high initial count raises suspicion for hemolysis prompting further evaluation including a peripheral blood cell smear, serum haptoglobin, bilirubin, lactate dehydrogenase, and direct Coomb's test; if the platelet count is high, iron deficiency and/or inflammation is more likely.

### Low hemoglobin A (1c) in nondiabetic adults: an elevated risk state? [^8655f2de]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

Certain limitations should be considered in interpreting the results of this study. We were limited to information available from the death certificate for the classification of the underlying cause of death, which may have resulted in misclassification, particularly for the noncancer and noncardiovascular outcomes. We also did not have data available on iron indices, reticulocyte count, or red-cell distribution width. Nonetheless, the ARIC population is a large, diverse cohort with virtually complete follow-up for vital status and comprehensive information on important confounders and major risk factors for mortality. To our knowledge, this study is one of the first comprehensive examinations of the association of low HbA 1c with cause-specific mortality in a general population.

In conclusion, our results add to the evidence that low HbA 1c values may be a marker of elevated mortality risk in the general population. With new recommendations for the use of HbA 1c for diagnosis of diabetes, HbA 1c testing will undoubtedly increase. To the extent that HbA 1c is adopted for diabetes screening, clinicians will frequently observe HbA 1c values in the normal range, including low normal values. Additional work should focus on understanding the nonglycemic determinants of HbA 1c and the mechanisms that explain why low HbA 1c values in some individuals may reflect an elevated risk state.

### An increase in red blood cell distribution width from baseline predicts mortality in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock [^3335fa2b]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Interestingly, in multivariate analysis for 90-day mortality, a significantly higher mortality risk was observed in group 3 in which RDW increased within 72 hours after ED admission (normal RDW at baseline and ΔRDW 72hr-adm > 0.2%) compared to group 1, while there was an insignificant difference between group 1 and 3 in 28-day mortality. These findings demonstrate that the relationship between an increase in RDW and mortality may be more meaningful, when the follow-up duration is longer.

Although the mechanism underlying the association between higher RDW and mortality in septic patients is not yet completely understood, several plausible explanations have been suggested in previous studies. Systemic inflammation has been shown to predict progressive illness, cardiovascular mortality and death in ICU patients. Systemic inflammation response impacts bone marrow function and iron metabolism, and proinflammatory cytokines have been found to inhibit erythropoietin-induced erythrocyte maturation and proliferation, and to downregulate erythropoietin receptor expression, which are associated with RDW increases. Oxidative stress may also be a contributing factor of the association between RDW and mortality. High oxidative stress is present in sepsis through the generation of reactive oxygen species by activated leukocytes. Moreover, it has been proposed that oxidative stress induces an increase in RDW by reducing RBC survival and increasing the release of large premature RBCs into the peripheral circulation. Another explanation may be related to malnutrition. Nutritional markers, including total cholesterol and albumin, are believed to be significantly associated with RDW. In addition, RDW has also been noted to be associated with renal dysfunction, which is known to be closely related with inflammation and malnutrition. Recently, Veeranna et al. demonstrated the predictive ability of RDW for HbA1c in healthy nondiabetic adults, proposing the possibility of chronic hyperglycemia along with oxidative stress and inflammation as mediators of the association between RDW and adverse outcomes. All things considered, it is reasonable to assume that increased RDW may represent an integrative measure of the multiple harmful pathologic processes, including inflammation, oxidative stress, malnutrition, and renal dysfunction, that simultaneously occur in critical illness. Thus, with respect to the results of this study, we suggest that changes in RDW, especially increasing RDW, reflect the aggravation of inflammation, oxidative stress, nutritional deficiencies, and renal dysfunction, and that the combination of a baseline RDW value and an increase in RDW can be a promising independent prognostic marker in septic patients. However, inflammation, oxidative stress, nutritional deficiencies, and renal dysfunction may not entirely explain why increased RDW is associated with mortality and greater length of hospital stay, because these associations were still significant even after adjusting for total cholesterol, albumin, and SOFA score; therefore further study is needed to determine the mechanism for the association between RDW values and mortality.

### Elevated red cell distribution width predicts poor outcome in young patients with community acquired pneumonia [^ea17e138]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Multivariate analysis of 90-day mortality

All variables that were found to be associated (P < 0.1) with 90-day mortality in the univariate analysis (Table 5); were included in the initial multivariate prediction rule. As depicted in Table 6; in the first model that excluded RDW, variables that were associated with an increased risk of 90-day mortality included age 51 years or older, prior neurologic damage and immunosupression. Including RDW in the model demonstrated that the same variables in addition to elevated RDW were associated with increased 90-day mortality. Notably, the model that joined both elevated RDW and abnormal WBC; it was proved that this combination is significantly associated with increased mortality in addition to the three previous variables. The model with RDW improved AUC ROC as compared with a model without RDW from 0.807 (95% CI = 0.746–0.868) to 0.822 (95% CI = 0.766–0.879); while the model of combined elevated RDW and abnormal WBC improved AUC ROC from 0.807 to 0.828 (95% CI = 0.772–0.885). The Hosmer-Lemeshev goodness-of-fit statistic across decile of risk was not statistically significant, indicating little departure from a perfect fit in all three models.

### Red cell distribution width as a new prognostic biomarker in refractory chronic graft – host disease [^1e043a97]. Haematologica (2024). Medium credibility.

Median RDW of the total study cohort was 14.5% (IQR: 13.4–16.0%). In univariate Cox regression, RDW (%) displayed an association with survival as a continuous variable (Hazard Ratio [HR] = 1.09; 95%CI: 1.03–1.14; P = 0.004). However, we identified a clear split in survival curves between the first quartile (< 13.4%) and the remaining overlapping quartiles of RDW (Figure 1) distinguishing groups with statistically different OS (P = 0.0024, adjusted for 3 cut-points). The corresponding 5-year OS probabilities were 84.1% (95%CI: 75.3–89.9%) and 69.1% (95%CI: 63.6–74.0%) for patients with RDW < 13.4% and ≥ 13.4%, respectively. Information on the cause of death after excluding those with non-malignant reasons for transplant was available in 286 patients (Online Supplementary Figure S1). Patients with RDW ≥ 13.4% had a higher 5-year NRM of 20.8% (95%CI: 15.3–26.7%) compared to 7.6% (95%CI: 2.8–15.7%) among patients with RDW < 13.4% (P = 0.0082 for the full curves). The absolute difference in survival between the two RDW groups was similar to Karnofsky performance status (KPS) < 80% versus ≥ 80% and slightly lower than estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 45 versus ≥ 45 mL/min/1.73mbut not comparable to NIH lung score 3 versus 0–2, the latter representing the most serious risk factor for mortality in our cohort (Figure 1).

### Modulation of red blood cell population dynamics is a fundamental homeostatic response to disease [^031a2a5b]. American Journal of Hematology (2015). Low credibility.

Increased red blood cell (RBC) volume variation (RDW) has recently been shown to predict a wide range of mortality and morbidity: death due to cardiovascular disease, cancer, infection, renal disease, and more; complications in heart failure and coronary artery disease, advanced stage and worse prognosis in many cancers, poor outcomes in autoimmune disease, and many more. The mechanisms by which all of these diseases lead to increased RDW are unknown. Here we use a semi-mechanistic mathematical model of in vivo RBC population dynamics to dissect the factors controlling RDW and show that elevated RDW results largely from a slight reduction in the in vivo rate of RBC turnover. RBCs become smaller as they age, and a slight reduction in the rate of RBC turnover allows smaller cells to continue circulating, expanding the low-volume tail of the RBC population's volume distribution, and thereby increasing RDW. Our results show that mildly extended RBC lifespan is a previously unrecognized homeostatic adaptation common to a very wide range of pathologic states, likely compensating for subtle reductions in erythropoietic output. A mathematical model-based estimate of the clearance rate may provide a novel early-warning biomarker for a wide range of morbidity and mortality.

### Iron deficiency and red cell indices in patients with heart failure [^fcf2711c]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2018). Low credibility.

Aims

To investigate the prevalence of iron deficiency (ID) in heart failure (HF) patients with normal vs. abnormal red cell indices (RCI), the associations between iron parameters and RCI, and prognostic consequences of ID independently of RCI.

Methods and Results

We analysed clinical data of 1821 patients with HF [mean age 66 ± 13 years; 71% men; New York Heart Association class I/II/III/IV (11%/39%/44%/6%); left ventricular ejection fraction > 45%: 19%]. Iron deficiency (ferritin < 100 µg/L or ferritin 100–299 µg/L with transferrin saturation < 20%) was common irrespective of the presence of anaemia (haemoglobin < 12 g/dL in women and < 13 g/dL in men) or low RCI, from 75% in anaemic subjects with low mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular haemoglobin (MCH), and MCH concentration (MCHC), to 36% in non-anaemic subjects with MCV, MCH, and MCHC above the lower limit of normal. After adjustment for clinical variables, iron parameters remained independently associated with haemoglobin, MCV, MCH, MCHC, mean reticulocyte haemoglobin content (CHR), and red cell distribution width (RDW). In multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression models there was a trend towards higher mortality in patients with vs. without ID when adjusted for relevant HF prognosticators and MCH or MCHC (but not haemoglobin, CHR or RDW).

Conclusions

Patients with HF should be routinely screened for ID irrespective of the presence of anaemia or abnormal RCI. The detrimental impact of ID on long-term survival in HF is partially independent of RCI.

### Increased monocyte count and red cell distribution width as prognostic biomarkers in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis [^52802526]. Respiratory Research (2021). Medium credibility.

On the other hand, a causal-effect relationship between IPF and elevated RDW is highly unlikely. Instead, it is more likely that increased RDW is indicative of patients' hypoxemia and/or comorbidome in a similar way with other chronic lung diseases. It has been proposed that arterial hypoxemia leads to increased erythropoietin secretion and thus to increased RDW through mechanisms involving regulation of erythrocyte maturation and survival. Elevated RDW might have a role in the early identification of patients with IPF and intermittent hypoxemia. Patients with profound hypoxemia are easily diagnosed; intermittent hypoxemia might escape routine examination and there is still a need for biomarkers contributing to their identification.

Our study has some limitations. First of all, our study has the inherent weaknesses of a retrospective study. Nonetheless, the nature of this study enabled us to report longitudinal outcomes of patients with IPF. Secondly, our sample size is moderate compared to previous reports for the prognostic role of monocyte count; yet, the size is acceptable for a real-life study. Thirdly, we had data for LTOT, but not for po2 levels; thus, we could not further investigate the association of hypoxemia with monocyte count and RDW. Moreover, data for all-cause mortality was available; yet, the specific cause of death was not available for all patients. Finally, our results should be interpreted in the context of a real-life study that may be in part influenced by other factors including steroid use prior to admission at a referral center. To this end, multiple regression analysis was performed to adjust for these covariates.

### European consensus on the diagnosis and management of iron deficiency and anaemia in inflammatory bowel diseases [^b7602805]. Journal of Crohn's & Colitis (2015). Medium credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for iron deficiency anemia, more specifically with respect to patients with IBD, evaluation, ECCO 2015 guidelines recommend to obtain anemia workup (including at least RBC indices such as red cell distribution width and MCV, reticulocyte count, differential blood cell count, serum ferritin, transferrin saturation, and CRP concentration) if the hemoglobin is below normal. Include the following in a more extensive workup: serum concentrations of vitamin B12, folic acid, haptoglobin, the percentage of hypochromic red cells, reticulocyte hemoglobin, LDH, soluble transferrin receptor, creatinine, and urea.

### The clinical relevance of an isolated increase in the number of circulating hyperchromic red blood cells [^26233d72]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2002). Low credibility.

Aims

To search for laboratory evidence of hereditary spherocytosis (HS) among apparently healthy children with the chance finding of an isolated increase in hyperchromic red cells (cells with intracellular haemoglobin concentration > 410 g/litre).

Methods

Blood and reticulocyte counts and Pink tests were performed on successive children found on routine counts to have > 4% hyperchromic red cells, and compared with age and mean cell haemoglobin concentration (MCHC) matched controls and children known to have HS.

Results

Thirty four patients with > 4% hyperchromic red cells had significantly higher absolute numbers of such cells (p < 0.0001) and higher reticulocyte counts (p < 0.01) than age matched controls, together with higher MCHC (p < 0.0001) and haemoglobin distribution width (p < 0.0001) values and lower mean cell volume (p < 0.02) values. Significant differences were also found among hyperchromic red blood cell, reticulocyte, and haemoglobin distribution width values when subjects were compared with MCHC matched controls. Pink test values were higher in children with increased hyperchromic red blood cells, but not significantly so. In patients with HS, most variables measured were significantly different both from those of children with > 4% hyperchromic cells and controls. Despite the differences found, few MCHC, HDW, reticulocyte, or Pink test values were outside of the normal limits, and only one child with increased hyperchromic cells had both a mild reticulocytosis and a slightly raised Pink test value.

Conclusions

Subjects with an isolated increase in hyperchromic red blood cells have a profile of red blood cell changes similar to that of patients with HS, but to a lesser degree. They may carry a recessive form of the disease but lack the laboratory features of clinically manifest HS.

### Elevated red cell distribution width predicts poor outcome in young patients with community acquired pneumonia [^c11038c1]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

Community acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. While there is much data about risk factors for severe outcome in the general population, there is less focus on younger group of patients. Therefore, we aimed to detect simple prognostic factors for severe morbidity and mortality in young patients with CAP.

Methods

Patients of 60 years old or younger, who were diagnosed with CAP (defined as pneumonia identified 48 hours or less from hospitalization) between March 1, 2005 and December 31, 2008 were retrospectively analyzed for risk factors for complicated hospitalization and 90-day mortality.

Results

The cohort included 637 patients. 90-day mortality rate was 6.6% and the median length of stay was 5 days. In univariate analysis, male patients and those with co-morbid conditions tended to have complicated disease. In multivariate analysis, variables associated with complicated hospitalization included post chest radiation state, prior neurologic damage, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) > 10.7 mmol/L and red cell distribution width (RDW) > 14.5%; whereas, variables associated with an increased risk of 90-day mortality included age ≥ 51 years, prior neurologic damage, immunosuppression, and the combination of abnormal white blood cells (WBC) and elevated RDW. Complicated hospitalization and mortality rate were significantly higher among patients with increased RDW regardless of the white blood cell count. Elevated RDW was associated with a significant increase in complicated hospitalization and 90-day mortality rates irrespective to hemoglobin levels.

Conclusions

In young patients with CAP, elevated RDW levels are associated with significantly higher rates of mortality and severe morbidity. RDW as a prognostic marker was unrelated with hemoglobin levels.

### The role of red cell distribution width in the diagnosis of acute appendicitis: a retrospective case-controlled study [^bacf3434]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Acute appendicitis (AA) is the most common surgical abdominal emergency. Rapid diagnosis is important, because increased time between onset of symptoms and surgical intervention is associated with increased risk of appendiceal perforation and therefore potential peritonitis, sepsis, and death. However, the rate of negative appendectomy (when appendectomy is performed, but the appendix is found to be normal on histological evaluation) ranges from 5% to 42%, and this can be associated with considerable morbidity. Clinical diagnosis can be challenging, particularly in the early stages of appendicitis when clinical manifestations may be quite non-specific or atypical. Different elements of history, examination, and laboratory findings have varying predictive power in the diagnosis of appendicitis, and algorithms and scoring systems for clinical evaluation exist, but appendicitis can nevertheless be easily missed.

The preoperative laboratory tests can be performed easily in primary healthcare settings and often aid primary clinicians with decision making about patients with clinically suspected AA. Several parameters for the diagnosis of AA have been investigated in the literature. RDW, a measure of heterogeneity in the size of circulating red blood cells, is a component of the standard complete blood count and calculated as a percentage of the standard deviation of the red cell volume divided by the mean corpuscular volume. It has been reported that RDW level has clinical implications in various pathologies such as inflammatory bowel disease, celiac disease, pulmonary embolism, and coronary artery disease. In addition, its predictive role has been shown in inflammatory and infectious pathological diseases including acute pancreatitis, bacteremia, sepsis, and septic shock. In the present study we aimed to seek whether RDW level is important in the diagnosis of AA. No studies in literature have examined this subject before. In addition, it was aimed to show the relationship of RDW level with leukocyte count and CRP level.

### Efficiency of red cell distribution width in identification of children aged 1–3 years with iron deficiency anemia against traditional hematological markers [^5537cb91]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

The high incidence of IDA in children emphasizes the need for the cost effective and reliable tool in diagnosing IDA. A number of different indicators, such as hemoglobin, hematocrit, serum ferritin, transferrin saturation, erythropoietin, erythrocyte protoporphyrin, serum iron, mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration have been used to evaluate IDA. But the drawbacks of these tests are that many of them are expensive and require sophisticated laboratories, while others have been found to have a low specificity. It has been seen that anisocytosis occurs, where the erythrocytes produced are of smaller than average size and having a large size variation, due to inadequate iron supply. The morphology and function of erythrocytes at molecular level has been known to be disturbed due to iron deficiency anemia. Therefore, an increase in RDW values may occur in IDA allowing an early detection of ID before reduction in MCV occurs. RDW has been reported to have a high predictive value for IDA and can differentiate beta-thalassemia from other causes of anemia in populations. Our results corroborate the view that RDW evaluated in a large sample performed very well as a screening diagnostic test for identifying iron deficiency anemia. These findings are similar to the findings of earlier studies conducted in other settings and support the usage of RDW as a screening tool for identifying iron deficiency anemia.

### Red cell distribution width associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes in patients with chronic kidney disease [^40cf517b]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Red cell distribution width (RDW), a coefficient of variation in red blood cell (RBC) volume, is routinely available in reports of complete blood count. RDW is commonly increased because of erythropoiesis deficits or accelerated RBC destruction. RDW increase is often considered as an indicator of anemia caused by iron, cobalamin, or folate deficiency. Recent studies have indicated that patients with higher RDW levels were associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular (CV) events and new-onset stroke. Moreover, the level of RDW was positively correlated with mortality in patients with acute or critical illnesses, in those with chronic diseases, and in healthy cohorts. Patel et al. reported a 14% increased risk of death for each 1% increment in RDW in a community-based elderly population.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) and anemia are well-known risk factors for CV events and mortality. RDW significantly increases when CKD progresses from stage 1 to stage 5. According to our review of the relevant literature, few reports have focused on RDW in patients with CKD. Hsieh et al. revealed that RDW was an independent predictor of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and infection mortality in CKD stages 3–5. Inadequate erythropoietin production is the primary feature of anemia in patients with CKD. Anemia reduces oxygen delivery and increases cardiac workload, which exacerbates heart failure and increases the risk of CV events. However, anemia is not the only possible explanation of elevated RDW in patients with CKD. The association of RDW with CV events and mortality was observed to be significant after adjustment for hemoglobin. In this study, we investigated the effect of RDW on major composite CV outcomes during CKD stages 1–5. We hypothesized that elevated RDW is an independent risk factor for CV events and mortality in patients with CKD.

### Relation between red blood cell distribution width and inflammatory biomarkers in a large cohort of unselected outpatients [^f83acf0b]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Context

A strong independent association has been recently observed between elevated red blood cell distribution width (RDW) and increased incidence of cardiovascular events.

Objective

To assess whether RDW is associated with plasma markers of inflammation since the mechanism(s) underlying this association remain unknown.

Design

We retrospectively analyzed results of RDW, hemoglobin, mean corpuscular volume, ferritin, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) in a large cohort of unselected adult outpatients who were consecutively referred by general practitioners for routine medical check-up.

Results

Cumulative results of RDW and other factors were retrieved from the database of our laboratory information system for 3845 adult outpatients during a 3-year period. When participants were grouped according to RDW quartiles, there were strong, graded increases of ESR and hsCRP (P < .001), both parameters being up to 3-fold higher in the fourth versus the first quartile. Accordingly, the percentages of those with hsCRP greater than 3 mg/L (from 28% to 63%; P < .001) and ESR greater than 40 mm/h (from 8% to 40%; P < .001) increased steadily across RDW quartiles. In multivariable regression analysis, ESR and hsCRP predicted RDW independently of age, sex, mean corpuscular volume, hemoglobin, and ferritin.

Conclusions

To our knowledge, our study demonstrates for the first time a strong, graded association of RDW with hsCRP and ESR independent of numerous confounding factors. If confirmed in future follow-up studies, this association might provide a rationale to introduce the easy, inexpensive RDW in algorithms for cardiovascular risk prediction.

### Altered red blood cell distribution width in overweight adolescents and its association with markers of inflammation [^4144ff06]. Pediatric Obesity (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Obesity and the metabolic syndrome are dramatically increasing problems. Red blood cell distribution width (RDW), the variability in size of circulating red blood cells, has been demonstrated to be altered in different clinical settings. This analysis aimed to investigate the relationship between RDW and obesity in adolescents and in an animal model of diet-induced obesity (DIO).

Methods

Seventy-nine male adolescents (aged 13–17 years) were studied. Thirty-seven of them were overweight (body mass index ≥ 90th percentile). RDW, markers of inflammation and stem cell factor (SCF) were determined. In an animal study, mice were fed with different diets for 15 weeks. RDW was determined using an animal blood count machine.

Results

RDW differed significantly between normal-weight adolescents (13.07 ± 0.09) and overweight adolescents (13.39 ± 0.10, P = 0.015), whereas erythrocyte counts and haematocrit did not differ. RDW correlated to markers of inflammation and inversely to SCF. In the mice animal model, nutritional changes increased RDW, whereas overweight per se did not change RDW.

Conclusions

RDW is elevated in overweight and reflects the inflammatory state. RDW potentially represents an additional and cost-effective tool to indicate inflammation. Future studies are needed to understand the differential influences of nutrition and overweight on RDW.

### Association between red blood cell distribution width and mortality and severity among patients with COVID-19: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^ed4e57d9]. Journal of Medical Virology (2021). Medium credibility.

Emerging evidence has underscored the potential usefulness of red blood cell distribution width (RDW) measurement in predicting the mortality and disease severity of COVID-19. This study aimed to assess the association of the plasma RDW levels with adverse prognosis in COVID-19 patients. A comprehensive literature search from inception to September 2020 was performed to harvest original studies reporting RDW on admission and clinical outcomes among patients hospitalized with COVID-19. RDW levels were compared between cases (patients who died or developed more severe symptoms) and controls (patients who survived or developed less severe symptoms). A total of 14,866 subjects from 10 studies were included in the meta-analysis. Higher levels of RDW were associated with adverse outcomes in COVID-19 patients (mean differences = 0.72; 95% CI = 0.47–0.97; I² = 89.51%). Deceased patients had higher levels of RDW compared to patients who survived (mean differences = 0.93; 95% CI = 0.63–1.23; I² = 85.58%). Severely ill COVID-19 patients showed higher levels of RDW, as opposed to patients classified to have milder symptoms (mean differences = 0.61; 95% CI = 0.28–0.94; I² = 82.18%). Elevated RDW levels were associated with adverse outcomes in COVID-19 patients. This finding warrants further research on whether RDW could be utilized as a simple and reliable biomarker for predicting COVID-19 severity and whether RDW is mechanistically linked with COVID-19 pathophysiology.

### Red blood cell distribution width as a surrogate biomarker of damage and disease activity in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus [^58987344]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Red blood cell distribution width (RDW) is a measure of variability in mean corpuscular volume. Alterations in RDW can be observed in a variety of human disorders, including inflammatory, cardiovascular, and hepatic or renal diseases. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease that can affect virtually any organ in the body. In this work, our objective was to analyse how a complete characterisation of disease characteristics in a large series of patients with SLE is related to RDW values.

Methods

284 patients with SLE and 181 age- and sex-matched healthy controls were recruited. Complete blood count including RDW was assessed. Multivariable analysis was performed to analyse the relationship between RDW and SLE disease characteristics, including composite scores of disease activity and damage.

Results

After multivariable adjustment, RDW was higher in patients with SLE compared to controls (beta coefficient 0.8 [95% confidence interval: 0.3–1] %, p = 0.003). Several disease characteristics, such as the presence of extractable nuclear antibodies and antiphospholipid syndrome, and the use of prednisone and azathioprine, were significantly associated with higher levels of RDW after adjustment for confounders. Of note, cumulative disease damage and disease activity scores were associated with higher RDW values after controlling for covariates.

Conclusions

RDW may serve as a surrogate biomarker of accrual disease damage and activity in patients with SLE.

### Red cell distribution width associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes in patients with chronic kidney disease [^50534230]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

In this study, we investigated the association of RDW with major composite CV outcomes and mortality in patients with CKD. The elevated RDW group had older patients, a lower proportion of male patients, lower LVEF levels, lower hemoglobin levels, lower albumin levels, and higher serum creatinine levels compared with the normal RDW group. RDW levels exhibited a graded increase across different stages of CKD. RDW ≥ 14.5% was associated with a significantly higher incidence of major composite CV outcomes and a trend toward higher mortality. A greater than 2-fold risk of major composite CV outcomes was observed in the elevated RDW group (HR = 2.581, CI = 1.541–4.322, P < .001). Age and impaired LVEF were additional covariates that were independent predictors of major composite CV outcomes in patients with CKD. The incidence of outcomes is higher than that reported in a previous study, because our patients were confirmed to have CAD.

Patients with higher RDW levels are often considered to have erythropoietic stress. In the general population, patients with higher RDW levels are likely to be older and have smoking habits, higher body mass index, lower hemoglobin levels, lower mean corpuscular volume, and higher serum creatinine levels. Elevated RDW was correlated with higher serum levels of N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), a larger left atrium, and lower LVEF values in patients with CV risk. RDW levels were also positively associated with C-reactive protein, the erythrocyte sedimentation rate, ferritin, and fibrinogen and negatively associated with albumin levels. Consequently, RDW was supposed to be a marker of inflammation, oxidative stress, and nutritional status.

The pathophysiology of elevated RDW toward unfavorable CV outcomes has not been elucidated. Anemia and elevated serum creatinine, commonly occurring in patients with CKD, were risk factors for CV events. Our results reveal that the effect of RDW on major composite CV outcomes was independent of hemoglobin and creatinine levels. This finding is consistent with those of previous studies, which have reported that the level of RDW, even within the normal reference range, was associated with a higher risk of CV events and mortality irrespective of anemia, ferritin levels, and renal impairment. There should be other explanations for the poor prognostic effect of RDW on major composite CV outcomes in patients with CKD. Two novel risk factors for CV events, oxidative stress and inflammation, could be possible underlying mechanisms.

### Association of red blood cell distribution width with mortality risk in hospitalized adults with SARS-CoV-2 infection [^87ac2d16]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Patients with many different underlying acute and chronic illnesses would be expected to have a higher baseline RDW, and it is possible that the RDW measured at admission is a nonspecific summary marker of the presence of these illnesses that have been shown to be associated with elevated RDW and may be expected to complicate the COVID-19 clinical course. Regardless of the reasons for the differences in RDW at admission, the association of elevated RDW with increased mortality risk appears to persist after admission, as demonstrated by the higher mortality rate for patients in the present cohort whose RDW increased during hospitalization.

Limitations

This study has limitations. It describes the potential value of RDW for risk stratification of admitted patients with COVID-19, but because the present analysis was limited to a hospitalized cohort, these results may not apply to individuals with COVID-19 who are not hospitalized. Because the time of initial infection was unavailable, these results are not specific to any disease progression time points. The cohort may have been underpowered for evaluation of mortality risk associated with self-reported Black/African American race. In addition, the socioeconomic status, of patients was unavailable, and the potential association of mortality risk with socioeconomic status could not be assessed. The study included few younger patients (206 patients younger than 40 years, 2 deaths), and results should only be considered valid for those older than 40 years. In addition, although results in this study spanned 4 hospitals, they are located in the same geographic region (Boston, Massachusetts). Although other studies support the potential value of RDW for risk stratification in inflammatory scenarios, this study cohort may not be representative of other US and non-US populations.

### Usefulness of red cell width distribution (RDW) in the assessment of children with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) [^a82e5b5d]. Pediatric Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Normal RDW in basic evaluation was found in 32 patients (N group, mean RDW 13.7 ± 0.8%), elevated in 29 (E group, mean RDW 17.0 ± 2.5). The comparison between groups was shown in Table 2. There were no statistically significant differences between groups in studied parameters.

Data of 31 patients without CW at least 12-month follow-up were analyzed. There were ten patients with initially elevated RDW (E) and 21 with normal (N). In whole group after 3 and 12 months of treatment, no change of RDW level was found despite of statistically significant improvement in WHO-FC and tend to decrease of NTproBNP level (NS) (Table 3).

Table 3
Comparison of data at diagnosis and after 3 and 12-month follow-up

Bold values — statistically significant differences

In both initial RDW-dependent groups (N and E) expected treatment response was observed. Number of patients with high-risk WHO-FC (III/IV) diminished after 1-year follow-up from 4 to 2 in group E (40–20%) and from 10 to 2 in group N (47–9%). NTproBNP changed in group E from 2596 ± 3233 pg/ml to 392 ± 282 pg/ml and in group N from 1212 ± 1645 pg/ml to 704 ± 1030 pg/ml. Because of too small groups statistical analysis was not performed.

### Ratio of red blood cell distribution width to albumin level and risk of mortality [^7b4e5aa5]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

In addition, RAR has also emerged as a reliable prognostic marker for other adverse outcomes in various diseases. Kimura et alconducted a retrospective cohort study of 997 patients with chronic kidney disease who were enrolled in the Fukushima Cohort Study. They found that patients in the highest tertile of RAR had a significantly greater risk of end-stage kidney disease (HR, 2.92 [95% CI, 1.44–5.94]), all-cause mortality (HR, 3.38 [95% CI, 1.81–6.30]), and cardiovascular events (HR, 2.27 [95% CI, 1.36–3.78]) than those in the lowest tertile of RAR. Huang et alincluded and analyzed 10 267 patients with congenital heart disease in China, and found that an elevated RAR was significantly associated with an increased risk of carotid plaque formation (odds ratio, 1.23 [95% CI, 1.08–1.39]). In summary, previous studies have indicated that RAR is relevant to the development of cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, and other chronic diseases. Therefore, we examined the association of RAR levels with cause-specific mortality in the NHANES and UK Biobank cohorts. Our findings provide strong epidemiologic evidence that elevated RAR levels are associated with an increased risk of cause-specific mortality in the general population.

The biological mechanisms underlying the association between higher RAR and mortality risk are unclear. These findings are likely due to chronic inflammation and nutritional status. Chronic inflammation and nutritional status play important roles in the development of mortality, and various chronic diseases, including cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and neurodegenerative disorders. The RDW reflects the degree of heterogeneity of erythrocyte volume. Increased RDW values can mirror impaired erythropoiesis and abnormal red blood cell survival through a variety of underlying metabolic abnormalities, such as inflammation and poor nutritional status. Serum albumin concentration is an important marker of nutritional status and the inflammatory response. Previous studies have reported that greater RDW, and lower serum albumin concentration, are both associated with an increased risk of incident chronic disease and mortality in the general population. Therefore, we hypothesized that the integration of these 2 markers may reflect inflammation, malnutrition, and other abnormalities throughout the lifespan and could be associated with all-cause and cause-specific mortality. Our study findings support the use of RAR as a derived biomarker in routine laboratory tests in practice and provided insights into the integration of common routine biomarkers.

### Red cell distribution width in alcohol abuse and iron deficiency anemia-reply… [^e9a35a57]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

In Reply. — Dr Seppä and Mr Sillanaukee suggest that high RDW and normal MCV may herald early alcohol abuse. It is true that liver disease has been described as a common cause of isolated increased RDW. 1, 2 The challenge would now be to distinguish alcohol abuse per se from the liver disease that commonly results from alcohol abuse. Another point to note is that both early pernicious anemia and alcohol abuse-liver disease tend to be associated with high normal MCV, unlike early iron deficiency, which is associated with lownormal MCV. 1 As in many other analyses with broad normal ranges, different parts of "normal" mean different things. We would concur that a high-normal MCV and high RDW suggest liver disease — alcohol abuse, early megaloblastic deficiency, and/or cytotoxic chemotherapy. As shown in our data, early iron deficiency with a normal MCV is predominantly found in the lower half. Bessman JD, McClure S.

### Efficiency of red cell distribution width in identification of children aged 1–3 years with iron deficiency anemia against traditional hematological markers [^87569899]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Iron deficiency is the most common micronutrient deficiency among Indian preschool children contributing to increased burden of morbidity and mortality and the most significant negative consequence of iron deficiency is iron deficiency anemia (IDA). Recent NFHS–III surveys (2005–06) have shown that 70–85% (approx. 79.2%) of Indian young children have anemia. IDA is attributed to inadequate iron intake, poor bioavailability of iron or high nutritional needs during childhood which is further exacerbated by chronic intestinal blood losses due to helminth infections and in many areas due to severe malarial infections. Studies have shown that iron deficiency causes delay in cognitive development and poor motor and sensory system functioning and that iron supplementation in early years may prevent these complications among children. Conversely, there is an evidence suggesting that routine iron treatment in non-iron deficient children may have adverse consequences for morbidity and infections. Therefore, it is very important to detect iron deficiency (ID) at its earliest stage in children especially in a low resource setting and replenish the iron stores by proper supplementation, thereby preventing many of the adverse developmental and behavioral effects caused by IDA. Currently, the detection of IDA is largely dependent upon quantification of biochemical markers like serum ferritin (SFr), serum transferrin (STr) and zinc protoporphyrin (ZnPP) which are not routinely available and affordable in developing countries due to high costs. Moreover, these tests are altered by inflammation, which limits their applicability for clinical interpretation, especially in areas with high infection rates. Another limitation of the commonly used hematological tests is their poor sensitivity or specificity as they can be modified by conditions other than iron deficiency. Studies have shown that RDW in addition to other hematological markers like mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and hemoglobin can be used as a differential diagnostic tool for identification of iron deficiency anemia. Various studies also show that the onset of iron deficiency anemia can be predicted using automated blood analyzers, as a low haemoglobin level along with a high level of anisocytosis detectable by red cell distribution width prove to be good indicators of changes in blood due to depleted iron stores. It seems that the earliest hematological manifestation of iron deficiency is marked by an elevated level of RDW and reports have shown that it is a cost-effective screening tool for early diagnosis of IDA in comparison to SFr and ZnPP. The red blood cell (RBC) distribution width, a measure of variations in the width of circulating RBCs, reported as a part of complete blood count has been known to be of value in the discrimination of iron deficiency anemia from other causes of microcytic anemia, but studies in pediatric populations are lacking. Thus, in the present study we evaluated the discriminative ability of RDW diagnostic test for detecting iron deficiency anemia among children aged 1–3 yrs in a low socio-economic setting using receiver's operating characteristic curve (ROC) analyses.

### Red cell distribution width associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes in patients with chronic kidney disease [^aaaec72e]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Results

A total of 282 patients with CKD who were admitted for CAD in 2011 were enrolled in this study. Patients were divided into normal RDW (RDW < 14.5%; n = 213) and elevated RDW (RDW ≥ 14.5%, n = 69) groups. The baseline characteristics of the study cohort are presented in Table 1. The elevated RDW group had older patients than did the normal RDW group (68.2 ± 13.1 vs 63.7 ± 13.8, P = 0.018) and also had a lower proportion of male patients (62.3% vs 77.9%, P = 0.017). Moreover, patients in the elevated RDW group presented significantly lower left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF; 48.4 ± 18.4 vs 55.6 ± 15.7, P = 0.017), lower hemoglobin levels (11.3 ± 2.1 vs 13.4 ± 2.3, P < .001), lower serum albumin levels (3.6 ± 0.5 vs 3.8 ± 0.5, P = 0.005), and higher creatinine levels (1.89 ± 1.58 vs 1.31 ± 0.93, P < .001), compared with those in the normal RDW group. The baseline characteristics of the 2 groups were similar in terms of comorbidities, systolic and diastolic BP, leukocyte count, platelet count, alanine aminotransferase levels, sodium levels, potassium levels, sugar levels, total cholesterol levels, low-density lipoprotein levels, HDL levels, and medications. During the 3-year follow-up period, the elevated RDW group exhibited a higher incidence of major composite CV outcomes (46.4% vs 17.8%, P < .001). No statistical difference was observed; however, a trend toward higher mortality was noted in the elevated RDW group (10.1% vs 3.8%, P = 0.059).

### Red blood cell indexes in patients in patients with hereditary spherocytosis and β-thalassemia combination [^6704e5b2]. Pediatric Hematology and Oncology (2002). Low credibility.

The spontaneous occurrence of hereditary spherocytosis (HS) and beta-thalassemia in the same patient is a rare event. The mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration is elevated above the reference range in half to two-thirds of patients with HS, but there are no data for the HS/beta-thal combinations for the red blood cell indexes. This study reassessed these values in these particular patients. Hemoglobin, hematocrit, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), red cell distribution (RDW), and reticulocyte count were documented from 43 HS patients, 13 of which were from 10 families with the combination of beta-thal and HS; 28 controls were also included. Patients with HS/beta-thal have a significantly lower MCV, mean corpuscular hemoglobin, and MCHC and a significantly higher RDW than normal control subjects; 95% of beta-thalassemia carriers are free of clinical symptoms. When red blood cell indexes reveal a possibility of a beta-thalassemia carrier state with the symptoms of hemolytic anemia, HS should be considered.

### Red blood cell distribution width and the risk of death in middle-aged and older adults… [^33541999]. JAMA Network (2009). Excellent credibility.

Results Higher RDW values were strongly associated with an increased risk of death. Compared with the lowest quintile of RDW, the following were adjusted hazard ratios for all-cause mortality: second quintile, HR, 1. 1; third quintile. For every 1% increment in RDW, all-cause mortality risk increased by 22%. Even when analyses were restricted to nonanemic participants or to those in the reference range of RDW without iron, folate, or vitamin B12 deficiency, RDW remained strongly associated with mortality. The prognostic effect of RDW was observed in both middle-aged and older adults for multiple causes of death. Red blood cell distribution width is routinely assessed as part of the complete blood count to gather information on the heterogeneity in the size of circulating erythrocytes.

Computationally, RDW is the coefficient of variation of red blood cell volume, and therefore higher RDW values reflect greater heterogeneity in RBC size, which is usually caused by perturbation in erythrocyte maturation or degradation. Associations were independent of multiple potential confounding factors. Even when participants with high RDW values or nutritional deficiencies were excluded, RDW remained strongly associated with mortality. Importantly, RDW predicted mortality among participants who were clearly nonanemic. Summary measures of global model fit, model calibration, and model discrimination further showed that RDW significantly improved mortality risk prediction. The magnitude and robustness of these associations indicate that RDW is an age-associated biomarker that is prognostic in adults 45 years or older. As a validation, Felker et al4 also showed a 2-fold increased mortality risk comparing the highest RDW quintile with the lowest in a separate clinical cohort of patients with heart failure. Similarly, Tonelli et al5 analyzed data from a randomized controlled trial of patients with coronary artery disease and reported that death was twice as likely in patients with an RDW greater than 13. 8% vs those with an RDW less than
12. 6%.

### Ratio of red blood cell distribution width to albumin level and risk of mortality [^456d4cf1]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is the ratio of red blood cell distribution width to albumin concentration (RAR) associated with mortality in the general population?

Findings

In this cohort study involving 469 572 participants at baseline and 44 383 deaths during follow-up periods, higher RAR levels were associated with increased risks of all-cause and cause-specific mortality.

Meaning

These findings suggest that the RAR, assessed via routine laboratory tests, could be a promising indicator that is simple, reliable, and inexpensive for identifying individuals at high risk of mortality in clinical practice.

### Usefulness of red cell width distribution (RDW) in the assessment of children with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) [^a4ecebd1]. Pediatric Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Materials and Methods

Results of lab tests performed between 1995 and 2017 in 61 patients with PAH confirmed by right heart catheterization were analyzed retrospectively. Blood count (hematocrit hemoglobin, MCV and RDW) were analyzed at diagnosis (basic results), 3 and 12 months after initial therapy and during clinical worsening and 3 and 12 months later. Patients with anemia (abnormal MCV and Hb below normal range) or infectious disease (anamnesis, elevated biomarkers — leucocytes and/or CRP) were excluded. Clinical worsening (CW) was defined as death or lung transplantation or clinical deterioration requiring treatment intensification (new medication, Potts shunt, atrioseptostomy) — the first event was used to calculate the time to clinical worsening. RDW was compared with NTproBNP, WHO-FC and oxygen blood saturation (SaO 2). WHO-FC was analyzed in two groups I/II WHO-FC (low risk) and III/IV WHO-FC (high risk).

Additionally because of possible influence of cyanosis and hyperviscosity on RDW data of patients with Eisenmenger syndrome (defined as shunt and rest blood saturation below 90% HbO 2) including blood saturation, hematocrit, hemoglobin, MCV and RDW were compared with data of other patients.

According to basic results patients were divided into two groups: with normal (N) and elevated (E) RDW. Normal value for RDW in children below 12 years depends on age, for the study it was adopted according to Novak (Table 1). Upper limit was established as mean + 2SD. For children above 12 years normal range for adults 11–14.5% was used.

Table 1
Age-appropriate values for RDW (Novak)

Comparison between two groups included: age, gender, diagnosis, presence of Down syndrome, shunt (from significant, contributing to PAH development, to even small like PFO), Eisenmenger syndrome and data from right heart catheterization. Hemodynamic parameters for analysis (SvO 2, mRAP, PVRI, CI, mPAP/mSAP) were chosen according to previous studies in children because of influence on prognosis.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for vitamin B12 deficiency, more specifically with respect to indications for screening, IBD, ECCO 2015 guidelines recommend to obtain standard anemia workup (including at least RBC indices such as red cell distribution width and MCV, reticulocyte count, differential blood cell count, serum ferritin, transferrin saturation, and CRP concentration) in patients with low hemoglobin levels. Include serum vitamin B12 measurement in a more extensive workup.

### Importance of RDW value in differential diagnosis of hypochrome anemias [^51619e83]. American Journal of Hematology (2002). Low credibility.

Red cell distribution width (RDW) was studied in adults carrying delta-beta thalassemia traits (deltabeta-TT) who were 20–40 years of age (n = 29), beta thalassemia traits (beta-TT) with an age range of 18–60 years (n = 49), iron deficiency anemia (IDA) in individuals aged 1–18 years (n = 27), and in controls with an age range of 20–40 years (n = 20). Although red blood cell count, MCV, and MCH values showed no statistically significant differences between deltabeta-TT and beta-TT, the mean RDW value was significantly higher in deltabeta-TT (20.14 ± 1.21) compared to beta-TT (14.88 ± 1.77) (P < 0.001). No difference was observed between the means of RDW in deltabeta-TT and IDA (18.00 ± 1.94) (P > 0.05). A significant rise in RDW in IDA 5–7 days after initiation of iron therapy (P = 0.00) which was continued to rise up to the 4(th) week of therapy was suggested as an important tool in differentiation of IDA from deltabeta-TT. These observations could be kept in mind in the differential diagnosis of deltabeta-TT from beta-TT and IDA by determining the red blood cell count, red cell indices, and RDW only.

### Red cell distribution width associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes in patients with chronic kidney disease [^738fa0b1]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Recent studies have demonstrated that red cell distribution width (RDW) is associated with cardiovascular (CV) events and mortality. Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are often anemic and have high RDW levels. In this study, we investigated the effect of RDW on major composite CV outcomes among patients with CKD.

Methods

We retrospectively analyzed patients with CKD who were admitted to the department of cardiology of a tertiary hospital in 2011. The patients were divided into 2 groups: normal RDW (RDW < 14.5%) and elevated RDW (RDW ≥ 14.5%). Demographic characteristics, comorbidities, blood investigation results, prescriptions, and outcomes were analyzed after a 3-year follow-up period. Six adjustment levels were performed to evaluate the effect of RDW on outcomes.

Results

This study involved 282 patients with CKD: 213 in the elevated RDW group and 69 in the normal RDW group. The elevated RDW group had older patients, a lower proportion of male patients, lower left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) values, lower hemoglobin levels, lower serum albumin levels, and higher creatinine levels, compared with the normal RDW group. A linear trend was observed toward higher RDW in patients with deteriorating renal function. In the final adjusted model, RDW ≥ 14.5%, older age, and lower LVEF were associated with an increased risk of major composite CV outcomes.

Conclusion

RDW is a potentially useful cost-effective indicator of major composite CV outcomes in patients with CKD.

### Red cell distribution width and mortality in Hemodialysis Patients [^f5382a1b]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Red cell distribution width (RDW) is an index of red blood cell volume variability that has historically been used as a marker of iron deficiency anemia. More recently, studies have shown that elevated RDW is associated with higher mortality risk in the general population. However, there is lack of data demonstrating the association between RDW and mortality risk in hemodialysis (HD) patients. We hypothesized that higher RDW is associated with higher mortality in HD patients.

Study Design

Retrospective observational study using a large HD patient cohort.

Setting & Participants

109,675 adult maintenance HD patients treated in a large dialysis organization from January 1, 2007, to December 31, 2011.

Predictor

Baseline and time-varying RDW, grouped into 5 categories: < 14.5%, 14.5% to < 15.5%, 15.5% to < 16.5%, 16.5% to < 17.5%, and ≥ 17.5%. RDW of 15.5% to < 16.5% was used as the reference category.

Outcome

All-cause mortality.

Results

Mean age of study participants was 63 ± 15 (SD) years and the study cohort was 44% women. In baseline and time-varying analyses, there was a graded association between higher RDW and incrementally higher mortality risk. Receiver operating characteristic, net reclassification analysis, and integrated discrimination improvement analyses demonstrated that RDW is a stronger predictor of mortality as compared with traditional markers of anemia, such as hemoglobin, ferritin, and iron saturation values.

Limitations

Lack of comprehensive data that may be associated with both RDW and HD patient outcomes, such as blood transfusion data, socioeconomic status, and other unknown confounders; therefore, the possibility of residual confounding could not be excluded. Also, lack of information for cause of death; thus, cardiovascular mortality outcomes could not be examined.

Conclusions

In HD patients, higher RDW is associated with incrementally higher mortality risk. RDW is also a stronger predictor of mortality than traditional laboratory markers of anemia. Further studies are needed to determine the mechanisms underlying the association between RDW and mortality.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for Crohn's disease, more specifically with respect to evaluation of anemia, ECCO 2015 guidelines recommend to obtain anemia workup (including at least RBC indices such as red cell distribution width and MCV, reticulocyte count, differential blood cell count, serum ferritin, transferrin saturation, and CRP concentration) if the hemoglobin is below normal. Include the following in a more extensive workup: serum concentrations of vitamin B12, folic acid, haptoglobin, the percentage of hypochromic red cells, reticulocyte hemoglobin, LDH, soluble transferrin receptor, creatinine, and urea.

### Red cell distribution width as a marker of coeliac disease: a prospective study [^b7a93910]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Coeliac disease is frequently underdiagnosed because of its protean presentations. Serological tests may be helpful in screening programmes for populations at risk, but they are costly.

Aim

To determine prospectively whether a commonly available haematological test such as the red cell distribution width (RDW) could be of help in detecting unrecognized coeliac disease.

Methods

Of 353 consecutive adult patients referred to our outpatient malabsorption clinic, 198 in whom clinical suspicion was strong were referred for further investigations and intestinal biopsy. Seventy-six inflammatory bowel disease outpatients and 90 subjects admitted for diseases other than malabsorption were enrolled as the control group.

Results

RDW was increased in 94 (47.4%) and normal in 104 (52.5%) of 198 patients. Duodenal biopsy confirmed coeliac disease in 80 (85.1%) of the former patients and 69 (66.3%) of the latter patients. No correlation between RDW values and histological scores was found. Overall RDW increase was found in 80/149 (53.7%) patients with a definite diagnosis of coeliac disease, and in 14/49 (28.6%) patients in whom biopsy excluded the disease. A 1-year gluten withdrawal led to a significant decrease in RDW value, even in patients with obdurate mucosal impairment.

Conclusions

In patients in whom there is a strong clinical suspicion of coeliac disease, an elevated RDW despite normal haemoglobin concentration may be a reliable predictor of the disease.

### The effect of intravenous ferric carboxymaltose on red cell distribution width: a subanalysis of the FAIR-HF study [^050fa2ca]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2013). Low credibility.

Aims

Red cell distribution width (RDW), a measure of variability in red blood cell size, is a novel prognostic marker in chronic heart failure (CHF). Iron deficiency contributes to elevated RDW. In the FAIR-HF trial, i.v. ferric carboxymaltose (FCM) improved the 6 min walk test (6MWT) distance in iron-deficient CHF patients. We studied the effect of FCM on RDW and the relationship between RDW and 6MWT distance.

Methods and Results

In FAIR-HF, iron-deficient CHF patients were randomized to FCM or placebo in a 2:1 ratio. From the total cohort (n = 459), we included 415 patients in whom RDW values and 6MWT distance were available for baseline and at least one follow-up visit (after 4, 12, and 24 weeks). Baseline RDW was higher in anaemic (haemoglobin < 12 g/dL) compared with non-anaemic patients [15.2% (14.0–16.8) vs. 14.2% (13.4–15.4), P < 0.0001, median (interquartile range)]. In multivariate analysis, RDW was significantly associated with transferrin saturation (P < 0.001) and C-reactive protein levels (P = 0.002). Treatment with FCM led to a biphasic response; RDW increased within 4 weeks (+0.54% absolute change from baseline, P = 0.01) but fell to values below the placebo group after 24 weeks (-1.0%, P = 0.03). The 6MWT distance and RDW were inversely related at baseline (r = -0.30, P < 0.0001). In all patients, the increase in 6MWT distance after 24 weeks was significantly correlated with a decrease in RDW (r = -0.25, P < 0.0001), even after adjustment for changes in haemoglobin.

Conclusions

Iron deficiency in CHF is associated with high RDW, even after adjustment for the presence of anaemia. Treatment with i.v. FCM in iron-deficient CHF patients decreases RDW.

### The pathogenesis, diagnosis and management of congenital dyserythropoietic anaemia type I [^07dec496]. British Journal of Haematology (2019). Medium credibility.

Haematology and biochemical assays

A full blood count typically reveals moderate macrocytic anaemia, with a haemoglobin (Hb) of 66–116 g/l (mean 92 g/l), mean corpuscular volume (MCV) 100–120 and reticulocytopenia, although 30% of cases have a normal MCV (Wickramasinghe, 1998). There are reports of transient neutropenia/thrombocytopenia, but these lineages are generally unaffected (Meznarich et al, 2018). The hallmark of CDA‐I is an absolute or relative reticulocytopenia, indicative of ineffective erythropoiesis (Heimpel, 2004). Ineffective erythropoiesis was originally demonstrated using ferrokinetic studies, where the fraction of 59 Fe present in peripheral red blood cells is calculated 2 weeks post‐intravenous infusion. Where erythropoiesis is effective, e.g. when anaemia occurs due to bleeding, iron deficiency or haemolysis, the fraction of red cells containing 59 Fe is ~75–80%, but in ineffective erythropoiesis, it may be as low as 25–30% (Lewis, 2001). Recently, a new clinical index, termed the bone marrow responsiveness index (BMRI), has been developed to discriminate haemolytic anaemia from ineffective erythropoiesis. This is defined as: [(absolute reticulocyte count) × (patient Hb/normal Hb)] and was shown to be a highly sensitive parameter (90.4%) to achieve a clinical diagnosis of CDA‐II. This metric is likely to be useful in CDA‐I but is yet to be formally validated in this disease.

The blood film, as illustrated in Fig 2, is markedly abnormal with anisocytosis and various poikilocytes, including teardrops, ovalocytes, elliptocytes, microspherocytes, irregularly contracted red cells (Heimpel et al, 2010) and occasional nucleated red cells (Tamary & Dgany, 2009), although these are not a typical feature. Red cell distribution width, as a quantitative assessment of the aniosopoikilocytosis seen on films, is elevated in CDA‐I (Wickramasinghe, 1998; Kamiya & Manabe, 2010). Renal and liver function are normal unless perturbed secondary to severe iron overload, but unconjugated bilirubin and lactate dehydrogenase will be elevated from the haemolysis and ineffective erythropoiesis. Haptoglobin levels are reduced secondary to intra‐ and extra‐vascular haemolysis (Heimpel, 2004).

### CDC recommendations for lead poisoning prevention in newly arrived refugee children [^10972d06]. CDC (2006). Medium credibility.

Early post-arrival evaluation and therapy — Upon US arrival, all refugee children should have nutritional evaluations performed, and should be provided with appropriate nutritional and vitamin supplements as indicated. Pre-existing health burdens and iron deficiency increase lead absorption through the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. At a minimum, the nutritional evaluation should include an evaluation of the children's iron status including a hemoglobin/hematocrit and one or more of the following: an evaluation of the mean corpuscular volume (MCV) combined with red cell distribution width (RDW); ferritin; transferrin saturation; or reticulocyte hemoglobin content. Evaluate the value of iron supplementation among refugee children, with study of iron supplementation expected to provide needed data on its efficacy to reduce nutritional deficiencies and reduce lead absorption through the GI tract.

### Red blood cell distribution width and the platelet count in iron-deficient children aged 0.5–3 years [^ee97da86]. Pediatric Hematology and Oncology (2015). Low credibility.

Early detection of iron deficiency (ID) and iron deficiency anemia (IDA) in young children is important to prevent impaired neurodevelopment. Unfortunately, many biomarkers of ID are influenced by infection, thus limiting their usefulness. The aim of this study was to investigate the value of red blood cell distribution width (RDW) and the platelet count for detecting ID(A) among otherwise healthy children. A multicenter prospective observational study was conducted in the Netherlands to investigate the prevalence of ID(A) in 400 healthy children aged 0.5–3 years. ID was defined as serum ferritin (SF) < 12 μg/L in the absence of infection (C-reactive protein [CRP] < 5 mg/L) and IDA as hemoglobin < 110 g/L combined with ID. RDW (%) and the platelet count were determined in the complete blood cell count. RDW was inversely correlated with SF and not associated with CRP. Calculated cutoff values for RDW to detect ID and IDA gave a relatively low sensitivity (53.1% and 57.1%, respectively) and specificity (64.7% and 69.9%, respectively). Anemic children with a RDW > 14.3% had a 2.7 higher odds (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.2–6.3) to be iron deficient, compared with anemic children with a RDW < 14.3%. The platelet count showed a large range in both ID and non-ID children. In conclusion, RDW can be helpful for identifying ID as the cause of anemia in 0.5- to 3-year-old children, but not as primary biomarker of ID(A). RDW values are not influenced by the presence of infection. There appears to be no role for the platelet count in diagnosing ID(A) in this group of children.

### Significance of the red blood cell distribution width in resected pathologic stage I nonsmall cell lung cancer [^c46bf90c]. Seminars in Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Red blood cell distribution width (RDW) is a parameter measured in blood sample tests that reflects the variation in the volume of erythrocytes and used to differentiate an anemic state. The RDW has been used to predict a poor survival in various types of cancer; however, the prognostic impact of the RDW in resected pathologic stage I nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients remains to be elucidated. A total of 273 patients with resected pathologic stage I NSCLC were included in this study. The cut-off value of RDW was set at 14.5, which was the upper limit of the normal range of the RDW. The controlling nutritional status (CONUT) score, which was calculated by the albumin, cholesterol, and the lymphocyte count, was also investigated. Among 273 patients, 34 (12.5%) were RDW-high, while 239 (87.5%) were RDW-low. RDW-high was significantly associated with a lower body mass index (P < 0.01), a lower level of hemoglobin (P < 0.01), a higher level of C-reactive protein (P < 0.01), and a high CONUT score (P = 0.03) than RDW-low. Patients with RDW-high exhibited significantly shorter recurrence-free and overall survivals (RFS and OS, respectively) than those with RDW-low (P < 0.01 and P < 0.01, respectively). Multivariate analyses showed that the RDW was an independent prognostic factor for both the RFS and OS (RFS, hazard ratio [HR]: 2.16, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.14–3.95, P = 0.02; OS, HR: 2.44, 95% CI: 1.28–4.49, P < 0.01). The RDW was shown to be associated with a worse long-term prognosis in resected pathologic stage I NSCLC patients.

### A reference model of circulating hematopoietic stem cells across the lifespan with applications to diagnostics [^4d9e713b]. Nature Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

Main

The basis for understanding and defining human pathophysiological states is a detailed description of interindividual heterogeneity among healthy individuals. Large population studies have identified wide interindividual differences in complete blood counts (CBCs) of healthy individualsand exposed different age-related blood count changes, such as high red blood cell (RBC) distribution width (RDW), macrocytic anemia and a reduction in absolute lymphocyte counts. The establishment of reference values, or population-wide normal ranges for certain blood parameters, has been crucial for patient evaluation, diagnosis and treatment.

Although CBC reference ranges are used in the clinic daily, the equivalent reference range for hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) has not been established so far. As HSPCs reside mainly in the bone marrow (BM), access to these cells, especially in the healthy population, has been problematic, whereas their general paucity in the circulation made it quite challenging to characterize them efficiently from the blood. This has become feasible given modern technologies such as single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq).

### Prognostic value of red cell distribution width and mean corpuscular volume on mortality in hemodialysis patients [^058a1ad5]. Seminars in Dialysis (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Anemia is a common consequence of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Red cell distribution width (RDW) and mean corpuscular volume (MCV) are principally used for differential diagnosis of anemia. Limited evidence is available for its prognostic value for mortality in hemodialysis (HD) patients. We aimed to definite the relationship between RDW and MCV and mortality in HD patients.

Method

This cohort study examined all-cause and cardiovascular (CV) mortality with 181 maintenance HD patients from February 2015. Patients were divided into four groups according to the median of RDW and MCV. Pearson analysis was conducted to determine the related factors of RDW and MCV. The independent association of RDW and MCV with mortality was examined with Kaplan-Meier curve and Cox regression analysis.

Results

This study included 181 HD patients for a median follow-up of 71months. We found RDW was positively related to neutrophil count, C-reaction protein, and ferritin, while negatively related to hemoglobin, albumin, and creatinine. Only neutrophil count and ferritin were significantly related to MCV in this study. In the multivariate Cox regression analysis, the high RDW group was associated with higher risk of all-cause mortality (odds ratio, 3.787; 95% confidence interval, 1.037 to 13.834; p = 0.044). The relationship between RDW and MCV and CV mortality was not significant.

Conclusions

RDW could emerge as an additive risk factor for all-cause mortality in maintenance HD patients, independent of other factors. An absolute value of MCV to predict mortality and the underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms should be confirmed in the future.

### Red cell distribution width as a marker of activity in inflammatory bowel disease: a narrative review [^62d22b8d]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Concluding remarks

The results from studies included in this review showed that mean values of RDW were statistically significantly higher in IBD patients compared to controls. With respect to the rather limited data, based on only 2 clinical trials, RDW could be used as an effective marker to differentiate CD from UC in both the active state and remission. In the majority of the aforementioned studies RDW, at different cutoff values, showed a remarkable sensitivity and specificity in detecting active disease, calculated by means of clinical indices, endoscopic scores and laboratory parameters. RDW also showed a positive but variable correlation with well-established inflammatory biomarkers used in everyday clinical practice such as CRP, ESR, and to a lesser extent WBC and PLT, in both anemic and non-anemic IBD patients. Therefore, RDW could be considered an attractive disease activity marker in IBD, as it is calculated automatically in every CBC, has a low cost, is minimally invasive, has no specific technical requirements and can be easily reproduced.

On the other hand, there are certain aspects concerning its broad application that must be elucidated. There was great variability in the thresholds adopted for the assessment of diagnostic accuracy. In addition, the selection of cutoffs was arbitrary and data driven. Most studies were retrospective and were case-control studies. The use of controls in diagnostic accuracy studies usually results in overestimation of both sensitivity and specificity. Large-scale well-designed prospective studies for standardization of the cutoff value of RDW should now be mandatory. It is also necessary to conduct such studies in order to evaluate whether the limited but rather encouraging data are sufficient to establish RDW as a reliable activity index. Finally, there is a need to look deeper and clarify the pathophysiology of this relation. RDW seems to be a promising cost-effective tool that can be used to evaluate and monitor disease activity in IBD, but this requires more extensive and detailed research in the future.

### Red cell distribution width and dementia among rural-dwelling older adults: the MIND-China study [^084c709f]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2021). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Dementia affects over 50 million people worldwide, and nearly 60%of all dementia patients live in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Notably, the number of people with dementia is projected to increase faster in LMICs than in high-income countries in the coming decades. Since the 1990s the prevalence of dementia in China has increased steadily in all age groups from 60 years of age. The total annual expenditure for dementia in China was estimated at US$168 billion. The prevalence of dementia was notably higher in the rural than urban communities. Given that there is currently no curative therapy available for dementia, identifying modifiable risk factors is crucial for preventive and therapeutic interventions to delay the onset of dementia and slow cognitive decline.

The red blood cell distribution width (RDW) is a simple parameter that reflects the heterogeneity of circulating erythrocyte volume. It is routinely calculated by the overwhelming majority of hematologic analyzers according to red blood cell (RBC) volume and mean corpuscular volume (MCV). A normal RDW suggests homogeneous RBC size, whereas an elevated RDW indicates heterogeneous RBC size, known as anisocytosis. RDW in combination with MCV can used for differential diagnosis of anemia. An elevated RDW is often related to anemia due to nutrient deficiency (e.g. iron, vitamin B12, and folic acid) and sideroblastic anemia, and a normal RDW is often related to anemia from chronic disease, thalassemia heterozygosity, and aplastic anemia. Studies have shown that an increased RDW is associated with mortality, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, stroke, and other chronic health conditions. The association of RDW with adverse health outcomes may depend on anemia or hemoglobin levels. Of note, the cross-sectional data from the Chicago Health and Aging Project found that elevated RDW was associated with dementia, especially among non-anemic participants. In addition, evidence has been accumulating over the last decade that anemia or low hemoglobin is related to cognitive impairment and dementia among older adults. However, most population-based studies of anemia and dementia have been conducted among high-income countries. In particular, the relationship of abnormal RDW with dementia and cognitive function as well as the interplay of increased RDW and anemia in cognitive aging has yet to be explored among LMICs.

Therefore, in this population-based cross-sectional study of older adults living in the rural communities in China, we sought 1) to evaluate the associations of RDW and anemia with dementia and global cognitive function; and 2) to explore whether their association varied by anemia status.

### Increased monocyte count and red cell distribution width as prognostic biomarkers in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis [^d7145f1d]. Respiratory Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) represents a chronic, progressive lung disease with dismal prognosis despite the advent of novel antifibrotic compounds. The disease course is highly variable and prognosis remains challenging. A clinicians' friendly, easily applicable and cost-effective prognostic biomarker with uniform cut-off values that will guide disease stratification and tailoring of therapeutic approaches is missing. Several biomarkers including Mucin 5b and Toll-interacting protein single nucleotide polymorphisms, telomere length and gene expression signatures have been suggested as reliable prognosticators in patients with IPF; yet, measurement of such biomarkers remains laborious and requires expensive and sophisticated infrastructure. In addition, lack of standardization of samples' collection protocols leading to non-reproducible cut-off thresholds, further limits their widespread clinical applicability.

Abundant evidence has highlighted the role of Complete Blood Count (CBC) in the prognostication of patients with various chronic lung diseases. Asthma researchers are currently using peripheral eosinophils to implement anti-IL5/13 therapeutic regimens. Three major studies, encompassing an overall of almost 10,000 patients with IPF and scleroderma-associated interstitial lung disease have recently identified elevated peripheral blood monocyte count as a biomarker of disease progression and mortality. Given that monocyte count is a clinically applicable and inexpensive biomarker, these findings warrant further investigation in real-life studies. In line with this concept another parameter of CBC, red cell distribution width (RDW), has been associated with worse clinical outcomes in several chronic lung diseases including IPF and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Increased RDW seems to represent a biomarker of early hypoxemia.

To this end, our aim was to evaluate the prognostic role of parameters of CBC, including monocyte count and RDW in two independent cohorts (derivation and validation) of patients with IPF in a real-life clinical setting.

### Red cell distribution width is an independent predictor of mortality in necrotizing fasciitis [^a1bb980d]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Necrotizing fasciitis (NF) is a rapidly progressing and potentially lethal infectious disease of the soft tissue. An elevated red blood cell distribution width (RDW) is associated with increased risk of death in patients with heart disease and infectious disease. We retrospectively assessed the association of elevated RDW with in-hospital mortality due to NF.

Methods

All patients had diagnoses of NF and were admitted to the emergency department of a single institution in Taiwan over a 4-year period. Demographics, comorbidities, clinical presentations, and laboratory parameters were retrospectively reviewed. Red blood cell distribution width was categorized as elevated (> 14.5%) or not elevated. Multivariate regression analysis was used to identify risk factors associated with mortality.

Results

A total of 98 patients were enrolled, and the mortality rate was 23%. Univariate analysis indicated that advanced age, initial hypotension, low hemoglobin level, and elevated RDW (69.6% vs 20%, OR = 9.14, P < .001) were significantly associated with mortality. Multivariate analysis indicated that RDW was a significant and independent predictor of mortality in enrolled patients.

Conclusions

Elevated RDW is a significant and independent predictor of in-hospital mortality for patients with NF.

### Red cell distribution width in heart failure: prediction of clinical events and relationship with markers of ineffective erythropoiesis, inflammation, renal function, and nutritional state [^100a1232]. American Heart Journal (2009). Low credibility.

Objectives

The goal of this study was to independently validate the recent observations on the predictive role of red cell distribution width (RDW) for outcomes in chronic heart failure and to provide epidemiologic data on the biological correlates of RDW in heart failure (HF). Understanding the mechanism underlying this observation is unclear, largely hampered by the lack of epidemiologic studies demonstrating factors that are associated with anisocytosis in cardiovascular diseases.

Methods

One hundred ninety-five patients (145 men, 50 women) with systolic HF were enrolled and followed up for a median of 14.5 months. Primary end points were all-cause mortality and hospital readmission due to worsening HF symptoms. A total of 19 clinical chemistry, hematology, and biochemical variables were considered for analysis together with clinical parameters in Cox proportional hazards and multiple regression models.

Results

Red cell distribution width was found to be an N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide independent predictor of all-cause mortality (adjusted HR 1.61 per 1 SD increase) in our study. Multiple correlations between biomarkers of ineffective erythropoiesis (serum iron, ferritin, and soluble transferrin receptor levels), inflammation and acute-phase reaction (interleukin-6, soluble tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor I and soluble TNF receptor II, C-reactive protein, and prealbumin concentrations), undernutrition (total cholesterol and albumin levels), and renal function were observed. In the multiple regression model, the strongest relationship for RDW was obtained with soluble transferrin receptor, soluble TNF receptor I, soluble TNF receptor II, and total cholesterol.

Conclusions

Here we validate the strong, independent prediction of morbidity and mortality in HF by RDW. The described correlations between RDW and inflammation, ineffective erythropoiesis, undernutrition, and impaired renal function may facilitate the understanding why this marker is associated with adverse outcomes in HF.

### Diagnosis and treatment of anemia in patients with inflammatory bowel disease [^fbf05c15]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Traditionally, the distinction between different causes of anemia is based on a hematological algorithm starting with the interpretation of the mean corpuscular volume (MCV). Accordingly, micro-, macro- or normocytic erythrocyte conditions may hint at different causes for anemia. Besides MCV, basic laboratory parameters should include reticulocyte count, differential blood cell count, red cell distribution width, and serum ferritin, TfS and C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations. In patients with postoperative CD or severe ileitis, serum levels of vitamin B12 and folic acid should also be evaluated. In patients with signs of hemolysis or significant comorbidities, haptoglobin, the percentage of hypochromic red cells, reticulocyte Hb, lactate dehydrogenase, soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR), creatinine, and urea should be determined accordingly. Some authors have also emphasized a key potential role for early markers of impaired erythropoiesis markers, such as the Hb content in reticulocytes (CHr) or reticulocyte Hb equivalent, measures that are not available as part of conventional laboratory tests and that are further discussed in the outlook section.

### Predictive role of red blood cell distribution width and hemoglobin-to-red blood cell distribution width ratio for mortality in patients with COPD: evidence from NHANES 1999–2018 [^96a0ce2b]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a heterogeneous disease characterized by persistent and progressive airway inflammation and/or emphysema. This causes airflow limitation, resulting in symptoms like coughing, mucus production, wheezing, and shortness of breath. According to statistics, COPD has become one of the top three causes of death in the world, and many patients have died from it or its complications. In 2019, more than 3.3 million people died from COPD which was the primary cause of deaths from COPD. The global burden of mortality in COPD patients remains substantial, affecting a significant number of individuals worldwide. This disease poses substantial challenges for both patients and healthcare systems, under-scoring the critical need for a comprehensive understanding of the contributing factors to improve outcomes and quality of life for affected individuals.

Red blood cell distribution width (RDW), a simple and inexpensive hematological parameter that reflects the degree of heterogeneity in red blood cell volume, has been traditionally used for the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of anemia. As a dynamic parameter responsive to internal and external stimuli, RDW levels provide a sensitive gauge of the body's homeostatic mechanisms. Clinical studies have shown that RDW is associated with various diseases and disease outcomes, and RDW is now recognized as a strong independent risk factor for mortality in the general population. Over the past 20 years, multiple studies have confirmed that patients with stable COPD and acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive disease (AECOPD) have higher RDW levels compared with healthy individual. Furthermore, some studies have confirmed that RDW is related to mortality in patients with COPD. Hemoglobin-to-red blood cell distribution width ratio (HRR) is a new combined biomarker proposed by Sun et al. in their study on the progression of non-small cell lung cancer. HRR is considered an inflammatory marker and is associated with the incidence and adverse events of a variety of diseases. However, the relationship between HRR and mortality in patients with COPD remains unclear. Furthermore, it is still unclear whether HRR is a better predictor of mortality compared to RDW in these patients.

Consequently, our primary objective is to evaluate the association of RDW and HRR with mortality in COPD patients, and to compare their predictive roles for mortality in these patients.

### Anemia in children with inflammatory bowel disease: a position paper by the IBD committee of the north American society of pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology and nutrition [^61245b85]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2020). High credibility.

Red blood cell (RBC) and reticulocyte indices — red cell size factor (RSf), RDW, and IRF: many RBC parameters are affected by the long lifespan of erythrocytes (about 120 days). RSf, defined as the square root of MCV multiplied by mean reticulocyte volume (MRV), correlates with CHr and, when low, indicates iron deficiency anemia; a level below 98.6 fL was found to be 83% sensitive and 98% specific, with positive predictive value 67% and negative predictive value 92%. High RDW combined with low RSf is highly predictive of iron deficiency, and the immature reticulocyte fraction (IRF) is an early and sensitive index of erythropoiesis useful for distinguishing increased versus decreased erythropoietic activity.

### The association between hemoglobin-to-red cell distribution width ratio and asthma and asthma exacerbations: a cross-sectional study [^dc94e031]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Asthma is a common chronic respiratory disease worldwide, characterized by reversible airway constriction and hyperresponsiveness. Analysis of the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) database indicates that in 2019, approximately 262 million people were affected by asthma, with its incidence continuing to rise. One of the most severe consequences of asthma is exacerbation, also known as an asthma attack, which results in a substantial number of emergency department visits. This imposes a significant burden on global healthcare resources and the economy. Therefore, identifying accessible, cost-effective, and highly sensitive biomarkers for asthma and its exacerbations holds significant clinical value.

Complete blood count (CBC) parameters have become valuable tools in asthma research in recent years due to their non-invasive nature, affordability, and accessibility. Among them, eosinophil count is recognized as a key biomarker of asthma-related inflammation, with elevated levels often associated with disease exacerbation and chronic inflammation. However, eosinophil count exhibits limited sensitivity at low levels, restricting its predictive utility across all asthma patients. Additionally, RDW an indicator of erythrocyte volume heterogeneity, has been linked to systemic inflammation and hypoxic conditions. Recent studies have demonstrated its association with the prevalence and mortality of several inflammatory diseases, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), rheumatic diseases, sepsis, and heart failure. Similarly, hemoglobin (HGB) primarily functions as an oxygen transport molecule and is widely used as a key biochemical marker for diagnosing anemia.

The HRR is an innovative composite biomarker that integrates HGB and RDW, providing comprehensive information on oxygen transport and inflammation. HRR was initially introduced in cancer research, and has since been demonstrated to be associated with various diseases, including cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, offering greater comprehensiveness and reliability compared to HGB or RDW alone. HRR is influenced by both its components: hemoglobin levels can be altered by anemia, chronic disease, nutritional deficiencies, or hypoxia, while RDW tends to increase under conditions of systemic inflammation, oxidative stress, or disrupted erythropoiesis. These factors make HRR a composite marker that captures both oxygen transport capacity and systemic inflammatory burden. Compared to RDW or HGB alone, HRR may offer improved stability and interpretability in reflecting chronic inflammatory conditions. Therefore, HRR may serve as an integrative marker reflecting both oxygen delivery and inflammatory burden.

Given the complex pathological characteristics of asthma and the interplay between systemic inflammation and hypoxia, we hypothesize that HRR may serve as a potential biomarker for assessing disease status in asthma patients. This study aims to analyze the relationship between HRR, asthma, and asthma exacerbations.

### Progressive rise in red cell distribution width is associated with disease progression in ambulatory patients with chronic heart failure [^5b0571b6]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Single red cell distribution width (RDW) assessment is a consistent prognostic marker of poor outcomes in heart failure as well as in other patient cohorts. The objective of this study was to determine the prognostic value of sequential RDW assessment in ambulatory patients with chronic heart failure.

Methods and Results

We reviewed 6,159 consecutive ambulatory patients with chronic heart failure between 2001–2006 and examined changes in RDW values from baseline to 1-year follow-up. Clinical, demographic, laboratory, and ICD-9 coding data were extracted from electronic health records, and all-cause mortality was followed over a mean follow-up of 4.4 ± 2.4 years. In this study cohort, median baseline RDW was 14.9%. RDW > 16% at baseline (18.5% of cohort) was associated with a higher mortality rates than RDW ≤ 16%. For each +1% increment of baseline RDW, the risk ratio for all-cause mortality was 1.17 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.15–1.19; P < .0001). At 12-month follow-up (n = 1,601), a large majority of subjects (68% in first tertile, 56% in second tertile of baseline RDW) showed rising RDW and correspondingly higher risk for all-cause mortality (risk ratio for +1% increase in changes in RDW was 1.08 (95% CI 1.03–1.13; P = 0.001). This effect was independent of anemia status or other baseline cardiac or renal indices, and particularly strong in those with lower baseline RDW.

Conclusions

In our ambulatory cohort of patients with chronic heart failure, baseline and serial increases in RDW were associated with poor long-term outcomes independently from standard cardiac, hematologic, and renal indices.

### Diagnostic value of neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, fibrinogen-to-albumin ratio and red blood cell distribution width in tuberculosis combined with other bacterial infections [^e0eaf59a]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

RDW is a parameter that reflects the heterogeneity of the red blood cell volume. Previous studies have suggested that RDW may be a laboratory indicator of infection or inflammation. Mao et al. reported that when the respiratory tract was infected by various pathogens, the RDW value would change abnormally, which was found to be related to the changes of WBC, PLT and creatinine. It has been suggested that the RDW value may reflect the course of respiratory diseases. A study by Wang et al. found that RDW may be a promising indicator for predicting severe liver inflammation in autoimmune hepatitis. And it is positively correlated with the severity of liver inflammation. This study found that the RDW value of the PTB with infection complication group was significantly higher than that of the PTB without infection complication group (P < 0.05), the RDW value of the severely ill patients in the PTB with infection complication group was higher than that of the non-severely ill patients in the PTB with infection complication group (P < 0.05). During bacterial infection, the inflammatory response is excessively activated, and a large number of pro-inflammatory factors released during this process reduce the maturation of red blood cells by inhibiting the maturation factor of red blood cells, so that a large number of immature red blood cells are released into the blood, the heterogeneity of red blood cell size is increased, and ultimately the RDW value in peripheral blood is increased. Bacterial infections can enhance oxidative stress, leading to excessive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). These ROS can damage the erythrocyte membrane, reduce its deformability, and shorten its lifespan. TB patients often experience anemia, which may be exacerbated by chronic inflammation. Chronic inflammation inhibits iron utilization by regulating hepcidin in the liver, resulting in ineffective erythropoiesis. To compensate for the loss of red blood cells, the bone marrow releases erythrocytes of varying shapes into circulation, leading to an increased RDW. In addition, the RDW value was positively correlated with CRP, DD, ESR, and FER (P < 0.05). RDW had a sensitivity of 86.5%, a specificity of 69.79%, and an AUC of 0.799 in the screening of early PTB with other bacterial infection complication. These findings suggested that RDW can be used as a potential inflammatory index to evaluate the changes of PTB with other bacterial infection complication. However, its specificity is low for early screening. Therefore, whether RDW can be used to evaluate the severity and prognosis of PTB with other bacterial infection complication requires follow-up multi-center studies, including a larger number of patients. In view of the fact that RDW is a simple, convenient, low cost and easy to detect clinical indicator, it is worth further study to determine its potential value and provide reference for clinicians.

### Determinants of red cell distribution width (RDW) in cardiorenal patients: RDW is not related to erythropoietin resistance [^5762b8cf]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Studies have shown that red cell distribution width (RDW) is related to outcome in chronic heart failure (CHF). The pathophysiological process is unknown. We studied the relationship between RDW and erythropoietin (EPO) resistance, and related factors such as erythropoietic activity, functional iron availability and hepcidin.

Methods and Results

In the Mechanisms of Erythropoietin Action in the Cardiorenal Syndrome (EPOCARES) study, which investigates the role of EPO in 54 iron-supplemented anemic patients with CHF and chronic kidney disease (CKD) (n = 35 treated with 50 IU/kg/wk Epopoetin beta, n = 19 control), RDW was not associated with EPO resistance. We defined EPO resistance by EPO levels (r = 0.12, P = 0.42), the observed/predicted log EPO ratio (r = 0.12, P = 0.42), the increase in reticulocytes after 2 weeks of EPO treatment (r = -0.18, P = 0.31), and the increase of hemoglobin after 6 months of EPO treatment (r = 0.26, P = 0.35). However, RDW was negatively correlated with functional iron availability (reticulocyte hemoglobin content, r = -0.48, P < .001, and transferrin saturation, r = -0.39, P = 0.005) and positively with erythropoietic activity (soluble transferrin receptor, r = 0.48, P < .001, immature reticulocyte fraction, r = 0.36, P = 0.01) and positively with interleukin-6 (r = 0.48, P < .001). No correlation existed between hepcidin-25 and RDW.

Conclusions

EPO resistance was not associated with RDW. RDW was associated with functional iron availability, erythropoietic activity, and interleukin-6 in anemic patients with CHF and CKD.

### Prognostic significance of red cell distribution width in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma [^5b41235d]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Red cell distribution width (RDW) is routinely assessed as part of the complete blood count (CBC) to gather information on the heterogeneity in the size of circulating erythrocytes. RDW is a more sensitive screening marker for anemia, inflammation, and nutritional deficiencies. The purpose of this study was to explore the prognostic value of RDW in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) patients.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective study of data from 148 ESCC consecutive patients who underwent potentially curative esophagectomy and analyzed the correlation of RDW with various clinicopathological factors.

Results

Multivariate analyses identified a high RDW (HR, 2.061; P = 0.0286) as a significant risk factor for cancer-specific survival (CSS). Kaplan-Meier analysis and the log-rank test demonstrated that patients with a high RDW had a significantly worse prognosis in terms of CSS than those with a low RDW (P = 0.0011). In multivariate analysis, there was no significant relationship between RDW and CSS in pathological tumor node metastasis stage I or II patients. However, a high RDW (HR, 2.386; P = 0.0471) was confirmed to be an independent worse prognostic factor for CSS in pathological tumor node metastasis stage III cancer patients. Kaplan-Meier analysis and the log-rank test showed a significant relationship between RDW and CSS in patients with pathological tumor node metastasis stage III (P = 0.0175).

Conclusions

The RDW was a significant and independent predictor of poor survival in ESCC patients after curative esophagectomy. RDW may aid clinicians in detecting signs of recurrence very early and effectively customize treatment regimens. RDW is thus a convenient, cost-effective, and readily available biomarker to predict survival in ESCC.

### Ratio of red blood cell distribution width to albumin level and risk of mortality [^60fa2984]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

The identification of new biomarkers for the early detection of increased risk of mortality remains an unmet need. There has been significant progress in establishing the epidemiology of novel blood biomarkers for all-cause and cause-specific mortality, such as serum neurofilament light chain, N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide, retinol, alpha tocopherol, and beta carotene. Despite this progress, simple, inexpensive, and reliable indicators are still essential for predicting mortality in clinical practice. At present, routine laboratory tests are widely used in primary care and hospitals, and further use of routine clinical biomarkers is expected. For example, several new biomarkers, such as the prognostic nutritional index, ratio of neutrophil to lymphocyte, and ratio of platelet to lymphocyte, were derived from routine laboratory tests. These simple integrated biomarkers showed significant associations with all-cause and cause-specific mortality in the general population. Therefore, there is still substantial interest in the use of routine biomarkers to identify persons who are at risk for mortality.

Red blood cell distribution width (RDW), a marker from routine laboratory tests, reflects the degree of heterogeneity in erythrocyte volume. Increased RDW, resulting from impaired erythropoiesis and abnormal red blood cell survival, are associated with a variety of disorders and mortality. Serum albumin, the most abundant circulating protein in the blood, is an important marker of nutritional status and the inflammatory response. The physiological properties of albumin include anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anticoagulant, and antiplatelet aggregation activities as well as colloid osmotic effects. Several studies have reported that the serum albumin concentration is inversely associated with the incidence of dysfunction, disease, and mortality. Additionally, RDW is positively correlated with chronological age, while serum albumin is negatively correlated with chronological age, and RDW and albumin are associated with phenotypic and biological age and contribute greatly to individual variances in aging pace.

### A study of red cell distribution width in neonatal sepsis [^816b72e1]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The objective of this study was to evaluate a new nontraditional value of the red cell distribution width (RDW) in predicting the clinical outcome of neonatal sepsis.

Methods

In this retrospective study, data were collected from the medical files of 500 full-term neonates with a diagnosis of early onset or late onset sepsis. Baseline RDW and other traditional biomarkers, including C-reactive protein (CRP), total leucocytic count, and platelet count were analyzed in light of the clinical data. The primary outcome was 30-day mortality.

Results

Red cell distribution width was significantly higher in nonsurvivors compared with survivors (P < 0.0001). Red cell distribution width was significantly elevated in infants with septic shock compared with those having severe sepsis and those with sepsis (P < 0.0001). A strong positive correlation was found between RDW and CRP (r = 0.8; P < 0.0001). Red cell distribution width had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.75 for prediction of mortality, which was almost equal to that of CRP and platelet count. Furthermore, logistic regression analysis showed a positive association of RDW with mortality (odds ratio, 1.31; 95% confidence interval, 1.241–1.399).

Conclusions

Red cell distribution width is a useful prognostic marker in neonatal sepsis. Larger prospective studies are required to confirm the value of this routinely available marker in this category of patients.

### Usefulness of red cell width distribution (RDW) in the assessment of children with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) [^8a606da1]. Pediatric Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Red cell width distribution (RDW) is known to be a prognostic marker in adults with pulmonary hypertension. The value of this test in the pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) pediatric population was not yet established. The aim of the study was to evaluate the prognostic value of RDW in children with PAH and utility of this parameter in the management. Data were collected retrospectively in 61 patients with PAH confirmed by right heart catheterization. RDW was measured at diagnosis, 3 and 12 months after initial therapy, during and after deterioration if occurred. Results were compared with NTproBNP, WHO-FC and oxygen blood saturation. Mean RDW at baseline was 15.3 ± 2.4% (12.1–24.4, median 14.7%) and was elevated in 29 patients (47%). There were no significant difference in clinical status, NTproBNP and hemodynamic parameters among patient with normal and elevated RDW at diagnosis. Poor negative correlation with SaO 2 and SvO 2 was shown. After 3 and 12 months of treatment no significant change of RDW level was found despite of statistically significant improvement of WHO-FC and decrease of NTproBNP level (NS). Episodes of clinical deterioration weren't connected with change of RDW level (16 vs. 15.6% NS). Kaplan-Meier analysis did not show differences in prognosis between patients with normal and elevated RDW. Elevation of RDW was not associated with any measured parameters. Prognostic value of RDW in the pediatric PAH population was not confirmed. Usefulness of RDW in management in PAH pediatric population is limited and required further studies.

### Automated blood cell counts: state of the art [^aa47e194]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2008). Low credibility.

The CBC count and leukocyte differential count (LDC) are among the most frequently requested clinical laboratory tests. These analyses are highly automated, and the correct interpretation of results requires extensive knowledge of the analytic performance of the instruments and the clinical significance of the results they provide. In this review, we analyze the state of the art regarding traditional and new parameters with emphasis on clinical applications and analytic quality. The problems of some traditional parameters of the CBC count, such as platelet counts, some components of the LDC such as monocyte and basophil counts, and other commonly used indices such as red cell volume distribution width and platelet indices such as mean platelet volume and platelet distribution width are considered. The new parameters, evaluated from analytic and clinical viewpoints, are the available components of the extended differential count (hematopoietic progenitor cells, immature granulocytes, and erythroblasts), the immature reticulocyte fraction, the reticulocyte indices, the fragmented RBCs, and the immature platelet fraction.

### Practical guidance for the management of iron deficiency in patients with inflammatory bowel disease [^f2fbd075]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Diagnosis of iron deficiency without anemia

Iron deficiency with relevant clinical symptoms can be present even before anemia develops as a long-term consequence. In such cases, early changes in the CBC, for example an increased RDW or an MCH close to the lower limit of normal, can represent early manifestations of iron deficiency. As described above, the reticulocyte count can be decreased even before erythrocyte indices are affected. Iron storage indices can also be interpreted in a similar way as in the diagnosis of IDA: in patients with IBD and no clinical, endoscopic or biochemical sign of active disease, a ferritin level below 15–30 μg/liter is diagnostic for iron deficiency. In the case of active disease, a ferritin level up to 100 μg/liter can still be consistent with iron deficiency. A TfS below 20% reflects a reduced availability of iron for erythropoiesis, either due to total iron deficiency or due to functional iron deficiency (e.g. in chronic inflammation or following treatment with erythropoietin). It was suggested that a TfS below 20% with a ferritin below 100 μg/liter defines total iron deficiency. A TfS below 20% and a ferritin above 100 μg/liter were defined as functional iron deficiency. In otherwise unclear cases, sTfR can also be useful.

### Red cell distribution width as a potential new biomarker to predict the clinical severity of acute diverticulitis [^3b95f303]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Despite the high patient count and broad inclusion of subjects, the results have limited generalizability particularly to different Hinchey classes, as we were able to analyze only two groups based on this classification (class I versus class II-IV). The retrospective design limits the reliability of some data that were based on hospital records (in spite of the fact that these were electronic records) and retrospective analysis precludes the inclusion of additional biomarkers, clinical variables, and long-term outcomes such as recurrence, complications, and mortality. If a group of patients with diverticulosis had been included, the results of patients with diverticulitis could have been compared to these patients to understand the variations between these groups and the utility of examined parameters in distinguishing cases. Potential confounders that could affect RDW levels, such as iron deficiency, anemia, chronic diseases, malnutrition or other factors, were not evaluated. While we excluded patients with known comorbidities, we did not have access to laboratory data on iron status, renal function, or nutritional markers — all of which may affect RDW. This limitation should be kept in mind when interpreting our results. The exclusion of these factors may represent a limitation in the interpretation of the results. Additionally, the considerable differences in patient numbers between treatment groups may have affected the reliability of statistical comparisons in this regard. Additionally, since this study only included patients with confirmed diverticulitis, we were not able to compare RDW levels to those of a healthy or non-diverticulitis population. This limits our ability to define a general reference range or threshold for RDW in broader clinical settings.

### Red blood cell distribution width as a prognostic marker in patients with heart failure and diabetes mellitus [^e5cb7dac]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2017). Low credibility.

The presence of anemia is associated with a special risk in patients with any form of proatherosclerotic condition and heart disease. Despite the fact that clinical and hemodynamical changes due to acute, short-lasting anemia are reversible, chronic anemia can lead to cardiac enlargement and left ventricular hypertrophy due to volume overload. Anemia is considered to be a mediator and a marker of a poor outcome in HF, a risk factor for ischemic heart disease, and often coexists in patients with acute coronary syndromes. Notably, in patients with stable coronary artery disease, higher RDW is a strong and independent prognostic marker of mortality. In our study, RDW was an independent, to anemia, prognostic factor for death or rehospitalization.

Study limitations

The sample size of diabetic patients that enrolled in the study was not large (71 patients), albeit every patient not met the study endpoint, had five measurements (admission, discharge, 4, 8 and 12 months). This means that the results should be interpreted under caution and used as a basis for larger studies.

Future directions

Subclinical chronic inflammation is a common feature in the natural course of diabetes and levels of inflammatory biomarkers show promising results regarding this correlation. We strongly believe that the design of larger studies with main focus on "specific" markers of inflammation (such as Leptin, TNF, IL-6, CCL2, Resistin, Adiponectin) and the association with RDW would be of particular importance.

### Could the erythrocyte indices or serum ferritin predict the therapeutic response to a trial with oral iron during pregnancy? Results from the accuracy study for maternal anaemia diagnosis (AMA) [^c6570075]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2016). Low credibility.

Methods

This is a prospective validation study on phase III, whose index-tests were the pre-treatment values of serum ferritin, red blood cell count, Hb, HTC, MCV, MCH, MCHC, RDW and reticulocyte count, and reference standard was the responsiveness to a therapeutic test with oral iron. This report was made according to the requirements of the Standards for Reporting of Diagnostic Accuracy Initiative. The validation studies on phase III are conducted with a population in whom it is clinically sensible to suspect the target disease in a pragmatic real-world setting of routine clinical practice. Thereby, this study was conducted at a single pre-natal care center and compared the diagnostic tests in pregnant women previously classified as anemic, as they are under higher risk of iron-deficiency.

This study followed the ethics principles in research with human beings of the World Medical Association's Declaration of Helsinki, and was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of IMIP (registration number 2050/10). Each participant was oriented, read and signed the consent form prior to their inclusion in the study. As we applied a before-after intervention with medicinal iron, our protocol was inscribed in International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (U1111-1123-2605) of WHO, and in Brazilian Registry of Clinical Trials (RBR-237 registered 28 July 2011, available at:).

Participants and follow-up

Pregnant women attended at the prenatal care center of Instituto de Medicina Integral Prof Fernando Figueira (IMIP) were consecutively recruited based on a Hb value < 11 g/dL (WHO criteria for anaemia) in the routinely prenatal exams plus the following inclusion criteria: 18 to 35 years old, 12 th to 32 nd weeks of low-risk singleton pregnancy. Our prenatal service composes of the reference network assistance for pregnant women in the public health system in the state of Pernambuco, in the Northeast of Brazil, and performs an average of 17,000 outpatient consultations and 6,000 deliveries per year. The exclusion criteria were Hb ≤ 7.0 g/dL, history of hypersensitivity or intolerance to ferrous sulfate, disorders or mental deficits; use of tobacco, alcohol or other drugs; previous diagnosis of another cause of anaemia; or infection at the time of the enrollment (positive serology for Human Immunodeficiency Virus or syphilis, leukocytosis or leukocyturia with positive urine culture, clinical signs and symptoms of airway infection).
