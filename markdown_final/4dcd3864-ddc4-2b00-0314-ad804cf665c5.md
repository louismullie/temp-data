## Question

Nt pro BNP guided therapy

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether NT-proBNP–guided therapy improves outcomes in heart failure and how to apply the evidence in practice. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and the exact PICO framing. Then, I should appraise the highest-quality randomized trial (GUIDE-IT) and its limitations. Next, I will integrate meta-analyses and subgroup data, including age, ejection fraction, and comorbidities. After that, I should review guideline positions and reconcile them with mechanistic and implementation issues. Finally, I will translate this into a practical, risk-stratified recommendation with caveats about ARNI use, obesity, and renal function, and outline a monitoring approach that leverages prognostic value without overpromising therapeutic guidance.

> Let me first confirm the clinical question and scope. NT-proBNP–guided therapy refers to serial measurement of NT-proBNP with explicit treatment titration targets to reduce morbidity and mortality in heart failure, typically HFrEF, compared with usual care guided by symptoms and clinical judgment. I need to ensure I distinguish diagnostic and prognostic uses from therapeutic guidance, because guidelines endorse the former but remain cautious about the latter [^7340bbfb] [^362f6f2d].

> Next, I should review the pivotal evidence. The GUIDE-IT randomized trial in high-risk HFrEF patients tested a strategy targeting NT-proBNP less than 1000 pg/mL versus usual care and was stopped early for futility, with no difference in the composite of HF hospitalization or cardiovascular death and no difference in achieved NT-proBNP levels between arms, despite protocolized follow-up and encouragement to intensify GDMT [^93cb2641]. Wait, let me verify the implementation details, because therapeutic inertia could blunt effects. Indeed, a secondary analysis showed that many patients did not reach optimal GDMT and that both arms had similar intensification, which likely attenuated any signal from biomarker guidance [^6076c257].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions from a single trial. I should integrate meta-analyses. Multiple systematic reviews and meta-analyses suggest that natriuretic peptide–guided therapy may reduce HF hospitalizations and, in some analyses, all-cause mortality, but the effect sizes are modest and heterogeneity is substantial, with sensitivity analyses often attenuating significance when restricted to low-bias studies or when GUIDE-IT is included [^1f93ebbe] [^391594a5] [^da133555]. I should double-check that these analyses also flag limitations such as open-label designs, varying targets, and differing baseline care, which they do, reinforcing that the net clinical benefit remains uncertain despite pooled signals of benefit [^1f93ebbe] [^391594a5].

> I will now examine subgroup effects, because they may refine applicability. Individual patient meta-analyses and subgroup analyses suggest benefit is concentrated in younger patients, generally under 75 years, and in HFrEF rather than HFpEF, with signals of harm or neutrality in older adults and those with multiple comorbidities. TIME-CHF long-term follow-up also showed improved HF hospitalization-free survival in patients 60–74 but not in those 75 and older [^fb36e46f] [^09b63e13]. Let me reconsider whether HFpEF truly shows harm; TIME-CHF suggested worse outcomes with NT-proBNP guidance in HFpEF, so I should be cautious about extrapolating to preserved EF phenotypes [^fb8a3795].

> Next, I should review guideline positions to ensure alignment. Contemporary guidelines give NT-proBNP/BNP a Class I role for diagnosis, prognosis, and risk stratification, and allow that serial measurements may inform prognosis and adherence discussions, but they do not endorse routine NT-proBNP–guided titration as standard of care. ACC/AHA/HFSA gives a cautious Class IIa for using biomarkers to achieve GDMT dosing in select euvolemic patients within structured programs, whereas ESC guidance emphasizes uncertainty and does not recommend serial monitoring to guide therapy [^7340bbfb] [^362f6f2d] [^fa374a02]. I need to ensure I capture that this reflects the mixed and largely neutral high-quality trial data, especially GUIDE-IT, which shifted the balance toward uncertainty [^c0523a54].

> But wait, what if the lack of benefit in GUIDE-IT reflects mechanistic or implementation issues rather than a flawed concept. Let me think about confounders: ARNI therapy lowers NT-proBNP and improves outcomes, yet BNP rises with neprilysin inhibition, so NT-proBNP is preferred for monitoring in ARNI-treated patients; obesity lowers natriuretic peptide levels, so fixed thresholds may misclassify risk; and renal dysfunction elevates NT-proBNP, complicating targets and interpretation [^5d3b1b47] [^39f49376] [^37e44b52]. I should confirm that serial NT-proBNP remains prognostically informative despite these issues; indeed, repeated measurements track risk and can precede events, supporting prognostic use even if therapeutic guidance remains unproven [^3b05784b] [^9c43923d].

> I will now translate this into a practical approach. First, do not replace GDMT with biomarker targets; prioritize evidence-based therapy uptitration to maximally tolerated doses, using NT-proBNP as an adjunct for risk stratification and to identify patients at higher risk who may benefit from closer follow-up or more aggressive titration when safe [^7340bbfb] [^b555d6bd]. Second, in patients under 75 with HFrEF, it is reasonable to consider NT-proBNP–guided intensification within a structured disease management program, recognizing potential but unproven benefit and the need to avoid overtreatment in frail or multimorbid patients [^fa374a02] [^fb36e46f]. Third, in ARNI-treated patients, prefer NT-proBNP for monitoring and interpret BNP cautiously due to neprilysin effects [^5d3b1b47] [^37e44b52]. Fourth, in obesity or CKD, individualize interpretation using patient-specific baselines and relative changes rather than rigid thresholds, and consider that achieving NT-proBNP less than 1000 pg/mL correlates with reverse remodeling and better outcomes even if the strategy to get there was not superior in trials [^5f0efef0] [^69c59905].

> Let me outline a monitoring cadence that leverages prognostic value without overpromising guidance. Baseline NT-proBNP establishes risk; during active GDMT titration, checking every 1–3 months can help track response and identify nonresponders; once stable, periodic checks every 6–12 months or with clinical change are reasonable, with a 30% relative change from baseline or from the patient's own "dry" value considered clinically meaningful given biological variability and prognostic gradients [^b555d6bd] [^192d9354]. I should confirm that discharge and early follow-up NT-proBNP carry prognostic information; yes, predischarge and 90–180 day values strongly predict death or HF hospitalization, so documenting these can inform follow-up intensity and patient counseling [^7340bbfb] [^69c59905].

> In summary, I need to ensure the bottom line is precise: NT-proBNP–guided therapy has not consistently improved hard outcomes in high-quality contemporary trials, particularly GUIDE-IT, so it should not replace guideline-directed care. However, meta-analytic signals of reduced HF hospitalizations and possible mortality benefit in selected younger HFrEF patients, together with the strong prognostic value of serial NT-proBNP, support using NT-proBNP to risk-stratify, flag high-risk patients, and occasionally augment intensification within structured programs, while avoiding overinterpretation in older adults, those with multiple comorbidities, or HFpEF where harm cannot be excluded [^93cb2641] [^1f93ebbe] [^391594a5] [^fb36e46f] [^7340bbfb].

---

NT-proBNP–guided therapy is **not routinely recommended** for heart failure management because large, high-quality trials (e.g. GUIDE-IT) show no improvement in hard outcomes versus usual care [^93cb2641]. While some meta-analyses suggest fewer heart failure hospitalizations, effects on mortality are inconsistent and overall evidence quality is low [^1f93ebbe] [^391594a5]. NT-proBNP remains valuable for diagnosis and prognosis, and serial measurements can inform risk, but **should not replace symptom-guided titration of guideline-directed medical therapy** [^7340bbfb] [^362f6f2d]. Use NT-proBNP to support clinical judgment, especially in younger HFrEF patients with fewer comorbidities, and avoid relying on fixed thresholds in obesity, renal dysfunction, or HFpEF [^fb36e46f] [^39f49376] [^5d3b1b47] [^fb8a3795].

## Clinical evidence for NT-proBNP–guided therapy

### Major randomized controlled trials

- **GUIDE-IT trial**: 894 HFrEF patients; NT-proBNP–guided therapy targeting < 1,000 pg/mL vs usual care showed no difference in HF hospitalization or cardiovascular death (37% vs 37%; HR 0.98, 95% CI 0.79–1.22) [^93cb2641].
- **PRIMA study**: Individualized NT-proBNP targets did not improve days alive outside hospital vs clinical care (685 vs 664 days; p = 0.49) [^0e5df755].
- **PRIMA II (ADHF)**: Targeting ≥ 30% NT-proBNP reduction did not improve 6-month outcomes vs usual care [^352e10ef].

---

### Meta-analyses and systematic reviews

Meta-analyses show a **modest reduction in HF hospitalizations** (RR 0.70–0.80) but inconsistent effects on mortality, with low-to-moderate evidence quality and heterogeneity in targets, algorithms, and populations [^1f93ebbe] [^391594a5]. Overall, **routine NT-proBNP–guided therapy is not supported** for improving hard outcomes [^c0523a54].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Current guidelines reflect the **neutral trial data**:

- **ACC/AHA/HFSA 2022**: Class IIa for BNP/NT-proBNP to achieve GDMT dosing in select euvolemic patients within structured programs; not routine care [^fa374a02] [^304ed90e].
- **ESC 2021**: Recommends NT-proBNP for diagnosis/prognosis; does not endorse routine therapy guidance [^362f6f2d].
- **Trilateral consensus 2023**: States efficacy for treatment guidance remains unestablished; use for risk stratification and prognosis only [^c0523a54].

---

## Patient populations benefiting from NT-proBNP–guided therapy

Subgroup analyses suggest **potential benefit in younger HFrEF patients** with fewer comorbidities, whereas older adults with multimorbidity do not benefit and may have more adverse effects [^fb36e46f] [^09b63e13]. In HFpEF, **NT-proBNP–guided therapy is not beneficial** and may worsen outcomes, so it is not recommended [^fb8a3795].

---

## Limitations and challenges

- **Biological variability**: 25–30% for NT-proBNP complicates fixed thresholds [^1002fbde].
- **Comorbidities**: Renal dysfunction, obesity, and atrial fibrillation alter NT-proBNP levels and limit guidance utility [^39f49376] [^5d3b1c47].
- **Therapeutic inertia**: Many patients fail to reach GDMT despite protocols, limiting biomarker-guided benefit [^6076c257].

---

## Practical clinical application

NT-proBNP is best used as an **adjunct to clinical judgment**:

- **Diagnosis and prognosis**: Strong Class I evidence for diagnosis, risk stratification, and prognosis [^7340bbfb] [^362f6f2d].
- **Serial monitoring**: Helpful to track risk and guide follow-up intensity, but not to dictate therapy changes [^5b136260] [^3b05784b].
- **ARNI context**: Prefer NT-proBNP over BNP because neprilysin increases BNP; interpret BNP cautiously [^5d3b1c47] [^37e44b52].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

NT-proBNP–guided therapy is **not routinely recommended** because high-quality trials show no outcome benefit; however, NT-proBNP remains useful for diagnosis and prognosis. Consider NT-proBNP to support GDMT optimization in younger HFrEF patients with fewer comorbidities, and avoid fixed thresholds in obesity, renal dysfunction, or HFpEF. Always prioritize symptom-guided, evidence-based therapy titration [^7340bbfb] [^362f6f2d].

### Natriuretic peptides in heart failure: should therapy be guided by BNP levels? [^3fca4ed9]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2010). Medium credibility.

Heart failure (HF) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Testing for natriuretic peptide markers, such as B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) or N-terminal proBNP (NT-proBNP), has emerged as an important tool for the diagnosis and risk stratification of patients with HF. However, questions remain regarding the potential role for natriuretic peptides to guide therapy in patients with HF. In this Review, we address the underlying assumptions and the existing evidence supporting a natriuretic-peptide-guided approach to the outpatient management of HF.

### NT-proBNP and BNP: biomarkers for heart failure management [^df437df3]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2004). Low credibility.

Guidelines for the pharmacological treatment of heart failure (HF) are based on results from large clinical trials demonstrating benefit. State of the art pharmacological management of HF assumes that target doses should be the same as those used in trials. Thus equal doses are recommended for all in practical guidelines, but this strategy might not fit individual needs. NT-proBNP and BNP emerged as potential biomarkers of clinical interest in HF management. NT-proBNP and BNP are related to HF severity and to clinical status. NT-proBNP and BNP are strongly associated with prognosis across the whole spectrum of HF patients. A pilot study has shown that NT-proBNP-guided therapy is associated with improved outcome in HF. Although at present there are still few data to make firm recommendations on the use of NT-proBNP or BNP levels as biomarkers for HF management, future studies will provide further insight on this issue.

### Use of NT-proBNP testing to guide heart failure therapy… [^cb830ef6]. ClinicalTrials (2006). Low credibility.

It remains unclear, however, whether treating patients based on their NT-proBNP concentrations would be associated with better outcomes compared to standard HF therapy without measurement of NT-proBNP values. The goal of the PROTECT study is to evaluate whether treatment of patients with advanced and recently destabilized HF would benefit from NT-proBNP guided HF treatment, compared to standard HF therapy without such 'hormone guided' treatment. 300 patients with class II-IV heart failure due to systolic dysfunction and recent destabilized HF will be randomized 1: 1 to either 'standard of care' therapy for their HF versus 'standard of care plus NT-proBNP guided' care.

Patients randomized to the 'standard of care' arm of the study will receive aggressive therapy for their HF, including evidence-based addition/titration of therapeutic agents in the trial, such as carvedilol or metoprolol XL, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers, spironolactone inhibitors, digoxin, loop diuretics, as well as nitrates with or without hydralazine. Biventricular pacing with/without ICD capability will be performed at the discretion of the investigator. Any changes in therapy will be accompanied by a 2 week follow up for re-assessment and further titration of medications, based on clinical judgment. At each interim visit, patients in the 'standard of care' arm will have a Minnesota Living with Heart Failure questionnaire taken.

For all visits, including those triggered by med changes, laboratories will be checked including serum chemistries; a sample of blood for blinded NT-proBNP, troponin T, and high sensitivity CRP will be obtained for measurement after the trial is complete. Patients randomized to the 'standard of care plus NT-proBNP guided' arm will receive the same aggressive medical care as above, but will also have an unblinded measurement of NT-proBNP provided to the study investigator within an hour of first patient contact. Therapeutic decision-making will be first based on clinical acumen/judgment, but if the NT-proBNP is elevated, per protocol, the investigator will adjust therapies accordingly, including escalation of existing therapies with known effects on NT-proBNP levels, as well as possible addition of similar therapies not yet in use.

### Natriuretic peptide-guided heart failure management [^b4cca195]. European Heart Journal (2014). Low credibility.

The natriuretic peptides are important tools to establish diagnosis and prognosis in heart failure (HF). With application of therapies for HF, changes in both B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and its amino terminal cleavage fragment (NT-proBNP) parallel the benefits of the HF therapy applied. This dynamic nature of BNP and NT-proBNP relative to therapeutic intervention in HF has led to the concept of using the biomarkers as a 'guide' for intensification of HF care with a goal of not only achieving guideline-directed medical therapy goals accompanied by targeted natriuretic peptide suppression below prognostic thresholds. In studies achieving this combination of therapy optimization and BNP/NT-proBNP suppression, superior outcomes have been observed, and the approach was well tolerated. Natriuretic peptide-guided HF therapy has recently been given a recommendation in US HF guidelines to achieve guideline-directed medical therapy (Class IIa) and possibly improve outcome (Class IIb), while other clinical practice guidelines (including those from the European Society of Cardiology) await results from emerging clinical trial data. We will review lessons learned in the past regarding this novel concept of biomarker guided HF care, and discuss future directions for the approach.

### Effect of natriuretic peptide-guided therapy on hospitalization or cardiovascular mortality in high-risk patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction: a randomized clinical trial [^93cb2641]. JAMA (2017). Excellent credibility.

Importance

The natriuretic peptides are biochemical markers of heart failure (HF) severity and predictors of adverse outcomes. Smaller studies have evaluated adjusting HF therapy based on natriuretic peptide levels ("guided therapy") with inconsistent results.

Objective

To determine whether an amino-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP)-guided treatment strategy improves clinical outcomes vs usual care in high-risk patients with HF and reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF).

Design, Settings, and Participants

The Guiding Evidence Based Therapy Using Biomarker Intensified Treatment in Heart Failure (GUIDE-IT) study was a randomized multicenter clinical trial conducted between January 16, 2013, and September 20, 2016, at 45 clinical sites in the United States and Canada. This study planned to randomize 1100 patients with HFrEF (ejection fraction ≤ 40%), elevated natriuretic peptide levels within the prior 30 days, and a history of a prior HF event (HF hospitalization or equivalent) to either an NT-proBNP-guided strategy or usual care.

Interventions

Patients were randomized to either an NT-proBNP-guided strategy or usual care. Patients randomized to the guided strategy (n = 446) had HF therapy titrated with the goal of achieving a target NT-proBNP of less than 1000 pg/mL. Patients randomized to usual care (n = 448) had HF care in accordance with published guidelines, with emphasis on titration of proven neurohormonal therapies for HF. Serial measurement of NT-proBNP testing was discouraged in the usual care group.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary end point was the composite of time-to-first HF hospitalization or cardiovascular mortality. Prespecified secondary end points included all-cause mortality, total hospitalizations for HF, days alive and not hospitalized for cardiovascular reasons, the individual components on the primary end point, and adverse events.

Results

The data and safety monitoring board recommended stopping the study for futility when 894 (median age, 63 years; 286 [32%] women) of the planned 1100 patients had been enrolled with follow-up for a median of 15 months. The primary end point occurred in 164 patients (37%) in the biomarker-guided group and 164 patients (37%) in the usual care group (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 0.98; 95% CI, 0.79–1.22; P = 0.88). Cardiovascular mortality was 12% (n = 53) in the biomarker-guided group and 13% (n = 57) in the usual care group (HR, 0.94; 95% CI; 0.65–1.37; P = 0.75). None of the secondary end points nor the decreases in the NT-proBNP levels achieved differed significantly between groups.

Conclusions and Relevance

In high-risk patients with HFrEF, a strategy of NT-proBNP-guided therapy was not more effective than a usual care strategy in improving outcomes.

### Guiding and monitoring of heart failure therapy with NT-proBNP: concepts and clinical studies [^995731f7]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Since 1988 with the discovery of B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), many reports have confirmed the elevation of plasma BNP in symptomatic heart failure and confirmed that plasma levels are an independent predictor of death and cardiovascular events in both acute and chronic heart failure.

Methods and Results

A more slender evidence base attests that knowledge of plasma BNP levels can be used to produce clinical benefit. One randomized controlled trial demonstrated that measurements of N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) can be used to improve diagnostic accuracy in patients with heart failure in the community. A second study demonstrated that the provision of plasma BNP data improves the speed of diagnosis and reduces the rates of hospital admission and length of hospital stay (while reducing the costs of care) in patients with heart failure who are seen the emergency department with acute dyspnea. Finally, a randomized controlled pilot study demonstrated that serial measurements of NT-proBNP can be used to more effectively optimize heart failure pharmacotherapy with a concomitant improvement in outcome.

Conclusion

The large body of observational data, coupled with this small but promising evidence base from controlled trials (which attests to beneficial effects on clinical outcomes) encourages an optimistic outlook for the further implementation of plasma BNP and/or NT-proBNP in the diagnosis and treatment of acute and chronic heart failure.

### NT-proBNP (N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide)-guided therapy in acute decompensated heart failure: PRIMA II randomized controlled trial (can NT-proBNP-guided therapy during hospital admission for acute decompensated heart failure reduce mortality and readmissions?) [^352e10ef]. Circulation (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The concept of natriuretic peptide guidance has been extensively studied in patients with chronic heart failure (HF), with only limited success. The effect of NT-proBNP (N-terminal probrain natriuretic peptide)-guided therapy in patients with acute decompensated HF using a relative NT-proBNP target has not been investigated. This study aimed to assess whether NT-proBNP-guided therapy of patients with acute decompensated HF using a relative NT-proBNP target would lead to improved outcomes compared with conventional therapy.

Methods

We conducted a prospective randomized controlled trial to study the impact of in-hospital guidance for acute decompensated HF treatment by a predefined NT-proBNP target (> 30% reduction from admission to discharge) versus conventional treatment. Patients with acute decompensated HF with NT-proBNP levels > 1700 ng/L were eligible. After achieving clinical stability, 405 patients were randomized to either NT-proBNP-guided or conventional treatment (1:1). The primary end point was dual: a composite of all-cause mortality and HF readmissions in 180 days and the number of days alive out of the hospital in 180 days. Secondary end points were all-cause mortality within 180 days, HF readmissions within 180 days, and a composite of all-cause mortality and HF readmissions within 90 days.

Results

Significantly more patients in the NT-proBNP-guided therapy group were discharged with an NT-proBNP reduction of > 30% (80% versus 64%, P = 0.001). Nonetheless, NT-proBNP-guided therapy did not significantly improve the combined event rate for all-cause mortality and HF readmissions (hazard ratio, 0.96; 95% confidence interval, 0.72–1.37; P = 0.99) or the median number of days alive outside of the hospital (178 versus 179 days for NT-proBNP versus conventional patients, P = 0.39). Guided therapy also did not significantly improve any of the secondary end points.

Conclusions

The PRIMA II trial (Can NT-ProBNP-Guided Therapy During Hospital Admission for Acute Decompensated Heart Failure Reduce Mortality and Readmissions?) demonstrates that the guidance of HF therapy to reach an NT-proBNP reduction of > 30% after clinical stabilization did not improve 6-month outcomes.

### Heart failure outcomes and benefits of NT-proBNP-guided management in the elderly: results from the prospective, randomized proBNP outpatient tailored chronic heart failure therapy (PROTECT) study [^7119b24a]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Elderly patients with heart failure (HF) have a worse prognosis than younger patients. We wished to study whether elders benefit from natriuretic peptide-guided HF care in this single-center study.

Methods and Results

A total of 151 patients with HF resulting from left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD) were treated with HF treatment by standard-of-care (SOC) management or guided by N-terminal pro-B type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) values (with a goal to lower NT-proBNP ≤ 1000 pg/mL) over 10 months. The primary end point for this post-hoc analysis was total cardiovascular events in 2 age categories (< 75 and ≥ 75 years). In those ≥ 75 years of age (n = 38), NT-proBNP values increased in the SOC arm (2570 to 3523 pg/mL, P = 0.01), but decreased in the NT-proBNP-guided arm (2664 to 1418 pg/mL, P = 0.001). Elderly patients treated with SOC management had the highest rate of cardiovascular events, whereas the elderly with NT-proBNP management had the lowest rate of cardiovascular events (1.76 events per patient versus 0.71 events per patient, P = 0.03); the adjusted logistic odds for cardiovascular events related to NT-proBNP-guided care for elders was 0.24 (P = 0.008), whereas in those < 75 years (n = 113), the adjusted logistic odds for events following NT-proBNP-guided care was 0.61 (P = 0.10).

Conclusions

Natriuretic peptide-guided HF care was well tolerated and resulted in substantial improvement in cardiovascular event rates in elders (ClinicalTrials. Gov #00351390).

### Natriuretic peptides: role in the diagnosis and management of heart failure: a scientific statement from the heart failure association of the European Society of Cardiology, Heart Failure Society of America and Japanese heart failure society [^c0523a54]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2023). High credibility.

Therapeutic use — measurement of natriuretic peptides is guideline-endorsed, but BNP-guided treatment has mixed outcome effects; in GUIDE-IT, NT-proBNP-guided therapy did not improve outcomes versus usual care, and target attainment of NT-proBNP < 1000 pg/mL was similar between arms. Guidelines "provide a Class I recommendation for measuring BNP or NT-proBNP for diagnosis or prognosis assessment in the management of chronic HF", and the GUIDE-IT multicenter randomized trial in high-risk HFrEF compared NT-proBNP-guided therapy with optimal medical therapy but "failed to show a benefit of NT-proBNP-guided therapy over usual care", with "no significant difference in the proportions of patients achieving the target of NT-proBNP < 1000 pg/mL at 12 months". A GUIDE-IT substudy found that "patients with NT-proBNP levels less than 1000 pg/mL 90 days after randomization had better outcomes, regardless of achieved GDMT". Contemporary guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) additions — "ARNIs, sodium-glucose transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors and ivabradine" — have shown clinical benefit accompanied by "reductions in NT-proBNP/BNP levels".

### Natriuretic peptides: role in the diagnosis and management of heart failure: a scientific statement from the heart failure association of the European Society of Cardiology, Heart Failure Society of America and Japanese heart failure society [^0b19b028]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2023). High credibility.

Natriuretic peptide–guided therapy in acute decompensated heart failure — evidence summary indicates limited benefit for target-based reduction: Results of the PRIMA II trial demonstrated that NT-proBNP–guided therapy targeting an NT-proBNP reduction of ≥ 30% did not improve 6-month clinical outcomes. Observational data reported that 37%–47% of patients did not achieve the targeted BNP reduction of 30% despite inpatient therapy for acute decompensated heart failure, and failure to reach the targeted threshold for BNP improvement was associated with significantly increased risk of mortality. In a recent study, 44% of admitted patients did not achieve the 30% target BNP threshold and were at significantly increased risk for 180-day mortality compared to patients whose BNP levels responded to treatment.

### N-terminal pro brain natriuretic peptide-guided management in patients with heart failure and preserved ejection fraction: findings from the trial of intensified versus standard medical therapy in elderly patients with congestive heart failure (TIME-CHF) [^fb8a3795]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2013). Low credibility.

Aims

To assess the effects of an NT-proBNP-guided medical management on 18-month outcomes in patients with heart failure (HF) and preserved LVEF (HFpEF).

Methods and Results

Patients with HFpEF (LVEF > 45%; n = 123) and HF with reduced LVEF (HFrEF; LVEF ≤ 45%; n = 499) with age ≥ 60 years, NYHA class ≥ II, and elevated NT-proBNP (> 400 ng/L or > 800 ng/L depending on age) were randomized to medical therapy titrated only to reduce symptoms to NYHA ≤ II (symptom-guided) or also to reduce NT-proBNP below the inclusion threshold (NT-proBNP-guided) during a 6-month period. Patients were followed for an additional 12 months. Despite similar treatment escalation, NT-proBNP reduction and symptom relief were less in HFpEF than in HFrEF. Hospitalization-free survival at 18 months was worse in HFpEF than in HFrEF (P = 0.02), while survival and HF hospitalization-free survival did not differ. Among HFpEF patients, NT-proBNP reduction and symptom relief were similar in the symptom-guided (n = 59) and NT-proBNP-guided (n = 64) group despite more aggressive treatment in the NT-proBNP-guided group. In contrast to effects in HFrEF, NT-proBNP-guided management tended to worsen 18-month outcomes in HFpEF, with P-values for the interactions between LVEF stratum and management strategy of 0.2 for hospitalization-free survival, 0.03 for survival, and 0.01 for HF hospitalization-free survival.

Conclusions

Outcomes in HFpEF were not better than in HFrEF, and opposite effects of NT-proBNP-guided management were observed in HFpEF compared with HFrEF. These preliminary findings suggest that, in contrast to HFrEF, NT-proBNP-guided therapy may not be beneficial in HFpEF. Trial registration ISRCTN43596477.

### Management of chronic heart failure guided by individual N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide targets: results of the PRIMA (can PRo-brain-natriuretic peptide guided therapy of chronic heart failure IMprove heart fAilure morbidity and mortality?) study [^0e5df755]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2010). Low credibility.

Objectives

The purpose of this study was to assess whether management of heart failure (HF) guided by an individualized N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) target would lead to improved outcome compared with HF management guided by clinical assessment alone.

Background

Natriuretic peptides may be attractive biomarkers to guide management of heart failure (HF) and help select patients in need of more aggressive therapy. The PRIMA (Can PRo-brain-natriuretic peptide guided therapy of chronic heart failure IMprove heart fAilure morbidity and mortality?) study is, to our knowledge, the first large, prospective randomized study to address whether management of HF guided by an individualized target NT-proBNP level improves outcome.

Methods

A total of 345 patients hospitalized for decompensated, symptomatic HF with elevated NT-proBNP levels at admission were included. After discharge, patients were randomized to either clinically-guided outpatient management (n = 171), or management guided by an individually set NT-proBNP (n = 174) defined by the lowest level at discharge or 2 weeks thereafter. The primary end point was defined as number of days alive outside the hospital after index admission.

Results

HF management guided by this individualized NT-proBNP target increased the use of HF medication (p = 0.006), and 64% of HF-related events were preceded by an increase in NT-proBNP. Nevertheless, HF management guided by this individualized NT-proBNP target did not significantly improve the primary end point (685 vs. 664 days, p = 0.49), nor did it significantly improve any of the secondary end points. In the NT-proBNP-guided group mortality was lower, as 46 patients died (26.5%) versus 57 (33.3%) in the clinically-guided group, but this was not statistically significant (p = 0.206).

Conclusions

Serial NT-proBNP measurement and targeting to an individual NT-proBNP value did result in advanced detection of HF-related events and importantly influenced HF-therapy, but failed to provide significant clinical improvement in terms of mortality and morbidity.

### Improved pharmacological therapy of chronic heart failure in primary care: a randomized study of NT-proBNP guided management of heart failure – SIGNAL-HF (Swedish intervention study – guidelines and NT-proBNP anaLysis in heart failure) [^5deeff81]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2010). Low credibility.

Aims

Treatment of chronic heart failure (CHF) guided by natriuretic peptides has been studied in clinical trials with conflicting results. The aim of this study was to investigate if N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP)-guided therapy in symptomatic heart failure patients in primary care would improve clinical outcomes over and above treatment according to guidelines.

Methods and Results

SIGNAL-HF was a 9 month, randomized, single-blind, parallel group study in patients with CHF in NYHA class II-IV, ejection fraction (EF) < 50% and elevated NT-proBNP levels (males > 800, females > 1000 ng/L). All investigators underwent a pre-study educational programme about current CHF guidelines. A control group managed by non-trained investigators was considered not possible for ethical and practical reasons. Patients were randomized to structured treatment of CHF according to guidelines with or without NT-proBNP monitoring. The choice and dose of therapy for CHF was at the investigator's discretion. The primary outcome variable was the composite endpoint of days alive, days out of hospital, and symptom score from the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire. In all, 252 patients were randomized. The allocation groups were well balanced with regards to age, NT-proBNP, and EF. Treatment doses of beta-blockers and blockers of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system were markedly increased towards target doses and to a similar degree in both groups. There were no differences between the groups concerning either the primary endpoint (P = 0.28) or its components [cardiovascular (CV) death, P = 0.93; CV hospitalization, P = 0.88; or symptom score, P = 0.28].

Conclusion

NT-proBNP-guided CHF treatment did not result in important improvements in clinical outcomes in patients with CHF in primary care above and beyond what could be achieved by education and structured CHF treatment according to guidelines.

### B-type natriuretic peptide-guided treatment for heart failure [^da133555]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Heart failure is a condition in which the heart does not pump enough blood to meet all the needs of the body. Symptoms of heart failure include breathlessness, fatigue and fluid retention. Outcomes for patients with heart failure are highly variable; however on average, these patients have a poor prognosis. Prognosis can be improved with early diagnosis and appropriate use of medical treatment, use of devices and transplantation. Patients with heart failure are high users of healthcare resources, not only due to drug and device treatments, but due to high costs of hospitalisation care. B-type natriuretic peptide levels are already used as biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis of heart failure, but could offer to clinicians a possible tool to guide drug treatment. This could optimise drug management in heart failure patients whilst allaying concerns over potential side effects due to drug intolerance.

Objectives

To assess whether treatment guided by serial BNP or NT-proBNP (collectively referred to as NP) monitoring improves outcomes compared with treatment guided by clinical assessment alone.

Search Methods

Searches were conducted up to 15 March 2016 in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in the Cochrane Library; MEDLINE (OVID), Embase (OVID), the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE) and the NHS Economic Evaluation Database in the Cochrane Library. Searches were also conducted in the Science Citation Index Expanded, the Conference Proceedings Citation Index on Web of Science (Thomson Reuters), World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry and ClinicalTrials.gov. We applied no date or language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials of NP-guided treatment of heart failure versus treatment guided by clinical assessment alone with no restriction on follow-up. Adults treated for heart failure, in both in-hospital and out-of-hospital settings, and trials reporting a clinical outcome were included.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected studies for inclusion, extracted data and evaluated risk of bias. Risk ratios (RR) were calculated for dichotomous data, and pooled mean differences (MD) (with 95% confidence intervals (CI)) were calculated for continuous data. We contacted trial authors to obtain missing data. Using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach, we assessed the quality of the evidence and GRADE profiler (GRADEPRO) was used to import data from Review Manager to create a 'Summary of findings' table.

Main Results

We included 18 randomised controlled trials with 3660 participants (range of mean age: 57 to 80 years) comparing NP-guided treatment with clinical assessment alone. The evidence for all-cause mortality using NP-guided treatment showed uncertainty (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.01; patients = 3169; studies = 15; low quality of the evidence), and for heart failure mortality (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.30; patients = 853; studies = 6; low quality of evidence). The evidence suggested heart failure admission was reduced by NP-guided treatment (38% versus 26%, RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.80; patients = 1928; studies = 10; low quality of evidence), but the evidence showed uncertainty for all-cause admission (57% versus 53%, RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.03; patients = 1142; studies = 6; low quality of evidence). Six studies reported on adverse events, however the results could not be pooled (patients = 1144; low quality of evidence). Only four studies provided cost of treatment results, three of these studies reported a lower cost for NP-guided treatment, whilst one reported a higher cost (results were not pooled; patients = 931, low quality of evidence). The evidence showed uncertainty for quality of life data (MD -0.03, 95% CI -1.18 to 1.13; patients = 1812; studies = 8; very low quality of evidence). We completed a 'Risk of bias' assessment for all studies. The impact of risk of bias from lack of blinding of outcome assessment and high attrition levels was examined by restricting analyses to only low 'Risk of bias' studies.

Authors' Conclusions

In patients with heart failure low-quality evidence showed a reduction in heart failure admission with NP-guided treatment while low-quality evidence showed uncertainty in the effect of NP-guided treatment for all-cause mortality, heart failure mortality, and all-cause admission. Uncertainty in the effect was further shown by very low-quality evidence for patient's quality of life. The evidence for adverse events and cost of treatment was low quality and we were unable to pool results.

### The role of natriuretic peptides as biomarkers for guiding the management of chronic heart failure [^56a4bc25]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2013). Low credibility.

The current standard treatment of chronic heart failure (HF) is based on clinical judgment, with the goal of achieving the maximally tolerated therapeutic program. The complexity of this approach may contribute to the well-established treatment gaps that exist in HF management; consequently, the risks for morbidity and mortality in this population remain extremely high. Alternative means are needed to improve the outcomes of patients with HF. Natriuretic peptides are biological markers for HF disease — its presence, severity, and prognosis — and show unique interactions with therapeutics known to have benefit in HF. Accordingly, interest has recently developed in "biomarker-guided" care for HF. This approach involves applying these assays to identify patients in need of therapy intensification and to provide an objective "monitor" of disease status. This review examines the biology of natriuretic peptides, discusses the rationale for their use in HF, and details the aggregate experience gained thus far in biomarker-guided care.

Journal of Cardiac Failure (2023). High credibility.

Therapeutic approach using natriuretic peptides in heart failure — It is easy to understand the logic for measurement of BNP or NT-proBNP as a support of clinical judgement, and both are unmistakably prognostic in acute and chronic heart failure; however, ambiguity and ambivalence remain regarding how to alter treatment based on abnormal concentrations. In acute heart failure, post-treatment natriuretic peptide values may inform alternative treatment strategies, but such strategies have not been validated. In chronic heart failure, lower NT-proBNP concentrations are linked to superior outcomes and reversal of cardiac remodeling, yet an algorithmic biomarker-based outpatient treatment approach remains elusive. Addition of other biomarkers such as ANP, high-sensitivity cardiac troponin, or soluble ST2 to NT-proBNP or BNP may help to better understand underlying pathophysiology and risk in chronic heart failure.

### Natriuretic peptides: role in the diagnosis and management of heart failure: a scientific statement from the heart failure association of the European Society of Cardiology, Heart Failure Society of America and Japanese heart failure society [^c4f455e0]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2023). High credibility.

Mechanistic and prognostic insights across heart failure stages — determinants of natriuretic peptide release and outcome thresholds. A common misconception is that concentrations of BNP or NT-proBNP mainly reflect congestion in all domains; during stabilized disease, the main determinant of BNP or NT-proBNP concentrations is transmural wall stress, helping explain prognostication in stage A or B HF and strong associations with cardiac remodeling in stage C HF. Among acute HF presentations, following diuretic therapy, robust NT-proBNP reduction is strongly linked to subsequent favorable courses, whereas in stage C HFrEF without exaggerated congestion, early decrease in NT-proBNP to < 1000 pg/mL following adjustment by guideline-directed medical therapy was linked to a 74% reduction in subsequent cardiovascular death/HF hospitalization and greater improvement in LVEF by 1 year with larger NT-proBNP reductions.

### Rationale and design of PRIMA II: a multicenter, randomized clinical trial to study the impact of in-hospital guidance for acute decompensated heart failure treatment by a predefined NT-PRoBNP target on the reduction of readmIssion and mortality rAtes [^6bb7f6a8]. American Heart Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Hospital admissions for acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) are frequent and are accompanied by high percentages of mortality and readmissions. Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and the inactive N-terminal fragment of its precursor proBNP (NT-proBNP) are currently the best predictors of prognosis in heart failure (HF) patients. In the setting of chronic HF, studies that performed guidance of therapy by NT-proBNP have had only limited success. For patients with ADHF, retrospective studies have shown that a reduction in NT-proBNP of ≤ 30% during admission is a significant predictor of HF readmissions and mortality. These data suggest a role for NT-proBNP guidance in the setting of ADHF admissions.

Study Design

The PRIMA II is an investigator-initiated, multicenter, randomized, controlled, prospective 2-arm trial that investigates the impact of inhospital guidance for ADHF treatment by a predefined NT-proBNP target (> 30% reduction during admission) on the reduction of readmission and mortality rates within 180 days. Consenting ADHF patients with NT-proBNP levels of > 1,700 ng/L are eligible. After achieving clinical stability, a total of 340 patients are randomized to either NT-proBNP-guided or conventional treatment (1:1). The primary end point is dual, that is, a composite of all-cause mortality and readmission for HF in 180 days and the number of days alive out of hospital in 180 days. Secondary end points are readmissions and/or mortality in 180 days, cost effectiveness of hospitalization days in 180 days, readmissions and mortality in 90 days, and quality of life.

Conclusion

The PRIMA II trial aims at providing scientific evidence for the use of NT-proBNP-guided therapy compared with conventional treatment in patients admitted for ADHF.

Journal of Cardiac Failure (2023). Medium credibility.

Natriuretic peptides, brain (B-type) natriuretic peptide (BNP) and N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) are globally and most often used for the diagnosis of heart failure (HF). In addition, they can have an important complementary role in the risk stratification of its prognosis. Since the development of angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitors (ARNIs), the use of natriuretic peptides as therapeutic agents has grown in importance. The present document is the result of the Trilateral Cooperation Project among the Heart Failure Association of the European Society of Cardiology, the Heart Failure Society of America and the Japanese Heart Failure Society. It represents an expert consensus that aims to provide a comprehensive, up-to-date perspective on natriuretic peptides in the diagnosis and management of HF, with a focus on the following main issues: (1) history and basic research: discovery, production and cardiovascular protection; (2) diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers: acute HF, chronic HF, inclusion/endpoint in clinical trials, and natriuretic peptides-guided therapy; (3) therapeutic use: nesiritide (BNP), carperitide (ANP) and ARNIs; and (4) gaps in knowledge and future directions.

### Established and emerging roles of biomarkers in heart failure clinical trials [^38ebb415]. Circulation: Heart Failure (2016). Low credibility.

The role of circulating biomarkers in heart failure clinical trials has evolved in recent decades. Increasing evidence behind the use of natriuretic peptides, emergence of novel biomarkers, and increased emphasis on targeting therapies toward physiological basis of disease (so-called precision medicine) have all contributed to the continued expansion of biomarker use in heart failure clinical trials. We will explore the advantages and pitfalls encountered through the use of biomarkers in clinical trials as an inclusion criterion, toxicity marker, and end point. We will also review their role in providing insights into the mechanism of action of therapeutics and guiding therapy in the management of patients with heart failure.

### Use of amino-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide to guide outpatient therapy of patients with chronic left ventricular systolic dysfunction [^21a5aae1]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2011). Low credibility.

Objectives

The aim of this study was to evaluate whether chronic heart failure (HF) therapy guided by concentrations of amino-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) is superior to standard of care (SOC) management.

Background

It is unclear whether standard HF treatment plus a goal of reducing NT-proBNP concentrations improves outcomes compared with standard management alone.

Methods

In a prospective single-center trial, 151 subjects with HF due to left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction were randomized to receive either standard HF care plus a goal to reduce NT-proBNP concentrations ≤ 1,000 pg/ml or SOC management. The primary endpoint was total cardiovascular events between groups compared using generalized estimating equations. Secondary endpoints included effects of NT-proBNP-guided care on patient quality of life as well as cardiac structure and function, assessed with echocardiography.

Results

Through a mean follow-up period of 10 ± 3 months, a significant reduction in the primary endpoint of total cardiovascular events was seen in the NT-proBNP arm compared with SOC (58 events vs. 100 events, p = 0.009; logistic odds for events 0.44, p = 0.02); Kaplan-Meier curves demonstrated significant differences in time to first event, favoring NT-proBNP-guided care (p = 0.03). No age interaction was found, with elderly patients benefitting similarly from NT-proBNP-guided care as younger subjects. Compared with SOC, NT-proBNP-guided patients had greater improvements in quality of life, demonstrated greater relative improvements in LV ejection fraction, and had more significant improvements in both LV end-systolic and -diastolic volume indexes.

Conclusions

In patients with HF due to LV systolic dysfunction, NT-proBNP-guided therapy was superior to SOC, with reduced event rates, improved quality of life, and favorable effects on cardiac remodeling. (Use of NT-proBNP Testing to Guide Heart Failure Therapy in the Outpatient Setting; NCT00351390).

### Which heart failure patients profit from natriuretic peptide guided therapy? A meta-analysis from individual patient data of randomized trials [^fb36e46f]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2015). Low credibility.

Aims

Previous analyses suggest that heart failure (HF) therapy guided by (N-terminal pro-)brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) might be dependent on left ventricular ejection fraction, age and co-morbidities, but the reasons remain unclear.

Methods and Results

To determine interactions between (NT-pro)BNP-guided therapy and HF with reduced [ejection fraction (EF) ≤ 45%; HF with reduced EF (HFrEF), n = 1731] vs. preserved EF [EF > 45%; HF with preserved EF (HFpEF), n = 301] and co-morbidities (hypertension, renal failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, cerebrovascular insult, peripheral vascular disease) on outcome, individual patient data (n = 2137) from eight NT-proBNP guidance trials were analysed using Cox-regression with multiplicative interaction terms. Endpoints were mortality and admission because of HF. Whereas in HFrEF patients (NT-pro)BNP-guided compared with symptom-guided therapy resulted in lower mortality [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.78, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.62–0.97, P = 0.03] and fewer HF admissions (HR = 0.80, 95% CI 0.67–0.97, P = 0.02), no such effect was seen in HFpEF (mortality: HR = 1.22, 95% CI 0.76–1.96, P = 0.41; HF admissions HR = 1.01, 95% CI 0.67–1.53, P = 0.97; interactions P < 0.02). Age (74 ± 11 years) interacted with treatment strategy allocation independently of EF regarding mortality (P = 0.02), but not HF admission (P = 0.54). The interaction of age and mortality was explained by the interaction of treatment strategy allocation with co-morbidities. In HFpEF, renal failure provided strongest interaction (P < 0.01; increased risk of (NT-pro)BNP-guided therapy if renal failure present), whereas in HFrEF patients, the presence of at least two of the following co-morbidities provided strongest interaction (P < 0.01; (NT-pro)BNP-guided therapy beneficial only if none or one of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, cardiovascular insult, or peripheral vascular disease present). (NT-pro)BNP-guided therapy was harmful in HFpEF patients without hypertension (P = 0.02).

Conclusion

The benefits of therapy guided by (NT-pro)BNP were present in HFrEF only. Co-morbidities seem to influence the response to (NT-pro)BNP-guided therapy and may explain the lower efficacy of this approach in elderly patients.

### N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide-guided treatment for chronic heart failure: results from the BATTLESCARRED (NT-proBNP-assisted treatment to lessen serial cardiac readmissions and death) trial [^b3cbecba]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2009). Low credibility.

Objectives

The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP)-guided therapy with those of intensive clinical management and with usual care (UC) on clinical outcomes in chronic symptomatic heart failure.

Background

Initial trial results suggest titration of therapy guided by serial plasma B-type natriuretic peptide levels improves outcomes in patients with chronic heart failure, but the concept has not received widespread acceptance. Accordingly, we conducted a longer-term study comparing the effects of NT-proBNP-guided therapy with those of intensive clinical management and with UC of patients with heart failure.

Methods

Three hundred sixty-four patients admitted to a single hospital with heart failure were randomly allocated 1:1:1 (stratified by age) to therapy guided by NT-proBNP levels or by intensive clinical management, or according to UC. Treatment strategies were applied for 2 years with follow-up to 3 years.

Results

One-year mortality was less in both the hormone- (9.1%) and clinically-guided (9.1%) groups compared with UC (18.9%; p = 0.03). Three-year mortality was selectively reduced in patients ≤ 75 years of age receiving hormone-guided treatment (15.5%) compared with their peers receiving either clinically managed treatment (30.9%; p = 0.048) or UC (31.3%; p = 0.021).

Conclusions

Intensive management of chronic heart failure improves 1-year mortality compared with UC. Compared with clinically guided treatment and UC, hormone-guided treatment selectively improves longer-term mortality in patients ≤ 75 years of age.

### Essential components in natriuretic peptide-guided management of heart failure: an intervention synthesis [^111d6c00]. Open Heart (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and the biologically inactive N-terminal fragment (NT-proBNP) are cardiac hormones collectively known as natriuretic peptides (NPs) that are synthesised and secreted in the ventricular myocardium. Serum concentrations are related to left ventricular filling pressures, and can be useful to discriminate between heart failure (HF) and other causes of breathlessness. Concentrations are higher in untreated or decompensated HF and fall after treatment. Therefore, NPs are a useful marker of cardiac function and treatment response.

Monitoring NP concentrations may guide decisions about when to alter the dose of medication, but evidence on the benefit of guiding therapy using plasma concentrations of NP has been conflicting. The most recent systematic review of 18 randomised controlled trials of NP-guided treatment of HF reported no evidence on reduction in all-cause mortality nor HF mortality, but did find evidence that NP-guided treatment reduced the number of hospital admissions. As with many systematic reviews, these studies implemented closely related but not identical versions of NP-guided treatment. Therefore, it is not clear which version should be implemented in clinical practice, where in the patient pathway the test should be conducted or which features of the intervention are critical for effectiveness. Current methods to guide the transition from research evidence to clinical practice are poorly developed, and clinical guidance is often not covered in the systematic review literature. One methodological approach to overcome the challenges of moving from evidence to practice is to use an intervention synthesis as described by Glasziou et al. This consists of three broad approaches: (1) choosing a single trial based on criteria such as feasibility, cost and effectiveness; (2) common components hybrid which extracts and recombines components based on frequency and importance; and (3) model-guided synthesis, an approach which models the mechanisms of action to assess the importance of the intervention components. The single trial-based choice and common components hybrid method is viable for a wide range of systematic reviews, whereas the model-guided synthesis is probably only possible for large systematic reviews.

The aim of this study was to determine the effective intervention components which were associated with a reduction in hospitalisations for patients with HF. This could enable policy makers and practitioners to determine specific recommendations for monitoring HF.

### Natriuretic peptides: role in the diagnosis and management of heart failure: a scientific statement from the heart failure association of the European Society of Cardiology, Heart Failure Society of America and Japanese heart failure society [^91d9bae2]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2023). High credibility.

Natriuretic peptides in heart failure — brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), N-terminal prohormone of BNP (NT-proBNP), and midregional proatrial natriuretic peptide (MR-proANP) — are useful to establish the presence and severity of heart failure and can support diagnosis as a cause of symptoms in ambulatory and emergency department settings; high levels of BNP and NT-proBNP are associated with a greater risk for adverse short- and long-term outcomes including all-cause and cardiovascular death, and predischarge BNP and NT-proBNP levels are strong predictors of the risk of death or hospital readmission for heart failure, but the efficacy for treatment guidance using serial BNP or NT-proBNP measurements remains unestablished; BNP and NT-proBNP have similarities diagnostically and either can be used, yet BNP, but not NT-proBNP, is a substrate for neprilysin, so an angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI) can increase BNP levels but not NT-proBNP levels; natriuretic peptide measurements are also useful in patients at risk of heart failure, although standardized screening remains challenging due to heterogeneous risk factors, and use of natriuretic peptides is recommended in clinical guidelines of heart failure.

### Rationale and design of the GUIDE-IT study: guiding evidence based therapy using biomarker intensified treatment in heart failure [^1ddeaac3]. JACC: Heart Failure (2014). Low credibility.

Objectives

The GUIDE-IT (Guiding Evidence Based Therapy Using Biomarker Intensified Treatment in Heart Failure) study is designed to determine the safety, efficacy, and cost-effectiveness of a strategy of adjusting therapy with the goal of achieving and maintaining a target N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) level of < 1,000 pg/ml compared with usual care in high-risk patients with systolic heart failure (HF).

Background

Elevations in natriuretic peptide (NP) levels provide key prognostic information in patients with HF. Therapies proven to improve outcomes in patients with HF are generally associated with decreasing levels of NPs, and observational data show that decreases in NP levels over time are associated with favorable outcomes. Results from smaller prospective, randomized studies of this strategy thus far have been mixed, and current guidelines do not recommend serial measurement of NP levels to guide therapy in patients with HF.

Methods

GUIDE-IT is a prospective, randomized, controlled, unblinded, multicenter clinical trial designed to randomize approximately 1,100 high-risk subjects with systolic HF (left ventricular ejection fraction ≤ 40%) to either usual care (optimized guideline-recommended therapy) or a strategy of adjusting therapy with the goal of achieving and maintaining a target NT-proBNP level of < 1,000 pg/ml. Patients in either arm of the study are followed up at regular intervals and after treatment adjustments for a minimum of 12 months. The primary endpoint of the study is time to cardiovascular death or first hospitalization for HF. Secondary endpoints include time to cardiovascular death and all-cause mortality, cumulative mortality, health-related quality of life, resource use, cost-effectiveness, and safety.

Conclusions

The GUIDE-IT study is designed to definitively assess the effects of an NP-guided strategy in high-risk patients with systolic HF on clinically relevant endpoints of mortality, hospitalization, quality of life, and medical resource use.

### Quality of life and chronic heart failure therapy guided by natriuretic peptides: results from the proBNP outpatient tailored chronic heart failure therapy (PROTECT) study [^03167a12]. American Heart Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Heart failure (HF) treatment guided by amino-terminal pro-B type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) may reduce cardiovascular event rates compared to standard-of-care (SOC) management. Comprehensive understanding regarding effect of NT-proBNP guided care on patient-reported quality of life (QOL) remains unknown.

Methods

One hundred fifty-one subjects with HF due to left ventricular systolic dysfunction were randomized to either SOC HF management or care with a goal to reduce NT-proBNP values ≤ 1000 pg/mL. Effects of HF on QOL were assessed using the Minnesota Living with HF Questionnaire (MLHFQ) quarterly, with change (Δ) in score assessed across study procedures and as a function of outcome.

Results

Overall, baseline MLHFQ score was 30. Across study visits, QOL improved in both arms, but was more improved and sustained in the NT-proBNP arm (repeated measures P = 0.01); NT-proBNP patients showing greater reduction in MLHFQ score (-10.0 vs -5.0; P = 0.05), particularly in the physical scale of the questionnaire. Baseline MLHFQ scores did not correlate with NT-proBNP; in contrast, ∆MLHFQ scores modestly correlated with ∆NT-proBNP values (ρ = .234; P = 0.006) as did relative ∆ in MLHFQ score and NT-proBNP (ρ = .253; P = 0.003). Considered in tertiles, less improvement in MLHFQ scores was associated with a higher rate of HF hospitalization, worsening HF, and cardiovascular death (P = 0.001).

Conclusions

We describe novel associations between NT-proBNP concentrations and QOL scores among patients treated with biomarker guided care. Compared to SOC HF management, NT-proBNP guided care was associated with greater and more sustained improvement in QOL (Clinical Trial Registration: www.clinicaltrials.govNCT00351390).

### Design and methods of the pro-B type natriuretic peptide outpatient tailored chronic heart failure therapy (PROTECT) study [^e3630b1d]. American Heart Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Serial measurements of N-terminal pro-B type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) provide prognostic information in patients with chronic heart failure (HF). Changes in NT-proBNP concentrations parallel prognosis; however, it remains unclear whether HF care with a goal to maximize medical therapy and also lower NT-proBNP concentrations is superior to standard HF care alone.

Aims

The aim of the study was to evaluate the hypothesis that an HF strategy guided by NT-proBNP reduces cardiovascular events compared to standard of care HF management.

Methods

In a prospective randomized single-center trial, subjects with New York Heart Association class II to IV systolic HF (left ventricular ejection fraction ≤ 40%) will be enrolled. Both groups will receive standard HF management (with a goal for minimizing HF symptoms and achieving maximal dosages of therapies with proven mortality benefit in HF), whereas one group ("NT-proBNP") will also have treatment adjustments to reduce NT-proBNP concentrations ≤ 1,000 pg/mL. The primary end point of the trial is total cardiovascular events for a 1-year period; secondary end points will include effects of NT-proBNP-guided care on cardiac structure and function, quality of life, and total costs of care.

Results

Enrollment began in 2006; of the original 300 planned, thus far, 151 subjects have been randomized. Interim analysis in November 2009 indicated significant reduction of events in the NT-proBNP arm. Full results are expected in 2010.

Conclusions

The Pro-B Type Natriuretic Peptide Outpatient Tailored Chronic Heart Failure Therapy (PROTECT) Study will test the hypothesis that therapy guided by NT-proBNP concentrations will be superior to standard of care HF management (www.clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT00351390).

Journal of Cardiac Failure (2023). High credibility.

Natriuretic peptide testing in heart failure — guideline-directed uses and evidence are as follows: 2022 AHA/ACC/HFSA states that in patients presenting with dyspnea, measurement of B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) or N-terminal prohormone of B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) is useful to support a diagnosis or exclusion of heart failure (HF) (Class I, Evidence A), in patients with chronic HF, measurements of BNP or NT-proBNP levels are recommended for risk stratification (Class I, Evidence A), and in patients hospitalized for HF, measurement of BNP or NT-proBNP levels at admission is recommended to establish prognosis (Class I, Evidence A); it also notes that in patients at risk of developing HF, BNP or NT-proBNP-based screening followed by team-based care, including a cardiovascular specialist, can be useful to prevent the development of LV dysfunction or new-onset HF (Class IIa, Evidence B-R), and in patients hospitalized for HF, a predischarge BNP or NT-proBNP level can be useful to inform the trajectory of the patient and establish a postdischarge prognosis (Class IIa, Evidence B-NR). 2021 ESC recommends that plasma concentrations of natriuretic peptides are recommended as initial diagnostic tests in patients with symptoms suggestive of HF to rule out the diagnosis, with elevated concentrations supporting a diagnosis of HF, being useful for prognostication, and potentially guiding further cardiac investigation (Class I, Evidence B). 2017 JCS/JHFS indicates use to confirm the diagnosis of HF (Class I, Evidence A), assess the severity of HF (Class I, Evidence A), assess the prognosis of HF (Class I, Evidence A), monitor the efficacy of HF treatment (Class I, Evidence B), and screen patients susceptible to HF (Class IIa, Evidence C).

### Natriuretic peptide-guided treatment for the prevention of cardiovascular events in patients without heart failure [^cee19c3a]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality globally. Early intervention for those with high cardiovascular risk is crucial in improving patient outcomes. Traditional prevention strategies for CVD have focused on conventional risk factors, such as overweight, dyslipidaemia, diabetes, and hypertension, which may reflect the potential for cardiovascular insult. Natriuretic peptides (NPs), including B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), are well-established biomarkers for the detection and diagnostic evaluation of heart failure. They are of interest for CVD prevention because they are secreted by the heart as a protective response to cardiovascular stress, strain, and damage. Therefore, measuring NP levels in patients without heart failure may be valuable for risk stratification, to identify those at highest risk of CVD who would benefit most from intensive risk reduction measures.

Objectives

To assess the effects of natriuretic peptide (NP)-guided treatment for people with cardiovascular risk factors and without heart failure.

Search Methods

Searches of the following bibliographic databases were conducted up to 9 July 2019: CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and Web of Science. Three clinical trial registries were also searched in July 2019.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials enrolling adults with one or more cardiovascular risk factors and without heart failure, which compared NP-based screening and subsequent NP-guided treatment versus standard care in all settings (i.e. community, hospital).

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened titles and abstracts and selected studies for inclusion, extracted data, and evaluated risk of bias. Risk ratios (RRs) were calculated for dichotomous data, and mean differences (MDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for continuous data. We contacted trial authors to obtain missing data and to verify crucial study characteristics. Using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach, two review authors independently assessed the quality of the evidence and GRADE profiler (GRADEPRO) was used to import data from Review Manager to create a 'Summary of findings' table.

Main Results

We included two randomised controlled trials (three reports) with 1674 participants, with mean age between 64.1 and 67.8 years. Follow-up ranged from 2 years to mean 4.3 years. For primary outcome measures, effect estimates from a single study showed uncertainty for the effect of NP-guided treatment on cardiovascular mortality in patients with cardiovascular risk factors and without heart failure (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.04 to 3.17; 1 study; 300 participants; low-quality evidence). Pooled analysis demonstrated that in comparison to standard care, NP-guided treatment probably reduces the risk of cardiovascular hospitalisation (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.68; 2 studies; 1674 participants; moderate-quality evidence). This corresponds to a risk of 163 per 1000 in the control group and 85 (95% CI 65 to 111) per 1000 in the NP-guided treatment group. When secondary outcome measures were evaluated, evidence from a pooled analysis showed uncertainty for the effect of NP-guided treatment on all-cause mortality (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.35; 2 studies; 1354 participants; low-quality evidence). Pooled analysis indicates that NP-guided treatment probably reduces the risk of all-cause hospitalisation (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.92; 2 studies; 1354 participants; moderate-quality evidence). This corresponds to a risk of 601 per 1000 in the control group and 499 (95% CI 457 to 553) per 1000 in the NP-guided treatment group. The effect estimate from a single study indicates that NP-guided treatment reduced the risk of ventricular dysfunction (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.91; 1374 participants; high-quality evidence). The risk in this study's control group was 87 per 1000, compared with 53 (95% CI 36 to 79) per 1000 with NP-guided treatment. Results from the same study show that NP-guided treatment does not affect change in NP level at the end of follow-up, relative to standard care (MD -4.06 pg/mL, 95% CI -15.07 to 6.95; 1 study; 1374 participants; moderate-quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

This review shows that NP-guided treatment is likely to reduce ventricular dysfunction and cardiovascular and all-cause hospitalisation for patients who have cardiovascular risk factors and who do not have heart failure. Effects on mortality and natriuretic peptide levels are less certain. Neither of the included studies were powered to evaluate mortality. Available evidence shows uncertainty regarding the effects of NP-guided treatment on both cardiovascular mortality and all-cause mortality; very low event numbers resulted in a high degree of imprecision in these effect estimates. Evidence also shows that NP-guided treatment may not affect NP level at the end of follow-up. As both trials included in our review were pragmatic studies, non-blinding of patients and practices may have biased results towards a finding of equivalence. Further studies with more adequately powered sample sizes and longer duration of follow-up are required to evaluate the effect of NP-guided treatment on mortality. As two trials are ongoing, one of which is a large multi-centre trial, it is hoped that future iterations of this review will benefit from larger sample sizes across a wider geographical area.

### Outpatient monitoring and treatment of chronic heart failure guided by amino-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide measurement [^c2c47649]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

Amino-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) is a strong and independent prognostic marker in patients across the spectrum of heart failure (HF) stages, including patients managed in the outpatient setting. Serial measures of NT-proBNP are more valuable than single measures for prognosis, and biologic variation of the marker should allow serial monitoring. Furthermore, given that NT-proBNP levels decrease in response to the addition of therapies with proven benefit for HF (including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, diuretics, spironolactone, exercise therapy, and biventricular pacing), it is logical to expect that targeting therapy to decrease NT-proBNP levels may facilitate more optimal use of proven HF therapies and may reduce adverse clinical outcomes. The optimal strategy for NT-proBNP monitoring with regard to frequency of testing or whether to use standard or individualized targets is still being determined. Preliminary results are promising for targeting an outpatient NT-proBNP concentration of approximately ≤ 1,000 ng/L. Current data suggest that when NT-proBNP levels are not at goal or increase from prior measurements, the risk for hazard is increased. Adjustments in treatment and serial clinical follow-up with NT-proBNP retesting should be considered at frequent intervals until biochemical stabilization or achievement of a maximally tolerated medical program.

### Natriuretic peptide-guided therapy in acute decompensated heart failure: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis [^12ae6dae]. Clinical Cardiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Most randomized controlled trials conducted to date have shown no significant differences between NP‐guided therapy and standard care in HF management. We speculate that this discrepancy could be due to several factors. First, variations in inclusion criteria, such as differences in HF severity, patient age, comorbidities, or baseline risk, may significantly influence outcomes. Additionally, the protocols for NP‐guided therapy vary widely across studies, including differences in the frequency of NP measurements, target NP levels, and subsequent therapeutic interventions. In our analysis, we compare NP‐guided care exclusively with usual care, whereas McLellan et al. in their meta‐analysis compared NP‐guided care with a combination of usual care and multidisciplinary care. This difference in selection criteria may contribute to the variations in our findings.

The standard of care for HF has improved significantly with the introduction of therapies such as sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors and angiotensin receptor‐neprilysin inhibitors, potentially reducing the incremental value of NP‐guided strategies. Additionally, the open‐label design of many trials may have led to overlap in management between NP‐guided and usual care groups, as therapeutic decisions are often influenced by multiple clinical factors beyond NP levels. This overlap may help explain the neutral findings observed in recent studies. Future trials should ensure clearer therapeutic contrasts between intervention and control groups to more accurately assess the impact of biomarker‐guided approaches.

These results should also be interpreted within the broader context of the ongoing discussion around biomarker‐ versus guideline‐directed management. As noted by Fonarow in a JAMA editorial following the GUIDE‐IT trial, NT‐proBNP‐guided therapy did not improve outcomes compared to usual care, likely due to both groups receiving similar intensities of guideline‐recommended therapy. This underscores the central importance of implementing optimal medical treatment, irrespective of biomarker levels. Nevertheless, our findings suggest that the role of NP guidance in the acute setting may still warrant further exploration, particularly when used to actively guide treatment decisions.

Journal of Cardiac Failure (2023). High credibility.

Natriuretic peptides across acute heart failure care — Natriuretic peptide (NP) levels fluctuate with left ventricular (LV) filling pressures during decompensation and improvement and exhibit intrinsic biological variability of 25–30% for NT-proBNP and 40% for BNP; in the emergency department (ED) NP use includes accuracy of diagnosis with high negative predictive value (NPV), stratification and triage, shortening decision time, and prognosis, in-hospital applications include correlation to LV filling pressure, monitoring response to intravenous (IV) therapies, assessing hemodynamic congestion, guiding discharge decisions and prognosis, and post-discharge uses include identification of residual congestion, prompting early interventions to reduce congestion, and prognosis at 1 week and 1 month; these biomarkers have the highest class of recommendation for exclusion of heart failure because of very high NPV (94%–97%), are helpful in judging whether reported worsening symptoms are related to increased left-sided cardiac filling pressures, but lack a prognostic effect in predominant right-sided HF such as severe tricuspid regurgitation.

### Natriuretic peptide-guided therapy in acute decompensated heart failure: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis [^b4e5bdbe]. Clinical Cardiology (2025). Medium credibility.

4 Discussion

We conducted a systematic review and meta‐analysis of 9 RCTs involving 3992 patients with decompensated HF, comparing NP‐guided therapy with standard care. Our main findings indicate no statistically significant differences between the NP‐guided therapy group and the usual care group in terms of all‐cause mortality, CV death, HF‐related death, composite outcomes, adverse effects, or quality of life.

NPs play a critical role in the diagnosis and prognosis of HF. These biomarkers are powerful predictors of mortality and HF‐related hospitalizations, regardless of ejection fraction or the underlying cause of HF. Despite their strong prognostic value, there is limited evidence and ongoing debate regarding the routine use of serial BNP and NT‐proBNP measurements to guide acute HF therapy versus standard care.

In the early 2000s, Troughton and colleagues provided the first evidence that NP‐guided therapy could improve outcomes in HF patients compared to standard clinically guided therapy. Since then, numerous studies have produced conflicting results. McLellan and colleagues conducted a meta‐analysis with 4063 patients with HF, summarizing the available evidence and concluding in favor of NP‐guided therapy over standard care. However, our updated systematic review and meta‐analysis, including the STRONG‐HF trial, suggests no significant advantage of NP‐guided therapy. The variability in HF populations across studies, characterized by different NYHA stages and both preserved and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction, likely contributes to these discrepancies and impacts the generalizability of the findings. HF admissions and all‐cause mortality are primary outcomes that we aimed to improve with GDMT. However, our pooled analysis revealed no significant difference compared to usual care.

### Long-term results of intensified, N-terminal-pro-B-type natriuretic peptide-guided versus symptom-guided treatment in elderly patients with heart failure: five-year follow-up from TIME-CHF [^09b63e13]. Circulation: Heart Failure (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Therapy guided by N-terminal-pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels may improve outcomes in patients with chronic heart failure (HF), especially in younger patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction. It remains unclear whether treatment effects persist after discontinuation of the NT-proBNP-guided treatment strategy.

Methods and Results

Trial of Intensified versus standard Medical therapy in Elderly patients with Congestive Heart Failure randomized 499 patients with HF aged ≥ 60 years with left ventricular ejection fraction ≤ 45% to intensified, NT-proBNP-guided versus standard, symptom-guided therapy into prespecified age groups (60–74 and ≥ 75 years) during 18 months. A total of 329 patients (92%) alive at 18 months agreed to long-term follow-up. HF medication was intensified to a larger extent in the NT-proBNP-guided group. During long-term, NT-proBNP-guided therapy did not improve hospital-free (primary end point: hazard ratio, 0.87; 95% confidence interval, 0.71–1.06; P = 0.16) or overall survival (hazard ratio, 0.85; 95% confidence interval, 0.64–1.13; P = 0.25) but did improve HF hospitalization-free survival (hazard ratio, 0.70; 95% confidence interval, 0.55–0.90; P = 0.005). Patients aged 60 to 74 years had benefit from NT-proBNP-guided therapy on the primary end point and HF hospitalization-free survival, whereas patients aged ≥ 75 years did not (P < 0.10 for interaction). In landmark analysis, there was no regression to the mean after cessation of the NT-proBNP-guided strategy. More intensified HF medication at month 12 was associated with better long-term HF hospitalization-free and overall survival.

Conclusions

Intensified, NT-proBNP-guided therapy did not improve the primary end point compared with symptom-guided therapy but did improve HF hospitalization-free survival. Within the subgroup of patients aged 60 to 74 years, it improved clinical outcome including the primary end point. These effects did not disappear after cessation of the NT-proBNP-guided strategy on the long-term. This is possibly attributable to a more intensified HF medical therapy in the NT-proBNP-guided group.

### Natriuretic peptide-guided therapy in acute decompensated heart failure: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis [^3c619bd5]. Clinical Cardiology (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Heart failure (HF) is a complex syndrome with high mortality and hospitalization rates. The management of HF is generally based on signs and symptoms (conventional or usual care), but medication adjustments can also be guided by biomarkers, specifically natriuretic peptides (NPs) — a strategy known as "NP‐guided therapy".

NPs, such as B‐type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and N‐terminal pro‐BNP (NT‐proBNP), are invaluable for diagnosing and prognosticating HF. They are potent predictors of mortality and HF hospitalization, irrespective of ejection fraction and HF etiology. BNP is an active neurohormone that counteracts the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system and sympathetic nervous system overactivity in HF, while NT‐proBNP is an inactive prohormone released from cardiomyocytes under wall stress.

However, despite the strong prognostic value of NPs, there is insufficient evidence and a lack of consensus on the routine use of serial BNP and NT‐proBNP measurements for guiding HF therapy or optimizing guideline‐directed medical therapy (GDMT) in chronic HF. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and meta‐analyses have produced conflicting results regarding the direct benefits of NP‐guided HF treatment on mortality and hospitalization rates. Acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) is a high‐risk condition requiring prompt treatment. Due to rapid volume changes and elevated event rates, NP‐guided strategies may be especially useful in this setting. Considering this controversy, we performed an updated meta‐analysis of RCTs evaluating the NP‐guided therapy compared to usual care in patients with ADHF.

### Biomarker-guided therapy in chronic heart failure: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^bcc11b82]. American Heart Journal (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Measurement of circulating natriuretic peptides has been shown to play an important role in diagnosis and prognosis in patients with chronic heart failure. Whether serial natriuretic peptide measurements to aid in the titration of therapy can improve heart failure outcomes remains uncertain. We performed a quantitative meta-analysis of available randomized controlled trials to determine whether titration of therapy based on natriuretic peptide measurements improves mortality in chronic heart failure.

Methods

We identified potentially relevant studies through a search of MEDLINE (1996–2009), ISI Web of Knowledge (1996–2009), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (1996–2009), clinicaltrials.gov, proceedings of major US and European cardiology meetings (2000–2009), and bibliographic review of secondary sources. Search terms were "biomarker", "natriuretic peptide", "B-type natriuretic peptide", "N-terminal B-type natriuretic peptide", and "heart failure". Studies were included if they were prospective, randomized controlled trials of patients with chronic heart failure, they randomized patients to a strategy of titrating medical therapy based on the level of a circulating biomarker compared to a parallel control group, and they reported all-cause mortality.

Results

Six studies randomizing 1627 patients met criteria for inclusion. Pooled analysis showed a significant mortality advantage for biomarker-guided therapy (hazard ratio was 0.69, 95% CI 0.55–0.86) compared to control. There was no quantitative evidence of heterogeneity between studies (P = 0.42).

Conclusions

Titration of therapy incorporating serial BNP or N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide levels is associated with a significant reduction in all-cause mortality compared to usual care in patients with chronic heart failure.

Journal of Cardiac Failure (2023). High credibility.

Natriuretic peptide testing for suspected acute heart failure — diagnostic thresholds and interpretation include the following: In suspected acute heart failure, a BNP cut-off concentration of 100 pg/mL provides an excellent negative predictive value to exclude acute heart failure, whereas higher values (> 400 pg/mL) deliver excellent positive predictive value. For NT-proBNP, age-dependent rule-in cut-offs are preferred (450/900/1800 pg/mL), and independent of age an NT-proBNP concentration < 300 pg/mL provides a very high negative predictive value for heart failure. When using rule-in thresholds, identification of any potential relevant confounder should be required, and patients with levels in the gray zone need extra physician attention and ancillary testing, such as chest x-ray and echocardiography. A change of 25%–30% or more from presentation usually indicates a change in clinical status, and individualized interpretation of biomarker levels, particularly in special populations and in the setting of comorbidities, is recommended.

Journal of Cardiac Failure (2023). High credibility.

Natriuretic peptides in heart failure trials — across contemporary studies, natriuretic peptide inclusion and response metrics inform risk, efficacy, and eligibility, with PARAGON-HF showing that patients in the highest quartile of NT-proBNP had nearly a 3-fold increase in adverse events, and authors indicating these biomarkers should be embedded in future trials. Specifically, patients in PARAGON-HF "had nearly a 3-fold increase in the rate of total HF hospitalizations and cardiovascular deaths", inclusion criteria "can reduce heterogeneity and regional variation", and therapy-driven decreases have "been an important measure of efficacy in many HF trials, especially in proof-of-concept phase 2 trials as surrogate endpoints", although changes "were modestly correlated with decreased HF hospitalization rates" and "did not correlate with effects on cardiovascular or all-cause mortality". Baseline levels can reveal subgroups with variable treatment and safety effects, and in GALACTIC-HF "omecamtiv mecarbil provided greater clinical benefit in patients with increasing natriuretic peptides and had no differential effect on safety". Based on this utility, "the authors suggested that natriuretic peptides be a standard component of future HF trial-eligibility criteria".

### N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide-guided therapy in chronic heart failure reduces repeated hospitalizations-results from TIME-CHF [^8a36f583]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Although heart failure (HF) patients are known to experience repeated hospitalizations, most studies evaluated only time to first event. N-Terminal B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP)-guided therapy has not convincingly been shown to improve HF-specific outcomes, and effects on recurrent all-cause hospitalization are uncertain. Therefore, we investigated the effect of NT-proBNP-guided therapy on recurrent events in HF with the use of a time-between-events approach in a hypothesis-generating analysis.

Methods and Results

The Trial of Intensified Versus Standard Medical Therapy in Elderly Patients With Congestive Heart Failure (TIME-CHF) randomized 499 HF patients, aged ≥ 60 years, left ventricular ejection fraction ≤ 45%, New York Heart Association functional class ≥ I, I to NT-proBNP-guided versus symptom-guided therapy for 18 months, with further follow-up for 5.5 years. The effect of NT-proBNP-guided therapy on recurrent HF-related and all-cause hospitalizations and/or all-cause death was explored. One hundred four patients (49 NT-proBNP-guided, 55 symptom-guided) experienced 1 and 275 patients (133 NT-proBNP-guided, 142 symptom-guided) experienced ≥ 2 all-cause hospitalization events. Regarding HF hospitalization, 132 patients (57 NT-proBNP-guided, 75 symptom-guided) experienced 1 and 122 patients (57 NT-proBNP-guided, 65 symptom-guided) experienced ≥ 2 events. NT-proBNP-guided therapy was significant in preventing 2nd all-cause hospitalizations (hazard ratio [HR] 0.83; P = 0.01), in contrast to nonsignificant results in preventing 1st all-cause hospitalization events (HR 0.91; P = 0.35). This was not the case regarding HF hospitalization events (HR 0.85 [P = 0.14] vs HR 0.73 [P = 0.01]) The beneficial effect of NT-proBNP-guided therapy was seen only in patients aged < 75 years, and not in those aged ≥ 75 years (interaction terms with P = 0.01 and P = 0.03 for all-cause hospitalization and HF hospitalization events, respectively).

Conclusion

NT-proBNP-guided therapy reduces the risk of recurrent events in patients < 75 years of age. This included all-cause hospitalization by mainly reducing later events, adding knowledge to the neutral effect on this end point when shown using time-to-first-event analysis only.

3 Results

3.1 Study Selection and Baseline Characteristics

The study selection is demonstrated in Figure 1. The initial search identified 761 studies (PubMed [n = 228], Embase [n = 438], and Cochrane [n = 95]). After title and abstract screening and removal of duplicates, 15 studies remained to be fully reviewed according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Of these, 9 RCTs were included, comprising 3992 patients, of whom 2007 (50.29%) were treated according to NT‐proBNP guided. According to the eligibility criteria, six studies were excluded: one due to addressing a different research question, four due to overlapping populations, and one for not reporting the outcomes of interest. A full description of the eligibility criteria per study can be found in Table S1. The included subjects had a mean age of 68.79 years and were mostly male (62.8%). The follow‐up ranged between 4 and 24 months, with a median of 12 months. Study characteristics are in Table 1 and Table S2. Additionally, each study's composite outcome definition and target BNP for optimization criteria for the NP‐guided group can be found in Tables S3 and S4, respectively.

Angiotensin receptor–neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI) therapy — BNP and NT-proBNP dynamics in heart failure show consistent NT-proBNP reductions with variable BNP responses. Plasma NT-proBNP levels were reduced by approximately 30% from baseline after treatment with ARNIs in randomized trials, while in PROVE-HF there was no significant change in BNP despite a 30%–34% decrease in NT-proBNP; in PARADIGM-HF, plasma BNP levels were slightly increased with ARNIs versus enalapril. BNP remained correlated with NT-proBNP, NT-proBNP seemed to be a better marker of treatment response, and atrial natriuretic peptide increased after ARNI administration.

Natriuretic peptides in HFrEF — BNP and NT-proBNP are the most studied biomarkers in heart failure and inform diagnosis and prognostication, with higher concentrations in ambulatory HFrEF indicating high risk, particularly when rising. Current clinical practice guidelines give a Class 1 recommendation to measure BNP or NT-proBNP to support diagnosis, assess disease severity, or establish prognosis. Trends in concentrations inform prognosis, congestion severity, and the trajectory of left ventricular remodeling and track with health status; thus, measuring BNP or NT-proBNP at each clinical evaluation may inform clinical decisions, with more frequent measurement appropriate during rapid medication titration or when symptoms are unstable.

Background

The GUIDE-IT (GUIDing Evidence Based Therapy Using Biomarker Intensified Treatment in Heart Failure) trial prospectively compared the efficacy of an N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP)-guided heart failure treatment strategy (target NT-proBNP level < 1,000 pg/ml) with optimal medical therapy alone in high-risk patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction. When the study was stopped for futility, 894 patients had been enrolled.

The purpose of this study was to assess treatment-related quality-of-life (QOL) and economic outcomes in the GUIDE-IT trial.

Methods

The authors prospectively collected a battery of QOL instruments at baseline and 3, 6, 12, and 24 months post-randomization (collection rates 90% to 99% of those eligible). The principal pre-specified QOL measures were the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) Overall Summary Score and the Duke Activity Status Index (DASI). Cost data were collected for 735 (97%) U.S.

Results

Baseline variables were well balanced in the 446 patients randomized to the NT-proBNP-guided therapy and 448 to usual care. Both the KCCQ and the DASI improved over the first 6 months, but no evidence was found for a strategy-related difference (mean difference [biomarker-guided - usual care] at 24 months of follow-up 2.0 for DASI [95% confidence interval (CI): -1.3 to 5.3] and 1.1 for KCCQ [95% CI: -3.7 to 5.9]). Total winsorized costs averaged $5,919 higher in the biomarker-guided strategy (95% CI: -$1,795, +$13,602) over 15-month median follow-up.

Conclusions

A strategy of NT-proBNP-guided HF therapy had higher total costs and was not more effective than usual care in improving QOL outcomes in patients with heart failure and a reduced ejection fraction. (Guiding Evidence Based Therapy Using Biomarker Intensified Treatment [GUIDE-IT]; NCT01685840).

### NT-proBNP goal achievement is Associated with significant reverse Remodeling and improved clinical outcomes in HFrEF [^5f0efef0]. JACC: Heart Failure (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

This study aims to assess the association between biomarker-guided therapy and left ventricular (LV) remodeling.

Background

In patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), it is unclear if lowering natriuretic peptides reflects structural and functional changes in the heart. This study aims to assess the association between biomarker-guided therapy and left ventricular (LV) remodeling.

Methods

The GUIDE-IT (Guiding Evidence Based Therapy Using Biomarker Intensified Treatment in Heart Failure) Echo Substudy was a multicenter study that randomized 268 patients with HFrEF (EF ≤ 40%) to either pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP)-guided treatment or usual care. Echocardiograms were performed at baseline and 12 months in 124 patients. Remodeling indices and clinical outcomes were compared between treatment arms and by achievement of the NT-proBNP goal of < 1,000 pg/ml at 12 months.

Results

At 12 months, the changes in EF and LV volumes were similar between the biomarker-guided and usual care arms with no difference in clinical outcomes; however, lowering NT-proBNP to < 1,000 pg/ml, regardless of treatment strategy, was associated with a significantly greater increase in EF compared with those not reaching goal (9.9 ± 8.8% vs. 2.9 ± 7.9%; p < 0.001) and lower LV volumes. The extent of reverse remodeling correlated with the change in NT-proBNP: a decrease of 1,000 pg/ml was associated with an increase in EF of 6.7% and a reduction in systolic and diastolic volumes of 17.3 ml/m² and 15.7 ml/m², respectively. Adverse events were significantly lower among patients achieving the NT-proBNP goal (p < 0.001).

Conclusions

Among patients with HFrEF, lowering NT-proBNP to < 1,000 pg/ml by 12 months was associated with significant reverse remodeling and improved outcomes. A greater reduction in NT-proBNP was associated with more extensive reverse remodeling. (Guiding Evidence Based Therapy Using Biomarker Intensified Treatment [GUIDE-IT]; NCT01685840).

Journal of Cardiac Failure (2023). High credibility.

ARNI-treated heart failure — prognostic value of NT-proBNP encompasses cardiac remodeling correlations and outcomes. In PROVE-HF, changes in plasma NT-proBNP were significantly correlated with changes in LV and left atrial volumes, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and parameters of diastolic function; both baseline and postrandomization NT-proBNP values, as well as changes from baseline to 1 month after randomization, had a continuous and highly significant relationship with the incidence of the primary outcome of cardiovascular death or heart failure hospitalizations in PARADIGM-HF and PARAGON-HF. Multiple study investigators have confirmed the high prognostic value of plasma natriuretic peptide levels in patients with heart failure treated with ARNIs, and plasma NT-proBNP levels are accurate markers of ARNIs' effects.

### Effect of B-type natriuretic peptide-guided treatment of chronic heart failure on total mortality and hospitalization: an individual patient meta-analysis [^1e714521]. European Heart Journal (2014). Low credibility.

The most obvious explanation for the superior mortality outcome with NP-guided therapy is that selected individual patients, based on plasma BNP/NT-proBNP levels, received appropriately higher doses of the ACEi and ARB groups of drugs. Although changes across the studies in doses of the other three groups of drugs (BB, MRA and loop diuretics) did not differ overall between the two treatment groups, it is conceivable that alterations in doses of these agents either upward or downward in individuals within the NP-guided group, as dictated by BNP/NT-proBNP levels, were more 'appropriate' than in clinically guided patients and thereby contributed to the superior mortality outcome.

Beyond considerations of total mortality, our meta-analysis showed that NP-guided treatment reduced substantially the readmission rate for heart failure and for cardiovascular disease. With regard heart failure, this observation has major financial implications since hospitalizations dominate the cost of managing this increasingly common disorder. In the USA, for example, hospitalizations account for the majority of the US$39 billion spent annually on heart failure care. Accordingly, widespread implementation of NP-guided therapy has the potential to reduce considerably the costs of heart failure care — as indeed was reported by Laramee et al.from studies utilizing serial measurements of natriuretic peptide levels by a specialist — except in patients aged > 75 years. An added impetus to the implementation of NP-guided pharmacotherapy in the USA is likely given that hospitals with high risk-standardized readmission rates will be subjected to a Medicare reimbursement penalty as of 2013.

### Natriuretic peptide-guided treatment for heart failure: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1f93ebbe]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Background

GUIDE-IT, the largest trial to date, published in August 2017, evaluating the effectiveness of natriuretic peptide (NP)-guided treatment of heart failure (HF), was stopped early for futility on a composite outcome. However, the reported effect sizes on individual outcomes of all-cause mortality and HF admissions are potentially clinically relevant.

Objective

This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to combine all available trial level evidence to determine if NP-guided treatment of HF reduces all-cause mortality and HF admissions in patients with HF.

Study Selection

Eight databases, no language restrictions, up to November 2017 were searched for all randomised controlled trials comparing NP-guided treatment versus clinical assessment alone in adult patients with HF. No language restrictions were applied. Publications were independently double screened and extracted. Fixed-effect meta-analyses were conducted.

Findings

89 papers were included, reporting 19 trials (4554 participants), average ages 62–80 years. Pooled risk ratio estimates for all-cause mortality (16 trials, 4063 participants) were 0.87, 95% CI 0.77 to 0.99 and 0.80, 95%CI 0.72 to 0.89 for HF admissions (11 trials, 2822 participants). Sensitivity analyses, restricted to low risk of bias, produced similar estimates, but were no longer statistically significant.

Conclusions

Considering all the evidence to date, the pooled effects suggest that NP-guided treatment is beneficial in reducing HF admissions and all-cause mortality. However, there is still insufficient high-quality evidence to make definitive recommendations on the use of NP-guided treatment in clinical practice.

### Obesity and serial NT-proBNP levels in guided medical therapy for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction: insights from the GUIDE-IT trial [^39f49376]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Obesity is a growing epidemic in the United States and a major risk factor for the development of heart failure (HF). 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 However, once HF develops, overweight and obese patients have paradoxically been reported to have a better prognosis compared with those who are normal or underweight. 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 Natriuretic peptides (NPs) (specifically, B‐type NP and NT‐proBNP [N‐terminal pro‐B‐type NP]) are the gold standard biomarkers for HF risk stratification, diagnosis, and prognostication. They are also unexpectedly lower in obese individuals. 7, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23

Despite having lower NP levels than nonobese patients, prior data indicate that NT‐proBNP levels may retain diagnostic and prognostic significance among obese patients presenting with acute dyspnea or advanced HF. 7, 19, 20, 21, 24, 25 The results from the multicenter, randomized GUIDE‐IT (Guiding Evidence‐Based Therapy Using Biomarker‐Intensified Treatment in HF) trial, evaluating the role of NT‐proBNP levels to guide HF management, were neutral. 26 Secondary analyses from the GUIDE‐IT trial and prior studies indicate that those who achieved the NT‐proBNP levels of ≤ 1000 pg/mL had a lower risk of adverse cardiovascular events. 17, 27, 28, 29, 30 However, the prognostic implications of having on‐treatment NT‐proBNP ≤ 1000 pg/mL in obese patients with HF receiving biomarker‐guided HF therapy are not known. Moreover, the implications of obesity, a known NP deficient state, in the setting of a guided HF trial, are not known.

We hypothesize that obese patients with HF have a greater risk of adverse cardiovascular events than nonobese patients, which is predicted by NT‐proBNP levels and improves with the attainment of NT‐proBNP levels of ≤ 1000 pg/mL. We examined the participants of the GUIDE‐IT trial to characterize HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) in obese patients by evaluating the prognostic implications of body mass index (BMI), baseline NT‐proBNP, and having NT‐proBNP levels of ≤ 1000 pg/mL in obese patients with HF receiving biomarker‐guided HF therapy. We also analyzed the optimization of guideline‐directed medical therapy (GDMT) during the study period, stratified by obesity status.

### Natriuretic peptide-guided treatment for heart failure: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^994cb617]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Natriuretic peptides (NP) are released by the myocardium in response to pressure or fluid overload and are raised in patients with heart failure (HF). NP testing is currently used in diagnosis, but its role in guiding HF treatment remains controversial. In August 2017, the long-awaited GUIDE-IT study was published by Felker and colleagues. It is the largest study of NP monitoring to date, recruiting 894 of the planned 1100 participants, and was stopped early due to futility. Lack of efficacy for the biomarker-guided treatment group compared with usual care was based on the primary end point, a composite outcome of HF admission and cardiovascular mortality. The conclusion that NP-guided treatment is not more effective than usual care has been rapidly disseminated with the paper viewed over 12 000 times in the first 4 months following publication and 22 000 to date. While the authors did not comment on the implications for practice, the emerging consensus favours an interpretation that 'any plausible effects of an intervention are unlikely to be worthwhile'. In response to the publication of the GUIDE-IT study, Bajaj et al published a research letter with a meta-analysis reporting all-cause mortality as significantly lower in the NP-guided group. This rapid analysis only collated evidence from six studies, obtained from one database for a single outcome. Although there tends to be good consistency between the single largest study and pooled estimates from a full systematic review, it is good practice to frame the newest evidence in context of the previous information. This helps validate new findings and if done by updating a previous meta-analysis, will allow for higher precision of the estimates, reduced variability and increased generalisability.

### B-type natriuretic peptide-guided heart failure therapy: a meta-analysis… [^aaa2244d]. JAMA Network (2010). Excellent credibility.

Pro-BNP is split by a protease enzyme into BNP and N-terminal pro-BNP. Compared with BNP, NT-pro-BNP is a longer peptide sequence than BNP and has a longer half-life. 6 Both BNP and NT-pro-BNP plasma concentration have been shown to be useful in the diagnosis of acute decompensated HF. 7 In addition, these peptides can be used as prognostic indicators in prediction of mortality and clinical outcome in patients with chronic HF. Specifically, lower plasma BNP levels are predictive of a reduced likelihood of future major cardiovascular events. 8, 9. As a result of treatment using BNP-guided modification, it was shown that there is an increase in prescribing of these HF medications compared with clinically guided treatment.

Specifically, the percentage of patients achieving their target dose of ACE inhibitors and β-blockers in the BNP-guided group were increased to approximately 2-fold higher than those in the control group. We identified 3 ongoing trials of BNP-guided therapy: the NorthStar study, 41 the PROTECT trial, 42 and the EXIMPROVE CHF trial. 43 The NorthStar study41 is a clinical RCT conducted in Denmark and involving 720 patients with follow-up for 30 months, in which there were 3 arms: treatment in general practice, a standard follow-up program in an HF clinic, and follow-up with plasma NT-pro-BNP levels monitored in an HF clinic. The PROTECT trial42 is an RCT in Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, that includes 300 patients with follow-up for 1 year. There are 2 arms: standard of care and NT-pro-BNP–guided groups.

The EXIMPROVE CHF study43 is an RCT in St Michael's Hospital, Toronto, Ontario, Canada, using NT-pro-BNP–guided care, with follow-up for 2 years. In summary, the present study demonstrates that BNP-guided therapy can significantly lower all-cause mortality rate in patients with chronic HF compared with those receiving usual clinical care, particularly in patients younger than 75 years but not in those of advanced age. However, this approach does not seem to either reduce all-cause hospitalization or increase survival free of hospitalization.

### Natriuretic peptide-guided therapy in acute decompensated heart failure: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis [^295997be]. Clinical Cardiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Natriuretic peptides (NP) are widely used to diagnose heart failure (HF), but their role in guiding treatment remains uncertain. We performed a randomized trial meta-analysis comparing NP-guided therapy to usual care in acute decompensated HF.

Methods

We searched PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane for RCTs comparing NP-guided therapy to usual care in acute decompensated HF. Outcomes included all-cause mortality, cardiovascular death, and a composite of mortality and HF hospitalizations (reported as RR and 95% CI). Heterogeneity was assessed using I², and a random-effects model was applied when appropriate. Analyses were performed in R Studio 4.3.2.

Results

We included 9 RCTs with 3992 patients, of whom 2007 (50.3%) underwent NP-guided treatment. The median follow-up was 12 months. All-cause mortality (RR: 0.84; 95% CI: 0.69–1.01; p = 0.069; I² = 41%), cardiovascular death (RR: 0.91; 95% CI: 0.78–1.08; p = 0.287; I² = 0%), and the composite outcome of HF hospitalization or cardiovascular death (RR: 0.91; 95% CI: 0.77–1.09; p = 0.308; I² = 56%) were not significantly different between groups. The time to event analysis of all-cause mortality had a slightly significant advantage in favor of NP-guided therapy (HR: 0.81; 95% CI: 0.69–0.95; p = 0.01; I² = 0%).

Conclusion

Although NP-guided therapy showed a statistically significant benefit in time to all-cause mortality, this was not consistently reflected across other endpoints, and its overall clinical impact remains uncertain.

Chronic heart failure — prognostic use and diagnostic rule-out cutoffs indicate that natriuretic peptides are recommended for use in establishing prognosis in chronic HF by major society guidelines with the highest level of evidence, and 2021 ESC Guidelines proposed that BNP < 35 pg/mL, NT-proBNP < 125 pg/mL, or MR-proANP < 40 pmol/L make a diagnosis of HF unlikely; BNP and NT-proBNP generally provide similar information but may diverge after initiating sacubitril/valsartan while both provide prognostic value during longitudinal treatment.

### Effect of B-type natriuretic peptide-guided treatment of chronic heart failure on total mortality and hospitalization: an individual patient meta-analysis [^98c02ac3]. European Heart Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Methods

Search strategy and selection criteria

We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE for studies published between 1 January 2000 and 29 February 2012. The search query included keywords and corresponding MeSH terms for natriuretic peptide, brain natriuretic peptide, B-type natriuretic peptide, N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide, heart failure, treatment, and therapy. Similar searches were made of the Cochrane Controlled Clinical Trials Register database and of the clinicaltrials.gov website. Only randomized controlled clinical trials reporting all-cause mortality and comparing B-type natriuretic peptide-guided treatment of heart failure with clinically guided treatment were included. The exception was one study which, while not providing all-cause mortality data, was randomized and provided robust secondary endpoint results. The search strategy was similar to that described in publications reporting meta-analyses based on aggregate data. –

Data extraction

Individual patient data from eligible studies were entered into the meta-analysis database and included patient age, gender, baseline BNP or NT-proBNP level (pg/mL), baseline creatinine (µmol/L), baseline LVEF (%), treatment assignment (NP-guided or clinically guided), and randomization date. Outcome data included all-cause mortality and date of all-cause death or last follow-up. First hospitalization for any cause, for heart failure or for any cardiovascular disease, along with the date of hospitalization was also included. Only events occurring during application of the treatment strategy were included in the analysis.

### Natriuretic peptide-guided therapy in acute decompensated heart failure: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis [^f9537ef9]. Clinical Cardiology (2025). Medium credibility.

6 Conclusion

In this meta‐analysis of 9 RCTs including 3992 patients with decompensated HF, NP‐guided therapy showed no consistent benefit over usual care in reducing mortality, hospitalizations, or improving quality of life. A significant advantage was observed only in time to all‐cause mortality, suggesting time‐dependent analysis may offer additional insight into long‐term outcomes. However, this was not mirrored in other endpoints, and the overall benefit remains uncertain. Further well‐designed trials using standardized protocols and time‐to‐event analyses are needed to clarify the role of NP‐guided therapy in the era of modern HF treatment.

### Effect of B-type natriuretic peptide-guided treatment of chronic heart failure on total mortality and hospitalization: an individual patient meta-analysis [^ed21ab83]. European Heart Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Since any therapeutic plan has the potential to unexpectedly induce or exacerbate concomitant disorders, it is noteworthy that there was no increase in overall hospitalizations and no deterioration in renal function as gauged by serum creatinine levels, with NP-guided treatment. It seems unlikely, therefore, that unexpected harm results from the implementation of NP-guided treatment.

Some limitations in our study should be noted. There were differences in study design particularly regarding BNP/NT-proBNP targets, although these did not produce heterogeneity in key results as tested in this meta-analysis. With respect to application of the NP-guided strategy, use of a single, low target level of BNP or NT-proBNP may provide more opportunities to up-titrate therapy. Our meta-analysis, however, cannot provide firm advice on this matter. Individual patient data were not available from two published studies;, however, it is unlikely that inclusion of individual data from these or other unpublished studies would have altered the overall findings of this meta-analysis. Individual data for adverse events were not available for analysis from any of the studies. However, published original reports of each individual study did not identify any significant difference in adverse events between study groups. In a subset of the current study cohort, as reported above, changes in renal function, as measured by plasma creatinine levels, did not differ between the two study groups.

To date, only NP-guided therapy has been widely tested in randomized controlled studies. However, a wide range of biomarkers reflecting different aspects of heart failure pathophysiology — including markers of renal dysfunction, fibrosis, myocardial necrosis, and inflammation — provide risk stratification that is incremental to NPs and could potentially play a role in guiding treatment. – Further study is certainly needed to evaluate multi-marker strategies to guide HF therapy.

In summary, this robust individual patient meta-analysis indicates that for patients aged < 75 years with chronic heart failure most of whom had impaired left ventricular systolic function, NP-guided treatment reduced all-cause mortality compared with clinically guided therapy. This strategy also reduces hospitalizations for heart failure and cardiovascular disorders, irrespective of age. Therefore, we propose that NP-guided treatment should be considered in such patients, although a well-powered, large scale, randomized, and blinded study which includes adequate numbers of heart failure patients with both reduced and preserved EF would provide reassurance in this regard.

### Obesity and serial NT-proBNP levels in guided medical therapy for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction: insights from the GUIDE-IT trial [^8bbab5c4]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

NT‐proBNP concentration is a strong prognostic marker in HFrEF, irrespective of obesity status. On‐treatment NT‐proBNP level ≤ 1000 pg/mL, achieved through adequate GDMT, is associated with a more favorable prognosis in HFrEF, irrespective of obesity status.

### Assessment of limitations to optimization of guideline-directed medical therapy in heart failure from the GUIDE-IT trial: a secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^6076c257]. JAMA Cardiology (2020). High credibility.

Importance

Despite evidence that guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) improves outcomes in patients with heart failure (HF) and reduced ejection fraction, many patients are undertreated. The Guiding Evidence-Based Therapy Using Biomarker Intensified Treatment (GUIDE-IT) trial tested whether a strategy of using target concentrations of N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) to guide optimization of GDMT could improve outcomes.

Objective

To examine medical therapy for HF in GUIDE-IT and potential reasons why the intervention did not produce improvements in medical therapy.

Design, Setting, and Participants

GUIDE-IT, a randomized clinical trial performed at 45 sites in the United States and Canada, was conducted from January 16, 2013, to September 20, 2016. A total of 894 patients with HF and reduced ejection fraction (≤ 40%) were randomized to NT-proBNP-guided treatment with a goal to suppress NT-proBNP concentrations to less than 1000 pg/mL vs usual care. This secondary analysis examined the medical therapy titration and reasons why the intervention did not produce improvements in care and outcomes. Data were analyzed March 27 to June 28, 2019.

Main Outcomes and Measures

For each encounter, medication titrations were captured. A reason was requested if a modification was not made. A Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to assess the independent association of drug class with outcomes.

Results

Among the 838 patients available for analysis (566 men [67.5%]; median age, 62.0 years), 6223 visits occurred during 24 months. Adjustments of HF medication were made during 2847 of 5218 qualified visits (54.6%) (all usual care visits and all guided care visits with NT-proBNP level ≥ 1000 pg/mL) in 862 patients (96.4%). Most adjustments occurred within the first 6 months, primarily within the first 6 weeks. The most common reasons for not adjusting were "clinically stable" and "already at maximally tolerated therapy". Only 130 patients (15.5%) achieved optimal GDMT (≥ 50% of the target dose of β-blockers or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers or any dose of mineralocorticoid antagonists) at 6 months, an increase from the baseline (79 of 891 [8.9%]) but not different by treatment arm. Higher doses of β-blockers were associated with reduced risk of the composite outcome of HF hospitalization and cardiovascular death (hazard ratio [HR], 0.98; 95% CI, 0.97–1.00; P = 0.008) and of all-cause death (HR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.95–0.99; P = 0.01). Higher doses of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (HR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.75–0.93; P < .001) and angiotensin receptor blockers (HR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.71–0.99; P = 0.04) were associated with reduced risk of all-cause death. Increasing doses of mineralocorticoid antagonists did not appear to be associated with improved outcomes.

Conclusions and Relevance

Despite a protocol-driven approach, many patients in GUIDE-IT did not receive medication adjustments and did not achieve optimal GDMT, including those with known elevated NT-proBNP concentrations. These results suggest that opportunities exist to titrate medications for maximal benefit in HF. GUIDE-IT may have failed to achieve treatment benefit because of therapeutic inertia in clinical practice, or current GDMT goals may be unrealistic.

### Essential components in natriuretic peptide-guided management of heart failure: an intervention synthesis [^f646b9eb]. Open Heart (2018). Low credibility.

Current guidelines from the European Society of Cardiology (ESC)highlight the residual uncertainty about the value of NP-guided therapy and make no specific recommendations for monitoring. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence suggests considering specialist monitoring of patients in whom uptitration is problematic or who have been admitted to the hospital. A recent individual patient data meta-analysis reported that the benefit of NP-guided therapy is confined to patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), and although comorbidities were associated with mortality outcomes this was not the case for HF-related hospitalisations. Similarly, a meta-regression found limited evidence of effect modification around therapy types, NYHA class, and having hypertension or diabetes, but length of follow-up and age were associated with HF-related hospitalisations.

Cocco et al also did examine why only some of the many NP-guided trials demonstrated encouraging trends. They concluded that the different approaches used in the studies with particular respect to patient selection (acute vs chronic forms of HF) and the choice of NP target were important. Some of the studies examined, set targets that were too high to reduce cardiac events, which is consistent with our finding that stringency of target may be associated with reducing hospitalisation. Finally, they observed that target NP values were chosen empirically, as opposed to being evidence-based, and these levels varied significantly. As per the ESC position they also concluded that NP-guided therapy usually led to intensification of therapy, and this could potentially explain reductions in HF-related hospitalisations. We could not rule this out with the data available to us.

### Safety and tolerability of intensified, N-terminal pro brain natriuretic peptide-guided compared with standard medical therapy in elderly patients with congestive heart failure: results from TIME-CHF [^a3a9f2e5]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2013). Low credibility.

Aims

NT-proBNP-guided therapy results in intensification of medical heart failure (HF) therapy and is suggested to improve outcome. However, it is feared that an intensified, NT-proBNP-guided therapy carries a risk of adverse effects. Therefore, the safety and tolerability of NT-proBNP-guided therapy in the Trial of Intensified vs standard Medical therapy in Elderly patients with Congestive Heart Failure (TIME-CHF) was assessed.

Methods and Results

A total of 495 chronic HF patients, aged ≥ 60, with an LVEF ≤ 45%, NYHA class ≥ II, randomized to NT-proBNP-guided or symptom-guided therapy and ≥ 1 month follow-up were included in the present safety analysis. All adverse events (AEs) were recorded during the 18-month trial period. A total of 5212 AEs were noted, 433 of them serious. NT-proBNP-guided therapy led to a higher up-titration of HF medication and was well tolerated, with a dropout rate (12% vs. 11%, P = 1.0) and AE profile [number of AEs/patient-year 4.7 (2.8–9.4) vs. 5.4 (2.7–11.4), P = 0.69; number of severe AEs/patient-year 0.7 (0–2.7) vs. 1.3 (0–3.9), P = 0.21] similar to that of symptom-guided therapy, although most subjects in both treatment groups (96% vs. 95%, P = 0.55) experienced at least one AE. Age and number of co-morbidities were associated with AEs and interacted with the safety profile of NT-proBNP-guided therapy: positive effects were more frequent in younger and less co-morbid patients whereas potential negative effects-although small and related to non-severe AEs only-were only seen in the older and more co-morbid patients.

Conclusions

NT-proBNP-guided therapy is safe in elderly and highly co-morbid HF patients. Trial registration ISRCTN43596477.

2.2 Search Strategy and Data Extraction

We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from inception to May 2024 with the following search terms: "natriuretic peptide‐guided treatment", "biomarker‐guided therapy", "usual care", "symptom‐guided treatment", "acutely decompensated HF", and "hospital setting". The complete search strategy is available in Methods S3. The study selection process included reviewing titles and abstracts initially, followed by a thorough examination of the full texts of potentially suitable studies. The references from all included studies, previous systematic reviews, and meta‐analyses were also searched manually for any additional studies.

We collected baseline characteristics for: (1) study name and year; (2) follow‐up time; (3) age; (4) female population; (5) baseline NT‐proBNP levels; (6) mean left ventricular ejection fraction at baseline; (7) number of patients in NYHA I, II, III, and IV; (8) creatinine levels at baseline; (9) country; (10) drug used in the usual care; (11) HF type; and (12) type of blinding.

C.K.F. and W.F.) independently and following a double‐blinded model, extracted selected studies, reviewed the main reports and supporting materials, and extracted the relevant information from the included trials. Any discrepancies were resolved through consensus among the authors or addressed through deliberation with other review team members (L.G.P. and E.S.K.).

2.3 Endpoints and Subgroup Analysis

The primary endpoint was all‐cause mortality. Secondary outcomes included (2) composite outcomes; (3) cardiovascular (CV) death; (4) HF hospitalizations; (5) quality of life; and (6) adverse events, specifically (i) hypotension and (ii) renal impairment. We performed a subgroup analysis for time to composite outcome according to age groups under and over 75 years old. Detailed definitions of each endpoint are provided in Methods S4.

### Natriuretic peptides: role in the diagnosis and management of heart failure: a scientific statement from the heart failure association of the European Society of Cardiology, Heart Failure Society of America and Japanese heart failure society [^5d81c5d7]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2023). High credibility.

Acute heart failure — testing recommendation and clinical utility: In acute HF care settings, natriuretic peptide testing has the potential to augment physicians' decision making across the spectrum of care, and natriuretic peptides have the advantages of objectivity, reproducibility, and widespread availability with evidence they define risk better than clinician judgment alone; importantly, natriuretic peptides should be measured in all patients presenting with symptoms suggestive of new-onset or worsening HF.

### Amino-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide testing for inpatient monitoring and treatment guidance of acute destabilized heart failure [^b0713e6e]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

Although typically elevated at presentation in the context of destabilized heart failure (HF), amino-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) values typically decrease rapidly among patients who have a favorable response to therapy. Given this, it is natural to examine the relation between NT-proBNP and therapeutic interventions for acute HF. Both presentation and posttreatment NT-proBNP concentrations have some value for prognostication of recurrent HF hospitalization or death. However, the percent change in NT-proBNP after treatment for acute HF may be a more powerful method for risk stratification. Although prospective studies on the effect of NT-proBNP measurement in guiding therapy in acute destabilized HF are lacking, observational data suggest that a 30% decrease in NT-proBNP values during hospitalization is a reasonable goal. If a baseline measure of NT-proBNP is not available, an NT-proBNP level < 4,000 ng/L after acute treatment is an alternative goal. Because the criteria for determining restabilization from destabilized HF prominently include clinical and routine laboratory testing rather than NP measures, the frequency of NT-proBNP measurement should not be excessive in patients with acute HF, with measures at baseline/presentation and after perceived recompensation to evaluate for the desired decrease in NT-proBNP concentrations. A remeasurement of NT-proBNP may also be useful for evaluation of new or worsened symptoms. In those patients without a decrease in NT-proBNP despite perceived recompensation from HF, a review of adequacy of treatment, goals of therapy, and consideration of prognosis is recommended.

### Differences in NT-proBNP response and prognosis in men and women with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction [^5abff93e]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Background NT-proBNP (N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide) is a prognostic biomarker in heart failure (HF) with reduced ejection fraction. However, it is unclear whether there is a sex difference in NT-proBNP response and whether the therapeutic goal of NT-proBNP ≤ 1000 pg/mL has equivalent prognostic value in men and women with HF with reduced ejection fraction. Methods and Results In a secondary analysis of the GUIDE-IT (Guiding Evidence Based Therapy Using Biomarker Intensified Treatment) trial we analyzed trends in NT-proBNP and goal attainment by sex. Differences in clinical characteristics, HF treatment, and time to all-cause death or HF hospitalization were compared. Landmark analysis at 3 months determined the prognostic value of early NT-proBNP goal achievement in men and women. Of the 286 (32%) women and 608 (68%) men in the GUIDE-IT trial, women were more likely to have a nonischemic cause and shorter duration of HF. Guideline-directed medical therapy was less intense over time in women. The absolute NT-proBNP values were consistently lower in women; however, the change in NT-proBNP and clinical outcomes were similar. After adjustment, women achieving the NT-proBNP goal had an 82% reduction in death or HF hospitalization compared with a 59% reduction in men. Conclusions Men and women with HF with reduced ejection fraction had a similar NT-proBNP response despite less intensive HF treatment among women. However, compared with men, the early NT-proBNP goal of ≤ 1000 pg/mL had greater prognostic value in women. Future efforts should be aimed at intensifying guideline-directed medical therapy in women, which may result in greater NT-proBNP reductions and improved outcomes in women with HF with reduced ejection fraction.

Journal of Cardiac Failure (2023). High credibility.

Clinical trials in heart failure — natriuretic peptide incorporation has increased, serving at least 4 roles in eligibility strategies and being used as objective components of contemporary universal definitions of HF and in guidelines; in COMMANDER-HF, a midtrial addition of a natriuretic peptide–based inclusion criterion to prior HF hospitalization criteria enrolled patients with substantially greater event rates, including a 30% increase in the composite of hospitalization for HF and cardiovascular death, and there was also a 70% increase in the much lower baseline rate of noncardiovascular death.

Journal of Cardiac Failure (2023). High credibility.

Natriuretic peptide–guided discharge assessment and follow-up in acute heart failure — Natriuretic peptides at discharge reflect a more stable hemodynamic state and discharge values compared with admission are more appropriately related to both HF rehospitalization and mortality; measuring NP before discharge sets a baseline for continued longitudinal monitoring and allows individualized decisions on timing, frequency, and intensity of follow-up, with lower discharge values and greater relative reduction associated with substantially better prognoses, whereas higher or nondecreasing concentrations may merit close follow-up including home monitoring; evaluating relative modifications based on each patient's stable (dry) levels may be more informative than a single measurement, and a practical approach is to consider changes > 30% as clinically relevant.

### Natriuretic peptide-based screening and heart failure… [^e7d1ff16]. JAMA Network (2013). Excellent credibility.

Intervention Patients were randomly assigned to receive usual primary care or screening with BNP testing. Intervention-group participants with BNP levels of 50 pg/mL or higher underwent echocardiography and collaborative care between their primary care physician and specialist cardiovascular service. Main Outcomes and Measures. Conclusion and Relevance Among patients at risk of heart failure, BNP-based screening and collaborative care reduced the combined rates of LV systolic dysfunction, diastolic dysfunction, and heart failure. Trial Registration clinicaltrials. gov Identifier: NCT00921960. New data suggest that more targeted surveillance using a combination of risk factors and BNP may improve identification of those at greatest risk of newly diagnosed HF.

10 Therefore, we hypothesized that BNP-based screening and intervention would target management to those at highest risk of HF and asymptomatic ventricular dysfunction, providing an approach to prevention of HF and cardiovascular disease that would be superior to standard care. The St Vincent's Screening to Prevent Heart Failure study was designed as a pragmatic, prospective randomized trial in a broad community population characterized by collaborative care intervention between cardiovascular specialists and primary care physicians. STOP–HF is the first prospective, randomized study, to our knowledge, to demonstrate a reduction in newly diagnosed HF, asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction, and emergency cardiovascular hospitalizations using BNP-guided collaborative care in a broad community cohort. It confirms BNP as a risk identifier for HF and cardiovascular events and provides unique data on the potential benefit of using levels of this peptide as a guide for care.

The positive clinical effect of this intervention was associated with improved risk factor control, increased use of agents that modulate the RAAS targeted at those with elevated BNP levels, and increased use of some cardiovascular diagnostics. These data suggest that a targeted strategy for HF prevention using BNP and collaborative care in a community population may be effective and that benefits extend beyond prevention of HF to an overall reduction in emergency cardiovascular admissions. In the setting of improved risk stratification and collaborative care as a result of rapid, near-patient BNP testing, the mechanisms explaining the benefits observed in the intervention group are likely multifactorial. They include facilitating targeted therapy changes, in particular increased used of angiotensin receptor blockers and increased use of diagnostic tests.

Although blood pressure reduction in both groups was similar, the targeted use of RAAS-modifying therapy may have contributed to the reduction in end points through mechanisms other than blood pressure reduction. 25 Patient adherence to therapy and lifestyle advice may have been encouraged by communicating risk status to patients.

### 2024 ACC expert consensus decision pathway for treatment of heart Failure with reduced ejection Fraction: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^5d3b1b47]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

ACC HFrEF decision pathway — natriuretic peptide monitoring and interpretation — states that in the setting of worsening symptoms, reassessment of BNP or NT-proBNP may be informative and measuring BNP or NT-proBNP is useful to monitor risk, guide imaging for LV remodeling, and provide objective data for referral. It cautions that sacubitril/valsartan can confound BNP because neprilysin inhibition may modestly raise BNP, whereas NT-proBNP typically decreases more consistently as it is not a neprilysin substrate; thus, in the context of ARNI treatment, NT-proBNP measurement may be preferable. It also notes that severe kidney dysfunction may interfere with natriuretic peptide interpretation.

### Use of NT-proBNP for the screening, diagnosis and risk-stratification of left ventricular dysfunction [^83cfa408]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Heart failure (HF) is a major health problem, and preventing the onset of heart failure could have large cost implications for healthcare systems globally. Screening for heart failure and its precursor, left ventricular dysfunction, could allow patients to receive therapies shown to reduce the risk of incident heart failure, such as ACE inhibitors and beta blockers. Using echocardiography to screen patients is costly. Natriuretic peptides could be used to screen populations for asymptomatic left ventricular function. However, natriuretic peptide levels vary by age, sex and presence of comorbidities such as atrial fibrillation and kidney disease. Using one threshold value in a large population may impair the sensitivity and specificity of such an approach, but prior studies in community-based adults suggest that this is a feasible strategy. A higher yield strategy would be to screen high-risk patients, such as those with diabetes mellitus, and current guidelines for the management of diabetes suggest using natriuretic peptides to screen patients for unrecognised heart failure. Natriuretic peptides can also help ascertain the risk of future cardiovascular events and deaths in patients with diabetes. Natriuretic peptides have established themselves as a central part of the definition of heart failure. However, more work needs to be done to determine the optimal age, sex and body weight-based thresholds, as well as thresholds for those with comorbidities like atrial fibrillation and chronic kidney disease. These are needed to determine and optimise the sensitivity and specificity of natriuretic peptides in the diagnosis of heart failure. Clinicians should use guideline-recommended thresholds to diagnose HF with natriuretic peptides but consider factors that influence levels, such as age, kidney function, etc. It is yet unclear if natriuretic peptides can be used to guide the management of patients with heart failure.

Study Design and Population

The study design and outcomes for the GUIDE‐IT trial have been previously published. 18, 19 Briefly, between January 16, 2013, and September 20, 2016, stable patients with HFrEF (ejection fraction ≤ 40%) were enrolled and randomized to a strategy of usual care with NT‐proBNP guidance or usual clinically directed care. Patients in the biomarker‐guided arm were treated with usual care plus serial NT‐proBNP measurements with a goal to decrease NT‐proBNP concentration < 1000 pg/mL, whereas those in the usual care arm received standard clinically guided care. Patients were to be followed for a minimum of 12 months and a maximum of 24 months. The GUIDE‐IT trial was designed to include 1100 patients but was stopped by the data safety monitoring board for futility after 894 patients (81% of planned) were enrolled. 18 No difference in achieved NT‐proBNP concentrations or clinical outcomes was found between the study arms and the medical management of both study groups was comparable. The study was funded by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and approved by the institutional review board at each study site. All patients provided written informed consent to participate.

2022 AHA/ACC/HFSA heart failure guideline — use of biomarkers for prevention, initial diagnosis, and risk stratification states the following recommendations: In patients presenting with dyspnea, measurement of B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) or N-terminal prohormone of B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) is useful to support a diagnosis or exclusion of heart failure (HF) (1 A). In patients with chronic HF, measurements of BNP or NT-proBNP levels are recommended for risk stratification (1 A). In patients hospitalized for HF, measurement of BNP or NT-proBNP levels at admission is recommended to establish prognosis (1 A). In patients at risk of developing HF, BNP or NT-proBNP–based screening followed by team-based care, including a cardiovascular specialist, can be useful to prevent the development of left ventricular (LV) dysfunction or new-onset HF (2a B-R). In patients hospitalized for HF, a predischarge BNP or NT-proBNP level can be useful to inform the trajectory of the patient and establish a postdischarge prognosis (2a B-NR).

### Natriuretic peptide response and outcomes in chronic heart Failure with reduced ejection fraction [^69c59905]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The GUIDE-IT (GUIDing Evidence Based Therapy Using Biomarker Intensified Treatment in Heart Failure) trial demonstrated that a strategy to "guide" application of guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) by reducing amino-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) was not superior to GDMT alone.

Objectives

The purpose of this study was to examine the prognostic meaning of NT-proBNP changes following heart failure (HF) therapy intensification relative to the goal NT-proBNP value of 1,000 pg/ml explored in the GUIDE-IT trial.

Methods

A total of 638 study participants were included who were alive and had available NT-proBNP results 90 days after randomization. Rates of subsequent cardiovascular (CV) death/HF hospitalization or all-cause mortality during follow-up and Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) overall scores were analyzed.

Results

A total of 198 (31.0%) subjects had an NT-proBNP ≤ 1,000 pg/ml at 90 days with no difference in achievement of NT-proBNP goal between the biomarker-guided and usual care arms. NT-proBNP ≤ 1,000 pg/ml by 90 days was associated with longer freedom from CV/HF hospitalization or all-cause mortality (p < 0.001 for both) and lower adjusted hazard of subsequent HF hospitalization/CV death (hazard ratio: 0.26; 95% confidence interval: 0.15 to 0.46; p < 0.001) and all-cause mortality (hazard ratio: 0.34; 95% confidence interval: 0.15 to 0.77; p = 0.009). Regardless of elevated baseline concentration, an NT-proBNP ≤ 1,000 pg/ml at 90 days was associated with better outcomes and significantly better KCCQ overall scores (p = 0.02).

Conclusions

Patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction whose NT-proBNP levels decreased to ≤ 1,000 pg/ml during GDMT had better outcomes. These findings may help to understand the results of the GUIDE-IT trial. (Guiding Evidence Based Therapy Using Biomarker Intensified Treatment [GUIDE-IT]; NCT01685840).

### Prognostic impact of repeated NT-proBNP measurements in patients With heart Failure with reduced Ejection Fraction [^3b05784b]. JACC: Heart Failure (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Although clinical studies have demonstrated the association between a single N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) measurement and clinical outcomes in chronic heart failure, the biomarker is frequently measured serially in clinical practice.

Objectives

The aim of this study was to determine the added prognostic value of repeated NT-proBNP measurements compared with single measurements alone for chronic heart failure patients.

Methods

In the GUIDE-IT (Guiding Evidence Based Therapy Using Biomarker Intensified Treatment in Heart Failure) study, 894 study participants with chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction were enrolled at 45 outpatient sites in the United States and Canada. Repeated NT-proBNP levels were measured over a 2-year study period. Associations between repeated NT-proBNP measurements and trial endpoints were assessed using a joint longitudinal and survival model.

Results

After adjustment for baseline covariates, each doubling of the baseline NT-proBNP level was associated with a HR of 1.17 (95% CI: 1.08–1.28; P = 0.0003) for the primary trial endpoint of cardiovascular death or heart failure hospitalization. Serial measurements increased the adjusted HR for the primary trial endpoint to 1.66 (95% CI: 1.50–1.84; P < 0.0001), and a similar increased risk was observed across secondary trial endpoints. In joint modeling, an increase in NT-proBNP occurred weeks before the onset of adjudicated events.

Conclusions

Repeated NT-proBNP measurements are a strong predictor of outcomes in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction with an increase in concentration occurring well before event onset. These results may support routine NT-proBNP monitoring to assist in clinical decision making. (Guiding Evidence Based Therapy Using Biomarker Intensified Treatment in Heart Failure [GUIDE-IT]; NCT01685840).

Study Procedures

The GUIDE‐IT trial participants underwent extensive baseline testing and physical examination before simple, unrestricted randomization to respective HF management arms. Subjects were followed up at 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months, and then every 3 months for the remaining study period. Each follow‐up visit entailed the collection of blood for NT‐proBNP assessment locally (in biomarker‐guided arm only) and additional sample collection for centralized NT‐proBNP testing (in both arms) at the biomarker core laboratory in Duke Clinical Research Institute, Durham, NC. 31 The results from core laboratory assessments were not transmitted back to the investigators. The follow‐up visits also involved focused history collection, physical examination, and medication adjustment with the documentation of the rationale behind the adjustments. Although the specific medication adjustments were at the discretion of the treating physicians, prioritization of the neurohormonal antagonist titration was encouraged over diuretics in the absence of volume overload or congestion. 26, 31 The prespecified primary outcome for the GUIDE‐IT trial was the time‐to‐first HF hospitalization or cardiovascular cause of death, which was adjudicated by a blinded clinical events committee. The trial was discontinued by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute–appointed data and safety monitoring board at 81% of planned enrollment after 50% of planned primary end point events had occurred, as the study met the prespecified inefficiency criteria. 26

### Natriuretic peptide-guided therapy in acute decompensated heart failure: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis [^5606fcc5]. Clinical Cardiology (2025). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT

Background

Natriuretic peptides (NP) are widely used to diagnose heart failure (HF), but their role in guiding treatment remains uncertain. We performed a randomized trial meta‐analysis comparing NP‐guided therapy to usual care in acute decompensated HF.

Methods

We searched PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane for RCTs comparing NP‐guided therapy to usual care in acute decompensated HF. Outcomes included all‐cause mortality, cardiovascular death, and a composite of mortality and HF hospitalizations (reported as RR and 95% CI). Heterogeneity was assessed using I², and a random‐effects model was applied when appropriate. Analyses were performed in R Studio 4.3.2.

Results

We included 9 RCTs with 3992 patients, of whom 2007 (50.3%) underwent NP‐guided treatment. The median follow‐up was 12 months. All‐cause mortality (RR: 0.84; 95% CI: 0.69–1.01; p = 0.069; I² = 41%), cardiovascular death (RR: 0.91; 95% CI: 0.78–1.08; p = 0.287; I² = 0%), and the composite outcome of HF hospitalization or cardiovascular death (RR: 0.91; 95% CI: 0.77–1.09; p = 0.308; I² = 56%) were not significantly different between groups. The time to event analysis of all‐cause mortality had a slightly significant advantage in favor of NP‐guided therapy (HR: 0.81; 95% CI: 0.69–0.95; p = 0.01; I² = 0%).

Conclusion

Although NP‐guided therapy showed a statistically significant benefit in time to all‐cause mortality, this was not consistently reflected across other endpoints, and its overall clinical impact remains uncertain.

### Cost-effectiveness of N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic-guided therapy in elderly heart failure patients: results from TIME-CHF (trial of intensified versus standard medical therapy in elderly patients with congestive heart failure) [^1f5ba364]. JACC: Heart Failure (2013). Low credibility.

Objectives

This study aimed to assess cost-effectiveness of N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP)-guided versus symptom-guided therapy in heart failure (HF) patients ≥ 60 years old.

Background

Cost-effectiveness of NT-proBNP guidance in HF patients is unclear. It may create additional costs with uncertain benefits.

Methods

In the TIME-CHF (Trial of Intensified versus Standard Medical Therapy in Elderly Patients with Congestive Heart Failure), patients with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of ≤ 45% were randomized to receive intensified NT-proBNP-guided therapy or standard, symptom-guided therapy. For cost-effectiveness analysis, 467 (94%) patients (age 76 ± 7 years, 66% male) were eligible. Incremental cost-effectiveness was calculated as incremental costs per gained life-year and quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) within the 18-month trial period, as defined per protocol.

Results

NT-proBNP-guided therapy was dominant (i.e., more effective and less costly) over symptom-guided therapy, saving $2,979 USD (2.5 to 97.5% confidence interval [CI]: $8,758 to $3,265) per patient, with incremental effectiveness of +0.07 life-years and +0.05 QALYs. The probability of NT-proBNP-guided therapy being dominant was 80%, and the probability of saving 1 life-year or QALY at a cost of $50,000 was 97% and 93%, respectively. Exclusion of residence costs resulted in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $5,870 per life-year gained. Cost-effectiveness of NT-proBNP-guided therapy was most pronounced in patients < 75 years old and in those with < 2 significant comorbidities, being dominant in all sensitivity analyses. In the worst-case scenario (excluding residence costs in those with ≥ 2 comorbidities), the ICER was $11,935 per life-year gained.

Conclusions

NT-proBNP-guided therapy has a high probability of being cost effective in HF patients with reduced LVEF, particularly in patients age 60 to 75 years or with less than 2 comorbidities.

### Effect of B-type natriuretic peptide-guided treatment of chronic heart failure on total mortality and hospitalization: an individual patient meta-analysis [^e5656762]. European Heart Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Results

We identified 11 eligible studies (Figure 1, Table 1), – 8 of which provided individual patient data for all-cause mortality (n = 2000). – Based on excellent concordance between data provided for the meta-analysis and the original published reports, the quality of data was judged to be high. All studies reported endpoints on an intention-to-treat basis. For two studies, data from only two treatment groups (NP-guided and clinically guided) who received intensive clinical follow-up were considered for the analysis, whereas data from the third ('usual care') groups were not included. For two studies, complete individual patient data were not available but aggregate data on overall mortality were obtained from published reports (n = 2431 when aggregate data included). Finally, the ProBNP Outpatient Tailored Chronic Heart Failure Therapy (PROTECT) trial, while not providing overall mortality data, gave robust secondary endpoint results (n = 2151 for individual patients with data for secondary end-points).

Study characteristics

There were differences between studies regarding design relating to duration, target plasma level for the B-type natriuretic peptides, and treatment algorithm (Table 1), but all studies compared a treatment strategy guided by BNP/NT-proBNP with clinically guided treatment. The majority of studies used a single target BNP or NT-proBNP level for the NP-guided group. In two studies, age-stratified NT-proBNP targets were utilized. In one study, a target of ≥ 50% reduction in NT-proBNP was usedand in a further two studies an individualized BNP or NT-proBNP target was utilized based on levels at discharge from hospital. Treatment algorithms differed slightly between studies, but were all based upon stepwise up-titration of guideline-recommended drug therapies.

Patient characteristics

Patient characteristics for the meta-analysis cohort and for individual studies are summarized in Table 2. The average age of participants was 72 years and two-thirds were male. The majority of subjects had LV systolic dysfunction and only 10% had an LVEF > 45%.

### Direct comparison of serial B-type natriuretic peptide and NT-proBNP levels for prediction of short-and long-term outcome in acute decompensated heart failure [^3850dc71]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

Acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) is the leading cause of hospitalization in adults over 65 years. Despite medical progress, ADHF is still the most costly cardiovascular disorder in Western countries and is associated with a very poor prognosis.

Early prediction of a patient's clinical course is pivotal for selecting appropriate management strategies for patients with ADHF. However, risk stratification in these patients is still difficult. The tools used for the evaluation of disease severity and prognosis in the past have been criticized because epidemiological and clinical factors like age, New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class, or Killip class were shown to be inadequately sensitive. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) determined by echocardiography was once considered a reliable surrogate prognostic marker. Recent reports, however, have demonstrated that about 50% of patients admitted with ADHF have a preserved LVEF.

B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) are quantitative markers of cardiac wall stress. Both natriuretic peptides (NPs) have been shown to accurately mirror heart failure (HF) severity and to correlate well with NYHA classification. BNP and NT-proBNP are cleaved in equimolar amounts from proBNP; thus, NP levels correlate with each other. Despite the considerable similarities between the two NPs, their different half-lives and different modes of degradation argue for a separate analysis and make a direct comparison indispensable.

In patients with HF, serial evaluations of BNP and NT-proBNP levels may be useful for guiding therapy decisions by indicating the need for treatment intensification. It is, however, unknown whether BNP and NT-proBNP differ in their utility to risk-stratify patients with ADHF. Also, little is known regarding the earliest time point for reliable assessment of treatment efficacy and prognosis. Therefore, the objectives of this study were (a) to define BNP and NT-proBNP plasma concentration profiles from admission to discharge in order to establish the more appropriate timing for these measurements, (b) to assess the role of BNP and NT-proBNP sequential measurement as a marker of clinical improvement of patients with ADHF in response to therapy, and (c) to compare the prognostic utility of BNP and NT-proBNP in this setting.

Screening and prognostication using natriuretic peptides — STOP-HF and predischarge use show that in the STOP-HF study, participants in the intervention group with BNP levels ≥ 50 pg/mL underwent echocardiography and referral to a cardiovascular specialist and BNP-based screening reduced the composite endpoint of incident asymptomatic LV dysfunction or overt HF; additionally, predischarge BNP and NT-proBNP levels are strong predictors of the risk of death or hospital readmission for HF, and although decreases during treatment are associated with better outcomes than no change or a rise, targeting a certain threshold, value, or relative change during hospitalization has not been shown to be consistently effective in improving outcomes.

NT‐proBNP is a clear prognostic indicator in patients with HF regardless of ethnicity and HF phenotype. With abundant research supporting the exceptional predictive value of serial NT‐proBNP measurements, many clinical trials have been undertaken to assess the efficacy of NT‐proBNP–guided therapy in HF management. Although these trials bear considerable differences in enrollment criteria, patient characteristics, intervention strategy and its achievement, meta‐analyses have shown positive and beneficial effects of NT‐proBNP–guided therapy in reducing HF admissions, mortality, or both. Recent post hoc analyses of clinical trials also revealed no interactions of clinical covariates on the prognostic relevance of the change in NT‐proBNP. For example, in the Irbesartan in Patients with Heart Failure and Preserved Ejection Fraction study, the presence of AF, ischemic and hypertensive cause, or diabetes at baseline did not modify the associations of the change in NT‐proBNP with cardiovascular death or HF hospitalization. Secondary analysis of Aliskiren Trial on Acute Heart Failure Outcomes also reported no interaction by AF and diabetes in either the predictive values of NT‐proBNP at baseline, 1 month after hospitalization, or Δ (change from baseline to 1‐month postdischarge) for the composite of cardiovascular mortality or HF hospitalization. Several observational studies report consistent prognostic relevance of change in NT‐proBNP concentrations regardless of ageand prevalent obesity. In parallel with previous studies, we found a profound predictive utility of NT‐proBNP change in patients with HF, irrespective of important clinical covariates, such as HF phenotype, age, and comorbidities, including obesity, CKD, and AF. These findings substantiate the use of serial NT‐proBNP measurements for risk assessments in all patients with HF.
