## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the evaluation and management plan for a 21-year-old woman with a right thoracic 18° curve from T8 to L1 (apex T10–T11) and a left lumbar 12° curve from L1 to L4, including severity classification, progression risk, indications for surgery or bracing, role of exercises, imaging/red flags, monitoring, and triggers for escalation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and curve characterization using standard Cobb methodology. Then, I should classify the severity against guideline thresholds and verify skeletal maturity. Next, I will estimate progression risk in a skeletally mature patient. After that, I will examine indications for surgery, bracing, and exercises. I will then review red flags and imaging pathways, consider quality-of-life implications, define a monitoring plan, and finally synthesize specific recommendations and escalation triggers based on evidence and guidelines [^114PybSv] [^114csBB3] [^1116zLKX].

> Let me first confirm the fundamentals. Scoliosis is defined as a structural lateral curvature of at least 10° by Cobb method, and this patient clearly meets that threshold with two structural curves, which reads as a double-curve pattern likely representing residual adolescent idiopathic scoliosis persisting into adulthood, given the typical natural history of AIS transitioning after skeletal maturity [^114csBB3] [^1112eEH5]. Wait, let me verify measurement standards and imaging positioning because reproducibility matters for follow-up; guidelines emphasize accurate Cobb measurement on properly acquired standing radiographs with standardized technique and consistent positioning to reduce variability, which we will need for longitudinal monitoring [^114PybSv].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about severity without anchoring to guideline strata. I need to check severity categories: mild generally spans 10–20°, moderate 20–40 to 45°, and severe above 40–45° where surgical consideration enters the discussion in adolescents, so her thoracic 18° and lumbar 12° curves fit within mild severity, with the thoracic curve near the lower bound of moderate but still below it [^1116zLKX] [^1112eEH5]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially recalled a moderate band starting at 25°, but reviewing family medicine and broader AIS summaries, the common clinical thresholds for action still align around 20° for bracing in growing patients and 40–45° for surgical evaluation, so classifying both curves as mild is appropriate here [^1116zLKX] [^1112eEH5].

> I should confirm skeletal maturity and progression risk next. At age 21, she is skeletally mature, effectively Risser 5, and progression risk drops substantially after maturity; the greatest risk window is during growth, whereas in late adolescence and early adulthood most mild curves behave indolently, though long-term progression can occur and is best stratified by magnitude, curve type, and prior behavior on serial films [^114C8xtj] [^1171Amx5]. Let me reconsider expected progression rates in this magnitude range; while exact adult progression estimates vary, curves under 30° at maturity generally have low annual progression and often remain stable, which supports surveillance rather than intervention in this case barring symptoms or documented progression on serial studies [^114C8xtj] [^1171Amx5].

> Now I will examine the question of surgery. I need to ensure I am applying thresholds properly: in adolescents, surgery is typically considered beyond about 40–45° or for refractory symptoms, and in adults it is primarily symptom-driven and reserved for more severe or progressive deformities with disability or imbalance; neither applies here because both curves are far below such thresholds and no disabling symptoms have been described [^1116zLKX] [^117EgxMv] [^1138bKof]. Hold on, I should verify adult data do not suggest earlier surgical consideration at these magnitudes; indeed, adult series focus on larger, symptomatic curves, with meaningful benefit primarily in that context, which further supports a conservative approach here [^117EgxMv] [^1138bKof].

> Next, I need to think about bracing. My first instinct is to consider bracing around 20–25° if progression risk is present, but wait, let me verify the context: the SOSORT and AAFP guidance situates bracing for growing patients with curves typically above 20° and risk of progression, with brace wear continued until end of growth, not for skeletally mature adults with mild curves, so bracing is not indicated here [^111pfUi5] [^111pxiok] [^115apAMb] [^116e34qm]. I should double-check whether any exception exists for adults at 18°; I do not see supportive evidence for bracing efficacy after maturity at this magnitude, and guideline language emphasizes growth-dependent benefit, confirming that observation and exercise are more appropriate [^111pfUi5] [^115apAMb].

> Let me consider the role of physical therapy and scoliosis-specific exercises. Evidence and guidelines permit or recommend scoliosis-specific physiotherapy for mild curves to improve posture, function, and possibly attenuate progression, with moderate-quality support in adolescents and emerging data in broader populations; while adult-specific RCTs are limited, the risk is low and functional benefits are reasonable, so I would recommend an SSE program such as Schroth or SEAS tailored by a trained therapist [^1116zLKX] [^112zCasX] [^1156BkZW]. Hold on, I should verify expectations; improvements tend to be in pain, posture, and quality-of-life domains rather than large Cobb changes at these magnitudes, which aligns with goal setting for this patient [^1156BkZW] [^1116zLKX].

> Before finalizing, I will now examine differential considerations and red flags that might pivot us to advanced imaging. I need to ensure there is no suggestion of congenital anomalies, neuromuscular etiologies, early-onset disease, rapid progression, or neurologic deficits; in their absence, MRI is not routinely indicated for typical AIS patterns, especially after skeletal maturity, and radiographs remain the primary imaging modality for classification and monitoring [^115xNSDS] [^1154Mj8P] [^111mUeo6]. But wait, what if subtle atypical features are present or symptoms evolve; then selective MRI is appropriate per ACR criteria, so return precautions and low threshold for re-evaluation are important parts of the plan [^111JQU86] [^115xNSDS].

> Next, I should review imaging technique and measurement reliability for follow-up. Let me first confirm best practices: obtain standing PA full-spine radiographs with appropriate field including femoral heads, protect gonads, and add lateral views to assess sagittal balance, using standardized arm positions for lateral imaging to preserve physiologic alignment, which improves comparability over time and limits measurement error [^116nKKRm] [^112ctdM7] [^116ZrKmB]. I need to ensure we interpret small changes cautiously; differences under about 5° can reflect positioning and measurement variability, so I will define clinically significant progression as at least a 5° increase on reproducible studies with consistent positioning and technique [^112D7cZa] [^112wAzKC].

> I will now consider functional and quality-of-life implications and how to measure them. Even with mild curves, some patients report body image concerns or intermittent back pain, though impacts generally rise with curve magnitude; structured patient-reported outcomes such as the SRS-22r help track function, pain, mental health, and self-image over time and support shared decision-making in conservative care [^1112eEH5] [^113rqybf]. Hold on, I should verify the mental health signal; although many data derive from surgical cohorts, PRO frameworks consistently capture anxiety and self-image domains relevant to conservative management as well, so baseline and follow-up PROs are reasonable here [^111xkDLS] [^113rqybf].

> Now I need to set a monitoring cadence that matches the low risk profile. Let me think about balancing radiation with vigilance: for a skeletally mature adult with mild, likely stable curves, a clinical exam every 6–12 months with repeat standing PA and lateral radiographs about annually is reasonable if asymptomatic, with earlier imaging if symptoms emerge or exam suggests change, always using consistent technique and positioning to minimize variability and radiation dose [^116nKKRm] [^112wAzKC]. I should double-check thresholds for action; documenting a reproducible increase of at least 5° or new sagittal imbalance would prompt earlier reassessment of the plan [^112D7cZa] [^116ZrKmB].

> Bringing this together, my primary recommendation is conservative management centered on scoliosis-specific physical therapy, education, and watchful monitoring. Let me verify the pieces: referral to a certified scoliosis therapist for an SSE program, baseline SRS-22r to anchor PROs, posture and core training with activity encouragement, and scheduled follow-up with standardized radiography align with current guideline-consistent conservative care for mild curves in skeletally mature patients [^1116zLKX] [^112zCasX] [^113rqybf]. I need to ensure return precautions are explicit; new neurologic symptoms, escalating pain unresponsive to conservative measures, or visible progression should trigger earlier reassessment and potential imaging, including MRI if red flags arise [^115xNSDS] [^111JQU86].

> I should confirm clear thresholds for escalation. A documented increase of at least 5° on reproducible studies, sustained progression toward the mid-20s to 30s, or the development of significant symptoms would warrant re-evaluation; while bracing has limited or no established role after maturity at these magnitudes, a multidisciplinary discussion can be considered if curves approach adolescent bracing thresholds or if unique biomechanical factors are present, and surgical consultation becomes relevant only with larger, symptomatic, or imbalanced deformities approaching traditional thresholds or causing disability [^111pfUi5] [^115apAMb] [^1116zLKX] [^117EgxMv]. Wait, let me verify I am not overstating bracing for adults; guidelines frame bracing within growth, so in this 21-year-old I would not expect brace benefit, and escalation would more realistically be toward advanced conservative pain management or, if substantially progressive and symptomatic, surgical evaluation, not bracing [^111pxiok] [^111pfUi5].

> Finally, I need to ensure documentation and risk communication are thorough. I will record baseline Cobb angles with vertebral levels and apex, sagittal parameters, PROs, maturity status, and the shared decision to pursue SSE-based conservative care with defined follow-up and return precautions, emphasizing that current curve magnitudes are mild, below interventional thresholds, with a low but nonzero long-term progression risk after maturity that we will surveil together [^1116zLKX] [^113rqybf] [^114C8xtj]. Let me double-check that the plan aligns with patient goals and guideline direction; this approach is consistent with evidence-informed care for mild residual AIS in adults and maintains a safe path for early detection of any change over time [^1116zLKX] [^116nKKRm].

The patient's thoracic and lumbar curves are **mild** and **unlikely to progress** at age 21, so observation with periodic clinical and radiographic follow-up is appropriate [^114csBB3] [^1171Amx5] [^113W12V6]. Bracing is **not indicated** [^115apAMb], and surgery is **not warranted** unless the curves progress beyond 45–50° or become symptomatic [^1112eEH5]. Conservative management with scoliosis-specific exercises and core strengthening may help maintain function and reduce discomfort [^1116zLKX] [^1156BkZW]. The **prognosis is favorable**, with low risk of progression or significant functional impairment, but regular monitoring is recommended to detect any changes early [^114csBB3].

---

## Clinical significance of cobb angles

The **thoracic curve (18°)** is **mild (10–25°)** and is typically managed conservatively with observation and periodic follow-up [^1116zLKX]. The **lumbar curve (12°)** is likewise **mild** and generally managed conservatively [^114csBB3].

---

## Risk of progression

The **risk of progression** is influenced by age, skeletal maturity, curve magnitude, and curve pattern:

- **Age and skeletal maturity**: At 21 years old, the patient is likely skeletally mature, significantly reducing the risk of progression compared to adolescents [^1171Amx5].

- **Curve magnitude**: Curves less than 20° have a low risk of progression after skeletal maturity, typically less than 10% over a lifetime [^114csBB3].

- **Curve pattern**: Double curves (thoracic and lumbar) may have a slightly higher risk of progression than single curves, but the risk remains low for mild curves in skeletally mature patients [^114hqDY5].

Overall, the patient's curves are **mild** and **unlikely to progress significantly** [^114csBB3].

---

## Recommended management strategies

Given the patient's mild curves and skeletal maturity, **conservative management is appropriate**:

- **Observation**: Regular clinical and radiographic follow-up every 6–12 months to monitor for any progression or development of symptoms [^113W12V6].

- **Physical therapy**: Scoliosis-specific exercises (e.g. Schroth method) and core strengthening exercises may help maintain spinal flexibility, improve posture, and reduce discomfort [^112zCasX] [^1116zLKX].

- **Bracing**: Not indicated for curves less than 20° in skeletally mature patients [^115apAMb].

- **Surgical intervention**: Not indicated unless the curve progresses significantly (typically > 45–50°) or becomes symptomatic [^1112eEH5].

---

## Potential complications and long-term outcomes

- **Pain**: Mild curves may be associated with occasional back pain, but significant chronic pain is uncommon [^114csBB3].

- **Functional impairment**: Mild curves typically do not cause significant functional impairment or disability [^114C8xtj].

- **Cosmetic concerns**: Mild curves may cause minimal cosmetic concerns, but these are generally well tolerated [^1112eEH5].

- **Quality of life**: Most patients with mild curves maintain a good quality of life with conservative management [^1112eEH5].

---

## Prognosis

The **prognosis** for this patient is **favorable**. The curves are **mild**, with a low likelihood of significant progression or substantial functional impairment or pain. Regular monitoring and conservative management should suffice [^1171Amx5].

---

## Summary table

| **Curve** | **Magnitude** | **Clinical significance** | **Risk of progression** | **Recommended management** | **Prognosis** |
|-|-|-|-|-|-|
| Thoracic (T8-L1) | 18° | Mild | Low | - Observation <br/> - Physical therapy | Favorable |
| Lumbar (L1-L4) | 12° | Mild | Low | - Observation <br/> - Physical therapy | Favorable |

---

The patient's thoracic and lumbar curves are **mild** and **unlikely to progress** significantly [^114csBB3]. Conservative **management** with observation and physical therapy is appropriate, and the prognosis is favorable [^112zCasX].

### Prediction of future curve angle using prior radiographs in previously untreated idiopathic scoliosis: Natural history from age 6 to after the end of growth (SOSORT 2022 award winner) [^1171Amx5]. European Spine Journal (2023). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study is to inform treatment selection for idiopathic scoliosis by assessing the risk of curve progression. Previous predictive models for curve progression lacked validation, did not encompass the full growth or severity spectrum, or included patients who had already undergone treatment. The objective was to develop and validate models predicting future curve angles using clinical data collected either solely at or both at and before an initial specialist consultation in cases of idiopathic scoliosis.

Methods: This analysis covers 2317 patients with idiopathic scoliosis, aged between 6 and 25 years. Patients were previously untreated and provided at least one prior radiograph collected prospectively at the first consultation. These radiographs were re-measured, blinded to the predicted outcome, which was the maximum Cobb angle on the last radiograph while untreated. Linear mixed-effect models were employed to analyze the effect of data from the first available visit (age, sex, maximum Cobb angle, Risser stage, and curve type) and data from subsequent untreated visits (maximum Cobb angle) as well as the time from the first available radiograph to the prediction on the Cobb angle outcome. Interactions between the first available angle and time, time and sex, and time with Risser were also tested.

Results: The study included 2317 patients, with 83% being female, and a total of 3255 prior X-rays. Of these, 71% had 1 X-ray, 21.1% had 2, and 7.5% had 3 or more. The mean age of participants was 13.9 ± 2.2 years, and 81% had adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS). Curve types were distributed as follows: 50% double, 26% lumbar/thoracolumbar-lumbar, 16% thoracic, and 8% other. The Cobb angle at the first available X-ray was 20 ± 10° (range 0–80°), compared to 29 ± 13° (range 6–122°) at the outcome visit, with a separation of 28 ± 22 months.

### The experience of living with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis: A qualitative evidence synthesis using meta-ethnography [^1112eEH5]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Scoliosis is a structural spinal deformity defined by a lateral spinal curvature of 10° or more (using the Cobb method) and spinal rotation. Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS), which is diagnosed from 10 years old, is the most common type of scoliosis, and there is no known cause. AIS affects 0.5–5.2% of adolescents, predominantly females, aged 10–16 years. Clinical management in AIS varies depending on curve severity and risk factors for curve progression. Typically:

- **No treatment for mild curvature (10°-20°)**: This approach involves "watchful waiting".
- **Mild to moderate curvature**: Spinal bracing and/or physiotherapy-based exercise treatments can be prescribed.
- **Severe curvature (> 45°)**: Spinal surgery is considered.

AIS is associated with altered balance, walking, and breathing patterns, poorer cardiopulmonary function, lower physical activity, back pain, and low bone mineral density. Impacts on function and quality of life increase as curve severity increases. There is no clear relationship in the literature between AIS and overall function, but individuals with AIS have been shown to be at greater risk of experiencing poorer body image, lower self-esteem, and mental ill-health. Back pain, lower exercise capacity, and treatments such as bracing or surgery can affect quality of life. Overall, long-term health-related quality of life can be generally good for people with AIS who undergo surgery or conservative treatments, although it is often worse than those without AIS.

### Automated 3d Cobb angle measurement using U-Net in CT images of preoperative scoliosis patients [^111XhhXY]. Journal of Imaging Informatics in Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

This study demonstrated that automated 3D Cobb angle measurements from CT scans show a strong correlation with traditional 2D radiograph measurements. Despite the higher radiation exposure from CT scans, their use can be justified in certain clinical situations. CT imaging provides comprehensive 3D views of spinal deformities, particularly valuable in severe scoliosis cases. The ability to accurately assess vertebral rotations and alignments in three dimensions offers significant advantages for surgical planning and intervention. However, it is essential to balance the benefits of detailed anatomical information with the risks associated with increased radiation exposure. For routine scoliosis monitoring, traditional radiographs may suffice. In contrast, for preoperative evaluations and complex cases where detailed 3D visualization is critical, the use of CT scans can be justified. Clinicians should carefully consider the clinical context and prioritize imaging modalities based on the specific needs of each patient.

There are several limitations in this study. Firstly, the validation was performed based on limited internal samples, instead of a large-scale external dataset. The main reason is the difficulty in acquiring public data for AIS patients with both CT data and X-ray. During the data selection process, researchers also encountered inconsistencies in the field of view of CT and X-ray. For example, some X-rays covered the entire spine while the corresponding CT scans only covered a part, and in some cases, did not fully cover the scoliosis curvature.

### Three-dimensional computed tomography analysis of spinal canal length increase after surgery for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis: A multicenter study [^111isYCA]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery. American Volume (2019). Low credibility.

Posterior spinal instrumentation and correction is the standard technique for the treatment of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis. Since the introduction of Harrington instrumentation, effective procedures for surgical correction of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis have developed rapidly. These techniques have made it possible to correct all three dimensions of the scoliotic deformity. The rate of complications associated with deformity correction in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis ranges from 5% to 23%. The Scoliosis Research Society has reported that neurological defects occur after approximately 0.8% of surgical procedures for correction of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis. The most severe neurological complications are incomplete spinal cord injury and nerve root compression, traction, or other injury. A recent meta-analysis of perioperative complications revealed a frequency of neurological complications of 0.5% and a frequency of spinal cord injury of 0.14%. Signal changes demonstrated by intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring were most frequently associated with spinal traction or patient positioning. Several animal models have demonstrated that distraction of the spinal canal results in histological evidence of spinal cord damage. These findings suggest that it is important to understand the relationship between correction of scoliotic deformity and the distraction distance of the spinal canal to lessen the risk of intraoperative and postoperative neurological complications.

In this study, we used three-dimensional (3D) computed tomography (CT)-based imaging.

### Change in Cobb angle of each segment of the major curve after posterior vertebral column resection (PVCR): a preliminary discussion of correction mechanisms of PVCR [^116spq7w]. European Spine Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Posterior vertebral column resection (PVCR) is an effective technique for treating severe rigid spinal deformities, offering corrective effects unmatched by any other osteotomy. The purpose of this study was to discuss the correction mechanisms of PVCR.

- **Materials and methods**: Forty-six patients with severe rigid spinal deformities undergoing PVCR were retrospectively analyzed. According to a routine posteroanterior supine entire spine radiograph performed before and after surgery, the major curve on the coronal plane was divided into three segments factitiously: the upper segment (from the superior endplate of the upper vertebra of the major curve to the inferior endplate of the upper vertebra adjacent to the resected vertebra), the middle segment (from the inferior endplate of the upper vertebra adjacent to the resected vertebra to the superior endplate of the lower vertebra of the resected vertebra), and the lower segment (from the superior endplate of the lower vertebra of the resected vertebra to the inferior endplate of the lower end vertebra of the major curve). The Cobb method was used to measure the curvature of the major curve and each segment. We analyzed the changes in the Cobb angle in the major curve and each segment. We also analyzed the correlation between the placement of pedicle screws and deformity correction.

- **Results**: The Cobb angle of the major curve decreased from 110.1 ± 18.1° to 51.0 ± 17.3° (p < 0.05) after surgery, indicating a decrease of 59.1 ± 16.4°. The mean correction rate was 54.1 ± 12.2% (p < 0.05). The Cobb angle of the middle segment decreased significantly, showing a strong correction related to the placement of pedicle screws and surgical intervention.

### Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis: 5-year to 20-year evidence-based surgical results [^114374pt]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2010). Low credibility.

Surgical intervention for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) should be substantiated by scientific research proving its ability to alter the natural history without causing iatrogenic complications. The risks of surgery must be clearly outweighed by its long-term benefits compared to mere observation. This review conducted a systematic search of the literature to critically evaluate the scientific evidence on the long-term outcomes and complications of surgical intervention for AIS. Our search identified 39 distinct patient populations with a minimum average follow-up of 5 years. No long-term, prospective controlled studies exist to support the hypothesis that surgical intervention for AIS is superior to natural history. Although surgery reliably arrests the progression of deformity, achieves permanent correction, and improves appearance, there is no medical necessity for surgery based solely on the literature. However, the psychological impact must be considered, especially when a patient struggles to cope with the deformity.

### Three-dimensional computed tomography analysis of spinal canal length increase after surgery for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis: A multicenter study [^111xMfq2]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery. American Volume (2019). Low credibility.

A standing whole-spine radiograph, in addition to supine side-bending and traction radiographs, was acquired for all patients no more than three months before surgery. The Cobb angles of the proximal thoracic curve, main thoracic curve, and thoracolumbar/lumbar curve were measured on the standing radiograph. Additionally, the Cobb angle of the main thoracic curve was measured on the bending and traction radiographs. Further measurements included the thoracic kyphosis (T5-T12) angle, lumbar lordosis (T12-S1) angle, and thoracic apical vertebral translation. Preoperative curve flexibility was determined based on the supine side-bending and traction radiographs.

A standing whole-spine radiograph was also obtained within one month (inpatient) after surgery. These radiographs were analyzed and measured. The postoperative proximal thoracic, main thoracic, and thoracolumbar/lumbar Cobb angles; thoracic kyphosis; lumbar lordosis; and percent correction of the main thoracic curve were also assessed.

### Spinal decompensation in degenerative lumbar scoliosis [^115cAqsX]. European Spine Journal (2010). Low credibility.

One potential effect of severe degeneration is scoliosis. In a study of 88 patients with degenerative lumbar scoliosis, a significant relationship was found between curve direction and the apex of the curve. Curves with an apex above L2 were mostly convex to the right, whereas those with an apex below L2 were more frequently convex to the left. This indicates that in degenerative scoliosis, the innate curvature or rotatory pattern of the spine is an important factor in the direction of spinal decompensation. Although the normal spine does not show pre-existing rotation at the lumbar level, the asymmetry of the whole spine is presumably directive for the decompensatory changes.

The primary symptoms observed were back pain and radicular leg pain. Notably, the side of unilateral symptoms was unrelated to the curve direction. This finding supports the concept that symptoms are the result of specific degenerative changes, irrespective of the scoliotic curve direction.

Regarding non-pharmacologic interventions for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis, specifically in relation to bracing, the SOSORT 2018 guidelines recommend wearing braces until the end of vertebral bone growth. Following this, it is advised to gradually reduce the wearing time, unless otherwise decided at the discretion of a clinician specialized in the conservative treatment of spinal deformities.

### Curve type, flexibility, correction, and rotation are predictors of curve progression in patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis undergoing conservative treatment: a systematic review [^114hqDY5]. The Bone & Joint Journal (2022). Low credibility.

Accurate forecasting of curve progression in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS), using readily available radiological predictors, is challenging due to the multifactorial nature and variable progression of AIS curves. The prognostication of curve progression requires identification of threshold levels of relevant factors and corresponding effect sizes for each predictor to enable clinical risk classification. This approach allows for appropriate follow-up for patients at higher risk and provides an explanation of the likely outcome.

Under the International Society on Scoliosis Orthopaedic and Rehabilitation Treatment (SOSORT) treatment guidelines, bracing is initially advised when curves exceed 20° with a risk of progression, while patients with curves less than 15° are generally put under observation. Conservative treatment in this review, therefore, refers to bracing and observation. While bracing is known to alter the natural history of AIS, it is important that we evaluate predictors for progression separately for braced and unbraced patients.

A previous systematic review by Van den Bogaart et al. summarized evidence for predictors of curve progression in braced patients from the literature up to October 2017. The study concluded that strong evidence existed for the initial in-brace correction rate predicting brace success, while moderate evidence indicated that curve magnitude and curve type were not associated with brace outcomes. The study found inconclusive evidence for most predictors. However, this study used the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation.

### Noninvasive measurement and screening techniques for spinal deformities [^113W12V6]. Neurosurgery (2008). Low credibility.

Spinal deformities are caused by a heterogeneous collection of disease processes. The progression of the scoliotic curve can vary depending on the individual patient, as well as the curve etiology. Noninvasive measurement techniques have been developed to obtain a baseline and record curve progression.

- **Objective**: We designed our study based on a comprehensive literature review and clinical experience. A systematic review of Medline for articles related to spinal deformities (scoliosis) and screening techniques was conducted up to and including those journal articles published in March 2007.

- **Methods**: There are numerous noninvasive modalities available to assess curve progression.

- **Results**: The use of a detailed physical examination, serial examinations, and radiographic means serve well to document curve presence and monitor progression.

### Validation of adult spinal deformity surgical outcome prediction tools in adult symptomatic lumbar scoliosis [^112b9gw6]. Spine (2023). High credibility.

This study used a post hoc analysis to investigate advances in machine learning (ML) that have led to tools offering individualized outcome predictions for adult spinal deformity (ASD). The objective was to examine the properties of these ASD models in a cohort of adult symptomatic lumbar scoliosis (ASLS) patients. ML algorithms produce patient-specific probabilities of outcomes, including major complication (MC), reoperation (RO), and readmission (RA) in ASD, necessitating external validation of these models.

- **Methods**: Thirty-nine predictive factors (12 demographic, 9 radiographic, 4 health-related quality of life, 14 surgical) were retrieved and entered into web-based prediction models for MC, unplanned RO, and hospital RA. Calculated probabilities were compared with actual event rates. Discrimination and calibration were analyzed using receiver operative characteristic area under the curve (where 0.5 indicates chance and 1 indicates perfect) and calibration curves, quantified by Brier scores (where 0.25 indicates chance and 0 indicates perfect). Ninety-five percent confidence intervals are reported.

- **Results**: A total of 169 of 187 (90%) surgical patients completed a 2-year follow-up. The observed rate of MCs was 41.4%, with model predictions ranging from 13% to 68% (mean: 38.7%). RO was observed at 20.7%, with model predictions ranging from 9% to 54% (mean: 30.1%). Hospital RA was observed at 17.2%, with model predictions ranging from 13% to 50% (mean: 28.5%). Model classification for all three outcome measures was better than chance [area under the curve: MC 0.6 (0.5–0.7), RA 0.6 (0.5–0.7), RO 0.6 (0.5–0.7)]. Calibration was better.

### Is there asymmetry between the concave and convex pedicles in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis? A CT investigation [^117LykJ7]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2017). Low credibility.

Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis is a complex three-dimensional deformity of the spine characterized by deformities in the sagittal, coronal, and axial planes. Spinal fusion using pedicle screw instrumentation is a widely used method for surgical correction in severe adolescent idiopathic scoliosis curves (coronal deformity, Cobb angle > 45°). Understanding the anatomic differences in the pedicles of patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis is essential to reduce the risk of neurovascular or visceral injury through pedicle screw misplacement.

- **Questions/purposes**: To use CT scans (1) to analyze pedicle anatomy in the adolescent thoracic scoliotic spine, comparing concave and convex pedicles, and (2) to assess the intra- and interobserver reliability of these measurements to provide critical information to spine surgeons regarding size, length, and angle of projection.

- **Methods**: Between 2007 and 2009, 27 patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis underwent thoracoscopic anterior correction surgery by two experienced spinal surgeons. Preoperatively, each patient underwent a CT scan, as was their standard of care at that time. Twenty-two patients (mean age, 15.7 years; SD, 2.4 years; range, 11.6–22 years) (mean Cobb angle, 53°; SD, 5.3°; range, 42°-63°) were selected. Inclusion criteria were a clinical diagnosis of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis, female, and Lenke type 1 adolescent idiopathic scoliosis with the major curve confined to the thoracic spine. Using three-dimensional image analysis software, the pedicle width, inner cortical pedicle width, pedicle height…

### Patient-reported mental health and quality of life in pediatric adolescent idiopathic scoliosis patients [^111xkDLS]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. Global Research & Reviews (2025). Low credibility.

Surgical management is considered if the spinal curve progresses to a major Cobb angle of ≥ 45° in adolescents. Spinal fusion is the most common procedure that aims to correct spinal curvature and stop curve progression. Many patients report experiencing depression or anxiety before surgery, and these symptoms can persist after the procedure. However, it has been observed that postoperative improvements in spinal curvature often correlate with better PROs, including reduction in anxiety and depressive symptoms.

Common symptoms experienced by patients following spinal fusion surgery may include occasional back pain, limited range of motion, and activity restrictions. The effect of these symptoms on overall health remains uncertain. Several studies indicate that poorer PRO scores are often observed preoperatively, particularly in patients with more severe curvature. However, these scores generally improve following surgery. Studies consistently demonstrate that the only domain where scores remain low after surgery is in physical function, suggesting that posterior spine implants may sometimes limit mobility. Overall, although initial improvements are common, the presence of complications can negatively affect long-term recovery and quality of life.

In the long term, many patients show improvements in body image, self-esteem, and reductions in anxiety and depressive symptoms in the first year after surgery. However, follow-up assessments indicate that some HRQoL measures remain stable for about a decade post-surgery.

### Experience with an online prospective database on adolescent idiopathic scoliosis: Development and implementation [^111pzuk3]. European Spine Journal (2008). Low credibility.

Considerable variability exists in the surgical treatment and outcomes of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) due to the lack of evidence-based treatment guidelines and outcome measures. Although clinical trials have been extolled as the highest form of evidence for evaluating treatment efficacy, the disadvantages of cost, time, lack of feasibility, and ethical considerations indicate a need for a new paradigm for evidence-based research in this spinal deformity. High-quality clinical databases offer an alternative approach for evidence-based research in medicine.

We developed and established Scolisoft, an international, multidimensional, and relational database designed to be a repository of surgical cases for AIS and an active vehicle for standardized surgical information. This format permits qualitative and quantitative research and analysis. Here, we describe and discuss the utility of Scolisoft as a new paradigm for evidence-based research on AIS. Scolisoft was developed using the dot.net platform and SQL Server from Microsoft. All data is de-identified to protect patient privacy.

Scolisoft can be accessed for high-quality data collection on surgical cases of AIS, which is a priority, and processes continue to improve database quality. The database currently has 67 registered users from 21 countries. At the time of writing, Scolisoft contains 200 detailed surgical cases with pre, post, and follow-up data. Scolisoft provides a structured process and practical information for surgeons to benchmark their treatment methods against similar treatments.

### Whether orthotic management and exercise are equally effective to the patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis in mainland China? A randomized controlled trial study [^116yUiRD]. Spine (2018). High credibility.

This study was a prospective randomized controlled trial designed to investigate the effectiveness of orthotic management versus exercise on spinal curvature, body symmetry, and quality of life among patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) in mainland China.

A number of well-designed studies comparing conservative treatment of AIS have been conducted, strengthening the evidence in this field. However, information specifically on the effectiveness of orthotic management versus exercise remains limited.

- **Methods**: The study enrolled patients based on the inclusion criteria recommended by the Scoliosis Research Society (SRS) and the International Society on Scoliosis Orthopedic and Rehabilitation Treatment (SOSORT). Patients were randomly assigned to either the bracing group or the exercise group. The bracing group received a prescription for a rigid thoracolumbosacral orthosis to be worn for 23 hours a day, while the exercise group followed the Scientific Exercise Approach to Scoliosis protocol. Data on angle of trunk inclination, Cobb angle, shoulder balance, body image, and quality of life (QoL) were collected every six months.

- **Results**: The study included 24 patients in the bracing group and 29 patients in the exercise group. Intergroup comparison showed that the bracing group achieved better outcomes in terms of spinal curvature correction (Cobb angle at the first 12 months of intervention, P = 0.039). Additionally, QoL scores, particularly in function (P < 0.001), mental health (P < 0.001), and total score (P < 0.001), were significantly higher in the bracing group.

### Traction versus supine SIDE-bending radiographs in determining flexibility: What factors influence these techniques [^117LJxyT]. Spine (2007). Low credibility.

This study is a prospective clinical and radiologic study of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) patients. The objective was to evaluate the Cobb angle in the standing position, patient age, the level of the apex, and the number of involved vertebrae to determine whether traction radiographs or supine side-bending radiographs were superior in assessing flexibility.

Side-bending and traction radiographs are commonly used to evaluate curve flexibility during corrective surgery for AIS. Despite their use, notable differences in the flexibilities of identical curves require further investigation to interpret these differences correctly.

A total of 229 consecutive patients with AIS who underwent surgical treatment were evaluated. Radiographs were taken in standing, supine side-bending, and traction positions before surgery. The curves were classified into main thoracic (MT) or thoracolumbar/lumbar (TL/L) curves, and proximal thoracic (PT) curves. Key variables assessed included the Cobb angle in standing position, level of apex, number of involved vertebrae, kyphosis angle of main thoracic curve, and patient age. This evaluation aimed to determine the superior corrective ability between traction and side-bending radiographs.

In the results, 219 curves were observed within MT lesions. The traction flexibility rate (FR) was significantly higher than the side-bending FR for curves with an angle of ≥ 60 degrees (P = 0.02). This trend was also observed in patients younger than 15 years (P = 0.02), in curves with an apex located at T4-T8/T9 (P = 0.01), in cases where 6 or 7 vertebrae were involved (P = 0.02), and with a kyphosis angle between 10 degrees and higher.

### Clinical improvement through nonoperative treatment of adult spinal deformity: who is likely to benefit [^117YFQFb]. Neurosurgical Focus (2014). Low credibility.

The goal of this study was to determine the outcome and risk factors in patients with adult spinal deformity (ASD) who elected to receive nonoperative care.

- **Methods**: In this retrospective study, the authors reviewed a nonoperative branch of the International Spine Study Group database, derived from 10 sites across the US. Specific inclusion criteria included nonoperative treatment for ASD and the availability of Scoliosis Research Society (SRS)-22 scores and radiographic data at baseline (BL) and at 1-year (1Y) follow-up. Health-related quality of life measures were assessed using the SRS-22 and radiographic data. Changes in SRS-22 scores were evaluated by domain and expressed in number of minimum clinically important differences (MCIDs) gained or lost; baseline and 1-year scores were also compared with age- and sex-matched normative references.

- **Results**: One hundred eighty-nine patients (mean age 53 years, 86% female) met inclusion criteria. Pain was the domain with the largest offset for 43% of patients, followed by the appearance (23%), activity (18%), and mental (15%) domains. On average, patients improved 0.3 MCID in pain over 1 year, without changes in activity or appearance. Baseline scores significantly impacted 1-year outcomes, with up to 85% of patients in the mildest category of deformity being classified as < 1 MCID of normative reference at 1 year, versus 0% of patients with the most severe initial deformity. Baseline radiographic parameters did not correlate with outcome.

- **Conclusions**: Patients who received nonoperative care are significantly more disabled than age- and sex-matched normative references.

### Congenital scoliosis: A review and update [^111mUeo6]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2007). Low credibility.

Vertebral anomalies causing congenital scoliosis are classified on the basis of failures of formation, segmentation, or both. The natural history depends on the type and location of the anomaly. Patient evaluation focuses on the history and physical examination, followed by appropriate imaging modalities. The hallmark of surgical treatment is early intervention before the development of large curvatures. The surgical treatment of a congenital deformity mandates the use of neurological monitoring to minimize the risk of perioperative neurological deficit. Modern surgical techniques have evolved to include the routine use of spinal instrumentation. Patients with associated chest wall deformities or large compensatory curves may be candidates for vertical expansion prosthetic titanium rib placement or growing rods insertion to maximize growth.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis, and specifically in the context of diagnostic imaging, the SOSORT 2018 guidelines recommend obtaining frontal radiographic studies posteroanteriorly. These studies should utilize digital films with appropriate X-ray ratios, including visualization of the femoral heads, and ensure the protection of the gonads. The imaging should be done in any standing position without the use of support aids or the indication of correct posture, unless otherwise directed by a clinician specializing in spinal deformities.

### A century of spine surgery: What can patients expect [^1121ZJzH]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2008). Low credibility.

To evaluate the hypothesis that spinal fusion surgery is an effective method to address spinal deformity-associated clinical problems, including the magnitude of curvature (Cobb angle), pulmonary dysfunction, and pain, a systematic review was carried out. This review utilized the Science Citation Index (SCI) Expanded (1900 - present), Social Sciences Citation Index (1956 - present), Arts and Humanities Citation Index (1965 - present), Medline (1950 - present), and PubMed Central databases (1887 - present) to access information regarding the efficacy of spine surgery in preventing or improving the health and function of patients diagnosed with scoliosis in adolescence.

Since 1950, more than 12,600 articles on scoliosis have been published, with nearly 50% (5,721) focusing on the methods, rationale, outcome, and complications of surgical intervention. Among these, 82 articles have documented outcomes for groups of 10 or more patients treated for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis and followed for at least 2 years after treatment. These data provide an overview of the impact of spine surgery on scoliosis for 5,780 patients as surgical methods and approaches have evolved.

For most patients, a reduced magnitude of spinal curvature can be achieved through one or more spinal fusion surgeries. However, there is no evidence to support the premise that this result is correlated with improved pulmonary function or reduced pain.

### Operative vs nonoperative treatment for adult symptomatic lumbar scoliosis at 8-year follow-up: A nonrandomized clinical trial [^1152AJn8]. JAMA Surgery (2025). Low credibility.

Long-term follow-up studies of operative and nonoperative treatment of adult symptomatic lumbar scoliosis (ASLS) are essential to assess benefits and durability.

- **Objective**: To assess the durability of treatment outcomes for operative vs nonoperative treatment of ASLS.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: The Adult Symptomatic Lumbar Scoliosis 1 (ASLS-1) study was a multicenter, prospective study with randomized and observational cohorts designed to assess operative vs nonoperative ASLS treatment. Operative and nonoperative patients were compared using as-treated analysis of combined randomized and observational cohorts. Patients with ASLS aged 40 to 80 years were enrolled at 9 centers in North America. Data were analyzed from November 2023 to July 2024.

- **Interventions**: Operative and nonoperative treatment approaches.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Primary outcome measures were the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) and Scoliosis Research Society 22 (SRS-22) at 2-, 5-, and 8-year follow-up.

- **Results**: The 286 enrolled patients (104 in the nonoperative group: median [IQR] age, 61.9 [54.4–68.8] years; 97 female [93%]; 182 in the operative group: median [IQR] age, 60.2 [53.5–66.6] years; 161 female [88%]) had follow-up rates at 2, 5, and 8 years of 90% (256 of 286), 70% (199 of 286), and 72% (205 of 286), respectively. At 2 years, compared with those in the nonoperative group, patients in the operative group had better ODI (mean difference = -12.98; 95% CI, -16.08 to -9.88; P < .001) and SRS-22 (mean difference = 0.57; 95% CI, 0.45–0.70; P < .001) scores, with mean differences exceeding the minimum clinically important difference for both measures.

### Clinical outcomes of the traditional dual growing rod technique combined with apical pedicle screws in the treatment of early-onset scoliosis: preliminary results from a single center [^115cnyC8]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics (2023). Low credibility.

Limited control of an apical deformity is a major disadvantage in the traditional dual growing rod (TDGR) technique. Previous literature has reported the results of apical pedicle screw placement (APS) as an apical control technique in patients with early-onset scoliosis (EOS). However, the clinical outcomes, indications, and complications of the TDGR technique combined with APSs have not been well described. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the preliminary clinical outcomes of the TDGR technique combined with APSs in EOS patients.

Clinical data of 12 patients with EOS who were treated with the TDGR technique combined with APSs at the index surgery at the authors' center from January 2010 to January 2020, with a minimum 2-year follow-up, were retrospectively reviewed. Indications for the use of APSs included: 1) no vertebral segmentation failure, fused ribs, or multiple hemivertebrae at the apex; 2) at least 2 normal discs around the apex; and 3) proper development of apical pedicles on the convex side. Etiology, age at index surgery, number of lengthening procedures, follow-up duration, and complications were recorded. Radiographic measurements included Cobb angle, apical vertebral translation (AVT), apical vertebral rotation (AVR), thoracic kyphosis, lumbar lordosis, spine height, and space available for the lung (SAL).

The mean follow-up period was 4.0 ± 1.4 years, with a mean of 4.8 lengthening procedures per patient. The mean Cobb angle improved from 61.7° ± 10.4° to 19.9° ± 9.0° after the index surgery (19.6° ± 9.4° at the latest follow-up).

### Operative versus nonoperative treatment for adult symptomatic lumbar scoliosis [^117EgxMv]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery. American Volume (2019). Low credibility.

The effectiveness of operative treatment compared to nonoperative treatment for adult lumbar scoliosis at initial presentation (with no prior fusion) has not, to our knowledge, been evaluated in controlled trials. The goals of this study were to evaluate the effects of both operative and nonoperative treatments and to assess their benefits, aiding treating physicians in determining whether patients are better managed operatively or nonoperatively.

- **Methods**: Patients with adult symptomatic lumbar scoliosis (aged 40 to 80 years), with a coronal Cobb angle measurement of ≥ 30° and an Oswestry Disability Index [ODI] score of ≥ 20 or Scoliosis Research Society [SRS]-22 score of ≤ 4.0, were enrolled from 9 North American centers. They took part in randomized or observational cohorts to evaluate operative versus nonoperative treatments. The primary outcomes were differences in the mean change from baseline in the SRS-22 subscore and ODI at 2-year follow-up. For the randomized cohort, the initial sample-size calculation estimated that 41 patients per group (82 total) would provide 80% power with an alpha equal to 0.05, anticipating 10% loss to follow-up and 20% nonadherence in the nonoperative arm. However, an interim sample-size calculation estimated that 18 patients per group would be sufficient.

- **Results**: Sixty-three patients were enrolled in the randomized cohort, with 30 in the operative group and 33 in the nonoperative group. Meanwhile, 223 patients were enrolled in the observational cohort, with 112 in the operative group and 111 in the nonoperative group. The intention-to-treat…

### Screening for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis: US Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^114C8xtj]. JAMA (2018). Low credibility.

Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis, a lateral curvature of the spine of unknown cause with a Cobb angle of at least 10°, occurs in children and adolescents aged 10 to 18 years. Idiopathic scoliosis is the most common form and usually worsens during adolescence before skeletal maturity. Severe spinal curvature may be associated with adverse long-term health outcomes, such as pulmonary disorders, disability, back pain, psychological effects, cosmetic issues, and reduced quality of life. Early identification and effective treatment of mild scoliosis could slow or stop curvature progression before skeletal maturity, thereby improving long-term outcomes in adulthood.

- **Objective**: To update the 2004 US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation on screening for idiopathic scoliosis in asymptomatic adolescents.

- **Evidence review**: The USPSTF reviewed the evidence on the benefits and harms of screening for and treatment of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis.

- **Findings**: The USPSTF found no direct evidence on screening for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis and health outcomes and no evidence on the harms of screening. The USPSTF found inadequate evidence on treatment with exercise and surgery. It found adequate evidence that treatment with bracing may slow curvature progression in adolescents with mild or moderate curvature severity (Cobb angle < 40° to 50°); however, evidence on the association between reduction in spinal curvature in adolescence and long-term health outcomes in adulthood is inadequate. The USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the harms of treatment.

### Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis in siblings treated by surgical deformity correction [^116SmN7b]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. Global Research & Reviews (2024). Low credibility.

The surgical treatment of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) was primarily aimed at correcting three-dimensional deformity and preventing curve progression. Currently, posterior instrumented fusion with deformity correction using rod derotation provides favorable outcomes regarding radiological and clinical parameters. The main goals of surgical treatment in AIS patients with severe scoliotic curves are to prevent curve progression, restore coronal and sagittal balance, and preserve as many motion segments as possible. However, due to cosmetic concerns and the desire for motion preservation, new approaches are developing in the treatment of moderate curves. These include minimally invasive scoliosis surgery using a posterior approach or vertebral body tethering for the surgical treatment of AIS with moderate curves. Both siblings in this case underwent standard open scoliosis surgery due to severe degrees of scoliotic deformity, resulting in favorable outcomes.

In conclusion, we report on two siblings with AIS who underwent surgical treatment for different types of curves. They showed favorable outcomes following deformity correction with posterior instrumented fusion. This rare case supports the underlying basis of genetic heterogeneity as a complex polygenic model.

### Updated criteria for fusion level selection in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis including use of three-dimensional analysis [^116zYiax]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2023). High credibility.

The development of new technologies and an enhanced understanding of the three-dimensional deformity in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis has led to advances in the surgical management of the condition. Posterior spinal approaches with pedicle screw constructs are now the standard of care because they allow for powerful rotation maneuvers with three-column deformity correction. Selective fusion of the main curve, while allowing for spontaneous correction of compensatory curves, should be attempted whenever possible to limit fusion size and preserve spinal mobility. Recent research provides updated criteria to determine optimal candidates for selective fusion. These criteria must be weighed against patient goals and patient-specific factors to limit complications and maximize the chances of successful deformity correction.

### Current concepts in the orthopaedic management of Duchenne muscular dystrophy [^117VZpvP]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. Global Research & Reviews (2024). Low credibility.

Vigilant oversight of scoliosis progression is essential in the management of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), especially during the ambulatory stage. This entails a dual approach involving clinical examinations and annual radiographic evaluations to track changes in spinal curvature. The risk of vertebral fractures is a concern both with and without steroid therapy. Such fractures often stem from postural changes inherent to DMD coupled with steroid use and can also aggravate the spinal curvature. Consequently, any presentation of back pain during patient visits necessitates a radiographic examination for the presence of vertebral fractures or additional scoliosis progression. The use of bisphosphonates may be considered to prevent fractures, slow their progression, and manage pain.

As the condition evolves and spinal curvature becomes evident, the recommended frequency of monitoring adjusts based on the patient's skeletal maturity. Skeletally immature patients are advised to undergo biannual radiographic assessments to ensure any progression is promptly identified and managed. Conversely, for those who have reached skeletal maturity, annual assessments suffice for the identification of notable changes. This tailored monitoring is particularly important as patients transition to the late nonambulatory stage of the disease. At this juncture, spinal evaluations become an integral part of every clinical visit, with a minimum of annual radiographic examinations to ensure comprehensive oversight of scoliosis.

### Growing-rod graduates: Lessons learned from ninety-nine patients who completed lengthening [^1118Ysxa]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery. American Volume (2013). Low credibility.

Growing-rod spinal instrumentation systems are a valuable tool for managing severe early-onset scoliosis. However, there is little information about the end point of treatment.

- **Methods**: A multicenter early-onset scoliosis database was searched to identify patients who had undergone treatment with growing rods and either had a final operative procedure or were still being treated with the growing rods after reaching skeletal maturity, defined as fourteen years of age or older. Clinical, radiographic, and operative data were analyzed.

- **Results**: Ninety-nine patients met the inclusion criteria, and ninety-two (93%) of them had a final operative procedure. The remaining seven patients (7%) were older than fourteen years but had not undergone a final procedure. Of the ninety-two patients who had a final procedure, seventy-nine (86%) had an instrumented fusion, nine (10%) had growing-rod exchanges and fusion in situ, three (3%) had the growing rods left in place and fusion in situ, and one (1%) had only growing-rod removal. The mean age (and standard deviation) at the final fusion was 12.4 ± 1.9 years. In forty-four (55%) of eighty patients for whom the information was available, the number of vertebral levels fused was the same as the number of vertebral levels spanned by the growing rods. The percent correction of the curve after final fusion was none or minimal (≤ 20%) in eleven (18%) of the sixty-two patients for whom sufficient-quality radiographs were available, moderate (21% to 50%) in thirty (48%), and substantial (≥ 51%) in nine (15%).

### Comparison of best versus worst clinical outcomes for adult spinal deformity surgery: A retrospective review of a prospectively collected, multicenter database with 2-year follow-up [^1168W5tM]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Spine (2015). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to compare patients with adult spinal deformity (ASD) with the best versus worst clinical outcomes following surgical treatment to identify distinguishing factors that may prove useful for patient counseling and optimization of clinical outcomes. Although recent studies suggest that average clinical outcomes are improved following surgery for selected ASD patients, these outcomes span a broad range. Few studies have specifically addressed factors that may predict favorable clinical outcomes.

- **Methods**: This is a retrospective review of a prospectively collected, multicenter database of consecutively enrolled patients with ASD who were treated operatively. Inclusion criteria were age > 18 years and ASD. For patients with a minimum of 2-year follow-up, those with best versus worst outcomes were compared separately based on Scoliosis Research Society-22 (SRS-22) and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) scores. Only patients with a baseline SRS-22 ≤ 3.5 or ODI ≥ 30 were included to minimize ceiling/floor effects. Best and worst outcomes were defined for SRS-22 (≥ 4.5 and ≤ 2.5, respectively) and ODI (≤ 15 and ≥ 50, respectively).

- **Results**: Of 257 patients who met the inclusion criteria, 227 (88%) had complete baseline and 2-year follow-up SRS-22 and ODI outcome scores and radiographic imaging and were analyzed in the present study. Of these 227 patients, 187 had baseline SRS-22 scores ≤ 3.5, and 162 had baseline ODI scores ≥ 30. For the SRS-22, best and worst outcomes criteria were met at follow-up for 25 and 27 patients, respectively.

### Operative treatment of severe scoliosis in symptomatic adults: Multicenter assessment of outcomes and complications with minimum 2-year follow-up [^1138bKof]. Neurosurgery (2021). Low credibility.

Few reports focus on adults with severe scoliosis. The objective of this study was to report surgical outcomes and complications for adults with severe scoliosis.

- **Methods**: A multicenter, retrospective review was performed on operatively treated adults with severe scoliosis, defined as having a minimum coronal Cobb angle of thoracic ≥ 75°, thoracolumbar ≥ 50°, or lumbar ≥ 50°.

- **Results**: Of 178 consecutive patients, 146 (82%; thoracic = 8, thoracolumbar = 88, lumbar = 50) achieved a minimum 2-year follow-up (mean age = 53.9 ± 13.2 years, 92% women). Operative details included posterior-only procedures (58%), 3-column osteotomy (14%), iliac fixation (72%), and a mean posterior fusion of 13.2 ± 3.7 levels.

	- Global coronal alignment improved significantly from 3.8 to 2.8 cm (P = 0.001) and maximum coronal Cobb showed significant improvement (P ≤ .020): thoracic (84° to 57°; correction = 32%), thoracolumbar (67° to 35°; correction = 48%), lumbar (61° to 29°; correction = 53%). Sagittal alignment improved significantly (P < .001), most notably for lumbar: C7-sagittal vertical axis from 6.7 to 2.5 cm, and pelvic incidence-lumbar lordosis mismatch from 18° to 3°.

	- Health-related quality-of-life (HRQL) improved significantly (P < .001), most notably for lumbar: Oswestry Disability Index decreased from 44.4 ± 20.5 to 26.1 ± 18.3, Short Form-36 Physical Component Summary increased from 30.2 ± 10.8 to 39.9 ± 9.8, and Scoliosis Research Society-22r Total improved from 2.9 ± 0.7 to 3.8 ± 0.7. Minimal clinically important difference and substantial clinical benefit thresholds were achieved in 36% to 75% and 29% to 51%, respectively.

	- Ninety-four (64%) patients experienced ≥ 1 complication (total = 191, 92 minor/99 major, most common = rod fracture [13.0%]). Fifty-seven reoperations were performed, due to…

### Directed versus nondirected standing postures in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis: its impact on curve magnitude, alignment, and clinical decision-making [^112D7cZa]. Spine (2023). Low credibility.

Data collection was performed on the day of consultation. The demographic and growth data included age, sex, body height (cm), arm span (cm), weight (kg), age of menarche, and skeletal maturity using Risser staging, which consists of Stage 4+ referring to the capping of the iliac crest apophysis before its complete fusion graded as Stage 5. The curve type indicating the location of the major curve based on the apex as thoracic (T11 and above) or lumbar (T12 and below) and treatment prescribed were also recorded.

Primary outcome measures were the difference in major curve Cobb angle between directed and nondirected postures and alignment profile changes between positioning. A Cobb angle difference of > 5° was defined as clinically impactful to account for measurement error, whereas differences in coronal and sagittal balance, cervical, thoracic, and lumbar alignment parameters, and spinopelvic parameters were assessed.

Secondary outcome measures included the prevalence rate of major curve Cobb angle changes between the two positions: from ≥ 25° (in directed positioning) to 40° was also observed. The thresholds of 25° and 40° were selected for the evaluation of whether clinical decision-making for brace initiation or the consideration of surgical correction was required.

### The genetic epidemiology of idiopathic scoliosis [^112hE3eP]. European Spine Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Idiopathic scoliosis (IS) is a complex developmental syndrome that constitutes the largest subgroup of human spinal curvatures [Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM): 181800]. First described by Hippocrates in "On the Articulations" (Part 47), IS has been the subject of ongoing research, yet its etiology remains enigmatic. Idiopathic scoliosis is marked by phenotypic complexity, including variations in curve morphology and magnitude, age of onset, and rate of progression. The prognosis ranges from an increase in curve magnitude to stabilization or resolution with growth. Genetic factors are known to play a role, as observed in twin studies and singleton multigenerational families. A recent study of monozygotic and dizygotic twins from the Swedish twin registry estimated that overall genetic effects accounted for 38% of the observed phenotypic variance, leaving the remaining 62% to environmental influences. Genetic complexity in idiopathic scoliosis is further inferred from inconsistent inheritance, discordance among monozygotic twins, and highly variable results from genetic studies.

The standard of care for scoliosis has not changed significantly in the past three decades, evolving from initiating observation to bracing and to spinal fusion surgery as a last resort. The healthcare costs of bracing, hospitalization, surgery, and chronic back pain are substantial. An understanding of the genetics underlying the disorder would help in leading to earlier diagnosis, identification of at-risk individuals, and more effective preventive and/or therapeutic choices.

### Are higher global alignment and proportion scores associated with increased risks of mechanical complications after adult spinal deformity surgery? An external validation [^114ry78c]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2021). Low credibility.

We performed a retrospective analysis of a previous prospective, multicenter study that recruited patients after fusion for adult spinal deformity, with a minimum of 2 years follow-up as part of the Scoli-RISK-1 trial. From this cohort, the GAP score was applied to patients who fulfilled these inclusion criteria: (1) age ≥ 18 years, (2) at least one of the following radiological parameters preoperatively: scoliosis ≥ 20°, sagittal vertical axis (SVA) ≥ 5 cm, thoracic kyphosis > 60°, or pelvic tilt > 25°, (3) undergone ≥ four-vertebrae posterior instrumented fusion, and (4) minimum of 2 years follow-up.

Patients were excluded from this secondary analysis if they had neuromuscular disease, active infections, trauma or tumors, if a full-length radiograph was not available at baseline, during the early postoperative period (between 3 and 12 weeks), or at the latest follow-up, or if the planned uppermost instrumented vertebra was within a previously fused segment.

There were 272 patients in the original Scoli-RISK-1 cohort. Patients with fewer than four levels of fusion (0.7%; 2 of 272), those who dropped out before the 2-year timepoint (20%; 55 of 272), those without postoperative whole-spine standing radiographs at 2 years (24%; 64 of 272), and those whose GAP score could not be calculated on 3- to 12-week radiographs because of missing data (14%; 37 of 272) were excluded, leaving 159 patients (58%) to be included in the analysis (Table 1). The baseline characteristics and radiographic parameters used to calculate the GAP score were similar among the patients.

### Surgical sagittal correction of symptomatic sweeping thoracolumbar lordosis in an adolescent with congenital kyphoscoliosis [^111anGWZ]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2025). High credibility.

Severe kyphoscoliosis, characterized by spinal curvatures exceeding 70°, is frequently associated with notable respiratory compromise due to restrictive lung disease. This condition can lead to reduced lung volumes and impaired gas exchange, often necessitating interventions such as noninvasive ventilation or even surgical procedures such as spinal fusion or thoracoplasty later in the patient's clinical course to improve respiratory function and prevent additional deterioration. It has also been associated with diminished quality of life, as measured by the Child Health Questionnaire in the domains of physical limitations and caregiver burdens.

Although compensatory thoracolumbar lordosis is not considered a standard indication for surgery when treating patients with thoracic congenital kyphoscoliosis, surgical intervention has been described in patients with lordoscoliosis. Kanagaraju et al. described a patient with rigid congenital right thoracolumbar lordoscoliosis (coronal Cobb angle: 105° and thoracic lordosis −10°) who underwent a staged procedure including halo traction and eventual posterior spinal fusion (T1-L4) to improve alignment in the context of respiratory failure. In a related case, Ha et al. described a 2-year-old boy with hyperlordosis of the thoracic spine who underwent posterior laminectomy and, later, osteotomy combined with anterior fusion to address his scoliosis and hyperlordosis. Although scoliosis correction was achieved, the hyperlordosis persisted, leading to additional respiratory decline. At age 12, posterior spinal instrumented fusion was necessary to address ongoing issues.

### Congenital scoliosis: Etiology and associations [^115Jd1Vo]. Spine (2009). Low credibility.

This study is a literature review aimed at providing an overview of congenital scoliosis and associated conditions.

- **Summary of background data**: The etiology of congenital scoliosis is unknown. A variety of factors have been implicated in the development of vertebral abnormalities, which provide clues to the origin of congenital scoliosis.

- **Methods**: A search of PubMed using the keywords "congenital scoliosis", "etiology", and "genetics" was performed.

- **Results**: Environmental factors, genetics, vitamin deficiency, chemicals, and drugs — singly or in combination — have all been implicated in the development of vertebral abnormalities. Whatever the cause, the physiologic injury occurs early in the embryologic period, well before the development of cartilage and bone. The resulting defects can lead to full or partial fusion or lack of development of the vertebrae, which, in turn, can cause a curvature that may be progressive during the growth of the child.

- **Conclusion**: The origin of congenital scoliosis may be environmental, genetic, or a combination of factors. Research on these various factors continues. Early identification and management of concomitant defects can improve the patient's quality of life.

### Developing outcome measures for pediatric deformity surgery [^113rqybf]. Spine (2007). Low credibility.

This review article discusses the development of outcome measures for pediatric spinal deformity.

- **Objective**: To explore the role of patient-based outcomes and process measures in pediatric spinal deformity patients.

- **Summary of background data**: Several health-related quality of life (HRQOL) questionnaires assess, from patients' perspectives, the effectiveness of spinal deformity correction. The SRS instrument is the most prominent HRQOL tool used in North American adolescent scoliosis studies today. However, these patient-based outcomes and perceptions do not necessarily correlate with process measurements, particularly in the area of increasing spinal deformity correction being achieved with newer, more powerful pedicle screw instrumentation. Furthermore, spinal deformity presenting during infancy or early childhood poses a particular challenge for developing useful evidence-based outcomes tools.

- **Methods**: The rationale for patient-based outcome development in pediatric spinal deformity is explored, highlighting its important association with process measures.

- **Results**: Newer HRQOL tools are under development that may better recognize and differentiate changes in adolescent patients' appearances before and after surgery. For early-onset spinal deformity patients, newer process measures for periodic outcome assessment, such as volume measurement of lung parenchyma and spine/chest cage measurement, are being developed.

- **Conclusion**: Ultimately, both patient and process measures are necessary to fully evaluate the results of pediatric spinal deformity.

### Assessing clinical trunk change with surface topography: Anterior scoliosis correction as a model to evaluate curve progression [^112d1qfu]. European Spine Journal (2021). Low credibility.

Previous work has suggested that surface topography can be used for repeated measurements of deformity during curve monitoring following an initial radiograph. Changes in deformity during natural curve progression may be subtle. An important preemptive question to answer is whether topography can follow a large change in spine deformity, as in scoliosis correction. We assess the ability of surface topography to track the evolution of spine deformity during anterior scoliosis correction relative to traditional radiographs. Anterior scoliosis correction was chosen for this analysis because it changes the shape of the trunk without leaving a surgical scar and muscle atrophy along the posterior spine.

- **Methods**: Following IRB approval, 18 patients aged 14.6 ± 2.0 years at surgery were enrolled in a retrospective review of coronal radiographs and topographic scans acquired before and after scoliosis correction. Radiographic and topographic measures for the coronal curve angle before and after surgery were compared.

- **Results**: Surface topography estimates correlate with radiographic measures of the pre- (r = 0.7890, CI = [0.4989 0.9201], p < 0.00001), postsurgical (r = 0.7485, CI = [0.4329 0.9006], p = 0.0004), and the change in the coronal curve angle (r = 0.6744, CI = [0.3028 0.8680], p = 0.0021) due to surgery.

- **Conclusions**: We provide evidence open for further extension that topography can follow changes in the coronal curve angle comparably to radiographs.

- **Level of evidence**: Level IV.

### Does three-dimensional printing plus pedicle guider technology in severe congenital scoliosis facilitate accurate and efficient pedicle screw placement [^113mNZwE]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2019). Low credibility.

Three-dimensional (3-D) printing offers the opportunity to create patient-specific guides for pedicle screw placement based on CT-generated models. This technology might allow for more accurate placement of pedicle screws in patients with severe congenital scoliosis who have rotated vertebrae and small pedicles, but to our knowledge, this premise has not been tested.

- **Questions/purposes**:
	(1) Is the use of 3-D printing and pedicle guider technology as or more accurate than the use of the freehand technique for pedicle screw placement in patients with severe congenital scoliosis? (2) Does surgical time differ with the use of these guiders? (3) Are complications less common in patients treated with this new approach to pedicle screw placement?

- **Methods**:
	- A prospective controlled study was conducted of patients with severe congenital scoliosis (major curve ≥ 90°) from June 2016 to June 2018. During this period, we treated 93 patients with congenital scoliosis; 32 had severe scoliosis with a major curve ≥ 90°. The patients were divided into a pedicle guider group (n = 15) and a control group (n = 17) based on their willingness to use pedicle guider technology, which was considered a research technology. With the numbers available, there were no between-group differences in terms of age, sex, BMI, or parameters related to curve severity or flexibility, and all patients in both groups had severe curves. Preoperative and postoperative low-dose CT scans were performed in the two groups. In the pedicle guider group, custom software was used to design the pedicle guider.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis, more specifically with respect to diagnostic imaging, SOSORT 2018 guidelines recommend placing the patient's upper extremities in a position to uncover the upper thoracic spine on radiographic lateral view:

- **45 degrees angle flexion of the arms**: Elbows extended and hands resting on support to preserve the sagittal curvature of the spine.

- **Arms crossed over the breasts**.

- **Hand resting on the ipsilateral shoulder**: Without pressing it.

### Radiographic measurement techniques [^112wAzKC]. Neurosurgery (2008). Low credibility.

The evaluation and treatment of spinal deformities begin with the accurate measurement of appropriate spinal parameters. The surgeon must ensure that the patient is positioned properly for all necessary X-ray scans and that the proper studies are completed. The relevant measurements must be identified and recorded for each study. Understanding the proper measurement techniques will increase the accuracy and reliability of the measurements. From these precise measurements, the surgeon can begin to determine key characteristics of the deformity and develop an appropriate treatment plan.

### Comparison of T1-S1 spine height of postoperative rib-based implant patients with age-matched peers [^117DL435]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2020). Low credibility.

Severe early-onset scoliosis leads to deficient spine height, thoracic growth inhibition, and ultimately, pulmonary compromise. Rib-based growing instrumentation seeks to correct thoracic deformities by addressing the spinal deformity, adding height, increasing thoracic volume, and facilitating continual spinal growth until maturity. However, the extent of growth in these patients relative to their peers is unknown.

- **Methods**: Sixty patients underwent surgical intervention for early-onset scoliosis and were assessed via radiographic measurements of coronal T1-S1 height and major curve angle before implantation and again at the most recent follow-up (minimum 2 years). T1-S1 measurements were compared with age-matched peers to assess growth differences, and clinical information was evaluated for relevant parameters.

- **Results**: The average age of the cohort at initial surgery and most recent follow-up was 4.4 ± 3.8 and 10.0 ± 4.4 years, respectively. There was an average increase in T1-S1 height of 13.1 ± 11.1mm per year, with the majority of growth occurring in the first 2 years following implantation, and an improvement in the major curve from 68 ± 8 to 53 ± 7 degrees. Overall, 77% of patients saw improvements in the major curve at the most recent follow-up. A statistically significant greater percent of expected growth was observed in congenital compared to neuromuscular scoliosis (P < 0.001). Additionally, a weak negative correlation was noted between the number of surgical lengthenings and T1-S1 growth.

- **Conclusions**: Rib-based growing instrumentation in early-onset scoliosis shows promise in promoting spinal growth and correcting deformities, although growth relative to peers varies.

### Surgical risk assessment and prevention in elderly spinal deformity patients [^114q2Qf9]. Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation (2019). Low credibility.

An informative review of the literature was performed using biomedical databases across four vendor platforms and the World Health Organization's Global Health Library website. MEDLINE and MEDLINE In Process & Daily Updates, along with International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, were searched via the OVID platform. The EBSCO platform was utilized for searching the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL Complete) and SocINDEX, as well as the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Methodology Register, and Cochrane Clinical Answers. ProQuest's interface was employed to search the PQ Health and Medical database. Research was also conducted through the Science Citation Index and Social Sciences Citations Index via Web of Science.

The research team identified all pertinent concepts and consulted on specific terminology. Search strategies were piloted and refined based on the team's reviews of sample results. All search strategies were created by the medical librarian co-author, S.C.S., and the final strategies were run in early to mid-October 2018. Controlled vocabulary terms were combined with advanced text word search techniques, including adjacency, nesting, and truncation for each main concept. Specific Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) utilized and exploded (to incorporate more specific headings under the MeSH terms) for concept one included: spinal curvatures, scoliosis, kyphosis, lordosis, or spinal diseases specific to spine deformity, degeneration, and misalignment. The surgical subheading was used in some search strings.

### Effect of core-based exercise in people with scoliosis: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^1156BkZW]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2021). Low credibility.

Scoliosis is a musculoskeletal disorder that manifests as a sideways curvature of the spine (measured by the Cobb angle) and occurs in both adolescents and adults, with a female-male distribution ratio greater than 8:1 among individuals above the age of 10 years. The prevalence of scoliosis in school children under the age of 16 varies from 3% to 5%, and in adults, it ranges from 1.4% to 20%. Generally, scoliosis is classified as functional and structural, based on whether the curve with bending is fixed. Functional scoliosis refers to a temporary curvature in the spine without rotation of the vertebrae, while structural scoliosis is a multifactorial disorder associated with a loss of flexibility in one or more segments of the curved spinal column. Ten to fifteen percent of adolescents with mild idiopathic scoliosis have a risk of the curve worsening, which is considered to be linked to underlying biomechanical and morphologic alterations along the trunk segment with actions of improper mechanical forces and may sometimes cause complications, including cosmetic deformity, physical function decline, and poor health-related quality of life.

Exercise programs aiming to relieve clinical symptoms and prevent curve progression have been widely implemented in recent years. It appears that core-based exercise is one of the most promising physiotherapeutic approaches to contract muscles for optimal realignment of the spine and spinal stability that counteracts curve progression. Additionally, it was recommended by the…

### ACR appropriateness criteria scoliosis-child [^115xNSDS]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2019). High credibility.

Scoliosis is frequently encountered in childhood, with a prevalence of 2%. The majority of cases are idiopathic, without vertebral segmentation anomaly, dysraphism, neuromuscular abnormality, skeletal dysplasia, tumor, or infection. As a complement to clinical assessment, radiography is the primary imaging modality used to classify scoliosis and subsequently monitor its progression and response to treatment. MRI is utilized selectively to assess for neural axis abnormalities in those at higher risk, including those with congenital scoliosis, early onset idiopathic scoliosis, and adolescent idiopathic scoliosis with certain risk factors. CT, although not routinely employed in the initial evaluation, may have a select role in characterizing bone anomalies of congenital scoliosis and in perioperative planning.

The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of medical literature from peer-reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Validity and reliability of active shape models for the estimation of Cobb angle in patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis [^116Ux1EA]. Journal of digital imaging (2008). Low credibility.

Choosing the most suitable treatment for scoliosis relies heavily on accurate and reproducible Cobb angle measurement from successive radiographs. The objective is to reduce variability of Cobb angle measurement by reducing user intervention and bias. Custom software to increase automation of the Cobb angle measurement from posteroanterior radiographs was developed using active shape models.

Validity and reliability of the automated system against a manual and semiautomated measurement method was conducted by two examiners, each performing measurements on three occasions from a test set (N = 22). A training set (N = 47) of radiographs, representative of curves seen in a scoliosis clinic, was used to train the software to recognize vertebrae from T4 to L4. Images with a maximum Cobb angle between 20 degrees and 50 degrees, excluding surgical cases, were selected for training and test sets.

Automated Cobb angles were calculated using best-fit slopes of the detected vertebrae endplates. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and standard error of measurement (SEM) showed high intraexaminer (ICC > 0.90, SEM 2 degrees-3 degrees) and interexaminer (ICC > 0.82, SEM 2 degrees-4 degrees) reliability, but poor intermethod reliability (ICC = 0.30, SEM 8 degrees-9 degrees). The automated method underestimated large curves. The reliability improved (ICC = 0.70, SEM 4 degrees-5 degrees) with the exclusion of the four largest curves (> 40 degrees) in the test set.

The automated method was reliable for moderate-sized curves, and it did detect vertebrae in larger curves with a modified training set of data.

### Is there a need for anterior release for 70–90 degrees masculine thoracic curves in adolescent scoliosis [^1131gZTq]. European Spine Journal (2004). Low credibility.

Large and stiff thoracic scoliotic curves in adolescents typically represent a classic indication for anterior release followed by posterior instrumentation. However, third-generation segmental spinal instrumentations have shown increased correction of thoracic curves. As a result, the indication for an anterior release may not be required even in large and stiff thoracic curves.

The objective of the study was to retrospectively analyze the results of third-generation segmental posterior instrumentation in large and stiff thoracic curves, and to compare these results with literature on anterior release followed by posterior instrumentation. An independent observer, who had not participated in any of the cases, reviewed our electronic database of adolescent scoliosis surgery (Scolisoft) with the following query: thoracic curves with a Cobb angle between 70 degrees and 90 degrees, and posterior surgery only. He was able to identify 19 patients whose thoracic curves measured between 70 degrees and 90 degrees. Out of these, four had convex-side bending Cobb angle values of less than 45 degrees and were not included in the study, as they were judged too flexible.

Fifteen patients (aged 11–18 years, mean 13.6 years) with thoracic scoliosis remained in the study, with average Cobb angles of 78.5 degrees and a flexibility index of 32.5% (range, 19–42%). The mean follow-up period was 32 months (range, 18–64 months). Classic parameters of deformity correction were analyzed. The average operative time was 314 minutes, and the mean total blood loss was 1,875 ml.

### Experience with an online prospective database on adolescent idiopathic scoliosis: Development and implementation [^112Xu7MR]. European Spine Journal (2008). Low credibility.

The process of establishing variables to be entered into the database started with the review, classification, and prioritization of goals for surgical planning and implementation. For example, surgical planning of AIS includes classification of the curve (Lenke Type 1, 2, 3, etc), bone maturity (Risser's sign), Cobb angle, curve flexibility, age of the patient, and menarche onset. Additionally, variables deemed important for the evaluation of the surgical procedure, such as complications, type of instrumentation used, number of days in hospital, SRS morbidity and mortality dataset, and SRS quality of life questionnaire responses, were also included. Variables are arranged so that the order of occurrence coincides with the progression of a typical surgical patient's visits, i.e. pre-op, post-op, and follow-up.

The database was developed using the dot.net platform and SQL Server from Microsoft. To address the possibility of high user volume, a robust server architecture was implemented. This included the use of a server to store the database, which would be accessed by registered users internationally via the World Wide Web. Key elements considered important were the network server, database structure, security, ease of access, time-efficient data access, and the ability to enter various types of data in different formats. To accommodate these requirements, Scolisoft was designed as a multi-functional database system.

### Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis [^114csBB3]. Nature Reviews, Disease Primers (2015). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on adolescent idiopathic scoliosis:

- **Definition**: Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis is a three-dimensional deformity of the spine, characterized by a lateral curvature of the spine greater than 10 degrees, as measured via the Cobb angle. This condition typically presents in otherwise normal individuals aged 10–18 years with no identifiable cause.

- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis remains unclear, but it is believed to involve a combination of genetic, biomechanical, and neurological factors. Abnormalities in the growth of vertebrae and the surrounding soft tissues may lead to asymmetric spinal growth, resulting in curvature. Genetic factors have been implicated, with disease-causing and predisposing variants of SLC6A9 encoding the glycine transporter 1 (GLYT1), and susceptibility loci on chromosome 10q24.31 identified in some patients. Additionally, abnormalities in brain development and cerebral cortical thinning have been suggested as potential contributing factors.

- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis in the US is estimated at 522.5 per 100,000 person-years. The prevalence of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis globally is estimated at 0.47–5.2%.

- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis include a family history of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis, female sex, and vitamin D deficiency.

- **Disease course**: Clinically, adolescent idiopathic scoliosis may be asymptomatic or present with cosmetic concerns, back pain, or respiratory issues in severe cases.
