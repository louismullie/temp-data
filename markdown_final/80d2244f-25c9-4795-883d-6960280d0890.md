## Question

appropriate vitamin d dose for 61 year old male with liver damage

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the appropriate vitamin D dose for a 61-year-old male with liver damage. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the patient's risk for deficiency and the pathophysiology in liver disease. Then, I should verify screening and target 25(OH)D levels. Next, I will examine formulation choice and whether to use daily versus bolus dosing. After that, I need to calculate an initial treatment dose and define a maintenance plan. I will then set a monitoring protocol and consider special circumstances such as cholestasis or decompensated cirrhosis, review outcome evidence, and finally double-check safety and toxicity thresholds before summarizing a practical plan.

> Let me first confirm the risk context and mechanisms. Chronic liver disease commonly impairs vitamin D metabolism via reduced hepatic 25-hydroxylation, cholestasis-related malabsorption, and lower vitamin D–binding protein synthesis, with deficiency rates reported in the majority of cirrhotics and correlating with Child-Pugh and MELD severity, so this 61-year-old with "liver damage" is high risk for deficiency and bone complications [^111tPxE5] [^115w5xdT]. I should also remember that vitamin D activation requires hepatic and renal hydroxylation, and liver disease affects the first step, further supporting supplementation when low levels are documented.

> I need to check the screening approach and targets. The Endocrine Society recommends measuring serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D to assess status in at-risk patients, defining deficiency as less than 20 ng/mL and insufficiency as 20–30 ng/mL, with a reasonable target of greater than 30 ng/mL for musculoskeletal health and potential extraskeletal benefits in liver disease, recognizing some debate about "optimal" levels [^1123HSa4] [^114Hfpqn] [^112NYuEb] [^111tPxE5]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; routine screening in everyone is not advised, but targeted screening in high-risk groups like those with liver dysfunction remains appropriate here [^112vxbMP].

> Next, I should review which vitamin D to use and how to dose it. Let me verify: cholecalciferol (D3) is generally more potent and sustained than ergocalciferol (D2) for raising 25(OH)D, including in cirrhosis cohorts where single-dose D3 outperformed D2, so I should prefer D3 [^111NsF98] [^112pfiiR]. But wait, what about bolus regimens? The 2024 Endocrine Society guideline advises daily lower-dose vitamin D over non-daily higher-dose therapy in adults ≥ 50 because bolus dosing may adversely alter metabolism and increase falls, so daily dosing is safer here [^115txpG3] [^111NsF98].

> Now I will calculate an initial treatment dose. My first thought is to use 50,000 IU weekly for 8 weeks as older protocols suggested, or 6,000 IU/day for short-term repletion in deficiency, but wait, let me verify the current safety context for a 61-year-old with liver disease: contemporary guidance prefers daily dosing and cautions against bolus, and standard adult needs are around 600–800 IU/day with 1,500–2,000 IU/day typically required to maintain levels above 30 ng/mL in at-risk adults, so a practical initial range is 2,000–4,000 IU/day of D3, titrated to response while avoiding routine bolus therapy [^116uJcoA] [^114Hfpqn] [^115txpG3] [^111NsF98]. I should double-check higher-need scenarios: in patients with malabsorption, obesity, or medications affecting metabolism, the Endocrine Society notes 2–3× higher doses may be needed, sometimes 6,000–10,000 IU/day short term under supervision, but I would reserve that for documented refractory deficiency with close monitoring [^115rP1Fz].

> After repletion, I should define maintenance. Let me think about maintenance targets: once 25(OH)D is above 30 ng/mL, maintenance with 1,500–2,000 IU/day is reasonable, with down-titration to 1,000 IU/day if levels stabilize near 40 ng/mL and clinical risk improves, reassessing adherence and absorption if levels drift [^111tPxE5] [^116uJcoA]. I need to ensure we maintain daily dosing rather than intermittent boluses for safety in older adults [^115txpG3].

> Next, I should review monitoring. I will now examine a schedule: check baseline 25(OH)D and calcium, recheck 25(OH)D in 8–12 weeks to gauge response, then space to every 6 months once stable, with serum calcium checked at baseline, early after initiation or dose increase, and periodically thereafter, since hypercalcemia is the key toxicity signal [^1123HSa4] [^112KAZmH]. I should confirm safety thresholds; if 25(OH)D exceeds roughly 80–100 ng/mL or calcium is elevated, I would hold or reduce the dose and reassess for sources of inadvertent excess intake or drug interactions [^112KAZmH] [^111PQS1T].

> I need to address special situations. Let me consider severity: compensated cirrhosis typically responds to 2,000–4,000 IU/day of D3, whereas decompensated disease or cholestasis can involve malabsorption, possibly requiring the higher end of daily dosing or consideration of calcifediol with specialist input, but hold on, I should verify that pediatric cholestasis data are not overgeneralized to adults, so I will use adult clinical judgment and careful monitoring when malabsorption is suspected [^113tCSKK] [^111NsF98]. I should double-check interactions such as cholestyramine impairing absorption and enzyme-inducing drugs increasing requirements, and add calcium for bone health prevention per liver disease nutrition guidance when indicated [^115rP1Fz] [^117TSnbQ].

> But wait, what outcomes should we expect beyond correcting the lab value. The evidence in chronic liver disease is mixed: vitamin D reliably raises 25(OH)D but has inconsistent effects on liver histology, enzymes, and bone endpoints, with Cochrane reviews showing limited high-certainty benefits, some RCTs showing glycemic improvements in cirrhosis, others showing no change in BMD or NAFLD endpoints over months, and one longer NAFLD trial suggesting improvements in transient elastography metrics, so I should set expectations primarily around bone and deficiency correction rather than guaranteed liver disease modification [^115JswHe] [^113dajdL] [^117C2589] [^111jWCqP] [^114Rpn7D] [^115Kpd4V]. I should confirm that contemporary hepatology nutrition guidance still considers vitamin D supplementation reasonable in CLD when levels are low, aligning with our plan [^117TSnbQ].

> I should double-check safety boundaries. Daily intakes up to 4,000 IU/day are generally within the tolerable upper intake for chronic use in most adults, with RCT data up to 10,000 IU/day showing increased biochemical hypercalciuria and occasional mild hypercalcemia that resolved on retesting, underscoring the importance of calcium monitoring and avoiding unsupervised mega-doses, especially in older adults at fall risk with bolus regimens [^112KAZmH] [^115hjNBv] [^111NsF98] [^115txpG3]. Symptomatic toxicity remains rare but is driven by very high cumulative dosing or dosing errors, reinforcing careful product selection, prescription clarity, and monitoring in this high-risk group [^111PQS1T] [^114jjzc7].

> Putting this together, my practical, safety-aware plan is as follows: measure baseline 25(OH)D and calcium, start cholecalciferol at 2,000–4,000 IU daily with food, avoid weekly or monthly bolus regimens, recheck 25(OH)D in 8–12 weeks and titrate to keep levels above 30 ng/mL, then maintain typically at 1,500–2,000 IU daily while monitoring calcium and adjusting if hypercalcemia or very high 25(OH)D occurs, and seek hepatology or endocrine input if malabsorption or decompensation necessitates higher dosing or alternative formulations such as calcifediol under close supervision [^1123HSa4] [^115txpG3] [^111NsF98] [^116uJcoA] [^112KAZmH]. Hold on, I should verify adherence and potential drug interactions at each visit, and if bone health risk is present, integrate calcium intake and broader osteoporosis prevention consistent with liver disease nutrition guidance [^117TSnbQ] [^115rP1Fz].

For a 61-year-old male with liver damage, **1,500–2,000 IU/day of vitamin D3** [^114Hfpqn] [^116uJcoA] is appropriate to achieve and maintain serum 25(OH)D ≥ 30 ng/mL, as liver disease impairs 25-hroxylation [^1167Q1RY] and increases deficiency risk [^111tPxE5] [^114jEzXa]. If deficiency is present, use **50,000 IU weekly for 8 weeks** [^114Hfpqn], then reassess and continue 1,500–2,000 IU/day for maintenance [^111tPxE5] [^114Hfpqn]. Monitor serum 25(OH)D, calcium, and liver function every 3–6 months to avoid hypercalcemia and adjust dosing as needed [^112KAZmH]. Avoid intermittent high-dose regimens due to increased fall risk in older adults [^111NsF98] [^115txpG3].

## Vitamin D metabolism and liver disease

Vitamin D metabolism involves **two hydroxylation steps** [^1167Q1RY]. The **first hydroxylation** occurs in the liver, converting vitamin D to 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D], the main circulating form and marker of vitamin D status. The **second hydroxylation** occurs in the kidney, converting 25(OH)D to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25(OH)2D], the active form [^1167Q1RY]. Liver damage **impairs the first step**, leading to reduced 25(OH)D levels and an increased risk of vitamin D deficiency [^115miP6b].

---

## Prevalence and clinical implications of vitamin D deficiency in liver disease

Vitamin D deficiency is **highly prevalent** in patients with chronic liver disease, including cirrhosis and NAFLD [^117HT7F7] [^111n36ov], and is associated with:

- **Increased risk**: Hepatic decompensation, infections, and mortality [^111tPxE5].

- **Bone disease**: Osteomalacia [^111tPxE5] and osteoporosis [^115fvr58].

- **Metabolic effects**: Insulin resistance [^117C2589] and metabolic syndrome [^114S7JBu].

---

## Recommended vitamin D supplementation guidelines

The **Endocrine Society Clinical Practice Guidelines** (ESCPG) [^114Hfpqn] [^115txpG3] provide specific recommendations for vitamin D supplementation in patients with liver disease:

- **Screening**: Serum 25(OH)D levels should be measured [^1123HSa4] in patients with chronic liver disease [^111tPxE5].

- **Deficiency treatment**: 50,000 IU of vitamin D2 or D3 once weekly for 8 weeks, or 6,000 IU daily, to achieve serum 25(OH)D ≥ 30 ng/mL [^114Hfpqn] [^111tPxE5].

- **Maintenance therapy**: 1,500–2,000 IU/day after correction of deficiency [^114Hfpqn] [^111tPxE5].

- **Higher doses**: May be required in patients with severe liver disease or malabsorption [^115rP1Fz] [^111tPxE5].

---

## Evidence from clinical trials

Clinical trials have evaluated the **efficacy and safety** of vitamin D supplementation in patients with liver disease:

- **Cirrhosis trial**: 50,000 IU weekly for 12 weeks significantly increased serum 25(OH)D and improved insulin resistance [^117C2589] without significant adverse effects [^1169fzM4].

- **NAFLD trial**: 1,000 IU/day for 12 months reduced liver steatosis and fibrosis indices [^115Kpd4V].

- **Safety**: Doses up to 10,000 IU/day [^111XtMAu] were generally safe, with mild hypercalcemia in a small proportion of patients [^115hjNBv].

---

## Risks and considerations

Vitamin D supplementation in patients with liver damage requires **careful monitoring** because excessive intake can cause **hypercalcemia** [^111N7h4X], leading to renal and cardiovascular complications. Monitor liver function tests to detect adverse effects, and review potential drug interactions for medications metabolized by the liver.

---

## Monitoring and adjustment

Monitor serum 25(OH)D, calcium, and liver function tests **every 3–6 months**, and adjust supplementation based on serum 25(OH)D levels and clinical response [^112KAZmH].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended vitamin d dose** | **Monitoring** |
|-|-|-|
| Deficiency (< 20 ng/mL) [^1144Ymwq] | 50,000 IU weekly for 8 weeks or 6,000 IU daily [^114Hfpqn] | - Serum 25(OH)D <br/> - Calcium <br/> - Liver function tests |
| Maintenance (≥ 30 ng/mL) [^114Hfpqn] | 1,500–2,000 IU/day [^114Hfpqn] | - Serum 25(OH)D <br/> - Calcium <br/> - Liver function tests |
| Severe liver disease or malabsorption | Higher doses (individualized) [^115rP1Fz] | - Serum 25(OH)D <br/> - Calcium <br/> - Liver function tests |

Vitamin D deficiency is common in patients with liver damage [^117HT7F7], and supplementation is recommended to maintain serum 25(OH)D levels ≥ 30 ng/mL [^114Hfpqn]. The appropriate dose for a 61-year-old male with liver damage is **1,500–2,000 IU/day** [^114Hfpqn], with higher doses required in cases of severe deficiency or malabsorption [^115rP1Fz]. Regular monitoring of serum 25(OH)D, calcium, and liver function tests is essential to ensure safety and efficacy [^1123HSa4].

### Consensus statement on vitamin D status assessment and supplementation: Whys, whens, and hows [^111NsF98]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). High credibility.

Issues surrounding ergocalciferol use are of note for the United States, where 50,000 IU of vitamin D₂ was the only high-dose preparation available by physician prescription, leading to its widespread prescription. Currently, 50,000 IU of vitamin D₃ is available by prescription. In addition to assay issues, the widespread use of intermittent high-dose ergocalciferol ("bolus" therapy) appears to alter vitamin D metabolism, specifically increasing 24-hydroxylase activity. Other adverse consequences of high-dose vitamin D therapy, notably an increased fall risk, are reported and have led to calls for a critical assessment of daily vs. bolus vitamin D therapy.

To summarize, vitamins D₂ and D₃ are not equivalent in raising circulating 25(OH)D. Bolus dosing may adversely affect vitamin D metabolism and clinical outcomes. As such, it is expected that calls for the use of only cholecalciferol and avoidance of ergocalciferol have been and continue to be published, with recent osteoporosis-treatment guidance advising cholecalciferol over ergocalciferol. Despite these recommendations, high-dose ergocalciferol remains widely prescribed in the United States.

Calcifediol is the intermediate metabolite between cholecalciferol and calcitriol. Several pharmacokinetic studies performed over the last four decades have demonstrated its hydrophilic properties, leading to higher solubility in organic solvents, less sequestration in adipose tissue, a smaller distribution volume, and a shorter half-life when compared to cholecalciferol. Consequently, its hydrophilic nature…

### Vitamin D deficiency in patients with liver cirrhosis [^111tPxE5]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

The Endocrine Society Clinical Practice Guideline (ESCPG) recommends screening for vitamin D deficiency (cutoff < 20 ng/mL) in individuals at high risk for deficiency, including those with hepatic failure, and suggests vitamin D supplementation in cases of deficiency. They also assert that vitamin D requirements may be greater for sick patients than for healthy individuals and that serum vitamin D levels above 30 ng/mL may have additional benefits in reducing the risk for various disease conditions. They recommend that all adults who are vitamin D deficient be treated with 50,000 IU of vitamin D2 or vitamin D3 once a week for 8 weeks or its equivalent of 6,000 IU of vitamin D2 or vitamin D3 daily to achieve a serum level of 25(OH)D above 30 ng/mL, followed by maintenance therapy of 1,500–2,000 IU/day. Furthermore, they have set minimal daily dietary recommendations of vitamin D intake for patients at high risk for vitamin D deficiency, depending on their age group. The extent of the recommended screening indications is limited to hepatic failure and does not cover the full spectrum of liver diseases.

International liver study associations, including both the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) and the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD), recommend fat-soluble vitamin substitution for the management of all patients with cholestatic liver diseases. These recommendations focus mostly on the prevention of osteoporosis. More specifically, they propose clinical assessment of the risk of osteoporosis for all cholestatic patients and emphasize the importance of both identifying reversible risk factors and applying appropriate lifestyle changes.

Regarding preventative measures for vitamin D deficiency, specifically concerning vitamin D requirements, the ES 2011 guidelines recommend advising an intake of at least 600 IU/day of vitamin D in adults aged 19–50 years to maximize bone health and muscle function. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether 600 IU/day is enough to provide all the potential nonskeletal health benefits associated with vitamin D. It is recognized that at least 1,500–2,000 IU/day of vitamin D may be required to consistently raise the blood level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D above 30 ng/mL.

Bankuti et al. reported a significant association of 25(OH)D levels with the degree of liver dysfunction. They enrolled 75 patients with liver cirrhosis of various etiologies and severities; approximately 14% of the patients had Child-Pugh C cirrhosis. All patients were followed until hepatic decompensation or death. The levels of 25(OH)D were inversely correlated with both the MELD score and the Child-Pugh score. Patients in the first tertile (6.9 ± 1.9 ng/mL) versus the third/reference tertile (27.1 ± 6.3 ng/mL) of 25(OH)D levels had a relative risk for hepatic decompensation and mortality of 6.37 (95% CI: 1.75–23.2; P = 0.005) and 4.31 (95% CI: 1.38–13.5; P = 0.012), respectively, after adjusting for age and sex.

### Vitamin D supplementation for the treatment of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: A randomized double blind placebo controlled trial [^112FeESA]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2018). Low credibility.

Low serum vitamin D has been associated with metabolic syndrome and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). This study aimed to investigate the impact of vitamin D supplementation in the treatment of patients with NAFLD.

- **Methods**: In a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, patients with NAFLD were randomized to receive one weekly pearl of placebo, 50,000 U vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) pearl per week, and 0.25 mg calcitriol (1,25 dihydroxycholecalciferol) pearl per day for 3 months.

- **Results**: 106 NAFLD patients were randomized to receive calcitriol, vitamin D3, and placebo pearls for 12 weeks, and data for 91 patients were analyzed. After 12 weeks of treatment, serum alkaline phosphatase levels significantly decreased from baseline levels in the vitamin D and calcitriol treated groups (P < 0.05).

- **Conclusion**: While a significant reduction in serum alkaline phosphatase and GGT was seen with vitamin D and calcitriol supplementation from baseline levels, no beneficial effects were observed when comparing vitamin D, calcitriol, and placebo groups at the end of the trial.

### Effects of vitamin D supplementation on the glycaemic indices, lipid profile and liver function tests in patients with cirrhosis: a double-blind randomised controlled trial [^1142BGuD]. BMJ Nutrition, Prevention & Health (2024). High credibility.

Liver cirrhosis is the last stage of chronic liver diseases (CLD) which progresses slowly over years. It can eventually lead to complete liver failure and death. The prevalence of liver cirrhosis and its morbidity and mortality is increasing, making it a major health concern globally. Fatty liver disease (especially alcoholic fatty liver disease) and viral hepatitis (B or C) are the most common causes of cirrhosis. Vitamin D, a fat-soluble vitamin, plays a significant role in health maintenance. It is necessary for calcium homeostasis and also plays a role in regulating the body's immune system. The liver has an important role in vitamin D metabolism, and various research indicates that vitamin D deficiency (VDD) is related to an increased risk of some chronic diseases, such as type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome, and mortality. Several studies show that more than two-thirds of patients with CLD suffer from VDD. A decreased number of hepatocytes and changes in the hydroxylation of vitamin D in the liver are some causes of VDD in patients with cirrhosis. Kubesch et al. reported an association between severe VDD and decompensated cirrhosis. Few studies have been conducted on the effect of vitamin D supplementation in patients with cirrhosis. This study aimed to identify the effects of vitamin D supplementation on serum 25(OH)D3 as well as metabolic indices in patients with cirrhosis.

### Vitamin D deficiency in patients with liver cirrhosis [^111gXbBP]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

There is ongoing evidence that vitamin D is related to the pathophysiology of cirrhosis. Although the incidence of vitamin D deficiency in chronic liver diseases and cirrhosis is strongly documented, its pathogenic association with advanced liver fibrosis remains controversial. There is evidence of a significant relation of 25(OH)D levels with the degree of liver dysfunction, considering that an inverse correlation of 25(OH)D levels with both Child-Pugh score and Model for End-Stage Liver Disease has been reported. In addition, vitamin D deficiency has been shown to increase the risk for overall mortality and infections in patients with cirrhosis. Vitamin D deficiency has been also associated with advanced stages of hepatocellular carcinoma and poor prognosis.

Finally, there are studies suggesting that patients with chronic hepatitis C and normal vitamin D levels have a higher virological response to treatment. However, there are not enough studies conducted in cirrhotic-only populations. The association between vitamin D and cirrhosis demonstrates a great potential for clinical application. The relation between vitamin D deficiency and the degree of liver function, degree of fibrosis, and infectious complications could support its use as a prognostic index and a diagnostic tool.

### Vitamin D deficiency in patients with liver cirrhosis [^115miP6b]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

The deranged metabolism of vitamin D in liver cirrhosis was first reported in the late '70s, and it was mainly attributed to impaired 25(OH)-vitamin D hydroxylation of the precursor vitamin D due to insufficient liver function. Before the year 2000, the majority of the studies on vitamin D in cirrhosis focused on the association of hepatic insufficiency with bone demineralization, osteomalacia, osteoporosis, minerals metabolism/equilibrium (calcium, phosphorus), possible endocrine disturbances (parathormone – secondary hyperparathyroidism), and, in general, with the homeostasis involving the liver-kidney-gut-calcium axis. In the past two decades, there have been considerable advances in the understanding of the pathophysiology of vitamin D and its possible clinical implications in chronic liver diseases.

### Vitamin D deficiency in patients with liver cirrhosis [^113NiLd6]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

The sustained virological response (SVR) in patients with cirrhosis and chronic hepatitis C has been an area of limited research, particularly concerning vitamin D supplementation in antiviral treatment regimens. Most published data focus on patients with chronic hepatitis C treated with interferon-ribavirin. These studies typically involve a small number of cirrhotic patients, usually those with compensated disease (Child-Pugh class A).

- **Vitamin D levels and SVR**: Petta et al. reported that low 25(OH)D levels are an independent risk factor for achieving SVR with interferon-based therapy. In contrast, studies by Terrier et al. and Kitson et al. found no association between baseline 25(OH)D status and SVR in HIV-HCV co-infected and HCV mono-infected cohorts, respectively.

- **Meta-analyses findings**: Two recent meta-analyses have explored this field. The first meta-analysis found a high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency, suggesting a higher likelihood of achieving SVR in individuals with higher serum vitamin D levels or those on vitamin D supplementation. The second meta-analysis identified a significant association with SVR only for a vitamin D cut-off of 20 ng/mL (OR: 0.53, 95% CI: 0.31–0.91). When outliers were excluded, significant pooled odds ratios (ORs) were observed for all patients: 10 ng/mL (OR: 0.48, 95% CI: 0.34–0.67) and 20 ng/mL (OR: 0.58, 95% CI: 0.45–0.76). Specifically, for genotype 1/4 patients, the ORs were 10 ng/mL (OR: 0.53, 95% CI: 0.34–0.81) and 20 ng/mL (OR: 0.54, 95% CI: 0.39–0.74).

### A nontoxic case of vitamin D toxicity [^1122eRzV]. Laboratory Medicine (2015).

Vitamin D toxicity, also known as hypervitaminosis D, was previously believed to be rare. However, with an increase in vitamin D supplementation, several cases have been reported in the literature. Fat-soluble vitamins like vitamin D, due to their ability to accumulate in the body, have a higher potential for toxicity than water-soluble vitamins. The main clinical consequence of vitamin D toxicity is hypercalcemia.

In this report, we describe an adult female patient who developed very high serum vitamin D levels (746 ng/mL, RI: 20 to 50) as a result of a medication error. Despite such high serum concentrations, the patient was without any clinical symptoms and had normal serum calcium levels. We critically discuss the mechanism of toxicity and hypothesize the possible molecular and metabolic factors that might have been responsible for this nontoxic presentation.

This case study highlights the fact that physicians need to consider the risk of medication errors when prescribing vitamin D therapy. Clinical trials to study vitamin D toxicity in humans are not ethically possible. Thus, the evidence base regarding the safety profile of vitamin D supplementation in humans has been built through case reports. This review of the paradoxical clinico-laboratory manifestation of hypervitaminosis D could potentially contribute to the existing literature.

### Vitamin D deficiency in patients with liver cirrhosis [^114rVa4k]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Three studies — two conducted in cirrhotic cohorts and one involving patients with hepatocellular carcinoma — reached similar conclusions. In the first study, the authors examined the association of vitamin D deficiency with survival in a cohort of 92 patients with advanced liver cirrhosis (82% Child-Pugh stages B and C). They reported a significant incidence of vitamin D deficiency (86%). In the univariate analysis, low vitamin D levels were associated with increased mortality; levels ≤ 6 ng/mL were linked with an unfavorable outcome, whereas vitamin D levels < 20 ng/mL were not statistically significant. Multivariate analysis confirmed that both the MELD score and serum vitamin D ≤ 6 ng/mL were independent predictors of mortality. A 25(OH)D level ≤ 6 ng/mL had a positive predictive value of 50% mortality within 24 months. Moreover, mortality from infectious complications was more frequent in this subgroup.

The second study was conducted in a cohort of hospitalized cirrhotics of various etiologies. Approximately 60% of the patients had severe vitamin D deficiency (< 10 ng/mL). The authors found an inverse correlation between 25(OH)D levels and the Child-Pugh score, but no correlation with the MELD score. Infections were more common in patients with severe vitamin D deficiency compared to those without deficiency (54% vs. 29%). Additionally, severe vitamin D deficiency was independently associated with infections, alongside the Child-Pugh score and C-reactive protein levels. In a multivariate Cox regression analysis including Child-Pugh score, infections, and severe vitamin D deficiency, the significance of these findings was underscored.

### Vitamin D toxicity resulting from overzealous correction of vitamin D deficiency [^111N7h4X]. Clinical Endocrinology (2015). Low credibility.

Vitamin D toxicity, often considered rare, can be life-threatening and associated with substantial morbidity if not identified promptly.

- **Objective**: To describe clinical and biochemical features, risk factors, and management of patients with vitamin D toxicity seen between January 2011 and January 2013.

- **Methodology**: Patients presenting with vitamin D toxicity between January 2011 and January 2013 at a single tertiary care center in Delhi-NCR, India, were included. Evaluation included detailed clinical history and biochemical tests, including serum calcium, phosphorus, creatinine, intact parathyroid hormone, and 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D).

- **Results**: Sixteen patients with vitamin D toxicity were identified. Clinical manifestations included nausea, vomiting, altered sensorium, constipation, pancreatitis, acute kidney injury, and weight loss. The median (range) age was 64.5 (42–86) years. The median (range) serum 25(OH)D level and median (range) serum total serum calcium level were 371 (175–1161) ng/ml and 13.0 (11.1–15.7) mg/dl, respectively. Overdose of vitamin D, caused by prescription of mega-doses of vitamin D, was the cause of vitamin D toxicity in all cases. The median (range) cumulative vitamin D dose was 3,600,000 (2,220,000–6,360,000) IU.

- **Conclusion**: Our data demonstrate an emergence of vitamin D toxicity as an increasingly common cause of symptomatic hypercalcemia. Irrational use of vitamin D in mega-doses resulted in vitamin D toxicity in all cases. Awareness among healthcare providers regarding the toxic potential of high doses of vitamin D and cautious use of such supplements is essential.

The treatment regimen was amended after the preliminary results of Phase 1 were collected and assessed. A higher dose and longer duration of vitamin D2 were used in Phase 2. Serum 25-OHD level was measured at baseline. An oral vitamin D2 dose of 200,000 IU/day was administered for 12 days, resulting in a total dose of 2,400,000 IU over the administration period. This total dose was proposed based on the findings from Phase 1. The total dose of 2,400,000 IU was double the dose of 1,200,000 IU, which was used in the second loading in Phase 1.

In addition, vitamin D2 administration was divided into multiple daily doses over several days instead of a single dose, with speculation of better intestinal vitamin D absorption. Serum 25-OHD level was measured 2 weeks after treatment. If the serum 25-OHD level was less than 30 ng/mL, 400,000 IU/day of oral vitamin D2, which was double the amount given in the Phase 2 daily dose, was administered daily for another 8 weeks. Serum 25-OHD level was measured again at weeks 4 and 8.

- **Data analysis**: Descriptive statistics were used in this study. Data were reported as the number (frequency) of patients for each particular result. Continuous variables were presented as median and range.

### Effects of vitamin D supplementation on the glycaemic indices, lipid profile and liver function tests in patients with cirrhosis: A double-blind randomised controlled trial [^117C2589]. BMJ Nutrition, Prevention & Health (2024). High credibility.

Liver cirrhosis is considered a progressive disease that can eventually result in death. Vitamin D deficiency is prevalent in patients with cirrhosis, and few studies have been conducted on the effect of vitamin D supplementation in these patients.

The aim of this study was to identify the effect of vitamin D supplementation on lipid profile, glycaemic indices, and liver function tests in patients with cirrhosis. Sixty patients with cirrhosis were involved in this double-blind, randomised controlled clinical trial. During the intervention, patients received one 50,000 IU pearl of vitamin D supplement or placebo per week for 12 weeks. Before and after supplementation, serum 25-hydroxy-vitamin-D3 (25(OH)D3), glycaemic indices (including insulin, haemoglobin A1c, fasting blood glucose (FBG), and homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR)), lipid profile, and liver function tests were assessed.

Baseline variables were not significantly different between groups. The study indicated that over the 12 weeks, vitamin D supplementation significantly increased serum 25(OH)D3 (p < 0.001), and significantly decreased FBG (p = 0.006) and HOMA-IR (p = 0.001).

Vitamin D supplementation significantly improves FBG and HOMA-IR, as well as serum 25(OH)D3 in patients with cirrhosis.

The protocol of the study was registered at the Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials (IRCT) (IRCT20140502017522N2).

### Relationship of vitamin D status with advanced liver fibrosis and response to hepatitis C virus therapy: a meta-analysis [^111VKqGj]. Hepatology (2014). Low credibility.

There is growing evidence that vitamin D is related to chronic hepatitis C (CHC) pathogenicity. We analyzed the relationship of vitamin D status with advanced liver fibrosis (ALF) in CHC treatment-naïve patients and sustained virologic response (SVR) in CHC patients on pegylated interferon alpha plus ribavirin (pegIFNα/ribavirin) therapy. We performed a meta-analysis of all eligible studies published at the time of writing (April 2014) in PubMed, SCOPUS, LILACS, and the Cochrane Library, assessing plasma/serum vitamin D levels related to ALF and/or SVR. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) were estimated by either fixed or random effects models.

Fourteen studies were selected from the literature search, seven for ALF (1,083 patients) and 11 for SVR (2,672 patients). For liver fibrosis, low vitamin D status was related to a diagnosis of ALF, with the cutoffs of 10 ng/mL (OR = 2.37, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.20–4.72) and 30 ng/mL (OR = 2.22, 95% CI = 1.24–3.97) being significant, and a near-significance for 20 ng/mL (OR = 1.44, 95% CI = 0.99–2.12). Regarding SVR, a significant heterogeneity among studies was found (P < 0.001), and we only found a significant association with SVR for a vitamin D cutoff of 20 ng/mL (OR = 0.53, 95% CI = 0.31–0.91). When meta-analysis was performed excluding the outliers, significant pooled ORs were found for all patients at 10 ng/mL (OR = 0.48, 95% CI = 0.34–0.67) and 20 ng/mL (OR = 0.58, 95% CI = 0.45–0.76) and specifically for GT1/4 patients at 10 ng/mL (OR = 0.53, 95% CI = 0.34–0.81) and 20 ng/mL (OR = 0.54, 95% CI = 0.39–0.74).

### Adverse effects of vitamin D deficiency on outcomes of patients with chronic hepatitis B [^112i6TGN]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2015). Low credibility.

Vitamin D is an immunomodulator that might be involved in the pathogenesis of viral hepatitis. We investigated the effects of vitamin D deficiency on long-term outcomes of patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB).

- **Methods**: We performed a prospective cohort study of 426 patients with CHB (65% male; mean age, 41 ± 13 years), who were enrolled from 1997 through 2000. Serum levels of 25-hydroxycholecalciferol (25(OH)D3) were measured on study enrollment (baseline). Patients were followed for 159 ± 46 months until the last clinic visit or death; approximately 33% received antiviral therapy during the follow-up period. The primary outcome was a clinical event (hepatocellular carcinoma, complications of cirrhosis, or death).

- **Results**: At baseline, the patients' mean serum level of hepatitis B virus DNA was 5.0 ± 2.1 log10 IU/mL; their mean level of 25(OH)D3 was 24.3 ± 9.4 ng/mL, and 348 patients (82%) had vitamin D deficiency (< 32 ng/mL). Serum levels of 25(OH)D3 did not correlate with cirrhosis or viral load. Ninety-seven patients (22.8%) developed clinical events by a mean time of 118 ± 60 months after study enrollment. Patients who developed clinical events had lower baseline serum levels of 25(OH)D3 (23.2 ± 10.4 ng/mL) than patients who did not (28.2 ± 9.3 ng/mL, P < .001). Low baseline serum 25(OH)D3 was an independent factor associated with clinical events after adjustment for sex, age, and cirrhosis. The adjusted hazard ratio of vitamin D deficiency for clinical events was 1.90 (95% confidence interval, 1.06–2.43; p = 0.04).

### Evaluation, treatment, and prevention of vitamin D deficiency: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^116uJcoA]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for vitamin D deficiency and vitamin D requirements, the ES 2011 guidelines recommend advising an intake of at least 600 IU/day of vitamin D for adults aged 50–70 years, and 800 IU/day for those over 70 years. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether 600 and 800 IU/day of vitamin D are enough to provide all of the potential nonskeletal health benefits associated with vitamin D. It is recognized that at least 1,500–2,000 IU/day of supplemental vitamin D may be required to raise the blood level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D to above 30 ng/mL.

### Marked 25-hydroxyvitamin D deficiency is associated with poor prognosis in patients with alcoholic liver disease [^116FwbLW]. Journal of Hepatology (2013). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to investigate the association of vitamin D with clinical, biological, and histological parameters and survival in patients with alcoholic liver disease (ALD). Vitamin D deficiency has been frequently reported in advanced liver disease; however, its influence on ALD has not been well-defined. Furthermore, the study explored the effect of vitamin D treatment on ALD patient peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and in a murine experimental model of ALD.

- **Methods**: Serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] were determined in 324 Caucasian ALD patients and 201 healthy controls. In vitro experiments on vitamin D pre-treated PBMCs evaluated TNFα production by ELISA in culture supernatants. Mice were subjected to an ethanol-fed diet, with some receiving oral supplementation three times per week with 1,25(OH)2D.

- **Results**: Severe deficiency in 25(OH)D (< 10 ng/ml) was significantly associated with higher aspartate aminotransferase levels (p = 1.00 × 10⁻³), increased hepatic venous pressure gradient (p = 5.80 × 10⁻⁶), MELD score (p = 2.50 × 10⁻⁴), and Child-Pugh scores (p = 8.50 × 10⁻⁷). In a multivariable analysis, low 25(OH)D concentration was associated with cirrhosis (OR = 2.13, 95% CI = 1.18–3.84, p = 0.013) and mortality (HR = 4.33, 95% CI = 1.47–12.78, p = 7.94 × 10⁻³) at one year. Additionally, in vitro, 1,25(OH)2D pretreatment decreased TNFα production by stimulated PBMCs of ALD patients (p = 3.00 × 10⁻³), while in vivo, it decreased hepatic TNFα expression in ethanol-fed mice (p = 0.04).

- **Conclusions**: Low 25(OH)D levels are associated with increased liver damage.

### No effects of oral vitamin D supplementation on non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in patients with type 2 diabetes: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^1146E5wT]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Despite some studies demonstrating the association between hypovitaminosis D and NAFLD/NASH and the direct effect of vitamin D in modulating hepatic inflammation, fibrosis, and insulin resistance both in vivo and in vitro, very recently, the existence of an independent relationship between biopsy-proven NASH and circulating low 25(OH)D levels has been confuted by two independent studies performed in subjects with different metabolic phenotypes.

Although the actively treated group almost doubled the mean 25(OH)D levels after just 12-week supplementation, our study did not meet the primary endpoint of showing a reduction of hepatic fat content in NAFLD patients undergoing 24-week high-dose oral cholecalciferol supplementation. Indeed, it is possible to speculate that either the period of exposure to normal-optimal 25(OH)D concentration was not enough for modifying the hepatic fat content and the clinical/biochemical indicators of hepatic involvement in NAFLD, or the link between vitamin D and NAFLD could be appreciated only in specific sub-populations of patients with fatty liver.

As we aimed specifically to assess the efficacy of vitamin D supplementation on liver steatosis in T2D patients, the study population was selected among T2D patients referring to our diabetes outpatients' clinic for routine diabetes care. Likewise, this setting led to the recruitment of subjects with milder NAFLD levels than those detectable in patients purposely referring to hepatology clinics for the treatment of liver diseases.

### Nonlinear associations of serum vitamin D levels with advanced liver disease and mortality: a US cohort study [^115jR82K]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2025). Low credibility.

We categorized the patients with vitamin D deficiency into exposed and non-exposed groups based on their vitamin D status, as determined by serum 25(OH)D levels and vitamin D supplementation. The continuous deficiency group comprised patients with vitamin D deficiency for more than one year, as defined by a serum 25(OH)D level of 20.00–30.00 ng/mL continuously for one year without any record of sufficient levels (i.e. 30.01–80.00 ng/mL). The recovery group consisted of patients with an initial vitamin D deficiency who subsequently achieved vitamin D sufficiency within one year of starting vitamin D supplementation and maintained sufficient levels without reverting to a deficient status. The vitamin D sufficiency group (non-exposed group) comprised patients with serum 25(OH)D levels of 30.01–80.00 ng/mL without records of vitamin D deficiency.

### Vitamin D and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD): Is it more than just an association [^114S7JBu]. Hepatology (2013). Low credibility.

Vitamin D is a secosteroid with known effects on calcium homeostasis. It has recently been shown to have other significant functions regarding immune modulation, cell differentiation and proliferation, and the inflammatory response. As our understanding of the many functions of vitamin D has grown, the presence of vitamin D deficiency (VDD) has become more evident in Western populations.

Concomitantly, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has become the most common cause of chronic liver disease. NAFLD and VDD are often found together. While this is not unexpected, given their similar associations with obesity and sedentary lifestyle, a growing body of evidence points to a closely linked and potentially causative relationship between VDD and NAFLD. The epidemiologic association between VDD and NAFLD, as well as the role of VDD in the pathogenesis of NAFLD, and the available evidence on the clinical utility of vitamin D replacement in NAFLD populations, are discussed.

### Vitamin a toxicity: When one a day doesn't keep the doctor away [^115DgeNY]. Liver Transplantation (2006). Low credibility.

Vitamin A toxicity has been reported to cause severe liver disease and, occasionally, liver failure. Herein, we present the case of a 60-year-old male with symptoms of muscle soreness, alopecia, nail dystrophy, and ascites. He continued to deteriorate with the development of refractory ascites, renal insufficiency, encephalopathy, and failure to thrive. A liver biopsy demonstrated the presence of Ito cells and vacuolated Kupffer cells without the presence of cirrhosis. His clinical history revealed ingestion of large doses of vitamin A. His worsening clinical situation ruled out the possibility of a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt. The patient underwent orthotopic liver transplantation with resolution of symptoms. Vitamin A toxicity should be considered in the differential diagnosis of noncirrhotic portal hypertension. In conclusion, liver transplantation is a valid option if no improvement occurs despite cessation of the medication.

Regarding preventative measures for vitamin D deficiency, more specifically with respect to vitamin D requirements, the Endocrine Society 2011 guidelines recommend advising at least 2–3 times more vitamin D intake for their age group. This is particularly important for adults with obesity or those on anticonvulsant medications, corticosteroids, antifungals such as ketoconazole, and medications for AIDS, to satisfy their body's vitamin D requirement.

### The effect of a single oral megadose of vitamin D provided as either ergocalciferol (D₂) or cholecalciferol (D₃) in alcoholic liver cirrhosis [^112pfiiR]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2012). Low credibility.

The goal of this study was to examine the effects of a single oral dose of 300,000 international units of either ergocalciferol (D₂) or cholecalciferol (D₃) on the plasma levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D in patients with alcoholic liver cirrhosis.

- **Methods**: Inclusion criteria for this study were diagnosis of alcoholic liver cirrhosis and plasma levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D less than 25 nmol/l. At baseline, patients were divided into Child-Pugh groups A, B, or C and were given one oral dose of 300,000 international units of ergocalciferol (D₂ group, N = 23) or cholecalciferol (D₃ group, N = 13). Plasma concentrations of 25(OH) vitamin D and vitamin D-binding protein were measured on days 0, 7, 30, and 90.

- **Results**: On days 7 and 30, patients from the D₃ group had higher vitamin D levels than patients from the D₂ group (P < 0.05). On day 7, vitamin D levels were found to correlate with Child-Pugh scores from patients in the D₃ group. For patients in the D₂ group, there was a positive correlation between vitamin D and vitamin D-binding protein as indicated by the area under the concentration versus time curves (Spearman's ρ = 0.64, P < 0.001).

- **Conclusion**: In patients with alcoholic liver cirrhosis, a single oral megadose of cholecalciferol was more effective than ergocalciferol in the treatment of vitamin D deficiency. Severe liver disease and low levels of vitamin D-binding protein were predictors for poor treatment outcomes.

### Safety of high-dose vitamin D supplementation: Secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial [^115hjNBv]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). High credibility.

More than 3% of adults report vitamin D intakes of 4000 IU/day or more, but the safety of this practice is unknown. The objective of this work is to establish whether vitamin D doses up to 10,000 IU/day are safe and well tolerated.

The Calgary Vitamin D Study was a 3-year, double-blind, randomized controlled trial. A single-center study was conducted at the University of Calgary, Canada, among healthy adults (n = 373) aged 55 to 70 years with serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels between 30 to 125 nmol/L. Participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive vitamin D3 at doses of 400, 4000, or 10,000 IU/day. Calcium supplementation was initiated if dietary calcium intake was less than 1200 mg/day.

In these prespecified secondary analyses, changes in serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D, calcium, creatinine, 24-hour urine calcium excretion, and incidence of adverse events were assessed. Between-group differences in adverse events were examined using incident rate differences and logistic regression.

Of the 373 participants (400 IU: 124, 4000 IU: 125, 10,000 IU: 124), 49% were male, with a mean (SD) age of 64 (4) years, and a mean 25-hydroxyvitamin D level of 78.0 (19.5) nmol/L. Serum calcium, creatinine, and 24-hour urine calcium excretion did not differ between treatments. Mild hypercalcemia (2.56–2.64 mmol/L) occurred in 15 (4%) participants (400 IU: 0%, 4000 IU: 3%, 10,000 IU: 9%; p = 0.002); all cases resolved on repeat testing. Hypercalciuria occurred in 87 (23%) participants (400 IU: 17%, 4000 IU: 22%, 10,000 IU: 31%; p = 0.01).

### Vitamin D supplementation for chronic liver diseases in adults [^115JswHe]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). High credibility.

Vitamin D deficiency is often reported in people with chronic liver diseases. Therefore, improving vitamin D status could have a beneficial effect on people with chronic liver diseases.

- **Objectives**: To assess the beneficial and harmful effects of vitamin D supplementation in people with chronic liver diseases.

- **Search methods**: We searched The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, Science Citation Index Expanded, and Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science. We also searched databases of ongoing trials and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. Bibliographies of relevant publications were scanned, and experts and pharmaceutical companies were consulted for additional trials. All searches were up to January 2017.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised clinical trials that compared vitamin D at any dose, duration, and route of administration versus placebo or no intervention in adults with chronic liver diseases were considered. Vitamin D could have been administered as supplemental vitamin D — vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) or vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol) — or an active form of vitamin D such as 1α-hydroxyvitamin D (alfacalcidol), 25-hydroxyvitamin D (calcidiol), or 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (calcitriol).

- **Data collection and analysis**: We used standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration. We contacted authors of the trials to request missing information. Random-effects and fixed-effect meta-analyses were conducted.

### Calcitriol [^1165vUWT]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

In the treatment of hypoparathyroidism, the recommended initial dosage of calcitriol is 0.25 mcg/day, administered in the morning. If a satisfactory response in biochemical parameters and clinical manifestations of the disease is not observed, the dosage may be increased at 2- to 4-week intervals. During the dosage titration period, serum calcium levels should be obtained at least twice weekly. If hypercalcemia is noted, calcitriol should be immediately discontinued until normocalcemia ensues (see PRECAUTIONS: General). Careful consideration should also be given to lowering the dietary calcium intake. Serum calcium, phosphorus, and 24-hour urinary calcium should be determined periodically.

Most adult patients and pediatric patients aged 6 years and older have responded to dosages in the range of 0.5 mcg to 2 mcg daily. Pediatric patients aged 1 to 5 years with hypoparathyroidism have usually been given 0.25 mcg to 0.75 mcg daily. The number of treated patients with pseudohypoparathyroidism less than 6 years of age is too small to make dosage recommendations. Malabsorption is occasionally noted in patients with hypoparathyroidism; hence, larger doses of calcitriol may be needed.

For predialysis patients, the recommended initial dosage of calcitriol is 0.25 mcg/day for adults and pediatric patients aged 3 years and older. This dosage may be increased if necessary to 0.5 mcg/day. For pediatric patients less than 3 years of age, the recommended initial dosage of calcitriol is 10 to 15 ng/kg/day.

### Skeletal and extraskeletal actions of vitamin D: Current evidence and outstanding questions [^111D5Mpk]. Endocrine Reviews (2019). Low credibility.

Liver, lung, and kidney diseases

Although the liver has a very low or undetectable level of vitamin D receptor (VDR) expression, hepatic stellate cells are a clear target, as selective VDR deletion causes hepatic fibrosis and a state of nonalcoholic liver disease.

The lung is another possible target tissue for vitamin D action. Observational and intervention studies have clearly demonstrated a possible link between poor vitamin D status and chronic obstructive lung disease [as reviewed in Ref.]. Finally, vitamin D status has also been linked to a variety of other diseases such as nonalcoholic fatty liver syndrome, some eye diseases, autism, and many other diseases, as reviewed elsewhere.

The kidney is a major partner in vitamin D homeostasis, and renal diseases are frequently associated with lower serum 25OHD and lower 1,25(OH)2D concentrations. The complicated role of vitamin D in this context is beyond the scope of the present review. One meta-review, however, strangely concluded that a lower predicted serum 25OHD was associated with a modestly but significantly higher estimated glomerular filtration rate.

Regarding specific circumstances for vitamins, minerals, and dietary supplements, particularly with respect to patients with herbal and dietary supplement-induced liver injury, AASLD 2022 guidelines emphasize the importance of recognizing that genetic polymorphisms in the HLA region and the conditions under which a product is consumed may influence the likelihood of developing herbal or dietary supplement-induced hepatotoxicity. Notably, HLA-B35:01 has been associated with hepatotoxicity attributed to green tea extract in White populations and Polygonatum multiflorum hepatotoxicity in Asian populations.

### Vitamin D deficiency in patients with liver cirrhosis [^1115kfDa]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

The clinical implications of vitamin D in the cirrhotic setting are significant. Several clinical applications of 25(OH)D levels have been suggested, including its use as a non-invasive marker of liver fibrosis in chronic hepatitis C, as a prognostic factor for mortality and infections in patients with liver cirrhosis, and as a marker of unfavorable outcomes and advanced disease stage in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. Malham et al. emphasized the importance of monitoring vitamin D in all cirrhotic populations, especially those with alcoholic liver cirrhosis. They highlighted the efficacy of treatment in liver insufficiency-associated bone disease, potential extraskeletal benefits (such as improved muscle function, reduced cancer risk, and better immune function), and the probable benefit of higher than standard doses of vitamin D supplementation for repletion. Garcia-Alvarez et al. also recommended vitamin D screening in HCV patients.

Finkelmeier et al. showed that, in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and vitamin D supplementation, the mean serum 25(OH)D levels did not differ significantly from those who did not receive supplementation; however, due to the small number of treated patients, these results should be interpreted with caution.

The possible benefit of vitamin D substitution as a preventive measure for the development of liver fibrosis in patients with chronic hepatitis C has also been suggested. The same authors comment on expanding the indications for vitamin D supplementation to all patients with chronic liver diseases, irrespective of the presence of bone disease.

Vitamin D metabolism and mechanism of action

- **Metabolism**: Vitamin D3 is produced in the skin from 7-dehydrocholesterol (7-DHC), while both vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol) and vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) can be present in the diet. Vitamin D2 and D3 are hydroxylated first in the liver (and other tissues) to 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) and then in the kidney (and other tissues) to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)2D). Both 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)2D are subsequently metabolized to their 24 (and for D3 23) hydroxy forms: 24,25(OH)2D2/3, 23,25(OH)2D3, and 1,24,25(OH)3D2/3 (or 1,23,25(OH)3D3). Like other steroid hormones, vitamin D is highly lipophilic and bound to protein carriers that help maintain stable serum levels. The half-life of serum 25(OH)D is 2 to 3 weeks, and that of the more water-soluble 1,25(OH)2D is approximately 5 to 8 hours. The majority of circulating 25(OH)D, including its metabolites, are bound tightly by vitamin D binding protein (DBP) and more loosely bound by albumin.

### Vitamin D deficiency in patients with liver cirrhosis [^117HT7F7]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Vitamin D deficiency in cirrhosis is related to liver dysfunction rather than etiology, and it is no longer considered prevalent only in cholestatic disorders. Malham et al. compared vitamin D status between patients with alcoholic cirrhosis (ALC) and primary biliary cholangitis (PBC). ALC patients had lower vitamin D levels compared to PBC patients.

A number of studies have supported the prevalence of hypovitaminosis D in chronic liver disease and cirrhosis. One study reported a low prevalence of 25(OH)D deficiency in a cohort of patients with genotype 1 chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and compensated liver disease (15% cirrhotic patients): 48% and 16% of the cohort had vitamin D levels of < 75 nmol/L and < 50 nmol/L, respectively.

### Acute liver damage and subsequent hypophosphatemia in malnourished patients: Case reports and review of literature [^116b9uuL]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2008). Low credibility.

The objective of this study is to discuss the relationship between liver damage and subsequent hypophosphatemia in malnourished patients.

- **Method**: The authors report two cases of malnourished females who developed severe liver damage followed by hypophosphatemia. The liver damage commenced suddenly after more than a week of hospitalization and deteriorated rapidly. Although the precise pathology of the liver damage could not be determined, and the specific cause was not identified, steatohepatitis associated with fatty liver might be considered.

- **Results**: Hypophosphatemia following liver damage was considered to be the result of hepatocyte regeneration. Replacement of phosphorus was found to be an effective treatment.

- **Conclusion**: In these cases, hypophosphatemia suggested an improvement from liver damage. However, it is commonly known that hypophosphatemia plays a central role in refeeding syndrome in malnourished patients. Therefore, it was concluded that attention should be paid to hypophosphatemia after liver damage.

### Effects of vitamin D supplementation on the glycaemic indices, lipid profile and liver function tests in patients with cirrhosis: a double-blind randomised controlled trial [^1169fzM4]. BMJ Nutrition, Prevention & Health (2024). High credibility.

Liver cirrhosis is considered a progressive disease that can eventually result in death, and vitamin D deficiency is prevalent in patients with cirrhosis. Few studies have been conducted on the effect of vitamin D supplementation in this group. This study aimed to identify the effect of vitamin D supplementation on lipid profile, glycaemic indices, and liver function tests in patients with cirrhosis.

Sixty patients with cirrhosis participated in this double-blind, randomised controlled clinical trial. Patients received one 50,000 IU pearl of vitamin D supplement or placebo per week for 12 weeks. Before and after supplementation, serum 25-hydroxy-vitamin-D3 (25(OH)D3), glycaemic indices (including insulin, haemoglobin A1c, fasting blood glucose (FBG), and homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR)), lipid profile, and liver function tests were assessed.

Baseline variables were not significantly different between groups. The study indicated that over the 12 weeks, vitamin D supplementation significantly increased serum 25(OH)D3 (p < 0.001) and significantly decreased FBG (p = 0.006) and HOMA-IR (p = 0.001). In conclusion, vitamin D supplementation significantly improves FBG, HOMA-IR, and serum 25(OH)D3 in patients with cirrhosis.

The protocol of the study was registered at the Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials (IRCT) (IRCT20140502017522N2).

### Vitamin D deficiency in patients with liver cirrhosis [^114jEzXa]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

There is ongoing evidence that vitamin D is related to the pathophysiology of cirrhosis. Although the incidence of vitamin D deficiency in chronic liver diseases and cirrhosis is strongly documented, its pathogenic association with advanced liver fibrosis remains controversial. There is evidence of a significant relationship between 25(OH)D levels and the degree of liver dysfunction, considering that an inverse correlation of 25(OH)D levels with both the Child-Pugh score and Model for End-Stage Liver Disease has been reported. In addition, vitamin D deficiency has been shown to increase the risk for overall mortality and infections in patients with cirrhosis. Vitamin D deficiency has also been associated with advanced stages of hepatocellular carcinoma and poor prognosis.

Studies suggest that patients with chronic hepatitis C and normal vitamin D levels have a higher virological response to treatment. However, there are not enough studies conducted in cirrhotic-only populations. The association between vitamin D and cirrhosis demonstrates significant potential for clinical application. The relationship between vitamin D deficiency and the degree of liver function, the degree of fibrosis, and infectious complications could support its use as a prognostic index and a diagnostic tool.

### Vitamin d deficiency in patients with liver cirrhosis [^112NYuEb]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Vitamin D insufficiency and deficiency are considered common in the general population and are more frequent among elderly people and individuals with chronic diseases. It has been reported that 1 billion people have inadequate serum levels of 25(OH)D. However, the normal range of vitamin D levels has been debated. In general, optimal vitamin D status ranges from 30 to 50 ng/mL (i.e. 75–125 nmol/L).

Vitamin D deficiency is defined as serum 25(OH)D levels lower than 20 ng/mL (i.e. 50 nmol/L), and vitamin D insufficiency is defined as serum levels between 20 and 30 ng/mL (i.e. 50–75 nmol/L). According to the Institute of Medicine (IOM) of the National Academies in the United States, a vitamin D concentration of 20 ng/mL is adequate. However, the Endocrine Society (Maryland, USA) recommends levels of at least 30 ng/mL (i.e. 75 nmol/L) as adequate and concentrations between 40 and 60 ng/mL (i.e. 100–150 nmol/L) as optimal. There is still no definition regarding the optimal vitamin D levels for patients with chronic liver diseases.

### Vitamin D deficiency in patients with liver cirrhosis [^1145shfa]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

However, two studies, similar to the study by Kitson et al, challenged the results of the earlier studies regarding the relation of vitamin D with the stage of liver fibrosis. The authors found no association between the baseline 25(OH)D levels and either the SVR rate or the fibrosis stage. They reported that season, race, and geographic latitude were independent predictors of 25(OH)D status. Mean 25(OH)D levels did not significantly vary between fibrosis stages (F0-F4). This discrepancy, compared to other studies, might be partly related to the lack of certain clinical and laboratory baseline factors (namely, the season of baseline blood sampling) and to the use of non-standardized commercially available automated assays to measure 25(OH)D levels. Figure 1 summarizes the main environmental and genetic factors that implicate vitamin D in the inflammatory and fibrogenetic process.

### Effect of vitamin D supplementation on vitamin D level and bone mineral density in patients with cirrhosis: A randomized clinical trial [^111jWCqP]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

In patients with cirrhosis, highly prevalent vitamin D deficiency and low bone mineral density (BMD) increase the burden of disease, and the role of vitamin D supplementation is not clear. Thus, our aim was to determine the effect of vitamin D supplementation on vitamin D level and BMD in patients with cirrhosis.

- **Methods**: Patients with cirrhosis (18–60 years) of any etiology were enrolled. We measured serum 25(OH)D, parathyroid hormone, thyroid-stimulating hormone, free T4, bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1, and health-related quality of life at entry and at 1 year. Serum calcium was measured at 3-month intervals. BMD was measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry at both the lumbar spine and left hip neck at entry and after 1 year. Statistical analysis was performed according to intention-to-treat analysis.

- **Results**: Of 390 screened patients with cirrhosis, 164 participants (82 in each group) were randomized. There was a significant increase in 25(OH)D levels in the intervention group after 1 year (33.7 [24.3–45.7] ng/mL vs. 23.1 [17–28.2] ng/mL; P < 0.001) compared to placebo. The mean difference in BMD at the lumbar spine and left hip neck was not significantly changed after 1 year of intervention with vitamin D between both groups. There was no significant change in both groups in levels of calcium, thyroid-stimulating hormone, parathyroid hormone, free T4, IGF-1, and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, and quality of life.

- **Discussion**: Supplementation with vitamin D for 1 year improved vitamin D levels but did not result in

### Calcitriol [^112Nbuvs]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Overdosage of calcitriol can lead to hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, and hyperphosphatemia. Since calcitriol is a derivative of vitamin D, the signs and symptoms of overdose are similar to those of vitamin D overdose. High intake of calcium and phosphate alongside calcitriol may result in similar issues. The serum calcium times phosphate (Ca × P) product should not exceed 70 mg²/dL². Elevated calcium levels in the dialysate bath can also contribute to hypercalcemia.

- **Treatment of hypercalcemia and overdosage in dialysis patients and hypoparathyroidism patients**:

	- General treatment for hypercalcemia (greater than 1 mg/dL above the upper limit of normal range) requires immediate cessation of calcitriol therapy, adoption of a low-calcium diet, and withdrawal of calcium supplements. Serum calcium levels should be monitored daily until normocalcemia is achieved. Hypercalcemia typically resolves in 2 to 7 days. Once serum calcium levels return to normal, calcitriol therapy can resume at a dose 0.25 mcg/day less than the previous dose. Serum calcium levels should be checked at least twice weekly following any dosage changes and during subsequent dosage titration. For dialysis patients, persistent or markedly high serum calcium levels can be addressed through dialysis using a calcium-free dialysate.

### Determination of optimal vitamin D dosage in children with cholestasis [^113tCSKK]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Patients with cholestasis have impaired intestinal vitamin D absorption and thus have difficulty achieving optimal serum 25-OHD levels. In this study, we demonstrated that higher doses and longer duration of vitamin D treatment, compared with the general recommendation, can partially improve the increment of serum 25-OHD levels in pediatric patients with cholestasis. Patients with uncorrectable anatomical obstruction of the bile duct had the most difficulty achieving the optimal desired serum 25-OHD level.

- **Phase 1 results**: Infants with biliary atresia who had never undergone or had a failed Kasai operation had poor responses to oral single-day loading of 300,000 IU of vitamin D2 and a higher loading dose of 1,200,000 IU. The findings suggest poor intestinal vitamin D absorption, which is likely caused by a deficiency of intestinal bile acid in these patients due to severe anatomical obstruction of the bile duct. Single-day loading might also contribute to poorer absorption than divided multiple daily doses given over several days.

### ACG clinical guideline: Malnutrition and nutritional recommendations in liver disease [^117TSnbQ]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for liver cirrhosis, more specifically with respect to nutrition, vitamins, and micronutrients, ACG 2025 guidelines recommend considering offering vitamin D supplementation to patients with chronic liver disease if vitamin D levels are low, as it may provide bone-related and liver-related health benefits.

### Risk assessment for vitamin D [^111XtMAu]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2007). Low credibility.

The objective of this review was to apply the risk assessment methodology used by the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) to derive a revised safe Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) for vitamin D. New data continue to emerge regarding the health benefits of vitamin D beyond its role in bone health. The intakes associated with those benefits suggest a need for levels of supplementation, food fortification, or both that are higher than current levels. A prevailing concern exists, however, regarding the potential for toxicity related to excessive vitamin D intakes.

The UL established by the FNB for vitamin D (50 microg, or 2000 IU) is not based on evidence and is viewed by many as being too restrictive, thus curtailing research, commercial development, and optimization of nutritional policy. Human clinical trial data published subsequent to the establishment of the FNB vitamin D UL in 1997 support a significantly higher UL. We present a risk assessment based on relevant, well-designed human clinical trials of vitamin D. Collectively, the absence of toxicity in trials conducted in healthy adults that used vitamin D doses ≥ 250 microg/d (10,000 IU vitamin D3) supports the confident selection of this value as the UL.

### Vitamin D toxicity: A 16-year retrospective study at an academic medical center [^111PQS1T]. Laboratory Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Interest in vitamin D has increased during the past two decades, with a corresponding increase in laboratory testing of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D]. The vast majority of specimens tested display normal or deficient levels of 25(OH)D; concentrations rarely fall in the potentially toxic range.

- **Methods**: We performed a retrospective investigation of elevated 25(OH)D levels during a 16-year period at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics (UIHC), a 734-bed tertiary-/quaternary-care academic medical center in the Midwestern United States. Detailed medical-record reviews were conducted for patients with serum/plasma 25(OH)D concentrations higher than 120 ng per mL.

- **Results**: A total of 127,932 serum/plasma 25(OH)D measurements were performed on 73,779 unique patients. Of these patients, 780 (1.05%) had results that exceeded 80 ng per mL and 89 patients (0.12%) had results that exceeded 120 ng per mL. Only four patients showed symptoms of vitamin D toxicity. Three of these cases involved inadvertent misdosing of liquid formulations.

- **Conclusions**: Symptomatic vitamin D toxicity is uncommon, and elevated levels of 25(OH)D do not strongly correlate with clinical symptoms or total serum/plasma calcium levels. Our study highlights the potential risks of the liquid formulation of vitamin D.

### Vitamin D status of human immunodeficiency virus-positive patients with advanced liver disease enrolled in the solid organ transplantation in HIV: multi-site study [^111n36ov]. Liver Transplantation (2014). Low credibility.

An optimal vitamin D status may benefit liver transplantation (LT) patients. Higher levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] mitigate steroid-induced bone loss after LT, correlate with better hepatitis C virus treatment responses, and increase graft survival. This study investigated 25(OH)D levels and assessed strategies for vitamin D deficiency prevention in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients with advanced liver disease who were enrolled in the Solid Organ Transplantation in HIV: Multi-Site Study.

25(OH)D was measured in banked specimens from 154 LT candidates/recipients with the DiaSorin assay; deficiency was defined as a 25(OH)D level < 20 ng/mL. Information about vitamin D supplement use after LT was obtained from medication logs and surveys. Logistic regression, Cox regression, and linear repeated measures analyses were performed with SAS software. It was found that none of the 17 academic medical centers in the United States routinely recommended vitamin D supplements before LT, and only a minority (4/17) recommended them to all patients after LT. Seventy-one percent of the 139 patients with pre-LT values had vitamin D deficiency, significantly associated with cirrhosis (P = 0.01) but not other variables. The vitamin D status improved modestly after LT; however, the status remained deficient for 40% of the patients 1 year after LT.

In a multivariate linear repeated measures model, a higher pre-LT 25(OH)D level (P < 0.001), specimen collection in the summer (P < 0.001), and a routine vitamin D supplementation strategy after LT (P < 0.001) were associated with improved vitamin D status.

### Determination of optimal vitamin D dosage in children with cholestasis [^113Kqd2b]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Serum 25-OHD level was measured at baseline. A single oral dose of vitamin D2 was administered — 300,000 IU for patients weighing less than 20 kg, and 600,000 IU for those weighing 20 kg or more. Serum 25-OHD level was measured again one week later. If the level was below 30 ng/mL, indicating severely impaired intestinal vitamin D absorption, an additional dose of vitamin D2 was administered within four days — 1,200,000 IU for patients weighing less than 20 kg, and 2,400,000 IU for those weighing 20 kg or more. One week after the additional dose, serum 25-OHD level was measured, and the difference between week 1 and baseline levels (Δ25-OHD first) was calculated.

Patients received daily oral vitamin D2 as continuation treatment from the second week for four weeks. The daily dose of vitamin D2 was calculated using the formula: [(expected Δ25-OHD in children without cholestasis given the same high vitamin D dose)/(the patient's actual Δ25-OHD first)] × estimated daily dose for children without cholestasis. Serum 25-OHD level was measured again at the end of the continuation treatment.

The expected Δ25-OHD in children without cholestasis and the estimated daily dose for children without cholestasis were based on previously reported values and adjusted to approximate the following numbers: 50 ng/mL and 2,000 IU/day for patients weighing less than 10 kg; 40 ng/mL and 2,000 IU/day for patients weighing 10–19.9 kg; 50 ng/mL and 4,000 IU/day for patients weighing 20 kg or more.

### No effects of oral vitamin D supplementation on non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in patients with type 2 diabetes: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^114Rpn7D]. BMC Medicine (2016). High credibility.

This is the first randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of high-dose vitamin D oral supplementation performed in T2D patients with NAFLD. This trial showed that a nutraceutical intervention based on high-dose vitamin D oral supplementation has no effect on hepatic fat content in T2D patients affected by NAFLD. The 24-week cholecalciferol supplementation did not improve transaminases levels or the serum levels of biomarkers specific for hepatic injury and fibrogenesis such as CK18-M30 and P3NP. Similarly, clinical surrogates of liver impairment in the course of NAFLD, such as AST/ALT ratio and FLI, did not show significant changes after vitamin D supplementation.

As we specifically aimed to study the effect of vitamin D on fatty liver in diabetic patients, we also tested the hypothesis of an involvement of vitamin D in modulating insulin resistance, metabolic profile, and glycemic control in these subjects. However, none of these parameters significantly changed after 24 weeks of vitamin D treatment compared to the placebo group. Likewise, vitamin D supplementation did not induce any specific effect on endothelial function and subclinical atherosclerosis.

Furthermore, as not all the study participants displayed low circulating 25(OH)D levels at the baseline, we postulated that vitamin D supplementation could exert favorable effects on NAFLD only in patients affected by hypovitaminosis D. However, the ancillary analyses did not confirm this hypothesis, as we observed a similar response in patients with normal or reduced 25(OH)D at the baseline.

### Inappropriate vitamin D supplementation among multimorbid older patients: a multicountry analysis [^115zC8tk]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Low credibility.

Among individuals flagged for potential vitamin D overuse in the present cohort, more than half (52%) were taking the standard preventive dose of 800 IU/day. Only a small number received very high doses, including two individuals on 300,000 and 600,000 IU/week, respectively, and two others on 7,500 and 25,000 IU/day. No adverse effects were reported among those exceeding the recommended doses. However, evidence warns against intermittent high-dose regimens, such as monthly boluses, which have been linked to increased fall risk, particularly in older adults. Specifically, two large RCTs — the VIDA trial (100,000 IU/month) and D-Health trial (60,000 IU/month) — showed no musculoskeletal benefit and raised safety concerns. Extremely high doses like 300,000–600,000 IU/week are not supported in clinical guidelines and pose a risk of toxicity.

The strengths of this study include the multicenter approach, involving four large European centers, which increases the representativeness and generalization of the results. The inclusion of 2008 multimorbid patients provides valuable insights into an often overlooked population. The assessment of medication adherence using the Medication Adherence Questionnaire (©MMAS-8) adds an important dimension, helping to rule out non-adherence as a potential cause for vitamin D underuse. Further strengths include the accurate documentation of medications using ATC codes, including over-the-counter (OTC) medications, and the accurate description of comorbidities using ICD-10 codes.

Regarding the medical management for vitamin D deficiency, specifically concerning vitamin D supplementation, the ES 2011 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of a higher dose, 2–3 times higher, at least 6,000–10,000 IU/day of vitamin D. This should be followed by maintenance therapy of 3,000–6,000 IU/day in patients with obesity, malabsorption syndromes, or those on medications affecting vitamin D metabolism, to treat vitamin D deficiency and maintain a 25-hydroxyvitamin D level > 30 ng/mL.

### Vitamin D replacement for cirrhosis-related bone disease [^115fvr58]. Nature Clinical Practice. Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2006). Low credibility.

The osteoporotic fracture rate in patients with chronic liver disease is approximately twice that of age-matched control individuals. About 66% of patients with moderately severe cirrhosis and 96% of patients awaiting liver transplantation have vitamin D deficiency. Studies have shown a strong correlation between vitamin D deficiency and bone density, particularly in the hip.

Previous studies of vitamin D therapy in cirrhosis-related bone disease have had major design flaws. Most reports and guidelines on the treatment of hepatic bone disease have concluded that vitamin D deficiency does not have a significant pathogenetic role in the development of osteoporosis in cirrhosis and that there is no evidence for a therapeutic effect of vitamin D supplementation. Conversely, it is generally recommended that patients with cirrhosis and low bone density should receive calcium and vitamin D supplementation; yet there is a paucity of reliable data on the optimal doses to use, as well as a lack of clearly demonstrated benefit. We believe that clinical trials of vitamin D therapy in these patients with liver disease are warranted.

As low-dose oral supplementation often will not normalize vitamin D levels or suppress parathyroid hormone activity in cirrhotic patients, high-dose parenteral vitamin D might be preferable. However, further long-term studies are required to assess the benefits and safety of this approach.

### Avoidance of vitamin D deficiency to slow the COVID-19 pandemic [^111HyF5g]. BMJ Nutrition, Prevention & Health (2020). Low credibility.

A very important first step would be to ensure that all people get at least as much vitamin D with a dietary supplement as recommended for the various countries. The recommended daily amount is 400 IU in the UK. US recommendations are 600 IU for adults up to 70 years of age and 800 IU for people over the age of 70. Individuals with known risk factors need more, but recommendations are silent on their specific needs. Higher intakes are likely safe as long as the amounts are well under 4000 IU per day.

### Nonlinear associations of serum vitamin D levels with advanced liver disease and mortality: A US cohort study [^113XM9PV]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2025). Low credibility.

We conducted a separate analysis focusing on patients with any history of vitamin D deficiency without the requirement of a 1-year follow-up. The results were consistent with the main findings, revealing similar risks of liver cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and all-cause mortality as observed in the continuous vitamin D deficiency group. This differentiation highlights the influence of both short-term and prolonged vitamin D deficiencies on the risk of adverse outcomes.

To evaluate the impact of different confounding factors, we performed multiple analyses with varying levels of adjustment. Starting from the crude model and progressively adding demographic factors, socioeconomic status, lifestyle factors, medications, and comorbidities, the associations remained robust across all models, though the magnitude of the associations varied slightly. The final fully adjusted model (Model 6) demonstrated consistent results with our main findings.

To ensure the robustness of the associations, appropriate adjustments were made to address the violation of the proportional hazard assumption in the Cox regression model. In addition, we examined the effects of different follow-up durations. The association of vitamin D deficiency with liver cirrhosis, HCC, and all-cause mortality remained significant across both short-term (3 years) and long-term (15 years) follow-up, with only minor variations in hazard ratios (HRs) noted.

To account for the potential competing risks of death, we performed a competing risk analysis. These results were consistent with our primary findings, highlighting the significance of vitamin D deficiency as an influential factor in adverse health outcomes.

### Calcitriol [^112Fktmf]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Excessive dosage of calcitriol injection induces hypercalcemia and, in some instances, hypercalciuria; therefore, early in treatment during dosage adjustment, serum calcium and phosphorus should be determined at least twice weekly. Should hypercalcemia develop, the drug should be discontinued immediately. Calcitriol injection should be given cautiously to patients on digitalis, because hypercalcemia in such patients may precipitate cardiac arrhythmias.

Patients and their parents should be informed about adherence to instructions regarding diet, calcium supplementation, and the avoidance of unapproved non-prescription drugs, including magnesium-containing antacids. Patients should also be carefully informed about the symptoms of hypercalcemia [see ADVERSE REACTIONS].

Essential laboratory tests include serum calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, and alkaline phosphatase, as well as 24-hour urinary calcium and phosphorus, which should be determined periodically. During the initial phase of the medication, serum calcium and phosphorus should be determined more frequently (twice weekly).

Adynamic bone disease may develop if PTH levels are suppressed to abnormal levels. If a biopsy is not being performed for other diagnostic reasons, PTH levels may indicate the rate of bone turnover. If PTH levels fall below the recommended target range (1.5 to 3 times the upper limit of normal) in patients treated with calcitriol injection, the calcitriol injection dose should be reduced, or therapy discontinued.

### Consensus statement on vitamin D status assessment and supplementation: Whys, whens, and hows [^114jjzc7]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). Low credibility.

In conclusion, VDT is a rare but life-threatening event mostly caused by unintentional overdosing due to pharmaceutical products. The prescriber and dispenser should avoid unlicensed vitamin D products. VDT should always be considered a differential diagnosis when evaluating patients with hypercalcemia. Future studies should encompass the evaluation of conditions that increase the risk of VDT and include the evaluation of classic and nonclassic adverse events for VDT.

### Pharmacokinetics of vitamin D toxicity [^113esbjM]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2008). Low credibility.

Although researchers first identified the fat-soluble vitamin cholecalciferol almost a century ago, and studies have now largely elucidated the transcriptional mechanism of action of its hormonal form, 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) [1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3)], we know surprisingly little about mechanisms of vitamin D toxicity. The lipophilic nature of vitamin D explains its adipose tissue distribution and its slow turnover in the body (half-life approximately 2 months). Its main transported metabolite, 25-hydroxyvitamin D(3) [25(OH)D(3)], shows a half-life of approximately 15 days and circulates at a concentration of 25–200 nmol/L, whereas the hormone 1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3) has a half-life of approximately 15 hours.

Animal experiments involving vitamin D(3) intoxication have established that 25(OH)D(3) can reach concentrations up to 2.5 µmol/L, at which it is accompanied by hypercalcemia and other pathological sequelae resulting from a high calcium/phosphate (Ca/PO(4)) product. The rise in 25(OH)D(3) is accompanied by elevations of its precursor, vitamin D(3), as well as by rises in many of its dihydroxy-metabolites [24,25(OH)(2)D(3); 25,26(OH)(2)D(3); and 25(OH)D(3)-26,23-lactone] but not 1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3).

Early assumptions that 1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3) might cause hypercalcemia in vitamin D toxicity have been replaced by theories that 25(OH)D(3) at pharmacologic concentrations can overcome vitamin D receptor affinity disadvantages to directly stimulate transcription or that total vitamin D metabolite concentrations displace 1alpha,25(OH)(2)D from vitamin D binding, increasing its free concentration.

	- **Vitamin D resistant rickets**: 12,000 to 500,000 IU units daily.

	- **Hypoparathyroidism**: 50,000 to 200,000 IU units daily, concomitantly with calcium lactate 4 g, six times per day. Dosage must be individualized under close medical supervision.

Calcium intake should be adequate. Blood calcium and phosphorus determinations must be made every two weeks or more frequently if necessary. X-rays of the bones should be taken every month until the condition is corrected and stabilized.

### Consensus statement on vitamin D status assessment and supplementation: Whys, whens, and hows [^112KAZmH]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). High credibility.

In conclusion, calcitriol is not suitable for supplementation or nutritional fortification, and none of the many excellent reviews, guidelines, or policy papers consider the use of calcitriol in the nutritional context (supplementation and fortification). However, guidelines suggest that vitamin D supplementation is advised in patients with chronic hypoparathyroidism, chronic kidney failure, and low vitamin D status, in addition to receiving therapeutic doses of calcitriol. Such a recommendation is motivated by the activity of extrarenal 1-α-hydroxylase, which is compromised by reduced renal function (i.e. not regulated by PTH) and is not regulated by feedback mechanisms.

- **Vitamin D safety and monitoring**: Vitamin D supplementation is generally a safe treatment with minimal adverse events and no need for strict monitoring. However, side effects of vitamin D treatment exist and can result in vitamin D toxicity (VDT).

- **Vitamin D toxicity**: VDT is a clinical condition characterized by excess vitamin D (hypervitaminosis D), resulting in severe hypercalcemia that may persist for a prolonged period, leading to serious health consequences. Signs and symptoms of VDT are related primarily to hypercalcemia, with complications encompassing adverse events in the cardiovascular, renal, gastrointestinal, neurological, and musculoskeletal systems. VDT prevalence is unknown, but it is rare due to the wide therapeutic index of vitamin D. Evidence from systematic studies of VDT in humans is missing for ethical reasons, and data mostly stem from animal studies and anecdotal reports.

The aim of the study was to evaluate the effects of vitamin D on transient elastography (TE, FibroScan) indices of liver steatosis (controlled attenuation parameter [CAP]) and fibrosis (liver stiffness measurement [LSM]) in adults with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).

In this randomized (2:1), double-blind, single-centre, 12-month trial, patients with NAFLD were treated with vitamin D (1000 IU/day) (n = 201) or a matching placebo (n = 110). Two co-primary outcomes were changes in CAP and LSM after 360 days of treatment versus baseline. Two main secondary outcomes were CAP/LSM changes after 180 days of treatment.

Both CAP and LSM gradually decreased in vitamin D-treated patients and slightly increased in the placebo arm. Vitamin D was superior to placebo for both primary outcomes (mean differences in CAP and LSM changes: -49.5 dB/m [95% CI -59.5 to -39.4] and -0.72 kPa [95% CI -1.43 to 0.00], respectively) and both secondary outcomes (-22.1 dB/m [-32.1 to -12.1] and -0.89 kPa [-1.61 to -0.17], respectively). Of a number of exploratory outcomes (change at 12 months vs. baseline), vitamin D reduced serum uric acid (-17.9 μmol/L [-30.6 to -5.2]), gamma-glutamyltransferase (-8.9 IU/L [-15.5 to -2.3]), and fasting serum insulin levels (-5.1 pmol/L [-9.3 to -0.8]) as well as the homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance index (-1.6 [-3.1 to -0.2]) (false discovery rate [5%]-adjusted P-values between .0572 and .0952).

In conclusion, low-medium dose supplementation of vitamin D (1000 IU/day) over 12 months reduces TE indices of liver steatosis (CAP) and fibrosis.
