## Question

Etiology of tympanic membrane that looks like there is a layer of skin over it in a 15 year old girl

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the most likely etiologies of a tympanic membrane that appears to have a "layer of skin over it" in a 15-year-old girl, and to outline a diagnostic and management plan. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what the otoscopic description most plausibly represents. Then, I should verify the differential diagnosis and rank it by likelihood in this age group. Next, I will consider key modifiers such as prior tympanostomy tubes, Eustachian tube dysfunction, and trauma. After that, I need to outline the diagnostic workup, including pneumatic otoscopy, tympanometry, and when to use imaging. Finally, I will synthesize the most likely etiologies and propose management pathways with appropriate counseling and follow-up, ensuring I double-check guideline-concordant care at each step [^1126XHCh] [^112JpuvH].

> Let me first interpret the phrase "looks like there is a layer of skin over it". Wait, let me verify what that could mean on otoscopy. A pearly white, keratinized, or leathery appearance often corresponds to squamous epithelium, which is not normally present on the medial surface of the tympanic membrane; this immediately raises concern for cholesteatoma, particularly when there is a retraction pocket or a lesion behind an intact membrane, as cholesteatoma is literally "skin in the wrong place" and classically appears as a white, pearly mass in the attic or posterior superior quadrant [^117QjDeW] [^115kXJmi]. I should also consider tympanosclerosis, which can look like chalky white plaques on the membrane and is a common sequela of prior otitis media or tube placement, and myringosclerosis, which can mimic a "skin layer" but is typically flat and plaque-like rather than a mass or pocket [^113W9iyC] [^114dmYaq]. Hold on, I should verify that a keratin horn or focal epithelial overgrowth could also present as a horn-like keratin projection and might be described as a "skin layer", though this is rare and more typical in older adults; still, I should keep it in mind if the lesion is focal and horn-like [^113NYSaD].

> Next, I should review the differential diagnosis and rank likelihoods. Cholesteatoma is high on the list because adolescents are a common age for acquired disease, especially with a history of Eustachian tube dysfunction or prior middle ear pathology; the classic pearly white appearance and predilection for the pars flaccida or posterior superior pars tensa fit the description well [^115yGxg7] [^117QjDeW]. Tympanosclerosis/myringosclerosis is also highly plausible as a common sequela of childhood OME or tympanostomy tubes and can produce a white, leathery-appearing membrane that might be described as "skin over it" [^113W9iyC] [^114dmYaq]. But wait, what if this is a retraction pocket without frank cholesteatoma? Retraction pockets can look like a "second layer" due to the invaginated membrane and can progress to cholesteatoma, so I need to check for stage and stability on serial exams [^116mf9DB] [^117VDQXd]. Less likely but possible are fibroma or fibrosis of the tympanic membrane, which can present as a thickened, whitish membrane with conductive hearing loss, and very rarely a keratin horn arising from the membrane surface [^11171Zqt] [^112iKLKw] [^113NYSaD].

> I will now examine key modifiers that shift probabilities. Let me consider Eustachian tube dysfunction first, because chronic negative or poorly regulated middle ear pressure drives retraction pockets and acquired cholesteatoma; adolescents with allergic rhinitis, adenoid hypertrophy, or recurrent URIs are at increased risk, and ETD is a primary driver of TM retraction and cholesteatoma formation in this age group [^115S54w7] [^112zLNJT]. I should confirm whether there is a history of tympanostomy tubes, because myringosclerosis and tympanosclerosis are substantially more common after tube placement and can persist long term, altering TM appearance and mobility [^114dmYaq] [^113W9iyC]. Hold on, I should verify trauma or habitual autoinflation as contributors; repeated Valsalva maneuvers can generate positive pressure and, in the presence of a thinned fibrous layer, lead to ballooning herniation of the TM, which could be misread as a "skin layer" if the epithelium is prominent, though this is rare and typically bulges outward rather than forming a pocket [^111P199e] [^1116F8Wn].

> Next, I should review the diagnostic workup. I need to ensure meticulous pneumatic otoscopy to document mobility, retraction, and the presence of a pocket or mass; a retraction pocket with keratin debris or a pearly white lesion behind an intact membrane strongly suggests cholesteatoma, whereas a flat, plaque-like white discoloration without a pocket favors tympanosclerosis [^114CU1fy] [^117QjDeW]. I should double-check with tympanometry to assess middle ear pressure and effusion; a flat type B tracing supports effusion or poor mobility, while a type C pattern suggests negative pressure consistent with ETD and retraction, and tympanometry is recommended when pneumatic otoscopy is equivocal or technically limited [^116ziDYg] [^111nq8E7]. If cholesteatoma is suspected or if the lesion is atypical, high-resolution temporal bone CT can delineate extent, bony erosion, and surgical planning; MRI may help distinguish cholesteatoma from other soft-tissue lesions when CT is indeterminate, though CT remains first-line for suspected cholesteatoma [^115dxUzg] [^115yGxg7]. I should confirm hearing status with age-appropriate audiometry given the risk of conductive loss with retraction, cholesteatoma, or tympanosclerosis [^112JpuvH].

> Let me synthesize the most likely etiologies now. Given the description of a "layer of skin" and the adolescent context, acquired cholesteatoma arising from a retraction pocket is the leading diagnosis, particularly if the lesion is pearly white, located in the attic or posterior superior quadrant, and associated with ETD or prior middle ear disease; the pathogenesis via negative pressure and squamous epithelium trapping fits the clinical picture [^115yGxg7] [^117QjDeW]. A close second is tympanosclerosis/myringosclerosis, especially with a history of OME or tympanostomy tubes; the chalky white plaques or generalized thickening can mimic a "skin layer" but typically lack a retraction pocket or keratin debris [^113W9iyC] [^114dmYaq]. I should also keep in mind a stable retraction pocket without cholesteatoma as a precursor state that requires surveillance for progression, and consider rare entities like fibroma or keratin horn if the appearance is atypical or mass-like rather than plaque-like or pocketed [^116mf9DB] [^11171Zqt] [^113NYSaD].

> Now, I need to outline management pathways and ensure they align with guidelines. If cholesteatoma is suspected, I should refer promptly to pediatric otolaryngology for surgical management because of the risk of bone erosion, hearing loss, and intracranial complications; definitive treatment is surgical excision with restoration of the tympanic membrane and ossicular chain as needed, and preoperative imaging guides extent and approach [^117QjDeW] [^115yGxg7]. If tympanosclerosis is diagnosed and hearing is stable, observation with periodic otoscopy and audiometry is reasonable, as myringosclerosis often remains stable and may not require intervention unless there is significant conductive loss or cosmetic concern; counseling about the benign nature and sequelae of prior disease is important [^113W9iyC] [^114dmYaq]. For a retraction pocket without cholesteatoma, a watchful waiting strategy with 3–6 month surveillance is acceptable in mild cases, but I should escalate to ventilation tubes or tympanoplasty if there is progression, hearing loss, or signs of cholesteatoma formation; shared decision-making with the family is essential given the risk of progression [^116mf9DB] [^117VDQXd] [^112JpuvH].

> I should double-check supportive and preventive measures. Addressing Eustachian tube dysfunction with allergy management, treatment of upper airway obstruction, and counseling to avoid forceful autoinflation can reduce ongoing negative pressure and recurrence risk; in select refractory ETD cases, balloon dilation may be considered, though long-term pediatric data are limited and decisions should be individualized [^115S54w7] [^1116F8Wn]. If there is a history of tympanostomy tubes, I need to document TM changes clearly and counsel that myringosclerosis and tympanosclerosis are recognized sequelae that often do not require treatment unless symptomatic, while maintaining vigilance for persistent perforation or cholesteatoma in the long term [^114dmYaq] [^113qYyU9] [^115wS23m].

> Final reasoning summary: The most likely explanation for a TM that appears to have a "layer of skin over it" in a 15-year-old girl is acquired cholesteatoma arising from a retraction pocket, given the classic pearly appearance and the adolescent predilection for acquired disease; tympanosclerosis or myringosclerosis is a close alternative, particularly with a history of OME or tympanostomy tubes, and a stable retraction pocket without cholesteatoma remains a key precursor to monitor. Accurate diagnosis relies on pneumatic otoscopy, tympanometry, and selective imaging, with management ranging from observation for stable, noncholesteatomatous lesions to surgical excision for cholesteatoma, all aligned with pediatric otology guidelines and shared decision-making with the family [^117QjDeW] [^116ziDYg] [^112JpuvH].

The most likely cause of a tympanic membrane that appears to have a "skin layer" over it in a 15-year-old girl is **tympanosclerosis** (myringosclerosis) [^113W9iyC], a common sequela of chronic otitis media or tympanostomy tubes, characterized by **calcific plaques** on the TM that can resemble a skin-like layer. Other considerations include **retraction pockets** from chronic Eustachian tube dysfunction [^116mf9DB], which can appear as a thin, skin-like membrane due to negative pressure, and **cholesteatoma**, a keratinizing epithelial growth that can present as a pearly white mass behind the TM [^112ktyfx]. Less common causes include fibroma, keratin horn, or post-inflammatory fibrosis [^11171Zqt] [^113NYSaD] [^112iKLKw]. Evaluation should include pneumatic otoscopy, tympanometry, and high-resolution CT if cholesteatoma is suspected [^115dxUzg] [^115yGxg7].

## Differential diagnosis

| **Condition** | **Description** | **Clinical features** | **Etiology** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Tympanosclerosis (myringosclerosis) | Calcific plaques on the TM | - White, chalky, skin-like patches <br/> - Often bilateral <br/> - May cause mild conductive hearing loss | Chronic otitis media or tympanostomy tubes [^113W9iyC] [^114dmYaq] |
| Retraction pockets | TM invagination due to negative pressure | - Skin-like appearance <br/> - Often in pars flaccida <br/> - May progress to cholesteatoma | Chronic Eustachian tube dysfunction [^116mf9DB] [^112zLNJT] |
| Cholesteatoma | Keratinizing epithelial growth | - Pearly white mass behind TM <br/> - May erode bone <br/> - Conductive hearing loss | Chronic Eustachian tube dysfunction or retraction pockets [^115yGxg7] [^117QjDeW] |
| Fibroma | Benign fibrous tumor of the TM | - Thick, skin-like TM <br/> - Progressive conductive hearing loss | Unknown, rare [^11171Zqt] |
| Keratin horn | Hyperkeratotic projection from the TM | - Horn-like keratin mass <br/> - Rare | Chronic irritation or inflammation [^notfound] |
| Post-inflammatory fibrosis | Fibrotic thickening of the TM | - Thick, skin-like TM <br/> - Conductive hearing loss | Chronic inflammation or infection [^112iKLKw] |

## Diagnostic evaluation

- **Pneumatic otoscopy**: Assess TM mobility and differentiate tympanosclerosis, retraction pockets, and cholesteatoma [^114CU1fy].
- **Tympanometry**: Objective assessment of middle ear status and TM mobility [^116ziDYg].
- **High-resolution CT**: If cholesteatoma is suspected, to assess extent and bony erosion [^117QjDeW] [^115dxUzg].
- **Audiometry**: Evaluate hearing loss and guide management [^112YAxw6].

---

## Management

- **Tympanosclerosis**: Observation unless significant hearing loss or cosmetic concern; surgical intervention if indicated [^notfound].
- **Retraction pockets**: Observation with regular follow-up; surgical intervention if progression or cholesteatoma formation [^1156Q5DX] [^117VDQXd].
- **Cholesteatoma**: Surgical excision and reconstruction of the TM and ossicular chain [^116nEerj] [^113svd1m].
- **Fibroma or keratin horn**: Surgical excision if symptomatic or cosmetically concerning [^11171Zqt] [^113NYSaD].

---

The most likely cause is **tympanosclerosis**, but retraction pockets and cholesteatoma must be excluded. Accurate diagnosis with otoscopy, tympanometry, and imaging guides appropriate management.

Literature review

Eustachian tube dysfunction is defined by signs and symptoms of pressure dysregulation in the middle ear such as 'aural fullness', 'popping', discomfort, pain or 'under water sensation'and represents a common problem with reported incidences ranging from 0.9% to 5%.

According to Schilder et al, the three subtypes of Eustachian tube dysfunction include barochallenge-induced dysfunction in conditions of alteration of the ambient pressure, patulous Eustachian tube dysfunction and dilatory Eustachian tube dysfunction. The latter can be broken down into functional obstruction, dynamic dysfunction due to muscular failure and anatomical obstruction.

Acute episodes are often preceded by an upper respiratory tract infection, or exacerbation of allergic rhinitis, which causes inflammation in the Eustachian tube orifice or lumen. Chronic Eustachian tube dysfunction is defined by symptoms lasting for more than 3 months and has been associated with damage to the middle ear and the eardrum. Complications include otitis media with effusion (glue ear), middle ear atelectasis (retraction of the eardrum) and chronic otitis media with defects of the tympanic membrane. Consequently, it must be considered the primary cause of herniation of the tympanic membrane.

We found the earliest mention referring to a 'hernia of the tympanic membrane' dating back to 4 November 1932. In a written protocol of a case discussion in 'The Section of Otology' a 24-year-old male patient was presented, who reported otorrhea from childhood up to the age of 17, which then dried up. Seven years later, the ear discharged again for several days. On examination, the right drum was red and bulging, but painless and without inflammation. Hearing by air conduction was reduced. Decades before the possibility to perform cross-sectional imaging, the authors discussed the following questions. 'Is this a hernia of the middle layer of the drum, or is it a cholesteatoma, and if so, is the radical mastoid operation justifiable in view of the fact that the only symptom of the patient is deafness in the right ear? Should one perform paracentesis?' They agreed on performing a conventional anteroposterior view radiography of the petrous bone, which showed no bony abnormalities. A subsequently performed paracentesis revealed 'very thick tenacious mucus'. The final diagnosis in this case remains unknown.

Tympanostomy tubes — long-term tympanic membrane changes and subsequent surgery risk are described as follows: tubes produce visible tympanic membrane changes and may cause a small or trivial decrease in long-term hearing levels that do not appear to be clinically significant or require intervention in most patients; persistent perforation is the sequela most likely to require intervention, with 80%-90% success rates for surgical closure with a single outpatient procedure; treatment with tubes was associated with a 9.5-times greater risk of subsequent tympanoplasty versus middle ear disease not treated with tubes and a > 200-times greater risk versus no ear disease.

### The prevalence of tympanic membrane and related middle ear pathology in children: a large longitudinal cohort study followed from birth to age ten [^112YTyyv]. Otology & Neurotology (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To record with video-otoscopy the appearance of the tympanic membranes of a cross section of children aged 9 to 10 years.

Study Design

Cross-sectional study nested within an established longitudinal study of childhood development, the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children.

Setting

South West England, U.K.

Participants

Approximately 6908 of 7261 children with ages ranging from 105 to 140 months born between April 1, 1991, and December 31, 1992, were examined by trained technicians with video-otoscopy.

Main Outcome Measures

Two photographs were taken of each child's tympanic membranes to show the features of the pars tensa and the pars flaccida.

Results

In just less than three quarters of the children, both ears were normal. Retraction of the pars flaccida was present in 9.6% of children, and that of the pars tensa was present in 7.9%. Most of these changes were mild with few severe retractions. There were 15 cases of overt or suspected cholesteatoma.

Conclusion

The tympanic membrane changes reflect most of the middle ear disease seen in 9- to 10-year-old children. The prevalence is low, and few children have serious disease at this stage.

### Bilateral keratin horns arising from the tympanic membranes: a case report [^113NYSaD]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2015). Low credibility.

A keratin horn is a horn-like projection composed of dense keratotic material. It usually arises in sun-exposed areas of the body. It can be derived from a variety of underlying benign, premalignant, or malignant epidermal lesions. Risk factors associated with malignant change within a keratin horn include a wide base, male sex, and increasing age, in addition to an origin in a sun-exposed area. The mainstay of management is to obtain a biopsy from the base of the horn and subsequent excision if the histopathologic analysis suggests a malignancy. We report an extremely rare case of bilateral keratin horns arising from the tympanic membranes in a 64-year-old woman. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of its kind to be published in the English-language literature.

### Rare case of ballooning herniation of the tympanic membrane [^1169dzPF]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Background

Although bulging of the tympanic membrane is commonly encountered, a ballooning herniation occupying the external auditory canal is extremely rare. The development of these lesions is thought to require a pre-existing defect of the tympanic membrane and recurrent positive pressure inside the middle ear. Habitual Valsalva manoeuvres, the so-called 'autoinflation', can transiently relieve symptoms in these patients but are also part of the pathomechanism in the first place. Severe cases are recommended to be treated surgically, while in mild cases observation may be a reasonable approach.

### Fibroma of the tympanic membrane [^11171Zqt]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2009). Low credibility.

A primary tumor of the tympanic membrane is very rare. Herein, we describe a patient with a thick tympanic membrane that caused progressive hearing loss. The patient was treated with total resection of the tympanic membrane and was diagnosed with fibroma after histopathologic examination. There was no evidence of recurrence 2 years after the operation, and the patient's hearing was normal. Fibroma may arise in the tympanic membrane and should be regarded as a possible cause of the mass of the tympanic membrane.

### Evidence showing three layers of reconstructed tympanic membrane after second regenerative treatment [^113oPXa9]. Otology & Neurotology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To describe the case of a patient who twice underwent recently developed regenerative treatment for tympanic membrane perforation (RT-TMP), achieving successful regeneration of the TM consisting of three layers (epidermis, lamina propria, and mucosa) on pathological analyses of the regenerated part.

Study Design

Clinical capsule report.

Patient

A 48-year-old woman with right chronic otitis media, showing a large TMP covering 80% of the total TM.

Interventions

After the initial RT-TMP, the patient had a residual posterior TMP affecting 25% of the TM. At the second procedure, a portion of the previously regenerated TM was harvested for pathological analysis.

Results

Pathological analysis of the surgical specimen showed that the regenerated TM tissue coandnsisted of three parts: outer epidermal, intermediate, and mucosal layers.

Conclusion

By applying a recently developed RT-TMP, this report describes the first human study confirming the regeneration of the TM consisting of three layers (epidermis, lamina propria, and mucosa) on pathological analyses of the regenerated part at the second RT-TMP. This is a major step toward the goal of TM regeneration that recapitulates the structural properties of the native TM.

### Postauricular feather foreign body in an infant [^116suvDr]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

A male infant presented with reduced oral intake, low-grade fever and postauricular erythema. Clinical examination revealed a soft, tender swelling posteroinferior to the mastoid tip with a dull tympanic membrane on otoscopy. Cross-sectional imaging did not show any evidence of middle ear infection or mastoiditis. However, there was minimal change in clinical status despite trialling various intravenous antibiotics. One week after admission, a thin, white foreign body self-extruded from the upper part of the postauricular skin, recognised by the child's parents as a feather from their sofa cushion. The suspected mechanism was the penetration of the feather into the skin when the child was lying on the sofa. While incredibly rare, soft tissue foreign bodies should be considered in paediatric patients with postauricular swelling not responding to antibiotics.

### The diagnosis and management of acute otitis media [^114CU1fy]. Pediatrics (2013). Medium credibility.

Tympanic membrane (TM) appearance and mobility — signs associated with middle ear effusion (MEE): The normal TM is translucent, pearly gray, and has a ground-glass appearance, and specific landmarks including the short process and the manubrium of the malleus and the pars flaccida can be visualized. Inward movement of the TM on positive pressure and outward movement on negative pressure should occur; when the TM is retracted, the short process of the malleus becomes more prominent and the manubrium appears shortened. Inward motion with positive pressure may be restricted or absent but outward mobility can be seen when negative pressure is applied. If the TM does not move perceptibly with gentle positive or negative pressure, MEE is likely, and application of pressure may make an air-fluid interface behind the TM more evident, which is diagnostic of MEE.

### Cholesteatoma behind an intact tympanic membrane: histopathologic evidence for a tympanic membrane origin [^117FAkS2]. Otology & Neurotology (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Several theories have been proposed with respect to the origin and pathogenesis of cholesteatoma behind an intact tympanic membrane.

Case Report

The authors describe a case of cholesteatoma behind an intact tympanic membrane in a 71-year-old man with a history of tympanic membrane retraction fixed to the incus without evidence of a perforation. The membrane eventually became detached, and remnants of keratinizing squamous epithelium were found on the incus.

Discussion

Mechanisms such as metaplasia, ectopic epidermis rests, or ingrowth of meatal epidermis have been proposed to explain the pathogenesis of cholesteatoma behind an intact tympanic membrane. These findings, based on temporal bone histopathology, support the role of an acquired epidermal rest.

Conclusions

This case report provides evidence that cholesteatoma behind an intact tympanic membrane can be established from a resolved retraction of the pars tensa of the tympanic membrane.

### External and middle ear diseases: radiological diagnosis based on clinical signs and symptoms [^115dxUzg]. Insights Into Imaging (2012). Low credibility.

Middle ear

The middle ear is hidden behind the tympanic membrane, what makes direct non-invasive evaluation limited in many cases.

Although the pathology itself can be well estimated on otoscopic examination, further questions concerning the extent of the disease, exact location, structures involved and possible bone erosion, will be addressed in detail only with CT and/or MRI.

The majority of everyday practice cases will consist of inflammatory diseases, either chronic or acute, and sometimes tumours. On CT examination, these entities will demonstrate a mass, or a diffuse opacification of middle ear cavity.

Since an opacified middle ear is a common finding on imaging studies, a practical classification has been used, in order to facilitate differential diagnosis (Table 3).

### The natural course of tympanic membrane retractions in the posterosuperior quadrant of pars tensa: a watchful waiting policy [^116mf9DB]. Otology & Neurotology (2021). Medium credibility.

Tympanic membrane retraction (TMR) is a condition in which part of the tympanic membrane is retracted into the middle ear cavity (also called retraction pocket) and is frequently seen in (pediatric) otorhinolaryngology. The prevalence of TMR in children is reported to be 8% to 10%, mostly being mild cases in the pars tensa (Sade classification I). As most (epidemiological) studies have been performed in children, the prevalence of TMR in adults is largely unknown.

Persistent or temporary negative middle ear pressure, which is caused mainly by a dysfunction of the Eustachian tube or by inflammation, is considered a main causal factor in the etiology of TMRs. TMRs are frequently localized in the posterosuperior quadrant of the pars tensa and in the pars flaccida. One of the proposed explanations for this localization is because the posterosuperior quadrant of the pars tensa lacks a well-developed circular fibrous layer. Furthermore, it is well vascularized and therefore more vulnerable to infiltration of inflammatory cells and mediators. During inflammation, these cells secrete collagenases and elastases that results in damage of collagen fibers, which could weaken the integrity and composition of the tympanic membrane architecture. The propensity of the pars flaccida and posterior pars tensa to retraction can also be related to the different embryological origin of the eardrum in these specific sites compared with the rest of the tympanic membrane.

### External and middle ear diseases: radiological diagnosis based on clinical signs and symptoms [^117QjDeW]. Insights Into Imaging (2012). Low credibility.

In cases of post-inflammatory ossicular chain erosion, any or all of three signs will not be visualised on axial CT scans.

Differential diagnosis includes congenital ossicular deformity, cholesteatoma with ossicular erosion, post-operative ossicular loss.

Post-inflammatory erosion sometimes involves walls of tympanic cavity. Based on CT multiplanar images the following structures should first of all be evaluated:
Bony cover of lateral semicircular canal
Bony cover of the second (tympanic) segment of the facial nerve
Roof of the middle ear cavity (tegmen tympani)

Chronic otitis media with acquired cholesteatoma

Definition

Cholesteatoma means "skin in the wrong place". It consists of squamous epithelium that is trapped within the middle ear and mastoid.

In the setting of chronic middle ear inflammation, cholesteatomas arise as the result of tympanic membrane retraction or perforation.

The classic acquired cholesteatoma develops from medial retraction of the pars flaccida into the epitympanum (pars flaccida cholesteatoma). As this process continues, the scutum becomes eroded; ossicular destruction is common. If the cholesteatoma invades posteriorly into the aditus ad antrum and the mastoid itself, erosion of the tegmen tympani, with exposure of the dura and/or erosion of the lateral semicircular canal may appear (Fig. 24).

Fig. 24
Chronic middle ear inflammation with cholesteatoma. Coronal CT scan demonstrates lateral semicircular canal fistula (arrowhead), caused by erosion of bone covering the canal due to growing cholesteatoma

A second, less frequent type of an acquired cholesteatoma arises when the posterior quadrant of the tympanic membrane is retracted into the posterior middle ear (pars tensa cholesteatoma). As retraction continues, squamous epithelium envelops the suprastructure of the stapes and fills in sinus tympani. Cholesteatomas arising from the posterior tympanic membrane are likely to produce facial nerve exposure, eroding bony cover of facial nerve canal, and destruction of the stapedial suprastructure.

Symptoms

Those symptoms typical for cholesteatoma include painless otorrhea, persistent or frequently recurrent in spite of aggressive antibiotic treatment, conductive hearing loss, rarely vertigo.

### Lateralization of the tympanic membrane as a complication of canal wall down tympanoplasty: a report of four cases [^116ETxa2]. Otology & Neurotology (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe the pathophysiology and treatment of the lateralized tympanic membrane that occurs after canal wall down tympanoplasty.

Study Design

Retrospective case review.

Setting

Tertiary referral hospital.

Patients

Four patients in whom lateralization of the tympanic membrane developed as a complication of canal wall down tympanoplasty.

Results

The patients had undergone middle ear surgery 20 to 34 years before their first visit to the authors. A Bondy operation with soft-wall reconstruction of the ear canal had been performed in three patients and a modified radical mastoidectomy in one patient. They all had severe conductive hearing loss. Common findings were anterior canal sulcus blunting, good tubal function, normal middle ear mucosa, and mobile stapes. At revision surgery, the lateralized tympanic membrane was removed, and the temporalis fascia was grafted medial to the malleus manubrium. The exposed bony surface in the ear canal was covered with a split-thickness skin graft, and the ear canal and the mastoid cavity were tightly packed to secure the graft. All the patients regained good hearing after the revision. Although deterioration of the anterior tympanic ring was presumed to be the primary cause of the graft lateralization, the lack of a posterior bony ear canal might have facilitated this condition.

Conclusion

Lateralization of the tympanic membrane can occur even in an ear with a radicalized mastoid cavity, especially when the anterior tympanic ring is torn and the posterior ear canal is reconstructed with soft tissue.

### Rare case of ballooning herniation of the tympanic membrane [^111P199e]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Pathomechanism

According to Ikeda et al, there are two conditions required for the formation of a herniation of the tympanic membrane. The first is a pre-existing defect in the pars tensa of the tympanic membrane, which, for example, occurs in otitis media with perforation or iatrogenic due to paracentesis. After remission, the second requirement is a recurrent positive pressure inside the middle ear, that can force the 'scarred' and thinned portion of the tympanic membrane laterally into the external ear canal.

Positive pressure (the pulsion) inside the middle ear can lead to a transient bulging of the tympanic membrane, which is commonly encountered among patients with acute otitis media, trumpet players or after Valsalva manoeuvre. Patients who suffer from chronic otitis media with effusion often report about aural fullness. They tend to repeatedly perform Valsalva manoeuvres to create positive middle ear pressure by opening the Eustachian tube, which allows a better drainage of the fluid.

Besides this method is also commonly recommended by physicians to reduce symptoms of otitis media with effusion as a low-cost and effective therapy.

Sadé described 'hyperectasis' of the tympanic membrane as a condition where either a small or large part of the tympanic membrane bulges above the physiological level.

The authors of this study believe that hyperectasis is equivalent to a bulging of the tympanic membrane involving all three layers. In the presence of a pre-existing defect of the fibrous layer, excessive autoinflation can cause a herniation of the tympanic membrane.

In this scenario, a two-layer hernia can develop through the thinned portions of the tympanic membrane.

These hernias show a higher compliance and in extreme cases, a 'ballooning effect' can lead to a complete occupation of the external auditory canal.

Pediatric ear impressions and dermatitis — Ear impression taking carries risks including impaction of cerumen, injury to the ear canal or tympanic membrane, injection of material into the middle ear space, and contact dermatitis from impression materials; some earmold or earshell materials also carry risk of contact dermatitis, so a case history of prior skin reactions should precede impressions, selection of lower allergenic materials can assist though not eliminate reactions, patients with pre-existing ear abnormalities are at greater risk, and contact dermatitis risk from impressions and/or earpiece use depends on material type and patient susceptibility.

### Rare case of ballooning herniation of the tympanic membrane [^1116F8Wn]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Treatment

Current therapy recommendations are based on individual case reports and options depend on the extent of the bulging of the tympanic membrane. In severe cases with occlusion of the external auditory canal surgical treatment with hernia excision and tympanoplasty is generally accepted. In addition, ventilation tubes can be inserted after tympanoplasty to equalise middle ear pressure and prevent the recollection of a middle ear effusion.

In mild cases, it is recommended to observe or suggest a reduction of Valsalva manoeuvre frequency to once a day.

The bulging of the tympanic membrane normally diminishes or remains unchanged after conservative treatment. In Sadé's case series of 59 conservatively treated patients, the membrane persisted in its hyperinflated state for weeks, months and even years. Any attempt to equalise the pressure by myringotomy or pressure equalisation tubes will only increase the conductive hearing loss and result in an unsatisfied patient.

As Eustachian tube dysfunction must be considered the primary cause it should be addressed to prevent hernia formation in the first place and to limit postoperative recurrence of the disease. This can include medical treatment with nasal steroids, topical decongestants or antihistamines. Current studies suggest that surgical balloon dilation of the Eustachian tube can be a helpful therapy, although long-term data are not yet available.

Present evidence to support its alternatives, such as laser Eustachian tuboplasty and microdebrider Eustachian tuboplasty, is limited in quantity and of poor quality.

Although Sadé described cases of a ballooning tympanic membrane returning to its physiological level after being punctured, we do not recommend this approach.

Differential diagnosis

A bullous mass as presented in figure 1 can generally derive from the external ear canal, the tympanic membrane or neighbouring structures such as bones, nerves or in rare cases even the meninges or parotid gland. The overall appearance of the mass in our case with its round, smooth and compressible surface is suggestive for a benign air-filled or liquid-filled cyst, which helps to differentiate from many other possible pathologies.

Primary tumours deriving from the tympanic membrane are extremely rare, but case reports are published about a noncholesteatomous cystas well as capillary haemangioma, fibroma, schwannomaand paraganglioma. Benign formations in the external auditory canal include osteomas, dermatofibromas, cholesteatomasand ceruminous adenomas.

A case of an isolated squamous cell carcinoma of the tympanic membrane was published in 2002, but like osteomas, exostosis of the ear canal and advanced stage carcinomas of the parotid gland, these are expected to be more solid on palpation. Taking the incidence as well as the clinical appearance of our case into account, we consider sebaceous cysts of the skin and cholesteatomas of the middle ear or external auditory canal as relevant differential diagnoses.

Petrous bone CT imaging is guiding to evaluate the extent, infiltrative pattern, bone destruction and preoperative anatomy. It helped to confirm our diagnosis by demonstrating an air-filled herniation of the tympanic membrane, which excludes all the above-mentioned pathologies.

To emphasise the importance of preoperative imaging in indefinite lesions, we would like to mention a case of meningioma, which led to bulging of the tympanic membrane and was diagnosed by paracentesis with biopsy.

### Clinical practice guideline: tympanostomy tubes in children (update) [^113qYyU9]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Tympanostomy tube otorrhea and complications — frequencies and management — are reported as follows: Acute TTO occurs in up to 50% of children who are closely monitored in RCTs, with cohort studies finding 16% postoperative otorrhea (first 30 days), 26% delayed otorrhea, 7% recurrent otorrhea, and 4% chronic otorrhea. Caregivers should be counseled that TTO responds to topical antibiotic ear drops, does not usually require oral antibiotics, and benefits from water precautions until the discharge is no longer present. Up to 3% of tubes may fail to extrude and require active removal; persistent tympanic membrane perforation occurs with about 2% of short-term tubes and up to 20% of long-term tubes; and localized cholesteatoma may be seen in 0.5% of cases.

### Imaging of conductive hearing loss with a normal tympanic membrane [^112z3eVJ]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

This article presents an approach to imaging conductive hearing loss in patients with normal tympanic membranes and discusses entities that should be checked as the radiologist evaluates this potentially complicated issue.

Conclusion

Conductive hearing loss in a patient with a normal tympanic membrane is a complicated condition that requires a careful imaging approach. Imaging should focus on otosclerosis, and possible mimics and potential surgical considerations should be evaluated. The radiologist should examine the ossicular chain and the round window and keep in mind that a defect in the superior semicircular canal can disturb the hydraulic integrity of the labyrinth.

### Iatrogenic phenol injury causing facial paralysis with tympanic membrane and ossicular necrosis [^111Ts5AK]. Otology & Neurotology (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe a serious iatrogenic injury and propose means of reducing the risk of its reoccurrence.

Patients

A 21-year-old man who suffered facial paralysis, complete necrosis of the tympanic membrane, and ossicular discontinuity because of chemical burn from accidental application of copious amounts of topical anesthetic phenol into the ear.

Interventions

Conservative management of facial paralysis and delayed reconstruction of the tympanic membrane and ossicular chain.

Main Outcome Measures

Gradual recovery to grade 1/6 facial function, successful repair of the tympanic membrane, but persistent 30-dB conductive hearing loss after partial ossicular replacement prosthesis presumably because of scarring.

Conclusion

Phenol is a highly toxic chemical, topically to both skin and eyes. Absorbed through the skin it can have lethal cardiotoxicity. It is also potent neurotoxin at concentrations much lower (4–7%) than used for tympanic membrane anesthesia (89%) and has long been used therapeutically to destroy nerves in patients of contractions or intractable pain. Otologists need to have a healthy respect for the dangers of using phenol. As only a minute quantity is needed for tympanic anesthesia, commercially available prepackaged applicators are preferred. Storage of stock bottles of 89% phenol solutions in clinical settings risks injury to both patients and practitioners.

### Otitis media in young children [^117FxXQs]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on acute otitis media:

- **Definition**: AOM is defined as an infection of the middle ear space.
- **Pathophysiology**: AOM is mostly caused by bacteria (S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis) followed by viruses.
- **Disease course**: The inflammatory disease due to middle ear space infection with particular involvement of the tympanic membrane results in AOM, which presents with clinical presentations of earache, otorrhea, headache, fever, general malaise, and hearing impairment. AOM is a self-limiting condition.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: AOM is not associated with an increase in mortality.

### Foreign body granuloma originating from the lateral process of malleus: a case series of 19 children [^114aVU8p]. Otology & Neurotology (2023). Medium credibility.

In our study, FBGLP mainly occurred during an acute course (10 days to 3 months), and all included patients were children (100%, 19/19). Our study population included only two adults, who were excluded owing to loss to follow-up after granuloma excision, whereas we encountered 19 children with this condition. This may be due to the children's relatively straight and narrow EAC, which induces poor self-cleaning and self-healing abilities. Keratin and other endogenous foreign bodies are difficult to degrade; therefore, if they remain in the EAC, they stimulate and damage the surface of the tympanic membrane, which further induces giant cell reactions. Interestingly, FBGLP may be related to the unique anatomic structure of the lateral process of the malleus. Anatomically, the lateral process of the malleus is prominent and forms the boundary between the pars flaccida and the pars tensa. The pars tensa of the tympanic membrane consists of three layers: the epithelium, the fibrous, and the mucosal layers. However, the lateral process of the malleus lacks a fibrous layer, which makes it more susceptible to foreign body stimulation and skin damage leading to subsequent inflammation or exudation. Furthermore, the blood supply and innervation are relatively abundant in this region, which facilitates formation of vascularized granulomas.

Clinically, foreign body granulomas present in the EAC should be distinguished from other types of granulomas. Granular myringitis, also called chronic myringitis, myringitis granulosa, granulomatous myringitis, granulating myringitis, and granular external otitis is an uncommon inflammatory disorder of the tympanic membrane. It is characterized by chronic, painless otorrhea with blocked epithelialization and granulation tissue formation over the involved area. Etiologically, nonspecific injury of the tympanic lamina propria induces hyperplasia of the granulation tissue, which may disturb epithelial migration. In addition, granulomas of the EAC, such as outer or middle ear inflammation, cholesteatoma, and childhood malignant tumors, can be the first sign of various etiologies. Deep ear lesions are easily ignored due to a granuloma blocking the EAC; therefore, timely imaging examination is necessary to determine the extent of the lesion. If required, biopsy can help to confirm the diagnosis.

### Otomycosis with tympanic membrane perforation: a review of the literature [^114tycwx]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

The purpose of the present study was to assess the rate of tympanic membrane perforation in patients with otomycosis and to discuss the literature regarding the difficulties in managing this condition.

Data Sources

Literature review from 1999 to 2019, Web of Science, PubMed, and Medline.

Study Selection

We searched for eligible articles concerning the clinical entity of tympanic membrane perforation secondary to otomycosis. Case series and clinical trials were the types of articles included for this review.

Data Extraction

All the articles described in the study selection were used for this review.

Data Synthesis

Statistical techniques were not used.

Conclusion

Based on the available literature, it seems that tympanic membrane perforation secondary to otomycosis is not uncommon. The presence of this complication is associated with 2 problems: Antimycotic solutions are irritant to middle ear and may be ototoxic to the cochlea. Although most cases of fungus caused tympanic membrane (TM) perforation resolve with proper medical treatment, in a few patients a tympanoplasty may be required.

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^112TDfG3]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis externa with nonintact tympanic membrane — topical therapy selection and evaluation are as follows: When the patient has a known or suspected perforation of the tympanic membrane, including a tympanostomy tube, the clinician should prescribe a nonototoxic topical preparation. Policy level: Recommendation. Aggregate evidence quality: Grade D, reasoning from first principles, and Grade X, exceptional situations in which validating studies cannot be performed. Level of confidence in evidence: Moderate. Benefit: Reduce the possibility of hearing loss and balance disturbance. Risk, harm, cost: Eardrops without ototoxicity may be more costly. Benefits-harms assessment: Preponderance of benefit over harm. Intentional vagueness: None. Role of patient preferences: None. Exceptions: None. Differences of opinion: None. Supporting text notes that antibiotics placed into the middle ear can cross the round window membrane and reach the inner ear and that clinical experience with tympanic membrane perforation suggests that hearing loss does not occur after a single short course of therapy; however, severe hearing loss has been observed after prolonged or repetitive administration of topical drops. Evaluation points include that tympanometry can sometimes be helpful in establishing the presence of an intact tympanic membrane, that when tympanometry shows a normal type A tracing the tympanic membrane is assumed to be intact unless there is a reason to believe it is not, and that most tympanostomy tubes remain in the tympanic membrane for at least 6 to 12 months so a patent tube should be assumed if placed less than a year ago.

### Rare case of ballooning herniation of the tympanic membrane [^115Tw9QF]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Treatment

The patient was young and disturbed by the impaired hearing function as well as recurrent episodes of otitis media. Thus, a surgical treatment was recommended and desired by the patient. The surgical approach was achieved by a retroauricular incision and expansion of the bony external auditory canal. Excision of the herniated part of the right tympanic membrane was performed by an experienced surgeon. Intraoperative inspection of the middle ear revealed unremarkable mucosal tissue and an intact and mobile ossicular chain (figure 6). The defect was closed by installation of an autogenous cartilage perichondrial composite graft deriving from the concha in the sense of an underlay tympanoplasty type I (figure 7). The histological workup showed a hernia sac formed by two epithelial layers, a superficial layer of squamous epithelium and an underlying layer of fibrous cells (figures 8 and 9).

### Beyond the otoscope: an imaging review of congenital cholesteatoma [^115bjTbs]. Insights Into Imaging (2024). Medium credibility.

Etiology

CMECs are generally considered truly congenital, and unlike AC, they are not associated with Eustachian tube dysfunction or tympanic membrane retraction. The "epidermoid formation" theory is one of the most prominent theories regarding its origin and is based upon the discovery of a group of non-keratinizing epidermal cells in the embryonic development of the middle ear. Further growth of this formation could explain why most CCs occur in the anterior-superior quadrant. Other theories include failure in a barrier function of the tympanic ring with migration of ectodermal tissue into the middle ear cleft or implantation of epithelial cells on the malleus handle due to tympanic retraction.

While poorly studied, CPBCs are believed to originate from misplaced ectodermal cells during early embryonic development, potentially sharing a similar origin with intradural epidermoid cysts. Histological studies have proven the existence of an organ in certain fish and birds which originates from ectodermal cells in close proximity to the geniculate ganglion and this entity has also been described as a vestigial structure in human embryos. This is an intriguing yet unproven theory regarding the origin of supralabyrinthine CPBC, especially considering its frequent association with the geniculate ganglion region.

It's important to note that none of these theories provide a definitive explanation for the origin of all CC. It is more likely that different lesions can arise through different mechanisms or even a combination of different mechanisms.

### Post-auricular teratoma in an HIV-exposed newborn [^112V3WPQ]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

Case presentation

Maternal history

A woman in her early 30s, Para 2, was HIV positive before conception and reported to have good adherence to antiretroviral drugs (tenofovir, lamivudine and dolutegravir). Prenatal screening ultrasound was carried out at 7 months of pregnancy which showed a cystic mass involving the right post-auricular area and a plan for delivery at the peripheral hospital was made.

Baby

A baby girl, delivered by spontaneous vaginal delivery at term, cried immediately and had APGAR scores of 7 and 8 at 1 and 5 min, respectively. She weighed 2.5 kg. A swelling was noted soon after delivery at the posterior aspect of the right ear which was slightly tender. The swelling was a variegated mass. It gradually increased in size and produced a foul-smelling pus-like discharge. It was not associated with fever or convulsions, and the infant was breastfeeding normally.

Referral

She was referred to our facility at the age of 15 days. Local examination revealed a mass on the right post-auricular region measuring 12 cm × 18 cm at the greatest dimensions, lobulated, cystic superiorly and firm inferiorly (figure 1A, B). The lesion was not ulcerative or tender. It was mobile with hyperpigmentation of the surrounding skin with the pinna, ear canal and tympanic membrane unaffected. There was no fever.

### Clinical practice guidelines: childhood hearing screening [^113Nf6it]. AAA (2011). Medium credibility.

Immittance screening — tympanometry: Since its development in the 1970's tympanometry has been used to assess middle ear function in the clinical setting and tympanometry is not a test of hearing since it does not test auditory pathways beyond the middle ear. Krueger & Ferguson (2002) identified a high rate of false positives (6.4%) for students failing tympanometry screening as compared to pure tone screening at 35 dB HL, and secondly, tympanometry is a more sensitive tool than the use of a 35 dB screening level to identify students with middle ear effusion. Tympanometry has been used clinically for decades, and it is an accepted clinical standard for identifying the likely presence of otitis media with effusion (OME), and negative middle ear pressure (MEP) causes the tympanic membrane to become retracted and if this condition persists over a period of time, fluid may fill the middle ear space; because negative MEP is a precursor to the formation of middle ear effusion (MEE), it is often studied in young children where the prevalence of OME is greater.

### Clinical practice guideline: tympanostomy tubes in children (update) [^113PBfEg]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Natural history and rationale — Once OME has persisted in both ears for 3 months or longer, the chance of spontaneous resolution is low: approximately 20% within 3 months, 25% after 6 months, and only 30% after 1 year of additional observation. Therefore, most children diagnosed with chronic bilateral OME will fail to improve in a timely fashion, even with prolonged observation. This low probability of resolution creates a need to assess the impact of persistent effusion on a child's QOL and functional health status.

### HRCT imaging of acquired cholesteatoma: a pictorial review [^115yGxg7]. Insights Into Imaging (2019). Medium credibility.

Theories regarding the formation of acquired cholesteatoma

Various theories exist regarding the formation of cholesteatoma; however, none of them explain it completely.

Retraction pocket (invagination) theory

Being the most widely accepted theory, it states that the weakest part of the tympanic membrane (TM), i.e. pars flaccida, retracts because of the negative pressure in the middle ear cavity caused by long-standing eustachian tube dysfunction. This leads to the formation of posterosuperior attic pockets. The self-cleansing mechanism of these pockets is gradually lost with the accumulation of desquamation keratinized epithelial layer of the TM and results in the formation of keratin debris. Repeated superadded infection occurs and later biofilms are also formed over these debris which make them resistant to any antimicrobial therapy.

Invasion

It is also hypothesized that there is an invasion of the keratinized squamous epithelium into the middle ear cavity through small perforations in pars tensa, which forms cholesteatoma.

Metaplasia

Due to the chronic irritation, the keratinized squamous epithelium is formed from the squamous or cuboidal epithelium of the middle ear.

Basal cell hyperplasia

There is a presence of microscopic defects even in the intact TM, through which epithelial cells can invade. These defects serve as direct contact between connective tissue of the mucoperiosteum with a middle ear effusion. In later stages, these areas become totally or partially covered with epithelium, and these epithelial breaks become connected to each other through the organized effusion. The cholesteatoma seems to spread by using the connective tissue as scaffolding.

Thus, acquired cholesteatomas can be classified based on the underlying pathogenesis as either "primary" or "secondary" where primary variety is seen behind pars flaccida of an intact retracted TM and the secondary variety grows into the middle ear through a perforated pars tensa part of TM.

The etiology of bony destruction by cholesteatomas is also debatable. Destruction only by mechanical pressure is unlikely. One of the theories states that production of degrading enzymes by osteoclasts is the cause of bony destruction. Due to its propensity to erode bone, the cholesteatoma can give rise to serious intracranial and extracranial complications.

### Clinical practice guidelines: childhood hearing screening [^113kxkYU]. AAA (2011). Medium credibility.

Childhood hearing screening — OME audiologic characteristics describe OME as characterized by decreased mobility of the tympanic membrane and associated with conductive hearing loss that is variable, fluctuating, and typically in mild degree (15–50 dB HL across the frequencies of 500–4000 Hz); recovery occurs more slowly with each additional episode, and early identification of abnormal middle ear function allows initiation of appropriate treatment, follow-up and possible prevention of conductive hearing loss and sequelae including recurrent acute suppurative otitis media, adhesive otitis media, cholesteatoma, tympanosclerosis, ossicular discontinuity, and cholesterol granuloma.

### Congenital aural fistula developing between the third and fourth hillocks of the embryonal helix and presenting a large temporal mass: a case report [^112xtQgZ]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

This report aimed to introduce a very rare presentation of congenital aural fistula and its treatment. A 13-year-old girl presented with a mass on the right temporal region with protrusion of the helix. She noticed a mass a month previously, and the mass gradually swelled with pain. Pus discharged from the pit behind the helix. Mastoiditis was suspected; however, the tympanic membrane was normal. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a cystic mass in the temporal region. The surgical removal of the mass was performed using a postauricular incision. The mass was cystic and had a stem connected to the pit. Insertion of a probe into the pit showed a connection to the mass. The mass was totally removed with the skin around the pit. Histologically, the cyst connected to the fistula and its lumen was covered with squamous cells. A diagnosis of a congenital aural fistula developed posterior to the helix was made. Considering its location, the fistula had been formed between the third and fourth hillocks of the embryonal helix. Aural fistula developed posteriorly is very rare, and it mimicked a temporal tumor or mastoiditis with a protruding auricle. Careful observation of the skin and consideration from developmental aspects are needed for an accurate diagnosis.

### Osseointegrated hearing device placement in congenital lamellar ichthyosis [^112Xm4zx]. Otology & Neurotology (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To present a case of osseointegrated hearing device placement in a child with conductive hearing loss related to manifestations of congenital lamellar ichthyosis.

Patient

A 5-year-old female patient with congenital lamellar ichthyosis resulting in conductive hearing loss because of bilateral external auditory canal stenosis and tympanic membrane blunting.

Intervention

Unilateral osseointegrated hearing device placement using a traditional skin flap technique.

Main Outcome Measures

Frequency and severity of adverse skin reactions, device usage, and audiometric testing.

Results

After 51 months of follow-up postoperatively, the patient has only required 2 treatments for minor skin reactions (Holgers Grade I). Aided speech reception threshold was 15 dB hearing level (HL) compared to 35 dB HL unaided. The subject has used the device continuously with parental report of improvement in school performance.

Conclusion

Osseointegrated hearing device placement may be a viable option in patients with congenital lamellar ichthyosis despite the skin-related comorbidities known to be associated with this disease condition.

### Clinical practice guideline (update): earwax (cerumen impaction) [^114CKcpD]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Cerumen impaction — definitions and pathophysiology specify that cerumen is defined as a mixture of secretions (sebum with secretions from modified apocrine sweat glands) and sloughed epithelial cells and is a normal substance in the external auditory canal, forming when glandular secretions from the outer two-thirds of the ear canal mix with exfoliated squamous epithelium and normally migrating out via a self-cleaning mechanism assisted by jaw movement. For this guideline, cerumen impaction is an accumulation of cerumen that causes symptoms or prevents a needed assessment of the ear canal, tympanic membrane, or audiovestibular system or both; although "impaction" usually implies cerumen is lodged, wedged, or firmly packed, the definition does not require a complete obstruction and implies the cerumen is associated with symptoms or prevents a necessary ear examination. The term is defined pragmatically to designate cerumen that requires management, whereas some patients have nonimpacted, "asymptomatic" cerumen that does not cause symptoms or prevent assessment, and asymptomatic cerumen does not require active management. Anatomically, cerumen is formed in the outer two-thirds (cartilaginous portion) of the ear canal, not the inner third (bony portion) that ends at the eardrum, and impacted cerumen can completely obstruct the ear canal.

### Natural course of tympanic membrane pathology related to otitis media and ventilation tubes between ages 8 and 18 years [^113W9iyC]. Otology & Neurotology (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To present the course of tympanic membrane pathology in childhood and young adulthood after otitis media (OM) in early life.

Study Design

Prospective follow-up study.

Setting

Community study of a birth cohort.

Patients

Three hundred fifty-eight subjects with a positive and negative history of OM (OM+ or OM-) or ventilation tube insertion (VT+ or VT-) derived from a birth cohort that had been followed-up from preschool to adult age.

Methods

Standardized otomicroscopic examination performed at ages 8 and 18 years.

Main Outcome Measures

Tympanic membrane abnormalities (i.e., tympanosclerosis, atrophy, atelectasis and retraction pockets of the pars tensa, and retraction of the pars flaccida).

Results

At the age of 8 years, tympanic membrane pathology was highly prevalent in the both OM+ subcohorts (OM+VT+, 92% and OM+VT-, 46%), whereas in the OM- ears (11%), tympanic membrane abnormalities were rare. In the subsequent 10-year period, many tympanic membrane abnormalities disappeared spontaneously, although the prevalence of tympanosclerosis remained substantial in the OM+VT+ cohort.

Conclusion

The natural course of most tympanic membrane pathology associated with OM in early life is favorable over time, suggesting an intrinsic repair capacity of the tympanic membrane. Tympanosclerosis, the most prevalent sequelae of OM and treatment with VT, however, shows little tendency of resolution.

### Clinical practice guideline: otitis media with effusion (update) [^1165A9xp]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2016). Medium credibility.

Otitis media with effusion (OME) — key term definitions specify that OME is the presence of fluid in the middle ear without signs or symptoms of acute ear infection, and chronic OME is OME persisting for ≥ 3 mo from the date of onset (if known) or from the date of diagnosis (if onset is unknown). Acute otitis media (AOM) is the rapid onset of signs and symptoms of inflammation of the middle ear, and middle ear effusion is fluid in the middle ear from any cause that is present with both OME and AOM and may persist for weeks or months after AOM resolves. Hearing assessment gathers information about a child's hearing status via caregiver report or formal testing and does not include use of noisemakers or other nonstandardized methods. Pneumatic otoscopy examines middle ear mobility by changing ear canal pressure, with a normal eardrum moving briskly but becoming minimal or sluggish with fluid. A tympanogram objectively measures tympanic membrane vibration and pressure; with fluid the tracing is flat or nearly flat, and with air at abnormal pressure the peak shifts left if negative or right if positive. Conductive hearing loss reflects impaired sound transmission often associated with effusion, whereas sensorineural hearing loss results from abnormal transmission of sound from the sensory cells of the inner ear to the brain.

### Clinical practice guideline: otitis media with effusion (update) [^116ziDYg]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2016). Medium credibility.

Otitis media with effusion (OME) — tympanometry after pneumatic otoscopy is directed as follows: Clinicians should obtain tympanometry in children with suspected OME for whom the diagnosis is uncertain after performing (or attempting) pneumatic otoscopy; this is a Strong recommendation based on extrapolation of systematic reviews of diagnostic studies with a preponderance of benefit over harm. Aggregate evidence quality is stated as Grade B with extrapolation from cross-sectional studies using a consistent reference standard for tympanometry as a primary diagnostic method, and the level of confidence in evidence is high for primary diagnosis and medium for use as an adjunct to pneumatic otoscopy. Benefits include improved diagnostic accuracy, confirmation of suspected OME, objective information regarding middle ear status, differentiation of OME versus tympanic membrane perforation by ear canal volume, and prognostic information, whereas risks, harms, and costs include cost, lack of access, equipment calibration and maintenance, and misinterpretation of findings; the benefit–harm assessment is a preponderance of benefit.

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^116yKq2Q]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis externa (AOE) with suspected or confirmed tympanic membrane perforation — topical agent selection and ototoxicity cautions are specified as follows: If the tympanic membrane is known or suspected to be nonintact, topical drops that contain alcohol, have a low pH (most acidifying/antiseptic agents), or both should be avoided because of pain and potential ototoxicity, and substances with ototoxic potential (eg, aminoglycosides, alcohol) should not be used when the tympanic membrane is perforated and the middle ear space is open, because the risk of ototoxic injury outweighs the benefits compared with non-ototoxic antimicrobials with equal efficacy; the only topical antimicrobials approved by the FDA (December 2005) for middle ear use are quinolone drops; warnings for neomycin-containing products note that neomycin can induce permanent sensorineural hearing loss, therapy should be limited to 10 consecutive days, and CORTISPORIN Otic Suspension should not be used in any patient with a perforated tympanic membrane; identification of persistent patency is aided by the facts that children with tubes inserted more than 1 year ago should also have the tympanic membrane carefully assessed, since in some cases the tube may remain functional for 3 years or longer, and individuals who taste substances placed into their ear or who can expel air out of their ear canal by pinched nose blowing can be assumed to have a perforation.

### Clinical practice guideline: otitis media with effusion (update) [^114KbQJ2]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2016). Medium credibility.

Otitis media with effusion (OME) frequently asked questions — ear fluid is described as "a buildup of mucus or liquid behind the eardrum, without symptoms of an ear infection", and ear infections (acute otitis media [AOM]) "cause fever, ear pain, and active (acute) inflammation"; in OME the fluid "is not actively infected, and pain may be absent or minimal". The page notes that "Nearly all children get ear fluid at least once by school age". Children may have "no symptoms at all or more subtle findings", and clinicians can detect fluid "by looking in the ear canal (otoscopy) or by measuring the movement of the eardrum (tympanometry or pneumatic otoscopy)". Causes listed include "a cold, an ear infection (AOM), or the normal congestion (negative pressure)", and most fluid "goes away on its own in weeks or months". OME "is of more concern if it lasts > 3 mo", and "Your doctor should check the ears periodically until the fluid is gone"; management advice notes that the "best advice can be found in clinical practice guidelines" based on evidence and consideration of benefits and harms.

### Otologic, audiometric and speech findings in patients undergoing surgery for cleft palate [^115kff1X]. BMC Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Cholesteatoma appears in studies as a complication of ventilation tube insertion, especially after insertion of T-tubes. The relationship between COM and cholesteatoma is clear in CP patients, with rates ranging from 0.90 to 9.20% for cholesteatoma. In our case, the frequency of cholesteatomatous COM was 2.06% as it was only observed in 5 patients with this type of pathology. The incidence of COM in this type of patients is variable (11–37%). Persistent tympanic perforation (1.30–19%), tympanic retraction (11.50–36.80%), tympanic sclerosis (11–37%), secondary cholesteatoma (0–3.80%) and otorrhea (up to 11.50%) present with great variability based on the revised study. In our study, we exclusively focused on membrane changes, such as retraction and 'pexia', that could be considered to be risk factors for the possible progression to COM when tympanosclerosis is not considered to be an abnormal appearance of the tympanic membrane.

### Clinical practice guideline: tympanostomy tubes in children (update) [^112o8X3F]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Tympanostomy tubes in children — ventilation duration, device types, and when to consider long-term tubes: Short-term tubes usually afford 8 to 18 months of middle ear ventilation, with Shepard usually extruding by 8 months; commonly used long-term tubes typically remain in place for 2 years or longer, and subannular ventilation tubes achieve long-term ventilation with median 35 months. The main benefit of T-tubes is prolonged ventilation but they are accompanied by increased risk of perforation, myringosclerosis, granulation tissue, cholesteatoma, and chronic otorrhea. About 25% of children need a second set of short-term tympanostomy tubes and about 8% require a third set, with additional risk factors for repeat surgery including having a parent who is a smoker, daycare attendance, breastfeeding for under 3 months, pacifier use, tympanic membrane atelectasis, male sex, asthma, gastrointestinal disease, and prematurity; however, there are no prospective studies to identify specific risk factors that identify children who would benefit from initial long-term tube placement. Consideration for placement of long-term tympanostomy tubes may be reserved for a subset with conditions such as cleft palate, Trisomy 21, or stenotic ear canals that make short-term tube placement difficult or impossible; other relative indications include an atrophic or atelectatic tympanic membrane or a history of premature extrusion of at least 2 sets of prior short-term tubes, and less often family preference to avoid multiple exposures to general anesthesia.

Acute TTO — indications for systemic antibiotics and management of failures: Systemic antibiotic therapy is not recommended for first-line therapy of uncomplicated acute TTO but is appropriate, with or without concurrent topical antibiotic therapy, when 1) Cellulitis of the pinna or adjacent skin is present, 2) Concurrent bacterial infection is present (eg, sinusitis, pneumonia, or streptococcal pharyngitis), 3) Signs of severe infection exist (high fever, severe otalgia, toxic appearance), 4) Acute TTO persists or worsens despite topical antibiotic therapy, 5) Administration of eardrops is not possible because of local discomfort or lack of tolerance by the child, 6) A patient has an immune-compromised state, or 7) Cost considerations prevent access to nontoxic topical antibiotic drops; children who fail topical therapy may need canal cleaning or tube lumen suctioning, topical drop concentrations at the site of infection can be up to 1000 times higher than serum-based thresholds used for resistance, About 4% to 8% of children on topical quinolone drops require additional antibiotic rescue therapy, and ear wicks have been described to manage refractory cases in 1 small case series.

Tympanostomy tubes — short-term versus long-term devices differ in duration, indications, and trade-offs. Short-term tubes ventilate for "8 to 18 months, on average; some stay in place 3 years or longer", are the "Routine choice for first ear tube surgery for a child", have "Reduced incidence (vs long-term tubes) of perforation, chronic otorrhea, granulation tissue, myringosclerosis; ease of insertion", but carry "Potential for early extrusion and need for repeat tube surgery". Long-term tubes provide ventilation for "15 months or longer, usually 2 to 3 years; some stay in place 5 years or longer", are a "Selective choice for first ear tube surgery for a child when a need for prolonged ventilation is anticipated; option for repeat tube surgery", offer "Longer period of middle ear ventilation, potential to avoid repeat insertion of short-term tubes and exposure to general anesthesia; ability to insert silastic T-tube in stenotic canal", but have "Increased incidence (vs short-term tube) of perforation, chronic otorrhea, granulation tissue, myringosclerosis, medialization (if short shaft with no outer flange); more difficult to insert". Relative uses include, for short-term tubes, "Repeat ear tube surgery in children without significant risk factors or anatomic changes in the eardrum that would warrant a long-term tube", and for long-term tubes, "Cleft palate, stenotic ear canal, abnormal tympanic membrane (atrophy, atelectasis, retraction pocket), premature extrusion of multiple prior short-term tubes".

### Giant' staghorn' rhinolith in a 15-year-old girl [^116WjKQx]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Rhinolith is not very common; incidence reported as 1 in 10 000 ENT outpatients in one of the studies. It literally can be translated as 'stone of the nose'. It is not a foreign body per se as it is not introduced from outside but it develops inside the nasal cavity by continuous, slow, layer-by-layer deposition of calcium and magnesium salts present in the nasal secretions over a nidus. This process takes years to develop.

The nidus may be endogenous or exogenous. Endogenous nidus means something that belongs to the body itself like thick inspissated mucus or a piece of mucus membrane or bone fragment. Exogenous nidus is always a foreign body like a piece of paper or tissue or a seed introduced into the nasal cavity. This is usually seen in small children or those who are mentally challenged.

### Clinical practice guideline: tympanostomy tubes in children (update) [^1126XHCh]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Table 1 — abbreviations and definitions of common terms — defines tympanostomy tube insertion, otitis media categories, and related ear findings with explicit thresholds. Tympanostomy tube insertion is surgical placement through a myringotomy for temporary middle ear ventilation, and tubes generally last several months to several years, with synonyms including ventilation tubes, pressure equalization (PE) tubes, grommets (UK), and bilateral myringotomy and tubes (BMT). Chronic otitis media with effusion (OME) is OME persisting for 3 months or longer from onset or diagnosis. Persistent acute otitis media (AOM) includes relapse of AOM within 1 month after completing antibiotics, and when 2 episodes of otitis media occur within 1 month it may be difficult to distinguish recurrence from persistence. AOM is the rapid onset of middle-ear inflammation diagnosed by a distinctly bulging tympanic membrane with a middle ear effusion; OME is fluid in the middle ear without signs or symptoms of AOM, and middle ear effusion (MEE) refers to fluid in the middle ear often from OME and during or after AOM. Tympanostomy tube otorrhea is discharge from the middle ear through the tube, a retraction pocket is a collapsed area of the tympanic membrane with sharp demarcation, and a tympanogram is an objective measure of tympanic membrane vibration and pressure, with a flat tracing if the middle ear is filled with fluid and a peak shifted based on pressure (left if negative, right if positive).

Tympanometry as an adjunct to pneumatic otoscopy — indications for use. Tympanometry is a useful adjunct to pneumatic otoscopy because it provides objective evidence of middle ear status, and although recommended as a first-line diagnostic test for OME, pneumatic otoscopy has varying degrees of validity and accuracy in routine clinical practice; all studies examining test performance of pneumatic otoscopy have used experienced otoscopists with special training, validation, or both, whereas OME is most often diagnosed by primary care providers who are not validated and do not often use a pneumatic attachment. There are no specific studies that validate the performance characteristics of tympanometry as a confirmatory, or adjunctive, test with pneumatic otoscopy, and we therefore recommend tympanometry when the diagnosis of OME is uncertain after pneumatic otoscopy is used or attempted; specific situations for which tympanometry is recommended include child intolerance of pneumatic otoscopy; inability to reliably perform pneumatic otoscopy because of training or equipment considerations (eg, inability to obtain an air-tight seal); difficulty visualizing the tympanic membrane because of partially obstructing cerumen that cannot be readily removed by the clinician; difficulty visualizing the tympanic membrane because of a very narrow or stenotic external auditory canal (eg, Down syndrome); uncertainty about the presence or absence of OME because of equivocal findings on pneumatic otoscopy; need or desire to rule out OME in an at-risk (Table 3) child; and need or desire for objective confirmation of OME before surgery.

### Tympanic membrane abnormalities and hearing levels at the ages of 5 and 6 years in relation to persistent otitis media and tympanostomy tube insertion in the first 3 years of life: a prospective study incorporating a randomized clinical trial [^112TvtgB]. Pediatrics (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

One current practice guideline recommends myringotomy with tympanostomy tube insertion (M&T) for young children in whom middle-ear effusion (MEE) has persisted for 3 months, and another recommends the procedure after MEE has persisted for 4 to 6 months provided that a bilateral hearing loss of ≥ 20 dB is present. Sequelae of M&T are not uncommon, but the extent to which these sequelae are attributable to M&T itself or to the middle-ear disease that prompted the procedure or to both has not been clear. Our objective in the present study was to examine the prevalence of various tympanic membrane (TM) abnormalities in otherwise healthy children at the age of 5 years and hearing levels at the age of 6 years in relation to persistent MEE and M&T in the children's first 3 years of life.

Methods

In a prospective study of child development in relation to early-life otitis media, we randomly assigned 429 children who met specified criteria regarding the persistence of MEE in their first 3 years of life to undergo M&T either promptly (the "early-treatment" group) or after a defined extended period if MEE remained present (the "late-treatment" group). We also followed a representative sample of 241 children who ranged from having no MEE to having MEE whose cumulative duration fell just short of meeting randomization criteria for the clinical trial (the "nontrial" group). Most of the children in each group underwent both otomicroscopic examination at the age of 5 years and audiometric testing at the age of 6 years, at times when they were free of MEE. Among these children, M&T had been performed in 82.3% of those in the early-treatment group, 38.1% of those in the late-treatment group, and 3.0% of those in the nontrial group.

Results

At the age of 5 years, we found 1 or more types of TM abnormality in 1 or both ears in 70.7%, 42.5%, and 9.5% of the children in the early-treatment, late-treatment, and nontrial groups, respectively. Within the 3 groups, however, among children who received tubes, the proportions who had an abnormality of some type were similar, namely, 82.6%, 80.4%, and 83.3%, respectively. The corresponding proportions among children who had not received tubes were 15.4%, 19.3%, and 7.2%, respectively. Segmental atrophy and tympanosclerosis were the most common abnormalities found. At the age of 6 years, mean pure-tone average audiometric thresholds in the early-treatment, late-treatment, and nontrial groups, respectively, were 6.18 dB, 5.49 dB, and 4.63 dB in left ears and 6.17 dB, 6.02 dB, and 4.32 dB in right ears. The thresholds in the early- and late-treatment groups did not differ significantly, but the thresholds in the early- and late-treatment groups were each significantly higher than in the nontrial group. Within the early- and late-treatment groups, we found no significant relation between hearing levels and the presence or type of TM abnormalities.

Conclusion

In otherwise healthy children who have persistent MEE during their first 3 years of life, ready resort to M&T results in far more TM abnormalities at age 5 than does selective management in which most children do not receive the procedure. With these differing approaches, however, hearing levels at age 6 do not differ. Regardless of whether children with persistent early-life MEE receive M&T, they have more TM abnormalities at age 5 and negligibly poorer hearing at age 6 than do children who had less or no otitis media. Longer term otologic and audiologic outcomes of persistent early-life MEE and of M&T remain to be determined. In view of 1) the present findings and the remaining uncertainties concerning sequelae, 2) the fact that M&T involves certain immediate risks — albeit minimal — and substantial cost, and 3) previously reported findings in the study's randomized clinical trial that show no developmental advantage at ages 3 and 4 years accruing from children's having received prompt M&T, a prolonged period of watchful waiting seems desirable in otherwise healthy children who are younger than 3 years and have persistent, asymptomatic MEE that is not complicated by sensorineural or severe conductive hearing loss, balance dysfunction, or severe TM retraction.

Tympanometry — procedure and interpretation include how the test records middle ear function and recognized tracing types. Tympanometry provides an objective assessment of tympanic membrane mobility, eustachian tube function, and middle ear function by measuring the amount of sound energy reflected back when a small probe is placed in the ear canal, and a tympanogram is a graph of energy admitted to the tympanic membrane and middle ear as air pressure in the ear canal is varied from negative to positive and recorded graphically. Tympanometric tracings are classified into 3 main types, including type A with low probability of effusion, and a normal, type A Tympanogram has a height that varies but is normal within the 2 stacked rectangles; Ad indicates an abnormally flexible tympanic membrane, As indicates an abnormally stiff tympanic membrane, and a well-defined peak makes the likelihood of effusion low.

Case Presentation

A 15-year-old boy presented with three acute episodes of self-limited hemoptysis. He was being followed by the pediatric pulmonology department for necrotizing pneumonia and a right upper lobe lung abscess with residual pneumatocele 5 years earlier. He had also experienced recurrent perianal abscesses and more than 15 acute suppurative otitis media throughout his life, even after myringotomy and transtympanic drainage; methicillin-sensitive Staphyloccocus aureus was found in a culture of otic exudate. He had no known allergies and was not taking any drugs. The patient's father had presented with more than 20 skin abscesses and was carrier of methicillin-resistant S aureus. After necrotizing pneumonia and along with his family history, the patient had undergone a neutrophil oxidative burst test excluding chronic granulomatous disease; immunoglobulin levels and lymphocyte populations were within normal range.

### Tympanic membrane changes in central tympanic membrane perforations [^116QmoBb]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose

The objective of this study was to evaluate the histopathological changes in central tympanic membrane perforations caused by chronic otitis media without cholesteatoma.

Materials and Methods

Twenty-nine temporal bones from 25 patients (13 male patients and 12 female patients) with central tympanic membrane perforations-18 chronic otitis media with perforation and 11 chronic otitis media with perforation caused by ventilation tubes-and 30 aged-matched normal temporal bones were included in this study. A scale was used to evaluate the extension of the migration of stratified squamous epithelium in the inner surface of the tympanic membrane. The thickness of tympanic membranes was measured halfway between the annular ligament and the perforation and compared with that of the normal bones. The presence of tympanosclerosis and papillary projections of squamous epithelium was also noted.

Results

The extension of the migration of stratified squamous epithelium in the inner surface of the tympanic membrane was observed in 11 of the 29 perforations (38%). The thickness of tympanic membranes was significantly different between the perforation groups and the control group. Of the 29 tympanic membranes, 13 (44%) had tympanosclerosis and 8 (28%) revealed papillary projections of squamous epithelium.

Conclusions

Our study shows that a central tympanic perforation should not merely be considered as a simple defect. Most of the tympanic membranes showed one or more signs of sequelae or persistent abnormalities such as tympanosclerosis, papillary projections, thickening, and ingrowth without significant differences between the 2 central perforation groups.

### Fibrosis within the tympanic membrane [^112iKLKw]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

A primary mass lesion arising from the tympanic membrane is extremely rare. The authors report a patient of extensive fibrosis within the tympanic membrane in a 65-year-old woman who did not have a history of ear infection. The patient complained of slow progressing hearing loss on the left side without otorrhea or otalgia. Otoscopic examination showed a thick tympanic membrane with whitish mass-like bulge, and pure-tone audiometry revealed conductive hearing loss. The lesion was totally resected, and final findings of a histopathologic examination revealed extensive fibrosis with subsiding inflammation within the tympanic membrane. Fibrosis within the tympanic membrane may present with slow progressing conductive hearing loss and should be considered a possible differential diagnosis of mass lesions in the tympanic membrane.

### External auditory canal sebaceous carcinoma [^1132zP5D]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

Background

Sebaceous glands are very dense in the area proximal to hair follicles in the head and neck region. Although some mitotic activity is expected to be found in sebaceous glands' cells, the transformation to sebaceous carcinoma (SC) is very rare.SC accounts for 0.7% of skin malignancy, and it arises from the sebaceous glands' adnexal epithelium.SC was introduced as a separate entity for the first time in 1956 by Straatsma. The pathogenesis of SC remains unexplained by previous studies; however, a few known associated risk factors, such as old age, have been reported; in fact, it has been referred to as a 'malignancy of the elderly'. Other risk factors, such as exposure to radiation and immunosuppression, have also been described. Additionally, any patient diagnosed with SC must be referred to exclude the possibility of a coexistent autosomal dominant skin condition, the Muir-Torre syndrome, which is characterised by sebaceous neoplasms and internal malignancies. Patients with the Muir-Torre syndrome were reported to have a far less aggressive and earlier presentation of SCs when compared with the de novo SCs course. In these cases, 75% of the SCs are usually found in the periocular area with only 25% diagnosed in an extraocular site at which they are mostly found in the skin of the head and neck or other areas with hair follicles. Photodamage and associated DNA damage were hypothesised to be the reason behind such proclivity to the head and neck region in addition to the higher density of sebaceous glands in the head and neck. The external auditory canal (EAC) extends from the concha laterally to the tympanic membrane medially, and this canal is divided into a cartilaginous outer one-third area and an inner bony two-thirds. Both are lined with stratified squamous epithelium, however, only the outer one-third contains dermal adnexa which can be the origin of sebaceous gland carcinoma. The incidence of SC in the outer one-third of the EAC is considered extremely rare. A recent study reported that less than 15 cases of EAC sebaceous neoplasms are currently available in the literature. However, a comprehensive review of the available literature revealed that only eight case reports of SC originating in the EAC are available, which emphasises the importance of having a high index of suspicion in such cases. This extremely rare carcinoma can lead to misdiagnosis of this condition as an inflammatory one, which can lead to delayed management and an increase in mortality.

### Fungal otitis externa as a cause of tympanic membrane perforation: a case series [^111iLiLK]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2014). Low credibility.

We describe a series of 11 patients — 8 men and 3 women, aged 18 to 70 years (mean: 46.0) — who had fungal otitis externa that had been complicated by a tympanic membrane perforation. These patients had been referred to us for evaluation of chronic, mostly treatment-refractory otitis externa, which had manifested as otorrhea, otalgia, and/or pruritus. Seven of the 11 patients had no history of ear problems prior to their current condition. Five patients had been referred to us by a primary care physician and 4 by an otolaryngologist; the other 2 patients were self-referred. All patients were treated with a thorough debridement of the ear and one of two antifungal medication regimens. Eight of the 11 patients experienced a complete resolution of signs and symptoms, including closure of the tympanic membrane perforation. The other 3 patients underwent either a tympanoplasty (n = 2) or a fat-graft myringotomy (n = 1) because the perforation did not close within a reasonable amount of time. This series demonstrates that the nonspecific signs and symptoms of fungal otitis externa can make diagnosis difficult for both primary care physicians and general otolaryngologists. This study also demonstrates that most cases of tympanic membrane perforation secondary to fungal otitis externa will resolve with cleaning of the ear and proper medical treatment. Therefore, most patients with this condition will not require surgery.

### Beyond the otoscope: an imaging review of congenital cholesteatoma [^115kXJmi]. Insights Into Imaging (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cholesteatoma is defined by the European Academy of Otology and Neurotology and the Japanese Otological Society as a mass formed by the keratinizing squamous epithelium in the tympanic cavity and/or mastoid and subepithelial connective tissue and by the progressive accumulation of keratin debris with or without a surrounding inflammatory reaction. They are histologically almost identical to the epidermoid cysts found in the cerebellopontine angle and the epidermoid inclusion cysts found in the skin. Cholesteatomas can be subdivided into two broad categories: congenital and acquired. Opposed to acquired cholesteatoma (AC), congenital cholesteatomas (CC) were thought to be very rare during the 19th and 20th centuries. In 1965 Derlacki and Clemis defined CC as a cholesteatoma that develops behind an intact tympanic membrane in a patient without a previous history of aural infections. It was later proposed that CC could not be excluded solely on grounds of prior bouts of otitis media and this definition is still in use today. CC can be further subdivided into congenital middle ear cholesteatoma (CMEC) and congenital petrous bone cholesteatoma (CPBC), the latter arising outside the tympanic cavity. It is important to recognize that there is some overlap between these two categories as the intratympanic lesions may show extratympanic extension and vice-versa. CMEC and CPBC share similar histologic and imaging characteristics and from a radiological perspective, it therefore seems logical to focus on all CCs arising within the temporal bone.

### Isolated incudostapedial cholesteatomas: unique radiologic and surgical features [^113svd1m]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Congenital cholesteatomas originate from epithelial tissue present within the middle ear in patients with an intact tympanic membrane, no history of otologic surgery, otorrhea, or tympanic membrane perforation. They are diagnosed by a pearl-like lesion on otoscopy and computed tomography (CT) scan showing an expansile soft-tissue mass. We describe a series of patients with no prior otologic history presenting with progressive unilateral conductive hearing loss and normal otoscopy. The CT scans showed ossicular erosion without obvious soft-tissue mass. Surgery confirmed incudostapedial erosion found to be cholesteatoma. In this study, we characterize the clinical course of patients diagnosed with isolated incudostapedial cholesteatoma (IIC) and review possible pathologic mechanisms.

Methods

Retrospective review of IIC cases treated by the Department of Pediatric Otolaryngology, Rady Children's Hospital, San Diego, 2014 to 2020. Data included patient demographics, clinical features, imaging, surgical findings, and audiologic data.

Results

Five patients were diagnosed with IIC (3 [60%] female; mean age at presentation 10.7 years [range 5.5–16.0]). All patients presented with postlingual unilateral conductive hearing loss and normal otoscopy without any past otologic history; delay in diagnosis ranged from 4 months to several years. The CT scans showed ossicular chain erosion with an absent long process of the incus and/or stapes superstructure. All patients underwent middle ear exploration, revealing a thin layer of cholesteatoma in the incudostapedial region, confirmed by histopathology. Mean preoperative speech reception threshold was 55 dB and improved to a mean of 31 dB in the 4 patients who underwent ossicular chain reconstruction.

Conclusion

Isolated incudostapedial cholesteatoma should be included as a possible etiology in pediatric patients with insidious onset of unilateral conductive hearing loss with normal otoscopy, unremarkable otologic history, and a CT scan showing ossicular abnormality/disruption without notable middle ear mass. These patients should be counseled preoperatively regarding the possibility of cholesteatoma and should undergo middle ear exploration with possible ossiculoplasty.

### Diagnosis of pediatric cholesteatoma [^116nEerj]. Pediatrics (2007). Low credibility.

Cholesteatomas are abnormal collections of squamous epithelium and keratin debris that usually involve the middle ear and mastoid. Although histologically benign, they have the ability to expand and destroy bone. Cholesteatomas are treated surgically. The success of such surgery is highly dependent on the extent of the lesion. This article presents information and images to aid the general pediatrician in the early recognition of cholesteatomas, both congenital and acquired, in hopes of improving the outcome for children with this treatable disorder.

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^116YVr5a]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis externa (AOE) — allergic reactions to otic preparations and management: Some otic preparations have been reported to cause sensitization, and neomycin is the most common substance, causing reactions in about 5% to 15% of patients with chronic external otitis. Patch testing has demonstrated that 13% of normal volunteers are hypersensitive to neomycin. Clinical findings can include a maculopapular and often eczematous eruption on the conchal bowl and in the ear canal with an erythematous rash that may extend down the pinna where drops contact the auricular skin. Management involves removing the sensitizing agent and applying a topical steroid or other anti-inflammatory topical; examples include tacrolimus 0.1% ointment or pimecrolimus 1% cream.

### The natural course of tympanic membrane retractions in the posterosuperior quadrant of pars tensa: a watchful waiting policy [^114iQriW]. Otology & Neurotology (2021). Medium credibility.

Furthermore, the ossicular chain damage was not systematically collected and was solely based on the descriptions in the medical records and, when the ossicular chain was clearly visible on the oto-endoscopic images. No classification system was used because the entire ossicular chain could not be visualized during otoscopy. Lastly, seven patients in our cohort received ventilation tubes after the wait-and-see policy was initiated. The indication for these ventilation tubes was OME and not for the TMR. These patients with ventilation tubes were not excluded due to the intention-to-treat principle. We have used this principle to mirror expected outcomes seen in real world practice. One excluded patient developed cholesteatoma during follow-up, this patient was excluded due to missing oto-endoscopic images. It was noted in the clinical records that this patient had a retraction and developed cholesteatoma.

Clinical Implications

Based on our data, a wait-and-see policy can be justified in patients with a pars tensa retraction, especially in patients who have mild hearing loss. However, caution should be taken in patients with a pars tensa retraction which involves the promontory (Sade grade III) at the first visit to the otorhinolaryngology clinic. The decision to operate a patient should be individually discussed and be based on the age of the patient, severity of the retraction, and the initial amount of hearing loss. A large prospective study is needed to confirm these results.

### Beyond the otoscope: an imaging review of congenital cholesteatoma [^112ktyfx]. Insights Into Imaging (2024). Medium credibility.

Clinical features

CMEC is rare, and its exact incidence and prevalence are unknown due to a significant number of asymptomatic cases and sometimes difficult differentiation between congenital and ACs. Originally believed to be even rarer, the incidence of CC has been increasing since the mid-90s. The incidence of CMEC was estimated at 0.12 per 100,000 (or roughly 1 every million) person-years according to one surgical study and about 1–5% of all middle ear cholesteatomas are of the congenital type. CMEC, just like acquired middle ear cholesteatoma, is more common in boys than girls with a ratio of 3:1 and the mean age at diagnosis is 6–7 years. Both ears are equally affected and bilateral CMEC is possible but very rare.

The classical presentation of a CMEC is that of a pearly white mass behind an intact tympanic membrane. The existing literature shows that 23–30% of patients have a history of inflammatory disease of the middle ear but in most patients, the inflammation is not a prominent feature. Conductive hearing loss is the major presenting symptom while sensorineural hearing loss, otalgia, facial nerve dysfunction, and tinnitus are less common.

Data on CPBC are rather limited. It is a rare disease and about 12–15% of all petrous bone cholesteatomas are of the congenital type. Mean age at diagnosis is higher for CPBC compared to CMEC, around 38–46 years. This later presentation may be due to the paucity of symptoms as well as the inability to detect most lesions on otoscopy. Just like CMEC there is no clear right-left predilection and bilateral lesions are very rare.

Mixed hearing loss is the major presenting symptom in CPBC. Facial nerve dysfunction is a fairly typical presentation most commonly seen in supralabyrinthine disease. Vertigo, otorrhea, and otalgia are less common. Other, rare complications include abscesses, labyrinthitis, sinus thrombophlebitis, and meningitis.

### Clinical practice guideline: otitis media with effusion (update) [^112YAxw6]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

This update of a 2004 guideline codeveloped by the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation, the American Academy of Pediatrics, and the American Academy of Family Physicians, provides evidence-based recommendations to manage otitis media with effusion (OME), defined as the presence of fluid in the middle ear without signs or symptoms of acute ear infection. Changes from the prior guideline include consumer advocates added to the update group, evidence from 4 new clinical practice guidelines, 20 new systematic reviews, and 49 randomized control trials, enhanced emphasis on patient education and shared decision making, a new algorithm to clarify action statement relationships, and new and expanded recommendations for the diagnosis and management of OME.

Purpose

The purpose of this multidisciplinary guideline is to identify quality improvement opportunities in managing OME and to create explicit and actionable recommendations to implement these opportunities in clinical practice. Specifically, the goals are to improve diagnostic accuracy, identify children who are most susceptible to developmental sequelae from OME, and educate clinicians and patients regarding the favorable natural history of most OME and the clinical benefits for medical therapy (eg, steroids, antihistamines, decongestants). Additional goals relate to OME surveillance, hearing and language evaluation, and management of OME detected by newborn screening. The target patient for the guideline is a child aged 2 months through 12 years with OME, with or without developmental disabilities or underlying conditions that predispose to OME and its sequelae. The guideline is intended for all clinicians who are likely to diagnose and manage children with OME, and it applies to any setting in which OME would be identified, monitored, or managed. This guideline, however, does not apply to patients < 2 months or > 12 years old.

Action Statements

The update group made strong recommendations that clinicians (1) should document the presence of middle ear effusion with pneumatic otoscopy when diagnosing OME in a child; (2) should perform pneumatic otoscopy to assess for OME in a child with otalgia, hearing loss, or both; (3) should obtain tympanometry in children with suspected OME for whom the diagnosis is uncertain after performing (or attempting) pneumatic otoscopy; (4) should manage the child with OME who is not at risk with watchful waiting for 3 months from the date of effusion onset (if known) or 3 months from the date of diagnosis (if onset is unknown); (5) should recommend against using intranasal or systemic steroids for treating OME; (6) should recommend against using systemic antibiotics for treating OME; and (7) should recommend against using antihistamines, decongestants, or both for treating OME. The update group made recommendations that clinicians (1) should document in the medical record counseling of parents of infants with OME who fail a newborn screening regarding the importance of follow-up to ensure that hearing is normal when OME resolves and to exclude an underlying sensorineural hearing loss; (2) should determine if a child with OME is at increased risk for speech, language, or learning problems from middle ear effusion because of baseline sensory, physical, cognitive, or behavioral factors; (3) should evaluate at-risk children for OME at the time of diagnosis of an at-risk condition and at 12 to 18 months of age (if diagnosed as being at risk prior to this time); (4) should not routinely screen children for OME who are not at risk and do not have symptoms that may be attributable to OME, such as hearing difficulties, balance (vestibular) problems, poor school performance, behavioral problems, or ear discomfort; (5) should educate children with OME and their families regarding the natural history of OME, need for follow-up, and the possible sequelae; (6) should obtain an age-appropriate hearing test if OME persists for 3 months or longer OR for OME of any duration in an at-risk child; (7) should counsel families of children with bilateral OME and documented hearing loss about the potential impact on speech and language development; (8) should reevaluate, at 3- to 6-month intervals, children with chronic OME until the effusion is no longer present, significant hearing loss is identified, or structural abnormalities of the eardrum or middle ear are suspected; (9) should recommend tympanostomy tubes when surgery is performed for OME in a child < 4 years old; adenoidectomy should not be performed unless a distinct indication exists (nasal obstruction, chronic adenoiditis); (10) should recommend tympanostomy tubes, adenoidectomy, or both when surgery is performed for OME in a child ≥ 4 years old; and (11) should document resolution of OME, improved hearing, or improved quality of life when managing a child with OME.

### Developmental genetic bases behind the independent origin of the tympanic membrane in mammals and diapsids [^113x6Cyv]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

The amniote middle ear is a classical example of the evolutionary novelty. Although paleontological evidence supports the view that mammals and diapsids (modern reptiles and birds) independently acquired the middle ear after divergence from their common ancestor, the developmental bases of these transformations remain unknown. Here we show that lower-to-upper jaw transformation induced by inactivation of the Endothelin1-Dlx5/6 cascade involving Goosecoid results in loss of the tympanic membrane in mouse, but causes duplication of the tympanic membrane in chicken. Detailed anatomical analysis indicates that the relative positions of the primary jaw joint and first pharyngeal pouch led to the coupling of tympanic membrane formation with the lower jaw in mammals, but with the upper jaw in diapsids. We propose that differences in connection and release by various pharyngeal skeletal elements resulted in structural diversity, leading to the acquisition of the tympanic membrane in two distinct manners during amniote evolution.

Otitis media with effusion — tympanometry preparation and calibration. Prior to performing tympanometry, the ear canal should be examined with otoscopy for cerumen blockage, foreign bodies, drainage, tympanic membrane perforation, or a collapsed canal to correlate findings with tympanometry results. Proper calibration of the tympanometer is essential for accurate results.

### Clinical practice guideline: otitis media with effusion (update) [^112uYFSv]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2016). Medium credibility.

Otitis media with effusion — natural history supports observation: "OME occurring after an episode of AOM resolves in 75% to 90% of cases by the third month". Among newly diagnosed OME with a type B tympanogram, "56 will improve… by 3 months; 72 will have improved at 6 months; and 87 will no longer have a flat tracing at 12 months", whereas with chronic OME, "19 will resolve by 3 months, 25 by 6 months, 31 by 12 months, and 33… by 24 months". A type B tympanogram is "an imperfect measure of OME (81% to 94% sensitivity and 74% to 94% specificity vs myringotomy)". The guideline notes "The recommendation for a 3-month period of observation is based on a clear preponderance of benefit over harm".

### Clinical practice guideline (update): earwax (cerumen impaction) [^1123jHZ8]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Cerumen impaction — precautions for removal and irrigation highlight safety considerations and technique selection. The suspicion of a nonintact tympanic membrane should be assessed by history and/or physical examination prior to selection of a disimpaction technique, and prior tympanic membrane perforation, prior ear surgery, intratympanic injections, tympanostomy tubes, or barotrauma should prompt use of techniques other than irrigation. Current otitis externa should also be identified; if the ear canal is currently infected, irrigation should be avoided. Pain should alert clinicians to possible infection or other pathology, and if present the ear should be assessed before selecting a method of cleaning. In the presence of a perforated tympanic membrane, irrigation could produce caloric effects resulting in vertigo, some agents can be toxic to the middle or inner ear, and mechanical removal is the preferred technique when eardrum perforation is suspected. Safe and effective irrigation is not always possible in patients with narrow or stenotic ear canals, and specialized equipment and procedures may be required to safely remove cerumen in these patients. A perforated tympanic membrane or patent tympanostomy tube likewise limits options available for cerumen removal.

### Adenoid hypertrophy in children: a narrative review of pathogenesis and clinical relevance [^11437RZ8]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2023). High credibility.

Otitis media with effusion

OME is defined as a condition where fluid in the tympanic cavity accumulates when there are no features of acute otitis media present. It occurs while the continuity of the eardrum membrane is preserved. Local inflammation leads to metaplasia of the epithelium lining the tympanic cavity and to an accumulation of fluid within the middle ear. The exudate is mucinous or serous-mucous. Persistent OME refers to a situation when symptoms last for at least 3 months.OME may be asymptomatic, or patients may experience various forms of ear discomfort, hearing loss, tinnitus, dizziness or a feeling of fullness in the ear. The otoscopic picture may vary depending on the nature and duration that the fluid is present. Its most common symptoms are a thickening of the eardrum with a yellowish or amber tint, or bruising to the eardrum with a bright white colouration. Persistent ear effusion leads to permanent changes in the tympanic membrane structure which intensify due to being exposed to prolonged negative pressure. Untreated exudate may lead to irreversible consequences, such as calcification and/or atelectasis of the tympanic membrane, the formation of retraction pockets, tympanosclerosis and cholesteatoma. Permanent conductive hearing loss, which may occur due to the presence of middle ear fluid, usually leads to delayed or impaired speech development, communication difficulties, limited vocabulary, disturbances in attention and lower academic performance.

The pathophysiology of OME in children is complex. It includes specific host, environmental, genetic and social risk factors. The relatively higher prevalence of OME in children compared with adults is thought to be related to the immaturity of the eustachian tube (ET). The eustachian tube is shorter and more horizontal in children. Additionally, its cartilage is more dense with less elastin in children compared with adults. Moreover, the mucosal lining of the children's ET is thicker and more folded. Also, lymphoid tissue aggregation that built the tubal tonsil is more developed in children. Bacteria accumulating in the nasal cavity explains the increased risk of ear infections, nevertheless, conventional microbiological tests on middle ear exudates do not always show bacterial growth. The sensitivity of bacterial detection in middle ear infections has been improved thanks to the introduction of the PCR technique. This method is useful in detecting slowly growing pathogens that are difficult to culture in a diagnostic lab.

### The natural course of tympanic membrane retractions in the posterosuperior quadrant of pars tensa: a watchful waiting policy [^117VDQXd]. Otology & Neurotology (2021). Medium credibility.

The first staging system of TMRs was proposed by Sade and Berco in 1976, classifying pars tensa retraction by otoscopic image into stage I till IV, based on the reversibility of the retraction after ventilation. Since then, various authors have proposed other staging systems for which there is no common agreement regarding its clinical utility. Recent studies have shown that these staging systems do not or weakly correlate to clinical outcomes.

Clinically, pars tensa retractions remain stable in the majority of cases without producing any symptoms, and spontaneous recovery occurs in approximately 40% of mild (Sade classification I) cases. However, when pars tensa retractions become more severe and progressive, they may lead to hearing loss, perforations of the tympanic membrane, erosion of the ossicular chain, and even cholesteatoma. In about 15% of mild cases, TMRs progress into a precholesteatomatous stage (formation of microcholesteatomas in the lamina propria), with around 4% of cases developing to cholesteatoma. Therefore, correct diagnosis and proper management of pars tensa retractions are essential to prevent middle ear cholesteatoma.

Various management strategies of pars tensa retractions have been proposed and include a wait-and-see policy, ventilation tubes, or tympanoplasty. Clinical outcomes of the wait-and-see policy are lacking in the literature, especially for adults. Therefore, our aim was to investigate the natural course of pars tensa retractions in a large cohort of patients in which a wait-and see policy was initiated.

### The etiology and clinical course of bullous myringitis… [^11652Qfp]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

BULLOUS myringitis is a common condition characterized by vesicular eruptions of the tympanic membrane. In the majority of cases the condition is self-limited, although serious complications have been reported. 1–3 The disease is primarily one of childhood, but is frequently seen in adults. Bullous myringitis is generally thought to be of viral origin, although several investigations have failed to establish this. 2, 4, 5 Recent studies suggest a relationship to influenza virus6 and the Eaton agent, 7–9 a pleuropneumonia-like organism known to be capable of producing primary atypical pneumonia. It is the purpose of this report to consider these and other possible causative agents in a prospective study of 23 cases of bullous myringitis. Historical Review A detailed review of the subject can be found in a previous publication. 3 In brief, the symptom complex was apparently first recognized during the pandemics at the turn of the century. 10 MERIFIELD DO, MILLER GS.
