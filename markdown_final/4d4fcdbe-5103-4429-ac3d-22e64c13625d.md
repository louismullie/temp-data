## Question

How long does methamphetamine stay detectable in urine for

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how long methamphetamine stays detectable in urine and what factors influence that window. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacokinetics and half-life of methamphetamine. Then, I should verify how urine pH affects excretion and detection. Next, I will distinguish detection windows for single use versus chronic use. After that, I need to check how different assay types and cutoffs modify detection. Finally, I will synthesize a practical clinical answer and note limitations and exceptions that could extend or shorten the window.

> Let me first confirm the pharmacokinetic basics. Methamphetamine is eliminated primarily unchanged in urine and as metabolites, with a reported biological half-life around 4 to 5 hours in therapeutic contexts, though this can be longer with supratherapeutic or illicit exposures, and the active metabolite amphetamine has a longer half-life of roughly 9 to 12 hours, which contributes to prolonged detection in some settings [^116x6cxs] [^117GWrPY] [^112Peten].

> Wait, let me verify the urine pH effect because it is easy to underappreciate. Methamphetamine is a weak base, so alkaline urine increases its half-life and extends detection, whereas acidifying urine shortens it. This is clinically important and is why agents that alter urinary pH can meaningfully change exposure and detection windows, and why hydration status and diet can modulate results [^116x6cxs] [^112ATx2J].

> I will now examine the detection window for single or occasional use. For most drugs, including stimulants, urine detection typically spans 1 to 3 days after a single dose, and for methamphetamine specifically, federal workplace tables list a 3 to 4 day window, which aligns with clinical addiction medicine guidance that most substances are detectable 1 to 3 days, with some extending to 4 days depending on fluid intake and urine pH [^114Nv9tv] [^112ATx2J] [^113sCJbH].

> Hold on, I should verify the window for chronic or heavy use because accumulation can occur. With repeated dosing, methamphetamine can be sequestered in peripheral tissues and demonstrate extended urinary clearance, and clinical reviews note that stimulants may be detectable longer with long-term use, with some sources citing up to a week or more in heavy users. This is consistent with observations that chronic exposure increases urinary concentrations and detection duration [^111r4CS1] [^114SagWS] [^1132bmmy].

> Next, I should review how assay methodology changes interpretation. Immunoassay screening is rapid but prone to false positives from cross-reactivity with decongestants, bupropion, trazodone, and others, and it may miss low-level or recent use. Confirmatory LC-MS/MS is more specific and sensitive, and clinicians should confirm unexpected positives and consider false positives when the history does not fit, especially in acute care where time delays limit utility [^116KYSR4] [^114gRZjF] [^112HBtaX].

> Let me consider practical clinical implications and edge cases. A negative urine test does not exclude use within the prior 24 to 48 hours, especially if the sample is dilute or the immunoassay cutoff is high, and sample tampering can further confound results. Thus, timing of collection, observed sampling, and confirmatory testing matter, and in suspected poisoning with initially negative screens, repeating testing or using definitive methods can reveal clinically significant levels as they rise above cutoffs [^112ATx2J] [^111y3x5j].

> Putting this together, I should double-check my synthesis. For a single, low-to-moderate dose of methamphetamine, expect urine detection for about 3 to 4 days in most people, with the lower end closer to 2 to 3 days in those with acidic urine and good hydration, and the upper end extending toward 4 to 7 days with alkaline urine or higher doses. With chronic or heavy use, detection can extend beyond a week due to accumulation and prolonged clearance, so a conservative estimate is 1 week or more in heavy users, acknowledging that definitive LC-MS/MS testing and clinical context refine interpretation [^114Nv9tv] [^112ATx2J] [^111r4CS1] [^1132bmmy].

---

Methamphetamine is typically detectable in urine for **1–4 days** after single use, with chronic or heavy use extending the window to **up to 7–10 days**. Detection depends on dose, frequency, metabolism, hydration, and urine pH; alkaline urine prolongs detection, while acidic urine shortens it. Immunoassay screens are rapid but prone to false positives; **confirmatory LC-MS/MS** is required for accurate results. Clinical interpretation should consider patient history, medications, and the assay used [^114Nv9tv] [^112ATx2J] [^116x6cxs] [^112XNM8V] [^117GWrPY].

---

## Pharmacokinetics and metabolism

Methamphetamine is rapidly absorbed and metabolized in the liver, producing active metabolites such as amphetamine. The parent drug and metabolites are excreted primarily in urine, with excretion influenced by urine pH and hydration status [^116x6cxs]. The **biological half-life** is approximately 4–5 hours, but this can vary with urine pH and individual metabolism [^116x6cxs].

---

## Detection windows in urine

The detection window for methamphetamine in urine varies with **use patterns and individual factors**:

| **Use pattern** | **Typical detection window** |
|-|-|
| Single use | 1–4 days |
| Chronic or heavy use | Up to 7–10 days |
| High-dose or prolonged use | Up to 10 days or more |

---

These ranges reflect typical clinical experience and laboratory data [^114Nv9tv]; **individual results may vary** based on metabolism, hydration, and urine pH [^112ATx2J] [^111Efv6v].

---

## Factors influencing detection time

Several factors influence how long methamphetamine remains detectable in urine:

- **Dose and frequency**: Higher doses and frequent use increase detection time due to accumulation in the body [^111r4CS1].
- **Metabolism**: Individual metabolic rates significantly affect clearance; faster metabolism shortens detection time.
- **Hydration**: Diluted urine may reduce detectable concentrations, potentially leading to false negatives if below assay cutoffs [^112ATx2J].
- **Urine pH**: Alkaline urine prolongs detection by increasing drug half-life; acidic urine shortens it [^116x6cxs].
- **Body mass and fat content**: Higher fat content may prolong detection due to drug sequestration in fatty tissues [^notfound].

---

## Testing methods and their accuracy

Urine drug testing for methamphetamine typically uses **immunoassay screening** followed by confirmatory testing:

- **Immunoassay screening**: Rapid and widely used, but prone to false positives from cross-reactivity with other medications (e.g. pseudoephedrine, bupropion, trazodone) [^112dnNtD] [^117GWrPY].
- **Confirmatory testing**: Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) or liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) provides high specificity and accuracy, confirming methamphetamine presence and quantifying levels [^114gRZjF] [^111Efv6v].

---

## Clinical implications and interpretation

Clinicians should interpret urine test results within the **clinical context**, considering patient history, medications, and testing methodology. False positives can occur due to cross-reactivity, and confirmatory testing is essential for accurate diagnosis [^116KYSR4]. Urine drug testing is a valuable tool for monitoring substance use, guiding treatment, and informing clinical decisions, but results must be interpreted cautiously and in conjunction with clinical judgment [^1169FZun].

---

## Summary of key points

- **Detection window**: 1–4 days for single use; up to 7–10 days for chronic or heavy use.
- **Factors**: Dose, frequency, metabolism, hydration, and urine pH influence detection time.
- **Testing**: Immunoassay screening followed by confirmatory LC-MS/MS ensures accuracy.
- **Interpretation**: Results must be interpreted within clinical context to avoid misclassification.

### The ASAM / AAAP clinical practice guideline on the management of stimulant use disorder [^112HBtaX]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Toxicology testing for stimulant use disorder (StUD) management — ASAM/AAAP guidance notes that no studies were identified that evaluated the use of toxicology testing as routine diagnostics for suspected stimulant intoxication or withdrawal. There are limitations to the utility of toxicology testing, particularly in emergency settings when samples need to be sent to external laboratories, and clinicians should be aware of the limitations of the tests used. A tradeoff exists between the time delay to process a test versus the accuracy and specificity of the information obtained, screening (ie, presumptive testing) is less accurate than confirmatory tests and has limited utility in acute intoxication or withdrawal management, and observation of clinical effects and patient self-report are often more informative and more immediate. Despite these limitations, toxicology testing in acute care settings has some potential utility by providing valuable information to clinicians delivering follow-up StUD care, helping inform differential diagnosis for presentations such as unspecified agitation, confusion, delirium, psychosis, chest pain, seizure, or autonomic hyperactivity, and identifying substances (prescribed or nonprescribed) that could potentially produce drug–drug interactions when considering pharmacotherapy. Panels used in acute care settings should ideally test for regionally or demographically prevalent stimulants rather than screening for every testable stimulant, and it is critical to keep in mind that a negative test result only confirms that the particular target of the test was not detected in the sample. Immunoassays for the cocaine metabolite, benzoylecgonine, have high sensitivity and specificity, whereas available immunoassays for amphetamines have lower specificity and often require confirmatory testing; there are known limitations to urine immunoassays for amphetamines, and providers should be cautious when interpreting their results.

Qualitative versus quantitative testing — method types and interpretation: A qualitative test is one that detects the presence or absence of a particular compound in a sample, whereas a quantitative test measures the quantity of a particular compound in a sample. Immunoassays are qualitative tests, and most chromatography/mass-spectrometry techniques are quantitative. Quantitative results are reported as the concentration within a sample, and the concentration amount should be used cautiously when interpreting the dose or timing of substance use because of individual differences in metabolism.

ACUTE METHAMPHETAMINE INTOXICATION

Methamphetamine causes an acute sympathomimetic toxidrome that can lead to several life‐threatening complications (Table 2). The half‐life of methamphetamine is 90 min but its principal metabolite,‐amphetamine, has a half‐life of 9–12 h. When evaluating a patient with suspected methamphetamine intoxication, hospitalists should consider a differential diagnosis that includes other sympathomimetic toxidromes (e.g. cocaine, phencyclidine), primary psychotic disorders, endocrinopathies (e.g. hyperthyroidism), and sepsis. The latter can be challenging to diagnose in the context of acute methamphetamine intoxication since methamphetamine use can both mimic sepsis and predispose patients to infection.

Table 2
Complications of acute methamphetamine intoxication.

Hospitalists should be aware that urine immunoassays for amphetamines are particularly prone to false positive results (up to 10%) and may be insensitive for novel psychostimulants. Many common medications cross‐react with screening assays, including bupropion, sildenafil, atenolol, tramadol, duloxetine, aripiprazole, venlafaxine, atomoxetine, and prescribed stimulants (e.g. lisdexamfetamine, dextroamphetamine). Positive results in a patient not reporting methamphetamine use should be sent for confirmatory mass spectrometry.

Management of acute methamphetamine intoxication is primarily supportive and involves providing a low‐stimulus environment, identifying and correcting volume depletion and metabolic derangements, and providing reorientation and reassurance. For acute agitation unresponsive to nonpharmacologic measures, benzodiazepines are considered first‐line therapy. If benzodiazepines are ineffective or contraindicated, or when psychosis symptoms predominate, antipsychotics may be used with caution to avoid over‐sedation if coadministered with benzodiazepines. For refractory agitation, intravenous or intramuscular ketamine may be administered by an experienced clinician.

If significant hypertension and tachycardia persist despite treatment of agitation and hyperactivity with benzodiazepines, it is reasonable to add an alpha‐agonist such as clonidine or a beta‐blocker such as labetalol to reduce the risk of cardiovascular complications. If there is a concern for a true hypertensive emergency with end‐organ damage, short‐acting antihypertensives should be used in accordance with standard practice.

### Diagnostic accuracy for self-reported methamphetamine use versus oral fluid test as the reference standard in a methamphetamine-dependent intervention trial population [^113GoF5f]. Addiction (2023). Medium credibility.

However, very few studies report any accuracy statistics of client self‐reported methamphetamine use when compared with any oral fluid reference standard in clinical populations, and there is considerable heterogeneity in client characteristics, study design, analysis and reporting of diagnostic accuracy statistics, which make any comparisons difficult. Moderate accuracy was reported for self‐reported methamphetamine use (previous 30 days) versus oral fluid detection (kappa = 0.66, sensitivity 60%), poor PPV for amphetamine or methamphetamine use at 47.1% for 3 days and 60.4% for 90 days against oral fluid and poor agreement (kappa = 0.25) for current intoxication with methamphetamine or amphetamine against a Drug Swipe 6S oral fluid screen. None of these studies were in treatment‐seeking populations or used repeated measures.

In this study, we examined the range of diagnostic accuracy statistics, with a special focus on NPV and LR−, for self‐reported methamphetamine use in the previous 7 days (index test) versus assays of oral fluid methamphetamine (and amphetamine) as the reference standard in participants who were dependent upon methamphetamine and were tested weekly during a 12‐week RCT.

CONCLUSIONS

The probability of being positive for methamphetamine in UDT increased nationwide between 2014 and 2019. Copositivity among the methamphetamine-positive population, particularly with opioids, increases the risk of overdose and poor treatment outcomes. Clinicians and public health officials should be aware of the potential health implications associated with methamphetamine use and support strategies to improve health outcomes and the treatment of methamphetamine use disorder.

### Diagnostic accuracy for self-reported methamphetamine use versus oral fluid test as the reference standard in a methamphetamine-dependent intervention trial population [^1145AQN1]. Addiction (2023). Medium credibility.

The second set of limitations concern the appropriateness of the reference standard and time‐period, specifically the ability to detect methamphetamine used in the previous 7 days. We used an assay based on oral fluid samples, with the detection window of 24–72 hours. The third set of limitations concern potential response bias by participants, who understood that their oral fluid samples would be tested on a weekly basis. For the whole sample this regular monitoring could influence more accurate self‐reports. Those who believed themselves to be on active treatment or placebo (despite blindness of allocation) may have a differential response to the TLFB. Under‐reporting could occur where participants unknowingly ingested methamphetamine (e.g. as a contaminant to a different drug) during a reported methamphetamine‐abstinent period.

The fourth set of limitations are relevant to the oral fluid testing. Estimates of sensitivity, specificity and, hence, likelihood ratios may be affected by imperfect reference standards [36]. All methods of estimating the presence of illicit drug use are subject to procedural issues and methamphetamine is no exception. Direct observation of oral fluid collection (as performed in the current study) reduces the risk of adulteration or substitution, reducing oral fluid pH (e.g. by chewing gum to increase saliva production) can reduce methamphetamine concentrations, rinsing may reduce detection, compliance with abstaining from food or beverage consumption prior to testing can be impractical and difficult to control in a non‐experimental setting, and people who use methamphetamine may have reduced production of saliva. Although methamphetamine is reasonably stable in oral fluid, transport and storage arrangements also have the potential to affect the concentration of methamphetamine detected. There is potential for high inter‐ and intra‐individual variability in the relationship between blood and oral fluid levels, so oral fluid levels are a proxy for plasma levels. Confirmatory analysis using LC/MS can be expensive and has restricted availability in some settings. There is no current evidentiary screening device, which can rapidly confirm the presence of methamphetamine in oral fluid. The issue of mass testing (at scale) with immediate results is of particular relevance for the impaired driving situation. However, oral fluid screening for methamphetamine has been shown to be reliable, with confirmation rates of various screening devices greater than 95%, and serves as a potential tool to detect methamphetamine use in this context.

Study procedures

Participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio between groups using variable block randomisation stratified by treatment site. A computer‐generated randomisation schedule was developed by an independent statistician and uploaded to the study database, with randomisation performed by site pharmacists. All other study staff were blinded to treatment allocation and to urine drug screen results.

Study visits occurred daily for the first 5 days, and then twice weekly for the remainder of the study. At each study visit, in‐person supervised medication was administered and in‐person urine samples were taken, vital signs and adverse events were recorded and unused medication returned and reconciled, together with medication adherence counselling. Self‐reported methamphetamine use was recorded weekly. One urine per week was selected at random for analysis by immunoassay for amphetamine‐type substances (cut‐off of 300 ng/ml), followed by confirmation of drug type (methamphetamine, amphetamine or other) by gas chromatography–mass spectroscopy (cut‐off of 150 ng/ml). Long research visits occurred at baseline (Week 1), Weeks 5, 9 and 13 and at follow‐up 4 weeks following the end of medication (Week 19). Additional safety measures were administered at these visits to screen for psychosis (Brief Psychiatric Rating Scaling psychosis and hostility items, suicidality (Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale) and cardiac adverse events [electrocardiogram (ECG)]. Participants were reimbursed with a supermarket voucher at screening and Weeks 1, 5, 9, 13 and 19. Reimbursements started at A$20 and increased by A$10 at each of the five subsequent visits (totalling a maximum per participant of A$270). Medical reviews were conducted at Weeks 5, 9 and 13, together with a post‐study treatment planning session prior to the end of the medication period (Week 15). Participants were withdrawn from study medication if a moderate or severe adverse event thought to be related to the study drug did not resolve after withholding the dose.

### Committee opinion no. 479: methamphetamine abuse in women of reproductive age [^114uhQkG]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2011). Low credibility.

Methamphetamine abuse has continued to increase in the United States since the late 1980s with its use spreading from the West Coast to areas across the country. Methamphetamine use in pregnancy endangers the health of the woman and increases the risk of low birth weight and small for gestational age babies and such use may increase the risk of neurodevelopmental problems in children. All pregnant women should be asked about their drug and alcohol use. Urine toxicology screening may be useful in detecting methamphetamine and other substance abuse during pregnancy, but this screening should only be done with maternal consent after counseling regarding the potential ramifications of a positive test result. Women reporting continuing use of methamphetamine in pregnancy should be referred for treatment and followed up with serial ultrasound examinations to assess fetal growth.

### Generating timely estimates of overdose deaths for the US using urine drug test data [^111dYN64]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Exposure Data

This retrospective study included aggregated, monthly UDT results from the Millennium Health proprietary database. Urine drug tests were ordered by clinicians based on medical necessity and were collected between January 1, 2015, and January 31, 2025. Included urine specimens were obtained from patients aged 18 years or older and collected in substance use disorder treatment health care practices from all 50 states and the District of Columbia.

Urine specimens were analyzed by liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The LC-MS/MS testing method is a laboratory-developed test with performance characteristics established by Millennium Health, which is certified by the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments and accredited by the College of American Pathologists for high-complexity testing.

The results of individual tests were aggregated by the month of specimen collection, allowing for the calculation of (1) positivity rates and (2) mean normalized drug levels among positive tests for each month. Monthly positivity rates for a given drug were calculated by dividing the number of positive tests by the total number of tests. To aggregate mean drug levels, the mean values of creatinine-normalized concentrations (nanograms of analyte divided by milligrams of creatinine) among drug-positive tests were taken. Creatinine concentrations were photometrically identified via the Jaffe method.

For this analysis, 2 drugs were chosen to generate independent variables: fentanyl and methamphetamine (among the sample testing positive for fentanyl). These variables were chosen, first, given our understanding that the fourth wave of the overdose crisis has been defined by fentanyl use and fentanyl-stimulant polysubstance useand, second, to ensure model parsimony (see the eAppendix in Supplement 1 for a detailed discussion on variable selection). As such, 4 exposure variables were generated and included as continuous variables in the models described: (1) fentanyl positivity, (2) mean normalized fentanyl levels, (3) methamphetamine positivity (among the sample testing positive for fentanyl), and (4) mean normalized methamphetamine levels (among the sample testing positive for fentanyl). To account for the association of outlying observations, the levels of both drugs were aggregated into 3-month rolling mean values.

At most, a single urine specimen was included per month for each patient by excluding any subsequent urine specimens collected from that same patient within a 31-day period to ensure the independence of monthly aggregated UDT positivity rates and reduce the likelihood that 2 positive tests were the result of the same episode of drug use.

Urine testing — role in addiction treatment and point‑of‑care tests (POCTs) — states that urine should be considered the most well‑established and well‑supported biological matrix for presumptive detection of substance use in a clinical setting, and urine should be considered the best established matrix for POCTs. If tampering is of high concern or appropriate measures to reduce the likelihood of tampering cannot be taken, providers should consider using an alternative specimen type.

FIGURE 1
Predicted methamphetamine detection probabilities for US census divisions. Notes: Predicted probabilities (95%CI) for methamphetamine detection were calculated for each US census division and collection year using the logistic regression model summarized in Table 2. The black line and confidence band represents Total US prediction probabilities derived from the collection year main effect.

Codetection of Drug Classes With Methamphetamine Usage

Nine independent regression models were constructed for each of the nonmethamphetamine drugs or drug classes using the same demographic features as above. In addition, methamphetamine detection status (positive or negative) was added as an explanatory factor. For each regression, the detection status of the drug or drug class of interest was modeled as the dependent variable. A 3-way interaction, and all possible 2-way interactions, of collection year, census division, and methamphetamine detection status were included in each model. All models were found to be highly significant based on individual likelihood ratio tests (see Table, Supplemental Digital Content 1).

We evaluated the aOR from each of the nine copositivity models to determine if methamphetamine positivity was associated with positivity for any of the nine drugs and drug classes evaluated (Table 3). For each census division and year, an aOR was calculated. If the aOR is significantly greater than 1, the odds of being positive for the drug or drug class is greater than the odds in the methamphetamine-negative population. Many of the aOR CIs do not overlap one, indicating statistical significance and that the methamphetamine-positive population has higher illicit and non-prescribed drug positivity than the methamphetamine-negative population.

TABLE 3
Copositivity Analysis – Methamphetamine Positive Versus Negative Population Odds Ratios

Nationally, aOR values are significantly greater than 1 for most years and across several drugs and drug classes (Table 3). Fentanyl, heroin, and other opioids had the highest overall aORs nationally in 2019, and these aORs increased from 2014 to 2019 (Fig. 2, Table 3). A Kendall correlation test showed that the increases over time in aOR for methamphetamine copositivity with heroin (P = 0.024) and fentanyl (P = 0.0085) were statistically significant (see Table, Supplemental Digital Content 2, showing Kendall correlation test results for each of copositive drugs). Although national aORs for buprenorphine and other opioids also increased between 2014 and 2019, these changes were not significant. Decreases in national aORs for benzodiazepines, cocaine, alcohol, methadone, and THC were not significant.

### Riluzole for treatment of men with methamphetamine dependence: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial [^115PquFk]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Riluzole is a glutamate regulator and effective in treatment of neuropsychiatric conditions.

Aims

We assessed riluzole for treatment of methamphetamine dependence.

Methods

In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, male outpatients with methamphetamine dependence who were 18–65 years old received either 50 mg riluzole (n = 34) or placebo (n = 54) twice daily for 12 weeks. Patients were excluded in case of comorbid serious medical conditions or neurologic disorders, comorbid psychiatric disorders other than methamphetamine dependence requiring specific treatment interventions, simultaneous positive urine test result for substances of abuse other than methamphetamine, smoking > 3 days per week, simultaneous consumption of medications which are contraindicated or have interaction with riluzole.

Results

Concerning primary outcomes, the cumulative mean number of attended weekly visits was higher in the riluzole arm compared with the placebo arm approaching a statistically significant difference (riluzole, median (range) = 13.00 (2.00–13.00); placebo = 4.00 (2.00–13.00); Mann-Whitney U = 505.00, p-value = 0.073), and the weekly measured rate of positive methamphetamine urine test results was significantly lower in the riluzole arm by the end of the study (riluzole = 1 (5.00%), placebo = 9 (45.00%), p-value = 0.004). Patients in the riluzole arm experienced significantly greater improvement on all the craving, withdrawal, and depression measures regarding mean score changes from baseline to endpoint. No significant difference was detected between the two arms in terms of incidence of adverse events.

Conclusion

Future randomized clinical trials are needed to investigate proper dosing strategy in a more inclusive sample.

### Risk factors for methamphetamine use in youth: a systematic review [^113nB5Ei]. BMC Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Methamphetamine (MA), also known as crystal meth, is a synthetic stimulant that affects the brain and central nervous system. Smoking is the most common route of administration for MA. When smoked or injected, it produces an initial rush that lasts only a couple of minutes but is intensely pleasurable. This is followed by a prolonged high that results in an extended period of euphoria. The half-life of MA ranges from 10–30 hours depending on the purity of the drug, urine pH, and the amount consumed. Like other psychoactive drugs of abuse, chronic MA use can result in tolerance, where increased amounts of MA are required to produce the same high.

Because MA is a stimulant, it produces physiological and psychological effects similar to those elicited by cocaine. MA stimulates the release of dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin, and blocks their reuptake. This excess amount of neurotransmitters in the synapses produces sensations of euphoria, lowered inhibitions, feelings of invincibility, increased wakefulness, heightened sexual experiences, and hyperactivity resulting from increased energy for extended periods of time. Deleterious short-term effects include increased heart and respiration rates, hyperthermia, chest pain, hypertension, increased respiration, decreased appetite, anorexia, irritability, confusion, tremors, convulsions, anxiety, aggressiveness, and symptoms of psychosis such as hallucinations and paranoia. This is followed by mental and physical exhaustion, headaches, irritability, reduced concentration, hunger, decreased energy, anhedonia, and a craving for more MA. Cognitive impairments and changes in the brain that result in symptoms similar to those of Parkinson's disease can occur. Long-term use of MA use is associated with neurotoxicity, neurodegeneration, and clinical depression that may lead to homicidal and suicidal ideation and action.

### The cyclical and evolving nature of methamphetamine use: an evaluation of near real-time urine drug test results [^117UACar]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Knowing the methamphetamine landscape is shifting and has important public health implications, in this analysis, the authors identify national and regional trends of UDT results for methamphetamine in a population seeking health care, as well as copositivity with select drugs and drug classes. Identifying trends in methamphetamine use through near real-time urine drug testing data may help ascertain areas of the country most affected by the methamphetamine use crisis and better inform those involved in care and prevention efforts. In addition to providing timely analysis of use, the inclusion of copositivity helps shed light on the likelihood of various drug combinations with methamphetamine, which may have implications in the treatment of acute toxicity and substance use disorders (SUDs).

### Fentanyl, heroin, methamphetamine, and cocaine analyte concentrations in urine drug testing specimens [^114hLjCD]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

This study also sheds light on increased stimulant use and related overdose deaths in the US; specifically, concentrations of methamphetamine in urine specimens increased steadily throughout the study period, with steep increases starting in 2020 in the West North Central, West South Central, Mountain, Pacific, and East South Central regions. This finding corresponds to increased methamphetamine use, risk behaviors associated with use, and methamphetamine-related overdose deaths. Concentrations of cocaine in urine specimens were somewhat stable between 2014 and 2020, with larger increases beginning in 2021, especially in the Mid-Atlantic, South Atlantic, West South Central, and New England regions. The majority of cocaine-related overdose deaths involved opioids, with an approximately 6-fold increase since 2015. Moreover, both methamphetamine and cocaine use are known to adversely affect OUD treatment outcomes; concurrent use of both opioids and stimulants is associated with increased drug craving, drug use, and treatment attrition. Individuals presenting to treatment with opioid-stimulant concurrent use might require additional services to attain a beneficial outcome. Additionally, given the increasing fentanyl adulteration in the stimulant supply in many areas of the US, drug-checking services might be particularly important for individuals who primarily use stimulants because inadvertent exposure to fentanyl in persons without opioid tolerance could precede an unexpected and fatal drug overdose.

Increases in fentanyl exposure present several unique challenges to persons with SUDs, potentially underlying reports of persons requiring more than 1 naloxone administration for overdose reversals, although this is not a universal phenomenonand is likely changed by concurrent use of other drugs. Increases in fentanyl concentration in urine specimens may also inform challenges in inducting patients from IMF onto buprenorphine, which has reportedly precipitated opioid withdrawal syndrome, aversive enough that it reduced patients' interest in future buprenorphine treatment. There are established micro-level and macro-level induction methods to transition individuals who use IMF onto buprenorphine maintenance, and buprenorphine remains an effective treatment for acute opioid withdrawal in emergency medicine. Individuals with SUD who regularly use IMF may require higher doses of buprenorphine or methadone, and efforts to expand access to both buprenorphine and methadone may reduce overdose risk and improve long-term outcomes for these persons.

Diagnostic Approach

No consensus on diagnostic criteria for MACM currently exists. In the literature, the presumptive diagnosis of MACM has been based on recent methamphetamine use or positive urine toxicological findings, and exclusion of other common causes of HF. We recommend obtaining a detailed history on drug use, including duration and frequency (Table). Physical examination may uncover signs of methamphetamine use. Urine toxicological findings are helpful to detect recent use, as methamphetamine may be present in the urine for up to 2 and 4 days with short‐ and long‐term use, respectively. Caution is advised as high false‐positive rates are possible with medications, such as pseudoephedrine, ephedrine, phenylephrine, bupropion, trazadone, promethazine, and ranitidine. 74 An echocardiogram is useful in detecting findings of severe LV dysfunction or biventricular failure with global hypokinesis and Takotsubo or reversed Takotsubo‐like appearance. Contrast echocardiography may be needed to confirm the presence of intracardiac thrombus. 75 Ischemic evaluation is often warranted, especially in patients presenting with chest pain, troponin elevation, and wall motion abnormalities. CMR may be useful for assessment of the presence and degree of myocardial fibrosis, a strong predictor of reversibility of cardiac function, and the presence of intracardiac thrombus. 76, 77

ASAM/AAAP stimulant use disorder — categorization by substance and pharmacology: The recommendations for non-psychostimulant and psychostimulant medications have been categorized by substance type (cocaine use disorder and ATS use disorder) due to different pharmacological mechanisms that may impact effectiveness, with cocaine and ATS both increasing dopamine signaling; cocaine blocks dopamine reuptake, whereas methamphetamine both increases dopamine release and blocks its reuptake, resulting in higher concentrations. Methamphetamine's half-life of 10 to 12 hours is significantly longer than cocaine's 1-hour half-life, leading to more prolonged effects.

### Diagnostic accuracy for self-reported methamphetamine use versus oral fluid test as the reference standard in a methamphetamine-dependent intervention trial population [^113M9Kzk]. Addiction (2023). Medium credibility.

Even when confidentiality is assured, the use of illicit substances may be denied or under‐reported. The non‐disclosure of illicit drug use can result from embarrassment, fear of punishment, social disapproval or cultural issues. 'Over‐reporting' is uncommon for self‐reported drug use, and in the Australian criminal justice system, the under‐reporting of illicit drug use was more common by people who use cocaine or methamphetamine than those using heroin when verified against a urinalysis test. Thus, the key question for clinicians is, if the client reports no recent methamphetamine use, how likely is this report to be correct?

Although the full range of diagnostic accuracy statistics is important to understand for a given diagnostic test, for clinical utility and to answer the clinician's key question the most relevant diagnostic accuracy statistics for self‐report of recent methamphetamine use would be the negative predictive value (NPV) and the likelihood ratio negative (LR−). The NPV tells a clinician what proportion of client reports of no recent use are correct, and the LR− shows the change from pre‐ to post‐test probability for the clinician to judge if this additional change in probability is clinically useful. There is no absolute NPV level that is considered to be clinically useful and clinician judgement is required to take into account the clinical circumstances, including the consequences of accepting a negative test that may be a false negative. Perhaps the most important consideration is the prevalence of the condition in the population being examined because of the impact on NPV. Conversely, a LR− value of < 0.1 is usually considered to be a 'good' diagnostic test, and the LR− is not affected by prevalence of the condition of interest. Another important difference concerns the interpretation of results from repeated testing required in monitoring for drug use, which means that a clinician has a more complex task to interpret the accuracy of an individual test in the context of repeated testing in an individual, with a resulting lack of independence for each observation. Diagnostic tests for most diseases are intended to identify a disease that is either present or absent, although some tests may be used for relapsing conditions — for example, the dexamethasone suppression test for depression — so often require only a single test or a small number of sequential tests, while methamphetamine or other drug use can be intermittent and require multiple regular testing.

Amphetamines — urine testing is helpful when assessing a patient's amphetamine use, but there are known limitations to urine immunoassays for amphetamines and providers should be cautious when interpreting their results. Amphetamine immunoassays are also subject to cross-reactivity with other substances, and providers should know the sensitivity and specificity of the test being used for each of the amphetamine variants; the testing laboratory will have this information.

RESULTS

Study Population Demographics

Two million methamphetamine UDT results from individual patients, received between January 1, 2014, and December 31, 2019, were analyzed (Table 1). Of the analyzed specimens, 106,405 (5.32%) were positive for nonprescribed methamphetamine. The median age (interquartile range) was 44 (19–69) years for the entire sample population and 35 (19–51) years for the methamphetamine-positive population. The sample population was 54.72% female compared to 49.11% for the methamphetamine-positive population. The largest number of specimens came from pain management practices (28.47%) and primary care physicians (24.05%). However, SUD treatment centers (46.97%) and behavioral health (19.98%) were the most frequent specialties with specimens positive for methamphetamine. Although the greatest number of specimens were from the South Atlantic (19.16%) and East North Central (16.95%) divisions, the largest number of methamphetamine positives were found in the Pacific (32.94%) and Mountain (13.27%) divisions. This is concordant with reports of higher methamphetamine availability in western states.

TABLE 1
Characteristics of UDT Specimens Tested Between January 1, 2014 and December 31, 2019

In addition to methamphetamine, 9 drugs and drug classes were evaluated. Testing for additional drugs and drug classes was not ordered in all 2 million specimens (Table 1). Cocaine (n = 1,938,686), THC (n = 1,774,320), and methadone (n = 1,771,528) were ordered most frequently.

Other opioids and THC were detected most frequently in both the total sample population and the methamphetamine-positive population; however, there were clear differences in drug and drug class positivity rates for the methamphetamine-positive population relative to the total sample population. Heroin shows the largest percent difference, with a positivity rate of 12.48% in the methamphetamine-positive group compared with 2.20% positivity in the total sample population (Table 1).

### A double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of modafinil (200 mg / day) for methamphetamine dependence [^114vzSvs]. Addiction (2009). Low credibility.

Aim

To examine the safety and efficacy of modafinil (200 mg/day) compared to placebo in the treatment of methamphetamine dependence and to examine predictors of post-treatment outcome.

Participants and Design

Eighty methamphetamine-dependent subjects in Sydney, Australia were allocated randomly to modafinil (200 mg/day) (n = 38) or placebo (n = 42) under double-blind conditions for 10 weeks with a further 12 weeks post-treatment follow-up.

Measures

Comprehensive drug use data (urine specimens and self-report) and other health and psychosocial data were collected weekly during treatment and research interviews at baseline, week 10 and week 22.

Results

Treatment retention and medication adherence were equivalent between groups. There were no differences in methamphetamine abstinence, craving or severity of dependence. Medication-compliant subjects tended to provide more methamphetamine-negative urine samples over the 10-week treatment period (P = 0.07). Outcomes were better for methamphetamine-dependent subjects with no other substance dependence and those who accessed counselling. There were statistically significant reductions in systolic blood pressure (P = 0.03) and weight gain (P = 0.05) in modafinil-compliant subjects compared to placebo. There were no medication-related serious adverse events. Adverse events were generally mild and consistent with known pharmacological effects.

Conclusions

Modafinil demonstrated promise in reducing methamphetamine use in selected methamphetamine-dependent patients. The study findings support definitive trials of modafinil in larger multi-site trials.

### Diagnostic accuracy for self-reported methamphetamine use versus oral fluid test as the reference standard in a methamphetamine-dependent intervention trial population [^116f6ati]. Addiction (2023). Medium credibility.

Limitations of the study

First, data were derived from a randomized trial study design of a pharmacological intervention with repeated measures of the reference and index standards. The most commonly used study design for diagnostic accuracy would be a cross‐sectional design in a relevant population, showing the full range of the severity of the condition at the prevalence rate characteristic of that population, although other study designs are possible. In our population and clinical setting, a cross‐sectional design at a single time‐point would be less relevant than repeated testing on each weekly clinic visit. The criteria for entry into an intervention trial will produce a sampling bias so that the study population would not be likely to represent the full spectrum of severity (frequency and severity of recent use) of the condition of interest, so our estimates of sensitivity, specificity and LRs might be affected. The prevalence of the condition of interest in the population (at 79%) was probably higher than in most treatment populations, and as higher prevalence populations will yield relatively lower NPV estimates, our reported estimates for NPV might be conservative.

### Objective testing: urine and other drug tests [^117JwDpL]. Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Drug testing, when carefully collected and thoughtfully interpreted, offers a critical adjunct to clinical care and substance use treatment. However, because test results can be misleading if not interpreted in the correct clinical context, clinicians should always conduct a careful interview with adolescent patients to understand what testing is likely to show and then use testing to validate or refute their expectations. Because of the ease with which samples can be tampered, providers should also carefully reflect on their own collection protocols and sample validation procedures to ensure optimal accuracy".

### Generating timely estimates of overdose deaths for the US using urine drug test data [^111WfSg2]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Importance

Provisional estimates of fatal drug overdoses in the US are lagging by 6 months. Efforts to estimate the overdose burden for this 6-month lag window require up-to-date data, such as real-time urine drug test (UDT) data, capable of identifying sudden changes in the overdose trajectory, such as the increase in overdose deaths experienced at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Objective

To evaluate the utility of using aggregated UDT data to estimate national-level drug overdose deaths for the 6-month lag window in which overdose data are unavailable.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cross-sectional study included 3 135 748 urine samples submitted for UDT by Millennium Health from patients aged 18 years or older in substance use disorder treatment health care facilities across the US between January 1, 2015, and January 31, 2025. Urine drug test results were aggregated to generate monthly positivity rates and mean creatinine-normalized levels of fentanyl and methamphetamine (among the sample testing positive for fentanyl). Monthly, national drug overdose mortality counts were obtained from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Exposures

Urine drug testing.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Drug overdose death totals were estimated for every 6-month period from January to June 2019 through August 2024 to January 2025 by training generalized linear models with a negative binomial distribution on the preceding 4 years of data and using monthly UDT data to generate overdose estimates for the 6-month lag window of interest. Mean absolute error (MAE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and root mean squared error (RMSE) were calculated by comparing projected monthly estimates with observed overdose death totals.

Results

A total of 3 135 748 UDT specimens (57.2% from men; mean [SD] age, 38.1 [12.4] years) were included in this study. From 2019 to August 2024, 537 104 people died of an overdose in the US, with a substantial increase in early 2020 at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. The UDT modeling strategy (MAPE, 7.1%; MAE, 540.9 deaths per month; RMSE, 659.4) outperformed the baseline autoregressive integrated moving average model (MAPE, 9.0%; MAE, 704.9 deaths per month; RMSE, 1075.8) across all metrics. Furthermore, the model detected the sudden increase in overdose deaths at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this cross-sectional study, findings suggested that aggregated UDT data may be used to estimate up-to-date overdose death trends. Model implementation can be improved by introducing additional exposure variables, such as those related to drug seizures and syndromic surveillance.

### Lisdexamfetamine in the treatment of methamphetamine dependence: a randomised, placebo-controlled trial [^115Ck9CU]. Addiction (2025). Medium credibility.

There were five serious adverse events in the lisdexamfetamine group. Most adverse events were mild or moderate; nausea was more frequent in the lisdexamfetamine group. Post‐hoc analysis detected transient mild (< 4 mmHg) increases in diastolic blood pressure at two time‐points. Future investigation of lisdexamfetamine 250 mg daily requires continued cautious cardiovascular and neuropsychiatric monitoring, given the risks of adverse outcomes associated with methamphetamine use and the known adverse event profile of prescribed psychostimulants.

The proportion of urinalyses positive for methamphetamine is the most commonly reported outcome measure in RCTs of psychostimulants for amphetamine type stimulant use disorder. We selected a primary outcome of difference in days of use. Self‐report is a sufficiently valid measure, and the combination of urine toxicology and self‐report enhances the validity of self‐reported substance use. The study design precluded verification of self‐reported use days by weekly urinalysis results due to differences in the periodicity in the two data sources. Reduced frequency of use is a valid outcome measure associated with improved drug use, health and wellbeing. Nonetheless, there is no consensus on clinically meaningful reduction in use. There is, however, growing recognition of participant‐reported outcome measures as alternative end‐points. We found positive findings regarding self‐reported treatment effectiveness and drug effect. This aspect of the treatment might be important for treatment uptake and underscores an imperative for stronger efficacy data.

Lisdexamfetamine 250 mg daily, relative to placebo, is associated with reduction of use over a 12‐week treatment period but not the last 4 weeks of treatment among people with methamphetamine dependence using on at least 14 of the previous 28 days. Lisdexamfetamine was associated with participant‐reported treatment effectiveness and overall satisfaction. The place of lisdexamfetamine in the treatment of methamphetamine dependence remains inconclusive.

### Fentanyl, heroin, methamphetamine, and cocaine analyte concentrations in urine drug testing specimens [^111u4QZR]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

A complete understanding of the potential clinical implications of changes in drug exposure — especially differences in the absolute exposure levels of IMF and stimulants — has been hampered by a lack of sensitive surveillance methods that permit quantitative analyses of opioid and stimulant use. Existing reports are derived primarily from evaluations of overdose deaths, drug testing programs, broad epidemiological assessments, or ethnographic surveys of persons who use drugs, all of which provide limited scope and are affected by regionally specific differences in reporting methods. Systematic, objective data regarding drug exposure are primarily obtained from wastewater analyses, but despite quantitative urine drug testing (UDT) for these substances having been performed in clinical practice for decades, population-level analyses of these data are lacking.

Herein, to quantify changes in absolute drug exposure concentrations from 2013 to 2023, we analyzed quantitative UDT data for fentanyl, heroin, cocaine, and methamphetamine from over 900 000 urine specimens collected in substance use disorder (SUD) treatment settings throughout the US. Samples were tested for the quantitative level of exposure.

### The cyclical and evolving nature of methamphetamine use: an evaluation of near real-time urine drug test results [^114VsEEX]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Limitations

Data are limited to a population of patients seeking health care and may not reflect the general population. Individuals included in the analysis may have had an incomplete or inaccurate medication list, which would result in the inclusion of some subjects expected to be positive for prescribed analytes. The study used a convenience sample and patient characteristics changed through time. We attempted to account for this variation by modeling sex, age, and health care specialty because of their strong impact on nonprescribed drug positivity. It is possible that these covariates were insufficient to remove all potential confounding and/or selection bias. The

"other opioids" class of drugs studied includes morphine, which is a potential metabolite of heroin. Lastly, the designated health care specialty may include patient populations that would also fit a different specialty, such as patients with cooccurring mental health and SUDs being treated at a behavioral health practice versus a SUD treatment center.

### Analysis of urine drug test results from substance use disorder treatment practices and overdose mortality rates, 2013–2020 [^114737WT]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Importance

Drug overdose deaths in the US are currently the highest ever recorded; data collected from public health surveillance sources can help to identify emerging drug use patterns associated with overdose mortality rates, but the time lag in results often limits utility. Urine drug testing (UDT) is one potentially underused source that could augment surveillance efforts through timely data collection.

Objective

To evaluate the correlation between real-time UDT results from a proprietary national database and overdose mortality data from the National Vital Statistics System.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This retrospective cross-sectional study included 500 000 urine specimens submitted for UDT by substance use disorder (SUD) treatment health care practices and collected between January 1, 2013, and December 31, 2020. Real-time UDT data were obtained from the Millennium Health proprietary national database, and overdose mortality data were obtained from the National Vital Statistics System of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC WONDER). Specimens were analyzed for specific drugs in 5 categories (cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine, synthetic opioids, and other opioids) using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Participants were adults aged 18 years and older who provided urine specimens at SUD treatment practices.

Exposures

Urine drug testing.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was the correlation between UDT positivity rates and overdose mortality rates at national, state, and county levels. Univariate and multivariate regression models were also used to evaluate the association between state- and county-level overdose mortality and standardized UDT positivity rates.

Results

Among 500 000 unique patient specimens collected from SUD treatment practices between 2013 and 2020, 288 534 specimens (57.7%) were from men, and the median age of the study population was 34 years (IQR, 17–51 years). On a national level, synthetic opioids and methamphetamine were highly correlated with overdose mortality (Spearman ρ = 0.96 for both). When synthetic opioids were coinvolved, methamphetamine (ρ = 0.98), heroin (ρ = 0.78), cocaine (ρ = 0.94), and other opioids (ρ = 0.83) were also highly correlated with overdose mortality. In the absence of synthetic opioids, all drug categories were highly correlated (ρ = 0.75 for other opioids, 0.81 for heroin, and 0.88 for methamphetamine), with the exception of cocaine (ρ = -0.37). Synthetic opioids (ρ = 0.77) and methamphetamine (ρ = 0.80) had the strongest state-level correlations over time, whereas other opioids had the lowest correlation for both total positivity (ρ = 0.31) and positivity in the absence of synthetic opioids (ρ = 0.23). In Ohio, county-level correlation was strongest for synthetic opioids (ρ = 0.71), followed by heroin (ρ = 0.69) and methamphetamine (ρ = 0.67). At the state level, the multivariate incidence rate ratio (IRR) for synthetic opioids was 1.16 (95% CI, 1.14–1.19; P < .001), and at the county level, the IRR was 1.13 (95% CI, 1.09–1.17; P < .001), suggesting that for every 1-SD increase in the UDT positivity rate, there were 16.2% and 12.8% increases, respectively, in monthly overdose deaths. Both methamphetamine (11.7% increase per 1-SD increase in UDT positivity rate; IRR,1.12; 95% CI, 1.09–1.14; P < .001) and cocaine (5.1% increase per 1-SD increase in UDT positivity rate; IRR,1.05; 95% CI, 1.03–1.07; P < .001) also had significant positive associations with mortality rates, but the effect sizes were smaller than that of synthetic opioids (IRR, 1.16).

Conclusions and Relevance

In this study, UDT results were highly correlated with mortality rates at national, state, and county levels. These findings suggest that real-time UDT surveillance can help to quickly identify changes in drug use patterns that might inform targeted harm reduction strategies designed to prevent overdose deaths.

### Methamphetamine hydrochloride [^116x6cxs]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Amphetamines are non-catecholamine sympathomimetic amines with CNS stimulant activity. The exact mode of therapeutic action in the treatment of ADHD is not known.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Amphetamines block the reuptake of norepinephrine and dopamine into the presynaptic neuron and increase the release of these monoamines into the extraneuronal space.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Absorption

Methamphetamine is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract.

Elimination

Metabolism

The primary site of metabolism is in the liver by aromatic hydroxylation, N-dealkylation and deamination. At least seven metabolites have been identified in the urine. The biological half-life has been reported in the range of 4 to 5 hours.

Excretion

Excretion occurs primarily in the urine and is dependent on urine pH. Alkaline urine will significantly increase the drug half-life. Approximately 62% of an oral dose is eliminated in the urine within the first 24 hours with about one-third as intact drug and the remainder as metabolites.

Limitations

This study was limited by the observational nature of the data collection, which lacked experimental control over the time elapsed between last drug use and urine specimen collection. Additionally, UDT data cannot differentiate intentional from unintentional (eg, stimulants adulterated with opioids or vice versa) exposures, and concurrent use was not examined in these analyses. Furthermore, this study did not examine other drug use patterns that may be related to concurrent use or adulteration of the illicit drug supply, such as benzodiazepines or xylazine, but these factors are also associated with risk of drug overdose and have treatment implications. Moreover, individuals with SUD who were seeking treatment might differ in substance use patterns from individuals with SUD who were not seeking treatment.

### Diagnostic accuracy for self-reported methamphetamine use versus oral fluid test as the reference standard in a methamphetamine-dependent intervention trial population [^113KZcCs]. Addiction (2023). Medium credibility.

Likelihood ratios

Likelihood ratios should be an optimal choice for reporting diagnostic accuracy, and it is important to report paired measures (predictive values and likelihood ratios) for clinically meaningful thresholds. Specificity and sensitivity are used to calculate the likelihood ratios, so neither LR+ nor LR− directly depend upon condition prevalence, although the spectrum of clients and condition severity effect sensitivity and specificity and may thereby be indirectly related to prevalence of the condition. LR− values are directly linked to post‐test probabilities; the lower the LR−, the stronger the evidence for absence of the condition. In our study, a LR− of 0.06 implies a substantial improvement in post‐test probability, which implies that the self‐report of no recent methamphetamine use (index test) would be useful to the clinician relying upon that client self‐report to monitor treatment response, whatever the prevalence of the condition in that clinical population.

'Over‐reporting' methamphetamine use

We found 949 occasions of positive self‐reported methamphetamine use in the previous 7 days, with 87 (9.2%) of these occasions recording a negative test of oral fluid using LC–MS/MS. It is likely that most of these negative tests of oral fluid came about because of the effective detection window of methamphetamine in oral fluid, which varies based on the assay used and populations studied: 5–48 hours after ingestion (non‐clinical and clinical populations) or 24–72 hours for the assay used in our study, which is shorter (at both ends of the detection window) than the self‐report period of 7 days used in our study. We believe it is unlikely that 'over‐reporting' of methamphetamine use would have been common in the context of this intervention trial.

### Appropriate use of drug testing in clinical addiction medicine [^1171BMHu]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Biological matrices for drug testing — urine, blood, exhaled breath, oral fluid (saliva), sweat and hair are all biological matrices that are used in drug testing, and each matrix offers advantages and disadvantages within the desired window of detection. Biological drug testing detects the presence or absence of parent drug compounds and/or their metabolites, which remain in the body for longer periods of time, in a biological matrix, and drugs and their metabolites become present in the body primarily by being absorbed into the bloodstream and then distributed to other matrices via mechanisms such as passive diffusion and ultrafiltration. The physiological distribution of drugs implies a varying relationship between the concentration a drug or metabolite has in different matrices depending on properties such as lipid solubility, acid dissociation (pKa) and protein binding tendency, and for example, drugs that are more acidic (eg, benzodiazepines) will have higher concentrations in fluids with higher pH (eg, plasma/blood) while more basic drugs (eg, amphetamines and opiates) will have higher concentrations in fluids with lower pH (eg, saliva/oral fluid).

### Fentanyl, heroin, methamphetamine, and cocaine analyte concentrations in urine drug testing specimens [^111r4CS1]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Although these consequences are often attributed to IMF's increased potency compared with heroin, these data provide the first evidence that persons are presenting to treatment for SUDs with unprecedented concentrations of drug exposure. The pharmacokinetic profiles of these substances may partially explain outcomes as well. Therapeutically delivered fentanyl is known to be sequestered in peripheral fat and muscle stores and subject to a delayed, compartmental clearance process, although sequestration and clearance of supratherapeutic doses of IMF remain poorly understood. Methamphetamine (but not cocaine) is also sequestered into peripheral organsand demonstrates extended urinary clearance patterns with accumulation after long-term dosing. Thus, the significant increases in fentanyl (by 8.30-fold) and methamphetamine (by 5.20-fold) concentrations observed in this study may reflect peripheral accumulation, changes in absolute concentration, or a combination of these phenomena. These data suggest that persons presenting to treatment with IMF, methamphetamine, or concurrent use likely have some level of peripheral accumulation, which independently predisposes them to health consequences, such as fentanyl- and methamphetamine-specific withdrawal syndromes, sensitization and delayed onset of respiratory depression after fentanyl exposure, and organ ischemia and hypertension associated with methamphetamine and cocaine exposures.

The findings of this study also support future efforts to leverage analyses of drug concentrations in urine samples that are being tested routinely as part of SUD treatment. Compared with existing surveillance methods (eg, wastewater testing, death certificate review, and ethnographic survey), aggregated quantitative UDT data offer a scalable surveillance method that can provide swift and nimble feedback on real-time changes in drug exposure levels as well as emerging public threats (eg, xylazine) that are not routinely captured by other methods. Efforts to quickly respond to a shifting drug supply can complement larger initiatives, such as the Stanford-Lancet Commission on the North American Opioid Crisis, which seeks to prevent the onset of nonmedical opioid use by promoting opioid stewardship among regulatory bodies and clinicians as well as to integrate evidence-based, equitable, and enduring SUD treatment into the US health care system.

### Urine amphetamine screening and suicidality: a 5-year retrospective analysis of emergency department patients [^112j3mqK]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Suicidal patients in the emergency department commonly undergo immunoassay-based urine drug screening prior to psychiatry evaluation. Amphetamine use is common and can increase the risk of psychosis, depression, and suicidality.

Objectives

To characterize the prevalence of positive amphetamine screening in suicidal emergency department patients and assess the impact of this on disposition planning.

Methods

We performed a retrospective observational study of suicidal adult patients who presented to 2 academic emergency departments between May 1, 2015 to April 30, 2020. Demographic, urine drug screening results, and disposition details were collected.

Results

Of 388,931 encounters, 11,885 were included and 3,225 (27.1%) had a positive amphetamine urine screen. Of the 3,158 who underwent confirmatory testing, 94.7% were confirmed methamphetamine. Of the screen positives, 17.9% were admitted and 74.5% were discharged. 29.7% of screen negatives were admitted and 59.2% were discharged. The median emergency department length of stay for admitted patients was 18 hours, 29 minutes for screen positives and 16 hours, 54 minutes for screen negatives; for discharged patients, the median was 14 hours, 26 minutes (IQR 9:01–20:33) for screen positives and 11 hours, 48 minutes (IQR 6:52–18:08) for screen negatives. 48.0% of discharged screen positives had lengths of stay exceeding 15 hours, compared with 36.5% of screen negatives. Differences in admission and discharge rates and lengths of stay were statistically significant (p < 0.001).

Conclusions

In this patient population, positive amphetamine screening resulted in more frequent emergency department discharge when compared to those with negative amphetamine screens. Extended lengths of stay were more common for screen positive patients compared with screen negative patients. These findings are consistent with prior literature. Larger studies are needed to fully assess the impact of urine amphetamine screening on emergency psychiatric care and disposition.

### Is methamphetamine blood concentration in emergency department patients associated with the clinical picture? [^113evyc5]. Addiction (2025). Medium credibility.

Psychosis, predominantly paranoia and thought disorder, was common in our cohort, but usually transient, with most patients discharged from the emergency department or the adjacent observation ward. Persistent psychiatric symptoms requiring admission were only seen in a small proportion. Similar findings were found in another recent Australian study. We did not collect data on the frequency or pattern of methamphetamine usage in these patients, which is known to be associated with the likelihood of psychosis. Future research in an emergency department cohort investigating the medium term exposure pattern to methamphetamine and sleep quality in such patients would aid interpretation of the concentration data from our study.

Acute psychosis associated with methamphetamine use can differ from that seen in schizophrenia. The most distinguishing feature appears to be its transient nature, resolving on cessation of methamphetamine use sometimes with the aid of sedative and antipsychotic medication. However, the character of symptoms can also be different, with paranoid delusions predominating in methamphetamine induced psychosis, whereas in schizophrenia other symptoms may predominate, such as complex auditory hallucinations and delusions of reference. It has been proposed that the presence of the latter symptoms in patients with a history of methamphetamine use could increase the likelihood they might be suffering from a primary psychotic disorder.

Although a large number of symptoms and signs were assessed for association with methamphetamine concentration, multivariable analysis only showed a significant difference in concentration in patients with heart palpitations or with choreoathetoid movements, which are random jerking or writhing movements of the face, limbs or trunk. Mean or median vital signs were within normal ranges, with the exception of heart rate. Sympathomimetic features, which might be expected after stimulant drug exposure such as dilated pupils and hyperthermia, were not generally a feature of this cohort. These findings may be due in part to any delay in presentation of these patients post initial drug exposure. We propose that aside from heart rate, physiological criteria are not useful as a screening tool for methamphetamine use in the emergency department setting.

We found a significant association between methamphetamine concentration and plasma creatinine concentration. This warrants further investigation. Creatinine is a product of normal protein metabolism, which is secreted by the kidneys, and the concentration in the blood is an accurate marker of kidney function. A recent cohort of patients with reported methamphetamine exposure supported by positive urine drug screening were evaluated by Isoardi et al. with 12% (73/595) of cases having a raised creatinine concentration. They found the acute kidney injury in such patients was mild, short‐lived and resolved with intravenous fluid therapy. These findings are closely matched with our cohort.

Urine toxicology screening federal workplace cut-off values — this table reports initial immunoassay and confirmatory GCMS thresholds (ng/mL), confirmatory test analytes, and typical detection periods after the last dose. Marijuana metabolites have initial and confirmatory cutoffs of 50 and 15 ng/mL (THCA) with detection 2–8 days for single use and 20–30 days for chronic use. Cocaine metabolites have 300 and 150 ng/mL (benzoylecgonine) with detection 1–3 days. Opioid metabolites list 2000 and 2000 ng/mL with confirmatory analytes Codeine, Morphine, 6-MAM and detection noted as 2–3 days (opiates), 3–5 minutes (heroin), and 12–24 hr (6-MAM). Amphetamines show 500 and 250 ng/mL with analytes Amphetamine, Methamphetamine, MDMA, MDA, MDEA and 1–3 day detection, while Methamphetamine has incomplete initial data, confirmatory 500 ng/mL, and 3–4 day detection. Benzodiazepines list 300 and 200 ng/mL with 3 days (short-acting) and 30 days (long-acting) detection, and Barbiturates list 300 and 200 ng/mL with 1 day (short-acting) and 21 days (long-acting) detection. Methadone lists 300 and 200 ng/mL with EDDP and 3–6 day detection, and Alcohol is listed with EtG, EtS and 12 hours detection. A footnote states 'Detection time for most drugs in urine is 1–3 days', and another notes that opiate testing levels were raised from 300 ng/mL to 2000 ng/mL to reduce detection from foods containing poppy seeds.

### Rational urine drug monitoring in patients receiving opioids for chronic pain: consensus recommendations [^1161517b]. Pain Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion and Recommendations

Question 1: Which UDM Test(s) Should Be Used and in Which Patients Prescribed Opioids for Chronic Pain Should the Tests Be Used According to a Medical Literature Review, Clinical Experience, Clinical Chemistry of Drug Testing, and Practical Considerations?

Expert Panel Recommendations

Use definitive UDM testing (e.g. with GC-MS, LC-MS, or LC-MS/MS) as the most accurate method for assessing baseline opioid use and opioid misuse in almost all patients with chronic pain being considered for opioids as well as for ongoing monitoring of patients receiving opioids for chronic pain, unless presumptive testing is required by institutional or payer policies. A rational approach to choosing the most relevant analytes (i.e. substances to be tested) for UDM testing is proposed (in the Expert Panel Discussion section for question 1) and should be documented by the clinician.

Existing Guidelines

In contrast to this expert panel's recommendation, previously published guidelines suggest that patients undergo presumptive testing with immunoassay when they are prescribed opioids for chronic pain; some guidelines specify that the test should be POC. Confirmatory definitive tests are generally reserved for resolving unexpected results from immunoassays or for detecting specific opioids that cannot be identified with standard immunoassays. According to the CDC, CMS, and other payer policies, definitive testing is appropriate only when it affects clinical decision-making and patient management. The Washington State guidelines suggest considering the following drugs for a UDM panel in addition to medications prescribed: alcohol, amphetamines, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, cannabinoids, cocaine, fentanyl, methadone, opiates, and oxycodone.

### Double-blind placebo-controlled evaluation of the PROMETA ™ protocol for methamphetamine dependence [^117JVmWw]. Addiction (2012). Low credibility.

Aims

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of the PROMETA™ Protocol for treating methamphetamine dependence.

Design

A double-blind, placebo-controlled 108-day study with random assignment to one of two study conditions: active medication with flumazenil (2 mg infusions on days 1, 2, 3, 22, 23), gabapentin (1200 mg to day 40) and hydroxazine (50 mg to day 10) versus placebo medication (with active hydroxazine only).

Setting

Three substance abuse treatment clinics: two in-patient, one out-patient.

Participants

Treatment-seeking, methamphetamine-dependent adults (n = 120).

Measurements

Primary outcome was percentage of urine samples testing negative for methamphetamine during the trial.

Findings

No statistically significant between-group differences were detected in urine drug test results, craving, treatment retention or adverse events.

Conclusions

The PROMETA protocol, consisting of flumazenil, gabapentin and hydroxyzine, appears to be no more effective than placebo in reducing methamphetamine use, retaining patients in treatment or reducing methamphetamine craving.

### The cyclical and evolving nature of methamphetamine use: an evaluation of near real-time urine drug test results [^117LvCXQ]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Statistical Analysis

Logistic regression was performed to evaluate the association of demographic features with methamphetamine detection. Collection year, clinic location (US census division), sex, age (discretized into 18–24, 25–34, 35–44, 45–54, 55–64, and > 65-year-olds), and health care specialty were modeled as explanatory variables. Health care specialty is a 6-level categorization designed to describe the clinical practice of the ordering physician. Specialty classification was initially chosen by Millennium Health and subsequently verified by the ordering HCP. Health care specialty was added as a potentially confounding covariate in the regression model to account for potential changes in the sample. An interaction term for collection year and US census division was included to help better understand the changing nature of methamphetamine use over time and across divisions. Type-III analysis of deviance was performed to evaluate significance of each model factor using likelihood ratio tests. Least square mean predictions (marginal probabilities) for all factors in the logistic model were estimated along with Sidak-corrected 95% confidence interval (CI) values. Tukey-corrected P values were calculated for each factor level comparison.

Regression models were also constructed for the nonmethamphetamine drugs and drug classes tested. In addition to collection year, US census division, sex, age, and health care specialty, the detection status of methamphetamine (positive or negative) was added as an explanatory variable to each of the nine independent models. Detection status of the given drug class was treated as the dependent variable. A 3-way interaction term for collection year, US census division, and methamphetamine detection were included in the model to better understand spatio-temporal drug copositivity patterns in the methamphetamine population. Adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and Sidak-corrected 95% CIs for the detection status of methamphetamine were estimated for each year and census division. The aOR represents the odds of being positive for a given drug class in the methamphetamine-positive population compared to the odds in the methamphetamine-negative population. This aOR was used to determine if methamphetamine detection status was correlated with detection of a given drug class across years and census divisions. A Mann-Kendall correlation test was used to look for statistically significant increasing or decreasing trends in the aOR over time.

R statistical software version 3.5.0 (R Project for Statistical Computing) was used for data analysis. Statistical significance was set at P less than 0.05, and all tests were 2-tailed.

### Topiramate for the treatment of methamphetamine addiction: a multi-center placebo-controlled trial [^114rpZou]. Addiction (2012). Low credibility.

Aims

Topiramate has shown efficacy at facilitating abstinence from alcohol and cocaine abuse. This double-blind, placebo-controlled out-patient trial tested topiramate for treating methamphetamine addiction.

Design

Participants (n = 140) were randomized to receive topiramate or placebo (13 weeks) in escalating doses from 25 mg/day [DOSAGE ERROR CORRECTED] to the target maintenance of 200mg/day in weeks 6–12 (tapered in week 13). Medication was combined with weekly brief behavioral compliance enhancement treatment.

Setting

The trial was conducted at eight medical centers in the United States.

Participants

One hundred and forty methamphetamine-dependent adults took part in the trial.

Measurements

The primary outcome was abstinence from methamphetamine during weeks 6–12. Secondary outcomes included use reduction versus baseline, as well as psychosocial variables.

Findings

In the intent-to-treat analysis, topiramate did not increase abstinence from methamphetamine during weeks 6–12. For secondary outcomes, topiramate reduced weekly median urine methamphetamine levels and observer-rated severity of dependence scores significantly. Subjects with negative urine before randomization (n = 26) had significantly greater abstinence on topiramate versus placebo during study weeks 6–12. Topiramate was safe and well tolerated.

Conclusions

Topiramate does not appear to promote abstinence in methamphetamine users but can reduce the amount taken and reduce relapse rates in those who are already abstinent.

### Methamphetamine-related burns in the cornbelt [^113ty96J]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2008). Low credibility.

Methamphetamine (MA) is a highly addictive drug that is easily manufactured from everyday household products and chemicals found at local farm stores. The proliferation of small MA labs has led to a dramatic increase in patients sustaining thermal injury while making and/or using MA. We hypothesized that these patients have larger injuries with longer hospital stays, and larger, nonreimbursed hospital bills compared with burn patients not manufacturing or using MA. In a retrospective case-control study, all burn patients ≥ 16 years of age admitted to our burn center from January 2002 to December 2005 were stratified into two groups based on urine MA status. Of the 660 burn patients ≥ 16 years of age admitted during this 4 year period, urine drug screens were obtained at admission on 410 patients (62%); 10% of urine drug screens were MA (+). MA (+) patients have larger burns compared with MA (-) patients (9.3 vs 8.6% body surface area burns), have higher rates of inhalation injuries (20.4 vs 9.3%, P = .015), and more nonthermal trauma (13.0 vs 3.1%, P = .001). When compared with MA (-) patients, MA (+) patients require longer hospital stays (median 9.5 vs 7.0 days, P = .036), accrue greater hospital bills per day (dollars 4292 vs dollars 2797, P = .01), and lack medical insurance (66.7 vs 17.7%, P < .0001). The epidemic of MA use and its manufacture mandates that burn centers monitor patients for MA use and develop and institute protocols to ensure proper care of this increasingly costly population.

### The cyclical and evolving nature of methamphetamine use: an evaluation of near real-time urine drug test results [^116s93S5]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Methamphetamine Usage

A logistic regression model of methamphetamine detection, including collection year, US census division, sex, age, and health care specialty as explanatory factors, was highly significant (X 2 = 121,595, df = 64, LRT P = < 2.2e-16, McFadden Pseudo-R 2 = 0.81, Table 2). The marginal predicted probability of being positive for methamphetamine increased from 0.010 [0.010–0.011] in 2014 to 0.044 [0.042–0.046] in 2019, a 340% increase in total US methamphetamine positivity over 6 years. Notably, predicted detection ranged from 0.064 [0.062–0.066] for the West North Central division to 0.007 [0.006–0.008] for the New England division, indicating a wide range of geographical methamphetamine positivity during the study period. Age significantly impacted methamphetamine, with 25- to 34-year-old patients showing the highest predicted positivity. Males were found to have a slightly higher methamphetamine positivity rate than females; however, it was not significant. Patient specimens from SUD treatment centers had the highest predicted positivity (0.050 [0.049–0.051]) and OB/GYN specimens the lowest (0.008 [0.008–0.009]).

TABLE 2
Logistic Regression Results for Methamphetamine Detection

The interaction term for collection year and census division in the model was found to be significant, leading to an evaluation of the predicted methamphetamine detection probabilities across divisions and years (Fig. 1, Table 2). The significant interaction suggests that not all divisions are changing at the same rate. For example, positivity in the East South Central division is increasing rapidly and surpassed both the Mountain and West South Central divisions after 2018. The East South Central division had the third highest positivity in 2019 and could surpass the West North Central and Pacific divisions in 2020 if similar trends remain in effect. While the East North Central, South Atlantic, New England, and Mid Atlantic divisions remain lower than the national average, they all continue to increase at similar rates, suggesting that methamphetamine is growing in most divisions of the country (Table 2, Fig. 1).

### The cyclical and evolving nature of methamphetamine use: an evaluation of near real-time urine drug test results [^113kqrMc]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To determine methamphetamine positivity and copositivity with other drugs in urine drug test (UDT) results geographically through time.

Methods

This cross-sectional study of UDT results from January 1, 2014, through December 31, 2019, included patient specimens submitted by health care professionals across the United States. The analysis used LC-MS/MS to detect cocaine, heroin, alcohol, marijuana and nonprescribed methamphetamine, fentanyl, methadone, buprenorphine, benzodiazepines, and other opioids. Logistic regression was used to evaluate association of demographic features and model yearly methamphetamine detection patterns across US census divisions. Odds ratios (OR) from logistic modeling were used to evaluate the impact of methamphetamine positivity on the spatio-temporal detection patterns of additional nonprescribed or illicit drugs.

Results

The probability of being positive for methamphetamine increased nationally from 0.010 [0.010–0.011] in 2014 to 0.044 [0.042–0.046] in 2019, a 340% increase after correction for demographic covariates. The highest predicted positivity rate was in male patients, 25- to 34-years-old, from the West North Central division and from substance use disorder treatment centers. Nationally, copositivity ORs for fentanyl, heroin, and other opioids with methamphetamine were highest in 2019. Increases in ORs from 2014 through 2019 were statistically significant for heroin (P = 0.024) and fentanyl (P = 0.0085). Copositivity ORs for methamphetamine and other substances varied by census division.

Conclusions

The probability of being positive for methamphetamine in UDT increased nationwide between 2014 and 2019. Not all census divisions are increasing at the same rate. Copositivity with additional substances is increasing in some census divisions, which further increases the risk of overdose and poor treatment outcomes.

### Non-contact identification and differentiation of illicit drugs using fluorescent films [^112cTsE6]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Modern optical or electrical technology-based vapor detection techniques have been expected to work instead of sniffer dogs –. As an example, hidden explosive detection via vapor phase sensing has been realized by using ion-mobility and fluorescence techniques –. Compared with other known methods, film-based fluorescence sensing possesses several unique advantages, such as great designability, outstanding sensitivity, reusability, and low cost. Because of such reasons, research in the field has achieved great progress during the last few decades –. Studies in the detection of illicit drugs with this technology, especially in vapor phase, however, are limited. Cheng and co-workers,– reported several fluorescence methods for the detection of methamphetamine (MAPA) and ketamine, and the lowest detection limit (DL) in vapor phase of MAPA is ~180 ppb, and 50 pg cm −2 for ketamine in aqueous phase. Recently, Pavel and co-workers, reported a supramolecular sensor array composed of fluorescent cucurbit[n]uril-type receptors, which enables the detection of pseudo-ephedrine and opiates as well as their metabolites in human urine. The DLs of the detections are lower than those reported for solid phase extraction-high-performance liquid chromatography. Based on the same principle, Kim and co-workersreported a strategy that combines the selectivity of supramolecular chemistry and the sensitivity of organic field-effect transistors to detect MAPA at a low concentration (~1 nM) in human urine. Reviriego et al.discovered that the sodium salt of diethyl-1 H -pyrazole - 3,5-dicarboxylate could function as a receptor of MAPA. Based upon this finding, they designed a sensitive fluorescence sensor for MAPA, amphetamine, and ecstasy in solution phase. Recently, wereported a fluorescent sensor for MAPA and its simulant, N- methyl-phenethylamine, which shows a DL of ~5.5 ppb in vapor phase. However, all the reports either have their own limitations, as types of drugs detected are limited, or the studies remain at a principle level.

### Lisdexamfetamine in the treatment of methamphetamine dependence: a randomised, placebo-controlled trial [^116hKaRK]. Addiction (2025). Medium credibility.

Measurements

Primary outcome

The primary efficacy measure was the between‐group difference in the number of days of self‐reported methamphetamine use in the past 28 days at the end of the 12‐week maintenance period (Weeks 9–13) using the time‐line follow back questionnaire (TLFB).

Secondary outcomes

Secondary measures related to methamphetamine use were: total number of days of self‐reported methamphetamine use during the 12‐week treatment period (possible range = 0–84 days); mean longest period of abstinence during treatment period; percentage abstinent on self‐report for 21 days or greater; percentage of methamphetamine‐negative urine tests over 12 weeks (one a week, with missing tests considered positive), and in the last 4 weeks of the 12‐week treatment period (of a total of four, with missing tests imputed as positive). The TLFB was administered at baseline (Day 1, Week 1, first dose), Week 5, Week 9, the primary end‐point of Week 13 and at follow‐up to Week 19, and self‐reported abstinence was confirmed by urine test.

Other measures

Other secondary measures administered at baseline and Weeks 5, 9, 13 (primary end‐point) and 19 (follow‐up) included: Visual Analog Scale for Craving, Amphetamine Withdrawal Questionnaire, Severity of Dependence Scale, TLFB for other substance use, Insomnia Severity Index, Drug Effects Questionnaire, Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scales‐21 (DASS‐21), Patient Health Questionnaire‐15 (PHQ‐15), World Health Organization's Quality of Life Brief version assessment (WHOQOL‐BREF), treatment retention, the Opioid Treatment Index — injecting (OTI‐I) and criminal behaviour (OTI‐C) and Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medicines (TQSM). The Wender‐Utah Rating Scale (WURS) to screen for childhood ADHD and the Enriched Social Support Index (ESSI) as a measure of social support were administered at baseline, together with demographic data (Table 1).

TABLE 1
Participant characteristics.

Adverse events

Adverse events were classified according to the preferred term and system organ class of the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities, version 24.1 and evaluated for seriousness, severity and relatedness to study medication by site principal investigators, who were blinded to group allocation. Serious adverse events were evaluated for relatedness by the trial Chairperson (coordinating principal investigator), who was also blinded to group allocation. All adverse event data (and their group allocation) were reviewed by the IDSMC.

### Appropriate use of drug testing in clinical addiction medicine [^111HuaQD]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Random testing — preference and implementation notes that whatever the frequency, clinical consensus favors unannounced drug testing over scheduled drug testing, because a fixed schedule (e.g., every Monday) offers patients increased opportunity to engage in sample tampering, and even when frequency is within a test's normal window of detection (e.g., a urine immunoassay screen for amphetamines every Monday and Thursday) it is possible for a patient to engage in substance use on Thursday night and not produce a positive result on Monday morning. The purest form of randomization is to have a set probability (e.g., 15%) that a patient could be tested on any given day, which is akin to rolling a die every day and testing whenever a 6 appears; while this eliminates known safe periods, the length of time a patient may go between testing can be quite long, and many addiction treatment providers randomly select a day from a fixed interval.

### Temporal trends in methamphetamine use in patients admitted to the hospital: a retrospective cohort study [^113vbVC1]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Although methamphetamine use is common, the scope of methamphetamine use and outcomes for patients admitted to the hospital is unclear. This study aims to identify the prevalence of methamphetamine use from January 2012 to January 2022, coingestions, hospital course, and readmission rate of admitted patients.

Methods

This was a retrospective cohort study conducted on patients admitted to our center with the following inclusions: age older than 18 years, positive/"pending confirm" value for methamphetamine on urine drug screen, and/or an International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, code related to stimulant use disorder as an active issue. Urine drug screen data are reported as methamphetamine ± and polysubstance (PS) ±. Patient demographics, admission diagnosis, and hospital course were extracted. Statistical tests used included t tests and Mann-Whitney U tests.

Results

A total of 19,159 encounters were included, representing 12,057 unique patients. The median (interquartile range) age was 43 (33–54) years. Of all encounters, 35.3% were methamphetamine + and PS -, and 46.3% were methamphetamine + and PS +. Hospitalizations increased from 883 in 2012 to 2532 in 2021. The median (IQR) hospital stay was 48 (48–120) hours. Of all encounters, 16.8% included an intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and the median ICU stay was 42 (21–87) hours. A total of 2988 patients (24.7%) were readmitted within the study period, and 4988 (71.5%) returned within 1 year of the previous encounter. In context of all emergency department admissions from 2013 to 2022, 13.1% had a urine drug screen + for methamphetamine.

Conclusions

Hospitalizations with recent methamphetamine use doubled at our institution from 2012 to 2022. In addition, 1 in 4 is readmitted (typically within 1 year), and a minority requires ICU care.

### Trends in self-reported and biochemically verified cocaine and methamphetamine use among pregnant individuals in Northern California, 2011–2019 [^114SagWS]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Discussion

This study found that, consistent with population-level increases in the prevalence of cocaine and methamphetamine use in the general US population, rates of cocaine use increased modestly among pregnant individuals in KPNC. Although the adjusted prevalence was higher across years by self-report vs toxicology tests, likely reflecting screening for any use since pregnancy vs current use, rates increased faster via toxicology tests. In contrast, rates of prenatal methamphetamine use decreased slightly over time via self-report and did not change via toxicology tests. Although prenatal methamphetamine use was nearly twice as prevalent as prenatal cocaine use in 2011, prevalence rates were similar by 2019. Across years, the adjusted prevalence of cocaine and methamphetamine use was roughly twice as high when including data from self-report and toxicology tests vs either measure on its own, indicating that the combination of both methods may lead to the best identification.

This study was limited to insured patients in Northern California screened for stimulant use during pregnancy. Results do not capture the amount or frequency of use, continued prenatal use, or stimulant use disorders. We are not able to differentiate prenatal use that occurred before vs after pregnancy recognition. Stimulants are detectable via urine 2 to 4 days after a single use but can be detectable longer with long-term use, and some individuals may be misclassified as nonusers. Results may not be generalizable to other states or individuals without health care.

Rates of cocaine use during early pregnancy increased modestly from 2011 to 2019 and likely reflect changes in continuation of prepregnancy use into pregnancy. Differing trends in prenatal cocaine and methamphetamine use highlight the importance of early screening for different types of prenatal illicit stimulant use, assessment of substance use disorder, and linkage to nonpunitive treatment, as needed. Research indicates that stopping stimulant use during pregnancy improves birth outcomes, and continued research is needed to understand factors associated with different types of prenatal stimulant use over time.

INTRODUCTION

Globally, increased availability and use of methamphetamine has been associated with greater rates of regular use and associated harms, with a similar pattern reported in Australia. Oral fluid testing is used in occupational and policing settings due to adverse impacts of methamphetamine use on driving and injury risk. The use of oral fluid to detect illicit drug use has expanded over the past decade, particularly for roadside drug testing. Oral fluid testing has also increasingly been used to assess substance use and related harms in select populations (e.g. occupational settings), drug treatment attendees and entertainment event patrons.

In Australia (2019–20), amphetamines were the second most common principal drug of concern for the fourth consecutive year, accounting for more than one‐third of all treatment episodes. Clinicians treating clients using methamphetamine often rely upon client self‐report of recent use, because more objective tests of recent use (e.g. formal confirmative quantitative analysis in blood, urine, saliva or oral fluid) or longer‐term use (hair samples) may be unavailable, inconvenient, costly or have a long lag time in reporting results. Urine and oral fluid testing are the most practical due to non‐invasive sample collection, although urine collection is more inconvenient, and each method has limitations in technical execution and interpretation of results. Liquid chromatography coupled with single‐stage or tandem mass spectrometry is the gold standard method for quantification in clinical and forensic toxicology.

The use of oral fluid to detect methamphetamine is well established in various clinical settings and may be more sensitive than urine detection. However, usefulness is limited in non‐clinical populations with low prevalence of drug use. Single‐stage or tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS, LC–MS/MS) of oral fluid samples has several advantages (sample volumes, time and cost) over gas chromatography procedures and are becoming increasingly important in routine analysis, despite several technical limitations. Some LC–MS procedures for detecting methamphetamine in oral fluid are particularly time‐efficient and adequately sensitive. The study assay has been successfully used for analysis of oral fluid for law enforcement procedures, forensic results and epidemiological prevalence in the relevant populations. The fast and reliable detection of a broad range of drugs and subsequent automated data processing provides the opportunity for high throughput and fast turnaround times for forensic toxicology.

Urine sample tampering — signs and response — indicates that all urine samples should be checked for unusual specimen characteristics, including temperature outside the expected range of 90–100 degrees within 4 minutes of production and unusual color or smell, soapy appearance, cloudiness or particles in the liquid. If a urine sample exhibits unusual specimen characteristics, the sample should undergo specimen validity testing to help identify whether and how tampering occurred, and providers should consider samples that have been tampered with to be presumptive positive.

### Appropriate use of drug testing in clinical addiction medicine [^112ATx2J]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Urine detection window and sample integrity — It takes approximately 2 hours after use for a substance to be detected in urine, and the window of detection for most substances of interest is 1–3 days and up to 4 days in some cases, with duration dependent on factors such as fluid intake and urinary pH. Urine is the specimen most prone to sample tampering, and UDT can be circumvented through sample substitution, dilution and adulteration. A substituted sample replaces the patient's urine with another sample, either urine or some other liquid; diluting a urine sample makes it less likely that a drug or its metabolite(s) can be detected above the cutoff threshold of an immunoassay test; and adulteration uses a masking agent that destroys the presence of drugs in urine or interferes with the enzymatic reactivity of an immunoassay test.

### Rate of fentanyl positivity among urine drug test results positive for cocaine or methamphetamine [^116gNW35]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Importance

Drug overdose deaths continue to increase, despite the leveling off of prescription opioid use and policy changes limiting opioid prescribing. Illicit fentanyl is the leading cause of drug overdose death, and it is important to characterize the emerging combination of other illicit drugs with fentanyl, which increases the risk of overdose.

Objective

To determine whether rates of the combination of nonprescribed fentanyl with cocaine or methamphetamine have changed in urine drug test (UDT) results through time.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cross-sectional study of UDT results from January 1, 2013, through September 30, 2018, included patient specimens submitted for UDTs by health care professionals as part of routine care. Patients were selected from health care practices across the United States, including substance use disorder treatment centers, pain management practices, primary care practices, behavioral health practices, obstetrics and gynecology practices, and multispecialty groups. The UDT analysis used liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry to detect benzoylecgonine (cocaine metabolite), methamphetamine, fentanyl, and norfentanyl. Specimens from individuals reported to have been prescribed fentanyl were excluded. A convenience sample approach was used to randomly select 1 million unique patient UDT specimens from Millennium Health's UDT database for further analysis. Each specimen had associated cocaine, methamphetamine, and fentanyl UDT results.

Exposures

Medically necessary UDT to detect benzoylecgonine (cocaine metabolite), methamphetamine, fentanyl, and norfentanyl, ordered by a health care professional as part of routine patient care.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Rates of nonprescribed fentanyl positivity among cocaine- or methamphetamine-positive UDT results, quantified through time.

Results

In a sampling of 1 million unique patients' UDT specimens analyzed for cocaine and fentanyl (median [interquartile range] age, 44 [19–69] years; 55.0% women), positivity rates for nonprescribed fentanyl among the cocaine-positive results increased significantly, from 0.9% (n = 84) (95% CI, 0.7%-1.1%) in 2013 to 17.6% (n = 427) (95% CI, 16.1%-19.1%) in 2018, a 1850% increase (τ = 0.78; z = 9.45; P < .001). In the same sampling of 1 million specimens, positivity rates for nonprescribed fentanyl among the methamphetamine-positive results also increased significantly, from 0.9% (n = 29) (95% CI, 0.6%-1.2%) in 2013 to 7.9% (n = 344) (95% CI, 7.1%-8.7%) in 2018, a 798% increase (τ = 0.72; z = 8.75; P < .001).

Conclusions and Relevance

An increasing number of UDT results positive for cocaine or methamphetamine were also positive for nonprescribed fentanyl. This provides additional insight into recently reported increases in cocaine- and methamphetamine-related overdoses. Stimulant users who may be opioid naive are at a heightened risk of overdose when exposed to fentanyl. Clinicians need to be aware that patients presenting for treatment of suspected drug overdose or substance use disorder may have been exposed, knowingly or unknowingly, to multiple substances, including the combination of stimulants and opioids.

### Is methamphetamine blood concentration in emergency department patients associated with the clinical picture? [^115ckt49]. Addiction (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Methamphetamine (methylamphetamine) is the second most commonly used illicit drug worldwide, after cannabis, with an estimated 367 tons seized by police globally in 2022. It is the predominant amphetamine‐type stimulant used in North America, Australia and New Zealand, East and South‐East Asia and Southern Africa. Methamphetamine causes sustained release of dopamine, norepinephrine (noradrenaline) and serotonin neurotransmitters and inhibits both their metabolism by monoamine oxidase and their reuptake by monoamine transporters.

The use of methamphetamine has been associated with symptoms of psychosis in several ways. Historical studies in small numbers of patients administered amphetamine or methamphetamine under controlled conditions demonstrated that a significant proportion developed psychotic symptoms acutely. However, repeated exposure to methamphetamine over time is also a risk for psychosis. McKetin et al. reported an association between the number of days of patient exposure to methamphetamine in the past month and the odds of psychosis, with 48% of patients with 16 or more days of methamphetamine exposure exhibiting psychotic symptoms.

Patients with methamphetamine intoxication are commonly seen in the emergency department. A recent study reported 71% of emergency department patients with suspected methamphetamine intoxication were exhibiting psychotic symptoms. The concentration of methamphetamine in the blood is not routinely measured in these patients. It has not previously been determined if there is a dose–response association with physiological parameters, laboratory results, clinical features or the presence of psychotic symptoms.

This study describes a cohort of 431 presentations to an emergency department with analytically confirmed methamphetamine exposure. Primary aims were to determine the concentration of methamphetamine in the blood, to test the association between concentration and physiological and laboratory parameters, symptoms and signs including psychotic symptoms, and to describe clinical outcomes in the emergency department and hospital.

### A randomized, placebo-controlled trial of sustained-release dextroamphetamine for treatment of methamphetamine addiction [^115n2wT8]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2011). Low credibility.

Sixty treatment-seeking individuals with methamphetamine (MA) dependence entered a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial of oral dextroamphetamine (d-AMP) as a replacement therapy for MA dependence. The subjects took 60 mg sustained-release d-AMP for 8 weeks, during which time they received eight 50-min sessions of individual psychotherapy. Adverse events and urine toxicology for MA were assessed two times a week. There were no serious adverse events. Urine samples containing < 1,000 ng/ml of MA were classified as negative for MA. The MA-negative scores in the d-AMP group (3.1 ± SD 4.6) were no higher than those in the placebo group (3.3 ± SD 5.3; P > 0.05). However, withdrawal and craving scores were significantly lower in the d-AMP group (P < 0.05 for both). Although subjects taking d-AMP did not reduce their use of MA, the significant reductions observed in withdrawal and craving scores in this group support the need for further exploration of d-AMP as a pharmacologic intervention for MA dependence, possibly at higher doses.

### The bioavailability of intranasal and smoked methamphetamine [^116xmSXv]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Patients in harm-reduction treatment programs are switching from intravenous to other routes of methamphetamine (INN, metamfetamine) administration to avoid risks associated with needle use. Relatively little has been reported about the bioavailability of methamphetamine when smoked or used intranasally.

Methods

Eight experienced methamphetamine users were administered smoked or intranasal methamphetamine concurrently with an intravenous dose of deuterium-labeled methamphetamine. Plasma and urine concentrations were measured for calculation of bioavailability and other pharmacokinetic parameters by noncompartmental methods.

Results

Methamphetamine was well absorbed after smoking or intranasal administration, with bioavailabilities of 79% after intranasal administration and 67% of the estimated delivered dose or 37.4% of the absolute (pipe) dose after smoking. Maximum methamphetamine concentrations occurred at 2.7 and 2.5 hours after intranasal and smoked doses. The elimination half-life was similar for intravenous (11.4 hours), intranasal (10.7 hours), and smoked (10.7 hours) methamphetamine. Clearance (272 mL x h(-1) x kg(-1)), steady-state volume of distribution (4.2 L/kg), and mean residence time (16 hours) of the intravenous dose were similar to previously reported values. Dextroamphetamine (INN, dexamfetamine) half-life (all routes) was 16.2 hours. Methamphetamine and dextroamphetamine renal clearances (all routes) were about 100 and 1100 mL x h(-1) x kg(-1), respectively.

Conclusions

Intranasal and smoked methamphetamine are well absorbed. Although intranasal or smoked routes may decrease the risk of transmission of blood-borne diseases, exposure to methamphetamine and the possibility of drug-related complications remain substantial.

### The cyclical and evolving nature of methamphetamine use: an evaluation of near real-time urine drug test results [^113W6N8V]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

These data indicate a 340% nationwide increase between 2014 and 2019 in probability for methamphetamine-positivity in UDT after model adjustment. The highest predicted positivity rate was in male patients, 25- to 34-years-old, from the West North Central division and from SUD treatment centers. Although the West North Central division had the highest predicted methamphetamine positivity in 2019, positivity for the East South Central is rapidly rising and may surpass the West North Central and Pacific divisions in 2020.

These findings are concerning for several reasons. Methamphetamine use can have severe consequences for the user, resulting in short-term and long-term health effects, including overdose and death. Because of stimulation of cardiovascular and central nervous systems, use may lead to heart attack or stroke. Methamphetamine overdose may result in increased body temperature and convulsions, which when left untreated, may result in death. Unfortunately, treating a methamphetamine overdose is challenging because there is no specific antidote, as is the case for opioids with the opioid antagonist naloxone. With acute intoxication, in which the user may be experiencing agitation and psychotic symptoms, supportive measures are often used, including placing the patient in a calm, quiet space and use of a benzodiazepine or antipsychotic.

### Appropriate use of drug testing in clinical addiction medicine [^1169FZun]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Principles of biological detection of substance use — drug tests provide information on substance presence in a collected specimen and answer the narrow question, "is substance X detected in sample Y?" A yes is labeled "positive" and no is "negative", and a positive result indicates the patient had a detectable amount of targeted substance(s) when the sample was collected. The timing of collection is important because elimination varies by biological sample type (matrix), and even the most effective test can only measure presence within the window of detection. A positive test is not sufficient evidence for an SUD diagnosis, does not explain whether symptoms are caused by a substance, and in most cases does not measure impairment or patterns of use over time.

### Methamphetamine-associated pulseless electrical activity in a young child [^111y3x5j]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

This is a case report of a 19-month-old female who presented to the emergency department in cardiac arrest after methamphetamine exposure. Prior to presentation, she had seizure-like activity and then became unresponsive. On arrival, she had dilated pupils, intermittent clonus, and pulseless electrical activity. She was found to have full thickness circumferential burns of her bilateral lower extremities. She received 12 doses of epinephrine, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and volume resuscitation after which she had return of spontaneous circulation and was transferred to the intensive care unit on an epinephrine drip. Initial laboratory studies showed a mixed metabolic and respiratory acidosis and hyperglycemia. An initial urine immunoassay for drugs of abuse was negative, however, 5 h later, a second urine immunoassay was positive for amphetamine. The first specimen was also sent for liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis that later returned positive for methamphetamine and amphetamine. In retrospect, the initial urine screen was found to have evidence of amphetamine below the threshold for positivity (500 ng/mL), and the second urine specimen was highly positive, with an amphetamine level of > 1450 ng/mL. In this case, what turned out to be a sub-threshold rather than undetectable level was clinically significant, highlighting the challenges of urine screening in cases of suspected poisoning syndromes with atypical presentations. Our case also suggests the possibility of PEA as a presentation of methamphetamine toxicity in a child.

### Dropout in clinical trials of pharmacological treatment for methamphetamine dependence: the role of initial abstinence [^115qYz9Q]. Addiction (2017). Low credibility.

Background and Aims

High rates of loss to follow-up represent a significant challenge to clinical trials of pharmacological treatments for methamphetamine (MA) use disorder. We aimed to estimate and test the relationship between achieving and maintaining abstinence in the initial weeks of study participation and subsequent retention in such trials, hypothesizing that participants able to achieve early abstinence would be less likely to drop out.

Design

Data from four randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of pharmacological treatments for MA use disorder were pooled and analyzed using a random-effects approach.

Setting

All trials were conducted in the greater Los Angeles, CA, USA area.

Participants

A total of 440 participants were included; trials were conducted between 2004 and 2014.

Measurements

Participants' ability to achieve a brief period of initial abstinence was measured as the number of MA-negative urine screens completed in the first 2 weeks of the trials. Outcomes were the likelihood of dropout, i.e. missing two consecutive weeks of scheduled urine drug screens, and the number of days participants were retained in the trials.

Findings

Study participants achieved an average of three (of six possible) negative urine screens during the first 2 weeks of the trials, 51% dropped out and the average number of days retained was 60 (of 90 maximum). Each additional negative urine screen achieved during the first 2 weeks of the study reduced multiplicatively the odds of dropout by 41% [odds ratio (OR) = 0.59, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.53, 0.66]. Abstinence was also a significant predictor of retention time; the hazard ratio for non-completion was 0.75 per additional negative urine screen (95% CI = 0.71, 0.80).

Conclusions

Participants in randomized controlled trials of pharmacological treatments for methamphetamine use disorder who are able to achieve a brief period of early abstinence are retained longer in the trials and are less likely to drop out overall.

### Appropriate use of drug testing in clinical addiction medicine [^114kGhv3]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Oral fluid testing in addiction treatment offers a shorter window of detection than urine (12–48 hours for most substances) and is unobtrusively collected. Oral fluid is collected with an absorbent pad that is held in the mouth for 30 to 60 seconds before placement in a container, and oral fluid collection with a device such as a pad is preferable to direct expectoration into a container. Providers should encourage patients to abstain from eating for 15 to 60 minutes prior to sample collection. If a patient recently took a drug by mouth (ingestion or inhalation), it is recommended that practitioners wait at least 2 hours before collecting an oral fluid sample. Because oral ingestion can leave very high concentrations in the mouth, it can be difficult to correlate concentration and intoxication for a period of about 2 hours after dosing. Small oral fluid sample volumes mean there may not be enough specimen available for analysis and prevents retesting of the same sample for validity or subsequent definitive testing.

### Appropriate use of drug testing in clinical addiction medicine [^112thHkU]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Urine drug testing (UDT) in addiction treatment — At this time, urine is the most well-established and well-supported biological matrix for presumptive detection of substance use in addiction treatment settings, and urine is the most commonly used biological specimen for drug and alcohol testing in clinical settings. UDT is described as a mature technology with many testing options available, generally at lower cost compared to other matrices. However, there are 2 major drawbacks to UDT: the ease of sample tampering through substitution, dilution, and adulteration, and the invasiveness and resource intensity of witnessed sample collection. If appropriate measures to reduce urine sample tampering are not able to be taken and tampering is of high concern, providers should consider testing an alternative specimen, and the use of alternative matrices to complement UDT could occur clinic-wide by rotating specimen types or on an individual collection-by-collection basis.

### The NIDA methamphetamine clinical trials group: a strategy to increase clinical trials research capacity [^111SgDWV]. Addiction (2007). Low credibility.

Aims

In order to increase the number of investigative teams and sites conducting research on pharmacological treatments for methamphetamine use disorders, the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) established an infrastructure of clinical sites in areas where methamphetamine addiction is prevalent. This multi-site infrastructure would serve to run multiple Phases II and III protocols effectively and expeditiously.

Methods

NIDA collaborated with investigators from the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) to set up the Methamphetamine Clinical Trials Group (MCTG). This paper describes the development process, as well as data from a test trial to assess the capability of research-naive sites to recruit research participants and conduct study procedures according to research protocol. Subsequent trials are also described.

Results

A total of 151 candidates signed consent; 65 individuals were enrolled and 35 (53.8%) completed the 12 weeks' behavioral trial. Self-reported substance use report (SUR) showed comparable use of methamphetamine across sites with the individual site means ranging from 59% (site 5) to 80% (site 3). Drug use as measured by urinalysis was greatly reduced at week 13 compared to the baseline measure; the average rate of methamphetamine-free urine samples across all participants in sites at week 13 was 53%. The highest percentage of methamphetamine-free samples was 85% at site 5; the lowest was at site 1 (40%). Addiction severity index (ASI) composite scores at baseline and protocol completion for all participants demonstrated improvement in all categories over time, except for the medical composite score. The largest composite score reduction in baseline-protocol completion was in the drug domain (0.23 versus 0.15). The changes in the ASI scores from baseline to week 13 were consistent across all five sites.

Conclusions

Outcomes of the behavioral trial indicated that the MCTG recruited well; collected study data accurately and reliably; and created a vehicle that can assess promising pharmacotherapies for methamphetamine addiction treatment medications. The MCTG strategy appears to be a feasible approach to increase NIDA's capacity to conduct clinical trials to evaluate potential pharmacotherapies for methamphetamine addiction.

### Fentanyl, heroin, methamphetamine, and cocaine analyte concentrations in urine drug testing specimens [^112LWMXv]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Conclusions

This cross-sectional study, to our knowledge, is the largest and most granular assessment of drug use patterns in the US to date. Its findings reveal changes in drug exposure and illicit drug supply over the past decade and highlight the need to reinforce surveillance initiatives and accelerate efforts to effectively treat IMF and/or stimulant exposure. The UDT results from 2013 to 2023 provide objective, biological evidence that persons presenting to treatment for SUD have increasingly higher absolute exposure to fentanyl and methamphetamine, as well as cocaine to a smaller degree, and decreasing exposure to heroin. These concentrations conformed to regional reports on drug use patterns, with IMF replacing heroin throughout most of the country and methamphetamine being most prominent in the Western regions. A concerted research strategy is necessary to lessen the consequences of increased exposure levels in individuals with SUD and to support focused public health and biomedical research efforts to understand and curtail overdoses from the twin opioid-stimulant epidemic.

### The ASAM / AAAP clinical practice guideline on the management of stimulant use disorder [^116ZC16i]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Stimulant use disorder — toxicology testing indications and confirmatory testing are specified for clinical assessment. Patient consent should generally be obtained prior to testing unless there is an immediate clinical need and obtaining consent is not possible (eg, loss of consciousness), and clinicians should stay abreast of which stimulants are prevalent within certain demographics in their region; testing laboratories often track this information. Indications for useful toxicology testing, including screening and confirmatory testing, include but are not limited to when the etiology of signs and symptoms is unclear, the clinical findings are not fully consistent with stimulant intoxication alone (ie, suggestive of other substance exposure), and the information is clinically important (eg, to assess potential pediatric exposure, to differentiate psychiatric decompensation from methamphetamine-associated psychosis). Confirmatory testing should be considered when the findings from a presumptive test are inconsistent with findings in the history or physical exam, and when presumptive testing is not available for a substance that is important to evaluate (eg, fentanyl when co-intoxication with opioids is suspected in a region where fentanyl commonly contaminates the stimulant supply).

### Appropriate use of drug testing in clinical addiction medicine [^111wvn9u]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Urine testing for specific substances — urine is the most well-established and well-supported biologic matrix for conducting drug testing for patients with addiction, but its utility depends on the substance of interest and the information the provider needs. Providers should consider the questions they are seeking to answer when conducting a urine test and be aware of known detection issues; for example, THC is detectable in urine, but it is difficult to distinguish when the substance was used.

### Analysis of urine drug test results from substance use disorder treatment practices and overdose mortality rates, 2013–2020 [^1131XZeB]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Urine Drug Testing

We conducted a retrospective cross-sectional study of UDT results collected from patients between January 1, 2013, and December 31, 2020. Drug testing was ordered by clinicians who specialized in SUD treatment and was based on medical necessity. Ordered UDT results were obtained from all 50 US states. Specimens were analyzed using LC-MS/MS. The LC-MS/MS assays used were laboratory developed, with performance characteristics determined by Millennium Health in San Diego, California. Millennium Health is certified by the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments and accredited for high-complexity testing by the College of American Pathologists. The study protocol was approved by the Aspire Independent Review Board (Santee, California) with a waiver of informed consent because of the use of deidentified data. This study followed the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology reporting guideline for cross-sectional studies.

To align with the National Vital Statistics System (CDC WONDER) multiple cause of death (MCD) mortality files, we selected the following 5 drug categories for analysis (with tested analytes given in parentheses): cocaine (benzoylecgonine), heroin (6-monoacetylmorphine), methamphetamine (methamphetamine), synthetic opioids (fentanyl, N-desmethyl-tramadol, norfentanyl, O-desmethyl-tramadol, and tramadol), and other opioids (codeine, hydrocodone, hydromorphone, morphine, norhydrocodone, noroxycodone, oxycodone, and oxymorphone). If any parent drug or metabolite within a category was detected, the category was considered to have positivity for that specimen. A list of prescribed medications for each study participant was noted on the requisition form by the clinician ordering the UDT. We excluded patients with positive test results for cocaine, fentanyl, methamphetamine, tramadol, or other opioids that were reported by clinicians to be currently prescribed to patients.

A single specimen for each patient 18 years of age or older was selected based on the earliest specimen collection date to remove repeated measurements. A total of 500 000 unique patients from the Millennium Health proprietary UDT database were randomly selected with equal probability, and their data were used for subsequent analyses. Monthly, quarterly, and yearly total UDT positivity rates were calculated for each of the 5 drug categories. Drug positivity rates were further stratified by codetection of synthetic opioids and by the state or county of the patient's residence.

### Does labetalol trigger false positive drug testing results? [^117Vtiiz]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Labetalol, an α- and β-adrenergic antagonist used to treat hypertension in pregnancy has been blamed for causing false-positive amphetamine and methamphetamine results. In this study, we tested 3 concentrations of labetalol prepared with 4 specimen types (urine, plasma, meconium, and umbilical cord tissue), for amphetamine, methamphetamine, and several other drugs with screen and confirmation tests.

Methods

Residual drug-free specimens were pooled. Labetalol hydrochloride dissolved in methanol was used to prepare spikes in triplicate per specimen type (2.7, 50, and 100 μM), which were tested with 41 previously validated drug tests performed by immunoassay or liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).

Results

Labetalol triggered false-positive amphetamine and methamphetamine results by immunoassay in meconium but did not trigger positive results for any of the targeted drugs or drug metabolites tested by LC-MS/MS. No positive results were generated by any immunoassay or LC-MS/MS test included in the study, when challenged with high concentrations of labetalol in urine, plasma, or umbilical cord tissue.

Conclusions

In summary, false-positive results can be generated by labetalol when tested by immunoassay, but false-positive results are not expected when testing is performed by highly specific analytical approaches such as LC-MS/MS.

### Fentanyl, heroin, methamphetamine, and cocaine analyte concentrations in urine drug testing specimens [^116APbup]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Importance

The US is experiencing a protracted drug overdose crisis primarily associated with exposure to illicitly manufactured fentanyl (IMF), methamphetamine, and cocaine. Overdose risk and treatment responses may be directly affected by absolute drug exposure concentrations and drug use prevalence.

Objective

To quantify changes in absolute drug exposure concentrations from 2013 to 2023.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cross-sectional study analyzed urine drug testing (UDT) results from urine specimens collected between January 1, 2013, and August 22, 2023, in 49 states and the District of Columbia. Urine specimens were obtained from patients aged 18 years or older who presented to substance use disorder treatment clinics. The UDT was ordered by clinicians based on medical necessity.

Exposures

Urine specimens were analyzed for the following drugs or metabolites (analytes tested in parentheses): fentanyl (fentanyl), heroin (6-monoacetylmorphine), cocaine (benzoylecgonine), and methamphetamine (methamphetamine) using liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Relative concentrations of fentanyl, heroin, cocaine, and methamphetamine. Creatinine-normalized drug concentration values were log-transformed prior to visualization and statistical analyses. The Mann-Kendall trend test was performed to examine trends over time. To estimate the geospatial and temporal patterns of drug concentration, a second series of models (1 for each drug) with an interaction effect for clinic location and collection year were fit.

Results

A total of 921 931 unique UDT samples were collected from patients (549 042 males [59.6%]; median [IQR] age, 34 [27–44] years). The adjusted fentanyl concentration in urine specimens was 38.23 (95% CI, 35.93–40.67) ng/mg creatinine in 2023 and 4.61 (95% CI, 3.59–5.91) ng/mg creatinine in 2013. The adjusted methamphetamine concentration was 3461.59 (95% CI, 3271.88–3662.30) ng/mg creatinine in 2023 and 665.27 (95% CI, 608.51–727.32) ng/mg creatinine in 2013. The adjusted cocaine concentration was 1122.23 (95% CI, 1032.41–1219.87) ng/mg creatinine in 2023 and 559.71 (95% CI, 524.69–597.06) ng/mg creatinine in 2013. The adjusted heroin concentration was 58.36 (95% CI, 48.26–70.58) ng/mg creatinine in 2023 and 146.59 (95% CI, 136.06–157.92) ng/mg creatinine in 2013. Drug concentrations varied across US Census divisions.

Conclusions and Relevance

This cross-sectional study found that absolute concentrations of fentanyl, methamphetamine, and cocaine in urine specimens increased from 2013 to 2023, with a decrease in heroin concentration during that period. The findings suggest that exposure to these substances, as well as the illicit drug supply, has fundamentally changed in many parts of the US, highlighting the need to reinforce surveillance initiatives and accelerate efforts to treat individuals with IMF and/or stimulant exposure.

2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Administer methamphetamine hydrochloride tablets orally once daily or in two divided doses daily. Avoid administration late in the evening due to the risk of insomnia. (2.2)
Recommended starting dosage is 5 mg once or twice daily. (2.3)
Daily dosage may be increased in 5 mg increments at weekly intervals depending on clinical response. (2.3)
The recommended dosage range is 20 mg to 25 mg daily. (2.3)

2.1 Pretreatment Screening

Prior to treating patients with methamphetamine hydrochloride tablets, assess:

for the presence of cardiac disease (i.e., perform a careful history, family history of sudden death or ventricular arrhythmia, and physical examination) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].
the family history and clinically evaluate patients for motor or verbal tics or Tourette's syndrome before initiating methamphetamine hydrochloride tablets [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)].

2.2 Important Dosing Information

Administer methamphetamine hydrochloride tablets orally once daily or in two divided doses daily. Avoid taking methamphetamine hydrochloride tablets late in the evening due to the risk of insomnia.

2.3 Recommended Dosage

For pediatric patients 6 years of age and older, the recommended starting dosage is 5 mg methamphetamine hydrochloride tablets once or twice daily. The daily dosage may be increased in increments of 5 mg at weekly intervals based on clinical response of the patient. The recommended dosage range is 20 mg to 25 mg daily.

2.4 Dosage Modifications Due to Drug Interactions

Agents that alter urinary pH can impact excretion and alter blood levels of amphetamine. Acidifying agents (e.g., ascorbic acid) decrease blood levels, while alkalinizing agents (e.g., sodium bicarbonate) increase blood levels. Adjust methamphetamine hydrochloride tablets dosage based on clinical response [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

### A comparison of symptoms and drug use between patients with methamphetamine associated psychoses and patients diagnosed with schizophrenia in two acute psychiatric wards [^115ELTXg]. Psychiatry Research (2013). Low credibility.

Psychosis induced by the use of amphetamine or methamphetamine leads to dramatic symptoms and frequent readmissions and poses diagnostic challenges. Earlier studies have often relied on history taking and/or urine samples to reveal drug use. The aim of this study was to compare the psychotic symptoms of two groups: (1) acutely admitted patients who tested positive for methamphetamines and were diagnosed with drug-induced or methamphetamine-induced psychoses and (2) acutely admitted patients who tested negative for methamphetamines and were diagnosed with schizophrenia. Blood and urine samples were used. In addition, we investigated whether the severity of symptoms, in those who tested positive, was related to the blood concentration of methamphetamine. Of 285 patients who volunteered blood and/or urine samples within 48h of admission, 37 (13%) had recently taken methamphetamine. Positive psychotic symptoms between the two groups were compared by PANSS using the positive subscale. The results showed no differences in positive psychotic symptoms between the two groups. The severity of positive psychotic symptoms in patients with three different levels of urine/blood methamphetamine concentrations, were compared. We found no clinically or statistically significant relationship between blood methamphetamine levels and severity of psychotic symptoms.

Figure 1.
Monthly US Overdose Mortality and Urine Drug Test (UDT) Positivity Rates Stratified by Codetection of Synthetic Opioids

Mortality rates (with and without synthetic opioids) and UDT positivity rates (with and without synthetic opioids) were standardized (mean [SD], 0 [1]), and 6-month rolling mean is shown (dark lines; thinner lines repesent the actual monthly rates). Standardization was performed to place rates on a similar scale for visualization without distorting the association between detection and nondetection of synthetic opioids. Mortality data extend from 2013 to 2019, with UDT data including 2020.

National monthly UDT results for all 4 drug categories were consistent with these patterns. Overall, methamphetamine and synthetic opioids were highly correlated with overdose mortality rates (ρ = 0.96 for both), and all 4 drug categories were highly correlated with overdose mortality rates when synthetic opioids were coinvolved (Table 2). Spearman correlation coefficients in the presence of synthetic opioids over this period were 0.98 for methamphetamine, 0.94 for cocaine, 0.83 for other opioids, and 0.78 for heroin. In the absence of concurrent synthetic opioids, UDT correlations with overdose mortality rates persisted across all drug categories (ρ = 0.88 for methamphetamine, 0.81 for heroin, and 0.75 for other opioids) with the exception of cocaine (ρ = −0.37).

### Diagnostic accuracy for self-reported methamphetamine use versus oral fluid test as the reference standard in a methamphetamine-dependent intervention trial population [^113STHnf]. Addiction (2023). Medium credibility.

The fifth set of limitations concerns external validity. We used a population that volunteered and met specific criteria for an intervention trial. There are also particular circumstances relevant to a clinical trial that would not occur in regular clinical practice: the detailed collection of self‐report data using the daily TLFB method, double‐blinding of oral fluid assay results and shielding from negative consequences of use. Generalization of these results to other clinical populations — for example, those in stable treatment settings or people who use methamphetamine in the community — should be conducted with caution.

### Diagnostic accuracy for self-reported methamphetamine use versus oral fluid test as the reference standard in a methamphetamine-dependent intervention trial population [^111L5CtG]. Addiction (2023). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

Participant self‐report of no recent methamphetamine use in this RCT was accurate enough to be clinically useful, whether considering the variously calculated NPVs (prevalence‐dependent) or by considering the LR− values (independent of prevalence). This level of accuracy of self‐reported use may permit some cautious reduction in the frequency and cost of routine (i.e. weekly or each clinic visit) oral fluid (or other) assays in clinical settings routinely using these assays. Any resulting relative increase in the use of patient self‐report in place of biomarker testing in methamphetamine use disorder might reduce stigma and increase trust between providers and patients. However, the accuracy of self‐report may vary depending on context, and the current findings, which were based on a clinical trial setting, may not generalize to other clinical settings and are unlikely to generalize to settings where revealing illicit drug use may result in negative consequences (e.g. criminal justice settings). Where treatment units do not routinely use these assays, generalization of these results should be performed cautiously, and the diagnostic accuracy in other populations should be independently evaluated. Future research activities could also include a self‐report period for any methamphetamine use in the previous 48 hours to generate more exact estimates of diagnostic accuracy when compared with oral fluid samples analysed by the LC–MS/MS method.

### The cyclical and evolving nature of methamphetamine use: an evaluation of near real-time urine drug test results [^115kogiU]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective:

To determine methamphetamine positivity and copositivity with other drugs in urine drug test (UDT) results geographically through time.

Methods:

This cross-sectional study of UDT results from January 1, 2014, through December 31, 2019, included patient specimens submitted by health care professionals across the United States. The analysis used LC-MS/MS to detect cocaine, heroin, alcohol, marijuana and nonprescribed methamphetamine, fentanyl, methadone, buprenorphine, benzodiazepines, and other opioids. Logistic regression was used to evaluate association of demographic features and model yearly methamphetamine detection patterns across US census divisions. Odds ratios (OR) from logistic modeling were used to evaluate the impact of methamphetamine positivity on the spatio-temporal detection patterns of additional nonprescribed or illicit drugs.

Results:

The probability of being positive for methamphetamine increased nationally from 0.010 [0.010–0.011] in 2014 to 0.044 [0.042–0.046] in 2019, a 340% increase after correction for demographic covariates. The highest predicted positivity rate was in male patients, 25- to 34-years-old, from the West North Central division and from substance use disorder treatment centers. Nationally, copositivity ORs for fentanyl, heroin, and other opioids with methamphetamine were highest in 2019. Increases in ORs from 2014 through 2019 were statistically significant for heroin (P = 0.024) and fentanyl (P = 0.0085). Copositivity ORs for methamphetamine and other substances varied by census division.

Conclusions:

The probability of being positive for methamphetamine in UDT increased nationwide between 2014 and 2019. Not all census divisions are increasing at the same rate. Copositivity with additional substances is increasing in some census divisions, which further increases the risk of overdose and poor treatment outcomes.

### The cyclical and evolving nature of methamphetamine use: an evaluation of near real-time urine drug test results [^114PREZA]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Although methamphetamine use is increasing, the rate of those receiving treatment for methamphetamine use disorder has not changed significantly. Barriers to accessing treatment services may include availability, affordability, knowledge of how to seek treatment, lack of perceived need for treatment, and stigma associated with methamphetamine use. Psychosocial factors, including stigma, are some of the primary barriers to treatment of methamphetamine use disorder.

When methamphetamine is combined with other substances, additional challenges arise, including increased risk of overdose death, worse treatment engagement and outcomes, riskier health behaviors, and elevated psychological distress. Currently, clinical guidelines focus on solitary SUDs, which makes it more difficult to develop treatment strategies for those with multiple SUDs. This study demonstrated significant copositivity for several substances with the odds being highest for heroin, fentanyl, and other opioids in 2019. Adjusted OR for copositive drugs and drug classes vary considerably by geography, with those in the Pacific census division being at highest risk for copositive methamphetamine and heroin or other opioids in 2019. Methamphetamine combinations with opioids can be lethal, particularly when the user is opioid-naïve or unaware of the presence of other substances. While copositivity of fentanyl and methamphetamine seems to be declining in certain divisions, the increasing national OR and widespread availability of these substances necessitates caution and continued monitoring.

This study highlights the importance of carefully evaluating patients using methamphetamine for polysubstance use to tailor and adjust their treatment plan. The increasing combination of methamphetamine and opioids will require education and overdose prevention efforts that may not have previously reached the nonopioid user population or the HCPs who care for them. Examples include harm reduction strategies, warnings about the increased risk of overdose, and access to naloxone. Health care practitioners may need to prepare to treat more cases of mixed intoxication, withdrawal, and methamphetamine-induced psychosis. Lastly, there is a need to develop public health strategies to overcome barriers to accessing treatment for methamphetamine and polysubstance use that improve patient engagement and effectiveness of treatment outcomes.

Urine drug testing oversight — adolescents and young adults: Referencing AAP guidance that urine drug testing only be used in conjunction with a careful, confidential history and physical examination, the CGC recommended against home drug testing without the oversight of an appropriately trained clinician to interpret results, and clinicians should counsel parents/guardians to not conduct drug tests at home to assess stimulant use in adolescents and young adults without this oversight.

Urine drug testing — detection window and interpretation: In general, opioids, and most other substances of interest, are detectable in the urine for 1–3 days after use; a negative test does not rule out opioid use disorder or physical dependence, and urine, or other body fluid, testing is also helpful to identify use of other psychoactive substances.
