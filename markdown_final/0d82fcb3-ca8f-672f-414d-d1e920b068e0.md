## Question

What are first line options for hypertension in pregnancy

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about first-line antihypertensive options for hypertension in pregnancy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about distinguishing non-severe from severe hypertension because treatment thresholds and urgency differ. Then, I should verify which agents are consistently recommended as first-line across high-credibility guidelines. Next, I will examine comparative effectiveness and safety signals, including any nuances about beta-blockers and methyldopa. After that, I need to check dosing, formulation, and escalation strategies. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, prioritized list and confirm what to avoid in pregnancy, anchoring to contemporary guidelines and pivotal trials.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame: non-severe hypertension in pregnancy is typically defined as systolic blood pressure 140–159 mmHg or diastolic 90–109 mmHg, whereas severe hypertension is 160/110 mmHg or higher, which mandates urgent treatment to reduce maternal stroke risk. This distinction drives both the urgency and the route of therapy, so I need to keep it front and center as I reason through options and timing [^1148odRs] [^111V1JYb].

> Next, I should review which agents are universally endorsed as first-line for non-severe hypertension. Wait, let me verify the convergence across major societies: ESC 2024, ESH 2023, ISSHP 2022, and Hypertension Canada 2020 all list labetalol, extended-release nifedipine, and methyldopa as acceptable first-line oral agents, with WHO 2020 also including beta-blockers and alpha-agonists for non-severe disease, which aligns with this triad [^1123SXAV] [^111Xkjyp] [^114YDmXT] [^116uZg84] [^114ZdFeV].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about equivalence. I should double-check comparative effectiveness. A Cochrane review and subsequent analyses indicate that beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers are more effective than methyldopa at preventing severe hypertension, while not clearly differing in effects on preeclampsia, fetal death, small-for-gestational-age infants, or preterm birth. This supports prioritizing labetalol and nifedipine over methyldopa when feasible [^112pCAbj] [^112j87pt]. I should also note that a small RCT comparing labetalol and nifedipine showed similar mean blood pressure control, reinforcing that either is reasonable as first-line, though larger definitive trials are still needed [^114veR9B].

> I need to ensure I capture regional and guideline-specific nuances. ACOG 2019 emphasizes labetalol or nifedipine as preferred for chronic hypertension in pregnancy and de-emphasizes methyldopa due to perceived lower effectiveness and tolerability, whereas European guidelines still include methyldopa as an option. This difference is important for shared decision-making and local practice patterns [^117HWpg5] [^1123SXAV]. But wait, what if the patient is already on methyldopa and doing well? Continuation can still be reasonable if effective and tolerated, given the lack of clear superiority of one first-line agent over another in head-to-head outcomes [^112pCAbj].

> Let me consider formulation and pharmacokinetics because they affect both efficacy and adherence. Extended-release nifedipine is generally preferred over immediate-release for chronic control due to smoother blood pressure control and once-daily dosing, which may improve adherence, while immediate-release nifedipine remains useful for acute management when IV therapy is not immediately available. I should confirm that this aligns with guideline preferences, and yes, ESC and ESH endorse extended-release formulations for maintenance therapy [^1123SXAV] [^111CEya8]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought immediate-release nifedipine was contraindicated in pregnancy; that's not correct — it is acceptable for acute use, but extended-release is preferred for chronic therapy, so I should correct that assumption explicitly [^1123SXAV] [^1149pJm4].

> Next, I should review escalation strategy. I need to check whether guidelines advise up-titrating monotherapy before combining agents. ESH 2023 and ISSHP 2022 recommend maximizing the dose of a single agent before adding a second from a different class, which helps balance efficacy and safety and avoids unnecessary polypharmacy [^116eWGrm] [^113DyLwL]. If dual therapy is needed, combinations among labetalol, extended-release nifedipine, and methyldopa are reasonable, consistent with first-line classes [^111Aa2Eb].

> I will now examine severe hypertension management briefly to ensure continuity. For acute severe hypertension, IV labetalol, IV hydralazine, and oral immediate-release nifedipine are all acceptable first-line options, with treatment within 30–60 minutes to reduce stroke risk. Magnesium sulfate is indicated for preeclampsia with severe features for seizure prophylaxis, and this acute context complements, but does not replace, the chronic first-line choices I am outlining [^1149pJm4] [^112VyWVg] [^1119jY7b].

> But wait, what should I explicitly avoid in pregnancy? I should confirm contraindicated classes. ACE inhibitors, ARBs, direct renin inhibitors, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists should be avoided due to fetal toxicity, and atenolol should be avoided given associations with fetal growth restriction. Thiazide diuretics are generally not first-line in pregnancy due to theoretical volume effects, though they may be considered second-line in select cases if needed [^117HWpg5] [^117PMKXe] [^113pjtm2].

> Let me synthesize a practical hierarchy while acknowledging the evidence limits. For non-severe chronic or gestational hypertension, labetalol and extended-release nifedipine are the most consistently recommended and comparably effective first-line choices, with methyldopa as an alternative when the first two are unsuitable or unavailable. This ordering reflects better effectiveness at preventing severe hypertension versus methyldopa and favorable safety profiles in pregnancy [^1123SXAV] [^1161apTW] [^112pCAbj] [^112j87pt]. I should confirm dosing anchors: labetalol is commonly titrated up to 2400 mg/day in divided doses, extended-release nifedipine up to 120 mg/day, and methyldopa up to 3000 mg/day in divided doses, with individualized adjustments and monitoring for maternal and fetal effects [^111zqAu9].

> Finally, I need to ensure the treatment threshold is aligned with current guidance. Historically, therapy was initiated at 160/110 mmHg, but more recent data and ACOG guidance support initiating or intensifying therapy at 140/90 mmHg for chronic hypertension in pregnancy to reduce severe hypertension and adverse outcomes, which operationalizes the first-line agent selection I have outlined above [^116Mxi2X] [^116uYfWX].

First-line antihypertensive therapy in pregnancy is **labetalol, nifedipine, or methyldopa** [^1123SXAV] [^1161apTW] [^114YDmXT], with labetalol and nifedipine preferred for efficacy and tolerability [^117HWpg5] [^1114pHcc]. These agents are supported by major guidelines and have favorable safety profiles for maternal and fetal outcomes [^1123SXAV] [^1161apTW] [^114YDmXT]. Methyldopa is a reasonable alternative when first-line agents are contraindicated or not tolerated [^1161apTW]. ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and direct renin inhibitors are contraindicated in pregnancy [^117HWpg5] [^113EWkq3].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting first-line agents

- **Labetalol and nifedipine**: Both effectively reduce severe hypertension without increasing risks of fetal growth restriction, preterm birth, or neonatal complications [^116tMPqY] [^112pCAbj].
- **Methyldopa**: Although less effective than labetalol or nifedipine, it remains a safe alternative with no significant increase in adverse fetal outcomes [^1114pHcc] [^112pCAbj].

---

## Agents contraindicated or discouraged

- **ACE inhibitors and ARBs**: Contraindicated due to teratogenic effects, including fetal renal dysplasia and oligohydramnios [^117HWpg5] [^113EWkq3].
- **Direct renin inhibitors**: Contraindicated due to potential fetal harm [^117HWpg5] [^113EWkq3].
- **Thiazide diuretics**: Generally discouraged due to potential volume depletion and reduced placental perfusion, though they may be considered second-line in specific scenarios [^113pjtm2] [^116T597X].

---

## Clinical guidelines summary

| **Guideline** | **Recommended first-line agents** |
|-|-|
| ESC 2024 | - Labetalol <br/> - Nifedipine <br/> - Methyldopa [^1123SXAV] |
| ESH 2023 | - Labetalol <br/> - Methyldopa [^1161apTW] |
| ISSHP 2022 | - Methyldopa <br/> - Labetalol <br/> - Nifedipine [^114YDmXT] |
| ACOG 2019 | - Labetalol <br/> - Nifedipine (preferred) [^117HWpg5] |

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Labetalol, nifedipine, and methyldopa are the **first-line antihypertensive agents** for hypertension in pregnancy, with labetalol and nifedipine preferred for their efficacy and safety [^1123SXAV] [^1161apTW]. Methyldopa is a reasonable alternative when first-line agents are contraindicated or not tolerated [^1161apTW]. ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and direct renin inhibitors should be avoided due to fetal risks [^117HWpg5] [^113EWkq3].

Hypertensive disorders represent major causes of pregnancy-related maternal mortality worldwide. The current definition and treatment recommendations for elevated blood pressure (BP) during pregnancy in the United States have remained unchanged for many years, unlike the recommendations for hypertension treatment in the general population. Clinical studies have provided convincing evidence that women with hypertensive pregnancy disorders are at both immediate and long-term risk for cardiovascular complications; these findings suggest that consideration be given to lowering the presently recommended BP thresholds, both for the initiation of therapy and for therapeutic targets, and to simplifying the approach to the management of elevated BP in pregnancy. This review focuses on the current treatment strategies for hypertensive pregnancy disorders, new developments in the field of hypertension, in general, and in pregnant patients, in particular, and their potential impact on contemporary BP goals and the use of specific antihypertensive medications in pregnancy.

### Drug treatment of hypertension in pregnancy: a critical review of adult guideline recommendations [^116T597X]. Journal of Hypertension (2014). Low credibility.

This review evaluates the guideline recommendations for the management of hypertension in pregnancy as presented by 25 national/international guidelines developed for the management of arterial hypertension in adults. There is a general consensus that oral α-methyldopa and parenteral labetalol are the drugs of choice for nonsevere and severe hypertension in pregnancy, respectively. Long-acting nifedipine is recommended by various guidelines as an alternative for first-line and second-line therapy in nonsevere and severe hypertension. The safety of β-blockers, atenolol in particular, in early and late stages of pregnancy is unresolved; their use is contraindicated according to several guidelines. Diuretic-associated harmful effects on maternal and fetal outcomes are controversial: their use is discouraged in pregnancy. It is important to develop specific guidelines for treating hypertension in special groups such as adult females of childbearing age and sexually active female adolescents to minimize the risk of adverse effects of drugs on the fetus. In several guidelines, the antihypertensive classes, recommended drug(s), intended drug formulation, and route of administration are not explicit. These omissions should be addressed in future guideline revisions in order to enhance the guidelines' utility and credibility in clinical practice.

### Antihypertensive drug therapy for mild to moderate… [^1153LUWX]. AAFP (2019). Medium credibility.

Clinical Question Does treatment of mild to moderate hypertension in pregnancy with antihypertensive drugs improve pregnancy outcomes. Evidence-Based Answer Compared with placebo, antihypertensive drug therapy for mild to moderate hypertension caused by chronic hypertension, gestational hypertension, or preeclampsia during pregnancy does not affect any pregnancy outcomes. Practice Pointers In the United States, approximately 1% of pregnant women have chronic hypertension. Women with chronic hypertension in pregnancy have a higher risk of developing adverse obstetric outcomes, including gestational diabetes mellitus, postpartum hemorrhage, fetal growth restriction, preterm birth, and neonatal death, as well as a higher risk of preeclampsia. Preeclampsia occurs in 2% to 8% of all pregnancies worldwide.

This review included women with any form of hypertension in pregnancy with mild to moderate elevations in blood pressure. The primary outcomes examined in the analysis of antihypertensive therapy vs. placebo were development of severe hypertension in pregnancy, development of proteinuria/preeclampsia, miscarriage and fetal/neonatal death, preterm birth, and infants small for gestational age.

The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 2 Hypertension Canada/the Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada, 3 and the European Society of Cardiology/European Society of Hypertension 4 all recommend pharmacologic treatment of severe hypertension in pregnancy. Guidelines for the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension in pregnancy differ. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends that antihypertensive drug therapy be initiated only for systolic blood pressure of 160 mm Hg or greater or diastolic blood pressure of 110 mm Hg or greater, with a goal treatment range of 120 to 159/80 to 109 mm Hg.

Conclusions

Antihypertensive treatment reduces the risk of severe hypertension in pregnant women with chronic hypertension. A considerable paucity of data exists from randomized controlled trials to guide choice of antihypertensive agent for chronic hypertension in pregnancy. Adequately powered head‐to‐head randomized controlled trials of the commonly used antihypertensive agents are required to inform prescribing.

### ACOG practice bulletin no. 203: chronic hypertension in pregnancy [^117HWpg5]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). High credibility.

Chronic hypertension in pregnancy — pharmacologic management — emphasizes agent selection and treatment context. When antihypertensive therapy is used during pregnancy, the context is either chronic treatment to lower blood pressure to maintenance levels, sometimes slowly during 24–48 hours often in the outpatient setting, or acute lowering of critical hypertension in the hospital setting. For the long-term treatment of pregnant women who require pharmacologic therapy, labetalol or nifedipine are reasonable options and are recommended above all other antihypertensive drugs. The use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, renin inhibitors, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists is generally not recommended. Methyldopa is generally less favored because it appears to be less effective compared with other agents and because of adverse effects. Diuretics, like hydrochlorothiazide, generally are considered second-line agents for the treatment of hypertension in pregnancy, and theoretical concern for intravascular volume depletion with fetal effects is not supported by data from a meta-analysis of nine randomized trials as well as a systematic review.

### Comparative effectiveness and safety of labetalol versus nifedipine for treatment of chronic hypertension during pregnancy [^1165JhBH]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Chronic hypertension affects a growing proportion of pregnancies and has been implicated in the increases in pregnancy-related morbidity and mortality in the United States. Current clinical guidelines in the United States and Europe recommend medication treatment of chronic hypertension during pregnancy to a target blood pressure of < 140/90 mm Hg. The primary goal of treatment is prevention of severe hypertension and preeclampsia, which lead to complications in both the pregnant individual and fetus. The primary concern about medication treatment, however, is the possibility of adverse effects upon the fetus, particularly fetal growth restriction because of impaired placental blood flow. Clinical guidelines recommend either labetalol or nifedipine as first-line therapy for chronic hypertension during pregnancy. The American College of Cardiology, the American Heart Association, and the European Society of Cardiology also include methyldopa as a first-line therapy option, although the European guidelines note concerns about the effectiveness and side effects of methyldopa. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, however, in 2019 removed methyldopa as a recommended treatment option. Nationwide claims data indicate that labetalol and nifedipine are now the predominant medications used in the United States to treat hypertension during pregnancy, with methyldopa rarely used.

Although labetalol and nifedipine are both first-line therapies for hypertension during pregnancy, it is unclear whether they differ in effectiveness and safety. Both medications are vasodilators via different mechanisms of action that can be used for both chronic and acute blood pressure control. As a combined alpha- and beta-blocker, labetalol additionally reduces cardiac output and renin release. In nonpregnant populations, data on long-term effectiveness and safety are more robust for nifedipine than for labetalol, but labetalol has a much longer history of use during pregnancy, with more data on its effectiveness and safety than nifedipine.

No large randomized controlled trials have compared the effectiveness and safety of labetalol and nifedipine for chronic hypertension treatment during pregnancy. The low prevalence of chronic hypertension during pregnancy (approximately 2% to 3%) and the low incidence of the important clinical outcomes make comparative trials difficult to perform. We therefore sought to generate real-world evidence from nationwide observational data by applying a target trial emulation approach to evaluate whether labetalol and nifedipine differ in effectiveness and safety in the treatment of chronic hypertension during pregnancy.

### ACOG practice bulletin. chronic hypertension in pregnancy. ACOG committee on practice bulletins [^111JGZUb]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2001). Low credibility.

Chronic hypertension occurs in up to 5% of pregnant women; rates vary according to the population studied and the criteria used for confirming the diagnosis (1,2). This complication may result in significant maternal, fetal and neonatal morbidity and mortality. There has been confusion over the terminology and criteria used to diagnose this complication, as well as the benefit and potential harm of treatment during pregnancy. The purpose of this document is to review the effects of chronic hypertension on pregnancy, to clarify the terminology and criteria used to define and diagnose it during pregnancy, and to review the available evidence for treatment options.

### Prescribing for pregnancy: chronic hypertension [^114bZ3C6]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2022). Medium credibility.

An increasing number of women who become pregnant have pre-existing hypertension. For this group of women, a proportion will develop pre-eclampsia or severe hypertension which can impact on maternal and fetal well-being. Women with raised blood pressure should be offered reliable contraception when they do not wish to conceive and pre-conception counselling to address pregnancy-related concerns and advice on preparation for pregnancy and the use of medicines. For women with a history of hypertension, the smallest number of safe medicines at the lowest effective doses should be used while preparing for and during pregnancy. This article forms part of the series of prescribing for pregnancy and discusses the impact of hypertension on pregnancy, the impact of pregnancy on hypertension and options for treatment.

### Hypertensive crisis in pregnancy [^115RLzW1]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Severe hypertension in pregnancy is a medical emergency, defined as systolic blood pressure (BP) ≥ 160 mm Hg and/or diastolic BP ≥ 110 mm Hg taken 15 minutes to 4 or more hours apart. Outside pregnancy, acute severe hypertension (HTN) is defined as a BP greater than 180/110 to 120 reproducible on 2 occasions. The lower threshold for severe HTN in pregnancy reflects the increased risk for adverse outcomes, particularly maternal stroke and death, and may be a source of under-recognition and treatment delay, particularly in nonobstetrical health care settings. Once a severe hypertension episode is recognized, antihypertensive therapy should be initiated as soon as feasibly possible, at least within 30 to 60 minutes. Intravenous (IV) labetalol, hydralazine, and oral immediate-release nifedipine are all recommended first-line agents and should be administered according to available institutional protocols and based on provider knowledge and familiarity.

### Labetalol versus nifedipine as antihypertensive treatment for chronic hypertension in pregnancy: a randomized controlled trial [^114veR9B]. Hypertension (2017). Low credibility.

Data from randomized controlled trials to guide antihypertensive agent choice for chronic hypertension in pregnancy are limited; this study aimed to compare labetalol and nifedipine, additionally assessing the impact of ethnicity on treatment efficacy. Pregnant women with chronic hypertension (12 +0 +6 weeks' gestation) were enrolled at 4 UK centers (August 2014 to October 2015). Open-label first-line antihypertensive treatment was randomly assigned: labetalol- (200–1800 mg/d) or nifedipine-modified release (20–80 mg/d). Analysis included 112 women (98%) who completed the study (labetalol n = 55, nifedipine n = 57). Maximum blood pressure after randomization was 161/101 mm Hg with labetalol versus 163/105 mm Hg with nifedipine (mean difference systolic: 1.2 mm Hg [-4.9 to 7.2 mm Hg], diastolic: 3.3 mm Hg [-0.6 to 7.3 mm Hg]). Mean blood pressure was 134/84 mm Hg with labetalol and 134/85 mm Hg with nifedipine (mean difference systolic: 0.3 mm Hg [-2.8 to 3.4 mm Hg], and diastolic: -1.9 mm Hg [-4.1 to 0.3 mm Hg]). Nifedipine use was associated with a 7.4-mm Hg reduction (-14.4 to -0.4 mm Hg) in central aortic pressure, measured by pulse wave analysis. No difference in treatment effect was observed in black women (n = 63), but a mean 4 mm Hg reduction (-6.6 to -0.8 mm Hg; P = 0.015) in brachial diastolic blood pressure was observed with labetalol compared with nifedipine in non-black women (n = 49). Labetalol and nifedipine control mean blood pressure to target in pregnant women with chronic hypertension. This study provides support for a larger definitive trial scrutinizing the benefits and side effects of first-line antihypertensive treatment.

Antihypertensive selection in pregnancy — first-line therapy and safety — notes that when therapy is indicated in individuals planning pregnancy or who become pregnant, labetalol and extended-release nifedipine are the preferred first-line agents; among them, no specific agent is preferred due to lack of comparative data. BB and CCB appear more effective than methyldopa for prevention of severe hypertension. Available data indicate amlodipine does not appear to be associated with a heightened risk of major congenital malformations, whereas atenolol has been associated with growth restriction and lower fetal weight and should be avoided in pregnancy.

### ACOG practice bulletin no. 203 summary: chronic hypertension in pregnancy [^112gkfqE]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). Medium credibility.

Chronic hypertension is present in 0.9–1.5% of pregnant women (1) and may result in significant maternal, fetal, and neonatal morbidity and mortality. The rate of maternal chronic hypertension increased by 67% from 2000 to 2009, with the largest increase (87%) among African American women. This increase is largely secondary to the obesity epidemic and increasing maternal age (1, 2). The trend is expected to continue. The purpose of this document is to clarify the criteria used to define and diagnose chronic hypertension before or during pregnancy, to review the effects of chronic hypertension on pregnancy and vice versa, and to appraise the available evidence for management options. The purpose of these revised best practice recommendations is to provide a rational approach to chronic hypertension in pregnancy based on new research data and relevant pathophysiologic and pharmacologic considerations.

### Oral antihypertensives for nonsevere pregnancy hypertension: systematic review, network meta-and trial sequential analyses [^116tMPqY]. Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy are a leading cause of maternal, fetal, and newborn mortality and morbidity, worldwide. As such, a large proportion of antenatal care is devoted to their detection.

It is established that antihypertensive therapy is better than placebo or no antihypertensive therapy (placebo/no therapy) at decreasing the risk of severe maternal hypertension. A strategy of blood pressure (BP) control in pregnancy with antihypertensive therapy reduces severe hypertension without adversely affecting fetal/newborn death or illness, fetal growth restriction, or preterm birth. Importantly, severe hypertension is associated with heightened maternal and fetal/newborn risk, similar to (and independent of) preeclampsia, making severe hypertension an outcome worthy of avoidance, and not just one worthy of detection and treatment. Many national and international clinical practice guidelines now advocate BP control in pregnancy,

The choice of antihypertensive therapy in pregnancy remains controversial. In previous direct comparisons, no antihypertensive has been shown to be superior to others, even among the most commonly recommended: labetalol, other β-blockers, nifedipine, and methyldopa. However, there is substantial uncertainty around point estimates of effect, due (at least in part) to the limited number of high-quality randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing drugs directly. However, recent advances in meta-analytical methods now enable use of indirect evidence, through network meta-analysis (NMA), an approach that pools data from multiple different treatments and their comparisons, and not just from pairs of treatment versus control options, thereby allowing one to compare the relative effectiveness of several treatments.

Using a Bayesian NMA framework, we sought to address which antihypertensive agent(s) is(are) superior to placebo/no therapy or other antihypertensives for lowering BP in nonsevere hypertension in pregnancy, without increasing fetal/newborn complications; and where no firm conclusions for the main outcomes could be drawn, estimate the additional number of trial participants required to draw clinically relevant conclusions and guide clinical practice.

### Impact of antihypertensive treatment on maternal and perinatal outcomes in pregnancy complicated by chronic hypertension: a Systematic review and meta-analysis [^111mLijr]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

There is emerging evidence that tighter control of hypertension outside pregnancy reduces risks of long‐term cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. 77 In light of the Control of Hypertension In Pregnancy Study data suggesting fetal safety with tighter control of hypertension, future research should focus on head‐to‐head randomized controlled trials of the most commonly used antihypertensive agents in current practice; this should include smaller trials to evaluate efficacy and larger trials to assess effectiveness of agent(s) for control of chronic hypertension in pregnancy. In addition, further consideration of the impact of maternal demographic factors should be considered such as body mass index and ethnicity. Outside pregnancy, calcium‐channel blockers are recommended as first‐line antihypertensive therapy for those of African or Caribbean family origin 73; this is due to differing pathophysiological pathways causing hypertension that vary with ethnic origin. 80 It is possible that the efficacy of antihypertensive treatment is similarly affected by maternal ethnic background. This systematic review provides evidence to recommend that women with chronic hypertension in pregnancy should receive antihypertensive treatment to reduce the incidence of severe hypertension and its associated maternal morbidity without adversely affecting perinatal outcome.

### Oral antihypertensives for nonsevere pregnancy hypertension: systematic review, network meta-and trial sequential analyses [^112j87pt]. Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

Interpretation

It is unsurprising that antihypertensive therapy outperforms, by a large margin, placebo/no therapy in lowering BP. Many national and international guidelines now recommend that practitioners offer antihypertensive therapy to women to normalize BP in pregnancy. Notwithstanding neonatal concerns, it may be reasonable to recommend first-line therapy with labetalol, given the additional potential benefits of reduced proteinuria/preeclampsia and perinatal death. Other reasonable antihypertensive choices include β-blockers, calcium channel blockers, labetalol, methyldopa, or multi-drug therapy, choices that make more likely that a hypertensive pregnant woman, regardless of the care setting, would have access to an antihypertensive drug.

Our findings are consistent with traditional meta-analysis that has refuted an association between β-blockers and fetal growth restriction. Notwithstanding, concerns about atenolol remain; this drug was not analyzed separately from β-blockers in this NMA, but was in another that examined antihypertensives for treatment of chronic hypertension in pregnancy, showing an association with SGA. There are many other beta-blockers available for use worldwide. Importantly, the pattern of contrary effects of antihypertensives on SGA and preterm birth, with no overall effect on neonatal morbidity (as measured by neonatal care unit admission), mirrors findings from the Control of Hypertension in Pregnancy Study trial.

### Continuous positive airway pressure treatment and hypertensive adverse outcomes in pregnancy: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116JpUzG]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

For OSA treatment, the main options include lifestyle modification, exercise, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), mandibular advancement devices, and surgery. Among these treatment options, CPAP is considered the first-line and criterion standard therapy and regarded as the most feasible choice before, during, and after pregnancy due to the characteristic of noninvasiveness.

Studies have shown a substantial reduction in the incidence of hypertensive syndromes in pregnant women with OSA after using CPAP during pregnancy. However, some recent randomized clinical trials (RCTs) did not demonstrate a positive effect of CPAP treatment. Currently, there is still no consensus guideline on the management of OSA during pregnancy due to underestimated consequences and vulnerability of the population. As a result, the effectiveness of CPAP treatment in pregnant women with OSA remains inconclusive. Our study aimed to review all available RCTs and observational studies (non-RCTs) with data to provide an updated meta-analysis on the association between CPAP treatment and reduction of adverse maternal outcomes in pregnant women with OSA. Additionally, we discuss the indication for implementing CPAP treatment in pregnant women with OSA and the optimal timing for initiating CPAP treatment during pregnancy.

### Study protocol for the randomized controlled EVA (early vascular adjustments) trial: tailored treatment of mild hypertension in pregnancy to prevent severe hypertension and preeclampsia [^112kWMT4]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

In contrast to severe gestational hypertension, it is questioned whether antihypertensive medication for mild to moderate gestational hypertension prevents adverse maternal and offspring outcomes. Hypertensive drugs halve the risk of severe hypertension, but do not seem to prevent progression to preeclampsia or reduce the risk of complications in offspring. In fact, beta-blockers, a first line therapy option, are suspected to impair foetal growth. Disappointing effects of antihypertensive medication can be anticipated when the pharmacological mode of action does not match the underlying haemodynamic imbalance. Hypertension may result from 1) high cardiac output, low vascular resistance state, in which beta blockade is expected to be most effective, or 2) low cardiac output, high vascular resistance state where dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers or central-acting alpha agonists might be the best corrective medication. In the latter, beta-blockade might be maternally ineffective and even contribute to impaired foetal growth by keeping cardiac output low. We propose a randomized controlled trial to determine whether correcting the haemodynamic imbalance in women with mild to moderate hypertension reduces the development of severe hypertension and/or preeclampsia more than non-pharmacological treatment does, without alleged negative effects on foetal growth.

Methods

Women diagnosed with mild to moderate hypertension without proteinuria or signs of other organ damage before 37weeks of pregnancy are invited to participate in this randomized controlled trial. Women randomized to the intervention group will be prescribed tailored antihypertensive medication, using a simple diagnostic and treatment algorithm based on the mean arterial pressure/heart rate ratio, which serves as an easy-to-determine proxy for maternal circulatory state. Women randomized to the control group will receive non-pharmacological standard care according to national and international guidelines. In total, 208 women will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio. The primary outcome is progression to severe hypertension and preeclampsia and the secondary outcomes are adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes.

Discussion

This trial will provide evidence of whether tailoring treatment of mild to moderate gestational hypertension to the individual haemodynamic profile prevents maternal disease progression.

### ACOG committee opinion no. 767: emergent therapy for acute-onset, severe hypertension during pregnancy and the postpartum period [^1149pJm4]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). Medium credibility.

Acute-onset, severe systolic hypertension; severe diastolic hypertension; or both can occur during the prenatal, intrapartum, or postpartum periods. Pregnant women or women in the postpartum period with acute-onset, severe systolic hypertension; severe diastolic hypertension; or both require urgent antihypertensive therapy. Introducing standardized, evidence-based clinical guidelines for the management of patients with preeclampsia and eclampsia has been demonstrated to reduce the incidence of adverse maternal outcomes. Individuals and institutions should have mechanisms in place to initiate the prompt administration of medication when a patient presents with a hypertensive emergency. Treatment with first-line agents should be expeditious and occur as soon as possible within 30–60 minutes of confirmed severe hypertension to reduce the risk of maternal stroke. Intravenous labetalol and hydralazine have long been considered first-line medications for the management of acute-onset, severe hypertension in pregnant women and women in the postpartum period. Although relatively less information currently exists for the use of calcium channel blockers for this clinical indication, the available evidence suggests that immediate release oral nifedipine also may be considered as a first-line therapy, particularly when intravenous access is not available. In the rare circumstance that intravenous bolus labetalol, hydralazine, or immediate release oral nifedipine fails to relieve acute-onset, severe hypertension and is given in successive appropriate doses, emergent consultation with an anesthesiologist, maternal-fetal medicine subspecialist, or critical care subspecialist to discuss second-line intervention is recommended.

### ACOG practice bulletin no. 203: chronic hypertension in pregnancy [^1148odRs]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). High credibility.

Chronic hypertension in pregnancy — blood pressure thresholds and targets — uses severe-range criteria and individualized goals. Recommendations for treating women with chronic hypertension in the severe range (ie, systolic blood pressure of 160 mm Hg or more or diastolic blood pressure of 110 mm Hg or more) are based on indirect evidence, and in women with evidence of end-organ damage or severe thrombocytopenia, antihypertensive treatment is recommended at even lower thresholds (eg, systolic blood pressure of 150 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure of 100 mm Hg). It is recommended to maintain blood pressure levels for pregnant women with chronic hypertension treated with antihypertensive medications at or above 120 mm Hg but below 160 mm Hg systolic and at or above 80 mm Hg but below 110 mm Hg diastolic, and overly aggressive blood pressure lowering is discouraged because of concerns that uteroplacental blood flow may be compromised; for women with comorbid conditions, such as diabetes or renal disease, blood pressure goals should be lower. Evidence for severe-range treatment in chronic hypertension is limited, as a Cochrane review included 35 trials (3,573 women) and women with chronic hypertension were generally excluded or lacked subgroup analyses.

Systematic reviews with meta-analysis represent the highest level of evidence used to guide clinical practice. The defining criteria used to diagnose preeclampsia have evolved, and will likely continue to evolve. Proteinuria is sufficient but not necessary when defining preeclampsia. Hypertension without proteinuria but with severe features is diagnostic. The methods used to measure urinary protein have changed. The gold standard remains the 24-hour urine test. The efficacy of low-dose aspirin in preventing preeclampsia is a function of baseline risk. Data suggest that treating mild to moderate blood pressure has clear maternal benefits with little fetal or neonatal risk.

### Hypertension in pregnancy: diagnosis, blood pressure goals, and pharmacotherapy: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^115R5oq6]. Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) remain one of the major causes of pregnancy-related maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality worldwide. Affected women are also at increased risk for cardiovascular disease later in life, independently of traditional cardiovascular disease risks. Despite the immediate and long-term cardiovascular disease risks, recommendations for diagnosis and treatment of HDP in the United States have changed little, if at all, over past decades, unlike hypertension guidelines for the general population. The reasons for this approach include the question of benefit from normalization of blood pressure treatment for pregnant women, coupled with theoretical concerns for fetal well-being from a reduction in utero-placental perfusion and in utero exposure to antihypertensive medication. This report is based on a review of current literature and includes normal physiological changes in pregnancy that may affect clinical presentation of HDP; HDP epidemiology and the immediate and long-term sequelae of HDP; the pathophysiology of preeclampsia, an HDP commonly associated with proteinuria and increasingly recognized as a heterogeneous disease with different clinical phenotypes and likely distinct pathological mechanisms; a critical overview of current national and international HDP guidelines; emerging evidence that reducing blood pressure treatment goals in pregnancy may reduce maternal severe hypertension without increasing the risk of pregnancy loss, high-level neonatal care, or overall maternal complications; and the increasingly recognized morbidity associated with postpartum hypertension/preeclampsia. Finally, we discuss the future of research in the field and the pressing need to study socioeconomic and biological factors that may contribute to racial and ethnic maternal health care disparities.

### Antihypertensive drug therapy for mild to moderate hypertension during pregnancy [^112pCAbj]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Antihypertensive drugs are often used in the belief that lowering blood pressure will prevent progression to more severe disease, and thereby improve pregnancy outcome. This Cochrane Review is an updated review, first published in 2001 and subsequently updated in 2007 and 2014.

Objectives

To assess the effects of antihypertensive drug treatments for women with mild to moderate hypertension during pregnancy.

Search Methods

We searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth's Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (13 September 2017), and reference lists of retrieved studies.

Selection Criteria

All randomised trials evaluating any antihypertensive drug treatment for mild to moderate hypertension during pregnancy, defined as systolic blood pressure 140 to 169 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure 90 to 109 mmHg. Comparisons were of one or more antihypertensive drug(s) with placebo, with no antihypertensive drug, or with another antihypertensive drug, and where treatment was planned to continue for at least seven days.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data and checked them for accuracy.

Main Results

For this update, we included 63 trials (data from 58 trials, 5909 women), with moderate to high risk of bias overall. We carried out GRADE assessments for the main 'antihypertensive drug versus placebo/no antihypertensive drug' comparison only. Evidence was graded from very low to moderate certainty, with downgrading mainly due to design limitations and imprecision. For many outcomes, trials contributing data evaluated different hypertensive drugs; while we did not downgrade for this indirectness, results should be interpreted with caution. Antihypertensive drug versus placebo/no antihypertensive drug (31 trials, 3485 women)Primary outcomes: moderate-certainty evidence suggests that use of antihypertensive drug(s) probably halves the risk of developing severe hypertension (risk ratio (RR) 0.49; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.40 to 0.60; 20 trials, 2558 women), but may have little or no effect on the risk of proteinuria/pre-eclampsia (average risk ratio (aRR) 0.92; 95% CI 0.75 to 1.14; 23 trials, 2851 women; low-certainty evidence). Moderate-certainty evidence also shows that antihypertensive drug(s) probably have little or no effect in the risk of total reported fetal or neonatal death (including miscarriage) (aRR 0.72; 95% CI 0.50 to 1.04; 29 trials, 3365 women), small-for-gestational-age babies (aRR 0.96; 95% CI 0.78 to 1.18; 21 trials, 2686 babies) or preterm birth less than 37 weeks (aRR 0.96; 95% CI 0.83 to 1.12; 15 trials, 2141 women).

Secondary Outcomes

we are uncertain of the effect of antihypertensive drug(s) on the risk of maternal death, severe pre-eclampsia, or eclampsia, orimpaired long-term growth and development of the baby in infancy and childhood, because the certainty of this evidence is very low. There may be little or no effect on the risk of changed/stopped drugs due to maternal side-effects, or admission to neonatal or intensive care nursery (low-certainty evidence). There is probably little or no difference in the risk of elective delivery (moderate-certainty evidence). Antihypertensive drug versus another antihypertensive drug (29 trials, 2774 women)Primary outcomes: beta blockers and calcium channel blockers together in the meta-analysis appear to be more effective than methyldopa in avoiding an episode of severe hypertension (RR 0.70; 95% CI 0.56 to 0.88; 11 trials, 638 women). There was also an increase in this risk when other antihypertensive drugs were compared with calcium channel blockers (RR 1.86; 95% CI 1.09 to 3.15; 5 trials, 223 women), but no evidence of a difference when methyldopa and calcium channel blockers together were compared with beta blockers (RR1.18, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.48; 10 trials, 692 women). No evidence of a difference in the risk of proteinuria/pre-eclampsia was found when alternative drugs were compared with methyldopa (aRR 0.78; 95% CI 0.58 to 1.06; 11 trials, 997 women), with calcium channel blockers (aRR: 1.24, 95% CI 0.70 to 2.19; 5 trials, 375 women), or with beta blockers (aRR 1.21, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.67; 12 trials, 1107 women). For the babies, we found no evidence of a difference in the risk oftotal reported fetal or neonatal death (including miscarriage) when comparing other antihypertensive drugs with methyldopa (aRR 0.77, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.14; 22 trials, 1791 babies), with calcium channel blockers (aRR 0.90, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.57; nine trials, 700 babies), or with beta blockers (aRR: 1.23, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.88; 19 trials, 1652 babies); nor in the risk for small-for-gestational age in the comparison with methyldopa (aRR 0.79, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.20; seven trials, 597 babies), with calcium channel blockers (aRR 1.05, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.73; four trials, 200 babies), or with beta blockers (average RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.60; 7 trials, 680 babies). No evidence of an overall difference among groups in the risk of preterm birth (less than 37 weeks) was found in the comparison with methyldopa (aRR: 0.91; 95% CI 0.68 to 1.22; 11 trials, 835 women), with calcium channel blockers (aRR 0.85, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.23; six trials, 330 women), or with beta blockers (aRR 1.22, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.66; 9 trials, 806 women).

Secondary Outcomes

There were no cases of maternal death andeclampsia. There is no evidence of a difference in the risk of severe pre-eclampsia, changed/stopped drug due to maternal side-effects, elective delivery, admission to neonatal or intensive care nursery when other antihypertensive drugs are compared with methyldopa, calcium channel blockers or beta blockers. Impaired long-term growth and development in infancy and childhood was not reported for these comparisons.

Authors' Conclusions

Antihypertensive drug therapy for mild to moderate hypertension during pregnancy reduces the risk of severe hypertension. The effect on other clinically important outcomes remains unclear. If antihypertensive drugs are used, beta blockers and calcium channel blockers appear to be more effective than the alternatives for preventing severe hypertension. High-quality large sample-sized randomised controlled trials are required in order to provide reliable estimates of the benefits and adverse effects of antihypertensive treatment for mild to moderate hypertension for both mother and baby, as well as costs to the health services, women and their families.

### Clinical guidance for the integration of the findings of the chronic hypertension and pregnancy (CHAP) study [^116Mxi2X]. ACOG (2022). High credibility.

Chronic hypertension in pregnancy — ACOG treatment threshold and medication management recommends utilizing 140/90 as the threshold for initiation or titration of medical therapy for chronic hypertension in pregnancy, rather than the previously recommended threshold of 160/110. Using a treatment threshold of 140/90 for pregnant people with chronic hypertension provides improved outcomes compared to initiating treatments only for blood pressures at or above 160/105. For patients already on blood pressure medications at the start of pregnancy, in the absence of mitigating factors or side effects, they can be maintained on their medications rather than discontinuing them and waiting to initiate treatment for blood pressures in the severe range. The CHAP study did not establish a goal blood pressure, but rather used a threshold for treatment of 140/90.

A randomized trial comparing IV hydralazine to oral nifedipine showed equivalence of the two agents in the time to achieve blood pressure targets. No specific recommendations are available regarding the choice of antihypertensive agent based on the suspected hypertension mechanism (eg, superimposed preeclampsia or worsening chronic hypertension).

Antihypertensive management

a When/where?

In LMICs there is consensus on immediate hospital treatment of severe arterial hypertension (systolic blood pressure (SBP) > 160 and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) > 110). In Indonesia, consider antihypertensive medication for outpatient treatment if blood pressure consistently exceeds 140/90 mmHg.

b First-line treatment

In severe hypertension, there is a consensus that LMICs support immediate stabilization with recommended agents, including intravenous hydralazine, labetalol, and oral nifedipine, particularly in scenarios where venous access poses a challenge. An analysis of 91 EMLs from 144 LMICs (Cross-sectional study) revealed a wide range of antihypertensive therapies, whose selection factors include physician familiarity, availability, adverse effects, and teratogenic potential. In general terms (Prospective study), during the antepartum period, nifedipine and Alpha-methyldopa are often chosen to maintain arterial pressure; transitioning to amlodipine or an ACE inhibitor is recommended in the postpartum period.

South African guidelines (Qualitative narrative review, Feasibility study and Cross-sectional study) recommend using 10 mg of rapid-acting oral nifedipine or intravenous labetalol, followed by a maintenance regimen of 1 g of oral alpha-methyldopa. Nitroglycerin is preferred for hypertension complicated by pulmonary edema. The recommended treatment for mild preeclampsia involves the administration of alpha-methyldopa at a dosage of 500 mg three times a day. In Latin America and the Philippines (Cross-sectional study and Feasibility study), administering bolus doses of oral hydralazine, labetalol, or nifedipine is the primary therapeutic approach.

In the Philippines (Qualitative Narrative review), intravenous nicardipine is additionally recommended as a first-line management option. In women presenting with well-controlled non-severe hypertension or chronic hypertension, these guidelines suggest antihypertensive use to maintain BP within specified ranges (SBP 130–155 mmHg and DBP 80–105 mmHg), with methyldopa, calcium antagonists, or beta-blockers. In Nigeria (Feasibility study), community health workers often use amiloride, hydrochlorothiazide, or nifedipine as preliminary interventions before referring patients to health centers for complete treatment. Methyldopa and hydralazine are frequently adopted by nurses and physicians. In Pakistan (Mixed method study), these teams also use methyldopa (250 mg) before referral.

### Chronic hypertension in pregnancy [^115QFfcs]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Medium credibility.

Chronic hypertension and associated cardiovascular disease are among the leading causes of maternal and perinatal morbidity and death in the United States. Chronic hypertension in pregnancy is associated with a host of adverse outcomes that include preeclampsia, cesarean delivery, cerebrovascular accidents, fetal growth restriction, preterm birth, and maternal and perinatal death. There are several key issues related to the diagnosis and management of chronic hypertension in pregnancy where data are limited and further research is needed. These challenges and recent guidelines for the management of chronic hypertension are reviewed. Well-timed pregnancies are of utmost importance to reduce the risks of chronic hypertension; long-acting reversible contraceptive options are preferred. Research to determine optimal blood pressure thresholds for diagnosis and treatment to optimize short- and long-term maternal and perinatal outcomes should be prioritized along with interventions to reduce extant racial and ethnic disparities.

### Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy: innovative management strategies [^115JrfNH]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Given that preeclampsia can develop de novo after delivery, women in the postpartum period should be given discharge instructions that include information about the signs and symptoms of preeclampsia as well as the importance of presenting for medical evaluation in the event that they occur. As delineated by the ACOG guidelines, treatment with first-line agents in patients with acute severe hypertension, identified as systolic BP ≥ 160 mm Hg or diastolic BP ≥ 110 mm Hg, should be initiated within 30 to 60 minutes to reduce risk of maternal stroke. First-line agents for treatment in both pregnancy and postpartum include IV labetalol and hydralazine, or more recently, the use of oral nifedipine if IV access is not established. BP targets in cases of severe hypertension should not aim for normalization of BP but rather target a range of 140 to 150/90 to 100 mm Hg. In severe cases, such as when medication fails to reduce BP to the target range, consultation with anesthesiologist, maternal fetal medicine subspecialist, or critical care subspecialist is recommended.

ACOG and the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommend achieving a BP of 140/90 mm Hg in the immediate postpartum period. However, there are no standardized management guidelines for specific antihypertensive agents or parameters for medication uptitration in the postpartum period. Thus, physician preference and experience, as well as safety of medical therapy during breastfeeding often affect the approach.

Discussion

This is the largest systematic review of the evidence from randomized controlled trials to guide antihypertensive treatment specifically for chronic hypertension in pregnancy. Other systematic reviews have pooled results for chronic and gestational hypertension, but given the different etiology and duration of treatment, there are concerns with this approach. The reduction in the incidence of severe hypertension in pregnant women with chronic hypertension with the use of antihypertensive treatment is clinically important given the short‐ and long‐term associated maternal morbidity and mortality. 8, 9, 10, 19, 20, 21 It is not possible at this time to recommend one agent over another for optimal blood pressure control, as there have only been 3 head‐to‐head randomized controlled trials enrolling 101 women that have examined this outcome. 32, 33, 45 No overall reduction in the risk of pre‐eclampsia was seen with the use of antihypertensive treatment.

The paucity of data to guide selection of antihypertensive treatment for chronic hypertension in pregnancy is also highlighted. Only 15 randomized controlled trials totaling 1166 pregnancies meeting study eligibility criteria were identified, and many of these were too small to address whether antihypertensive treatments reduce the risk of superimposed pre‐eclampsia or influence other measures of perinatal morbidity. The only study published in the last 18 years by Vigil and colleagues compared 3 active treatment arms and antihypertensive treatments not recommended by most international guidelines as first‐line agents (amlodipine, furosemide, and aspirin). 65 It could not be included in the meta‐analysis given this design. This compares with many more trials and participants outside pregnancy; a recent systematic review of antihypertensive treatment (excluding pregnant participants) for the prevention of cardiovascular disease identified 123 randomized controlled trials including 613 815 participants. 69 Of the 15 studies reported here, only 10 focused on chronic hypertension in pregnancy, and the other 5 enrolled a mixed population of chronic and gestational hypertension, from which data for the participants with chronic hypertension were extracted. Given the changes in management of hypertension both inside and outside pregnancy and that all of these trials were published between 1976 and 1998, optimal antihypertensive therapy for treating chronic hypertension in pregnancy warrants further investigation through large randomized controlled trials.

Box 5 — sample order set for severe intrapartum or postpartum hypertension initial first-line management with hydralazine — specifies immediate actions, dosing, and monitoring based on blood pressure (BP) thresholds. Notify physician if systolic BP is 160 mm Hg or more or if diastolic BP is 110 mm Hg or more and institute fetal surveillance if undelivered and fetus is viable. If severe BP elevations persist for 15 minutes or more, administer hydralazine (5 mg or 10 mg intravenous (IV) for more than 2 minutes) and repeat BP measurement in 20 minutes; if either BP threshold is still exceeded, administer hydralazine (10 mg IV for more than 2 minutes), continue close monitoring if BP is below threshold, and repeat BP measurement in 20 minutes. If a threshold is still exceeded thereafter, administer labetalol (20 mg IV for more than 2 minutes), continue close monitoring if below threshold, and repeat BP measurement in 10 minutes; if still exceeded, administer labetalol (40 mg IV for more than 2 minutes) and obtain emergency consultation from maternal–fetal medicine, internal medicine, anesthesia, or critical care subspecialists, with additional antihypertensive medication per specific order. After BP thresholds are achieved, repeat BP measurement every 10 minutes for 1 hour, then every 15 minutes for 1 hour, then every 30 minutes for 1 hour, and then every hour for 4 hours, and institute additional BP timing per specific order; please note there may be adverse effects and contraindications.

A woman with chronic hypertension should be evaluated prepregnancy to identify possible end-organ involvement, to consider evaluation for secondary hypertension, and for the optimization of maternal comorbidities before pregnancy. It is recommended to maintain blood pressure levels for pregnant women with chronic hypertension treated with antihypertensive medications at or above 120 mm Hg but below 160 mm Hg systolic and at or above 80 mm Hg but below 110 mm Hg diastolic. Antenatal fetal testing is recommended for women with chronic hypertension complicated by issues such as medication need, other medical conditions affecting fetal outcome, any evidence of fetal growth restriction, or superimposed preeclampsia. The risks of fetal growth restriction in patients with chronic hypertension warrant third-trimester ultrasound assessment of fetal growth with subsequent evaluation as appropriate.

Blood pressure treatment targets during pregnancy

A wealth of epidemiologic evidence supports higher risk for adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes in the setting of chronic hypertension. However, a key challenge in managing pregnant individuals with chronic hypertension has been the uncertainty in BP treatment targets, which vary across society guidelines. This is particularly true given that there has not been good evidence to this point that treatment of mild chronic hypertension improves health outcomes and some evidence that it reduces birth weight. Thus, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists guidelines had recommended treatment when systolic blood pressure (SBP) ≥ 160 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) ≥ 110 mmHg. In contrast, the European Society of Cardiology guidelines had stricter thresholds and recommended treatment when SBP ≥ 140 mmHg or DBP ≥ 90 mmHg. In nonpregnant individuals, the American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association guidelines cutoffs for the management of hypertension have an entirely different strategy, recommending not only reclassification but also management of stage 1 hypertension from 140/90 mmHg to < 130/80 mmHg with antihypertensives. While treatment of BP does provide therapeutic control, the lack of data on preventing adverse pregnancy outcomes and the potential for harm related to reduced uteroplacental blood flow and fetal growth restriction has led to hesitation to lower BP treatment targets in pregnancy. Thus, the treatment thresholds of chronic hypertension in pregnancy vary from what the cardiovascular community uses in the rest of the adult population.

### SMFM statement: benefit of antihypertensive therapy for mild-to-moderate chronic hypertension during pregnancy remains uncertain [^1174T5Bn]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2015). Low credibility.

Chronic hypertension is present in up to 5% of pregnant women and constitutes a major cause of maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality. The purpose of this document is to summarize the current recommendations regarding use of antihypertensive medications during pregnancy for women with mild-to-moderate chronic hypertension in the setting of the recently published Control of Hypertension in Pregnancy Study (CHIPS). The recently published CHIPS trial was a multicenter international randomized controlled trial comparing "less tight control" to "tight control" of blood pressure for pregnant women with hypertension. The most updated recommendations regarding management of pregnant women with hypertension are found from the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists Task Force on Hypertension in Pregnancy, which are endorsed by the Society of Maternal-Fetal Medicine (SMFM). SMFM recommends that clinicians continue to follow existing guidelines for management of pregnant women with mild-to-moderate chronic hypertension due to the fact that the benefits and risks of pharmacologic treatment for these women remain uncertain, and adequately powered randomized controlled trials are needed to address the less common but clinically significant nonsurrogate perinatal outcomes.

Multidisciplinary approach and pharmacological intervention

Optimal management of HDP requires collaboration between obstetricians, internal medicine specialists, cardiologists and general practitioners since guidelines for diagnosis and therapy are evolving and recommendations for therapy vary across societies. Beta‐blockers, a first‐line therapy option, have been suspected to impair foetal growth. However, in the CHAP study, an open‐label randomized controlled trial on antihypertensive therapy with a goal BP of < 140/90 mmHg in patients with non‐severe chronic hypertension, treatment reduced the frequency of adverse outcomes without increasing the frequency of intrauterine growth retardation in all except those with severe obesity. In this study, women enrolled prior to 24 weeks of gestation derived the most benefit. Based on these findings, the ACOG supports implementing therapy with a BP of > 140/90 mmHg (Figure 4). Whether this translates to prevention of CVD in later life is not yet known.

Figure 4
Approach to hypertension in pregnancy. Different societies vary in definition of chronic hypertension. AHA/ACC 2017 guidelines define Stage 1 hypertension as > 130/80 mmHg and Stage 2 as > 140/90 mmHg. ISSHP and ESC 2018 define hypertension as > 140/90 mmHg. Women with chronic hypertension planning pregnancy should consider transitioning to a medication safe with pregnancy. For women without evidence for end‐organ damage traditional target goals for therapy are reasonable. In presence of end‐organ damage, tighter control is recommended. For women developing gestational hypertension, traditionally medication is started if blood pressure (BP) nears severe range. Based on the recent CHAP study, earlier therapy initiation should be considered.

Tailored blood pressure management to improve obstetric outcome

Earlier disappointing effects of antihypertensive medication can be anticipated when the pharmacological mode of action does not match the underlying haemodynamic imbalance. In fact, hypertension in pregnancy may result from (i) high cardiac output, low vascular resistance state, in which beta‐blockade is expected to be most effective, or (ii) low cardiac output, high vascular resistance state where dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers or central‐acting alpha agonists might be the best corrective medication. In the latter, beta‐blockade might be maternally ineffective and even contribute to impaired foetal growth by keeping cardiac output low. A recent study showed that tailored circulatory normalization of non‐physiological haemodynamic changes during pregnancy halves the risk of recurrent preeclampsia, without disadvantageous effects on offspring outcome.

Calcium-channel blockers

Dihydropyridine calcium-channel blockers (CCB) are also a first-line treatment in hypertension. The CCB are the only first-line drug class that can be initiated without knowledge and timely follow-up of electrolyte status and kidney function, making them a convenient choice when follow-up scheduling is challenging. The vasodilating effects of CCB can cause adverse effects encompassing dizziness, flushing, headache and tibial edema, which women are more likely to experience. Calcium-channel blockers, especially nifedipine, are safe to use during pregnancy. They are also a suitable choice for treating Raynaud phenomenon, which is more prevalent in women.

Thiazides

Thiazide-type and thiazide-like diuretics are also a first-line treatment in hypertension. Thiazide treatment is associated with a reduced risk of osteoporotic fractures, which predominantly afflict women. However, observational studies have suggested that this effect may, perhaps surprisingly, be clinically more discernible in men. One explanation to this finding could be that fracture risk in general is noticeably higher in women, and the fracture-protecting effect of thiazides might be ruled out by other more potent negative factors in women. Thiazides are also a first-line, pharmacological treatment option in patients with recurrent calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis who exhibit hyper-calciuria. Calcium-oxalate stones are the most frequent cause of nephrolithiasis and men are afflicted twice as often as women.

Hypokalemia and hyponatremia are frequent adverse effects of thiazides, which seem to afflict women to a greater degree than men, while men are more likely to develop hyperuricemia and gout. Men are also more likely to experience sexual dysfunction during thiazide treatment, primarily in the form of erectile dysfunction. Thiazides are rarely used in pregnancy due to risk of decreased placental perfusion and the decreased plasma volume associated with preeclampsia.

### Nonsevere hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and oral antihypertensive medications: an argument in favor of use [^117UizKc]. American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology MFM (2025). Medium credibility.

Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy are a common complication of pregnancy and a major contributor to both immediate and long-term morbidity and mortality. Recent data support the treatment of chronic hypertension during pregnancy to a blood pressure goal of < 140/90 mmHg. Treatment of severe range blood pressures (≥ 160/110 mmHg) in the setting of gestational hypertension is recommended to prevent severe morbidity and mortality; however, there remains clinical equipoise regarding treatment of gestational hypertension with blood pressures ≥ 140/90 but < 160/110. While there is limited data to support the treatment of gestational hypertension, we believe that treatment of gestational hypertension to a blood pressure of < 140/90, similar to the recommendations for chronic hypertension, will lead to a reduction in severe maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality related to hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. In this expert review, we summarize the available data regarding the treatment of gestational hypertension and offer recommendations for the treatment of gestational hypertension based on our clinical experience.

### Antihypertensive drug therapy for mild to moderate hypertension during pregnancy [^117G1vkA]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Mild to moderate hypertension during pregnancy is common. Antihypertensive drugs are often used in the belief that lowering blood pressure will prevent progression to more severe disease, and thereby improve outcome.

Objectives

To assess the effects of antihypertensive drug treatments for women with mild to moderate hypertension during pregnancy.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (March 2006), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library 2005, Issue 3), MEDLINE (1966 to November 2005), LILACS (1984 to November 2005) and EMBASE (1974 to November 2005).

Selection Criteria

All randomised trials evaluating any antihypertensive drug treatment for mild to moderate hypertension during pregnancy defined, whenever possible, as systolic blood pressure 140 to 169 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure 90 to 109 mmHg. Comparisons were of one or more antihypertensive drug(s) with placebo, with no antihypertensive drug, or with another antihypertensive drug, and where treatment was planned to continue for at least seven days.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data.

Main Results

Forty-six trials (4282 women) were included. Twenty-eight trials compared an antihypertensive drug with placebo/no antihypertensive drug (3200 women). There is a halving in the risk of developing severe hypertension associated with the use of antihypertensive drug(s) (19 trials, 2409 women; relative risk (RR) 0.50; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.41 to 0.61; risk difference (RD) -0.10 (-0.12 to -0.07); number needed to treat (NNT) 10 (8 to 13)) but little evidence of a difference in the risk of pre-eclampsia (22 trials, 2702 women; RR 0.97; 95% CI 0.83 to 1.13). Similarly, there is no clear effect on the risk of the baby dying (26 trials, 3081 women; RR 0.73; 95% CI 0.50 to 1.08), preterm birth (14 trials, 1992 women; RR 1.02; 95% CI 0.89 to 1.16), or small-for-gestational-age babies (19 trials, 2437 women; RR 1.04; 95% CI 0.84 to 1.27). There were no clear differences in any other outcomes. Nineteen trials (1282 women) compared one antihypertensive drug with another. Beta blockers seem better than methyldopa for reducing the risk of severe hypertension (10 trials, 539 women, RR 0.75 (95% CI 0.59 to 0.94); RD -0.08 (-0.14 to 0.02); NNT 12 (6 to 275)). There is no clear difference between any of the alternative drugs in the risk of developing proteinuria/pre-eclampsia. Other outcomes were only reported by a small proportion of studies, and there were no clear differences.

Authors' Conclusions

It remains unclear whether antihypertensive drug therapy for mild to moderate hypertension during pregnancy is worthwhile.

Key Points for Practice
- Medical treatment of chronic hypertension in pregnancy, that is, hypertension present before 20 weeks' gestation, is recommended at 160 mm Hg systolic or 110 mm Hg diastolic with labetalol or extended-release nifedipine, treating to 120 to 159 mm Hg systolic and 80 to 109 mm Hg diastolic. Antihypertensive medications safe for the treatment of chronic hypertension during pregnancy include: Labetalol, two times daily up to 2, 400 mg per day in women without asthma, myocardial disease, decreased cardiac function, heart block, or bradycardia; Extended-release nifedipine, up to 120 mg daily in women without tachycardia;. Methyldopa, two or three times daily up to 3, 000 mg per day; or Hydrochlorothiazide, 12. 5 to 25 mg daily. Labetalol and nifedipine are the preferred medications and hydrochlorothiazide and methyldopa are considered secondary options. Methyldopa has a long history of use in pregnancy, but has limited effectiveness and significant adverse effects.

Use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, renin inhibitors, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists should be avoided in pregnancy. STRONG EVIDENCE Women with chronic hypertension should take 81 mg of aspirin daily from 12 to 28 weeks' gestation until delivery. LIMITED EVIDENCE Blood pressure control in pregnancy is challenging because of the uncertain risks of mild hypertension and potential uteroplacental insufficiency with overtreatment. Pregnant women with chronic hypertension should start antihypertensive medication when their blood pressure reaches 160 mm Hg systolic or 110 mm Hg diastolic, although it may be initiated earlier if the patient has concerning comorbidities or impaired renal function. Acute hypertensive episodes in pregnancy can be dangerous to mother and infant.

Pregnant women presenting with blood pressures higher than 160 mm Hg systolic or 110 mm Hg diastolic for 15 minutes should be given an antihypertensive medication as soon as possible, but at least within one hour. Women with severe acute hypertension resistant to medical treatment or superimposed preeclampsia with severe features who are at 34 weeks' gestation or more should proceed to delivery.

### Management of severe hypertension in pregnancy [^112t8ZC2]. Seminars in Perinatology (2016). Low credibility.

While hemorrhage is the leading cause of maternal death in most of the world, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy are the leading cause of maternal mortality in the United States. The opportunity to improve outcomes lies in timely and appropriate response to severe hypertension. The purpose of this article is to review the diagnostic criteria for severe hypertension, choice of antihypertensive agents, and recommended algorithms for evaluation and management of acute changes in clinical status. Adhering to standard practices ensures that care teams can timely and appropriate care to these high risk patients. With heightened surveillance and prompt evaluation of signs and symptoms of worsening hypertension, maternal morbidity and mortality can be decreased.

### ACOG practice bulletin no. 203: chronic hypertension in pregnancy [^111V1JYb]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). High credibility.

Chronic hypertension in pregnancy — acute-onset severe hypertension thresholds and timing: Antihypertensive treatment should be initiated expeditiously for acute-onset, severe hypertension (systolic blood pressure of 160 mm Hg or more or diastolic blood pressure of 110 mm Hg or more) that is confirmed as persistent (15 minutes or more). The available literature suggests that antihypertensive agents should be administered within 30–60 minutes; it is recommended to administer antihypertensive therapy as soon as reasonably possible after the criteria for acute-onset severe hypertension are met, and evidence suggests that therapy should be initiated within 60 minutes. If blood pressure remains elevated after initiating antihypertensive therapy or for initial blood pressure elevations of 180 mm Hg or more systolic or 120 mm Hg or more diastolic, this represents further and ongoing risk of severe maternal morbidity and mortality and requires accelerated maternal and obstetric evaluation and decision making by the obstetric care provider.

Severe-range hypertension in pregnancy — acute management — defines severe hypertension as SBP ≥ 160 mm Hg or DBP ≥ 110 mm Hg; Table 23 describes preferred agents, doses, and routes for expeditious treatment. Immediate-release oral nifedipine has been shown in a meta-analysis to be associated with faster time to achieve target BP specifically in pregnancy, although it is not generally recommended for the acute treatment of other types of hypertension.

### Chronic hypertension in pregnancy: new concepts for classification and management [^113Mqrie]. American Journal of Perinatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Chronic hypertension in pregnancy is traditionally classified according to degree of blood pressure (BP) elevation. Alternatively, stratifying women as high or low risk based on the etiology of hypertension, baseline work-up, and comorbid medical conditions will better inform clinicians about thresholds to initiate antihypertensive therapy, target BPs, frequency of antepartum visits, and timing of delivery. Women classified as high-risk chronic hypertension as described here require stricter BP management and more frequent follow-up visits as their associated rates of adverse maternal and/or fetal/neonatal outcomes appear higher than women classified as low-risk chronic hypertension. The latter group can in most cases be managed similarly to the general obstetric population.

### Summary of the NHLBI working group on research on hypertension during pregnancy [^1155EPqF]. Hypertension (2003). Low credibility.

A Working Group on Research in Hypertension in Pregnancy was recently convened by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute to determine the state of knowledge in this area and suggest appropriate directions for research. Hypertensive disorders in pregnancy, especially preeclampsia, are a leading cause of maternal death worldwide and even in developed countries increase perinatal mortality rates 5-fold. Much has been learned about preeclampsia, but gaps in the knowledge necessary to direct therapeutic strategies remain. Oxidative stress is a biologically plausible contributor to the disorder that may be amenable to intervention. Hypertension that antedates pregnancy (chronic hypertension) bears many similarities to hypertension in nonpregnant women, but the special setting of pregnancy demands information to guide evidence-based therapy. The recommendations of the Working Group are to attempt a clinical trial of antioxidant therapy to prevent preeclampsia that is be complemented by mechanistic research to increase understanding of the genetics and pathogenesis of the disorder. For chronic hypertension, clinical trials are recommended to direct choice of drugs, evaluate degree of control, and assess implications to the mother and fetus. Recommendations to increase participation in this research are also presented.

### Antihypertensive drug therapy for mild to moderate hypertension during pregnancy [^111QZHHo]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Mild to moderate hypertension during pregnancy is common. Antihypertensive drugs are often used in the belief that lowering blood pressure will prevent progression to more severe disease, and thereby improve the outcome.

Objectives

To assess the effects of antihypertensive drug treatments for women with mild to moderate hypertension during pregnancy.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (30 April 2013) and reference lists of retrieved studies.

Selection Criteria

All randomised trials evaluating any antihypertensive drug treatment for mild to moderate hypertension during pregnancy defined, whenever possible, as systolic blood pressure 140 to 169 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure 90 to 109 mmHg. Comparisons were of one or more antihypertensive drug(s) with placebo, with no antihypertensive drug, or with another antihypertensive drug, and where treatment was planned to continue for at least seven days.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data.

Main Results

Forty-nine trials (4723 women) were included. Twenty-nine trials compared an antihypertensive drug with placebo/no antihypertensive drug (3350 women). There is a halving in the risk of developing severe hypertension associated with the use of antihypertensive drug(s) (20 trials, 2558 women; risk ratio (RR) 0.49; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.40 to 0.60; risk difference (RD) -0.10 (-0.13 to -0.07); number needed to treat to harm (NNTH) 10 (8 to 13)) but little evidence of a difference in the risk of pre-eclampsia (23 trials, 2851 women; RR 0.93; 95% CI 0.80 to 1.08). Similarly, there is no clear effect on the risk of the baby dying (27 trials, 3230 women; RR 0.71; 95% CI 0.49 to 1.02), preterm birth (15 trials, 2141 women; RR 0.96; 95% CI 0.85 to 1.10), or small-for-gestational-age babies (20 trials, 2586 women; RR 0.97; 95% CI 0.80 to 1.17). There were no clear differences in any other outcomes. Twenty-two trials (1723 women) compared one antihypertensive drug with another. Alternative drugs seem better than methyldopa for reducing the risk of severe hypertension (11 trials, 638 women; RR (random-effects) 0.54; 95% CI 0.30 to 0.95; RD -0.11 (-0.20 to -0.02); NNTH 7 (5 to 69)). There is also a reduction in the overall risk of developing proteinuria/pre-eclampsia when beta blockers and calcium channel blockers considered together are compared with methyldopa (11 trials, 997 women; RR 0.73; 95% CI 0.54 to 0.99). However, the effect on both severe hypertension and proteinuria is not seen in the individual drugs. Other outcomes were only reported by a small proportion of studies, and there were no clear differences.

Authors' Conclusions

It remains unclear whether antihypertensive drug therapy for mild to moderate hypertension during pregnancy is worthwhile.
