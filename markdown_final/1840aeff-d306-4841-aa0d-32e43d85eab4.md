## Question

What is the recommended dosing range of zanitrel for hypertension?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for the recommended dosing range of "zanitrel" for hypertension. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether "zanitrel" is an actual drug name or a misspelling. Then, I should verify the closest sound-alike antihypertensives and check their FDA-labeled dosing. Next, I will examine whether any similarly named drug is actually not an antihypertensive and could cause hypotension, which would change the counseling. Finally, I should provide a safe, reference-based answer and ask for clarification to avoid a dosing error, cross-checking FDA labels for lisinopril (Zestril) and tizanidine (Zanaflex) to anchor the reasoning plan [^115B51dd] [^115AnC3u].

> Let me first confirm the identity of "zanitrel". Wait, let me verify the document set and common databases: I do not find any approved drug called "zanitrel", and there are zero matches in the provided materials, which makes me suspect a misspelling or brand/generic confusion [^115B51dd]. Hold on, I should verify potential sound-alikes: "Zanaflex" (tizanidine) looks phonetically similar, but it is a central alpha2-agonist indicated for spasticity, not for treating hypertension, and it can cause clinically significant hypotension and even rebound hypertension if stopped abruptly, particularly with CYP1A2 inhibitors such as fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin and in combination with antihypertensives, so using it to treat hypertension would be inappropriate and potentially dangerous [^115AnC3u] [^114qfPUS] [^112srRjc] [^115D1U6f]. I should also note the reported hypotension when tizanidine was added to an ACE inhibitor in a pediatric case, reinforcing the risk of additive blood pressure lowering rather than antihypertensive efficacy [^112NYAzW].

> But wait, what if the intended name was "Zestril", the lisinopril brand commonly used for hypertension — this would fit the clinical context much better. I should double-check the labeled dosing: for adults with hypertension, the usual starting dose is 10 mg once daily, with a typical maintenance range of 20 to 40 mg daily and a maximum studied dose of 80 mg daily; importantly, if the patient is on a diuretic, starting at 5 mg daily is recommended to mitigate first-dose hypotension, and pediatric dosing (≥ 6 years, GFR > 30 mL/min/1.73 m²) starts at 0.07 mg/kg up to 5 mg once daily, titrating to a maximum of 0.61 mg/kg (up to 40 mg) once daily, all consistent with FDA labeling and pharmacodynamic data showing onset within an hour and peak effect around 6 hours with additive effects when combined with thiazides [^115B51dd] [^114rpH7p] [^112K2r9p] [^113UkTRh]. Hold on, I should verify the clinical nuance: lisinopril is often somewhat less effective in Black patients as monotherapy, which can guide combination choices, but dosing ranges remain as above and are titrated to blood pressure response and tolerability [^113UkTRh].

> I need to check whether there is any similarly named antihypertensive that could be intended besides lisinopril; enalapril/enalaprilat come to mind, but "zanitrel" still does not align with those names. If the clinical scenario involves a need for intravenous ACE inhibitor therapy, enalaprilat is dosed at 1.25 mg IV every 6 hours (up to 5 mg IV every 6 hours used short-term in studies), which is a different route and context than an oral outpatient regimen and would only be relevant if the user meant an IV alternative rather than an oral agent like lisinopril [^114Uffis]. Let me reconsider: none of these resolve to "zanitrel", which strengthens the likelihood of a misspelling rather than a niche brand name [^114Uffis].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions without contrasting with other alpha-2 agonists that are actually antihypertensives; guanfacine (Tenex) and clonidine are indicated for hypertension, but abrupt withdrawal — especially with clonidine — can cause rebound hypertension, and neither name matches "zanitrel", again making tizanidine a poor fit for this question and reinforcing the lisinopril hypothesis if hypertension dosing was intended [^1162RCnc] [^115rX8JJ]. I should confirm: this comparison underscores why tizanidine should not be used for hypertension, whereas lisinopril would be standard-of-care for many patients if "Zestril" was the intended drug name [^115AnC3u] [^115B51dd].

> Putting this together, I need to ensure patient safety: I cannot provide a dosing range for "zanitrel" because no such antihypertensive appears in the provided evidence; if the intended drug is Zestril (lisinopril), the typical adult range is 10 mg once daily initially with 20–40 mg once daily for maintenance (max 80 mg daily), or 5 mg once daily to start if on a diuretic, with pediatric dosing and titration as above; if the intended drug was actually Zanaflex (tizanidine), it is not an antihypertensive and can precipitate hypotension and drug–drug interactions, so it should not be used to treat hypertension; please confirm the exact drug name and context so I can finalize a precise dosing recommendation tailored to concomitant therapies, renal function, and blood pressure targets [^115B51dd] [^113UkTRh] [^114rpH7p] [^115AnC3u] [^114qfPUS].

I **cannot find** a medication named "zanitrel". Did you mean one of the following:

- **Zanaflex (tizanidine)**? It is not indicated for hypertension and can cause hypotension [^115AnC3u] [^112NYAzW]; avoid with CYP1A2 inhibitors like ciprofloxacin/fluvoxamine [^114qfPUS].
- **Zestril (lisinopril)**? Typical adult hypertension dose is 10–40 mg [^115B51dd] once daily [^1153XTfh].
- **Enalaprilat (IV)**? 1.25 mg every 6 hours [^114Uffis] for hypertension.

Please confirm the exact **drug name** and **indication** so I can provide the correct dosage range.

### Zanaflex [^115AnC3u]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Zanaflex, a tizanidine compound, functions as an α2-adrenergic agonist and can induce hypotension. Syncope has been recorded post-marketing. The likelihood of significant hypotension may be reduced through careful dose titration and monitoring for signs and symptoms of hypotension prior to increasing the dose. Additionally, patients transitioning from a supine to a fixed upright position may face an elevated risk for hypotension and orthostatic effects.

For patients undergoing antihypertensive therapy, monitor for hypotension when Zanaflex is administered. It is advised against the concurrent use of Zanaflex with other α2-adrenergic agonists. Clinically significant hypotension, characterized by decreases in both systolic and diastolic pressure, has been reported with the concomitant administration of either fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin with single doses of 4 mg of Zanaflex. Therefore, the concomitant use of Zanaflex with fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin, which are potent inhibitors of CYP1A2, is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7.1, 7.2)].

Zanaflex may also cause hepatocellular liver injury; therefore, caution is advised in patients with any hepatic impairment. Monitoring aminotransferase levels is recommended at baseline and one month after achieving the maximum dose, or if hepatic injury is suspected [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.7)].

Moreover, Zanaflex can lead to sedation, potentially disrupting daily activities. In multiple-dose studies, the prevalence of patients experiencing sedation peaked.

### Zanaflex [^114qfPUS]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Concomitant use of fluvoxamine and Zanaflex is contraindicated. Changes in the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine when administered with fluvoxamine resulted in significantly decreased blood pressure, increased drowsiness, and increased psychomotor impairment [see Contraindications (4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Concomitant use of ciprofloxacin and Zanaflex is also contraindicated. Similarly, changes in the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine when taken with ciprofloxacin resulted in significantly decreased blood pressure, increased drowsiness, and increased psychomotor impairment [see Contraindications (4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

- **CYP1A2 inhibitors other than fluvoxamine and ciprofloxacin**: Due to potential drug interactions, avoid using Zanaflex with CYP1A2 inhibitors such as zileuton, fluoroquinolones other than strong CYP1A2 inhibitors (which are contraindicated), antiarrhythmics (amiodarone, mexiletine, propafenone, and verapamil), cimetidine, famotidine, oral contraceptives, acyclovir, and ticlopidine. If their use is clinically necessary, initiate therapy with a 2 mg dose, increasing in 2–4 mg steps daily based on patient response. If adverse reactions such as hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness occur, reduce or discontinue Zanaflex therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

- **Oral contraceptives**: Concomitant use of Zanaflex with oral contraceptives is not recommended. However, if concomitant use is clinically necessary…

### Zestril [^115B51dd]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Hypertension in adults**: The recommended initial dose is 10 mg once a day. Dosage should be adjusted according to blood pressure response. The usual dosage range is 20 mg to 40 mg per day administered in a single daily dose. Doses up to 80 mg have been used but do not appear to give greater effect.

- **Use with diuretics in adults**: If blood pressure is not controlled with Zestril alone, a low dose of a diuretic may be added (e.g. hydrochlorothiazide, 12.5 mg). After the addition of a diuretic, it may be possible to reduce the dose of Zestril. The recommended starting dose in adult patients with hypertension taking diuretics is 5 mg once per day.

- **Pediatric patients (6 years of age and older) with hypertension**: For pediatric patients with a glomerular filtration rate greater than 30 mL/min/1.73 m², the recommended starting dose is 0.07 mg per kg once daily (up to 5 mg total). Dosage should be adjusted according to blood pressure response, up to a maximum of 0.61 mg per kg (up to 40 mg) once daily. Doses above 0.61 mg per kg (or in excess of 40 mg) have not been studied in pediatric patients.

Zestril is not recommended in pediatric patients younger than 6 years or in pediatric patients with a glomerular filtration rate less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m².

- **Heart failure**: The recommended starting dose for Zestril, when used with diuretics and (usually) digitalis as adjunctive therapy for systolic heart failure, is 5 mg once daily.

### Enalaprilat [^114Uffis]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Dosage and administration: Intravenous administration only**. The dose for hypertension is 1.25 mg every six hours, administered intravenously over a five-minute period. A clinical response is usually observed within 15 minutes. Peak effects after the first dose may not occur for up to four hours. The peak effects of the second and subsequent doses may exceed those of the first. No dosage regimen for enalaprilat injection has been clearly demonstrated to be more effective in treating hypertension than 1.25 mg every six hours. However, controlled clinical studies in hypertension have shown that doses as high as 5 mg every six hours are well tolerated for up to 36 hours. There has been inadequate experience with doses greater than 20 mg per day.

	- In studies of patients with hypertension, enalaprilat has not been administered for periods longer than 48 hours. In other studies, patients have received enalaprilat for as long as seven days. The dose for patients being converted to enalaprilat injection from oral therapy for hypertension with enalapril maleate is 1.25 mg every six hours. For conversion from intravenous to oral therapy, the recommended initial dose of oral enalapril maleate is 5 mg once a day, with subsequent dosage adjustments as necessary.

- **Patients on diuretic therapy**: For patients on diuretic therapy, the recommended starting dose for hypertension is 0.625 mg, administered intravenously over a five-minute period. Also see below, patients at risk of excessive hypotension. A clinical response is usually seen within 15 minutes. Peak effects after the first dose may…

### Trandolapril [^114c9u6v]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

Four placebo-controlled dose-response studies were conducted using once-daily oral dosing of trandolapril in doses from 0.25 to 16 mg per day in 827 black and non-black patients with mild to moderate hypertension. The minimal effective once-daily dose was 1 mg in non-black patients and 2 mg in black patients. Further decreases in trough supine diastolic blood pressure were obtained in non-black patients with higher doses, with no further response seen with doses above 4 mg (up to 16 mg). The antihypertensive effect diminished somewhat at the end of the dosing interval, but trough/peak ratios were well above 50% for all effective doses. There was a slightly greater effect on the diastolic pressure, but no difference in systolic pressure with b.i.d. dosing. During chronic therapy, the maximum reduction in blood pressure with any dose is achieved within one week.

Following six weeks of monotherapy in placebo-controlled trials in patients with mild to moderate hypertension, once-daily doses of 2 to 4 mg lowered supine or standing systolic/diastolic blood pressure 24 hours after dosing by an average of 7 to 10/4 to 5 mmHg below placebo responses in non-black patients. Once-daily doses of 2 to 4 mg lowered blood pressure by 4 to 6/3 to 4 mmHg in black patients. Trough to peak ratios for effective doses ranged from 0.5 to 0.9. There were no differences in response between men and women, but responses were somewhat greater in patients under 60 than in those over 60 years old. Abrupt withdrawal of trandolapril has not been associated with a rapid increase in blood pressure.

### Targeting the sympathetic nervous system with the selective imidazoline receptor agonist moxonidine for the management of hypertension: an international position statement [^115s95AF]. Journal of Hypertension (2024). Low credibility.

- **Clinical implications**: Blood pressure can be controlled by targeting different pathophysiological mechanisms. Targeting the adrenergic system with beta blockers has its own limitations, such as tolerability issues and adverse metabolic effects. Targeting the sympathetic nervous system (SNS), especially in obese patients and those with metabolic syndromes and other relevant co-morbidities previously highlighted, could be an important strategy. However, there is a need to create awareness among treating physicians regarding SNS modulation.

Although hard outcome data in hypertension are not available, moxonidine lowers high blood pressure (BP). Studies have compared it with various other drugs used to treat hypertension, including clonidine, diuretics, drugs that block both α receptors and β receptors, calcium antagonists, and ACE inhibitors. The study results demonstrated that the effectiveness of moxonidine in reducing BP was similar to other drugs. Moreover, moxonidine has a favorable side effect profile and is generally well tolerated.

Due to the potentially relevant additional metabolic benefits of selective imidazoline receptor agonists (SIRAs), experts recommend moxonidine be considered as part of a therapeutic combination regimen for special populations where SNS overactivation is evident. They also recommend its inclusion in standard algorithms for treating uncontrolled hypertension as an add-on therapy, along with first-line antihypertensives.

### Blood pressure lowering efficacy of renin inhibitors for primary hypertension [^114o2Z1R]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). High credibility.

Hypertension is a chronic condition associated with an increased risk of mortality and morbidity. The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system is an important target site for five antihypertensive drug classes: beta blockers, renin inhibitors, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), and aldosterone inhibitors. Renin is the enzyme responsible for converting angiotensinogen to angiotensin I, which is then converted to angiotensin II. Renin inhibitors prevent the formation of both angiotensin I and angiotensin II. Notably, renin inhibitors do not affect kinin metabolism and may produce fewer adverse effects than ACE inhibitors, such as dry cough or angioedema.

- **Objectives**: To quantify the dose-related blood pressure lowering efficacy of renin inhibitors versus placebo in the treatment of primary hypertension.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the following databases for randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of renin inhibitors: Medline (1966-March 2008), EMBASE (1988-March 2008), Cochrane CENTRAL, and bibliographic citations from retrieved references. No language restrictions were applied.

- **Selection criteria**: Study design had to meet the following criteria: double-blinded, placebo-controlled; random allocation to a specific dose of renin inhibitor group and parallel placebo group; and a duration of follow-up of at least three weeks.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed trial quality using risk of bias tables. Disagreements were resolved by discussion or a third reviewer. Data synthesis and analyses were performed using appropriate statistical methods.

### Distinguishing the antihypertensive and electrolyte effects of eplerenone [^1112kDQp]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2004). Low credibility.

In two clinical trials investigating the antihypertensive effects of the mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist eplerenone, 397 patients with essential hypertension were dose-titrated (50, 100, and 200 mg/d) over successive 4-week periods until they reached target blood pressure levels. Of the total participants, 44% reached the target on 50 mg/d, 17% on 100 mg/d, and 19% on 200 mg/d. However, 20% failed to attain the target blood pressure despite stepwise dose increases.

- **Findings**: At each dose level, three major findings emerged upon comparing responders (those who reached the target) with nonresponders:
	- **Blood pressure reduction**: Responders experienced a significant reduction in blood pressure (systolic, 16–20 mm Hg; diastolic, approximately 15 mm Hg) compared to nonresponders (systolic, 2–5 mm Hg; diastolic, 1–3 mm Hg).
	- **Varied sensitivity**: There was a wide variation in sensitivity to eplerenone across the population, in terms of blood pressure reduction.
	- **Plasma [K+] levels**: No difference was observed in plasma [K+] levels between responders and nonresponders at any dose level.

These data suggest that the significant antihypertensive effect of eplerenone operates through mechanisms other than those involving epithelial electrolyte and fluid transport. The modest mean elevation in plasma [K+] (≤ 0.2 mEq/liter at 200 mg/d) indicates that titration to effect, rather than forced titration, may reduce the risk of hyperkalemia, even at relatively high doses (100–200 mg/d) of eplerenone.

### Pharmacotherapy for hypertension in adults aged 18 to 59 years [^116gxaYu]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Hypertension is an important risk factor for adverse cardiovascular events, including stroke, myocardial infarction, heart failure, and renal failure. The main goal of treatment is to reduce these events. Systematic reviews have shown the proven benefit of antihypertensive drug therapy in reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality; however, most of the evidence pertains to individuals aged 60 years and older. This study seeks to understand the effects of antihypertensive therapy in people aged 18 to 59 years.

- **Objectives**: To quantify antihypertensive drug effects on all-cause mortality in adults aged 18 to 59 years with mild to moderate primary hypertension, and to quantify effects on cardiovascular mortality and morbidity (including cerebrovascular and coronary heart disease mortality and morbidity), withdrawal due to adverse events, and the estimated magnitude of systolic and diastolic blood pressure lowering at one year.

- **Search methods**: The Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomized controlled trials up to January 2017: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials.gov. We contacted authors of relevant papers regarding further published and unpublished work.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized trials of at least one year's duration, comparing antihypertensive pharmacotherapy with a placebo or no treatment in adults aged 18 to 59 years.

### What do people really think of generic medicines? A systematic review and critical appraisal of literature on stakeholder perceptions of generic drugs [^1149sWf5]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Generic medicines are those where the original patent has expired and which may now be produced by manufacturers other than the original innovator (patent-holding) company. The term 'generic drug' or 'generic medicine' is commonly understood, as defined by the World Health Organization (WHO), to mean a pharmaceutical product that is usually intended to be interchangeable with an innovator product, is manufactured without a license from the innovator company, and is marketed after the expiry date of the patent or other exclusive rights.

Other definitions of generic medicines may be subtly different. For example, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) defines a generic as: "A drug product that is comparable to a brand/reference listed drug product in dosage form, strength, route of administration, quality and performance characteristics, and intended use"; and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) definition is: "A generic medicine is a medicine that is developed to be the same as a medicine that has already been authorised (the 'reference medicine'). A generic medicine contains the same active substance(s) as the reference medicine, and it is used at the same dose(s) to treat the same disease(s) as the reference medicine. However, the name of the medicine, its appearance (such as colour or shape), and its packaging can be different from those of the reference medicine".

However, all agree on the general requirements that the product is off-patent, contains an active ingredient in a previously approved medicine, and is shown to be bioequivalent to that previously approved medicine.

### Beta-blockers for hypertension [^114NbSxd]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Proper understanding of the evidence for beta-blocker therapy in hypertension requires a regularly updated systematic, comprehensive, and appropriate analysis of all currently available data. In 2007, we published a Cochrane Review which re-assessed the place of beta-blockers as first-line therapy for hypertension relative to each of the other major classes of antihypertensive drugs. An update of the review was published in 2012. The review is an update of the 2012 review.

### Clinical overview of hypertension and emerging treatment considerations [^115ogRoy]. American Journal of Hypertension (2001). Low credibility.

Managing hypertension is a complex undertaking, where even the definition of the disorder is subject to discussion. Recently, there has been controversy concerning the most appropriate measure to determine health risks associated with hypertension. In the past, diastolic blood pressure (DBP) was the prime measure for defining hypertension, but currently systolic blood pressure (SBP) and pulse pressure have gained favor. Evidence now suggests that all three measures should be considered as part of the hypertensive profile, with the patient's age determining the relative importance of each.

Aggressive treatment of hypertension may reduce morbidity and mortality. Data from trials clearly indicate that, for all stages of hypertension, the goal should be a maximum SBP of < 150 mm Hg and a DBP of < 90 mm Hg, with DBP values as low as 70 mm Hg being safe. For individuals with diabetes mellitus, these target values should be even lower — SBP < 140 mm Hg and DBP < 80 mm Hg.

As a significant number of deaths attributable to hypertension occur in patients who are not diagnosed as hypertensive but whose blood pressure (BP) is above the optimal level of 120/80 mm Hg, lowering BP levels in this group is recommended as well, with lifestyle modification being first-line therapy. Because controlling BP to < 140/90 mm Hg often requires the use of two or three agents, the tolerability of the entire regimen must be considered. However, with the multitude of antihypertensive drugs currently available, no patient's BP should remain above the 150/90 mm Hg level.

### Substandard drugs among five common antihypertensive generic medications: An analysis from 10 African countries [^111Qjn4f]. Journal of Hypertension (2018). Low credibility.

Hypertension results in more deaths than any other risk factor and has been on the rise in sub-Saharan Africa over the past few decades. Generic drugs have helped improve the accessibility and affordability of antihypertensive therapy in developing countries. However, the assessment of quality standards of these products is important. We performed a quality assessment of five commonly used antihypertensive generic drugs in 10 sub-Saharan African countries and studied the impact of price on quality.

- **Methods**: Drug samples were prospectively collected using standardized methods between 2012 and 2014. We developed a validated reversed-phase liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry method to accurately quantify the active ingredient in a certified public laboratory. Quality was defined based on the percentage ratio of measured to expected dosage of the active ingredient.

- **Results**: A total of 1185 samples were assessed, of which 70.0% were generic (n = 830). Among the generic drugs, the percentage of poor-quality drugs was 24.3% (n = 202/830). The percentage ratio of measured to expected dosage of the active ingredient ranged from 49.2 to 111.3%; the majority (81.7%) of the poor-quality samples had insufficient quantities of the active ingredient. Moreover, poor quality was not associated with the purchase price of the drug.

- **Conclusion**: In this study from 10 sub-Saharan African countries, nearly one-quarter of the available generic antihypertensive drugs were found to be of poor quality. Concerted measures to improve the quality of antihypertensive drugs could lead to major improvements.

### Medical measures in hypertensives considered resistant [^112VJDru]. American Journal of Hypertension (2024). Low credibility.

According to the American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) 2017, International Society of Hypertension (ISH) 2020, and European Society of Hypertension (ESH) 2023 Guidelines, the preferred antihypertensive drug treatment for resistant hypertension should at least include the following antihypertensive classes: angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker, calcium antagonist (calcium channel blocker), and thiazide diuretics. The steps recommended to apply if triple therapy (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker, calcium channel blocker, and diuretic) fails to achieve optimal blood pressure (BP) are the following:

- **Optimize and tailor the treatment regimen**: Based on individual risk factors, including health behavior changes.
- **Use of thiazide-like rather than thiazide diuretics**: Initiation of loop diuretics for estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 45 ml/min/1.73m² to achieve BP targets.
- **If spironolactone is contraindicated**: Consider alternate strategies as appropriate.

Abbreviations: ACEi, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor; ARB, angiotensin receptor blocker; BP, blood pressure; CCB, calcium channel blocker; eGFR, estimated glomerular filtration rate; HT, hypertension; T/TL, thiazide/thiazide-like.

### Is the extrapolated adult dose of fosinopril safe and effective in treating hypertensive children [^1113TU3S]. Hypertension (2004). High credibility.

We evaluated the efficacy, safety, and dose-response relationship of fosinopril in children aged 6 to 16 years with hypertension or high-normal blood pressure with an associated medical condition requiring treatment. The study was a prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted in 78 clinical sites in the United States, Russia, and Israel. There were four phases: a screening phase of 10 days maximum, a 4-week dose-response phase, a placebo withdrawal phase of 2 weeks maximum, and a 52-week open-label safety phase.

The primary objective of the dose-response phase was to determine whether low (0.1 mg/kg), medium (0.3 mg/kg), or high (0.6 mg/kg) doses of fosinopril, based on established adult dosing, affect trough seated systolic blood pressure. During the dose-response phase, all three doses were equally effective in lowering systolic blood pressure.

During the placebo withdrawal phase, there was an adjusted mean systolic blood pressure increase of 5.2 mm Hg for the placebo group and 1.5 mm Hg for the fosinopril group, resulting in a net withdrawal effect of 3.7 mm Hg (P = 0.013). Fosinopril was well tolerated; serious adverse events occurred infrequently and were generally not attributed to fosinopril. Because children appear to be more sensitive to lower doses of fosinopril than adults, starting doses for children should be ≤ 0.1 mg/kg.

### Xadago [^112kgm7r]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

XADAGO may cause hypertension or exacerbate existing hypertension. In clinical trials, the incidence of hypertension was 7% for XADAGO 50 mg, 5% for XADAGO 100 mg, and 4% for placebo. Monitor patients for new-onset hypertension or hypertension that is not adequately controlled after starting XADAGO, as medication adjustment may be necessary if elevation of blood pressure is sustained.

Monitor for hypertension if XADAGO is prescribed concomitantly with sympathomimetic medications, including prescription or nonprescription nasal, oral, and ophthalmic decongestants and cold remedies [see Drug Interactions (7.5)].

XADAGO is a selective inhibitor of MAO-B at the recommended dosages of 50 mg or 100 mg daily. Selectivity for inhibiting MAO-B decreases above the recommended daily dosages [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. Therefore, XADAGO should not be used at daily dosages exceeding those recommended because of the risks of hypertension, exacerbation of existing hypertension, or hypertensive crisis.

Dietary tyramine restriction is not required during treatment with recommended doses of XADAGO. However, use with certain foods that contain very high amounts (i.e. more than 150 mg) of tyramine could cause severe hypertension, resulting from an increased sensitivity to tyramine in patients taking recommended dosages of XADAGO, and patients should be advised to avoid such foods.

Isoniazid has some monoamine oxidase inhibiting activity. Monitor for hypertension and reaction to dietary tyramine in patients treated concomitantly with isoniazid and XADAGO.

### Randomized dose-response study of the new dual endothelin receptor antagonist aprocitentan in hypertension [^1118vxvt]. Hypertension (2020). High credibility.

The ambulatory BP monitoring analyses were based on a subset of the per-protocol set with a valid ambulatory BP measurement (ABPM) at baseline and at week 8 (n = 281). Compared to placebo, aprocitentan doses of 10, 25, and 50 mg lowered mean 24-hour systolic BP/diastolic BP (SBP/DBP) from baseline by 3.99/4.04, 4.83/5.89, and 3.67/4.45 mm Hg, respectively. Similar trends were observed for daytime and nighttime mean SBP/DBP.

- **Safety and tolerability**: Aprocitentan was generally well tolerated; the incidence of adverse events (AEs), ranging from 22.0% to 40.2% in the various dose groups, was similar to that reported for placebo (36.6%). Overall, the most common events were hypertension, headache, and nasopharyngitis. None of the three serious AEs were considered to be related to treatment. Numerically fewer patients reported AEs leading to discontinuation in the aprocitentan groups (1.2%–3.7%) than in the placebo group (6.1%) [P = 0.14], with 3.7% in the lisinopril group [P = 0.65].

	- Mild-to-moderate peripheral edema was reported in four patients (two in each of the 25 mg and 50 mg groups) and led to permanent discontinuation from treatment in two patients (in the 50 mg group). One of these two patients had a history of ankle edema. Among the four patients with edema, three had a weight change of 0.0 to 1.1 kg and hemoglobin reductions of 0.5 to 1.4 g/dL, suggesting minimal fluid retention and hemodilution, and possible fluid redistribution.

### First-line combination therapy versus first-line monotherapy for primary hypertension [^113i4TjW]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Starting with one drug and starting with a combination of two drugs are strategies suggested in clinical guidelines as initial treatment of hypertension. These recommendations are not based on evidence about clinically relevant outcomes. Some antihypertensive combinations have been shown to be harmful, and the actual harm-to-benefit balance of each strategy is unknown.

- **Objectives**: To determine if there are differences in clinical outcomes between monotherapy and combination therapy as initial treatment for primary hypertension.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Hypertension Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, 2016, Issue 2), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, LILACS, ClinicalTrials.gov, Controlled Trials, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) up to February 2016. We also searched in clinical studies repositories of pharmaceutical companies, reviews of combination drugs in the Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency, and lists of references in reviews and clinical practice guidelines.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized, double-blind trials with at least 12 months' follow-up in adults with primary hypertension (systolic blood pressure/diastolic blood pressure 140/90 mmHg or higher, or 130/80 mmHg or higher if participants had diabetes), which compared a combination of two first-line antihypertensive drugs with monotherapy as initial treatment. Trials had to include at least 50 participants per group and report mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and cardiovascular outcomes.

### Hypotension following the initiation of tizanidine in a patient treated with an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor for chronic hypertension [^112NYAzW]. Journal of Child Neurology (2000). Low credibility.

Centrally acting alpha-2 adrenergic agonists are one of several pharmacologic agents used in the treatment of spasticity related to disorders of the central nervous system. In addition to their effects on spasticity, certain adverse cardiorespiratory effects have been reported. Adults chronically treated with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors may have limited ability to respond to hypotension when the sympathetic response is simultaneously blocked. The authors present a 10-year-old boy chronically treated with lisinopril, an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, to control hypertension who developed hypotension following the addition of tizanidine, an alpha-2 agonist, for the treatment of spasticity. The possible interaction of tizanidine and other antihypertensive agents should be kept in mind when prescribing therapy to treat either hypertension or spasticity in such patients.

### Blood pressure lowering efficacy of partial agonist beta blocker monotherapy for primary hypertension [^1175vHQ9]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Partial agonists are a subclass of beta blockers used to treat hypertension in many countries. They act by stimulating beta receptors when they are quiescent and blocking them when they are active. The blood pressure (BP) lowering effect of partial agonist beta blockers has not been quantified.

- **Objectives**: To quantify the dose-related effects of various partial agonist beta blockers on systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and heart rate versus placebo in patients with primary hypertension.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Hypertension Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process, EMBASE, and ClinicalTrials.gov for randomized controlled trials up to October 2014. The WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) is searched for inclusion in the Group's Specialised Register.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized double-blinded placebo-controlled parallel or cross-over trials were included. Studies must contain a partial agonist monotherapy arm with a fixed dose. Patients enrolled in the studies must have primary hypertension at baseline (defined as SBP/DBP > 140/90 mmHg). The duration of the studies must be between three to 12 weeks.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two authors (GW and HB) confirmed the inclusion of studies and extracted the data independently.

- **Main results**: Thirteen randomized double-blinded placebo-controlled trials examining the blood pressure lowering efficacy of six partial agonists in 605 hypertensive patients were included in this review.

### First-line drugs for hypertension [^115FQHjS]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

This is the first update of a review published in 2009. Sustained moderate to severe elevations in resting blood pressure lead to a critically important clinical question: What class of drug to use first-line? This review attempted to answer that question.

- **Objectives**: To quantify the mortality and morbidity effects from different first-line antihypertensive drug classes: thiazides (low-dose and high-dose), beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), and alpha-blockers, compared to placebo or no treatment. Secondary objectives include quantifying the blood pressure lowering effect and the rate of withdrawal due to adverse drug effects when different antihypertensive drug classes are used as the first-line drug, compared to placebo or no treatment.

- **Search methods**: The Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomized controlled trials up to November 2017: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials.gov. Authors of relevant papers were contacted regarding further published and unpublished work.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized trials (RCTs) of at least one year duration, comparing one of six major drug classes with a placebo or no treatment, in adult patients with blood pressure over 140/90 mmHg at baseline. The majority (over 70%) of the patients in the treatment group were ta.

### Zanaflex [^116Ey4aC]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Zanaflex® (tizanidine hydrochloride) is a central alpha2-adrenergic agonist. Tizanidine HCl is a white to off-white, fine crystalline powder, which is odorless or has a faint characteristic odor. It is slightly soluble in water and methanol, with solubility in water decreasing as the pH increases. The chemical name of tizanidine is 5-chloro-4-(2-imidazolin-2-ylamino)-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole monohydrochloride. The molecular formula is C9H8ClN5S-HCl, and its molecular weight is 290.2.

Zanaflex Capsules® are supplied as 2, 4, and 6 mg capsules for oral administration. They contain the active ingredient, tizanidine hydrochloride, with 2.29 mg equivalent to 2 mg tizanidine base, 4.58 mg equivalent to 4 mg tizanidine base, and 6.87 mg equivalent to 6 mg tizanidine base. The inactive ingredients in the capsules include hypromellose, silicon dioxide, sugar spheres, titanium dioxide, gelatin, and colorants.

Zanaflex® tablets are provided as 4 mg tablets for oral administration. These tablets contain the active ingredient, tizanidine hydrochloride, with 4.58 mg equivalent to 4 mg tizanidine base. The inactive ingredients in the tablets are colloidal silicon dioxide, stearic acid, microcrystalline cellulose, and anhydrous lactose.

### Zestril [^114rpH7p]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Zestril is indicated for the treatment of hypertension in adult patients and pediatric patients 6 years of age and older to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been demonstrated in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes.

Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than one drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program's Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC).

Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. It can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for these benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality have also been seen regularly.

### Zanaflex [^11716zVH]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Impaired renal function**: Zanaflex is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. In patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min), clearance was reduced by more than 50%. In these patients, individual doses should be reduced during titration. If higher doses are required, individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased. These patients should be monitored closely for the onset or increase in severity of Zanaflex's common adverse events, such as dry mouth, somnolence, asthenia, and dizziness, as indicators of potential overdosage [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Warnings and Precautions (5.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

- **Impaired hepatic function**: The influence of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine has not been evaluated. Because tizanidine is extensively metabolized in the liver, hepatic impairment would be expected to have significant effects on the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine [see Dosing and Administration (2.3), Warnings and Precautions (5.2), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Randomized dose-response study of the new dual endothelin receptor antagonist aprocitentan in hypertension [^116PXqos]. Hypertension (2020). High credibility.

- **Results**:

	**Patients**: Of 1659 initially screened patients, 996 were enrolled in the placebo-run-in period, and 490 were randomized (see Figure 1). The most common reason for exclusion before randomization was failure to meet the SiDBP inclusion criterion. A total of 430 patients completed the 8-week treatment period. Patients were discontinued due to development of grade 3 hypertension, defined as SiSBP ≥ 180 or SiDBP ≥ 110 mm Hg (2.4%–3.7% in the aprocitentan groups, 3.7% for placebo, 1.2% for lisinopril), adverse events (0%–2.4% aprocitentan, 3.7% placebo, 1.2% lisinopril), or loss to follow-up (1.2%–4.9% aprocitentan, 2.4% placebo, 2.5% lisinopril).

	**Demographic and baseline characteristics**: Demographic and baseline characteristics were similar across the 6 treatment groups (see Table 1 for all randomized set, Table S2 for the per-protocol set). The randomized study population was predominantly male (61%), with a mean age of 55 years. The median duration of essential hypertension was 6.8 years. The mean baseline uAOBP (SiSBP/SiDBP) was 149.8/97.8 mm Hg, and the mean baseline 24-hour BP was 141.6/91.1 mm Hg. Kidney function was normal at baseline (Table 1, Table S2).

	**uAOBP measurement**: The uAOBP analyses were based on the per-protocol set (n = 409). A clinically relevant decrease in trough BP occurred within 2 weeks in the aprocitentan 10, 25, and 50 mg groups and was maintained up to week 8 (see Figure 2 A and 2 B, Table 2). BP returned to placebo levels during the withdrawal period.

### Zanaflex [^112srRjc]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

**Drug discontinuation**: If therapy needs to be discontinued, particularly in patients who have been receiving high doses (20 mg to 36 mg daily) for long periods (9 weeks or more) or who may be on concomitant treatment with narcotics, the dose should be decreased slowly (2 mg to 4 mg per day) to minimize the risk of withdrawal and rebound hypertension, tachycardia, and hypertonia [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3)].

### Drug therapy for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction: What is the 'right' dose [^113C3CKD]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2022). Low credibility.

It is important to consider the actual dose in the treatment arms in the two larger trials. In ATLAS, these were 4.5 mg versus 33.2 mg of lisinopril, and in HEAAL, 46 mg versus 129 mg of losartan. Here, ATLAS is perhaps most striking in suggesting that even a small dose (one-seventh of the higher dose) preserves much of the benefit of a larger dose of an ACE inhibitor. However, we still have the problem of knowing what dose of enalapril or candesartan 4.5 mg of lisinopril is equivalent to. There are no satisfactory comparisons of doses of lisinopril and enalapril, or doses of lisinopril and candesartan, in people with heart failure. However, the data that do exist, and comparisons in hypertension, suggest the low dose of lisinopril used in ATLAS was probably equivalent to less than 10 mg of enalapril. Of interest, in both HEAAL and ATLAS, the proportion of patients who discontinued study drugs did not differ between the high and low-dose groups. In both trials, hypotension, renal dysfunction, and hyperkalemia occurred more frequently in the higher dose group, but there was no significant excess of discontinuation for any of these reasons in the higher dose group in either trial.

Although three trials comparing doses of beta-blockers showed a greater increase in left ventricular ejection fraction with larger doses, each was small and reported too few deaths and hospital admissions (or reported these incompletely) to draw any meaningful conclusion about a dose-related effect on outcomes. Two of these trials compared carvedilol over a wide daily dose range (5 to 50 mg).

### Beta-blockers for hypertension [^116eUGmN]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). High credibility.

Hypertension is one of the leading causes of disability and premature deaths worldwide. The rationale for treating hypertension gained significant momentum with findings indicating that even small reductions in blood pressure can substantially reduce associated morbidity and mortality risks. The major classes of drugs for treating hypertension include beta-blockers, calcium-channel blockers (CCBs), diuretics, and renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors.

Beta-blockers refer to a diverse group of drugs that block the action of endogenous catecholamines on beta-adrenergic receptors, which are part of the autonomic (sympathetic) nervous system. The autonomic nervous system's role in blood pressure control has been recognized since 1949. The principal adrenergic receptors in the human cardiovascular system are β1, β2, and α1 receptors.

- **Classification of beta-blockers**: Beta-blockers vary in their β1/β2-adrenergic receptor selectivity and vasodilatory properties, leading to their classification into first, second, and third generations.
	- First-generation beta-blockers: These have equal affinity for β1 and β2 receptors and are classified as non-selective beta-blockers (e.g. propranolol).
	- Second-generation beta-blockers: These are more selective for β1 than β2 receptors and are thus termed selective beta-blockers (e.g. atenolol).
	- Third-generation beta-blockers: These are known for their [further detail needed to complete this description].

### Olanzapine [^111Sw9LV]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Olanzapine has the potential to affect other drugs in various ways.

- **CNS acting drugs**: Given the primary CNS effects of olanzapine, caution should be used when olanzapine is taken in combination with other centrally acting drugs and alcohol.

- **Antihypertensive agents**: Olanzapine, because of its potential for inducing hypotension, may enhance the effects of certain antihypertensive agents.

- **Levodopa and dopamine agonists**: Olanzapine may antagonize the effects of levodopa and dopamine agonists.

- **Lithium**: Multiple doses of olanzapine (10 mg for 8 days) did not influence the kinetics of lithium; therefore, concomitant olanzapine administration does not require dosage adjustment of lithium [see Warnings and Precautions (5.16)].

- **Valproate**: Olanzapine (10 mg daily for 2 weeks) did not affect the steady state plasma concentrations of valproate. Therefore, concomitant olanzapine administration does not require dosage adjustment of valproate [see Warnings and Precautions (5.16)].

- **Effect on drug metabolizing enzymes**: In vitro studies utilizing human liver microsomes suggest that olanzapine has little potential to inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A. Thus, olanzapine is unlikely to cause clinically important drug interactions mediated by these enzymes.

- **Imipramine**: Single doses of olanzapine did not affect the pharmacokinetics of imipramine or its active metabolite desipramine.

- **Warfarin**: Single doses of olanzapine did not affect the pharmacokinetics of warfarin [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

- **Diazepam**: Olanzapine did not influence the pharmacokinetics of diazepam.

### Toprol-XL [^116ABrwx]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Pediatric use**: One hundred forty-four hypertensive pediatric patients aged 6 to 16 years were randomized to placebo or to one of three dose levels of Toprol-XL (0.2, 1, or 2 mg/kg once daily) and followed for 4 weeks. The study did not meet its primary endpoint (dose response for reduction in SBP). Some pre-specified secondary endpoints demonstrated effectiveness, including dose-response for reduction in DBP, 1 mg/kg vs. placebo for change in SBP, and 2 mg/kg vs. placebo for change in SBP and DBP. The mean placebo-corrected reductions in SBP ranged from 3 to 6 mmHg, and DBP from 1 to 5 mmHg. The mean reduction in heart rate ranged from 5 to 7 bpm, but considerably greater reductions were seen in some individuals. No clinically relevant differences in the adverse event profile were observed for pediatric patients aged 6 to 16 years as compared with adult patients. Safety and effectiveness of Toprol-XL have not been established in patients under 6 years of age.

- **Geriatric use**: Clinical studies of Toprol-XL in hypertension did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience in hypertensive patients has not identified differences in responses between elderly and younger patients. Of the 1,990 patients with heart failure randomized to Toprol-XL in the MERIT-HF trial, 50% (990) were 65 years of age and older, and 12% (238) were 75 years of age and older. There were no notable differences in efficacy or the rate of adverse reactions.

### Combination therapy with oral treprostinil for pulmonary arterial hypertension. A double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial [^117XJV3k]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

A total of 334 (96.5%) participants in the oral treprostinil group and 219 (63.7%) participants in the placebo group reported at least one adverse event attributable to the study drug. Headache, diarrhea, flushing, nausea, and vomiting were more commonly attributed to oral treprostinil and were more often severe compared with events attributed to placebo. Study drug discontinuation because of adverse events was substantially more common in oral treprostinil–assigned participants (18.8%) than in placebo participants (4.1%). Discontinuation due to an adverse event was more common before Week 24 and occurred at a median (interquartile range) oral treprostinil dose of 1.4 (0.4–3.0) mg three times daily.

### Blood pressure lowering efficacy of beta-1 selective beta blockers for primary hypertension [^112Y12zp]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Beta blockers are commonly used to treat hypertension, with blood pressure readings serving as the primary tool for physicians and patients to assess treatment efficacy. However, the blood pressure-lowering effect of beta-1 selective blockers remains uncertain.

- **Objectives**: To quantify the dose-related effects of various doses and types of beta-1 selective adrenergic receptor blockers on systolic and diastolic blood pressure versus placebo in individuals with primary hypertension.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness (DARE) for related reviews. Additionally, we searched the following databases for primary studies: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register (all years to 15 October 2015), CENTRAL via the Cochrane Register of Studies Online (2015, Issue 10), Ovid MEDLINE (1946 to 15 October 2015), and Ovid EMBASE (1974 to 15 October 2015).

### Zestoretic [^114qHuXU]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

Lisinopril monotherapy is an effective treatment for hypertension in once-daily doses of 10 mg to 80 mg, while hydrochlorothiazide monotherapy is effective in doses of 12.5 mg per day to 50 mg per day. In clinical trials of lisinopril/hydrochlorothiazide combination therapy using lisinopril doses of 10 mg to 80 mg and hydrochlorothiazide doses of 6.25 mg to 50 mg, the antihypertensive response rates generally increased with increasing doses of either component.

The side effects (see warnings) of lisinopril are generally rare and apparently independent of dose; those of hydrochlorothiazide consist of both dose-dependent phenomena (primarily hypokalemia) and dose-independent phenomena (e.g. pancreatitis), the former being much more common. Therapy with any combination of lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide may be associated with either or both dose-independent or dose-dependent side effects, but the addition of lisinopril in clinical trials blunted the hypokalemia normally seen with diuretics.

To minimize dose-dependent side effects, it is usually appropriate to begin combination therapy only following a patient has failed to achieve the desired effect with monotherapy.

- **Dose titration guided by clinical effect**: A patient whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled with either lisinopril or hydrochlorothiazide monotherapy may be switched to lisinopril/HCTZ 10/12.5 or lisinopril/HCTZ 20/12.5, depending on the monotherapy dose. Further increases in either or both components should depend on clinical response, with blood pressure measured accordingly.

### Resistant hypertension [^1147zhWP]. Journal of Hypertension (2005). Low credibility.

Hypertension that remains above 140/90 mmHg despite the use of three antihypertensive drugs in a rational combination at full doses, including a diuretic, is known as 'resistant' hypertension. The percentage of hypertensive patients whose condition is resistant varies significantly depending on the setting. In general practice, the prevalence is approximately 5%, whereas among patients seen by nephrologists, it is likely around 50%.

This paper reviews the major causes of resistant hypertension and provides specific recommendations for the evaluation and management of patients with this challenging condition.

### Zanaflex [^1157UwiA]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Specific populations**: The investigation into age effects revealed no specific pharmacokinetic studies were conducted. A cross-study comparison of pharmacokinetic data following a single dose administration of 6 mg Zanaflex showed that younger subjects cleared the drug four times faster than elderly subjects. Notably, Zanaflex has not been evaluated in children.

- **Hepatic impairment**: The influence of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine has not been evaluated. Given that tizanidine is extensively metabolized in the liver, hepatic impairment is expected to significantly affect its pharmacokinetics. Consequently, Zanaflex is not recommended for patients with hepatic impairment.

- **Renal impairment**: Tizanidine clearance is reduced by more than 50% in elderly patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min) compared to healthy elderly subjects; this reduction is expected to result in a longer duration of clinical effect. Therefore, Zanaflex should be used with caution in patients with renal impairment.

- **Gender effects**: No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate gender effects. However, retrospective analysis of pharmacokinetic data following single and multiple dose administration of 4 mg Zanaflex indicated that gender had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine.

### Time course for blood pressure lowering of beta-blockers with partial agonist activity [^1118JqUw]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Low credibility.

Beta-blockers are commonly used in the treatment of hypertension. However, it is unclear if the blood pressure (BP) lowering efficacy of beta-blockers varies throughout the day. This review focuses on the subclass of beta-blockers with partial agonist activity (BBPAA).

- **Objectives**: To assess the degree of variation in hourly BP lowering efficacy of BBPAA over a 24-hour period in adults with essential hypertension.

- **Search methods**: The Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist searched the following databases for relevant studies up to June 2020: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register; CENTRAL; 2020, Issue 5; MEDLINE Ovid; Embase Ovid; the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform; and ClinicalTrials.gov. Authors of relevant papers were also contacted regarding further published and unpublished work. The searches had no language restrictions.

- **Selection criteria**: Both randomised and non-randomised trials that assessed the hourly effect of BBPAA by ambulatory monitoring, with a minimum follow-up of three weeks, were considered for inclusion.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently selected the included trials and extracted the data. The certainty of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach. Outcomes included in the review were end-point hourly systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP) and heart rate (HR), measured using a 24-hour ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) device.

- **Main results**: Fourteen non-randomised baseline controlled trials of BBPAA met the inclusion criteria, but only seven studies were adequately analyzed.

### Combination therapy in hypertension: An update [^116MU46H]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2010). Low credibility.

Combination therapy in hypertension utilizes multiple mechanisms to achieve target blood pressure levels. It is often considered more effective than monotherapy, especially in patients with resistant hypertension or comorbid conditions. This approach typically involves using medications with complementary mechanisms of action, enhancing efficacy while minimizing side effects.

- **Rationale for combination therapy**: Patients with severe hypertension or those who do not respond to a single drug often benefit from combination therapy. By targeting different physiological pathways, such therapy can effectively lower blood pressure.

- **Types of antihypertensive drugs used**: Common classes of medications include ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), calcium channel blockers, and diuretics. Each has a unique mechanism, and their combinations can be tailored to patient needs.

- **Potential benefits and drawbacks**: Benefits include improved cardiovascular outcomes and reduced risk of organ damage. However, careful management is needed to avoid adverse effects such as electrolyte imbalances.

- **Clinical guidelines and recommendations**: Current guidelines suggest initiating combination therapy in cases of stage 2 hypertension or when monotherapy fails to achieve desired blood pressure control.

This article provides an updated overview of combination therapy strategies and considerations for clinicians managing patients with hypertension.

### Medication adherence-still the holy grail [^113eFzR6]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Low credibility.

Despite the plethora of evidence suggesting that fixed-dose combination products improve medication adherence and satisfaction, they are rarely used in the United States. Why do practitioners not opt to prescribe fixed-dose combination antihypertensive products? We have often heard from practitioners that an important barrier is the lack of options, both in drug and dose selection. Although there is a seemingly large number of combinations currently marketed in the United States, a single diuretic (hydrochlorothiazide) is present in some three-quarters of products. Others include seldom-used drugs (e.g. timolol, spironolactone, aliskiren) or combinations (e.g. hydrochlorothiazide + amiloride, chlorthalidone + clonidine).

Furthermore, dosing options are often limited to combinations of low, moderate, or high doses, but no other permutations. For example, it is not currently possible to use a fixed-dose combination for 50 mg hydrochlorothiazide/day + a low-dose of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or ARB. We would argue that low-dose combinations are likely sufficient and nearly as effective as higher dose combinations for most patients; however, practitioners may have legitimate reasons for wanting to maximize a single antihypertensive among a multidrug regimen. The array of combination products is largely a byproduct of the antihypertensive drug development pipeline, with new products added as new classes emerged (e.g. hydrochlorothiazide + angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or ARBs). Regrettably, most generic manufacturers do.

### Optimal systolic blood pressure target, time to intensification, and time to follow-up in treatment of hypertension: Population based retrospective cohort study [^1158rLsq]. BMJ (2015). Low credibility.

Patients' baseline characteristics and pre-existing medical conditions were assessed during the run-in period. The run-in period began on the clinic registration date and ended on the later date of 12 months after clinic registration, or the first documentation of a hypertension-related diagnosis code or systolic blood pressure of 130 mm Hg or above.

We defined a treatment strategy assessment period for each patient, which consisted of the first 10 years after the end of the run-in period. During this period, we defined the minimum intensification threshold as the lowest systolic blood pressure at which antihypertensive medication intensification occurred, out of all known intensification events, rounded down to the nearest 10 mm Hg. For instance, for a patient who had antihypertensive medication additions or dose increases at blood pressures of 167, 145, and 155 mm Hg, we would assume that the physician was targeting a blood pressure goal of 140 mm Hg. This approach allowed us to represent the patient's treatment as a single summary, as is the standard approach in cohort studies.

We defined antihypertensive medication intensifications as the start of a new antihypertensive medication (complete list in supplementary table B) or an increase in the daily dose of an existing medication, on a date on which blood pressure was measured. Medication adjustments made when systolic blood pressure was already lower than 130 mm Hg are unlikely to represent antihypertensive medication intensifications, so we excluded them.

### Medical measures in hypertensives considered resistant [^116K5ubc]. American Journal of Hypertension (2024). Low credibility.

Patients with resistant hypertension are the group of hypertensive patients with the highest cardiovascular risk.

- **Methods**: All rules and guidelines for the treatment of hypertension should be strictly followed to obtain blood pressure (BP) control in resistant hypertension. The mainstay of hypertension treatment, including for resistant hypertension, is pharmacological intervention tailored to each patient's specific phenotype. Therefore, it is crucial to assess nonadherence to pharmacological treatment, as this remains the most challenging problem to investigate and manage in the setting of resistant hypertension.

- **Results**: Once adherence has been confirmed, patients must be thoroughly worked-up for secondary causes of hypertension. Until such possible specific causes have been clarified, the diagnosis is apparent treatment-resistant hypertension (TRH). Surprisingly, few patients remain with true TRH when the various secondary causes and adherence problems have been detected and resolved. Refractory hypertension is characterized by treatment resistance in hypertensive patients using ≥ 5 antihypertensive drugs. All pressor mechanisms may then need blockage before their BPs are reasonably controlled.

- **Conclusions**: Patients with resistant hypertension require careful and sustained follow-up, as well as a review of their medications and dosages at each term since medication adherence is a very dynamic process.

### Blood pressure lowering efficacy of renin inhibitors for primary hypertension [^116RrMfd]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). High credibility.

Hypertension is a chronic condition associated with an increased risk of mortality and morbidity. Renin is the enzyme responsible for converting angiotensinogen to angiotensin I, which is then converted to angiotensin II. Renin inhibitors are a new class of drugs designed to decrease blood pressure (BP) by preventing the formation of both angiotensin I and angiotensin II.

- **Objectives**: To quantify the dose-related BP lowering efficacy of renin inhibitors compared to placebo in the treatment of primary hypertension. To determine the change in BP variability, pulse pressure, and heart rate, and to evaluate adverse events such as mortality, non-fatal serious adverse events, total adverse events, withdrawal due to adverse effects, and specific adverse events like dry cough, diarrhoea, and angioedema.

- **Search methods**: The Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) up to February 2017: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialized Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2017, Issue 2), MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials.gov. There was no restriction by language or publication status. We also searched the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for clinical study reports, the Novartis Clinical Study Results Database, and bibliographic citations from retrieved references and contacted authors of relevant papers regarding further published and unpublished work.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that provided relevant data.

### Zestril [^112K2r9p]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Pharmacodynamics**:

- **Hypertension**: Administration of Zestril to patients with hypertension results in a reduction of both supine and standing blood pressure to about the same extent, with no compensatory tachycardia. Symptomatic postural hypotension is usually not observed, although it can occur and should be anticipated in volume and/or salt-depleted patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. When given together with thiazide-type diuretics, the blood pressure-lowering effects of the two drugs are approximately additive.

	- In most patients studied, the onset of antihypertensive activity was seen at one hour after oral administration of an individual dose of Zestril, with peak reduction of blood pressure achieved by 6 hours. Although an antihypertensive effect was observed 24 hours after dosing with the recommended single daily doses, the effect was more consistent and the mean effect was considerably larger in some studies with doses of 20 mg or more than with lower doses. However, at all doses studied, the mean antihypertensive effect was substantially smaller 24 hours after dosing than it was 6 hours after dosing.

	- The antihypertensive effects of Zestril are maintained during long-term therapy. Abrupt withdrawal of Zestril has not been associated with a rapid increase in blood pressure or a significant increase in blood pressure compared to pretreatment levels.

### Zestril [^113UkTRh]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Hypertension**: Two dose-response studies utilizing a once-daily regimen were conducted in 438 mild to moderate hypertensive patients not on a diuretic. Blood pressure was measured 24 hours after dosing. An antihypertensive effect of Zestril was seen with 5 mg of Zestril in some patients. However, in both studies, blood pressure reduction occurred sooner and was greater in patients treated with 10 mg, 20 mg, or 80 mg of Zestril than in patients treated with 5 mg of Zestril.

In controlled clinical studies of patients with mild to moderate hypertension, patients were treated with Zestril 20 mg to 80 mg daily, hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg to 50 mg daily, or atenolol 50 mg to 200 mg daily. In other studies of patients with moderate to severe hypertension, patients were treated with Zestril 20 mg to 80 mg daily or metoprolol 100 mg to 200 mg daily. Zestril demonstrated superior reductions of systolic and diastolic blood pressure compared to hydrochlorothiazide in a population that was 75% Caucasian. Zestril was approximately equivalent to atenolol and metoprolol in reducing diastolic blood pressure and had somewhat greater effects on systolic blood pressure.

Zestril had similar blood pressure reductions and adverse effects in younger and older (> 65 years) patients. It was less effective in reducing blood pressure in Blacks than in Caucasians.

### Clonidine hydrochloride [^115rX8JJ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Rebound hypertension**: Abrupt discontinuation of clonidine hydrochloride extended-release tablets can cause rebound hypertension. In adults with hypertension, sudden cessation of clonidine hydrochloride extended-release formulation treatment in the 0.2 to 0.6 mg/day range resulted in reports of headache, tachycardia, nausea, flushing, warm feeling, brief lightheadedness, tightness in chest, and anxiety. In adults with hypertension, sudden cessation of treatment with immediate-release clonidine has, in some cases, resulted in symptoms such as nervousness, agitation, headache, and tremor accompanied or followed by a rapid rise in blood pressure and elevated catecholamine concentrations in the plasma.

	- No studies evaluating abrupt discontinuation of clonidine hydrochloride extended-release tablets in children with ADHD have been conducted. However, to minimize the risk of rebound hypertension, gradually reduce the dose of clonidine hydrochloride extended-release tablets in decrements of no more than 0.1 mg every 3 to 7 days. Patients should be instructed not to discontinue clonidine hydrochloride extended-release tablets therapy without consulting their physician due to the potential risk of withdrawal effects.

- **Allergic reactions**: In patients who have developed localized contact sensitization to the clonidine transdermal system, continuation of the clonidine transdermal system or substitution of oral clonidine hydrochloride extended-release tablets therapy may be associated with the development of a generalized skin rash.

### Zelapar [^1122apaS]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

Hypertension and non-selective inhibition of MAO above the recommended dose: Advise patients or their caregivers not to exceed the daily recommended dose of 2.5 mg. Explain the risk of using higher daily doses of Zelapar and provide a brief description of the hypertensive tyramine reaction. Rare hypertensive reactions with oral selegiline at recommended doses associated with dietary influences have been reported.

Inform patients or their caregivers about the potential for MAOI-induced hypertensive reactions and describe their signs and symptoms. Instruct patients to report immediately if they experience a severe headache, other atypical or unusual symptoms not previously experienced, or very high blood pressure.

The possibility exists that very tyramine-rich foods (e.g. aged cheese such as Stilton) could cause an increase in blood pressure. Patients should be advised to avoid certain foods containing a very large amount of tyramine while taking recommended doses of Zelapar because of the potential for large increases in blood pressure. If patients eat foods very rich in tyramine and do not feel well soon after eating, they should contact their healthcare provider [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

- **Serotonin syndrome**: Inform patients if they are taking, or planning to take, any prescription or over-the-counter drugs, especially antidepressants and over-the-counter cold medications, because there is a potential for interaction with Zelapar. Patients should not use meperidine or certain other analgesics.

### Blood pressure-lowering efficacy of reserpine for primary hypertension [^113gthaK]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). High credibility.

Many antihypertensive agents exist today for the treatment of primary hypertension (systolic blood pressure ≥ 140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 90 mmHg, or both). Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have been conducted to investigate the evidence for these agents. Notably, there is strong RCT evidence that thiazides reduce mortality and morbidity, with some trials utilizing reserpine as a second-line therapy. However, the dose-related blood pressure reduction with this agent remains unknown.

- **Objectives**: The primary objective of this review was to quantify the dose-related efficacy of reserpine versus placebo or no treatment in reducing systolic blood pressure (SBP) or diastolic blood pressure (DBP), or both. Additionally, we aimed to evaluate the dose-related effects of reserpine on mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR), as well as the dose-related effects on withdrawals due to adverse events.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Hypertension Group Specialised Register (January 1946 to October 2016), CENTRAL (2016, Issue 10), MEDLINE (January 1946 to October 2016), Embase (January 1974 to October 2016), and ClinicalTrials.gov (all dates to October 2016). We also traced citations in the reference sections of the retrieved studies.

- **Selection criteria**: Included studies were truly randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing reserpine monotherapy to placebo or no treatment in participants with primary hypertension.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We assessed methods of randomisation and concealment and extracted and analysed data on blood pressure.

### Zejula [^117HZebQ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Hypertension and cardiovascular effects**: Hypertension and hypertensive crisis have been reported in patients treated with Zejula [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. In the PRIMA study, Grade 3 to 4 hypertension occurred in 6% of patients treated with Zejula compared with 1% of placebo-treated patients, with a median time from first dose to first onset of 43 days (range: 1 to 531 days) and with a median duration of 12 days (range: 1 to 61 days). There were no discontinuations due to hypertension. In the NOVA study, Grade 3 to 4 hypertension occurred in 9% of patients treated with Zejula compared with 2% of placebo-treated patients, with a median time from first dose to first onset of 77 days (range: 4 to 504 days) and with a median duration of 15 days (range: 1 to 86 days). Discontinuation due to hypertension occurred in less than 1% of patients. Monitor blood pressure and heart rate at least weekly for the first 2 months, then monthly for the first year, and periodically thereafter during treatment with Zejula. Closely monitor patients with cardiovascular disorders, especially coronary insufficiency, cardiac arrhythmias, and hypertension. Medically manage hypertension with antihypertensive medications and adjustment of the dose of Zejula if necessary [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Nonclinical Toxicology (13.2)].

- **Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome**: Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) occurred in 0.1% of 2,165 patients treated with Zejula in clinical trials and has also been described in postmarketing reports [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Signs and symptoms of PRES include…

### First-line drugs for hypertension [^1174mEMA]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Sustained elevated blood pressure, unresponsive to lifestyle measures, leads to a critically important clinical question: What class of drug to use first-line? This review answers that question.

- **Primary objective**: To quantify the benefits and harms of the major first-line anti-hypertensive drug classes: thiazides, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, alpha-blockers, and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB).

- **Search strategy**: An electronic search of MEDLINE (Jan. 1966–June 2008), EMBASE, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Clinical Trial Register was conducted using the standard search strategy of the hypertension review group with additional terms.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized trials of at least one year in duration, comparing one of the six major drug classes with a placebo or no treatment, were included. More than 70% of participants must have had a BP > 140/90 mmHg at baseline.

- **Data collection and analysis**: The outcomes assessed were mortality, stroke, coronary heart disease (CHD), cardiovascular events (CVS), decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and withdrawals due to adverse drug effects. Risk ratio (RR) and a fixed-effects model were used to combine outcomes across trials.

- **Main results**: Of 57 trials identified, 24 trials with 28 arms, including 58,040 patients, met the inclusion criteria. Thiazides (19 RCTs) reduced mortality (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.83, 0.96), stroke (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.57, 0.71), CHD (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.75, 0.95), and CVS (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.66, 0.76). Low-dose thiazides (8 RCTs) reduced CHD (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.61, 0.84), but high-dose thiazides (1 trial) provided insufficient evidence to draw conclusions.

### Zanaflex [^115D1U6f]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Advise patients they should not take Zanaflex if they are taking fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin because of the increased risk of serious adverse reactions, including severe lowering of blood pressure and sedation. Instruct patients to inform their physicians or pharmacists when they start or stop taking any medication because of the risks associated with the interaction between Zanaflex and other medicines.

Tell patients to take Zanaflex exactly as prescribed, consistently either with or without food, and not to switch between tablets and capsules. Inform patients that they should not take more Zanaflex than prescribed, due to the risk of adverse events at single doses greater than 8 mg or total daily doses greater than 36 mg. Advise patients that they should not suddenly discontinue Zanaflex because rebound hypertension and tachycardia may occur.

Warn patients that they may experience hypotension and should be careful when changing from a lying or sitting to a standing position. Inform patients that Zanaflex may cause sedation or somnolence and advise caution when performing activities requiring alertness, such as driving a vehicle or operating machinery. Remind patients that sedation may be additive when Zanaflex is taken with other CNS depressants, such as baclofen, benzodiazepines, or substances like alcohol.

### First-line diuretics versus other classes of antihypertensive drugs for hypertension [^114VRfqY]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). High credibility.

Different first-line drug classes for patients with hypertension are often assumed to have similar effectiveness in reducing mortality, morbidity outcomes, and lowering blood pressure. First-line low-dose thiazide diuretics have been previously shown to have the best mortality and morbidity evidence when compared with placebo or no treatment. Head-to-head comparisons of thiazides with other blood pressure-lowering drug classes could demonstrate important differences.

- **Objectives**: To compare the effects of first-line diuretic drugs with other individual first-line classes of antihypertensive drugs on mortality, morbidity, and withdrawals due to adverse effects in patients with hypertension. Secondary objectives included assessments of the need for added drugs, drug switching, and blood pressure-lowering.

- **Search methods**: Cochrane Hypertension's Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Hypertension Specialized Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and trial registers up to March 2021. Additional studies were identified by checking references and contacting study authors. A top-up search of the Specialized Register was carried out in June 2022.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized active comparator trials of at least one year's duration were included. Trials had a clearly defined intervention arm of a first-line diuretic (thiazide, thiazide-like, or loop diuretic) compared to another first-line drug class: beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, alpha adrenergic blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, or angiotensin II receptor blockers.
