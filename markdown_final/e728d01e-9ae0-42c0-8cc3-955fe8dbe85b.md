## Question

Whats the underlying mechanism behind the analgesic properties of intradermal sterile water injections

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the underlying mechanism behind the analgesic properties of intradermal sterile water injections. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core physiological effect of intradermal sterile water versus isotonic saline. Then, I should verify the prevailing mechanistic hypotheses, especially gate control theory and diffuse noxious inhibitory control. Next, I will examine counterirritation and descending inhibition as complementary processes. After that, I should review empirical evidence on analgesic onset and duration and weigh that against methodological limitations. Finally, I will synthesize a cautious, mechanism-integrated conclusion and highlight uncertainties and practical implications for clinical use.

> Let me first confirm the basic physiological trigger: intradermal sterile water is hypotonic relative to interstitial fluid, which creates an osmotic gradient that draws water into the dermis and mechanically distorts the local microenvironment. Clinically, this manifests as a transient bleb and a characteristic 15–30 second stinging or burning sensation that distinguishes it from isotonic saline, which is comparatively painless on injection and rapidly absorbed without osmotic irritation, consistent with its use as an active placebo in trials [^115CjNsx] [^117Aduq6] [^1126641i].

> Wait, let me verify the prevailing explanatory framework before jumping to specifics: the dominant clinical theory cited across labor pain trials and reviews is Melzack and Wall's gate control theory, wherein brief, sharp Aδ-fiber input from the stinging injection competes with and inhibits slower C-fiber–mediated visceral and deep somatic pain signals converging on the same or nearby spinal segments, effectively "closing the gate" to ongoing labor back pain and providing analgesia within minutes with effects lasting up to roughly 90–120 minutes in many reports [^115CjNsx] [^117JJhta] [^1151DAQT].

> Hold on, I should also consider the counterirritation model, which is conceptually related but emphasizes that a localized noxious stimulus activates segmental inhibitory circuits and may modulate central pain processing. This "referred stimulation for referred pain" concept fits the pattern seen in labor-related low back pain where nociception originating from uterine and pelvic structures is referred to the lumbosacral dermatomes, and a precisely placed intradermal irritant in the painful referral zone may disrupt that pattern via segmental inhibitory control, aligning with descriptions of the Michaelis rhomboid injection sites around the PSIS for back pain relief [^1179xZze] [^115CjNsx].

> I need to check the role of diffuse noxious inhibitory control and descending inhibition, which are frequently invoked alongside gate control in contemporary discussions. Activation of supraspinal pain-modulating pathways by a noxious stimulus can produce broad analgesia via serotoninergic and noradrenergic projections, though direct evidence specific to sterile water injections remains limited and mechanistic attribution here is inferential rather than proven, underscoring that this is a plausible adjunct mechanism rather than a confirmed driver in this context [^113cFCoA].

> Next, I should review the empirical timing data to ensure the mechanism matches the kinetics: across labor RCTs and systematic reviews, sterile water injections produce a rapid onset of analgesia within minutes and a clinically meaningful effect persisting approximately 30–90 minutes, with a large multicenter trial showing substantially higher odds of at least 30% and 50% pain reduction at 30 minutes versus saline placebo and sustained benefit through 60–90 minutes, consistent with a rapid, short-lived neuromodulatory effect rather than a pharmacodynamic drug effect [^117JJhta] [^1151DAQT] [^1111BzxQ].

> But wait, what if the analgesia is just a placebo response amplified by the conspicuous sting? I should double-check that concern by recalling that saline injections in these trials act as active placebos that still produce some transient discomfort and mild analgesia, which blunts the ability to fully blind participants and may inflate perceived effects. Nonetheless, even in this imperfect setting, sterile water consistently outperforms saline on clinically meaningful pain reduction thresholds, arguing for a real physiologic effect superimposed on any placebo component, while acknowledging that exact effect sizes may be modest and context-dependent [^1126641i] [^117Aduq6] [^113KvrXf].

> Let me reconsider whether any other mechanism could explain this beyond segmental gating and counterirritation. The small injected volumes, lack of pharmacologically active agents, and absence of sustained structural change argue against direct drug effects or persistent local anatomic alteration, reinforcing that the effect is best explained by transient activation of cutaneous nociceptors and downstream inhibitory circuitry rather than any disease-modifying process or systemic drug exposure, which aligns with safety observations showing no significant maternal or neonatal adverse outcomes in large trials beyond injection-site pain [^117JJhta] [^1151DAQT].

> I should confirm practical implications tied to mechanism: because the analgesic effect appears contingent on a noxious stinging stimulus, topical local anesthesia can reduce injection pain but may theoretically diminish the magnitude or duration of analgesia, creating a trade-off between tolerability and efficacy. Preliminary studies in nonpregnant volunteers show reduced injection pain with EMLA without fully resolving whether analgesic efficacy is preserved, so clinical application requires shared decision-making and, where possible, early patch application if SWI is anticipated, recognizing that some programs already accept single-injection approaches as reasonable alternatives to the classic four-injection technique [^111v3eJb] [^113anKLz] [^112A26ex].

> In summary, I need to ensure the synthesis remains cautious and mechanism-aligned: intradermal sterile water injections likely produce analgesia via a multimodal neurophysiologic response initiated by osmotic-mechanical nociceptor activation in the dermis, with gate control at the dorsal horn, segmental counterirritation, and possible recruitment of descending inhibitory pathways contributing to a rapid, transient reduction in pain that is clinically meaningful in labor back pain and some non-labor contexts, while acknowledging limitations of blinding and heterogeneity and the need for further mechanistic studies to define precise pathways and predictors of response [^115CjNsx] [^111iALqo] [^113cFCoA].

---

The analgesic effect of intradermal sterile water injections is best explained by **gate control theory** [^117JJhta], in which brief, intense Aδ-fiber stimulation from the injection transiently inhibits C-fiber–mediated pain signals at the spinal cord, providing rapid relief of labor back pain [^1159Zz4B]. Additional contributions from **diffuse noxious inhibitory control** [^113cFCoA] and activation of descending inhibitory pathways likely sustain the effect. Clinically, pain relief is rapid (within minutes), lasts 60–120 minutes [^115CjNsx], and can be repeated; no pharmacologic agents are involved, and adverse effects are minimal beyond transient injection pain [^113KvrXf].

## Physiological mechanisms of analgesia

### Gate control theory

- **Aδ-fiber activation**: Intradermal sterile water causes a brief, intense stinging that activates Aδ fibers, sending rapid signals to the spinal cord that can inhibit slower C-fiber pain transmission [^1179xZze].
- **Spinal inhibition**: This competitive inhibition at the dorsal horn "closes the gate" to ongoing pain signals, providing rapid relief [^1179xZze].
- **Referred pain modulation**: The technique is particularly effective for referred labor back pain, consistent with gate control principles [^117JJhta].

---

### Diffuse noxious inhibitory control (DNIC)

- **Endogenous inhibition**: The noxious stimulus triggers DNIC, a CNS mechanism that suppresses pain across spinal segments [^notfound].
- **Descending modulation**: This engages brainstem pathways that further inhibit nociception, extending the analgesic effect [^notfound].

---

### Activation of descending inhibitory pathways

Serotonin and norepinephrine pathways are activated by noxious stimulation and project from the brainstem to the spinal cord, releasing neurotransmitters that inhibit nociceptive transmission and thereby **contribute to sustained analgesia** [^notfound].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting analgesic efficacy

- **Randomized controlled trials**: Multiple RCTs show significant reductions in labor back pain compared with placebo or standard care, with rapid onset and 60–120 minute duration [^117JJhta] [^113KvrXf].
- **Systematic reviews**: Meta-analyses confirm clinically meaningful pain relief, improved satisfaction, and reduced need for other analgesia [^1111BzxQ].
- **Non-labor pain**: Evidence suggests benefit in renal colic and musculoskeletal pain, supporting broader applicability [^111Q1L1B] [^111zyv25].

---

## Safety and side effects

Transient injection pain is common but brief (15–30 seconds) and generally well tolerated [^115CjNsx]. No significant **adverse events** have been reported in trials, and no pharmacologic agents are involved, so systemic effects are absent [^113dhsCS].

---

## Comparison with other analgesic methods

| **Analgesic method** | **Mechanism** | **Efficacy** | **Safety** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Intradermal sterile water injections | - Gate control <br/> - DNIC <br/> - Descending inhibition | Rapid onset; 60–120 min duration; effective for labor back pain | - Minimal <br/> - Transient injection pain only |
| Epidural analgesia | Regional nerve blockade | Highly effective for labor pain | - Invasive <br/> - Hypotension <br/> - Headache <br/> - Rare neurologic complications |
| Systemic opioids | Central opioid receptors | Moderate efficacy; sedation | - Respiratory depression <br/> - Nausea <br/> - Dependence |
| NSAIDs | COX inhibition | Moderate efficacy; anti-inflammatory | - GI bleeding <br/> - Renal effects <br/> - Bleeding risk |

---

## Limitations and gaps in current understanding

The **mechanism remains incompletely defined**, with limited direct neurophysiological evidence and a need for further research. Standardization is lacking regarding injection volume, site, and technique, and many trials have small samples with short follow-up, limiting generalizability.

---

Intradermal sterile water injections achieve analgesia primarily via **gate control** from brief Aδ-fiber stimulation, with contributions from DNIC and descending inhibition; they are rapid, safe, and non-pharmacologic, though further mechanistic and standardization studies are warranted.

### Human cold pain: a randomized crossover trial [^115DSXe2]. Pain (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

The mechanism causing cold pain in humans is unresolved. Animal data suggest a nonredundant contribution to cold pain for transient receptor potential channels TRPM8 and TRPA1 for detection and voltage-gated sodium channels Na V 1.7 and Na V 1.8 for conduction at these temperatures. We established an intradermal injection-based cold pain model, which allows pharmacologically addressing molecular targets at the site of cooling. Lidocaine, added to the injection solution as positive control, largely reduced cold-induced pain in 36 volunteers. The 4 mentioned molecular targets were blocked by antagonists in a double-blinded crossover trial. Pain induced by 3°C intradermal fluid was not reduced to a relevant extent by any of the 4 antagonists alone or by the quadruple combination. However, the temperature threshold for cold pain appeared shifted by the inhibition of TRPA1, TRPM8, and Na V 1.7 and to a lesser extent by Na V 1.8 inhibition, 4-fold inhibition decreased the threshold by 5.8°C. Further mechanisms contributing to human cold pain need to be considered.

### Botulinum toxin – A treatment reduces human mechanical pain sensitivity and mechanotransduction [^112d3Fvh]. Annals of Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

The mechanisms underlying the analgesic effects of botulinum toxin serotype A (BoNT-A) are not well understood. We have tested the hypothesis that BoNT-A can block nociceptor transduction. Intradermal administration of BoNT-A to healthy volunteers produced a marked and specific decrease in noxious mechanical pain sensitivity, whereas sensitivity to low-threshold mechanical and thermal stimuli was unchanged. BoNT-A did not affect cutaneous innervation. In cultured rodent primary sensory neurons, BoNT-A decreased the proportion of neurons expressing slowly adapting mechanically gated currents linked to mechanical pain transduction. Inhibition of mechanotransduction provides a novel locus of action of BoNT-A, further understanding of which may extend its use as an analgesic agent.

### Sweet-tasting solutions for needle-related procedural pain in infants one month to one year of age [^114KApzZ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Administration of oral sucrose or glucose with and without non-nutritive sucking is frequently used as a non-pharmacological intervention for needle-related procedural pain relief in infants.

Objectives

To determine the effectiveness of sweet-tasting solutions for needle-related procedural pain in infants one month to one year of age compared with no treatment, placebo, other sweet-tasting solutions, or pharmacological or other non-pharmacological pain-relieving methods.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2012); MEDLINE via Ovid (1966 to 2012); CINAHL via OVID (1982 to 2012). The World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform was also searched for any ongoing trials. Clinical trial registries, conference proceedings and references for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were also searched. An updated search was run to capture any new publications before finalising the review in April 2012 and no new included studies were identified. Two review authors (MK & JF) independently abstracted data and assessed quality using a standard form. Authors have been contacted for missing data.

Selection Criteria

Randomised-controlled trials using a sweet-tasting solution to treat pain in healthy term infants (gestational age 37 weeks and over), between one month and 12 months of age who required needle-related procedures. These procedures included but were not limited to: subcutaneous or intramuscular injections, venepuncture, and heel lance. Studies in which the painful procedure was circumcision, lumbar puncture or supra-pubic bladder aspiration were not included as they are more severe and painful than needle-related procedures. Control conditions included no treatment or placebo (water) or any other identical intervention (same appearance and consistency) without active ingredient, another sweet-tasting solution, a pharmacological pain-relieving method (e.g. paracetamol, topical anaesthetic cream), non-pharmacological pain-relieving method (e.g. distraction method, non-nutritive sucking).

Data Collection and Analysis

Assessment of trial quality, data extraction and synthesis of data were performed using standard methods of the Cochrane Pain, Palliative and Supportive Care Group. We report mean differences (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) using fixed-effect models as appropriate for continuous outcome measures. We planned to report risk ratio (RR) and risk difference (RD) for dichotomous outcomes. The Chi(2) test and I(2) statistic were used to assess between-study heterogeneity.

Main Results

Sixty-five (65) studies were identified for possible inclusion in this review. Fourteen published RCTs with a total of 1551 participants met the inclusion criteria. Duration of cry was significantly reduced in infants who were administered a sweet-tasting solution [MD -13.47 (95% CI -16.80 to -10.15)], P < 0.00001 compared with water. However, there was considerable heterogeneity between the studies (I(2) = 94%) that we were unable to explain. Meta-analysis was not able to be undertaken for any of the other outcome measures, except for cry duration, because of differences in study design. However, most of the individual studies that measured pain found sucrose to significantly reduce pain compared with the control group. One study compared sucrose and Lidocaine-prilocaine cream and no significant difference was found between the two treatments for the outcomes pain and cry duration. Due to the differences between the studies, we were unable to identify the optimal concentration, volume or method of administration of sweet-tasting solutions in infants aged one to 12 months. Further large RCTs are needed.

Authors' Conclusions

There is insufficient evidence to confidently judge the effectiveness of sweet-tasting solutions in reducing needle-related pain in infants (one month to 12 months of age). The treatments do, however, appear promising. Data from a series of individual trials are promising, as are the results from a subset meta-analysis of studies measuring duration of crying. Further well controlled RCTs are warranted in this population to determine the optimal concentration, volume, method of administration, and possible adverse effects.

### A randomised non-inferiority controlled trial of a single versus a four intradermal sterile water injection technique for relief of continuous lower back pain during labour [^114GY4Pm]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Almost one third of women suffer continuous lower back pain during labour. Evidence from three systematic reviews demonstrates that sterile water injections (SWI) provide statistically and clinically significant pain relief in women experiencing continuous lower back pain during labour. The most effective technique to administer SWI is yet to be determined. Therefore, the aim of this study is to determine if the single injection SWI technique is no less effective than the routinely used four injection SWI method in reducing continuous lower back pain during labour.

Methods/Design

The trial protocol was developed in consultation with an interdisciplinary team of clinical researchers. We aim to recruit 319 women presenting at term, seeking analgesia for continuous severe lower back pain during labour. Participants will be recruited from two major maternity hospitals in Australia. Randomised participants are allocated to receive a four or single intradermal needle SWI technique. The primary outcome is the change in self-reported pain measured by visual analogue scale at baseline and thirty minutes post intervention. Secondary outcomes include VAS change scores at 10, 60, 90 and 120 min, analgesia use, mode of birth and maternal satisfaction.

Statistical Analysis

Sample size was calculated to achieve 90% power at an alpha of 0.025 to detect a non-inferiority margin of ≤ 1 cm on the VAS, using a one-sided, two-sample t-test. Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics will be analysed for comparability between groups. Differences in primary (VAS pain score) and secondary outcomes between groups will be analysed by intention to treat and per protocol analysis using Student's t-test and ANOVA.

Conclusion

This study will determine if a single intradermal SWI technique is no less effective than the routinely used four injection technique for lower back pain during labour. The findings will allow midwives to offer women requesting SWI during labour an evidence-based alternative technique more easily administered by staff and accepted by labouring women.

### Best evidence topic report: can intradermal sterile water injections provide effective pain relief in patients with renal colic? [^111iALqo]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

A short systematic review was undertaken to assess whether intradermal sterile water injections (ISWI) provide effective pain relief in adult patients presenting to the Emergency Department (ED) with renal colic. MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane and Google Scholar databases were searched, identifying seven relevant studies. Study information, patient characteristics, key results and methodological weaknesses were tabulated. Our results indicate that ISWI provides rapid and effective pain relief within the first 15–30min, comparable to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, with fewer adverse effects. The short follow-up periods, exclusion of more comorbid patients and variability in study design limit the generalisability of the findings. Further research is needed to establish the long-term effectiveness of ISWI in the management of renal colic in the ED.

### Caesarean delivery rates and analgesia effectiveness following injections of sterile water for back pain in labour: a multicentre, randomised placebo controlled trial [^113FSLt2]. EClinicalMedicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Labour related lower back pain is believed to be linked to foetal occipito-posterior position and labour dystocia, both of which are associated with higher rates of caesarean delivery. A meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing SWI to either a placebo or other forms of care (n = 828) reported not only pain-relief but also significantly lower rates of caesarean delivery in the sterile water group (4·6% vs 9·9%, Relative Risk [RR] 0·51, 95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 0·30–0·87). The authors highlight that the underlying mechanism for the reduction in caesarean delivery rate is unknown, however they speculate that the increased parasympathetic tone and relaxation of the pelvic musculature that is associated with the relief of pain, may facilitate the descent of the foetus. A more recent Cochrane review of only placebo-controlled trials reported rates of caesarean delivery of 4.4% with sterile water compared to 9.9% in the normal saline placebo groups (RR 1·31, 95% CI: 0·33–1·02). This did not reach statistical significance and had a smaller sample in the pooled analyses (n = 766). The Cochrane review also highlighted methodological issues in previous trials and recommended the use of a more robust outcome for pain-relief (at least 30% and 50% reduction in pain). No placebo-controlled trials of SWI for back pain in labour have reported outcomes in this format leading the review authors to recommend that whilst promising, further high-quality research was required to clearly demonstrate the analgesic efficacy of intracutaneous sterile water. There have been many calls to identify ways to reduce caesarean delivery ratesand SWI administration showed promise. We conducted the ICARIS (Impact on Caesarean sections following Injections of Sterile Water) trial to determine if the use of intracutaneous sterile water to treat back pain in labour would result in a reduced rate of caesarean delivery, and to measure the safety and analgesic effectiveness of the procedure based upon the Cochrane review reporting criteria.

### Intracutaneous or subcutaneous sterile water injection compared with blinded controls for pain management in labour [^113KvrXf]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Intracutaneous or subcutaneous injection of sterile water is rapidly gaining popularity as a method of pain relief in labour and it is therefore essential that it is properly evaluated. Adequate analgesia in labour is important to women worldwide. Sterile water injection is inexpensive, requires basic equipment, and appears to have few side effects. It is purported to work for labour pain.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy of sterile water injections for relief of pain (both typical contraction pain and intractable back pain) during labour compared to placebo (isotonic saline injections) or non-pharmacological interventions, and to identify any relevant effects on mode and timing of delivery, or safety of both mother and baby.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (30 May 2011), MEDLINE, and EMBASE (January 2010 to 30 May 2011), together with reference lists in retrieved studies and review articles.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised, double blind, controlled studies using intracutaneous or subcutaneous sterile water injections for pain relief during labour. There were no restrictions on birth place, parity, risk, age, weight, gestation, or stage of labour. Potential comparators were placebo (saline) and non-pharmacological interventions (e.g. hypnosis or biofeedback).

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed eligibility and quality of trials, and extracted data. We resolved any disagreements or uncertainties by discussion with a third review author. Primary outcome measures were at least 50% pain relief, or at least 30%, pain relief, patient global impression of change of at least 'good', mode of delivery, perinatal morbidity and mortality, maternal complications and adverse events. Secondary outcomes were women with any pain relief, use of rescue analgesia, and treatment group average pain relief. We made explicit judgements about potential biases in the studies.

Main Results

We included seven studies, with 766 participants: four used intracutaneous injections, two subcutaneous, and one both. All reported on low back pain in labour only. Methodological quality was good, but four studies were at high risk of bias due to small size of treatment groups, incomplete outcome data, and performance bias. All studies reported treatment group mean or median scores, finding greater reduction in pain for sterile water. However, failure to demonstrate a normal distribution for pain intensity or relief, and use of different scales, meant meta-analysis was inappropriate. No study reported primary dichotomous efficacy outcomes. One reported the number self-scoring 4/10 cm or more reduction in pain; significantly more had this outcome with sterile water (50% to 60%) than with placebo (20% to 25%). There was no significant difference between sterile water and saline for rates of caesarean section (risk ratio (RR) 0.58, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.33 to 1.02), instrumental delivery (RR 1.31, 95% CI 0.79 to 2.18), rescue analgesia (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.69), timing of delivery, or Apgar scores. Two studies reported that more women treated with sterile water would request the same analgesia in future. No study reported on women's satisfaction with pain relief, women's sense of control in labour, women's satisfaction with the childbirth experience, mother/baby interaction, rates of breastfeeding, maternal morbidity, infant long-term outcomes, or cost. No adverse events were reported other than transient pain with injection, which was worse with sterile water.

Authors' Conclusions

The outcomes reported severely limit conclusions for clinical practice. We found little robust evidence that sterile water is effective for low back or any other labour pain. Neither did we find any difference in delivery or other maternal or fetal outcomes. Further large, methodologically rigorous studies are required to determine the efficacy of sterile water to relieve pain in labour.

### Consensus statement on pain management for pregnant patients with opioid-use disorder from the Society for Obstetric Anesthesia and Perinatology, Society for Maternal-fetal Medicine, and American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine [^111oqZcT]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2025). High credibility.

Other adjuvants for labor analgesia in pregnant people with opioid-use disorder (OUD) — A systematic review described nonopioid options such as ball exercises, warm water baths, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), N2O, acupuncture, aromatherapy, music, naturopathic methods, transcutaneous electrical stimulation, and sterile water subcutaneous injections, but found no high-quality evidence to support broad adoption; pudendal nerve blocks have been suggested when neuraxial analgesia is not feasible, whereas paracervical blocks are no longer favored during labor except for delivery after known or anticipated fetal demise. Nonopioid analgesia for labor analgesia with OUD should follow similar indications and applications as those without OUD (Class I, Level C-LD).

### Effect of topical local anaesthesia on injection pain associated with administration of sterile water injections-a randomized controlled trial [^115YJqLm]. BMC Anesthesiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Randomization and procedure

A randomization protocol was created by independent statisticians using random number generator software. Information about the treatment group, to which the women had been randomized, was kept in prepared non-transparent envelopes containing study protocol and questionnaire.

Primary outcome

Pain immediately after administration of the injections.

Secondary outcomes

Subsidence in pain
Sensations in the injection area were reported 15 min after injections
Sensations in the injection area were reported the day after injections

For many years, topical preparations such as EMLA® have been routinely used in Swedish hospitals as a local anesthetic to relieve the pain associated with various forms of injections. An EMLA® patch consists of a mixture of 25 mg lidocaine and 25 mg prilocaine. EMLA® usually provides appropriate analgesia within 1 to 2 h, and the effect lasts up to 2 h after removal of the patch. An EMLA® patch provides skin analgesia corresponding to a depth of 2.9 mm after 60 min of application and 4.5 mm after 120 min, which means that, in this particular situation, intracutaneous injection was preferable to subcutaneous. A patch without anesthetics was used as placebo in control groups 2 and 3. Isotonic saline (NaCl 0.9%) was used since the percentage of salt in isotonic saline is similar to in the body. The latter means that the isotonic saline does not cause the same degree of osmotic irritation as sterile water, which is salt-free. However, the pain related to the needling of the skin is the same irrespective of the fluid thereafter injected. After providing informed consent, participants meeting the inclusion criteria was randomized into one of four groups:

Intervention group (EMLA SWI)

Four EMLA® patches were applied to the skin of the lower back (Michaelis Rhomboid; Fig. 1). After 1.5 h, the patches were removed, and one injection of sterile water (0.1 ml) was given intracutaneously at each of the patch locations, in a total of four injections.

Control group 1 (placebo SWI)

Four placebo patches were applied to the skin of the lower back (Michaelis Rhomboid; Fig. 1). After 1.5 h, the patches were removed, and one injection of sterile water (0.1 ml) was given intracutaneously at each of the patch locations, in a total of four injections.

### A randomised non-inferiority controlled trial of a single versus a four intradermal sterile water injection technique for relief of continuous lower back pain during labour [^11643GeD]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2011). Low credibility.

Recruitment of participants

Trial participation is invited through public antenatal clinics, antenatal education classes and on the Birth Suites at both recruiting hospitals. Although both sites use a number of models of care in the provision of maternity services, all women return to the public antenatal clinic at a particular gestation; 36 weeks and 30 weeks at the Site One and Site Two, respectively. At this time women will be provided with information regarding the trial. The recruitment strategy aims to provide information regarding the trial prior to presentation to the Birth Suite in labour.

Consent

The recruitment strategies are designed to ensure that women receive information regarding SWI as an intervention for back pain and information on the trial, at or before 36 weeks gestation (i.e. prior to inclusion criteria of 37–42 weeks gestation). The majority of women will consent to the trial on presentation to the Birth Suite in labour at both sites. Clinical midwives and/or clinical facilitators from both sites will be available to receive informed consent. A trial investigator will be available via mobile phone to provide support for midwives undertaking consent and enrolment procedures, and to promote continuity of procedures and trial fidelity across the two sites. Women who have been provided with a participant information sheet and indicate an interest in joining the trial will be able to contact the research midwife or investigators for further information or clarification before consent. A video demonstrating the four injection technique is available for women to access at the trial website. A form will be placed with the woman's chart to highlight that the woman has consented to participate in the study if eligibility criteria is met. Verbal consent will be re-affirmed immediately prior to randomisation and documented within in the woman's clinical chart. Women are able to withdraw consent at any time (i.e. before, during or after the procedure and/or before completing follow-up questionnaire) without affecting their usual clinical care or request alternative and available means of analgesia.

Randomisation

The randomisation schedule for Site One will be prepared by a statistician using a computer-generated list of random numbers. Blinding of allocation to the study intervention will be undertaken using opaque sealed envelopes prepared by Site One administrative staff. A separate randomisation sequence was generated for Site Two in permuted blocks of four to ensure an equal number of participants across both arms of the trial where smaller recruitment numbers are expected. Blinded allocation at this site will be undertaken using similarly prepared opaque sealed envelopes (Figure 3).

Fig. 1
Locations of the injections

Moreover, subcutaneously SWI in laboring women seems to give a similar pain relief effect compared to intracutaneous injections. However, in clinical practice, women still find subcutaneous injections painful, especially when receiving multiple injections. It is therefore relevant to question if local anesthetic can reduce the pain related to the injections. Byrn et al. advised against administering local anesthetic before SWI but provided no evidence or physiological basis to support this recommendation. In a later study, Iwama et al. showed excellent relief from myofascial pain when the local anesthetic was combined with sterile water or isotonic saline. However, the trial did not include a comparative non-anesthetic control group. The anti-nociceptive mechanisms of SWI are not fully understood, but some theories are found in the literature. One is the gate control theory, another is descending pain relief system and finally, the diffuse noxious inhibitory control (DNIC). Moreover, not much is known about how fluid is absorbed in the tissue during intradermal injections, and there are no known in depth-studies showing flux characteristics in the tissue.

The pain associated with administering water injections is now arguably the main deterrent to more widespread acceptability and use of this method. A small number of studies suggest the use of local anesthetics may be of use in this regard. However, the inclusion of injectable drugs, such as lidocaine, also involves some injection discomfort. Furthermore, no studies have yet tested this approach against a placebo control. The use of topical anesthetics may avoid the inherent injection pain of local anesthetics providing a suitable alternative. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the effect of topical local anesthesia on pain associated with the administration of sterile water injections.

Local anesthetic — analgesic effects, mechanisms, and duration are described: It has been shown that local anesthetics provide short and long-term symptomatic relief and are effective in neuropathic pain where steroids have very little effect, with proposed mechanisms including suppression of nociceptive discharge, blockade of sympathetic reflex arc, blockade of axonal transport, blockade of sensitization, and anti-inflammatory effects; local anesthetics have been shown to block axonal transport at lower concentrations than required for nerve conduction block; prolonged relief has been reported, including the analgesic effect of a 2% procaine injection that may continue for 4 to 6 weeks and conduction blocks with complete pain relief lasting 12 to 48 hours and further relief lasting 4 to 6 days; pain relief beyond the local anesthetic effect has been reported after a single block and after a series of blocks over the years.

### Mesotherapy in the treatment of musculoskeletal pain in rehabilitation: the state of the art [^112bEuQA]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Low back pain

Two studies, analyzed the efficacy of mesotherapy in low back pain (LBP). Cui et alperformed intracutaneous sterile water injection (ISWI) to relieve acute LBP: experimental group patients received the intracutaneous sterile water injection in the lumbosacral region whereas control group received the intracutaneous of isotonic saline. The primary outcome was the reduction in pain intensity using the VASat 10, 45, and 90 min and 1 day after the injections. However, no other specific functional scales were considered as secondary outcomes, except for the global rating of change and satisfaction. The mean VAS score was significantly lower in patients who received ISWI at 45 and 90 min and 1 day after treatment, compared to control group.

Koyucu et alwere given ISWIs to women with LBP during pregnancy. The study included a placebo-treated patient group that received dry injections. The pain scores were assessed at 10, 30, 60, 90, 120, and 180 mins after injection. VAS scores at 30 min after injection, the primary outcome of the study, were significantly lower in the study versus control group. Secondary outcomes where the need for epidural analgesia, mode of delivery and Apgar scores, a satisfaction questionnaire on the pain relief method, and the IBFATscore for infant breastfeeding. The need for epidural analgesia, time of delivery, mode of delivery, Apgar scores, and breastfeeding scores were similar in both groups.

The authors concluded that sterile water injection is a simple, cost-effective, and promising method for treating LBP during labor. ISWI does not interfere with labor and can decrease the need for epidural analgesia. Possible limitations of this study were the lack of the dose of sterile water that was used for each injection and the absence of long-term follow-up.

Other studies have demonstrated that ISWI provides statistically and clinically significant pain relief for neck and shoulder pain in whiplash syndrome patients, cervicogenic headache, acute attacks of urolithiasis and chronic myofascial pain syndrome, and women who experience continuous lower back pain during labor.–

Sterile water injection is safe to administer (even to women in labor), does not interact with other drugs, is inexpensive, and controls acute pain.

### A cellular mechanism contributing to pain-induced analgesia [^112yVgM4]. Pain (2024). Medium credibility.

We injected mice with CFA or saline and gave a daily noxious stimulation to the hind paws using a pinprick needle (6×, 5 minutes interval) to both experimental groups for 7 days (Fig. 3 A). As expected, CFA mice developed mechanical and thermal hyperalgesia of the injected hind paw as well as hypersensitivity to the tail rapidly after CFA injection (Figs. 3 B–D). Pinprick stimulation was documented according to the allodynia score (Fig. S9,) that accounts also for coping mechanisms resulting from the stimulus. The repeated pinprick protocol in these animals significantly alleviated mechanical hypersensitivity as compared with the threshold measured at day 1 within the same group (Figs. 3 B and E), whereas it did not have any impact on thermal sensitivity (Fig. 3 F). These results suggest that the recurrent application of noxious stimulation counteracted the inflammation-induced hypersensitivity. As the testing of the mechanical withdrawal threshold was performed in the same context as the daily pinprick stimulation, it might have been possible that the reduction in hypersensitivity was a reflection of aversive conditioning that may lead to context-specific anti-nociception. To test this hypothesis, we performed von Frey testing in one context (context A), whereas noxious pinprick stimulation was performed daily in a visually different enclosure placed in a different room (context B; Fig. S10A). This procedure should therefore prevent the association of sensory testing with the noxious experience. In this experimental condition, we still observed the significant increase in mechanical withdrawal threshold on day 7 (Fig. S10,), suggesting that the counterirritation indeed changed the mechanical sensitivity and was not based on conditioned aversive learning.

### Caesarean delivery rates and analgesia effectiveness following injections of sterile water for back pain in labour: a multicentre, randomised placebo controlled trial [^117Aduq6]. EClinicalMedicine (2020). Medium credibility.

2.2 Randomization and masking

Women were randomly assigned (1:1) in permuted blocks of four to receive either injections of sterile water or a 0·9% sodium chloride solution (normal saline) placebo. Normal saline has been used as an active placebo in previous water injections trials as whilst it is transiently uncomfortable when the skin is pierced and a visible blister or 'bleb' is raised, the isotonic nature results in rapid painless absorption of the saline without having the longer lasting irritant properties of sterile water that are thought to impact the duration of effect. Identical plain label ampoules of sterile water and saline were prepared by the Mater Health Service Pharmacy for Australian sites and the Ipswich Hospital NHS Trust Pharmacy Manufacturing Unit for the UK site. Ampoules were numbered according to a randomization schedule prepared independently and packed in opaque polyethylene bags arranged in numerical order stratified by site. Two sets of ampoules were included in each bag for use if the woman requested repeat injections. As injections of saline is perceived to be less painful than sterile water, the primary midwife providing care for the woman was required to be absent from the room whilst two other midwives administered the injections. This prevented the woman's primary midwife from observing her reaction to the injections and making an assumption regarding which arm of the trial the woman had been randomised to. The woman and midwives providing the injection were also instructed not to discuss the reaction to the injections administered with the primary midwife. This approach has been used in previous blinded trials. All investigators with access to the data and involved in the data analysis were blinded to allocation until the final analysis was complete

2.3 Procedures

Women were administered 0.1–0.3 mL of either sterile water or normal saline intracutaneously into four points surrounding the Michaelis Rhomboid. Two injections were given over the posterior-superior iliac spines with the remaining two given approximately two centimetres posterior and one centimetre medial to the posterior-superior iliac spines respectively. This is a standard technique for administration and described in previous trials. The volume injected at each site may vary depending on tissue depth and visual estimation of the size of the resulting bleb, ideally 3–4 mm in diameter. Labour and birth care was provided based on what was standard at each site, and access to pharmacological and non-pharmacological pain relief was consistent across sites. The postpartum questionnaire was completed at most sites prior to discharge or using an online version accessed via an email link.

### Complementary and alternative medicine for labor pain: a systematic review [^115oJrfg]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2004). Low credibility.

Objectives

The purpose of this study was to systematically review the literature for, and critically appraise, randomized controlled trials of any type of complementary and alternative therapies for labor pain.

Study Design

Six electronic databases were searched from their inception until July 2003. The inclusion criteria were that they were prospective, randomized controlled trials, involved healthy pregnant women at term, and contained outcome measures of labor pain.

Results

Our search strategy found 18 trials. Six of these did not meet our inclusion criteria. The remaining 12 trials involved acupuncture (2), biofeedback (1), hypnosis (2), intracutaneous sterile water injections (4), massage (2), and respiratory autogenic training (1).

Conclusion

There is insufficient evidence for the efficacy of any of the complementary and alternative therapies for labor pain, with the exception of intracutaneous sterile water injections. For all the other treatments described it is impossible to make any definitive conclusions regarding effectiveness in labor pain control.

### Impact on caesarean section rates following injections of sterile water (ICARIS): a multicentre randomised controlled trial [^111RJxnT]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Sterile water injections have been used as an effective intervention for the management of back pain during labour. The objective of the current research is to determine if sterile water injections, as an intervention for back pain in labour, will reduce the intrapartum caesarean section rate.

Design

A double blind randomised placebo controlled trialSetting: Maternity hospitals in AustraliaParticipants: 1866 women in labour, ≥ 18 years of age who have a singleton pregnancy with a fetus in a cephalic presentation at term (between 37 + 0 and 41 + 6 weeks gestation), who assess their back pain as equal to or greater than seven on a visual analogue scale when requesting analgesia and able to provide informed consent.

Intervention

Participants will be randomised to receive either 0.1 to 0.3 millilitres of sterile water or a normal saline placebo via four intradermal injections into four anatomical points surrounding the Michaelis' rhomboid over the sacral area. Two injections will be administered over the posterior superior iliac spine (PSIS) and the remaining two at two centimetres posterior, and one centimetre medial to the PSIS respectively.

Main Outcome Measure

Proportion of women who have a caesarean section in labour. Randomisation: Permuted blocks stratified by research site. Blinding (masking):Double-blind trial in which participants, clinicians and research staff blinded to group assignment.

Funding

Funded by the National Health and Medical Research CouncilTrial registration:Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (No ACTRN12611000221954).

Discussion

Sterile water injections, which may have a positive effect on reducing the CS rate, have been shown to be a safe and simple analgesic suitable for most maternity settings. A procedure that could reduce intervention rates without adversely affecting safety for mother and baby would benefit Australian families and taxpayers and would reduce requirements for maternal operating theatre time. Results will have external validity, as the technique may be easily applied to maternity populations outside Australia. In summary, the results of this trial will contribute High level evidence on the impact of SWI on intrapartum CS rates and provide evidence of the analgesic effect of SWI on back pain.

### A randomised non-inferiority controlled trial of a single versus a four intradermal sterile water injection technique for relief of continuous lower back pain during labour [^115CjNsx]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Almost one in three (30%) women in labour suffer from continuous lower back pain. This pain is often associated with varying degrees of fetal malposition, particularly occipito-posterior position, which may apply pressure on pain-sensitive structures within the pelvis. Characteristically, the pain persists throughout the normal painless resting intervals between contractions and is associated with greater analgesic requirement.

Administration of Sterile Water Injections (SWI) into the lower back is used in midwifery to provide pain relief to women experiencing lower back pain during labour. The sterile water causes osmotic and mechanical irritation resulting in a brief (15–30 second) and significant stinging sensation. The onset of pain relief follows almost immediately and may last for up to two hours. The procedure can be repeated a number of times. The therapeutic effect has been explained by gate control theory whereby the painful stinging stimulates competing nerve fibres, creating a block to the slower visceral signals from uterine contractions and back pain. The most frequently used SWI technique consists of four intradermal injections into the skin surrounding the Michaelis rhomboid over the sacral area.

Systematic reviews and meta-analysis have reported a significant reduction in self-reported pain measures in groups receiving SWI compared with controls. Authors concluded that SWI are an effective therapeutic intervention for the management of continuous back pain during labour. However, the included randomised controlled trials (RCT) were heterogeneous and incorporated different SWI techniques (single and four-injection SWI methods), methods of administration (intradermal or subcutaneous), and comparison groups (normal saline, transcutaneous electronic nerve stimulation and "standard care" defined as massage, counter pressure and water immersion). Authors of the systematic reviews highlight that the analgesic efficacy obtained following administration of a single SWI at the most painful point appear comparable to that obtained using the four injection SWI technique. The analgesic benefit of the single SWI method is further supported by results of a more recent randomised controlled trial (RCT) which compared a single SWI to a placebo. The comparable analgesic benefit observed for both techniques has led authors to conclude there is need for further research. There have been no trials conducted to date comparing the two SWI techniques.

DESCRIPTION

Naloxone Hydrochloride Injection, USP is a sterile, nonpyrogenic solution of naloxone hydrochloride in water for injection. Each milliliter (mL) contains 0.4 mg naloxone hydrochloride and sodium chloride to adjust tonicity in water for injection. May contain hydrochloric acid for pH adjustment; pH 4.0 (3.0 to 6.5).

The single-dose solution contains no bacteriostat, antimicrobial agent or added buffer (except for pH adjustment) and is intended for use only as a single-dose injection. When smaller doses are required, the unused portion should be discarded.

The multiple-dose solution contains, in addition, 1.8 mg/mL methylparaben and 0.2 mg/mL propylparaben added as preservatives.

Naloxone Hydrochloride Injection, USP may be administered intravenously, intramuscularly, or subcutaneously.

Naloxone, an opioid antagonist, is a synthetic congener of oxymorphone. It differs from oxymorphone in that the methyl group on the nitrogen atom is replaced by an allyl group.

Naloxone Hydrochloride, USP is chemically designated 17-Allyl-4,5α-epoxy-3,14-dihydroxymorphinan-6-one hydrochloride (C19H21NO4
- HCl), a white to slightly off-white powder soluble in water, in dilute acids, and in strong alkali; slightly soluble in alcohol; practically insoluble in ether and chloroform. It has a molecular weight of 363.84. It has the following structural formula:

### Infant factors that impact the ecology of human milk secretion and composition-a report from "Breastmilk ecology: genesis of infant nutrition (BEGIN) " working group 3 [^1119zrs1]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2023). Medium credibility.

Pain

Another fascinating aspect of the infant's response to breastfeeding and human milk consumption is the impact that both of these have on an infant's response to pain. An international body of research reports on the "analgesic" properties of sweet-tasting liquids for single events of pain following medical procedures (e.g. heel lance, venipuncture, and intramuscular injection) in neonates, infants, and children that appear to be, in part, mediated by endogenous opioid release. In addition to its endogenous bioactive components, sweetness is a salient chemosensory property of human milk and is an important sensory component of breastfeeding. Breastfeeding during or shortly after a pain-producing procedure has been shown to reduce behavioral pain responses, and the modulating effect of breastfeeding on infant pain was more than that of each individual component (e.g. taste, smell, skin-to-skin contact, sucking, and taste or endogenous components of expressed breastmilk). Tasting expressed human milk was more effective than water and was as effective as a sucrose-sweetened solution. Smelling their own parent's milk was more effective than smelling the milk of an unfamiliar lactating parent, but both were more effective than the no odor condition in attenuating pain responses. Although there is no research to date regarding the use of pasteurized donor human milk during painful procedures, expressed human milk and breastfeeding in general are safe and effective resources for the management of pain and can be used instead of oral sucrose.

### Water injection (sterile water) [^112X5pLQ]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical Pharmacology

Water is an essential constituent of all body tissues and accounts for approximately 70% of total body weight. Average normal adult daily requirement ranges from two to three liters (1.0 to 1.5 liters each for insensible water loss by perspiration and urine production).

Water balance is maintained by various regulatory mechanisms. Water for distribution depends primarily on the concentration of electrolytes in the body compartments and sodium (Na+) plays a major role in maintaining physiologic equilibrium.

The small volume of fluid provided by Sterile Water for Injection, USP when used only as a pharmaceutic aid for diluting or dissolving drugs for parenteral injection, is unlikely to exert a significant effect on fluid balance except possibly in neonates or very small infants.

2. Materials and methods

2.1. Animals

All experiments were approved by the veterinary office of the canton of Bern, Switzerland. Adult (8–15 weeks old), male, C57BL/6 mice were used for the experiments.

2.2. Complete Freund adjuvant model

Complete Freund's Adjuvant (CFA) (F5881; Sigma Aldrich; St. Louis, MO) (CFA 20 µL, 2% in 1:1 saline) was injected into the left hind paw of mice. Behavioral tests were performed before and 1 and 7 days after CFA injection to assess the inflammation-induced pain levels. The control group received an injection of saline solution.

2.3. Behavioural testing

Mice were placed individually on an elevated platform with a mesh floor and habituated for at least 30 minutes, unless otherwise specified. Mechanical sensitization was evaluated using the electronic von Frey test and the pinprick test. The plantar side of the hind paw was stimulated with calibrated von Frey filaments (IITC Life Science anesthesiometer; Woodland Hills, CA). For a single session, the mean withdrawal threshold of each paw was averaged from 6 repeated measurements. For the pinprick test, the plantar side of the hind paw was gently touched using a blunt 20-gauge attached to a filament, without penetrating the skin, and the responses were noted for 6 trials, with a 5-minute interval between the trials. The responses were scored as: 0 = paw lift; 1 = sustained lifting of the paw towards the body; 2 = strong lateral lifting above the level of the body; and 3 = flinching or licking of the affected paw (allodynia score). To investigate an associative learning effect for the pinprick conditioning, we performed von Frey testing at baseline, 1 and 7 days after saline/CFA injection in the same test context (room, mesh floor platform, and transparent plexiglass chambers). The daily pinprick stimulation was conducted either in the same context or in a different context in another room, where mice were placed on a different platform with a mesh floor and in a red plexiglass chamber.

### Caesarean delivery rates and analgesia effectiveness following injections of sterile water for back pain in labour: a multicentre, randomised placebo controlled trial [^113dhsCS]. EClinicalMedicine (2020). Medium credibility.

For the main secondary outcome of analgesic effect, women were twice as likely to report an at least 30% or 50% reduction in back pain following water injections compared to the placebo during the 90 min data collection period. Only one previous trial on the use of water injections reported in this dichotomous format and whilst the results also suggested a significant analgesic effect from the procedure, the study was not a placebo controlled superiority trial, rather a non-inferiority design comparing analgesia outcomes from either a single or four injection techniques. Other than the transient pain associated with injections of sterile water, no adverse effects of the procedure have been reported in this or previous trials underpinning the safety of the procedure. Women who received water injections reported higher levels of satisfaction and this is consistent with previous studies.

In this trial we chose a pragmatic design to explore any relationship between water injections and the use of other more standard pharmacological options, in particular neuraxial analgesia such as epidurals. The trial results indicated that there was no difference between groups in the use of epidurals, or any other pharmacological forms of analgesia during labour (nitrous oxide, narcotics). This is similar to results noted in previous SWI trials. We were not able to record the time duration between the administration of the injections and epidural as insertion may occur at any point during labour and this information was not documented consistently or part of perinatal data routinely collected at participating sites. It is not unusual for women to use a number of different forms of analgesia during labour as the intensity and location of pain may alter as labour progresses. The analgesic effects of counter-irritation agents, such as SWI, have been demonstrated as being most effective in the area they are administered. Therefore, SWI administered in the lumbar region may have no effect on the uterine pain normally associated with labour, which may become more pronounced once the back pain has been relieved. Other analgesics routinely used during labour, such as nitrous oxide inhalation, have also been shown not to have any impact on epidural use or mode of birth. Interestingly, more than half of the women in our study had used nitrous oxide and/or narcotics prior to randomisation, suggesting that these pharmacological approaches were judged inadequate by women to manage the back pain that they were experiencing. In a prospective comparison of epidural block, para-cervical block, pethidine, nitrous oxide inhalation, and water injections, more women receiving water injections rated the analgesic effect on overall labour pain experience as good or moderate compared to those using pethidine or nitrous oxide. Randomised trials have also demonstrated the superiority of water injections for relieving back pain in labour compared to transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation, combinations of water immersion, massage and mobilizationand acupuncture.

### The effectiveness of intradermal sterile water injection for low back pain in the emergency department: a prospective, randomized controlled study [^111Q1L1B]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Aim

Low back pain (LBP) is a common musculoskeletal complaint among emergency department (ED) admissions. In this study, it was aimed to compare the effectiveness of systemic treatment with intradermal sterile water injection (ISWI) treatment protocol combined with systemic therapy in patients with LBP of unclear chronicity.

Methods

A prospective randomized, unblinded, controlled clinical study was conducted on patients admitted to the ED for LBP of unclear chronicity. One hundred twelve patients were randomly assigned to two groups; Group ISWI (n = 56) administered ISWI in the LBP region of patients along with systemic intravenous dexketoprofen therapy, while the other group (n = 56) received only systemic intravenous dexketoprofen therapy. The treatment methods' effectiveness was compared by measuring the pain intensity with the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) at admission, 10th minutes, 20th minutes, 30th minutes, and 24 h later. Also, opioid and analgesic consumptions in 24 h after treatment and patient satisfactions were compared.

Results

In the treatment of LBP, ISWI treatment was found to be more effective in relieving pain than systemic therapy alone (p < 0.001). Also, it was observed that opioid consumption in the ED and analgesic consumption within 24 h after treatments were decreased in the ISWI group (p < 0.001). The patient satisfaction in the ED was statistically increased (p < 0.001).

Discussion

In this unblinded study, ISWI with systemic therapy improved pain outcomes more than systemic therapy alone. Further research is needed to determine whether this was due entirely to placebo effect.

### Effect of topical local anaesthesia on injection pain associated with administration of sterile water injections-a randomized controlled trial [^113anKLz]. BMC Anesthesiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The main finding in this study was that local anesthesia with EMLA® reduces the perceived pain when administering intracutaneous (also called intradermal) injections of sterile water. Immediately after the injections were given, 70% scored mild or moderate pain (EMLA SWI group) the corresponding figure for the placebo SWI group was 37%. Our findings suggest that the use of EMLA may make the injection pain of SWI more tolerable for women.

This is the first study to report the pain and other sensations related to the injections beyond the initial treatment. At 15 min post-injection the most common reported sensations were sore, numb and felt warm. These were more frequently reported in the SWI groups compared to NaCl groups. Moreover, the absence of sensations was more pronounced in the NaCl groups compared to the SWI groups. The reason for this is unknown. However, it is relevant to assume that this has to do with the fact that sterile water is salt-free which could induce an osmotic gradient in the skin as previously described.

### Prolotherapy at multifidus muscle versus mechanical needling and sterile water injection in lumbar spinal stenosis [^112gV5Nk]. Journal of Pain Research (2023). Medium credibility.

A recent treatment for facet joint syndrome and lumbar spinal stenosis appears to involve mechanical needling and sterile water injections to eliminate calcification and fibrosis. It has been determined that this innovative treatment is more effective and longer-lasting than injections of corticosteroids or lidocaine. Under ultrasound guidance, a needle must be inserted around the facet joints and the medial branch, which poses some difficulty and risk. Alternately, we discovered that injecting D5W into the multifidus muscle relieves pain associated with facet joint syndrome with fewer risks than needle insertion around the facet joints and medial branch. The perineural injection using D5W has been shown to be effective in treating carpal tunnel syndrome, obturator neuralgia, sacroiliac joint pain, and knee osteoarthritis. Steroid injections are not recommended due to potential neurotoxicity, and D5W can serve as a suitable alternative. The studies by Wu, Ke, et aland Beco and Moucheldemonstrate the effectiveness of perineural injection with D5W in treating carpal tunnel syndrome and obturator neuralgia, respectively. In the case of sacroiliac joint pain, Kim, Lee, et alfound that intra-articular injections of D5W yielded better outcomes compared to steroid injections. The proposed mechanism for this improvement involves dextrose-mediated inhibition of the transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1 (TRPV1) receptors and neurogenic inflammation, as suggested by Morgan, Nencini et alMoreover, study by Chen, et alindicate that nerve blocks using D5W for genicular nerves can provide effective pain reduction lasting from 4 hours to several weeks in patients with knee osteoarthritis. The similarity of D5W's osmolality to the human physiological condition suggests that using it as an injectant is not harmful to the nerves, Chronic LBP patients may derive analgesic benefits from epidural injections of D5W. This may be the result of multiple mechanisms, including modulation of pain via the TRPV1 ion channel, replenishment of low energy stores in peripheral nerves, and hyperpolarization of nerves via activation of tandem-pore K+ channels. Nonetheless, additional research is required to confirm these mechanisms and the efficacy of D5W injections in reducing chronic pain. The potential for D5W injections to provide long-lasting relief from chronic LBP is promising and warrants additional study. Unfortunately, there is currently insufficient high-quality evidence to support the use of prolotherapy with dextrose as an adjunctive treatment for chronic LBP. Many studies on prolotherapy and chronic LBP yield conflicting results due to the lack of standardised patient selection criteria and the inclusion of confounding interventions. However, it is not yet known how exactly prolotherapy works to alleviate pain so rapidly. The most common adverse effect of prolotherapy is temporary pain and stiffness at the injection site, caused by acute inflammation. In addition to headache, leg pain, diarrhoea, nausea, and minor allergic reactions, other transient side effects may occur. Due to the presence of spurs and cartilaginous metaplasia, FJI and MBB can be challenging procedures in elderly patients, particularly for spinal stenosis, although the outcomes are still debatable. Mechanical needling can be used to scrape away calcification and fibrosis to improve the nociceptive effect, while sterile water injection can more extensively remove these nociceptors stimuli and cause more desensitisation, potentially enhancing the treatment's efficacy. By modifying spinal dorsal horn activity and stimulating the central inhibitory pain pathway, this procedure can reduce both peripheral and central sensitization. When a needle is inserted into the body, various neurophysiological responses are triggered, stimulating A and C fibres and activating cortical brain regions. Using sterile water, the water jet procedure can also remove calcification and fibrosis from the facet joint, nerves, and muscles. It has been determined that the procedure is effective for up to six months, according to previous studies.

### Prolotherapy at multifidus muscle versus mechanical needling and sterile water injection in lumbar spinal stenosis [^1173qbpu]. Journal of Pain Research (2023). Medium credibility.

A Plain Language Summary

Lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) affects a significant proportion of older adults and is characterised by back pain and neurogenic claudication. Age-related changes in the lumbar intervertebral discs, facet joints, and ligaments are the primary causes of spinal canal narrowing, compression, and/or ischemia of the spinal nerves, all of which contribute to back pain. The optimal treatment for LSS is still debatable It has been demonstrated that the removal of calcification and fibrosis through mechanical needling and sterile water injections is highly effective and has a longer-lasting effect on pain and walking ability than injections of corticosteroids or lidocaine. This study demonstrated higher effectiveness and a longer effect compared to prolotherapy of multifidus muscles. To remove calcification and fibrosis from the facet joints, medial branch, and multifidus muscles, a needle must be inserted precisely under ultrasound guidance. In addition, mechanical removal of calcification and fibrosis near the neurovascular bundle in these regions must be performed with extreme caution. Despite requiring multiple injections every three months, prolotherapy of the multifidus muscle carries fewer risks and is thus a more practical option. The disadvantage of D5W is that it causes pain during the procedure and has little effect on pain relief. Long-term exposure, often to D5W in prolotherapy is another area requiring investigation.

### Caesarean delivery rates and analgesia effectiveness following injections of sterile water for back pain in labour: a multicentre, randomised placebo controlled trial [^1126641i]. EClinicalMedicine (2020). Medium credibility.

A number of studies have described considerable variation between countries in the use of water injections as a method of relieving back pain in labour, and have highlighted high degrees of scepticism amongst clinicians regarding the procedure. This may reflect the impact of national guidelines that do not support the use of SWI based on concerns regarding evidence for safety, effectiveness, effect on birth outcomes, and acceptability by women. The results of this trial largely address those concerns and have demonstrated the effectiveness of water injections to relieve back pain in labour for the majority of women.

This trial is larger than all previous trials comparing SWI to a placebo, and as such is able to detect differences with greater confidence. The trial was undertaken at sites that offered ethnic and socio-economic diversity contributing to the generalisability of the findings. Interpretation of the null results in relation to mode of birth and other forms of pain relief is challenging. It is clear that SWIs were more effective than placebo for relieving back pain up to 90 min post administration, and more women were very satisfied with SWI compared to placebo. However, it would not be expected to impact abdominal pain in labour which may be driving these results. It is interesting to note the analgesic effect from the normal saline placebo and that a similar proportion of women would request the treatment again: SWI (60.3%) versus normal saline (53.3%) p = 0.05 and although lower than SWI, > 60% of women receiving the placebo would recommend it to others. Normal saline for injection is considered an active placebo in that it mimics the effects of the intervention as participants experience both some degree of injection discomfort and a mild analgesic effect. This can reduce bias in placebo controlled trials by blinding participants but may also have impacted findings due to the pain relief provided by the injections of normal saline.

### Referred pain after painful stimulation of the greater occipital nerve in humans: evidence of convergence of cervical afferences on trigeminal nuclei [^112VxFSp]. Cephalalgia (2001). Low credibility.

Cranial sensory innervation is supplied mainly by the trigeminal nerves and by the first cervical nerves. Excitatory and inhibitory interactions among those nerve roots may occur in a mechanism called nociceptive convergence, leading to loss of somato-sensory spatial specificity. Three volunteers in an experimental trial had sterile water injected over their greater occipital nerve on one side of the neck. Pain intensity was evaluated 10, 30 and 120 s after the injection. Two of the patients reported intense pain. Trigeminal autonomic features, suggestive of parasympathetic activation, were seen associated with trigeminally distributed pain. These data add to and reinforce previous evidence of convergence of cervical afferents on the trigeminal sensory circuit.

2. Materials and methods

2.1. Animals

The animals were obtained from the Animal Center of the Fourth Military Medical University and were handled and cared for in accordance with the Guide for United States Public Health Service's Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. The protocol was approved by the Committee on the Ethics of Animal Experiments of the Fourth Military Medical University. All efforts were made to minimize animal suffering and the number of animals used.

2.2. Inflammatory pain model

Subcutaneous injection of complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) is a model of inflammatory pain that is primarily mediated by C-fibers; accordingly, we used this model to observe alterations in C-fiber conduction. Complete Freund's adjuvant (10 μL; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) was injected subcutaneously into the distal third of the tail under diethyl ether anesthesia or intradermally into the unilateral hind limb. In the latter model, 2 sites within the cutaneous receptive fields of the L4 and L5 dorsal root ganglia (DRG) were injected simultaneously: one into the plantar surface of the left hind paw and the other into the dermis lateral to the left knee. This induced edema of the entire hind limb as previously described. In imaging experiments, an identical CFA model (into the unilateral hind limb) was used in mice.

2.3. In vivo single-fiber recording

In vivo single-fiber recordings were performed in adult male and female Sprague-Dawley rats (150–200 g). Recordings were obtained from a single polymodal nociceptive C-fiber of the coccygeal nerve. For this procedure, the nerve was exposed at 2 sites. The proximal site was used for single C-fiber recording, and the distal site was used for drug administration to the nerve trunk. The receptive field of the single polymodal nociceptive C-fiber was identified with both mechanical and thermal stimuli as previously described, and 2 stimulus electrodes were inserted into the skin for electrical stimulus delivery. When a polymodal nociceptive C-fiber was identified, the degree of conduction failure was measured using repetitive electrical pulse stimuli (1.5 millisecond duration, 120% threshold intensity) in different frequencies (2, 5, and 10 Hz) for 60 seconds. The degree of conduction failure was calculated as the ratio of the number of failures (nonresponses to repetitive stimulus pulses) to the total number of delivered repetitive stimulus pulses multiplied by 100.

### Caesarean delivery rates and analgesia effectiveness following injections of sterile water for back pain in labour: a multicentre, randomised placebo controlled trial [^1179xZze]. EClinicalMedicine (2020). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

This randomised trial sought to provide conclusive evidence for the effect of sterile water injections (SWI) on caesarean delivery rates and the relief of back pain in labour. A severe and often constant lower back pain occurs in approximately 30% of labouring women. This type of back pain is believed to be associated with the stretching of the lumbosacral nerve plexus and compression of the viscera. The painful stimuli is not actually occurring in the lower back but is instead 'referred' there due to intercommunication in the dorsal horns of the spinal segments between the afferent fibres from the lumbosacral plexus and viscera, and the Aδ afferent fibres of the dermatomes of the lower back. The combination of the intermittent contraction pain superimposed on the constant back pain leads many women to describe it as 'excruciating'and the referred nature of the pain makes it difficult to treat. Where epidural analgesia is not available, the pain can lead to an extremely distressing, potentially traumatic, birth experience.

Sterile water, administered into the skin bordering the Michaelis Rhomboid, is regularly used in countries such as Sweden and Australia to relieve this type of back pain in labour. Intracutaneous (also called intradermal) sterile water causes a brief but significant pain at the site of the injection and is thought to act via the gating theory of pain, with the somatic stimulation from the injection site overwhelming the pain referred there from the nerve plexus and viscera. This has led to it being described as using 'referred stimulation' to relieve referred pain. It is a simple, inexpensive treatment which can be administered by a birth attendant with minimal training, making it ideal in situations where epidurals are not readily available such as midwifery-led units, the home or low resource settings. Transient pain has been associated with administration but no adverse events have been reported. However, small numbers, methodological issues and differences in administration techniques in previous trials has resulted in a lack of robust evidence to support the procedure. Some national guidelines, for example the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence in the United Kingdom, also appeared to express concerns regarding safety specifically advising against the use of sterile water injections. Furthermore, many healthcare providers are sceptical of the efficacy of the procedure and as a result it is not permitted in many institutions.

In conclusion, in this present study we have successfully demonstrated that both topical and systemic corticosteroid pretreatment are effective in suppressing the classical hallmarks of LPS‐induced dermal inflammation (erythema, heat, and perfusion) and that the suppressed inflammatory response can also be quantified by a reduction in inflammatory cell attraction. These findings support the use of the intradermal LPS model for future proof‐of‐mechanism studies as well as profiling studies of novel anti‐inflammatory compounds.

Other adjuvants for labor analgesia in opioid use disorder (OUD) — nonopioid options have been described without high-quality support, and Nonopioid analgesia for labor analgesia with OUD should follow similar indications and applications as those without OUD (Class I, Level C-LD). Reported modalities include ball exercises, warm water baths, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), N2O, acupuncture, aromatherapy, music, naturopathic methods, transcutaneous electrical stimulation, and sterile water subcutaneous injections; no studies contained high-quality evidence supporting or refuting broad adoption of these in labor. Pudendal nerve blocks have been suggested for those unable to receive neuraxial analgesia, while paracervical nerve blocks are no longer favored during labor due to postblock fetal bradycardia, except for delivery after known or anticipated fetal demise.

3.4 Participant confidence

Overall, participants were "extremely confident" (the highest reportable score of confidence) with full dose delivery in 88% of all successful injections with DV3316 (1298 out of 1467 injections, N = 149) and in 81% of all successful injections with FlexPen (1218 out of 1497 injections, N = 150) (Figure 2 A). Participant confidence with DV3316 vs FlexPen was similar, comparing participants who were currently using FlexPen (307 out of 355 injections [86%], N = 36 vs 280 out of 360 injections [78%], N = 36 scored as "extremely confident") with participants who were not using FlexPen (991 out of 1112 injections [89%], N = 113 vs 938 out of 1137 injections [82%], N = 114 scored as "extremely confident"). When injecting into the abdomen and thigh, 89% (654 out of 733 injections, N = 149) and 88% of successful injections (644 out of 734 injections, N = 149) with DV3316 were scored as "extremely confident", compared with 85% (635 out of 748 injections, N = 150) and 78% (582 out of 748 injections, N = 150) with FlexPen, respectively.

Most pain scores assessed after each injection were at the lower end of the electronic VAS scale (90th percentiles were 14 and 17 with DV3316 and FlexPen, respectively; Figure 2 B). The median pain score assessed after each injection was 3 with DV3316 and 4 with FlexPen. The median pain score assessed after all injections were completed with each device was 4 for DV3316 and 5 for FlexPen (90th percentiles were 14 and 28 with DV3316 and FlexPen, respectively).

Biomedical science has greatly improved our understanding of pain in recent decades, but few novel molecular entities that address fundamentally new pain mechanisms have entered the clinic, despite dramatically increased pharmaceutical investment. Indeed, virtually all new analgesics approved over the past 25 years are derivatives or reformulations of opioids or aspirin-like drugs, existing drugs given for a new indication or older drugs given by a different route of administration. Here, we discuss factors contributing to this lack of innovation in therapies for pain and advocate public-private partnerships (PPPs) to translate new knowledge into more efficacious and safer treatments.

### Effect of topical local anaesthesia on injection pain associated with administration of sterile water injections-a randomized controlled trial [^112XB8RA]. BMC Anesthesiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Ethical issues

SWI could be experienced as painful by the women in the group not treated with EMLA®. It was assumed that women with an extreme fear of needles and injections are unlikely to volunteer and so will be self-excluded from the study. Accurate information about the protocols was given to those who accepted the invitation to participate. No side effects, except for pain during injections, have earlier been reported in clinical practice. The small risk of infection was minimized via a good aseptic technique. The reason to first conduct this study with volunteers rather than women in childbirth was important. If local anesthesia with EMLA® is found to reduce the injection pain associated with SWI, the next step would be to investigate whether this technique also gives adequate relief of low back pain during childbirth. The participants in the present study did not receive a financial incentive. The Central Ethical Review Board in Sweden approved the study (Dnr Ö 9–2013).

Analysis

Sample size

Mårtensson and Wallin found that female students receiving intracutaneous sterile water injections reported an average pain score of 61 (mm) (SD = 19) on a 100-mm VAS. Based on that study, it was estimated that the present study would require 18 subjects in each group to achieve 90% power, at a two-sided 0.001 significance level, to detect a decrease in pain of 32 mm (VAS). This reduction in pain may be relevant since the pain would be experienced in the range of mild to moderate pain (VAS). Including 30 patients per group (a total of 120) compensated for dropout.

Study site and population

The study population will be recruited from the Birth Suites of two major maternity hospitals. Women eligible for the study are those that request analgesia for continuous severe lower back pain during labour (≥ 7 on the VAS) and provide informed consent. The categorisation of severe back pain as ≥ 7 on the VAS has been previously validated and consistent with defined inclusion criteria in previous SWI studies. Women with a baseline VAS score of < 7 were more likely to find administration of the procedure unacceptable.

The eligibility criteria are pre-specified as:

Inclusion criteria

Participants eligible for the study will be defined as:

Women at term (between 37 and 42 weeks)

Nulliparous or multiparous

Singleton pregnancy

Cephalic presentation

First stage labour (spontaneous or induced)

No previous analgesia pharmacological analgesia (nitrous oxide inhalation, narcotics)

Back pain assessed by VAS as ≥ 7

Ability to give informed consent. This may exclude women of non-English speaking backgrounds, where an interpreter is unavailable, and those women whose consent is required to be provided by a parent or guardian.

Exclusion criteria

Gestation < 37 weeks

Multiple pregnancy

Malpresentation (Breech Transverse etc.)

Second stage labour

Pharmacological analgesia prior to SWI

Back pain assessed by VAS < 7

Women whose labour would be considered high risk.

Strength and limitations

The study had several strengths. The trial was conducted according to a registered protocol, and only one woman discontinued participation. A number of control groups were used to explore the various combinations of EMLA versus SWI and NaCl. Limitations of the study involve the inability to blind the administration of the EMLA and placebo patches and the water and NaCl injections. The participants were unaware of the group to which they were randomized. However, there is a distinct difference regarding the pain experience between the injections of sterile water versus NaCl, which could have alerted the women of group allocation.

In the event that women experience no relief from the single injection and request the four injection technique, these women will remain within the study, and the data will be analysed according to ITT and per protocol principles.

Women requesting a repeat injection will receive the standard four injection technique. A pre-injection VAS score will be sought prior to administration and post injection VAS score will be collected at 30 minutes. These will be reported separately.

Confidentiality and data security

The data is de-identified, coded and entered onto a password protected database.

Data safety monitoring board

A Data Safety Monitoring Board has not been established for this trial. As there have been no adverse events reported in any previous trial on the topic, the trial was considered to be low risk. However, a senior obstetrician at both sites has agreed to act as a clinical monitor to investigate any adverse events that may be associated with the trial. This process has been approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee at each site.

Project management

Project management will be overseen by the research team that consists of midwifery and obstetric clinicians, midwifery academics and researchers from both sites. The research team will meet regularly during the projects development phase and regular contact and progress reports maintained via email during the recruitment phase of the trial.

### Ultrasound-guided nerve hydrodissection for pain management: rationale, methods, current literature, and theoretical mechanisms [^114RCCY5]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Nerve hydrodissection (HD), a technique used when treating nerve entrapments, involves the injection of an anesthetic, saline, or 5% dextrose in water to separate the nerve from the surrounding tissue, fascia, or adjacent structures. Animal models suggest the potential for minimal compression to initiate and perpetuate neuropathic pain. Mechanical benefits of HD may relate to release of nervi nervorum or vasa nervorum compression. Pathologic nerves can be identified by examination or ultrasound visualization. The in-plane technique is the predominant and safest method for nerve HD. Five percent dextrose may be favored as the preferred injectate based on preliminary comparative-injectate literature, but additional research is critical. Literature-based hypotheses for a direct ameliorative effect of dextrose HD on neuropathic pain are presented.

### Prolotherapy at multifidus muscle versus mechanical needling and sterile water injection in lumbar spinal stenosis [^114nBy59]. Journal of Pain Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Study Limitation and Implication

This was a retrospective examination of data from a single institution and an experienced injector, resulting in a potentially biased sample and restricted generalizability. However, the VAS measures outcomes comparable to Areerat Suputtitada, for her innovation of mechanical needling and sterile water injection. Under ultrasound guidance, a needle must be inserted precisely to remove calcification and fibrosis from the facet joints, the medial branch, and the multifidus muscles. In addition, mechanical removal of calcification and fibrosis near the neurovascular bundle in these regions requires extreme caution.

USG mechanical needling with sterile water injections can provide at least six months of pain relief. Reduced sensitization, resulting in analgesia, the elimination of calcification, and the reduction of fibrosis are all plausible mechanisms that promote joint and nerve regeneration via vasculature and joint gliding. Since no chemicals or pharmaceuticals are employed, the method is both cost-effective and extremely safe. Conversely, any pharmacological injection could be utilized in the future to aid in more joint regeneration. However, it requires exceptional skill and vigilance. Prolotherapy with D5W of the multifidus muscle carries fewer risks, making it the more practical option despite the fact that it requires multiple injections every three months and is less effective. Long-term exposure, typically to D5W used in prolotherapy, is another area that requires investigation. In addition, calcification and fibrosis continue to exist as a result of degenerative joint diseases. It will be challenging to inject regenerative agents in the future.

### A randomised non-inferiority controlled trial of a single versus a four intradermal sterile water injection technique for relief of continuous lower back pain during labour [^116uTPKM]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2011). Low credibility.

Methods/design

A randomised, controlled, non-inferiority design was considered most appropriate method to answer our stated aim. Where two treatments, have both previously been shown to be superior to a placebo, and/or in cases where the use of a placebo may be unethical or impractical, a non inferiority design can be used to determine if one treatment is "no worse" than the other. Usually, as in this study, the interventions include a new treatment and an active comparator, or a treatment currently in use. In relation to this trial, the single injection is the new treatment and the four injection technique is the active comparator. The null hypothesis is not proven if the measured effects of the two treatments lie within a specified non-inferiority margin.

Hypothesis

The null hypothesis is conventionally stated in an RCT which assumes that there is no difference between the intervention group and controls. The null hypothesis places the onus on the intervention to be proven. The null hypothesis is accepted if it cannot be refuted at the a priori defined level of significance. However, a non-inferiority design is attempting to show that two active treatments are similar in effect. Therefore, the null hypothesis cannot be rejected if the measured treatment effects lie within a pre-specified non-inferiority margin. Within non-inferiority design the sample size must be robust enough to test the quantitative or clinically relevant margin or definition of non-inferiority. This margin is informed by considerations of clinically relevance, with any treatment differences falling outside this range indicating that any dissimilarity between treatments is unacceptably large.

The predefined non-inferiority margin for the present study was defined by the minimal clinically (i.e. not statistically) significant difference in the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) to measure self-reported pain. Therefore, the null hypothesis (H 0) would be "treatment is inferior", the alternative hypothesis (H A) "treatment is non-inferior":

H 0: Difference between the four injection intradermal SWI and single injection intradermal SWI is ≥ 1 cm on the 10 cm VAS

H A: Difference between the four injection intradermal SWI and single injection intradermal SWI is < 1 cm on the 10 cm VAS

### Insertion of intradermal needles into painful points provides analgesia for intractable abdominal scar pain [^116HMgc4]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Conventional treatments are often ineffective for patients having painful abdominal scars. There are painful points in and around scar tissue. We tested the hypothesis that insertion of intradermal needles into these painful points reduces scar pain.

Methods

Patients with abdominal scar pain with painful points that is not relieved by conventional treatments were allocated to a treatment group (n = 23), a sham-treatment group (n = 23), or a control group (n = 24). In the treatment group, intradermal needles were inserted into painful points detected by a pressure threshold meter (pain ≤ 2.5 kg/cm(2)). In the sham-treatment group, the same needles were inserted into nonpainful points. The needles were kept in place for 24 hours. This process was repeated 20 times over a 4-week period. Responses were evaluated before and at the end of treatment, and 4 and 26 weeks after the treatment. Continuous and lancinating pain was evaluated on a 10-cm visual analog scale. We measured the area of pain and the pressure required to initiate painful-point pain. All patients took diclofenac as needed and completed a diary of daily diclofenac consumption.

Results

Patients in the treatment group showed a marked reduction in all pain parameters (> 70%). In contrast, analgesia was minimal in the other groups. The decreases in the pain threshold pressure correlated with the decreases in continuous and lancinating pain (r = .57 and r = .63, respectively).

Conclusion

Our data suggest that insertion of intradermal needles into painful points is a remarkably effective treatment for intractable abdominal scar pain. Analgesia presumably results from inactivation of painful points, through a yet to be elucidated mechanism.

### Analgesic effects of peripherally administered opioids in clinical models of acute and chronic inflammation [^117WXUoz]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2001). Low credibility.

A series of double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials demonstrated that low doses of morphine (0.4, 1.2, and 3.6 mg) administered into the intraligamentary space of a chronically inflamed hyperalgesic tooth produced a dose-related naloxone-reversible analgesia. This analgesic effect is mediated by a local mechanism in the inflamed tissue, because subcutaneous administration of a 1.2 mg dose of morphine failed to elicit an analgesic response. In contrast, submucosal administration of 1.2 mg morphine or 50 microg fentanyl to the site of extraction of an impacted third molar after the onset of acute pain failed to elicit an analgesic response despite demonstration of a sensitive bioassay. These data indicate that peripheral opioid analgesia can be evoked in a model of chronic, but not acute, inflammatory pain, suggesting a temporal dependent mechanism needed for the expression of peripheral opiate analgesia during inflammation in humans.

### Analgesic effects of sterile water injection in the management of low back pain during labor: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1111BzxQ]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Sterile water injections (SWIs) as a non-pharmacologic and cost-effective method have been adopted to relieve low back labor pain (LBLP).

Objective

To compare the efficacy of intradermal and subdermal SWIs in the treatment of LBLP.

Search Strategy

Three databases (PubMed, Cochrane Library, and ScienceDirect) were searched to find relevant articles using two terms, "labor" and "sterile water".

Selection Criteria

Studies reporting women with LBLP treated by intradermal or subdermal SWIs in the low back area were included.

Data Collection and Analysis

Mean differences with 95% confidence interval (CI) and relative risk with 95% CI were used to estimate VAS score and cesarean section rate, respectively.

Main Results

Except for 10 min, the patients in the intradermal or subdermal SWI group experienced considerable pain reduction compared with the control group for 30–45, 60, and 90 min. Directly comparing intradermal and subdermal SWI groups, the subdermal injection group had significantly better pain relief than the intradermal injection group only at 10 min after treatment.

Conclusions

Both intradermal and subdermal SWIs could reduce LBLP at 30–90 min. The subdermal SWI had significantly better LBLP relief than the intradermal injection only at 10 min after treatment.

### The effects of capsaicin cream on prostaglandin-induced allodynia [^112rrPLD]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2001). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Although intradermal injection of capsaicin produces acute pain and secondary hyperalgesia, long-term topical application of capsaicin cream has been used as a medication for pain relief in various pain conditions. We previously reported that intrathecal administration of prostaglandin (PG) E(2) and PGF(2alpha) into mice induced touch-evoked pain (allodynia) through capsaicin-sensitive and capsaicin-insensitive afferent fibers, respectively. To clarify the mechanism of an analgesic effect by capsaicin cream, here we applied it to the tail and hind paws of mice and investigated its effects on PGE(2)- and PGF(2alpha)-induced allodynia. Twenty-four-hour pretreatment of mice with 0.025% or 0.05% capsaicin cream markedly alleviated allodynia induced by PGE(2), but not by PGF(2alpha). These results suggest that the topical application of capsaicin cream modulates capsaicin-sensitive afferents and ameliorates allodynia evoked by PGE(2) at the spinal level.

Implications

Topical application of capsaicin cream alleviates touch-evoked pain induced by the intrathecal administration of prostaglandin E(2). This study may provide a rationale for the use of capsaicin cream as a therapeutic drug for pain relief.

### Western water hemp [^114qaDno]. FDA (2009). Low credibility.

Injections should never be given intravenously. A 5/8 inch, 25 gauge needle on a sterile syringe will allow deep subcutaneous injection.

IMMUNOTHERAPY: If the first injection of the initial dilution of extract is tolerated without significant local reaction, increasing doses by 5–20% increments of that dilution may be administered. The rate of increase in dosage in the early stages of treatment with highly diluted extracts is usually more rapid than the rate of increase possible with more concentrated extracts. This schedule is intended only as a guide and must be modified according to the reactivity of the individual patient. Needless to say, the physician must proceed cautiously in the treatment of the highly sensitive patient who develops large local or systemic reactions .6

Some patients may tolerate larger doses of the allergenic extract depending on patient response.7Because diluted extract tends to lose activity in storage, the first dose from a more concentrated vial should be the same, or less than, the previous dose.8, 12

Dosages progressively increase according to the tolerance of the patient at intervals of one to seven days until, (1) the patient achieves relief from symptoms, (2) induration at the site of injection is no larger than 50 mm in 36 to 48 hours, (3) a maintenance dose is reached (the largest dose tolerated by the patient that relieves symptoms without undesirable local or systemic reactions). This maintenance dose may be continued at regular intervals perennially. It may be necessary to adjust the progression of dosage downward to avoid local and constitutional reactions.

The usual duration of treatment has not been established. A period of two or three years on immunotherapy constitutes an average minimum course of treatment.

### Intradermal sterile water injection versus diclofenac sodium in acute renal colic pain: a randomized controlled trial [^116z9jis]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

We aimed to evaluate the efficacy of intracutaneous sterile water injection (ISWI) to relieve the pain of acute renal colic compared with diclofenac and placebo.

Methods

The study included 150 patients presented to the Emergency Department with renal colic randomized into 3 groups: control group received intracutaneous injections of 0.5 cm 3 isotonic saline in the flank, group A received intracutaneous injections of 0.5 cm 3 ISWI in the flank, and group B received an intramuscular injection of 75 mg Diclofenac in the gluteal region. The severity of the pain was assessed by a visual analogue scale system at baseline and 30, 45 min, and 60 min after injections. Subjects with inadequate pain relief at 1 h received rescue analgesia.

Results

The mean baseline pain score was 9.6 ± 0.61 in the ISWI group, 9.72 ± 0.64 in the diclofenac group and 9.26 ± 0.89 in the control group. The mean pain score at 30 min of the control group was reduced to 6.9 ± 1.56. This mean at 30 min after ISWI and diclofenac injections were reduced to 1.98 ± 1.41 and 1.88 ± 1.19 respectively. The mean of pain sore of the ISWI and diclofenac group at 45 and 60 min was constant. Rescue analgesics at 1 h were required by 47 patients receiving the saline injection and by 4 patients and by 7 patients receiving ISWI and diclofenac injection respectively.

Conclusions

ISWI and diclofenac were equally effective for the pain relief of acute renal colic.

### Impact on caesarean section rates following injections of sterile water (ICARIS): a multicentre randomised controlled trial [^1159Zz4B]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2013). Low credibility.

Sterile water injections as pain relief for lower back pain in labour

Sterile water injections (SWI) into the lower back can provide pain relief to women experiencing lower back pain during labour although there is still uncertainty about the effectiveness of this intervention on the improvement of clinical outcomes including decreased need for epidural anaesthesia or CS. A sterile water injection, administered either intradermally or subcutaneously, causes osmotic and mechanical irritation resulting in a brief (15–30 second) but significant stinging sensation that is generally well tolerated by women. The onset of pain relief follows almost immediately in the majority of women and can last for up to two hours. The procedure can be repeated a number of times. The method has been described as inexpensive to use and the injection technique is easy to learn.

### Caesarean delivery rates and analgesia effectiveness following injections of sterile water for back pain in labour: a multicentre, randomised placebo controlled trial [^116GofjT]. EClinicalMedicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Maternal satisfaction with analgesic effect of SWI was assessed in four domains. Surveys were returned by 70% (407/580) of women in the SWI group and 71% (403/567) of the placebo group. More women in the SWI group than the saline placebo group replied positively regarding their experience of effectiveness in reliving back pain (p = < 0·001); overall satisfaction with the treatment (p = 0·001); would choose the treatment in a subsequent pregnancy (p = 0·05); and would recommend the treatment to other women (p = 0·001) (Table 4).

There was also no difference in rates of spontaneous (RR 0·94, 95%CI 0·86–1·04; p = 0·221) or instrumental births (RR 1·06, 95% CI 1·06 0·85–1·31; p = 617). There was no difference in other secondary labour and birth complications (Table 2). Neonatal outcomes including Apgar score, neonatal resuscitation and admission to special care nurseries were not significantly different (Table 3). No adverse events related to injections of either sterile water or normal saline were noted during the trial.

Table 2
Primary and Secondary Maternal Outcomes

Table 3
Secondary Neonatal Outcomes

Prior to treatment the VAS scores (100 mm scale) for back pain between groups were 83.4 (SWI) versus 83.5 (placebo) (mean difference 0.1, 95% CI −2·3–2·2; p = 0.954). At 30 min following treatment 330 (60·8%) of 543 women in the SWI group compared to 163 (31·4%) of 520 women in the saline placebo group reported a 30% reduction in VAS scores (RR 1·94, 95% CI 1·68–2·24; p = < 0·001). In the SWI group 235 (43·3%) of 543 women reported an at least 50% reduction in VAS scores at 30 min post injection compared to 94 (18·1%) of 520 women receiving the saline placebo (RR 2·39, 95% CI 2·39 1·95–2·94; p = < 0·001). This difference in pain score reduction remained significant at 60 and 90 min (Table 2). Whilst women may use multiple combinations of pharmacological and neuraxial analgesic during labour, the overall use of conventionally available analgesia after randomization did not differ significantly between groups (Table 2). Nitrous oxide inhalation was used by 386 (66·6%) of 580 women in the SWI group and 383 (67·6%) of 567 in the saline placebo group (RR 0·99, 95% CI 0·91–1·07; p = 0·720). In the SWI group epidurals were used by 215 (37·1%) of 580 compared to 221 (39·0%) of women receiving the saline placebo (RR 0·95, 95% CI 0·82–1·10; p = 0·506).

### Hyaluronan modulates TRPV1 channel opening, reducing peripheral nociceptor activity and pain [^115k9ShK]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

HA reduced behavioural nocifensive responses to noxious heat

To determine the effect of HA on nociceptive nerve terminals in vivo, we tested the latency of the pain response of mice to the hot plate test (52 °C) after subcutaneous injection in the paw of different solutions. In animals injected with saline solution, latency was significantly lower than in animals receiving HA (Fig. 5a). The increment in latency time promoted by HA was not observed in TRPV1 null mice (Fig. 5a). Similar results were obtained with subcutaneous CAP injection in the hind paw (Supplementary Fig. 5). Hyaluronidase (Hyasa), an enzyme that digests HA of the ECM around pain nerve terminals, caused a significant reduction in latency. Notably, the injection of HA into animals previously treated with Hyasa restored latency values to normal levels (Fig. 5a). Altogether, these results supported the hypothesis that HA reduces the sensitivity of nociceptor endings to noxious stimuli transduced by TRPV1 channels.

HA inhibits CAP-evoked activity in joint nociceptor fibres

Nociceptor nerve fibres innervating the knee joint synovial membrane, express TRPV1 channels. To explore the possibility that the modulation of nerve impulse activity by HA of the synovial fluid involves TRPV1 channels, we recorded nerve impulse activity in saphenous nerve filaments of anaesthetized rats, selecting polymodal units that responded to noxious rotations of the joint and also to a close intra-arterial, bolus injection of CAP (Fig. 5b, c). In a thin nerve filament, CAP typically recruited 1–6 separate units, responding to CAP with an irregular nerve impulse discharge that started a few seconds after the onset of injection (Fig. 5c). In control experiments, in which intra-articular sterile saline solution was injected immediately after the first intra-arterial CAP injection, the number of impulses evoked by successive CAP injections decayed by a maximum of ≤ 20% of the impulse discharge produced by the first CAP injection, taken as 100% (control response, black symbols, Fig. 5d). By contrast, when HA was injected intra-articularly, the discharge evoked by serial CAP injections decayed gradually and was ≥ 60% (Fig. 5c, d). Collectively, these results confirmed that intra-articular HA significantly decreased TRPV1-mediated responsiveness of joint nociceptor fibres.

### Labor analgesia [^112isN7B]. American Family Physician (2012). Low credibility.

Regional analgesia has become the most common method of pain relief used during labor in the United States. Epidural and spinal analgesia are two types of regional analgesia. With epidural analgesia, an indwelling catheter is directed into the epidural space, and the patient receives a continuous infusion or multiple injections of local anesthetic. Spinal injections are usually single injections into the intrathecal space. A combination of epidural and spinal analgesia, known as a walking epidural, also is available. This technique combines the rapid pain relief from the spinal regional block with the constant and consistent effects from the epidural block. It allows sufficient motor function for patients to ambulate. Complications with regional analgesia are uncommon, but may include postdural puncture headache. Rare serious complications include neurologic injury, epidural hematoma, or deep epidural infection. Regional analgesia increases the risk of instrument-assisted vaginal delivery, and family physicians should understand the contraindications and risks of complications. Continuous labor support (e.g., doula), systemic opioid analgesia, pudendal blocks, water immersion, sterile water injections into the lumbosacral spine, self-taught hypnosis, and acupuncture are other options for pain management during labor.

Data collection

Upon randomisation the attending Midwife will document the following data:

- UR number

- Gravity and Parity

- Gestation

- Spontaneous or induced labour

- Findings of last vaginal exam and time

- VAS score and time

- Time of administration

Following administration of SWI the following data will be recorded:

- VAS related to analgesia effect at 10 mins

- VAS related to discomfort felt during the procedure (at 10 mins)

- VAS related to analgesic effect at 30 minute intervals up to 2 hours post procedure

At Site One the following data will be extracted from the obstetric database by the research midwife following birth:

- Age

- Booking weight & BMI

- Mode of birth

- Time of birth

- Any other analgesia used (pharmacological and non pharmacological)

- Model of care

- Educational level

The obstetric databases at Site One and Site Two vary slightly in the data items collected. As separate data collection forms have been generated for the randomisation process for Site Two, the data collection forms have been amended to account for any differences in information captured by the database.

The following self-reported data will be sought from the woman within 48 hours following birth:

- Perceived satisfaction with SWI administration

- Perceived satisfaction with SWI analgesic benefit

- Likelihood to use again with subsequent labour

- Likelihood to recommend to SWI to others

Data will be collected by the Midwife caring for the labouring woman then returned to a securely locked cupboard. Completed data forms will be de-identified and entered into a password protected electronic database. Identified data collection forms will be kept in locked storage for 15 years. Data collection forms at the second site will be stored in a locked cupboard and collected on a fortnightly basis. Data will be entered into a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet and transmitted as a password protected file

Data collection tools

The intrapartum data collection tool has been adapted from an existing document that was used as an audit tool during the introduction of SWI at Site One. For self reported postnatal data, the data collection tool previously published and used in the Australian study by Peart et al. has been made available for use. This tool has been tested for face readability, language and face validity. The instrument will be administered by a researcher blinded to the particular technique used.

### Effect of topical local anaesthesia on injection pain associated with administration of sterile water injections-a randomized controlled trial [^113vhEBU]. BMC Anesthesiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Sterile water injections can provide effective pain relief during childbirth, particularly for low back pain related to childbirth. However, the pain associated administering the injections can negatively impact women's impressions of the procedure. It may discourage women from considering repeat doses despite the quality of analgesia experienced. Determining strategies to reduce the pain related to the administration of sterile water injections would improve the acceptability of the technique. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of topical local anesthesia on the pain associated with administration of sterile water injections.

Methods

The study was designed as a multi-arm single-blind, randomized, controlled trial and 120 female healthy students were randomly divided according to one of four groups. The Intervention group received sterile water injections with topical local anesthesia. Control group 1 received sterile water injections without topical local anesthesia, control group 2 received injections of isotonic saline 0.9% with topical local anesthesia and control group 3 received injections of isotonic saline 0.9% without topical local anesthesia. Pain Immediately after the injections and subsidence in pain were recorded using a visual analogue scale. Sensations in the injection area were reported 15 min and the day after the injections.

Results

The main finding of this study was that local anesthesia with EMLA® reduces the pain associated with the administration of intracutaneous sterile water injections. There was a significant difference in the self-assessed pain score immediately following the injections between the control (73.3 mm) and intervention groups (50.0 mm), p = 0.001. No adverse side effects were reported.

Conclusion

Local anesthesia with EMLA® reduces the pain associated with intracutaneous administration of sterile water injections.

### Intradermal sterile water injection: safe and effective alternative for relief of acute renal colic in the emergency department [^111zyv25]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The optimal pain relief method for acute renal colic in the emergency department remains controversial.

Objective

We compared the safety and efficacy of intradermal sterile water injection (ISWI) to treatment with intramuscular (IM) diclofenac, intravenous (IV) opioids, and IV paracetamol in patients with acute renal colic.

Methods

This randomized, single-blind study included 320 patients with renal colic to one of four treatment groups. The first group received ISWI at four different points around the most painful flank area. Patients in the DI, PARA, and TRAM groups received 75 mg IM diclofenac, 1 g IV paracetamol, and 100 mg IV tramadol, respectively. Pain intensity was measured using a visual analog scale (VAS) before treatment and 15, 30, and 60 min after treatment.

Results

VAS scores 15 and 30 min after treatment were significantly lower in group ISWI than in groups DI, PARA, and TRAM. However, there were no significant differences in the decrease in the pain score at baseline and at 60 min after treatment. In addition, fewer patients required rescue analgesia in group ISWI than in group TRAM. However, no significant differences were observed between group ISWI and group DI or PARA in terms of the need for rescue analgesia. Finally, there were significantly fewer adverse events in group ISWI than in groups DI and TRAM.

Conclusions

ISWI had similar efficacy, faster pain relief, and lower need for rescue analgesia compared with diclofenac, paracetamol, and tramadol for the management of acute renal colic. In addition, ISWI was well-tolerated and had no adverse effects.

### Comparison of intradermal sterile water injection and dexketoprofen trometamol in pain management of renal colic patients [^1147HBmp]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Aim

In our study, we planned to investigate the efficacy of intradermal sterile water injections (ISWI) in the pain management of patients admitted to the emergency department due to renal colic. We also aimed to investigate patient satisfaction and reduce the use of opioid drugs with this method.

Patients and Methods

A randomized controlled trial was conducted with 100 patients who presented with renal colic. Patients were divided into two groups: Group 1 received 50 mg of intravenous dexketoprofen trometamol, while Group 2 received dexketoprofen trometamol along with ISWI administered to four predetermined dermatomes (T11-L4). Pain levels were assessed using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) at baseline and at 5, 10, 15, and 30 min post-treatment. Rescue analgesia requirements were also recorded. The primary outcome was the change in VAS pain score from baseline to 30 min after treatment.

Findings

ISWI combined with dexketoprofen trometamol significantly reduced VAS scores compared to dexketoprofen trometamol alone (p < 0.05). The study was not registered, and the outcome assessment was not blinded. CONSORT methodology was not fully followed. These limitations need to be considered when interpreting the results.

Conclusion

The combination of ISWI and dexketoprofen trometamol provides superior pain relief and reduces the need for rescue analgesia in patients with renal colic compared to dexketoprofen trometamol alone. However, because of the limitations mentioned above, no definitive conclusions can be drawn from this study.

### Effect of topical local anaesthesia on injection pain associated with administration of sterile water injections-a randomized controlled trial [^111zUrM1]. BMC Anesthesiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Most women in childbirth experience intense pain. This kind of pain can affect the women's experience of childbirth negatively for up to 1 year postnatally. The pain may even result in symptoms of post-traumatic stress. Safe and effective pain relief should therefore be available for all women. However, many women are reluctant or hesitant to accept pharmacological pain relief out of concern for possible adverse side effects on themselves or their unborn baby. Since the mid-1980s, sterile water injections (SWI) have been used to alleviate low back pain during childbirth. In addition to treatment for childbirth pain, SWI has been used to relieve chronic neck pain, renal colic and ureterolithiasis during pregnancy.

Along with several smaller studies, a large double-blind, randomized controlled trial successfully demonstrated that SWI could provide effectively relief for low back pain during childbirth. Clinical guidelines for the use of the procedure have earlier been published. Previously it has been reported that the pain associated with administering the injections can negatively impact women's experiences. It has also been reported that women rated the injection pain as more painful than labor contractions. Further, midwives have reported reluctance to recommend this treatment due to the pain inflicted during the administration of the injections.

SWI is a simple and inexpensive method involving the injection of small volumes of sterile water intracutaneously (0.1 ml) or subcutaneously (0.5 ml) at the site/s at which the woman perceives pain, Fig. 1. The most common technique entails the administration of four injections, but three studies demonstrated a good effect after just one injection. Whether pain relief is influenced by the number of injections or the volume of sterile water per injection has been discussed. However, Lee et al. found that four injections resulted in better pain relief effect than one injection. Pain relief usually occurs within a few minutes and can be repeated if needed. The only observed disadvantage of SWI is the injection pain. The pain can be described as similar to a bee or wasp sting, with a duration of approximately 20–30 s. In an earlier cross-over study including 100 non-pregnant healthy women reported that the injection pain was considerably reduced if the injections were administered subcutaneously using a somewhat more substantial volume of sterile water.

In addition to clear reporting of preparation and administration, future studies should continue to elucidate the true mechanism of action that may lead to analgesia and improve functionality with injectable biologics. Studies should also investigate if biologics derived from their source need to have certain properties that are superior to their original tissue sources before injection, such as specific stimuli from the wound environment that may stimulate MSCs to secrete anti-inflammatory factors. Further, studies are warranted on creation of "universal MSCs" that may function equally regardless of origin, and outcomes based on autologous versus allogeneic biologic injectate.

### Effect of topical local anaesthesia on injection pain associated with administration of sterile water injections-a randomized controlled trial [^111v3eJb]. BMC Anesthesiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Despite that SWI has been proven to be a highly effective pain relief method, without any adverse side effects, some women are doubtful of the method. Earlier it has been reported that some women rated the injection pain as more painful than the contraction pain with a self-reported VAS of 90–100 mm. The reduction of perceived pain related to the injections in the present study may mean that laboring women are more likely to use this pain relief method. Furthermore, it has been reported that midwives find it counter-intuitive to cause women additional pain when using SWI to relieve childbirth pain. However, it may be more likely that midwives would recommend SWI if using an EMLA patch before treatment.

As this study aimed to establish if the use of topical anesthetic creams could reduce the pain of SWI and non-pregnant women were included as participants, there remain two essential questions that this trial was not designed to address. Firstly, as the EMLA cream takes 60–90 min to achieve an effect, would this delay in providing analgesia be acceptable to women? A woman in childbirth would, not unsurprisingly, want pain relief directly after providing her informed decision about the analgesic method for her labor pain. The delay in the effect of the EMLA and similar topical anesthetics could be too long to wait for the woman. An alternative may be to apply the EMLA patches early if the woman considers SWI a treatment for back pain, as the patches can be left in place for up to 5 h. Secondly, would the reduction in injection pain negatively impact the resulting analgesia? No studies have directly explored the relationship between injection pain and the degree of resulting analgesia. Previous studies have determined that single water injection is given at the point on the back where the woman perceives her pain to be most substantial results in a significant pain reduction. However, the pain of the injection was not reported. One trial compared a single to four injections and found that the single injection was significantly less painful than four and resulted in a significantly reduced analgesic effect. However, women were still quite satisfied with the analgesia provided by the one injection. This suggests there may be a tradeoff between a more acceptable level of pain and a reduced but still effective degree of analgesia.

### Caesarean delivery rates and analgesia effectiveness following injections of sterile water for back pain in labour: a multicentre, randomised placebo controlled trial [^117JJhta]. EClinicalMedicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

About a third of women experience severe back pain during labour. Injecting small volumes of intracutaneous sterile water into the lumbar region can be used to relieve this pain, however the procedure is controversial and previous reviews call for high quality trials to establish efficacy. We evaluated the impact on birth outcomes and analgesic effects of sterile water injections.

Methods

A multicentre, double-blind trial undertaken between December 2012 and December 2017 in one British and 15 Australian maternity units. Women experiencing severe back-pain in labour were assigned (1:1) by an independently generated randomisation schedule stratified by site to injections of either sterile water or saline placebo. Participants and caregivers were blinded to group allocation. The primary outcome was caesarean delivery rate. Main secondary outcomes included at least 30% or 50% reduction in self-reported pain scores at 30, 60 and 90 minutes after treatment. Intention to treat analysis were used and the level of significance for the multiple clinical outcomes was set at p < 0.001 with the Bonferroni correction applied. The study is registered with the ACTRN Registry number, ACTRN1261100022195

Findings

Between December 9, 2012, and December 15, 2017, 1166 women were recruited and randomised: 587 women received sterile water injections (SWI) and 579 a saline placebo. Seven women in the SWI group and 12 in the placebo group were excluded as consent was not completed, leaving 580 and 567, respectively, included in the analysis. The proportions of caesarean delivery were 17·1% (82 of 580) in the SWI group and 14·8% (82 of 567) in the placebo (RR 1·16, 95% CI 0·88–1.51; p = 0·293). At 30 min post treatment 60·8% (330 of 543) of women in the SWI group reported a 30% reduction in self-reported pain compared to 31·4% (163 of 520) placebo (RR 1·94, 95% CI 1·68–2·24; p = < 0·001) and 43·3% (235 of 534) SWI reported a 50% reduction versus 18·1% (94 of 520) placebo (RR 2·39, 95% CI 1·95–2·94; p = < 0·001). The analgesic effect of SWI compared to placebo remained significant at 60 and 90 min post-treatment. There were no significant differences in other maternal or neonatal outcomes.

Interpretation

Compared to placebo, injections of sterile water did not reduce rates of caesarean delivery. For the main secondary outcome of pain relief the intervention did result in significantly more women reporting at least 30% and 50% reduction in pain for up to 90 min. Water injections have no effect on birth outcomes though can be an effective treatment for the relief of labour-related back pain.

### Betamethasone sodium phosphate and betamethasone acetate [^111q7cx8]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Rheumatoid Arthritis and Osteoarthritis

Following intra-articular administration of 0.5 to 2 mL of Betamethasone Sodium Phosphate and Betamethasone Acetate Injectable Suspension, relief of pain, soreness, and stiffness may be experienced. Duration of relief varies widely in both diseases. Intra-articular Injection of Betamethasone Sodium Phosphate and Betamethasone Acetate Injectable Suspension is well tolerated in joints and periarticular tissues. There is virtually no pain on injection, and the "secondary flare" that sometimes occurs a few hours after intra-articular injection of corticosteroids has not been reported with Betamethasone Sodium Phosphate and Betamethasone Acetate Injectable Suspension. Using sterile technique, a 20- to 24-gauge needle on an empty syringe is inserted into the synovial cavity and a few drops of synovial fluid are withdrawn to confirm that the needle is in the joint. The aspirating syringe is replaced by a syringe containing Betamethasone Sodium Phosphate and Betamethasone Acetate Injectable Suspension and injection is then made into the joint.

A portion of the administered dose of Betamethasone Sodium Phosphate and Betamethasone Acetate Injectable Suspension is absorbed systemically following intra-articular injection. In patients being treated concomitantly with oral or parenteral corticosteroids, especially those receiving large doses, the systemic absorption of the drug should be considered in determining intra-articular dosage.

Dermatologic Conditions

In intralesional treatment, 0.2 mL/cm2of Betamethasone Sodium Phosphate and Betamethasone Acetate Injectable Suspension is injected intradermally (not subcutaneously) using a tuberculin syringe with a 25-gauge, 1/2-inch needle. Care should be taken to deposit a uniform depot of medication intradermally. A total of no more than 1 mL at weekly intervals is recommended.

Disorders of the Foot

A tuberculin syringe with a 25-gauge, 3/4-inch needle is suitable for most injections into the foot. The following doses are recommended at intervals of 3 days to a week.

central nervous system and gastrointestinal tract. Its primary action of therapeutic value is analgesia. The analgesic effects of hydromorphone are due to its central action; however, the precise mechanism of action of hydromorphone and other opiates is not 17 19 3. known, although it is believed to relate to the existence of opiate receptors in the central nervous system. Hydromorphone, like other narcotic analgesics, appears to increase the patient's tolerance for pain and to decrease the perception of suffering, although the presence of the pain itself may still be recognized. Narcotic analgesics cause histamine release, which appears to be responsible for wheals or urticaria sometimes seen at the site of injection. Histamine release may also produce dilation of cutaneous blood vessels, with resultant flushing of the face and neck, pruritus and sweating. Hydromorphone is well absorbed after parenteral administration.

After intramuscular administration, hydromorphone has a slightly more rapid onset and slightly shorter duration of analgesia than morphine. The major pathway of hydromorphone metabolism is conjugation with glucuronic acid in the liver; hydromorphone glucuronide is excreted primarily in the urine. INDICATIONS AND USAGE Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection is indicated for the relief of moderate to severe pain such as that due to: surgery, cancer, trauma, biliary colic, myocardial infarction, burns, renal colic. Hydromorphone should not be administered intravenously unless a narcotic antagonist and the facilities for resuscitation and assisted or controlled respiration are immediately. OTHER: Opiate-induced histamine release may be responsible for the flushing of the face, sweating and pruritus often seen with these drugs. Wheals and urticaria at the site of injection are probably related to histamine release.

Local tissue irritation, pain and induration have been reported following repeated subcutaneous injection. supportive, including maintenance of proper fluid and electrolyte balance. Tolerance, in which increasingly large doses are required in order to produce the same degree of analgesia, is manifested initially by a shortened duration of analgesic effect and subsequently by decreases in the intensity of analgesia. The rate of development of tolerance varies among patients.

### Effect of topical local anaesthesia on injection pain associated with administration of sterile water injections-a randomized controlled trial [^112JnxgT]. BMC Anesthesiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Sterile water injections can provide effective pain relief during childbirth, particularly for low back pain related to childbirth. However, the pain associated administering the injections can negatively impact women's impressions of the procedure. It may discourage women from considering repeat doses despite the quality of analgesia experienced. Determining strategies to reduce the pain related to the administration of sterile water injections would improve the acceptability of the technique. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of topical local anesthesia on the pain associated with administration of sterile water injections.

Methods

The study was designed as a multi-arm single-blind, randomized, controlled trial and 120 female healthy students were randomly divided according to one of four groups. The Intervention group received sterile water injections with topical local anesthesia. Control group 1 received sterile water injections without topical local anesthesia, control group 2 received injections of isotonic saline 0.9% with topical local anesthesia and control group 3 received injections of isotonic saline 0.9% without topical local anesthesia. Pain Immediately after the injections and subsidence in pain were recorded using a visual analogue scale. Sensations in the injection area were reported 15min and the day after the injections.

Results

The main finding of this study was that local anesthesia with EMLA® reduces the pain associated with the administration of intracutaneous sterile water injections. There was a significant difference in the self-assessed pain score immediately following the injections between the control (73.3mm) and intervention groups (50.0mm), p = 0.001. No adverse side effects were reported.

Conclusion

Local anesthesia with EMLA® reduces the pain associated with intracutaneous administration of sterile water injections.

Trial Registration

The study was registered 08/07/2014 at ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02213185.

### Complementary and alternative medicine in obstetrics [^115Bjz8N]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To identify, survey and review randomized controlled studies of the use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) for obstetric treatment or health promotion.

Methods

The MEDLINE database was searched to identify randomized controlled trials of CAM treatment and therapies in obstetrics. Studies examining modalities for treatment or improvement of health status were reviewed.

Results

Fifty-four articles assessing a variety of health modalities met the criteria for inclusion. Acupressure and ginger for prenatal nausea and vomiting, moxibustion for version of breech presentation, sterile water injections for back pain relief in labor, and perineal massage to prevent perineal trauma have three or more studies demonstrating beneficial effect. Other interventions have been studied less, and evidence for them is limited.

Conclusions

Some CAM interventions have evidence of effectiveness for use in obstetric patients, while others require further investigation before they can be considered for use in practice.

### Effect of topical local anaesthesia on injection pain associated with administration of sterile water injections-a randomized controlled trial [^112A26ex]. BMC Anesthesiology (2022). Medium credibility.

It is essential, for several reasons, to develop safe and effective non-pharmacological pain relief methods offered to women during childbirth. Many women wish to avoid methods that use drugs because of known or unknown side effects for the mother and the unborn baby. It is also essential to identify techniques that provide minimal side effects and discomfort with the highest possible pain relief. SWI has been shown to provide adequate relief of back pain in labor, however, the associated injection pain acts as a deterrent to widespread use. As the study was conducted on non-pregnant women, it is not known if reducing the injection pain will impact the degree or duration of analgesia usually associated with SWI. The next step is, therefore, to evaluate if the pain relief effect for childbirth back pain remains after local anesthesia of the skin before treatment with intracutaneous sterile water injections. The method might also be an option for women in parts of the world where there is limited access to pain relief methods during childbirth. The reduction in injection pain found in this trial may increase the utility of SWI as an option for other severe pain conditions such as ureterolithiasis or other different kinds of chronic pain.

### A randomised non-inferiority controlled trial of a single versus a four intradermal sterile water injection technique for relief of continuous lower back pain during labour [^112GtinE]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2011). Low credibility.

There may be important clinical benefits in demonstrating the comparable analgesic efficacy of a single versus four needle SWI technique. The relative reduction in discomfort associated with the single injection procedure may increase the woman's satisfaction and acceptability with SWI treatment during labour, and willingness to use the procedure again in the future. In addition, improved resource allocation can be expected as only one midwife is required to administer a single SWI compared with the current recommendation for two midwives to administer the four injection technique. Therefore, the aim of this study is to compare a single intradermal SWI technique with the standard four injection intradermal technique in the degree and duration of analgesic benefit.

### P-care K80MX… [^114pUp1T]. FDA (DailyMed) (2020). Medium credibility.

Kenalog-40 Injection and Kenalog-80 Injection have an extended duration of effect which may be sustained over a period of several weeks. Studies indicate that following a single intramuscular dose of 60 mg to 100 mg of triamcinolone acetonide, adrenal suppression occurs within 24 to 48 hours and then gradually returns to normal, usually in 30 to 40 days. This finding correlates closely with the extended duration of therapeutic action achieved with the drug. Intramuscular Where oral therapy is not feasible, injectable corticosteroid therapy, including Kenalog-40 Injection and Kenalog-80 Injection are indicated for intramuscular use as follows: Allergic states: Control of severe or incapacitating allergic conditions intractable to adequate trials of conventional treatment in asthma, atopic dermatitis, contact dermatitis, drug hypersensitivity reactions, perennial or seasonal allergic rhinitis, serum sickness, transfusion reactions.

Intra-Articular The intra-articular or soft tis sue administration of Kenalog-40 Injection and Kenalog-80 Injection are indicated as adjunctive therapy for short-term administration in acute gouty arthritis, acute and subacute bursitis, acute nonspecific. Unless a deep intramuscular injection is given, local atrophy is likely to occur. Due to the significantly higher incidence of local atrophy when the material is injected into the deltoid area, this injection site should be avoided in favor of the gluteal area. Intraocular injection of corticosteroid formulations containing benzyl alcohol, such as Kenalog-40 Injection, is not recommended because of potential toxicity from the benzyl alcohol. General This product, like many other steroid formulations, is sensitive to heat.

Therefore, it should not be autoclaved when it is desirable to sterilize the exterior of the vial. There is an enhanced effect of corticosteroids in patients with cirrhosis. Intra-Articular and Soft Tissue Administration Intra-articularly injected corticosteroids may be systemically absorbed. Appropriate examination of any joint fluid present is necessary to exclude a septic process. A marked increase in pain accompanied by local swelling, further restriction of joint motion, fever, and malaise are suggestive of septic arthritis. If this complication occurs and the diagnosis of sepsis is confirmed, appropriate antimicrobial therapy should be instituted.

### Effect of topical local anaesthesia on injection pain associated with administration of sterile water injections-a randomized controlled trial [^111HNxL9]. BMC Anesthesiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Results

A total of 120 female students participated in the study. For unknown reasons, one woman discontinued the participation. In total, 119 women were included in the analysis. The recruitment and flow chart of the study is presented in Fig. 2. There were no differences between the SWI groups or NaCl groups, nor between all four groups regarding socio-demographic variables (age; body mass index; knowledge of SWI; previous childbirth; anxiety for pain and use of tobacco), Table 1.

There was a statistically significant difference regarding perceived pain of 23.3 mm on VAS, 1–3 s after the injections of sterile water were given, between the intervention group (EMLA SWI) and control group 1 (placebo SWI) (50.0 vs 73.3, p = 0.001). This statistically significant difference does not remain 30 s after the injections. However, in both groups, the perceived pain has decreased, during the time of observation, Fig. 3 and Table 2. This trend was noted in the intervention group (EMLA and SWI) but did not achieve a statistically significant difference compared to control group 1 (placebo and SWI). Further, immediately after the injections were given (1–3 s), 30% (n = 9) scored severe pain in the EMLA SWI group. The corresponding figure for the placebo SWI group was 63.3% (n = 19), (P = 0.00634).

Statistical analysis

Demographic and other baseline characteristics will be analysed for comparability between groups to assess the adequacy of randomisation. Differences in VAS pain score between the two groups will be analysed using Student's t-test and analysis of variance (non-parametric tests used if data is highly clustered toward extremes). Data analysis for the primary outcome will determine if the treatment effect lies within the a priori defined non-inferiority margin (± 1 cm) and the null effect (0 cm) at a one-sided alpha of 0.025. The pre-specified non-inferiority margin was based on a one cm (95% CI 0.6–1.4 cm) minimally clinically significant difference reported for VAS in severe pain. The Mann-Whitney U test will be utilised for non-parametric data and chi-squared test for categorical variables. Women who give birth or elect for narcotic and/or regional analgesia after the collection of the primary measure (VAS score 30 minutes post injection) but before the completion of the secondary outcomes (VAS up to 120 mins) will be included in the trial. Women giving birth or electing for narcotic and/or regional anaesthesia prior to the collection of the primary outcome measure will be included in the Intention to Treat (ITT) analysis. The conservative nature of ITT may obscure differences between treatments groups therefore increasing the chance of falsely declaring equivalence. To address this, some authors have recommended that Per Protocol (PP) analysis also be conducted alongside ITT to provide a more robust conclusion if both methods support the non-inferiority. Other authors argue that the benefits of ITT analysis continue to outweigh the PP approach. As it is unlikely that participants in this trial will cross from one intervention to another, the ITT approach will be used unless the dropout out rate exceeds the estimated margin allowed of 20%. Should the dropout rate exceed 20% then a PP analysis will also be conducted. Figure 4 outlines possible scenarios for the outcome of the data analysis based on the pre-defined noninferiority margin, indicated as the shaded area. Error bars indicate 90% confidence intervals (CI). If the CI is completely to the left of zero, the treatment is inferior (scenario A). Scenarios C, D and E indicate noninferiority as the CI lies within the specified margin (shaded area). Scenario F would indicate superiority. An inconclusive result (scenario B) is unlikely as the sample size is sufficiently powered to provide a result.

Interventions

Control group

Participants randomised to the control group will be given SWI using the standard four injection intradermal technique into the skin surrounding the Michaelis rhomboid over the sacral area. Anatomically, the injections will be administered: two over each posterior superior iliac spine (PSIS) and two three cm below and one cm medial to the PSIS (Figure 1). Minor discrepancies or changes to the anatomical position or alignment of the four injections have not been shown to impact on any analgesic effect.

Figure 1
The four injection technique.

Intervention group

Participants randomised to the intervention group will be given SWI using the single injection intradermal technique.

The anatomical site for the single injection will be over the single most painful point as indicated by the woman (Figure 2).

Figure 2
The single injection technique. Woman indicates the most painful point or central to the most painful area.

Primary outcome

Decrease in pain measured by VAS at 30 minutes post-intervention.

Secondary outcomes

Secondary outcomes will include:

a) Pain score measured by VAS 10, 60, 90 and 120 mins post-intervention

b) Level of administration discomfort associated with SWI procedure (measured by VAS at 10 minutes post SWI)

c) Subsequent analgesia use (pharmacological and non-pharmacological)

d) Mode of birth

e) Likelihood to use again with subsequent labour

f) Patient satisfaction with analgesic effect

Sample size

A sample size of 133 in each group will be required to achieve 90% power to detect non-inferiority using a one-sided, two-sample t-test. The significance (alpha) of the test is 0.025. The non-inferiority margin is ≤ 1 cm on the VAS and the true difference between the means is assumed to be zero (cms). A standard deviation (SD) of ± 2.5 on the VAS was conservatively estimated from results reported in a recent meta-analysis of SWI studies. As consent and randomisation will occur in the birth suite, attrition is expected to be minimal. However, we have estimated a 20% attrition to account for cases of precipitate birth prior to the assessment of the primary outcome, or other unforseen reasons for withdrawal such as emergency caesarean section. Thus a total of 319 participants will be required.
