## Question

What medication should I add for this patient and at what dose? Or should I increase the dose of Jardiance?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which medication to add for this patient and at what dose, or whether to increase empagliflozin (Jardiance) from 10 mg to 25 mg. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and whether the current 10 mg dose is already at the trial-proven dose for cardiorenal benefit. Then, I should verify the pharmacologic rationale for 10 mg versus 25 mg and whether higher dosing adds outcome benefit. Next, I will review guideline recommendations on dose titration for SGLT2 inhibitors. After that, I should consider patient-specific factors such as renal function, volume status, and concomitant diuretics. Finally, I will outline a practical recommendation and monitoring plan, including what to do if glycemic control remains suboptimal despite optimized SGLT2 therapy [^115JdpUi] [^112DEkFy] [^111YPr6n].

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and the evidence-based dose. Empagliflozin 10 mg once daily is the dose used in the cardiovascular and renal outcome trials and is the labeled dose for T2DM with CVD, for heart failure, and for CKD; importantly, both the 10 mg and 25 mg doses showed equivalent cardiovascular and renal benefits in EMPA-REG OUTCOME, so the outcome advantage is already captured at 10 mg, and there is no additional cardiorenal benefit from increasing to 25 mg [^1112eymH] [^114mT4Uw] [^112AgNGU] [^116NhdTb].

> Wait, let me verify the pharmacologic rationale before concluding. Urinary glucose excretion plateaus around 10 mg, with only modest incremental glycemic effect at 25 mg; this supports that most of the cardiorenal and glycemic effects are realized at 10 mg, and higher dosing primarily adds more glycemic lowering without improving hard cardiovascular or renal outcomes, which aligns with the trial data showing equivalent clinical benefits at both doses [^111Hwgtn] [^116NhdTb].

> I should confirm guideline direction on titration. Expert consensus pathways explicitly recommend initiating SGLT2 inhibitors at the trial-tested dose (10 mg for empagliflozin) and not titrating for cardiovascular or renal risk reduction; dose escalation is not advised to enhance cardiorenal benefit, reinforcing that staying at 10 mg is appropriate for outcome-driven therapy [^115JdpUi] [^112DEkFy].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about glycemic control. If the primary problem is inadequate A1c lowering, I need to check whether the patient is at or near glycemic goal; if A1c remains above goal and the patient is tolerating 10 mg, increasing to 25 mg can provide an additional modest A1c reduction of roughly 0.1–0.2% on average, but I should balance this against a higher risk of genital mycotic infections and consider alternative add-on therapy with complementary mechanisms instead of simply up-titrating empagliflozin [^111zazhE] [^114joB4A] [^111YPr6n].

> Next, I should review patient-specific factors that could change the decision. I need to ensure eGFR is adequate because while empagliflozin has benefits down to eGFR around 20–30 mL/min/1.73 m² in trials, glycemic efficacy wanes as eGFR declines; if eGFR is below 45, the glucose-lowering effect is reduced, so dose escalation for glycemia is less compelling, though cardiorenal benefits may persist [^115yENMm] [^114xodmp] [^112t5f7s]. I should also assess volume status and diuretic use; empagliflozin can potentiate loop diuretic effects and increase volume depletion risk, so if the patient is on a loop diuretic or has tenuous volume status, I should be cautious and consider diuretic dose reduction rather than SGLT2 dose escalation [^114MhzwG] [^111hFySw] [^112e8tUU].

> Let me consider what to add if the goal is improved glycemic control rather than more SGLT2 effect. The preferred next step is a GLP-1 receptor agonist with proven cardiovascular benefit, which offers complementary mechanisms, additional A1c lowering, weight loss, and cardiovascular risk reduction; this aligns with contemporary guidelines prioritizing SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 RAs for patients with T2DM and cardiometabolic risk, independent of baseline A1c [^111YPr6n] [^111qpTGw] [^114v9fYd].

> I should double-check safety counseling and monitoring if I do escalate empagliflozin to 25 mg. I will counsel on genital yeast infections, maintain good hydration, and monitor for volume depletion, especially in older adults or those on diuretics; I will also reassess renal function and volume status after any dose change and consider reducing concomitant diuretic if symptoms of volume depletion emerge [^117Ncy4S] [^114MhzwG] [^112e8tUU].

> Putting this together, my recommendation is to keep empagliflozin at 10 mg for cardiorenal benefit and, if glycemic control remains suboptimal, add a GLP-1 RA rather than increase empagliflozin to 25 mg; if a GLP-1 RA is not suitable and the patient is tolerating therapy without volume issues, a cautious trial of empagliflozin 25 mg may be considered for modest additional A1c lowering, with explicit counseling and monitoring for adverse effects and no expectation of added cardiovascular or renal benefit from the higher dose [^115JdpUi] [^111YPr6n] [^111zazhE].

Do not increase Jardiance (empagliflozin) beyond **10 mg daily** for cardiorenal indications, as 10 mg is the evidence-based dose that reduces cardiovascular death, heart failure hospitalization, and CKD progression [^114mT4Uw] [^112AgNGU] [^115JdpUi]. For additional glycemic lowering, add metformin if not already used; if already on metformin, consider a **GLP-1 receptor agonist (e.g. semaglutide or dulaglutide)** for added A1c reduction and cardiovascular benefit [^111YPr6n] [^116KM8ci]. If metformin is contraindicated or not tolerated, add a DPP-4 inhibitor (e.g. sitagliptin) or basal insulin, tailoring to renal function and hypoglycemia risk [^111YPr6n]. Always assess renal function and volume status before changes, and monitor for genital infections, volume depletion, and **ketoacidosis** [^112e8tUU] [^111rD4Wx].

## Clinical evidence for empagliflozin dosing

Empagliflozin is approved for multiple indications, each with specific dosing recommendations:

| **Indication** | **Recommended dose** | **Clinical evidence** |
|-|-|-|
| Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) | 10 mg once daily; maximum 25 mg for glycemic control | FDA-approved dosing for glycemic control [^1112eymH] |
| Cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk reduction in T2DM | 10 mg once daily | FDA-approved dosing for cardiovascular risk reduction [^1112eymH] |
| Heart failure (HF) | 10 mg once daily | FDA-approved dosing for HF risk reduction [^114mT4Uw] |
| Chronic kidney disease (CKD) | 10 mg once daily | FDA-approved dosing for CKD risk reduction [^112AgNGU] |

---

The 10 mg dose is the standard for cardiovascular and renal protection, with no additional benefit from higher doses for these outcomes [^115JdpUi]. The 25 mg dose is reserved for additional glycemic control in T2DM when needed and tolerated [^117KSLKw].

---

## Clinical evidence for dose escalation

Evidence does not support increasing empagliflozin beyond 10 mg daily for cardiovascular or renal indications, as both 10 mg and 25 mg provide similar cardiovascular and renal benefits in clinical trials [^115JdpUi]. The 25 mg dose offers only modest additional glycemic lowering (~0.1% A1c) and increases adverse events, including genital infections and volume depletion [^111zazhE] [^117Ncy4S].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Guidelines consistently recommend empagliflozin 10 mg daily for cardiovascular and renal indications, with no routine escalation to 25 mg for these purposes [^115JdpUi]. The 25 mg dose is reserved for additional glycemic control in T2DM when needed and tolerated [^117KSLKw].

---

## Alternative medications for additional glycemic control

If additional glycemic control is needed, consider the following alternatives:

| **Medication class** | **Examples** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| Metformin | Metformin | First-line therapy; improves insulin sensitivity, reduces A1c by ~1% |
| GLP-1 receptor agonists | Semaglutide, dulaglutide | - Reduce A1c by ~1–1.5% <br/> - Weight loss <br/> - Cardiovascular benefits [^115JdpUi] |
| DPP-4 inhibitors | Sitagliptin, linagliptin | Modest A1c reduction (~0.5–0.8%), well-tolerated |
| Basal insulin | Glargine, degludec | Effective for advanced glycemic control, individualized dosing |

---

## Clinical considerations and precautions

Before adding or changing therapy, assess the following:

- **Renal function**: Empagliflozin is effective down to eGFR ~20 mL/min/1.73 m²; adjust other agents as needed [^115yENMm].
- **Volume status**: Monitor for volume depletion, especially with diuretics or in older adults [^112e8tUU].
- **Infection risk**: Counsel on genital infections and ketoacidosis symptoms [^111rD4Wx].
- **Hypoglycemia**: Risk increases with insulin or sulfonylureas; adjust doses as needed [^115ovf5a].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Do not increase**: Empagliflozin beyond 10 mg daily for cardiovascular or renal indications.
- **Add metformin**: If not already used, for additional glycemic control.
- **GLP-1 agonists**: Consider semaglutide or dulaglutide for added A1c reduction and cardiovascular benefit.
- **DPP-4 inhibitors or basal insulin**: Use if metformin or GLP-1 agonists are contraindicated or not tolerated.
- **Monitor**: Renal function, volume status, and adverse effects when adding or changing therapy [^112e8tUU].

---

Empagliflozin 10 mg daily is the optimal dose for cardiovascular and renal protection; do not increase to 25 mg for these indications. For additional glycemic control, add metformin, a GLP-1 receptor agonist, or other appropriate therapy, with careful monitoring of renal function, volume status, and adverse effects.

Key Points

Question

What are the safety and efficacy of empagliflozin in patients with heart failure and preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) with background diuretic use?

Findings

In this post hoc analysis of a randomized clinical trial, empagliflozin was associated with comparable improvements in time to cardiovascular death or heart failure hospitalization, first and total heart failure hospitalizations, rate of decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate, and health status, regardless of background diuretic use or dose. Empagliflozin was also associated with a reduced likelihood of diuretic initiation or dose escalation and an increased likelihood of diuretic de-escalation and discontinuation after randomization.

Meaning

The findings suggest that treatment with empagliflozin in patients with HFpEF should be independent of diuretic therapy and may result in reduced need for diuretics.

Safety

When selecting a therapy for an individual patient, hypoglycemia risk is usually a key driver. In clinical trials, empagliflozin has not been associated with hypoglycemia, with no increase in risk of confirmed hypoglycemia except when used with background sulfonylurea or fixed-dose insulin. When empagliflozin was given as monotherapy, or as add-on to stable metformin, pioglitazone (with or without metformin), or metformin plus sulfonylurea, no confirmed hypoglycemic AEs that required assistance were reported.

For clinical practice, a key question is the proportion of patients likely to discontinue the drug because of AEs. Across a pooled analysis of all empagliflozin randomized clinical trials, including 3695 patients who received placebo, 3806 empagliflozin 10 mg, and 4782 empagliflozin 25 mg, a similar percentage in each treatment group discontinued because of an AE (5.0%, 5.3%, and 5.6% in the empagliflozin 10, 25 mg, and placebo groups, respectively). The AEs most commonly associated with empagliflozin at either dose have been urinary tract infections and genital mycotic infections. For genital mycotic infections, the association with empagliflozin is clear, with these AEs occurring in 4.7% of the empagliflozin 10 mg group, 5.6% of the 25 mg group, and 1.1% of the placebo group in the pooled analysis. For urinary tract infections, the association is less clear: across the pooled analysis, the incidence was similar across groups, but an increased risk has been recorded in some of the individual trials; for example, with monotherapy, events consistent with urinary tract infection were reported in 5% of the placebo group, 7% of the empagliflozin 10 mg group, and 5% of the empagliflozin 25 mg group. In the pooled analysis, urosepsis was reported in 0.1%, 0.1%, and < 0.1% of the placebo, empagliflozin 10 mg, and empagliflozin 25 mg groups, respectively, and pyelonephritis was reported in 0.1%, < 0.1%, and < 0.1% of the respective groups, suggesting no increased risk. However, 19 cases of urosepsis and pyelonephritis that started as urinary tract infections in patients taking SGLT2 inhibitors were identified among events reported to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Adverse Event Reporting System database. All cases were hospitalized, and two needed hemodialysis. The database included events reported between March 2013 and October 2014, and as empagliflozin was not available in the US until September 2014, it is not surprising that the reported cases occurred with canagliflozin (n = 10) or dapagliflozin (n = 9), and the FDA has added warnings and precautions to the labeling for all SGLT2 inhibitors, including empagliflozin. Patients should be advised about signs and symptoms of urinary tract infections, as well as about seeking medical advice, so they can be treated promptly, if appropriate.

Empagliflozin: Expanding Boundaries

The EMPA-REG OUTCOME results should be carefully interpreted to assess their impact on diabetes care and outcomes. While the findings for different subsets of patients need to be studied separately, the EMPA-REG OUTCOME study also throws up a few interesting questions (Table 1). Will these beneficial results be relevant to persons with T2DM and low CV risk, or to persons with type 1 diabetes mellitus? Whether the findings of empagliflozin can be extrapolated to other sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) are open to discussion. CVOTs are underway for both canagliflozin and dapagliflozin, and their results will decide whether the CV benefits of empagliflozin are a class effect or not.

It is also uncertain if empagliflozin can be initiated, or continue to be used, in acute coronary settings, including unstable angina, MI, and heart failure. However, while translating CVOT evidence to practice one should not lose sight of good clinical sense. SGLT2i biology and pharmacology should be understood in detail before prescribing SGLT2i. This therapy should be accompanied by appropriate medication counseling and should not be prescribed to persons at risk of ketoacidosis or recurrent genital infections.

Results

Patient Disposition

Seventy-four patients were screened and 48 (39 white males, 8 white females, 1 black female) were randomized (12 to each dose group, with 9 patients randomized to receive empagliflozin treatment and 3 to placebo). All randomized patients received at least 1 dose of study drug; 46 patients received 8 doses of empagliflozin or placebo over 8 days, 1 patient received 6 doses of placebo over 6 days, and 1 patient received 2 doses of empagliflozin over 2 days. Forty-six patients completed the study, with 2 patients discontinuing treatment prematurely due to adverse events. Baseline characteristics are summarized in Table 1.

The guidelines added the new recommendation, "In people with clinical cardiovascular disease in whom glycemic targets are not met, an SGLT2 inhibitor with demonstrated cardiovascular outcome benefit should be added to antihyperglycemic therapy to reduce the risk for cardiovascular and all-cause mortality (Grade A, Level 1A for empagliflozin)". The guidelines refer to selecting an "SGLT2 inhibitor with demonstrated CV outcome benefit" possibly anticipating a class effect when outcome trials for other SGLT2 inhibitors are reported (Table 2).

Among cardiologists, the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) has recently revised their guidelines for CV disease prevention, including an update to the guidance on glucose control in patients with T2DM. Metformin remains the first-line option, but based on the results of the EMPA-REG OUTCOME study, the ESC recommends that an SGLT2 inhibitor should be considered very early in the course of diabetes management in patients with T2DM and existing CV disease. The ESC also updated their guidelines on heart failure to include empagliflozin to prevent or delay the onset of heart failure in patients with T2DM. As with general CV disease prevention recommendations, they continue to recommend metformin as first-line therapy for glycemic control and also point out that intensification of glucose control with agents other than empagliflozin does not reduce the risk of heart failure.

### Improved glucose control with weight loss, lower insulin doses, and no increased hypoglycemia with empagliflozin added to titrated multiple daily injections of insulin in obese inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes [^111zazhE]. Diabetes Care (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

We investigated the efficacy and safety of the sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor, empagliflozin, added to multiple daily injections of insulin (MDI insulin) in obese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).

Research Design and Methods

Patients inadequately controlled on MDI insulin ± metformin (mean HbA1c 8.3% [67 mmol/mol]; BMI 34.8 kg/m(2); insulin dose 92 international units/day) were randomized and treated with once-daily empagliflozin 10 mg (n = 186), empagliflozin 25 mg (n = 189), or placebo (n = 188) for 52 weeks. Insulin dose was to remain stable in weeks 1–18, adjusted to meet glucose targets in weeks 19–40, then stable in weeks 41–52. The primary end point was change from baseline in HbA1c at week 18. Secondary end points were changes from baseline in insulin dose, weight, and HbA1c at week 52.

Results

Adjusted mean ± SE changes from baseline in HbA1c were -0.50 ± 0.05% (-5.5 ± 0.5 mmol/mol) for placebo versus -0.94 ± 0.05% (-10.3 ± 0.5 mmol/mol) and -1.02 ± 0.05% (-11.1 ± 0.5 mmol/mol) for empagliflozin 10 mg and empagliflozin 25 mg, respectively, at week 18 (both P < 0.001). At week 52, further reductions with insulin titration resulted in changes from baseline in HbA1c of -0.81 ± 0.08% (-8.9 ± 0.9 mmol/mol), -1.18 ± 0.08% (-12.9 ± 0.9 mmol/mol), and -1.27 ± 0.08% (-13.9 ± 0.9 mmol/mol) with placebo, empagliflozin 10 mg, and empagliflozin 25 mg, respectively, and final HbA1c of 7.5% (58 mmol/mol), 7.2% (55 mmol/mol), and 7.1% (54 mmol/mol), respectively. More patients attained HbA1c < 7% (< 53 mmol/mol) with empagliflozin (31–42%) versus placebo (21%; both P < 0.01). Empagliflozin 10 mg and empagliflozin 25 mg reduced insulin doses (-9 to -11 international units/day) and weight (-2.4 to -2.5 kg) versus placebo (all P < 0.01) at week 52.

Conclusions

In obese, difficult-to-treat patients with T2DM inadequately controlled on high MDI insulin doses, empagliflozin improved glycemic control and reduced weight without increasing the risk of hypoglycemia and with lower insulin requirements.

### Adverse drug events associated with low-dose (10 mg) versus high-dose (25 mg) empagliflozin in patients treated for type 2 diabetes mellitus: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^117SPeuY]. Diabetes Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Empagliflozin is a new, emerging oral hypoglycemic agent (OHA) which has shown significant benefits in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients with cardiovascular disease. In this analysis, our aim was to systematically compare the adverse drug events (ADEs) associated with a low (10 mg) versus a high (25 mg) dose of empagliflozin as (1) monotherapy, (2) as an add-on to other OHAs, and (3) as an add-on specifically to metformin, in patients who were treated for T2DM.

Methods

This was a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials that compared empagliflozin 10 mg versus 25 mg in patients who were treated for T2DM and which reported adverse drug reactions as their clinical endpoints. Statistical analysis was carried out using the latest version of the RevMan software (ver. 5.3) whereby odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were generated.

Results

Eight trials with a total number of 8514 patients treated for T2DM were included in this meta-analysis and systematic review, of whom 4261 patients received 10 mg empagliflozin and 4253 patients received 25 mg empagliflozin. Our results showed that there were no significant differences between the patients with T2DM receiving 10 empagliflozin and those receiving 25 mg empagliflozin in terms of drug-related adverse effects (OR 1.06, 95% CI 0.93–1.21; P = 0.40, I² = 0%), adverse events leading to drug discontinuation (OR 0.99, 95% CI 0.86–1.14; P = 0.87, I² = 0%), and serious adverse events (OR 1.06, 95% CI 0.95–1.18; P = 0.31, I² = 0%) when empagliflozin was provided as monotherapy or as an add-on to other anti-diabetic medications. The same results were obtained when empagliflozin was used as an add-on to metformin or as monotherapy. The duration of the follow-up periods did not affect the results. However, the incidence of genital and urinary tract infections (UTIs) was significantly higher in female patients than in male patients with 10 or 25 mg empagliflozin.

Conclusions

The incidence of ADEs was not significantly different in T2DM patients receiving 10 versus 25 mg empagliflozin as monotherapy or as add-on to metformin or other anti-diabetic drugs during a shorter or longer follow-up period. However, genital and UTIs were more common in female patients with T2DM irrespective of empagliflozin dosage.

SGLT2 inhibitors with CV benefit — initiation and renal dose modifications — should be initiated at the lowest dose tested in CV and renal outcomes trials, and no further dose titration is needed for CV or renal risk reduction. For canagliflozin, dose modifications are: eGFR 30 to 59 mL/min/1.73 m2: max dose 100 mg daily; and eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2: use is not recommended for glycemic control. For dapagliflozin, eGFR < 45 mL/min/1.73 m2: use is not recommended for glycemic control; and eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2: use is contraindicated. For empagliflozin, eGFR < 45 mL/min/1.73 m2: use is not recommended.

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS

2.1 Thetrial

This was a post hoc analysis of the EMPA‐REG OUTCOME randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled trial. The trial designand primary results, have been previously published. In brief, patients with type 2 diabetes with an HbA1c of 7.0%‐9.0% for drug‐naïve patients, and 7.0%‐10.0% for those on stable antihyperglycaemic therapy, established ASCVD, and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 or higher, were randomly assigned to empagliflozin 10 mg, 25 mg, or placebo administered once daily in addition to standard of care. Among insulin‐treated participants, total daily prescribed dose could not be changed within the 12 weeks prior to randomization by more than 10% from the dose at randomization. During the initial 12 weeks of treatment, antihyperglycaemic therapies were to be kept unchanged to assess the early glycaemic and metabolic effects of empagliflozin. However, changes were permitted if the patient had a confirmed fasting glucose level of more than 240 mg/dL (> 13.3 mmol/L) or for symptomatic hypoglycaemia. After 12 weeks, investigators were encouraged to follow local guidelines for achieving glycaemic control by adjusting background antihyperglycaemic therapy as needed, and for treating other cardiovascular risk factors. Median follow‐up was 3.1 years.

### The SGLT2 inhibitor empagliflozin for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus: a bench to bedside review [^113BLUip]. Diabetes Therapy (2014). Low credibility.

Additional Phase II and Phase III trials are underway and have been designed to test the safety and efficacy of empagliflozin over longer follow-up and in larger numbers of patients, representing a broad range of clinical subtypes (severity, duration, age, ethnicity, etc.). These ongoing trials will provide key data on the safety and efficacy of empagliflozin, often in combination with other anti-diabetes treatments, including cardiovascular outcomes data in patients at high cardiovascular risk. Therefore, patients and their healthcare providers will be in an informed position to leverage the potential of these drugs, in the context of a growing movement toward more individualized approaches to diabetes care.

### Empagliflozin as add-on to metformin plus sulfonylurea in patients with type 2 diabetes: a 24-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^111GmJKE]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Hypertension is an important cardiovascular risk factor associated with type 2 diabetes. In this study, a significant reduction in SBP was observed with empagliflozin compared with placebo, without an increase in pulse rate. This may reflect osmotic diuresis associated with urinary glucose excretion, which may also explain the small increase in hematocrit. Unexpectedly, no reduction in DBP was observed at week 24. As a limitation of the study, changes in antihypertensive medication were allowed, possibly diluting the effect of empagliflozin versus placebo on blood pressure. A reduction in uric acid levels was observed in patients treated with empagliflozin, compared with an increase in patients on placebo. In many epidemiological studies, lower uric acid levels have been associated with lower cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.

Empagliflozin was well tolerated when used as add-on therapy to metformin plus sulfonylurea for 24 weeks. More patients reported serious AEs with placebo than empagliflozin, and the number of patients who discontinued due to AEs was similar between the randomized empagliflozin groups and the placebo group. More randomized patients reported confirmed hypoglycemic events with empagliflozin than with placebo. This suggests that empagliflozin in combination with sulfonylurea may increase the risk of hypoglycemia, whereas empagliflozin alone has a low risk of hypoglycemia. Importantly, empagliflozin as add-on to on metformin plus sulfonylurea did not cause any hypoglycemic events that required assistance.

Patients with type 2 diabetes, particularly female patients, are at increased risk of UTIs; however, the reported incidence varies between trials due to different reporting methods. In this trial, the proportion of patients with events consistent with UTI was slightly higher with empagliflozin 10 mg than with empagliflozin 25 mg or placebo, and the proportion of patients reporting genital infections was higher with empagliflozin than with placebo. This is consistent with data on other SGLT2 inhibitors, which show that a higher proportion of patients report genital infections with the SGLT2 inhibitor versus placebo, but the proportion of patients who report UTIs is similar or only slightly higher with SGLT2 inhibitor versus placebo.

Empagliflozin 10 and 25 mg showed no difference in efficacy or tolerability in this trial, even though a dose-dependent increase in urinary glucose excretion and a dose-dependent decrease in HbA 1c have been reported in phase I/II studies. Dose dependency of empagliflozin will be evaluated based on the totality of data from phase III trials comprising more than 10,000 patients.

### Empagliflozin as add-on to linagliptin in a fixed-dose combination in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes: glycaemic efficacy and safety profile in a 52-week, randomized, placebo-controlled trial [^112F1FGB]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

Fasting plasma insulin was significantly reduced by empagliflozin/linagliptin therapy as compared with linagliptin alone, accompanied by reduced plasma glucose. Further, empagliflozin/linagliptin therapy improved metabolic control without an increase in glucagon. Previous studies have suggested that empagliflozin and other SGLT2 inhibitors lower fasting and postprandial insulin, but increase glucagon. 31, 32, 33, 34 In contrast, DPP‐4 inhibitors, including linagliptin, have been shown to reduce glucagon levels, and to either increase or have no effect on fasting insulin levels. 35, 36

These study results are strengthened by the randomized, double‐blind, double‐dummy, placebo‐controlled design and the 16‐week linagliptin pre‐treatment period. This design reflects the clinical setting in which empagliflozin is added to treatment in patients who are inadequately controlled with linagliptin by switching to the FDC formulation. The extended up‐titration period, required for regulatory purposes, demonstrated the long‐term efficacy and safety of both lower and higher doses of empagliflozin, as occurs in clinical practice. Completion rates through 52 weeks were high (> 90%), as was statistical power for the primary endpoint, and a broad range of outcome measures, with the exception of postprandial glucose levels, were assessed. Although the enrolment of Japanese patients only limits generalizability to other populations, the results are consistent with other multinational studies. Finally, the use of rescue medication in more than half of the patients in the placebo group reflects the need for multiple therapeutic agents in the study population.

In conclusion, switching from linagliptin monotherapy to empagliflozin/linagliptin FDC was well tolerated and resulted in clinically significant reductions in HbA1c, FPG, body weight and SBP in Japanese patients with T2DM. Thus, an empagliflozin/linagliptin fixed‐dose combination represents an attractive therapeutic option for these patients, with potentially additive cardio‐renal benefits from empagliflozin as well as a formulation expected to improve adherence.

### 2020 expert consensus decision pathway on novel therapies for cardiovascular risk reduction in patients with type 2 diabetes: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^115JdpUi]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2020). High credibility.

Type 2 diabetes cardiovascular risk reduction — initiation and titration of SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) should follow trial-tested dosing. SGLT2 inhibitors with CV benefit should be initiated at the lowest dose tested in CV and renal outcomes trials (e.g., 100 mg for canagliflozin, 10 mg for dapagliflozin, 10 mg for empagliflozin), and no further dose titration is needed for CV or renal risk reduction. Among GLP-1RAs, dulaglutide, liraglutide, or injectable semaglutide have demonstrated CV benefit to reduce the risk of MACE, and a GLP-1RA with demonstrated CV benefit should be initiated at the lowest dose and up-titrated stepwise to the doses used in the trials or the otherwise maximal tolerated dose. Prior to initiating T2D therapies aimed at CV disease risk reduction, a detailed patient-clinician risk discussion is recommended, including risks, benefits, drug-drug interactions, safety, patient preferences, and cost considerations.

SGLT2 inhibitor use to manage ASCVD, HF, and DKD risk in type 2 diabetes follows this algorithm: Patient is ≥ 18 years old with T2D and ≥ 1 of the following: ASCVD, HF, DKD, or at high risk for ASCVD. If the patient is pregnant or breast feeding, do not start an SGLT2 inhibitor (no safety data available). If the patient's eGFR < 30 ml/min/1.73 m², do not start an SGLT2 inhibitor. If not, consider starting an SGLT2 inhibitor with proven ASCVD, HF, or DKD benefit; after a discussion incorporating patient-clinician preferences and priorities, if the patient wishes to initiate an SGLT2 inhibitor, initiate an SGLT2 inhibitor with proven ASCVD, HF, or DKD benefit. Canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, or empagliflozin is appropriate. No dose titration is required. Adjust other antihyperglycemic therapies if necessary. Monitor response to therapy and consider further therapies for CV risk reduction, as indicated. This may include the addition of a GLP-1RA in the appropriate patient.

Empagliflozin: Coadministration with Other Drugs and Cardiac Safety

Patients with T2DM vary widely in age and often have significant comorbidities, including advanced cardiovascular disease; therefore, this patient population often is receiving several medications concurrently in addition to other anti-diabetes drugs. Accordingly, any potential adverse interactions between empagliflozin and other commonly prescribed drugs are of clinical interest.

Coadministration with a number of clinically important drugs that could reasonably be expected to be prescribed in the T2DM patient population has been tested in a series of open-label, crossover studies in healthy volunteers. These studies showed that empagliflozin can be given together with the anti-diabetes drugs metformin or sitagliptin, the commonly prescribed cardiovascular drugs verapamil, ramipril, and digoxin, and the anticoagulant warfarin; in each case without the need for dose adjustment for either empagliflozin or the coadministered drug. In a similar open-label study, researchers demonstrated a combined oral contraceptive ethinylestradiol 30 μg/levonorgestrel 150 μg once daily can be coadministered with oral empagliflozin 25 mg once daily, without requirement for dose adjustment.

A number of drugs are known to prolong the cardiac QT interval, which can lead to life-threatening arrhythmias in treated patients. To assess the cardiac safety of empagliflozin, 30 volunteers with a mean age of 35 years were randomized to a double-blind, placebo-controlled study of single doses of empagliflozin, 25 and 200 mg (therapeutic and supratherapeutic, respectively), versus placebo and open-label moxifloxacin 400 mg as positive control. Within the initial 1–4 h after empagliflozin dosing, the placebo-corrected mean change from baseline in the population heart rate corrected QT interval was 0.6 ms [90% confidence interval (CI) −0.7, 1.9] for empagliflozin 25 mg and −0.2 ms (90% CI −1.4, 0.9) for empagliflozin 200 mg. These values are deemed acceptable since the upper limit of the confidence intervals are < 10 ms, which is the International Conference on Harmonization E14 threshold for regulatory concern. Consistent with the results seen in other trials, the tolerability of empagliflozin was good for all study participants, with 23.3% of the empagliflozin group experiencing AEs with empagliflozin compared with 27.6% of the placebo group.

### Effects of empagliflozin on insulin initiation or intensification in patients with type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease: findings from the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial [^117TM282]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Aim

To evaluate the effects of empagliflozin versus placebo on subsequent insulin initiation or dosing changes in a large cardiovascular outcomes trial.

Materials and Methods

In EMPA-REG OUTCOME, 7020 patients with type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease received empagliflozin 10 mg, 25mg, or placebo. Median follow-up was 3.1years. After 12weeks of treatment, changes in background antihyperglycaemic therapy were permitted. Among insulin-naïve patients, we assessed the effects of pooled empagliflozin arms versus placebo on time to initiation of insulin. Among insulin-treated patients, we assessed effects on time to an increase or decrease in insulin dose of more than 20%.

Results

In 3633 (52%) participants not treated with insulin at baseline, empagliflozin reduced new use of insulin versus placebo by 60% (7.1% vs. 16.4%; adjusted HR 0.40 [95% CI 0.32–0.49]; P < .0001). In 3387 (48%) patients using insulin at baseline, empagliflozin reduced the need for a greater than 20% insulin dose increase by 58% (14.4% vs. 29.3%; adjusted HR 0.42 [95% CI 0.36–0.49]; P < .0001) and increased the proportion achieving sustained greater than 20% insulin dose reductions without subsequent increases in HbA1c compared with placebo (9.2% vs. 4.9%; adjusted HR 1.87 [95% CI: 1.39–2.51]; P < .0001). Sensitivity analyses confirmed consistent findings when insulin dose changes of more than 10% or more than 30% were considered.

Conclusions

In patients with type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease, empagliflozin markedly and durably delays insulin initiation and substantial increases in insulin dose, while facilitating sustained reductions in insulin requirements over time.

### Empagliflozin: role in treatment options for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus [^113mhxH8]. Diabetes Therapy (2017). Low credibility.

Although the majority of patients with T2DM have hypertension, it was not essential for enrollment in empagliflozin clinical trials, nor were concurrent antihypertensive medications held stable during the trial periods. To look at this group specifically, empagliflozin has also been studied in a dedicated trial in patients with hypertension in addition to T2DM. Patients were required to have seated office SBP 130–159 mmHg/DBP 80–99 mmHg and be on a maximum of two antihypertensive medications that were at stable doses and were continued unchanged throughout the 12-week study. In addition to office BP measurements, patients had ambulatory 24-h BP monitoring before randomization, and again at week 12, with the devices measuring BP and pulse every 20 min. At week 12, both empagliflozin doses gave significant reductions in 24-h SBP (−3.44 mmHg with 10 mg and −4.16 mmHg with 25 mg vs. placebo; both P < 0.001) and in 24-h DBP (−1.36 mmHg with 10 mg and −1.72 mmHg with 25 mg; both P < 0.001). In this study, events consistent with volume depletion were reported for one patient (0.4%) in the placebo group, one (0.4%) in the empagliflozin 10 mg group, and none in the empagliflozin 25 mg group, similar to the low proportions seen in the pooled analysis above. The BP reductions in this study and in the pooled analysis were not associated with increases in pulse rate, suggesting empagliflozin may inhibit the sympathetic response.

RESULTS

Patients

In total, 67.0% of patients from the 12-week monotherapy dose-finding trial (study 1) continued in the extension trial. A total of 106 patients were randomized to receive 10 mg empagliflozin, 109 patients were randomized to 25 mg empagliflozin, and 56 patients continued on metformin. In total, 78.4% of patients from the 12-week add-on to metformin dose-finding trial (study 2) continued in the extension trial. A total of 166 patients were randomized to receive 10 mg empagliflozin, 166 patients were randomized to 25 mg empagliflozin, and 56 patients continued on sitagliptin. Patient demographics and baseline characteristics were balanced between groups (Table 1). Of 660 patients enrolled from both study 1 and study 2, 607 patients (92%) completed the trial. One patient withdrew consent before taking the first dose of study medication during the extension, and 52 patients (7.9%) prematurely discontinued trial medication. The most frequent reason for discontinuation was AEs (23 patients [3.5%]).

Patient demographics and baseline characteristics of all treated patients in the extension trial

Efficacy

Patients who received empagliflozin over 90 weeks (any dose of empagliflozin during study 1 or 2, 10 or 25 mg during the extension trial) showed clinically meaningful reductions in HbA 1c, FPG, body weight, and waist circumference at week 78 of the extension study compared with baseline of the preceding trial (Table 2). In the monotherapy groups, 31.9, 32.1, and 31.0% of patients on 10 mg empagliflozin, 25 mg empagliflozin, and metformin, respectively, reached HbA 1c < 7% (< 53 mmol/mol) at week 78 of the extension study. Of patients on background metformin therapy, 27.0, 44.6, and 36.8% of patients on 10 mg empagliflozin, 25 mg empagliflozin, and sitagliptin, respectively, reached HbA 1c < 7% (< 53 mmol/mol) at week 78 of the extension study. Clinically meaningful reductions from baseline in blood pressure were observed in most empagliflozin groups except for the 10 mg empagliflozin monotherapy group (Table 2). Reductions in blood pressure were not associated with increases in heart rate (data not shown).

### Safety and efficacy of empagliflozin and diuretic use in patients with heart failure and preserved ejection fraction: a post hoc analysis of the EMPEROR-preserved trial [^114wpj3X]. JAMA Cardiology (2023). High credibility.

Discussion

This study yields several notable findings. First, analysis of the placebo arm of the EMPEROR-Preserved trial showed that diuretic therapy was a risk marker for adverse outcomes in HFpEF, with higher doses associated with greater risk. Second, the benefit of empagliflozin on first HHF or CV death, first HHF, and total HHF was consistent regardless of background diuretic therapy or diuretic dose. Third, patients taking higher doses of diuretics were less likely to experience weight loss or decrease in hemoglobin A 1c (in patients with diabetes) with empagliflozin. Fourth, among patients taking diuretics, the addition of empagliflozin was associated with an increased risk of volume depletion events but not of hyperkalemia or acute kidney failure. Fifth, patients randomized to empagliflozin (vs placebo) had a lesser likelihood of diuretic initiation and dose escalation and a greater likelihood of diuretic de-escalation and permanent discontinuation.

In the EMPEROR-Preserved trial, approximately 80% of the patients were treated with diuretics at baseline, which is similar to other contemporary HFpEF and HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) cohorts. To our knowledge, the current study is the first to delineate characteristics of diuretic use in patients with HFpEF. The most common furosemide-equivalent dose of diuretics in EMPEROR-Preserved was 40 mg, similar to patients with HFrEF in the DAPA-HF trial. Patients who were not treated with diuretics at baseline had the most favorable clinical profile and better outcomes. Higher baseline doses of diuretics were associated with more severe HF, poorer HRQoL, greater burden of comorbidities, and a higher risk of adverse outcomes. However, the benefit of empagliflozin on the primary outcome (first HHF or CV death), first HHF, total HHF, eGFR slope, and HRQoL was consistent regardless of baseline diuretic status or dose. This is in line with findings from HFrEF patients in the DAPA-HF trial, where baseline diuretic therapy did not modify the benefit of dapagliflozin on these outcomes.

1 INTRODUCTION

Insulin is a core antihyperglycaemic therapy and is often needed in the longitudinal management of type 2 diabetes to control blood glucose concentrations. Global insulin requirements are projected to increase by more than 20% by 2030, driven by forecasted increases in the prevalence of type 2 diabetes, in large part as a result of the longer survival of people living with type 2 diabetes. Although insulin use does not appear to directly adversely influence cardiovascular risk or overall mortality, the need for insulin intensification in practice represents a marker of clinical progression and tracks with the accumulation of cardiometabolic risk factors. Indeed, insulin use identifies a particularly high‐risk cohort of patients with type 2 diabetes for adverse cardiovascular events and premature death. Depending on the health system, insulin can be expensive and requires time, training, and resource expenditure to support its use. Treatment‐attendant adverse effects of insulin such as hypoglycaemia and weight gain, may be particularly problematic for patients with concomitant cardiovascular disease. Especially in the context of availability of newer antihyperglycaemic options, delaying, preventing, or reducing the need for insulin intensification represents an attractive adjunctive management goal for both patients and practitioners.

The sodium‐glucose co‐transporter‐2 (SGLT‐2) inhibitors have modest glycaemic effectsand may improve β‐cell function and insulin sensitivity. In the EMPA‐REG OUTCOME trial involving participants with type 2 diabetes and established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), empagliflozin reduced cardiovascular and kidney outcomes, independent of glycaemic control, and irrespective of background antihyperglycaemic therapy, including the use of insulin. Limited data were available regarding the effects of SGLT‐2 inhibitor initiation on subsequent need for insulin commencement or intensification.

We determined the treatment effects of empagliflozin relative to placebo and in addition to standard of care on the time to initiation of insulin treatment among insulin‐naïve participants, and time to substantial increases or decreases in insulin dose among insulin‐treated participants. In exploratory analyses, assuming stable treatment effects over time, we estimated the lifetime benefits of empagliflozin in delaying the need for insulin initiation using validated actuarial methods.

### Evidence from routine clinical practice: EMPRISE provides a new perspective on CVOTs [^115hdJLF]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2019). Medium credibility.

EMPA-REG OUTCOME is recognised by international guidelines as a landmark study that showed a significant cardioprotective benefit with empagliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and cardiovascular disease. To assess the impact of empagliflozin in routine clinical practice, the ongoing EMPRISE study is collecting real-world evidence to compare effectiveness, safety and health economic outcomes between empagliflozin and DPP-4 inhibitors. A planned interim analysis of EMPRISE was recently published, confirming a substantial reduction in hospitalisation for heart failure with empagliflozin across a diverse patient population. In this commentary article, we discuss the new data in the context of current evidence and clinical guidelines, as clinicians experienced in managing cardiovascular risk in patients with T2D. We also look forward to what future insights EMPRISE may offer, as evidence is accumulated over the next years to complement the important findings of EMPA-REG OUTCOME.

### Safety and tolerability of empagliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes [^117Ncy4S]. Clinical Therapeutics (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose

The aim of this analysis was to establish the safety profile and tolerability of empagliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) according to pooled data from several clinical trials.

Methods

Pooled data were analyzed from patients with T2DM treated with placebo (n = 3695), empagliflozin 10 mg (n = 3806), or empagliflozin 25 mg (n = 4782) in 17 randomized, Phase I, II, and III clinical trials plus 6 extension studies. Adverse events (AEs) were assessed descriptively in patients who took ≥ 1 dose of the study drug. AE incidence rates per 100 patient-years were calculated to adjust for differences in drug exposure across trials.

Findings

Total exposure was 3254, 3840, and 5649 patient-years in the placebo, empagliflozin 10 mg, and empagliflozin 25 mg groups, respectively. The incidence of any AEs, AEs leading to treatment discontinuation, severe AEs, and serious AEs was no higher in patients treated with empagliflozin than with placebo. Empagliflozin was not associated with an increased risk of hypoglycemia versus placebo, except in patients on background sulfonylurea and/or insulin. The incidence of events consistent with urinary tract infection was similar across treatment groups (9.4–11.3/100 patient-years); 0.4%, 0.2%, and 0.3% of patients in the placebo, empagliflozin 10 mg, and empagliflozin 25 mg groups, respectively, had urinary tract infections that required or prolonged hospitalization. The incidence of events consistent with genital infection was higher in patients treated with empagliflozin (4.7 and 5.0/100 patient-years for empagliflozin 10 and 25 mg, respectively) than placebo (1.3/100 patient-years), but only 0.1%, 0.1%, and < 0.1% in the placebo, empagliflozin 10 mg, and empagliflozin 25 mg groups, respectively, had genital infections that required or prolonged hospitalization. The incidence of AEs consistent with volume depletion was similar with placebo, empagliflozin 10 mg, and empagliflozin 25 mg (1.6, 1.5, and 1.3/100 patient-years, respectively) and was higher with empagliflozin 25 mg than placebo or empagliflozin 10 mg in patients aged > 75 years (4.4 vs 2.3 and 2.5/100 patient-years, respectively). The incidences of bone fractures, malignancies, decreased renal function, hepatic injury, venous thromboembolic events, and diabetic ketoacidosis were low and similar across the treatment groups.

Implications

In this predefined analysis that was based on > 9000 patient-years' exposure to empagliflozin, empagliflozin 10 mg, and empagliflozin 25 mg were well tolerated in patients with T2DM.

Methods

Study Subjects

This was a retrospective, longitudinal study of patients with T2DM who presented to Nishinihon Hospital between January 2019 and June 2020. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records and collected various information on participants whose dose of empagliflozin was increased from 10 mg once daily to 25 mg once daily, and who did not receive any additional medications such as antihypertensive or antihyperlipidemic drugs, for 6 months. We used the following inclusion criteria: (1) patients who were continuing to visit the hospital for blood glucose control; (2) patients who were already prescribed 10 mg of empagliflozin once daily; and (3) patients from whom blood samples had been collected early in the morning in the fasting state. Participants meeting the following criteria were excluded: (1) < 20 years of age; (2) having type 1 diabetes; (3) pregnancy; (4) active infectious disease including urinary tract infection; (5) severe hepatic disease; and (6) malignancy.

Age, sex, height, weight, blood pressure, and pre-existing use of hypoglycemic agents, anti-hypertensive agents or anti-hyperlipidemic agents were recorded. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated as weight divided by height squared (kg/m 2). Kidney function was estimated via the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) on the basis of age, sex and serum creatinine using the equation for Japanese subjects developed by Matsuo et al.

Compliance with Ethics Guidelines

All procedures in this study involving human participants were performed in accordance with the ethical standards of the institutional and/or national research committee and the 1964 Helsinki Declaration and its later amendments or comparable ethical standards. The study protocol was approved by the Human Ethics Review Committee of Nishinihon Hospital (protocol number: R2–7) and registered at UMIN-CTR (UMIN000041543). All subjects provided written informed consent.

### Safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of multiple rising doses of empagliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus [^116Zgp9C]. Diabetes Therapy (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

This study examined the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of empagliflozin, a potent and highly selective sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).

Methods

A total of 48 patients with T2DM were randomized to receive one of four doses of empagliflozin (2.5, 10, 25, or 100 mg qd) or placebo over 8 days. In every dose group, nine patients received active drug and three received placebo. The primary endpoint was safety and tolerability. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters were measured as secondary endpoints.

Results

Empagliflozin was rapidly absorbed, reaching peak levels 1.5–3.0 h after dosing and showed a biphasic decline. The mean terminal elimination half-life ranged from 10 to 19 h. Increases in exposure (area under the plasma concentration–time curve [AUC] and maximum concentration of analyte in plasma [C max]) were approximately proportional with dose. Empagliflozin increased the rate and total amount of glucose excreted in urine compared to placebo. After administration of a single dose of empagliflozin, cumulative amounts of glucose excreted in urine over 24 h ranged from 46.3 to 89.8 g, compared with 5.84 g with placebo. Similar results were seen after multiple doses. Fasting plasma glucose levels decreased by 17.2–25.8% with empagliflozin and by 12.7% with placebo. The frequency of adverse events was 33.3–66.7% with empagliflozin and 41.7% with placebo. There were no changes in urine volume or micturition frequency under the controlled study conditions.

Conclusion

Overall, pharmacokinetic assessments demonstrated a dose-proportional increase in drug exposure and support once-daily dosing. Elevated urinary glucose excretion was observed with all doses. Multiple once-daily oral doses of empagliflozin (2.5–100 mg) reduced plasma glucose and were well tolerated in patients with T2DM. EudraCT (2007–000654–32).

### Safety and efficacy of empagliflozin and diuretic use in patients with heart failure and preserved ejection fraction: a post hoc analysis of the EMPEROR-preserved trial [^116UBoa8]. JAMA Cardiology (2023). High credibility.

Conclusions

In this analysis, empagliflozin use was associated with improvement in HHF or CV death, first HHF, total HHF, eGFR slope, and KCCQ scores in patients with HFpEF, regardless of background diuretics use or dose. Empagliflozin was associated with a slightly increased risk of volume depletion in patients taking diuretics. Empagliflozin also reduced the likelihood of diuretic initiation and dose escalation and increased the likelihood of diuretic de-escalation and permanent discontinuation.

### Efficacy and safety evaluation of SGLT2i on blood pressure control in patients with type 2 diabetes and hypertension: a new meta-analysis [^115e4kbx]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2023). Medium credibility.

Systolic blood pressure is more clinically significant than diastolic blood pressure in patients with hypertension. The former is a more robust indicator of the risk of cardiovascular disease, which has led to an increasing emphasis on systolic blood pressure control in recent guidelines. This study preliminarily confirmed that SGLT2i can reduce 24-h systolic blood pressure and office systolic blood pressure in patients with type 2 diabetes and hypertension. SGLT2 reduced 24H systolic blood pressure by 5.06 mmHg and office systolic blood pressure by 4.53 mmHg, on average, compared with the equivalent dose of placebo. For 24H and mean office diastolic blood pressure, SGLT2i also showed a certain antihypertensive effect. The antihypertensive efficacy of SGLT2i is partly influenced by choice of first-line antihypertensive agents. Because SGLT2i lowers blood pressure by increasing urine volume, Dapagliflozin's blood pressure lowering properties are especially beneficial in patients who are already taking beta-blockers or calcium channel blockers, and the addition of Dapagliflozin may result in slightly more tremendous blood pressure lowering than in patients who are already taking thiazide diuretics. The analysis found that this literature was the primary source of heterogeneity. The intervention in this study was 25 mg empagliflozin with a treatment course of 12 weeks. Compared with other studies, there was no significant difference in the screening criteria of subjects and baseline data of population blood pressure in this literature. At the same time, the dose of SGLT2i was more prominent, and the treatment course was more protracted. Therefore, considering the combined effect of SGLT2i dose and course is the reason for the considerable heterogeneity, suggesting that the antihypertensive effect of the same type of SGLT2i may increase with the prolongation of the course. Keith leads to a similar conclusion: the effect of empagliflozin on blood pressure increased from 12 to 24 weeks, suggesting that at least 6 months of treatment is required for the full antihypertensive effect. In patients with type 2 diabetes combined with hypertension, aggressive medication to lower blood pressure is effective in reducing the incidence of stroke, heart failure and microangiopathy. The 2022 American Diabetes Association Standards of Medical Therapy for Diabetes recommend that patients with diabetes combined with hypertension who are at high cardiovascular risk may have their blood pressure reduced to < 130/80 mmHg as long as the target can be safely met. In these patients, symptomatic hypoglycaemic and antihypertensive therapy is the mainstay, with ACEI/ARB drugs recommended for blood pressure control. For those who need to combine multiple drugs to lower blood pressure, SGLT2i can be considered as the preferred option to reduce cardiac and renal damage while exerting the dual effect of lowering glucose and blood pressure and avoiding drug over-treatment.

Study Design

This was a multiple rising dose, randomized, double-blind trial with within-group placebo control. Patients were randomized upon admission to the trial center to one of four doses of empagliflozin (2.5, 10, 25, and 100 mg), which were tested sequentially in ascending order of dose. Within every dose group, patients were randomized 3:1 to receive active drug or placebo. Treatment allocation was carried out according to a randomized list of patient and medication numbers. Within each dose group, patients were randomized to receive placebo or active drug and patients and investigators were double blinded until the study had completed. Patients and investigators were aware of the dosing stage (but not if patients were receiving placebo).

Patients received a single dose on day 1 and once-daily dosing on days 3–9. The dosing on day 2 was skipped to allow estimation of the terminal elimination half-life after a single dose to compare with the steady state half-life. Study drug was administered at the same time every day with 240 mL of water. Patients were fasted overnight for 10 h on days −2, −1, 1, 8, and 9. An end-of-study examination was carried out in the 1-week post-treatment period (days 15–21). An oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT; administration of 75 g glucose solution after overnight fasting) was performed on days −1, 1, and 9.

Subjects

The trial was conducted at the Profil Institute for Metabolic Research, Neuss, Germany. Eligible subjects were patients with T2DM treated with diet and exercise only or ≤ 2 oral anti-diabetic agents with at least one agent taken at ≤ 50% of its maximum dose; HbA 1c ≤ 8.5% at screening; and body mass index (BMI) 18.5–40 kg/m 2. Patients on insulin or thiazolidinediones were excluded, as were patients with high fasting [> 240 mg/dL (13.3 mmol/L)] or postprandial [> 400 mg/dL (> 22 mmol/L)] blood glucose and patients with clinically significant concomitant diseases or abnormalities in the screening laboratory.

Characteristics of the Study Participants

A total of 52 participants were recruited in this study, and their baseline characteristics are summarized in Table 1. The median age and HbA1c of the study participants were 64.9 years and 7.46%, respectively. More than half of the patients were being treated with biguanides, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors and statins, and there were no further changes to medications after the dose of empagliflozin was increased during the 6-month trial period. During the observation period, no adverse events were observed.

### Practical approach to initiating SGLT2 inhibitors in type 2 diabetes [^115Mek7U]. Diabetes Therapy (2017). Low credibility.

Sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are an attractive novel therapeutic option for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. They block the reabsorption of filtered glucose in kidneys, mainly in proximal renal tubules, resulting in increased urinary glucose excretion and correction of the diabetes-related hyperglycemia. Beyond improving glucose control, SGLT2 inhibitors offer potential benefits by reducing body weight and blood pressure. On the basis of the efficacy demonstrated in clinical trials, SGLT2 inhibitors are recommended as second- or third-line agents for the management of patients with type 2 diabetes. Beneficial effects on kidney disease progression, cardiovascular and all-cause mortality, and hospitalization for heart failure have also been demonstrated with one SGLT2 inhibitor (empagliflozin). Potential adverse events resulting from their mechanism of action or related to concomitant therapies are reviewed. A treatment algorithm for the adjustment of concomitant therapies after initiating SGLT2 inhibitors is also proposed.

Empagliflozin Phase I Studies in Humans: Safety, Tolerability, and Pharmacokinetics

Phase I studies of single doses of empagliflozin were conducted in a study of 72 healthy male volunteers recruited at a single clinic in Germany. Subjects were randomized to an empagliflozin dose of 0.5–800 mg, or placebo. Empagliflozin was quickly absorbed after oral ingestion, with a median time to maximum plasma concentration (t max) of approximately 1.5–2.1 h, and total drug exposures were generally proportional with escalating doses. Empagliflozin also demonstrated a biphasic decline in plasma concentrations during the decay phase, with a terminal elimination half-life ranging from 8.6 to 13.1 h.

In these healthy volunteers, the rate of UGE increased with escalating doses, and reached a plateau around the 50-mg dose. The mean total amounts of glucose excreted in the urine during 24 h after administration of empagliflozin (0.5, 2.5, 10, 25, 50, 100, 200, 400, and 800 mg) were 3.1, 30.6, 47.9, 56.5, 63.6, 78.6, 69.1, 90.8, and 61.6 g, respectively, versus 0.06 g with placebo. The amounts of glucose excreted in the urine were similar under fed and fasted conditions, indicating food had no clinically relevant effects on drug absorption. In these healthy volunteers, empagliflozin had a good safety profile and was well tolerated: reported AEs included headaches, nervous system and gastrointestinal disorders; all were reported at similar frequencies in empagliflozin and placebo-treated subjects, and none were dose-dependent. There was one report of hypoglycemia, which was observed 3 h after an oral glucose tolerance test. Since the glucose levels showed mild hypoglycemia (53 mg/dL), it was considered to be reactive hypoglycemia, and therefore not related to study drug.

### Sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors as an early, first-line therapy in patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction [^111NtvKk]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2022). Medium credibility.

In the present review we summarized data supporting an early initiation of dapagliflozin, empagliflozin or, limited to diabetic patients, sotagliflozin, in patients with HFrEF. These drugs embody most of the ideal characteristics for a HFrEF medication, including single dose, once daily administration, no need for titration, early beneficial effects on clinical events and patient‐reported quality of life, and favourable safety and tolerability profile. The tendency to focus on possible side effects may lead to under‐prescription of evidence‐based medical therapy. However, in the case of SGLT2 inhibitors, serious adverse events are not different from placebo, so that strong and early efficacy is associated with safety and tolerability. Importantly, this includes minimal to no effect on SBP, reduced risk of hyperkalaemia, and favourable effects on renal outcomes, all of which complicate and limit management with neurohormonal antagonists and modulators. Guideline recommendations support the use of SGLT2 inhibitors (e.g. dapagliflozin, empagliflozin and sotagliflozin if concomitant T2DM) in addition to other GDMTs. In the rare case of really naive patients, until recently, there was only evidence for the start of ACEi and beta‐blockers together. With the presentation of EMPULSE trial results, we have also evidence for the safe and effective initiation of the SGLT2 inhibitor, empagliflozin, in patients with both de‐novo acute HF or decompensated chronic HF, once stabilization is achieved (Graphical Abstract). Thus, data summarized in this review support the early 'upfront' use of dapagliflozin or empagliflozin, rather than sequencing behind the other drugs acting on neurohormonal mechanisms (Table 3). The option for a simultaneous or rapid sequence strategy for quadruple medical therapy in patients with HFrEF should be personalized depending on patient characteristics and it is reasonable to propose different sequences with, however, SGLT2 inhibitors as possible first‐line therapy in most cases. Based on tolerability, target dose may or may not be able to be achieved or in certain circumstances decreases in dosing may be required, to ensure each medication is well tolerated. Due to lack of experience, when quadruple therapy is simultaneously or rapidly introduced, physicians should be more cautious and a close monitoring of electrolytes, kidney function and blood pressure may be appropriate.

Results

Searched Outcomes

Our initial search of the five databases using the chosen search items identified 1146 articles. A first selection of these 1146 articles based on the titles and abstracts resulted in the elimination of 985 articles. The full text of the remaining 181 articles was assessed for eligibility, and 173 of these were eliminated for not satisfying the inclusion criteria as follows: non-randomized controlled trials (n = 112); did not compare 10 versus 25 mg empagliflozin (n = 5); did not report adverse events (n = 2); pooled analyses (n = 3); duplicated studies (n = 51)

Ultimately, only eight trials satisfied all inclusion criteria and were included in the meta-analysis and systematic review. The flow chart for study selection is shown in Fig. 1.

General Features of the Trials

Eight trials with a total number of 8514 patients treated for T2DM were included in this analysis (4261 patients received 10 mg empagliflozin and 4253 patients received 25 mg empagliflozin). The time period during which patients were enrolled in each study ranged from 2009 to 2015. The general features of the trials are listed in Table 2.

Metformin co-therapy and cardioprotection — pivotal trials enrolled a high proportion of patients on metformin at baseline, but the cardioprotective effects of SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1RAs do not appear to depend on baseline metformin use. Specifically, approximately 75% of patients were treated with metformin at baseline while a substantial minority were not, there has been no evidence to suggest that cardioprotective effects vary according to baseline metformin, and in EMPA-REG OUTCOME and LEADER there was no evidence that effects of empagliflozin or liraglutide were modified by baseline medication.

### Safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of multiple rising doses of empagliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus [^111Hwgtn]. Diabetes Therapy (2013). Low credibility.

Pharmacodynamics

At all doses, oral administration of empagliflozin increased UGE above the level of placebo, with both the amount and rate of glucose excretion increasing with dose. After a single dose under OGTT conditions (day 1; Fig. 2), the amount of glucose excreted in the urine over 24 h (Ae 0–24) was 46.3 g with 2.5 mg empagliflozin compared with 5.84 g with placebo. There was more than a twofold increase in UGE with the fourfold increase in dose from 2.5 to 10 mg, in contrast with about a 1.2-fold increase in UGE with the fourfold dose increase in dose from 25 to 100 mg. Glucose excretion seemed to plateau after the 10 mg dose, with total cumulative amounts excreted ranging from 77.9 mg to 89.8 g with 10 to 100 mg empagliflozin after a single dose. Similar results were observed after multiple doses with or without OGTT (days 9 and 8, respectively; Fig. 2). Empagliflozin inhibited reabsorption of 39%, 46%, 58%, and 64% of filtered glucose with 2.5, 10, 25, and 100 mg once-daily doses, respectively (Fig. 3). The mean decrease in FPG from baseline (day −1) to day 9 (based on least squares means) ranged from 17.2% to 25.8% with empagliflozin, compared with 12.7% with placebo. The overall decline in FPG was 4.6–13.2% greater with empagliflozin than with placebo (Fig. 4). The decrease in FPG from baseline was significantly different compared to placebo with the 10 mg dose (Fig. 4). A respective decrease in plasma glucose levels was also observed following OGTT immediately after the first dose. The mean decrease in MDG from baseline (based on least squares means) was 24.1–37.0% with empagliflozin, compared with 13.5% for placebo [comparison of day 8 (without OGTT) with baseline (day −2)] (Table 5). The decrease in MDG from baseline was significantly different compared to placebo with the 2.5 and 10 mg doses (Table 7). After OGTT, reductions in plasma glucose levels in empagliflozin groups were greater than in the placebo group. Mean AUEC 1–5 values decreased approximately 22.9–27.5% from baseline with empagliflozin, compared with 14.2% with placebo (Table 8). Serum insulin levels did not change to a relevant degree (data not shown).

Methods

Search Strategy

The first step in our meta-analysis and systematic review was to search the MEDLINE (including PubMed), EMBASE, Cochrane library, the ClinicalTrials.gov registry, and Google Scholar databases for relevant articles using the following search terms 'empagliflozin', 'empagliflozin and diabetes mellitus', 'empagliflozin 10 verus 25 mg', and 'empagliflozin and type 2 diabetes mellitus'. Our search strategy was limited to English language publications and involved only human participants. The reference lists of articles assessed to be suitable for inclusion were also searched for relevant articles.

Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria

Studies were eligible for inclusion in the meta-analysis and systematic review if they met the following criteria: (1) exclusively a randomized controlled trial; (2) treatment with empagliflozin 10 versus 25 mg was compared in patients with T2DM; (3) events of interest were reported in the publication; (4) the follow-up period was ≥ 12 weeks.

Studies were excluded if: (1) they were not a randomized controlled trial; (2) they did not compare treatment with empagliflozin 10 versus 25 mg in patients with T2DM; (3) events of interest were not reported in the trial; (4) they were duplicated studies; (5) they were pooled analyses of trials; (6) the follow-up period was < 12 weeks.

Endpoints and Follow-Up Periods

Seven endpoints were assessed (for details see Table 1):
drug-related adverse effects
adverse events leading to drug discontinuation
serious adverse events (any severe adverse event requiring assistance)
death (due to ADEs)
hypoglycemia (blood glucose level of ≤ 70 mg/dL or ≤ 3.9 mmol/L)
urinary tract infections (UTIs): which were defined as infections of the urinary passage (upper and lower urinary tracts)
genital infections: which were defined as infections of the genitalia especially on the external part

### Safety and efficacy of empagliflozin and diuretic use in patients with heart failure and preserved ejection fraction: a post hoc analysis of the EMPEROR-preserved trial [^114MhzwG]. JAMA Cardiology (2023). High credibility.

Importance

The diuretic effect of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors may result in interaction with background diuretic therapy in patients with heart failure and preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF).

Objective

To assess the safety and efficacy of empagliflozin in combination with background diuretic therapy and the association of empagliflozin with the need for conventional diuretics.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This was a post hoc analysis of the Empagliflozin Outcome Trial in Patients with Chronic Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction (EMPEROR-Preserved). EMPEROR-Preserved was a phase 3, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial conducted from March 2017 to April 2021. Patients with class II to IV heart failure and left ventricular ejection fraction greater than 40% were included. Of 5988 patients enrolled, 5815 (97.1%) had baseline data on diuretic use and were included in this analysis, which was conducted from November 2021 to August 2022.

Interventions

Participants in EMPEROR-Preserved were randomized to empagliflozin or placebo. In this analysis, participants were divided into 4 subgroups: no diuretics and furosemide-equivalent diuretic dose of less than 40 mg, 40 mg, and greater than 40 mg at baseline.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The main outcomes of interest were first hospitalization for heart failure (HHF) or cardiovascular death (CV death) and its components. Association of empagliflozin vs placebo with outcomes by baseline diuretic status (no diuretic vs any dose) and dose (no diuretic, < 40 mg, 40 mg, and > 40mg) was assessed. Association of empagliflozin use with changes in diuretic therapy was also studied.

Results

Among 5815 patients (mean [SD] age, 71.9 [9.4] years; 2594 [44.6%] female) with known baseline diuretic use, 1179 (20.3%) were not taking diuretics, 1725 (29.7%) were taking less than 40 mg, 1772 (30.5%) were taking 40 mg, and 1139 (19.6%) were taking greater than 40 mg. In the placebo arm, patients with higher diuretic doses had worse outcomes. Empagliflozin decreased the risk of HHF or CV death, regardless of background diuretic status (hazard ratio [HR], 0.81; 95% CI, 0.70–0.93] for the diuretic group vs HR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.48–1.06 for the nondiuretic group; P for interaction = .58). Similarly, diuretic status was not associated with changes in improvements in first HHF, total HHF, rate of decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate, and Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire 23 clinical summary score with empagliflozin. Findings were consistent when patients were categorized by diuretic dose. Empagliflozin was associated with a decreased likelihood of diuretic dose escalation (HR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.65–0.84) and an increased likelihood of de-escalation (HR, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.02–1.30). Empagliflozin was associated with an increased risk of volume depletion in patients taking diuretics (HR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.13–1.59).

Conclusion

In this study, treatment with empagliflozin was similar regardless of diuretic use or dose. Empagliflozin use was associated with decreased conventional diuretic dosing.

### Translating recent results from the cardiovascular outcomes trials into clinical practice: recommendations from the central and Eastern European diabetes expert group (CEEDEG) [^116YmgT1]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2017). Low credibility.

Triple therapy

If, after 3 months of dual combination therapy, the HbA1c target is not achieved, the addition of a third therapeutic agent should be considered as second-line combination therapy. Here, the choice of additional agent should largely depend on responses to the existing combination, as well as on the patient's co-morbidities.

For all patients who are already taking metformin plus an SGLT2 inhibitor for its CV risk-reduction benefits, the recommended third agents are, in order of preference, a GLP-1 receptor agonist, a DPP-4 inhibitor or basal insulin. CEEDEG recommended that patients who do not show a decrease in HbA1c level from treatment with empagliflozin should not be simply switched to a GLP-1 receptor agonist, owing to the documented important cardio- and renoprotective effects of empagliflozin.

The agents that are of most benefit to patients with T2D and CVD who are already being treated with metformin and a GLP-1 receptor agonist are either an SGLT2 inhibitor or basal insulin.

For those patients who received a DPP-4 inhibitor with metformin in the first instance, then either the DPP-4 inhibitor should be replaced by a long-acting GLP-1 receptor agonist, or a basal insulin or gliclazide should be prescribed. For patients who received basal insulin with metformin, add an SGLT2 inhibitor, a GLP-1 receptor agonist or a DPP-4 inhibitor, depending on the GFR.

A quadruple combination should be initiated if, after a further 3 months of triple combination therapy, the patient has still not achieved their individual target HbA1c level. For those patients who are taking oral therapies, an injectable therapy should be added: a GLP-1 receptor agonist, basal insulin or mealtime insulin. If the patient is receiving a GLP-1 receptor agonist, then basal insulin should be the next agent. If the patient is already on optimally treated basal insulin, then either a GLP-1 receptor agonist or mealtime insulin should be added, depending on whether they are already taking a GLP-1 receptor agonist. If patients remain refractory to treatment, then consider adding a thiazolidinedione (TZD) or an SGLT2 inhibitor, also depending on the existing therapeutic agents that the patient is receiving.

### Empagliflozin (Jardiance) [^114tRMz8]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Empagliflozin is an inhibitor of SGLT2, the predominant transporter responsible for reabsorption of glucose from the glomerular filtrate back into the circulation. By inhibiting SGLT2, empagliflozin reduces renal reabsorption of filtered glucose and lowers the renal threshold for glucose, and thereby increases urinary glucose excretion.

Empagliflozin also reduces sodium reabsorption and increases the delivery of sodium to the distal tubule. This may influence several physiological functions including, but not restricted to, increasing tubuloglomerular feedback and reducing intraglomerular pressure, lowering both pre- and afterload of the heart and downregulating sympathetic activity.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Urinary Glucose Excretion

In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, urinary glucose excretion increased immediately following a dose of empagliflozin and was maintained at the end of a 4-week treatment period averaging at approximately 64 grams per day with 10 mg empagliflozin and 78 grams per day with 25 mg empagliflozin once daily [see Clinical Studies (14)]. Data from single oral doses of empagliflozin in healthy subjects indicate that, on average, the elevation in urinary glucose excretion approaches baseline by about 3 days for the 10 mg and 25 mg doses.

Urinary Volume

In a 5-day study, mean 24-hour urine volume increase from baseline was 341 mL on Day 1 and 135 mL on Day 5 of empagliflozin 25 mg once daily treatment.

Cardiac Electrophysiology

In a randomized, placebo-controlled, active-comparator, crossover study, 30 healthy subjects were administered a single oral dose of empagliflozin 25 mg, empagliflozin 200 mg (8 times the maximum dose), moxifloxacin, and placebo. No increase in QTc was observed with either 25 mg or 200 mg empagliflozin.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

The pharmacokinetics of empagliflozin has been characterized in healthy volunteers and patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and no clinically relevant differences were noted between the two populations. The steady-state mean plasma AUC and Cmaxwere 1,870 nmol∙h/L and 259 nmol/L, respectively, with 10 mg empagliflozin once daily treatment, and 4,740 nmol∙h/L and 687 nmol/L, respectively, with 25 mg empagliflozin once daily treatment. Systemic exposure of empagliflozin increased in a dose-proportional manner in the therapeutic dose range. Empagliflozin does not appear to have time-dependent pharmacokinetic characteristics. Following once-daily dosing, up to 22% accumulation, with respect to plasma AUC, was observed at steady-state.

### Safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics following 4 weeks' treatment with empagliflozin once daily in patients with type 2 diabetes [^111i3gBK]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

Aim

To investigate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of empagliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes following oral administration of 10, 25 or 100 mg doses once daily over 28 days.

Methods

A total of 78 patients were assigned to empagliflozin 10 mg (n = 16), 25 mg (n = 16) or 100 mg (n = 30) or placebo (n = 16) for 28 days. Assessments included adverse events (AEs) and pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic endpoints.

Results

Empagliflozin exposure increased dose-proportionally over the dose range 10–100 mg and showed linear pharmacokinetics with respect to time. Urinary glucose excretion (UGE) increased from baseline to day 1 by 74, 90 and 81 g with empagliflozin 10, 25 and 100 mg, respectively. The increases in UGE were maintained over 28 days with multiple dosing. Virtually no change in UGE was observed in the placebo group. Significant reductions from baseline in mean daily plasma glucose and fasting plasma glucose were observed with empagliflozin compared with placebo. The incidence of AEs was similar in the empagliflozin and placebo groups (50.0, 56.3 and 66.7% with empagliflozin rising doses and 62.5% with placebo). The most frequently reported AEs were pollakiuria (10.3%), nasopharyngitis (9.0%), constipation (9.0%) and headache (7.7%).

Conclusions

Oral administration of empagliflozin at doses of 10, 25 or 100 mg once daily over 28 days resulted in significant increases in UGE and reductions in blood glucose compared with placebo, and were well tolerated in patients with type 2 diabetes.

14.2 Empagliflozin Cardiovascular Outcomes in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease

EMPA-REG OUTCOME was a multicenter, multinational, randomized, double-blind parallel group trial that compared the risk of experiencing a major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE) between empagliflozin and placebo when these were added to and used concomitantly with standard of care treatments for diabetes mellitus and atherosclerotic CV disease. Concomitant antidiabetic medications were kept stable for the first 12 weeks of the trial. Thereafter, antidiabetic and atherosclerotic therapies could be adjusted, at the discretion of investigators, to ensure participants were treated according to the standard care for these diseases.

A total of 7,020 patients were treated (empagliflozin 10 mg = 2,345; empagliflozin 25 mg = 2,342; placebo = 2,333) and followed for a median of 3.1 years. Approximately 72% of the trial population was White, 22% was Asian, and 5% was Black or African American. The mean age was 63 years and approximately 72% were male.

All patients in the trial had inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus at baseline (HbA1c greater than or equal to 7%). The mean HbA1c at baseline was 8.1% and 57% of participants had diabetes mellitus for more than 10 years. Approximately 31%, 22% and 20% reported a past history of neuropathy, retinopathy and nephropathy to investigators, respectively and the mean eGFR was 74 mL/min/1.73 m2. At baseline, patients were treated with one (~30%) or more (~70%) antidiabetic medications including metformin (74%), insulin (48%), sulfonylurea (43%) and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor (11%).

### Physician perceptions of dose escalation for type 2 diabetes medications in the United States [^116EApBn]. Diabetes Therapy (2024). Medium credibility.

Online Physician Survey

To inform development of the survey, four clinical experts (three physicians with experience treating T2D and one clinical researcher who designs trials of medication for T2D) were interviewed about dose escalation. They were asked about factors they consider when deciding whether to escalate the dose of T2D medication, advantages and disadvantages of dose escalation, and the importance of dose escalation relative to other attributes of medication used to treat T2D. The content of the online survey was based on input provided during these qualitative interviews with physicians and a clinical researcher.

The survey began with instructions for completion. Respondents were instructed to answer the questions while thinking about "the broad range of antihyperglycemic medications for type 2 diabetes, including oral treatment like metformin, empagliflozin, and oral semaglutide; basal and meal-time insulin; and non-insulin injectable medications like liraglutide, injectable semaglutide, and dulaglutide". Then, a series of questions were administered to determine whether the physicians met study inclusion criteria. Physicians who met criteria continued by completing three additional background questions (see physician characteristics in Table 1). The next set of questions assessed the importance of dose escalation relative to other medication attributes. These items asked physicians to select from a list of medication attributes (presented in Tables 2 and 3) to indicate which attributes most commonly prevent patients from reaching treatment goals and which attributes were most commonly perceived as a barrier to prescribing medication.

### Effects of empagliflozin on insulin initiation or intensification in patients with type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease: findings from the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial [^1163ocEh]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

4.3 Estimating lifetime benefits of empagliflozin

While traditional regression methods offer insights regarding treatment effects during the duration of trial follow‐up, preventative therapies such as SGLT‐2 inhibitors are anticipated to be implemented over lifetime use and the need for insulin may accrue over time, especially among younger adults. Given the implications for costs of care and therapeutic complexity, patients and clinicians may be interested in quantifying the long‐term delay in initiation of insulin with SGLT‐2 inhibitors. We adapted actuarial methods to forecast treatment benefits if empagliflozin was used long‐term and if the effects on insulin initiation would be sustained. These age‐based methods and reports of alternative results have been employed to therapeutic effects of non‐pharmacologicand pharmacologic, therapies. The estimated survival projections have been previously validated in a trial of heart failure with known long‐term follow‐up. Among placebo‐treated participants, our estimates of time to insulin initiation appear reasonably well aligned with population‐based studies with long‐term follow‐up. A recent large US electronic health records study used restricted mean survival times to estimate time to insulin initiation among more than 1 million US patients with type 2 diabetes across a broad age range. Estimated time to insulin initiation varied by pathway and sequence of other antihyperglycaemic therapies, but was on average 6.5 years. Other studies similarly estimated median times to insulin intensification of ~6‐8 years among patients with diabetes on multiple oral antihyperglycaemic therapies, which are comparable with our estimates among placebo‐treated older adults in EMPA‐REG OUTCOME.

Young patients with type 2 diabetes face substantial longitudinal risks of disease progression and shortened life expectancy, an especially concerning observation in light of recent trends in type 2 diabetes diagnoses occurring at younger ages. Given greater anticipated duration of empagliflozin use and longer expected survival, we estimate substantial extension in years alive and without need for insulin among younger adults with type 2 diabetes with lifetime use of empagliflozin.

We recognize that many with type 2 diabetes will require insulin for glycaemic control, and that a marked, inappropriate reduction in insulin could unmask deficiency of endogenous insulin, which could in turn potentiate diabetic ketoacidosis. These data are not intended to inform clinical decisions around anticipatory upfront insulin dosing changes upon SGLT‐2 inhibitor initiation.

SGLT2 inhibitors with CV benefit — contraindications, cautions, and adverse effects to monitor — include the following. Contraindications include history of serious hypersensitivity reaction to drug, pregnancy or breastfeeding, on dialysis, eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 (dapagliflozin), ESRD (dapagliflozin and empagliflozin), and severe renal impairment (empagliflozin). Cautions include to discontinue at least 3 days before a planned surgery to prevent postoperative ketoacidosis; if HbA1c is well controlled or there is a history of frequent hypoglycemic events, wean or stop sulfonylurea or glinide and consider reducing total daily insulin dose by ~20% when starting therapy; consider diuretic dose reduction due to intravascular volume contraction; and use with caution in patients with prior amputation, severe peripheral neuropathy, severe peripheral vascular disease, or active diabetic foot ulcers or soft tissue infections; note a possible increased risk of bone fractures with canagliflozin. Adverse effects to monitor are genital fungal infections, urinary tract infections, euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis, and lower limb ulcerations and soft tissue infections.

### Comparative risk evaluation for cardiovascular events associated with dapagliflozin vs. empagliflozin in real-world type 2 diabetes patients: a multi-institutional cohort study [^116ea5Er]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Patients with type 2 diabetes suffer substantial morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular disease. Current medication and lifestyle interventions may not be sufficient to reduce the risk of serious cardiovascular disease outcomes in the primary prevention cohorts of type 2 diabetes. Although the largest absolute benefits of interventions for individual patients are achieved among those with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, the large number of type 2 diabetes patients without a history of major cardiovascular disease makes knowledge about the effects of anti-diabetes medication on first events an additional priority.

Sodium–glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor which decreases glucose re-absorption in the kidney and increases excretion via the urine is the new drug class for type 2 diabetes management with favorable safety profiles, and is recommended as an option for treatment intensification after the failure of metformin. A meta-analysis of three large placebo-controlled cardiovascular outcome trials found that SGLT2 inhibitors reduced major adverse cardiovascular events by 11% (HR: 0.89, 95% CI 0.83–0.96). In addition, compared to incretin-based therapies, including glucagon-like-peptide 1 (GLP-1) agonists and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, SGLT2 inhibitors are associated with lower risks of all-cause and cardiovascular-specific mortality, and occurrence of heart failure and myocardial infarction. Although the direct cardioprotective mechanisms are not fully understood, they may be related to hemodynamic and metabolic actions from SGLT2 inhibitors.

SGLT2 inhibitors, in addition to glycemic controls, also have a positive effect on the cardiometabolic markers, such as body weight, blood pressure and uric acid, and as a result there has been increasing use of SGLT2 inhibitors for the management of type 2 diabetes in clinical practice. However, not all SGLT2 inhibitors share the same pharmacokinetic properties; for example, dapagliflozin with its slower excretion by the kidney exerts its pharmacological effects longer, even after 18 h post-dose, whereas the effects of empagliflozin are markedly attenuated from 12 h post-dose. Due to more stable and longer sodium excretion and osmotic diuresis effects when compared to empagliflozin, dapagliflozin has been reported to reduce the 24-h variability in systolic blood pressures and may be associated with a lower risk for cardiovascular diseases.

Current evidence has shown the beneficial effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on cardiovascular events, but the effects may differ between the individual SGLT2 inhibitors. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine the comparative cardiovascular event risk associated with dapagliflozin vs. empagliflozin in real-world type 2 diabetes patients.

2.4 Treatment inputs

Timing of initiation of a new line of therapy was obtained from published trends in antidiabetes drug use in the US by Montvida et al. 16 This recent study used a large sample (n = 1 023 340) of adults with T2D who initiated an antidiabetes drug (including DPP‐4i and SGLT‐2i) from 2005 to 2016 in the US Centricity Electronic Medical Records database, which records diabetes prevalence (based on diagnostic codes) similar to the national prevalence. 16 A mean rate of initiations for third‐line (12.6 initiations per 100 person‐years) and fourth‐line (3.1 initiations per 100 person‐years) was applied for each treatment pathway. 16 Patients who added insulin were assumed to receive an appropriately titrated dose. Following treatment escalation, patients remained on therapy for life.

In patients without CVD, network meta‐analysis (NMA) of antidiabetic agents informed the treatment‐mediated changes in HbA1c, SBP and weight (Table SA3) in patients initiating empagliflozin and sitagliptin. 17 Efficacy of empagliflozin in patients with CVD was a covariate in each risk equation estimated from the EMPA‐REG OUTCOME CVOT data. 10 Relative efficacy data for sitagliptin from a published indirect treatment comparison (ITC) by Balijepalli et al. using published outcomes from the EMPA‐REG OUTCOME and TECOS CVOTs was applied to each equation. 18 An HR for empagliflozin versus sitagliptin on CV death (HR: 0.60; 95% CI: 0.46‐0.79) and HHF (HR: 0.65; 95% CI: 0.47‐0.90) was obtained. 18 Occurrence of other modelled complications with sitagliptin, where published outcomes from the TECOS trial were not available to inform the ITC, were assumed to resemble placebo from the EMPA‐REG OUTCOME CVOT. Patients who add on insulin were assumed to have the same complication risks they had prior to adding insulin.

AEs that were reported in at least 5% of patients using empagliflozin (urinary tract infection, genital mycotic infection) or sitagliptin (upper respiratory tract infection, nasopharyngitis and headache), per US prescribing labels, were modelled.

Pharmacokinetics

Empagliflozin was rapidly absorbed after oral administration, reaching peak levels between 1.5 and 3 h after a single dose, thereafter, plasma levels declined in a biphasic fashion with a rapid distribution phase and slower elimination phase (Fig. 1). Both AUC and C max increased approximately proportionally with dose over the dose range from 2.5 to 100 mg (Table 6). After repeated dosing, trough concentrations were similar on days 5–8, indicating that steady state was reached by day 5. At steady state, empagliflozin concentration–time profiles showed a trend similar to single dose profiles on day 1 (Fig. 1) [note, 2 patients (1 each from the 10 mg and 100 mg dose groups on day 9) were excluded due to incomplete data or low exposure]. The mean t 1/2 after a single dose ranged from 10.8 (25 mg dose) to 13.6 h (100 mg dose) and was similar at steady state (day 9; range 10.3–18.8 h) (Table 6). Consistent with the drug's half-life, up to 23% accumulation of empagliflozin was observed at steady state. The fe ranged from 12.2% to 18.7% at steady state. On day 1, renal clearance of empagliflozin over 48 h (CL R, 0–48h) was 15.0–29.1 mL/min and at steady state on day 9 (CL R,τ, ss) was 23.5–34.4 mL/min (Table 6). Overall, steady state parameters were similar to single dose parameters, suggesting linear pharmacokinetics with respect to time (Table 6).

Association of Empagliflozin With Changes in Diuretic Therapy After Randomization

Among patients who were not taking diuretics at baseline, empagliflozin was associated with a lesser likelihood of diuretic initiation (HR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.59–0.90; p = 0.004) compared to placebo (Figures 3 and 4). In those who were treated with diuretics at baseline, empagliflozin use was associated with a significantly greater probability of diuretic discontinuation (HR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.15–1.78; p = 0.002) (Figures 2 and 4), and de-escalation (HR, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.02–1.30; p = 0.02) and a decreased likelihood of diuretic dose escalation (HR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.65–0.84; P < .001). Likelihood of diuretic discontinuation, de-escalation, and escalation did not vary by baseline diuretic dose.

### Practical guide to prescribing sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors for cardiologists [^1151z6DZ]. JACC: Heart Failure (2019). Medium credibility.

The sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are a class of glucose-lowering therapies that have been shown to reduce risks of heart failure (HF) events in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) at high-risk for or with cardiovascular disease. The United States Food and Drug Administration has expanded the regulatory label for empagliflozin and canagliflozin for use to lower cardiovascular risk in patients with T2DM and cardiovascular disease. SGLT2 inhibitors are being actively studied in the treatment of patients with HF, including in those without diabetes mellitus. Despite the accumulating data supporting this class of therapies in HF prevention, cardiologists infrequently prescribe SGLT2 inhibitors, potentially due to lack of familiarity with their use. We provide an up-to-date practical guide highlighting important elements for treatment initiation, dosing, anticipated adverse effects, and barriers to uptake.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus [^115o2419]. VA/DoD (2023). High credibility.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus with heart failure — SGLT-2 inhibitors to prevent hospitalization: For adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart failure, we recommend a sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor to prevent hospital admissions for heart failure. The Work Group systematically reviewed evidence related to this recommendation, categorized it as Reviewed, New-added, stated that the Work Group's confidence in the quality of the evidence was high, and found that the benefits of SGLT-2 inhibitors in reducing hospitalization for heart failure (HHF) for patients with T2DM and HF outweighed the potential harm. Guideline-directed medical therapy includes SGLT-2 inhibitors as part of an initial "four pillar" approach for patients with heart failure along with angiotensin receptor–neprilysin inhibitors, beta blockers, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, and adding an SGLT-2 inhibitor to a regimen in a patient already achieving glycemic goals might require de-escalation of other medications to limit the risk of hypoglycemia. Evidence cited notes empagliflozin has been shown effective in patients with reduced and preserved ejection fraction and that dapagliflozin similarly reduced the rate of heart failure outcomes, while some systematic reviews suggest that glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) might also reduce HHF but the overall impact on HHF is likely minimal without albiglutide, which is no longer marketed in the U.S. Implementation should consider patient factors and tolerability described here, including urinary frequency (especially with coexisting bladder or prostate conditions), a history of recurrent or severe genitourinary infections, and in older patients on other antihypertensives or diuretics or those with systolic heart failure the possibility of symptomatic hypotension or volume depletion that might require de-escalation or discontinuation of therapy.

Safety and Tolerability

In total, 24 (50.0%) patients experienced AEs during the treatment period. No AEs were reported in the 1-week post-treatment period. The frequency of AEs was 52.8% in patients receiving empagliflozin treatment and 41.7% with placebo. The most frequently reported AE was headache, reported by 4 patients (8.3%) during the treatment period, occurring in 0–2 patients per group (Table 2). There were no fatalities or serious AEs. A total of 16 patients (33.3%) experienced AEs that the investigator considered related to study medication, but there were no treatment-related differences in their frequency. The most common investigator-defined treatment-related AEs were headache, diarrhea, and hypoglycemia. Three patients in the empagliflozin treatment group experienced hypoglycemic events, defined as blood glucose levels < 3.5 mmol/L (< 63 mg/dL), but all of them occurred within 5 h of OGTT administration. These events were considered by the investigator to be moderate in intensity, but all patients recovered following therapy. Two patients experienced AEs that led to discontinuation of study treatment [1 patient in the placebo group had an increase in hepatic enzymes (maximum alanine transaminase level of 335 U/L) considered to be of severe intensity and 1 patient treated with empagliflozin experienced cellulitis (phlegmon of the lower left arm) considered to be of moderate intensity, which the investigator did not believe to be related to the study medication]. No urinary tract or genital tract infections were reported. There were no findings of clinical significance in the laboratory clinical evaluations (including electrolytes and lipid parameters; Table 3), 12-lead ECG, vital signs, weight, or waist circumference. No major differences in total urine volume were observed between the empagliflozin and placebo groups. On day 8, the mean volume of urine collected ranged from 2.36 to 4.08 L following empagliflozin dosing, compared with a mean of 3.23 L for the placebo group. Similarly, there were no changes to micturition frequency after empagliflozin administration compared with placebo under the controlled fluid intake conditions of the trial (Table 4). Creatinine clearance was similar in all dose groups except for the 2.5 mg empagliflozin dose group at 166 h (Table 5). In this group, two patients had high derived creatinine clearance values in urine fractions collected over a 2-h period pre-dose on day 8 (1,392 mL/min × 1.73 m 2 and 1,124 mL/min × 1.73 m 2 change from baseline), based on urinary creatinine concentrations of 251 mg/dL in a volume of 670 mL and 84.1 mg/dL in a volume of 2,115 mL of urine, respectively, and plasma creatinine concentrations of 0.68 mg/dL and 0.94 mg/dL, respectively. This resulted in a mean (SD) change from baseline in derived creatinine clearance of 360 (620) mL/min × 1.73 m 2 in the 2.5 mg empagliflozin group at 166 h, compared with −12.1 (54.6) mL/min × 1.73 m 2 for the placebo group (Table 5).

Comparison of the ADEs Associated with 10 Versus 25 mg Empagliflozin During a Longer Follow-Up Period of ≥ 52 Weeks in Patients with T2DM

Analysis of the data on treatment with 10 versus 25 mg empagliflozin during a relatively longer follow-up period of ≥ 52 weeks revealed that there were no significant differences in drug-related adverse effects (OR 1.05, 95% CI 0.91–1.22; P = 0.50, I² = 0%), adverse events leading to drug discontinuation (OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.84–1.13; P = 0.73, I² = 0%), serious adverse events (OR 1.07, 95% CI 0.96–1.19; P = 0.24, I² = 0%), death (OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.61–1.11; P = 0.20, I² = 0%), hypoglycemic episode (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.88–1.13; P = 0.99, I² = 0%), UTIs (OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.85–1.12; P = 0.70, I² = 26%), and genital infections (OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.75–1.15; P = 0.51, I² = 15%) between the T2DM patients receiving 10 mg empagliflozin and those receiving 25 mg empagliflozin, as shown in Fig. 6.

### Pharmacodynamic effects of single and multiple doses of empagliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes [^114sBUsF]. Clinical Therapeutics (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose

Our aim was to investigate the effects of the sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor empagliflozin on urinary and serum glucose and electrolytes, urinary volume, osmolality, and the renin-angiotensin system in patients with type 2 diabetes.

Methods

In an open-label study, 22 patients receiving metformin (median age 56 years; range 40–65 years) received empagliflozin 25 mg once daily for 5 days. Food, fluid, and sodium intake were standardized for 3 days before and during treatment.

Findings

Twenty patients completed treatment. After single and multiple doses of empagliflozin, mean (SE) changes from baseline in 24-hour urinary glucose excretion were 463.3 (57.3) mmol/d and 599.5 (60.0) mmol/d, respectively (83.5 [10.3] g/d and 108.0 [10.8] g/d, respectively) (both P < 0.001), and in fasting serum glucose concentration were -1.8 (0.4) mmol/L and -1.1 (0.3) mmol/L, respectively (both P < 0.001). After a single dose, mean (SE) change from baseline in urine sodium excretion was 45.3 (9.6) mmol/d (P < 0.001), and in urine volume was 341.0 (140.5) g/d (P = 0.025), but there were no changes compared with baseline in either parameter after multiple doses. There were no changes in plasma renin or serum aldosterone with single or multiple doses of empagliflozin. There was a nonsignificant reduction in weight after a single dose of empagliflozin and a mean (SE) change of -1.4 (0.5) kg after multiple doses (P = 0.020).

Implications

Empagliflozin 25 mg increased urinary glucose excretion and decreased serum glucose and weight with transient natriuresis and increases in urine volume, without significant changes in the renin-angiotensin system. Clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT01276288.

### 2020 expert consensus decision pathway on novel therapies for cardiovascular risk reduction in patients with type 2 diabetes: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^115ovf5a]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2020). High credibility.

Type 2 diabetes with cardiovascular disease — background therapy and decision principles: Most patients with T2D and CV disease will continue metformin together with an SGLT2 inhibitor and/or GLP-1RA with proven CV benefit, and decisions to initiate an SGLT2 inhibitor (for CV or kidney risk reduction) or a GLP-1RA (for CV risk reduction) should not be contingent on HbA1c levels. If an SGLT2 or GLP-1RA is added to a well-controlled T2D regimen, dose adjustment of background medications may be required to avoid hypoglycemia in the context of insulin, sulfonylurea, or glinide therapy, particularly in patients at or near glycemic goals. Efforts to achieve glycemic and blood pressure targets and to adhere to lipid, antiplatelet, antithrombotic, and smoking cessation guidelines should continue after addition of an SGLT2 inhibitor or GLP-1RA.

### 2024 ACC expert consensus decision pathway for treatment of heart Failure with reduced ejection Fraction: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^114xodmp]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

Sodium–glucose cotransporter (SGLT) inhibitors in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) — renal function thresholds and early eGFR changes are detailed: clinical trials typically used lower estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) cutoffs of 20 to 30 mL/min/1.73 m2, with recent labels listing lower limits of 25 mL/min/1.73 m2 for dapagliflozin and sotagliflozin and no lower bound cutoff for empagliflozin; after initiation, a drop in eGFR is expected and clinicians should not necessarily adjust or discontinue medications solely for this reason; in trials of dapagliflozin and empagliflozin, participants with an eGFR below 20 mL/min/1.73 m2 continued treatment with considerable benefits, whereas in studies of sotagliflozin the drug was discontinued if eGFR dropped below 15 mL/min/1.73 m2.

Treatment Duration/Switch to 2nd Line

The EMPA-REG OUTCOME and other CVOT were designed to assess the effect of the investigational drug versus placebo as an add-on to background therapy. This background therapy is a combination of other glucose-lowering drugs (such as sulfonylureas, metformin, GLP-1, glitazone, glinide and insulin) that were already administered at study initiation or escalated over the study duration. The background therapy was therefore diverse and evolving over time in the CVOT (Fig. 1).

Fig. 1
Lifetime survival of all therapies

Nevertheless, as the time horizon for this analysis was 50 years, it would be inappropriate and unrealistic to apply the reported combined therapies throughout the time horizon. As such, treatment switch was programmed when an 8.5% HbA1c threshold was reached. As background insulin regimen was already provided to half of patients at week 164 of the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial (50% in emplagliflozin vs. 58% in placebo), basal-bolus insulin therapy was considered to be the most plausible treatment escalation regimen. HbA1c progression was programmed to be exactly as described by the different CVOT and their follow-up period. After that, it was linearly extrapolated (see the evolution of HbA1c per treatment arm in Fig. 2). Treatment effects on risk factors and dose of basal bolus insulin were taken from Riddle et al. High dose mealtime insulin (57 IU) was combined with high dose glargine (94 IU).

Fig. 2
Progression of HbA1c over time

Before treatment escalation, mortality, CV and renal outcomes in the CDM are predicted as described in the calibration process. Thus, they matched the event rates as reported in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial and those determined with relative treatment efficacy derived from indirect comparison. After treatment escalation, the standard UKPDS 82 RE were applied to predict mortality and CV outcomes. The default CDM probabilities for developing renal disease are also applied.

Management Data

Clinical management data include the proportion of patients on preventive medications such as aspirin, statins and angiotensin-blocking agents, undergoing routine screening for diabetic complications and the sensitivity and specificity of the screening tests performed.

17	PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide).

Diabetic Ketoacidosis in Patients with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus and Other Ketoacidosis

In patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, inform them that using JARDIANCE can increase their risk of life-threatening diabetic ketoacidosis and that fatal ketoacidosis has occurred. For all other patients, inform them that JARDIANCE can cause potentially fatal ketoacidosis and that type 2 diabetes mellitus and pancreatic disorders (e.g., history of pancreatitis or pancreatic surgery) are risk factors.

Educate all patients on precipitating factors (such as insulin dose reduction or missed insulin doses, infection, reduced caloric intake, ketogenic diet, surgery, dehydration, and alcohol abuse) and symptoms of ketoacidosis (including nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, tiredness, and labored breathing). Inform patients that blood glucose may be normal even in the presence of ketoacidosis.

Advise patients that they may be asked to monitor ketones. If symptoms of ketoacidosis occur, instruct patients to discontinue JARDIANCE and seek medical attention immediately [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Volume Depletion

Inform patients that symptomatic hypotension may occur with JARDIANCE and advise them to contact their healthcare provider if they experience such symptoms [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Inform patients that dehydration may increase the risk for hypotension, and to maintain adequate fluid intake.

Serious Urinary Tract Infections

Inform patients of the potential for urinary tract infections, which may be serious. Provide them with information on the symptoms of urinary tract infections. Advise them to seek medical advice if such symptoms occur [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

Hypoglycemia

Inform patients that hypoglycemia has been reported when JARDIANCE is used with insulin secretagogues or insulin. Hypoglycemia may occur in pediatric patients regardless of concomitant antidiabetic treatment. Educate patients or caregivers on the signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

### Treatment of diabetes in older adults: an endocrine society* clinical practice guideline [^112t5f7s]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). High credibility.

Endocrine Society — sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors in CKD: SGLT2 inhibitors generally become less effective as GFR decreases, and because of a small increase in adverse events related to intravascular volume contraction, no more than 100 mg once daily of canagliflozin should be used in patients with an eGFR of 45 to < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2. Canagliflozin, empagliflozin, and ertugliflozin should be stopped if the eGFR is < 45 mL/min/1.73 m2, and dapagliflozin should be stopped at 60 mL/min/1.73 m2, primarily because of a decrease in efficacy. Interestingly, empagliflozin and canagliflozin have been shown to delay the progression of CKD.

### Basic and clinical pharmaco-therapeutics of SGLT2 inhibitors: a contemporary update [^116NhdTb]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

In 2015, the EMPA-REG OUTCOME study demonstrated significant benefits of empagliflozin for CV mortality, as well as major adverse CV events, in patients with T2DM and CV disease. These CV outcomes resulted in significant mortality benefit in these patients. All types of CV deaths were reduced with empagliflozin; more prominent absolute benefits were observed for HF-related deaths and sudden deaths. The post hoc analyses of EMPA-REG OUTCOME demonstrated consistent CV mortality benefit with empagliflozin, irrespective of prior CV events (myocardial infarction or stroke), HF burden, chronic kidney disease (CKD), baseline HbA1c level, control of multiple CV risk factors or background use of metformin. Moreover, a discordance between CV and glycaemic effects was evident; CV mortality benefit extended up to stage 3-b of CKD (eGFR up to 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2). Further, unlike the dose-dependent incremental glycaemic effects of empagliflozin, both the clinical doses (10 mg and 25 mg) demonstrated equivalent CV benefits. With these observations, and the study design based on glycaemic equipoise, the CV mortality benefit was understood to be unrelated to the glucose-lowering effect of empagliflozin. Subsequently, the CANVAS program also demonstrated reduction in risk of major adverse CV events with canagliflozin, in patients with T2DM and CV disease. This benefit was not evident in patients without known CV disease, who harboured multiple CV risk factors, in the CANVAS program. The DECLARE-TIMI 58 study did not demonstrate significant reduction in major adverse CV events or CV mortality with dapagliflozin, in patients with T2DM and CV disease, or with multiple CV risk factors. All these CVOTs demonstrated consistent improvements in HF-related outcomes with SGLT2i agents. These HF benefits were observed in patients with or without prior HF.

### Practical outpatient management of worsening chronic heart failure [^111hFySw]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2022). Medium credibility.

In the last 2 years, sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have been shown to improve HF‐related outcomes. These medications induce significant natriuresis and glucosuria, particularly when combined with loop diuretics (Figure 1), resulting in reduction in blood and plasma volume. Importantly, SGLT2 inhibitors have a proximal effect, leading to a shift of tubular fluid from the proximal to the distal segments of the nephron. This shift can increase natriuresis depending on the sodium‐retaining capacity of these distal segments (i.e. volume status, neurohumoral activation, use of diuretics). This natriuretic effect is not associated with any significant electrolyte wasting, renal dysfunction or neurohormonal activation. Importantly, the efficacy, tolerability and safety profile of SGLT2 inhibitors is unaffected by concomitant treatment (or dosage) with a conventional diuretic. Most patients in the DAPA‐HF trial did not undergo a change in diuretic dose during follow‐up, and the mean daily dose of diuretics did not differ between the dapagliflozin and placebo groups. In line with these results, in a moderately‐sized trial study, Boorsma et al.reported that empagliflozin at a daily dose of 10 mg increased plasma osmolarity without affecting fractional sodium, chloride excretion, or urinary osmolality. However, two studies conversely reported favourable decongestion effects with higher doses of empagliflozin. Despite natriuresis being unchanged following empagliflozin initiation in the aforementioned studies, diuresis did increase in the study by Mordi et al.whereas fractional sodium excretion increased in the Griffin et al. study. Lastly, in keeping with the impact of neprilysin inhibition on pulmonary artery pressures, Nassif and colleagues similarly reported an average 12‐week treatment effect of −1.7 mmHg (p = 0.02) on mean pulmonary artery pressures among patients treated with empagliflozin versus placebo. Trials testing use of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with diuretic resistance are ongoing (DAPA‐RESIST, NCT04860011). In addition, SGLT2 inhibitors were reported recently to be favourably associated with better overall clinical outcome in the setting of WHF in the EMPULSE trial. This positive result in acute HF, in which congestion is a key issue, parallels the results reported in the SOLOIST‐WHF trial, where the rate of the primary event in patients randomized to sotagliflozin was 30% lower than in the placebo group (HR 0.67; 95% confidence interval 0.52–0.85; p < 0.001). The efficacy and safety of dapagliflozin in acute HF will further be evaluated in the ongoing DICTATE‐AHF trial. Of note, SGLT2 inhibitors appear effective in patients with HFpEF: in the EMPEROR‐Preserved trial, an impressive 27% reduction in the total number of hospitalizations for HF was reported in the empagliflozin group.

### Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties and tolerability of single-and multiple-dose once-daily empagliflozin, a sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor, in Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus [^111kd16A]. Clinical Therapeutics (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

The aim of this study was to investigate the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties and tolerability of the oral once-daily sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor empagliflozin, given in single and multiple 10 and 25 mg doses in Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).

Methods

In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study, Chinese patients with T2DM were randomly assigned to receive a single dose of empagliflozin 10 or 25 mg or placebo on day 1 and once daily on days 3 to 9.

Findings

A total of 24 patients were enrolled (14 men, 10 women; median age, 53.5 years; empagliflozin 10 mg, n = 9; empagliflozin 25 mg, n = 9; and placebo, n = 6). After both single- and multiple-dose administration, empagliflozin 10 and 25 mg were rapidly absorbed, reaching peak plasma concentrations within 1 to 1.5 hours (median), with plasma levels declining biphasically. Empagliflozin exposure increased roughly dose proportionally between 10 and 25 mg. Mean terminal elimination half-life values at steady state were 13.9 and 12.1 hours with empagliflozin 10 and 25 mg, respectively. Mean (SD) changes from baseline in 24-hour urinary glucose excretion (UGE) on day 1 were +87.7 (22.9) and +82.8 (18.8) g with empagliflozin 10 and 25 mg, respectively, compared with -1.0 (2.8) g with placebo, and on day 9 were +95.8 (24.1), +82.6 (34.8) g with empagliflozin 10 and 25 mg, respectively, compared with -4.1 (6.4) g with placebo. Mean (SD) changes from baseline in fasting plasma glucose (FPG) on day 2 were -18.7 (17.2) mg/dL and -25.8 (19.6) mg/dL with empagliflozin 10 and 25 mg, respectively, compared with -4.2 (15.2) mg/dL with placebo, and on day 9, were -25.6 (20.7) mg/dL and -31.4 (26.9) mg/dL with empagliflozin 10 and 25 mg, respectively, compared to -3.7 (7.5) mg/dL with placebo. On day 10, mean changes in weight were -1.1, -1.6, and +0.5 kg with empagliflozin 10 and 25 mg and placebo, respectively. Overall, empagliflozin 10 and 25 mg had safety profiles similar to that of placebo. There were no reports of hypoglycemia, urinary tract infections, or genital infections.

Implications

Results with single and multiple doses of empagliflozin 10 and 25 mg suggest linear pharmacokinetic properties in Chinese patients with T2DM, with a safety profile similar to that of placebo. Empagliflozin treatment was associated with increases in UGE and reductions in FPG compared with placebo. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01316341.

### 2020 expert consensus decision pathway on novel therapies for cardiovascular risk reduction in patients with type 2 diabetes: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^114v9fYd]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2020). High credibility.

Type 2 diabetes cardiovascular risk reduction — initiation of sodium–glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors or glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA): We recommend initiating a patient-clinician discussion about SGLT2 inhibitor and/or GLP-1RA therapy at a follow-up visit for patients with T2D who have or who are at very high risk for clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), heart failure (HF), and/or diabetic kidney disease (DKD). An SGLT2 inhibitor with demonstrated cardiovascular (CV) benefit is recommended for patients with T2D and HF, especially heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), or who are at high risk of developing HF, DKD, clinically evident ASCVD, or combinations of these. A GLP-1RA with demonstrated CV benefit is recommended for patients with established or at very high risk for ASCVD. Patients with T2D may become eligible for these therapies if they are subsequently hospitalized or diagnosed with ASCVD, HF, and/or DKD, although hospitalized patients were not included in most CV outcome trials and inpatient formularies may not include these agents. Outpatient adherence after an acute CV event can be favorably influenced by initiation at discharge. CV specialists should consider periodic screening for T2D by measuring HbA1c at guideline-recommended intervals (e.g., annually in patients with prediabetes). Patients with ASCVD or at high risk of ASCVD and/or HF should consider initiation of an SGLT2 inhibitor or GLP-1RA with demonstrated CV benefit irrespective of HbA1c levels. Although canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, and empagliflozin have differences in FDA-approved CV indications, they appear to have broadly similar CV and renal benefits, and the choice of an individual agent should be made after appropriate patient-clinician discussion of benefits and potential risks.

### The role of sodium-glucose Co-transporter 2 inhibitors in the treatment of type 2 diabetes [^116brMHW]. Clinical Therapeutics (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

Diabetes is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by hyperglycemia that results from insulin resistance, diminished or absent insulin secretion, or both. Approximately one-half of patients with diabetes fail to achieve acceptable glycemic control. Consequently, morbidity and mortality associated with diabetes is high, resulting from complications such as cardiovascular disease and nephropathy. The sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are a new class of medications for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. This article provides an overview of efficacy and safety data for the SGLT2 inhibitors and outlines their role in the management of diabetes.

Methods

Relevant articles were identified through searches of PubMed and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts by using the key terms canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, empagliflozin, and sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitor. A review of bibliographies of retrieved articles was also performed to identify additional references. All identified trials published in English and that involved the efficacy and safety of SGLT2 inhibitors in the treatment of type 2 diabetes were reviewed.

Findings

The SGLT2 inhibitors improve glucose control by increasing urinary glucose excretion. Effectiveness is decreased in the presence of renal dysfunction. These agents are efficacious as monotherapy and add-on therapy for patients with type 2 diabetes uncontrolled on metformin, sulfonylureas, insulin, and other antihyperglycemic combinations. The SGLT2 inhibitors lower glycosylated hemoglobin by 0.5% to 1% and fasting plasma glucose by ~15 to 35 mg/dL, depending on the agent and the dosage used, and are also associated with modest reductions in weight (-1.5 to -3.5 kg) and systolic blood pressure (-3 to -5 mm Hg). Genital mycotic infections and increased urination, owing to the mechanism of action, are the most common adverse effects. In general, the class is well tolerated, and the risk of hypoglycemia is low.

Implications

With their unique mechanism of action and good safety and tolerability profiles, the SGLT2 inhibitors are an important addition to existing treatments for type 2 diabetes. Because of the lack of data with this class of drugs when current treatment guidelines for diabetes were published, the SGLT2 inhibitors are recommended as second- or third-line therapies for diabetes. Forthcoming data on the long-term efficacy and safety profile of these agents should help to solidify the role of SGLT2 inhibitors in the management of diabetes.

### SGLT2 inhibitors as adjunctive therapy for type 1 diabetes: balancing benefits and risks [^113vJezQ]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2019). High credibility.

Sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have several beneficial effects in patients with type 2 diabetes, including glucose lowering, weight loss, blood pressure lowering, and a reduced risk of major adverse cardiovascular events. To address high unmet medical need via improved glycaemic control, several clinical trials have been done to assess the efficacy and safety of SGLT2 inhibitors in combination with insulin therapy in patients with type 1 diabetes. In this Personal View, we summarise data from eight clinical trials of canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, empagliflozin, and sotagliflozin in patients with type 1 diabetes. HbA 1c -lowering efficacy was greatest at 8–12 weeks of therapy, but the magnitude of HbA 1c lowering waned with longer duration of treatment (up to 52 weeks). Data are not yet available to establish for how long glycaemic efficacy could be sustained during long-term therapy in patients with type 1 diabetes. Moreover, SGLT2 inhibitor therapy induces serious adverse events, including a roughly six-times increased risk of diabetic ketoacidosis. The US Food and Drug Administration estimated that one additional case of ketoacidosis will occur for every 26 patient-years of exposure of patients with type 1 diabetes to sotagliflozin therapy. Assuming a case mortality of 0·4%, this estimate translates into 16 additional deaths per year per 100000 patients with type 1 diabetes undergoing treatment. These considerations raise important questions about the risk-to-benefit profile of SGLT2 inhibitors when used as adjunctive therapy in patients with type 1 diabetes.

Results

Study sample, demographics and baseline characteristics

Of the 39 young people screened, 27 were randomized (nine participants to the 5‐mg dose group, eight participants to the 10‐mg dose group, and 10 participants to the 25‐mg dose group). All randomized participants received study medication and completed the trial.

As shown in Table 1, the demographic and clinical characteristics of the three treatment groups were generally similar; however, compared with the other two groups, weight and BMI were higher in the 10‐mg dose group, and baseline fasting plasma glucose and urinary glucose excretion were lowest in the 25‐mg dose group. The 10‐mg dose group included three American Indian/Alaska Native participants (37.5%) and only one white participant (12.5%), while both the 5‐mg dose group and the 25‐mg dose group contained no American Indian/Alaska Native and five (55.6%) and six (60.0%) white participants, respectively.

Table 1
Demographic data and baseline characteristics of participants

Pharmacokinetic outcomes

After single‐dose administration, empagliflozin was rapidly absorbed in the participants of all three dose groups. Maximum peak plasma concentrations were reached after ~1.5 h (Table 2). Empagliflozin plasma concentrations increased with increasing dose (Fig. 1 a, b) but not in a dose‐proportional manner. The mean values of the pharmacokinetic characteristics of empagliflozin are shown in Table 2. Terminal plasma half‐life values were in the range of 7.03 h to 8.09 h for all empagliflozin doses. One participant in the empagliflozin 5 mg group had two abnormally high empagliflozin plasma concentrations at 8 h and 48 h post dose (approximately eightfold and 32‐fold above the respective values of the others in this dose group), while the remainder of the plasma concentrations of this participant were within the expected range (Fig. S2). Although these two values were physiologically implausible, they were included in the final analysis because no error relating to the study conduct or the bioanalytical method was found. A sensitivity analysis excluding these two values was performed in addition to the final analyses. Overall, the difference in the results of the main analysis and sensitivity analysis in empagliflozin plasma exposure amounted to < 20%. The mean terminal half‐life was not different between the two analyses; however, the median observed time from dosing until maximum concentration was 1.50 h in the main analysis and 1.05 h in the sensitivity analysis (Table S1)

Recognized side effects are not greater at lower eGFR, initial reports of higher rates of lower extremity amputation with canagliflozin have not been substantiated, SGLT2is tend to lower serum potassium, and the risk of AKI is actually reduced by 25% with SGLT2i use in persons with T2D.

SGLT2 inhibitor options with proven benefits are canagliflozin 100 mg, dapagliflozin 10 mg, and empagliflozin 10 mg, with education on sick day protocol, perioperative care, and foot care, and follow-up includes assessing adverse effects, reviewing knowledge, and anticipating an acute drop in eGFR, which is generally not a reason to stop the SGLT2 inhibitor. For glycemia, hypoglycemia risk factors include insulin or sulfonylurea use, history of severe hypoglycemia, and HbA1c at or below goal; if high, education includes hypoglycemia symptoms and glycemia monitoring and consider insulin/sulfonylurea dose reduction, with follow-up to ask about hypoglycemia and reduce sulfonylurea or insulin if needed. For volume, volume depletion risk factors include concurrent diuretic use, tenuous volume status, and history of AKI; if high, education includes volume depletion symptoms and consideration of diuretic dose reduction, with follow-up to re-assess volume and reduce concomitant diuretic if needed.

### Effects of empagliflozin on insulin initiation or intensification in patients with type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease: findings from the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial [^115WhUsr]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

4.4 Study limitations

This post hoc analysis is subject to certain limitations. While analyses of primary and secondary clinical outcomes by baseline insulin use were prespecified, assessment of subsequent insulin intensification as studied here was exploratory. Insulin use and dosing was assessed during scheduled or unscheduled visits, and detailed information regarding treatment patterns was not available between visits. Given the strict inclusion and exclusion criteria of the trial, together with study procedures with frequent study visits, these data may not be generalizable to all populations, especially patients without ASCVD and those with lesser health access. No data were available regarding insulin type, use pattern, or complexity of regimens.

In a clinical trial, with regular participant visits, and a focus on glycaemia, it is probable that insulin initiation was more frequent than would be expected in real‐world clinical practice. Scheduled ambulatory visits would not however be anticipated to be unbalanced between treatment arms in a blinded trial. However, there may have been an imbalance in unscheduled visitations that may have provided additional opportunities for treatment intensification. SGLT‐2 inhibitors are known to reduce all‐cause hospitalizations, and in particular hospitalizations for heart failure, in at‐risk patients with type 2 diabetes. Hospitalizations occurred more frequently in placebo‐treated participants in EMPA‐REG OUTCOME and may represent important sites of care in which insulin is initiated or dosing is intensified.

The actuarial methods assume consistent treatment adherence and magnitude of treatment effects as observed during the trial over lifetime use. Because β‐cell dysfunction continues after the diagnosis of diabetes, it is possible that any insulin‐sparing effects of empagliflozin would be lost over time. Moreover, interval non‐adherence might also be anticipated to attenuate projected gains in insulin‐free survival. Finally, the long‐term actuarial analysis required accounting of competing risks of mortality and thus consideration of a composite of time to insulin initiation or death, despite the two components occurring with different frequency and of unequal patient importance.

Despite these limitations, these data from a large cardiovascular outcomes trial represent the most comprehensive and detailed evaluation of the effects of SGLT‐2 inhibition on insulin initiation or intensification, extending prior concordant observations with another member of this therapeutic class.

### Is the stepping-down approach a better option than multiple daily injections in obese patients with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes on advanced insulin therapy? [^114cg82Q]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

2.3 Procedures

All participants in both groups made a total of 3 visits over a 16‐week period. The 2nd visit was at week 4 and 3rd visit at week 16 after initial visit. At each visit, all patients had blood test for A1c, CMP, CBC, fasting lipid and measurements of body weight, height, blood pressure and heart rate, answered adverse reaction questions and completed the Diabetes Medications Satisfaction (DM‐SAT) Questionnaire form.

At first visit, the following changes were made in intervention group:

All prandial insulin injections (Humalog, Novolog, Apidra, Novolin R or Humulin R) were discontinued.
Basal insulin (NPH, Lantus, Levemir, Toujeo or Tresiba) were continued at 80% of the home dose. The dose was gradually increased until the patient is back on the home dose (the dose that the patient has been taking at home prior to the enrolment) or fasting BG of 80–130 mg/dl was achieved by using the self‐titration regimen (Appendix 1).
If the patient was on premixed insulin 2–3 times daily, it was switched to a basal insulin alone and Glargine was given at 40% of total daily dose of premixed insulin. The dose was gradually increased until fasting BG of 80–130 mg/dl is achieved by using the self‐titration regimen (Appendix 1).
Metformin at home dose was continued, but other noninsulin diabetes medications were discontinued. If the patient was not on metformin, then metformin ER was started at 500 mg daily with a meal for 2 weeks and then 1000 mg daily as a maintenance dose if tolerated.
Both SGLT2i, empagliflozin 10 mg or 12.5 mg once daily, and GLP1 RA, dulaglutide 0.75 mg subcutaneously once weekly, were added to metformin and a basal insulin.

### Cost-effectiveness analysis of empagliflozin in comparison to sitagliptin and saxagliptin based on cardiovascular outcome trials in patients with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease [^116jFE64]. Diabetes Therapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The current analysis based on the CDM and CVOT evidence showed that, in patients with an established risk of CVD, empagliflozin + SoC is cost-effective versus sitagliptin + SoC and saxagliptin + SoC. It showed that empagliflozin + SoC provides additional LYs and QALYs, for an additional cost below 3200 GBP. The incremental CE ratios were below the NICE WTP threshold of 20,000 GBP per QALY (Fig. 4).

A number of key assumptions were incorporated into the model. First, despite the fact that treatment guidelines recommend HbA1c thresholds of 7% or 7.5% for treatment switching, a threshold of 8.5% was applied. The reason for this is that the baseline HbA1c value was 8.07% and the treatment effect with empagliflozin was only 0.58%; therefore, testing a lower threshold would not be inappropriate because patients would switch to the next treatment line before the 3-year therapy of the trial was complete. Additionally, in the trial, there were several treatment adaptations that are taken into account in our HbA1c progression and costing.

Second, as previously discussed, patients were receiving a broad mix of therapies in CVOT, continuous adaptations to treatment were required to keep HbA1c low according local guidelines, and thus reflected in the CVO outcomes. Given the combined therapies administered to patients in the CVOT, a high dose of basal-bolus insulin was chosen as the next line therapy.

Thirdly, the extent of CV benefit beyond the study follow-up period remains uncertain. In the base case analysis, the benefit is applied over 8 years as a consequence of the 8.5% HbA1c switch threshold. To evaluate the impact on results, separate scenario analyses were conducted: evaluating the effects of treatments at a shorter time horizon (= 5 years), applying CVOT benefits for 3 years only (= trial follow-up period), applying treatment intensification at an HbA1c threshold of 9%; and excluding insulin costs from therapy costs. All analyses confirmed the cost-effectiveness profile of emplagliflozin + SoC against sitagliptin and saxagliptin as add-on to SoC.

### Effects of empagliflozin on risk for cardiovascular death and heart failure hospitalization across the spectrum of heart failure risk in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME® trial [^116btBfo]. European Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Aims

Empagliflozin reduced the risk of cardiovascular (CV) death and heart failure (HF) hospitalizations in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and established CV disease (CVD) in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME® trial. We investigated whether the benefit of empagliflozin was observed across the spectrum of HF risk.

Methods and Results

Seven thousand and twenty patients with T2D (HbA1c 7–10% and eGFR > 30mL/min/1.73 m2) were treated with empagliflozin 10 or 25mg, or placebo once daily and followed for median 3.1years. In patients without HF at baseline (89.9%), we derived the 5-year risk for incident HF using the 9-variable Health ABC HF Risk score [classified as low-to-average (< 10%), high (10–20%), and very high (≥ 20%)]. Overall, 67.2% of the population had low-to-average, 24.2% high, and 5.1% very high 5-year HF risk. Across these groups, the effect on CV death and HF hospitalization with empagliflozin was consistent [hazard ratio 0.71 (95% confidence interval: 0.52, 0.96), 0.52 (0.36, 0.75), and 0.55 (0.30, 1.00), respectively]. Effects on CV death in the ostensibly highest HF risk group (HF at baseline and/or incident HF during the trial) in whom 37.9% of the overall CV deaths occurred, was also beneficial [0.67 (0.47, 0.97)], yet, similar benefits were seen in the lower risk patients.

Conclusion

In patients with T2D and established CVD, a sizeable proportion without HF at baseline are at high or very high risk for HF outcomes, indicating the need for active case finding in this patient population. Empagliflozin consistently improved HF outcomes both in patients at low or high HF risk.

### SGLT2 inhibitors in T2D and associated comorbidities-differentiating within the class [^11349AHz]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2019). Medium credibility.

In recent years, the Federal Drug Administration (FDA) has mandated CV outcomes trials (CVOTs) to assess the CV safety of all new glucose-lowering drugs, while the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has recommended either a CVOT or a meta-analysis. Unexpectedly, the results reported for treatment with the SGLT2 inhibitor empagliflozin in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME CVOT showed, for the first time, that an anti-diabetic agent could not only deliver glucose-lowering efficacy without any additional CV risk, but could actually provide CV benefit. This benefit included a reduction in CV death in the study population, which also contributed to a reduced risk of death by any cause. Subsequent CVOTs have also revealed CV benefits for a small number of other glucose-lowering drugs, whereas others did not show any CV benefits. Among CV benefits, only SGLT2 inhibitors have suggested a decrease in hospitalisation for heart failure.

With the new CVOT results, a paradigm for anti-diabetic drugs is emerging in which glucose-lowering is only one element of the overall treatment aim. As CV risk is the aspect of T2D that leads to the greatest mortality, we believe that CV health is an important consideration when deciding on the most appropriate therapies for any one individual. An integrated approach to disease management is desirable, encompassing prevention or control of CV risk together with the avoidance of renal complications, as these two factors are inextricably linked. Furthermore, drug dosing can be challenging for patients who develop chronic kidney disease (CKD), as impaired kidney function can potentially influence the pharmacokinetics of every therapeutic agent, and through different mechanisms. Given that many glucose-lowering drugs have not yet been extensively tested in a CKD population, making detailed analyses of renal data in the CVOT studies could be especially important, although dedicated renal studies are also ongoing.

### Renal and cardiovascular effects of SGLT2 inhibition in combination with loop diuretics in patients with type 2 diabetes and chronic heart failure: the RECEDE-CHF trial [^115hxLPR]. Circulation (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this randomized, controlled trial of the effects of SGLT2 inhibition in addition to loop diuretic in patients with HF with T2D, we found that within 6 weeks empagliflozin caused a significant increase in total urine volume without a significant increase in urinary sodium or FENa compared with placebo. We also found that empagliflozin caused a significant increase in electrolyte free water clearance. Empagliflozin also caused significant weight loss and overall changes in clinical status necessitating a reduction in furosemide dose. There were no significant changes in markers associated with intravascular volume change, including serum urea, hematocrit, or systolic blood pressure.

After DAPA-HF, SGLT2 inhibitors are increasingly being considered as an HF medication rather than as strictly antihyperglycemic therapy. The early benefit improvement in HF outcomes seen has raised the possibility that the osmotic diuresis caused by SGLT2 inhibitors might be one mechanism contributing to improved outcomes by improving ventricular loading conditions. Our study sheds light on this potential diuretic effect; our findings of a significant increase in urine volume without a significant increase in natriuresis with associated significant weight loss could be particularly beneficial in patients with HF in whom traditional strategies for reducing fluid overload — for example, combining loop and thiazide diuretics — can induce hyponatremia.

We found that empagliflozin caused a significant increase in 24-hour urine volume but did not have a significant effect on urine volume or sodium during the RPTs immediately after a single dose. This has been reported in other studies, although we have now extended this finding to patients with HF with T2D on loop diuretic, including in those with eGFR 45 to 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2. In a trial of 36 patients with T2D, canagliflozin caused an increase in total urine volume without any significant change in plasma volume at 12 weeks. In another small observational study in patients with CKD, dapagliflozin was associated with preferential reduction in extracellular water in comparison to furosemide. As a potential HF therapy, SGLT2 inhibitors could be frequently prescribed alongside loop diuretics, but there are little data on coadministration. A study of 42 healthy volunteers randomized to dapagliflozin, bumetanide, or combination therapy found that the combination of dapagliflozin and bumetanide caused a significant increase in urine volume, but not urinary sodium, compared with bumetanide alone. The authors also found that there was no significant change in natriuresis after the first dose of dapagliflozin, suggesting that there is an adaptive, synergistic increase in natriuresis over the first week.

Empagliflozin — cardiovascular outcomes in EMPA-REG OUTCOME — produced a 14% relative risk reduction in 3-point MACE versus placebo (HR: 0.86; 95% CI: 0.74 to 0.99), with a 32% reduction in all-cause mortality (HR: 0.68; 95% CI: 0.57 to 0.82) driven predominantly by a 38% reduction in CV death (HR: 0.62; 95% CI: 0.49 to 0.77). Effects on fatal or nonfatal MI were more modest (HR: 0.87; 95% CI: 0.70 to 1.09) and there was no significant difference for fatal or nonfatal stroke (HR: 1.18; 95% CI: 0.89 to 1.56). Hospitalization for heart failure was reduced by 35% (HR: 0.65; 95% CI: 0.50 to 0.85), and empagliflozin is specifically approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to reduce the risk of CV death in adults with T2D and established CV disease.

1 INTRODUCTION

Because type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a progressive disease, the majority of patients will require intensification of antihyperglycaemic treatments over time in order to attain and maintain glycaemic control. 1 The American Diabetes Association (ADA), 2 American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) 3 and other international associations 1 recommend combining antihyperglycaemic agents with complementary mechanisms of action when glucose‐lowering intensification is needed.

Glucagon‐like peptide‐1 receptor agonists (GLP‐1RAs) and sodium‐glucose co‐transporter‐2 inhibitors (SGLT2is) are drug classes that have been proven separately to improve glycaemic control. 1, 2, 4 Both classes are also associated with additional benefits, including reductions in blood pressure and body weight, low hypoglycaemia rates and a favourable safety profile in patients with T2D. 1, 2 The ADA/European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) recommend GLP‐1RAs as the preferred initial injectable therapy for patients with T2D and inadequately controlled HbA1c. 1 This drug class has a glucose‐dependent stimulatory effect on insulin secretion and an inhibitory effect on glucagon secretion from the pancreatic islets. 1, 5 SGLT2is have an insulin‐independent mode of action, lowering blood glucose through increased urinary glucose excretion. 6 Despite different mechanisms of action, both GLP‐1RAs (liraglutide, semaglutide, albiglutide and dulaglutide) and SGLT2is (dapagliflozin, empagliflozin and canagliflozin), administered separately, have been shown to reduce the time to various cardiovascular (CV) events (eg, CV death, non‐fatal myocardial infarction, non‐fatal stroke or hospitalization for heart failure [HF]) versus placebo in patients with T2D and at high risk of CV events. 2, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 Also, other differences between the classes are evident. For example, the risk of worsening HF or death from CV causes was lower with dapagliflozin compared with placebo, in patients with T2D, HF and reduced ejection fraction. 14 Because of these mechanisms of action and other differences, the combined use of GLP‐1RAs and SGLT2is is recommended by treatment guidelines. 2

Background

For patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D), cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the single most common cause of mortality. In 2008 and 2012, the Federal Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) respectively mandated cardiovascular outcomes trials (CVOTs) on all new anti-diabetic agents, as prospective trials statistically powered to rule out excess cardiovascular risk in patients with T2D. Unexpectedly, some of these CVOTs have demonstrated not only cardiovascular safety, but also cardioprotective effects, as was first shown for the SGLT2 inhibitor empagliflozin in EMPA-REG OUTCOME.

Expert Opinion

To debate newly available CVOT data and to put them into context, we convened as a group of medical experts from the Central and Eastern European Region. Here we describe our discussions, focusing on the conclusions we can draw from EMPA-REG OUTCOME and other SGLT2 inhibitor CVOTs, including when considered alongside real-world evidence.

Conclusion

CVOTs investigating SGLT2 inhibitors have suggested benefits beyond glucose lowering that have been confirmed in real-world evidence studies.

### Heart failure considerations of antihyperglycemic medications for type 2 diabetes [^116pWMsf]. Circulation Research (2016). Low credibility.

Prevalent and incident heart failure (HF) is increased in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus, with risk directly associated with the severity of hyperglycemia. Furthermore, in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, mortality is increased ≈10-fold in patients with versus without HF. Reducing HF with antihyperglycemic therapies, however, has been unsuccessful until recently. In fact, HF as an important outcome in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus seems to be heterogeneously modulated by antihyperglycemic medications, as evidenced by results from cardiovascular outcome trials (CVOTs) and large observational cohort studies. Appropriately powered and executed CVOTs are necessary to truly evaluate cardiovascular safety and efficacy of new antihyperglycemic medications, as reflected by the guidance of the US Food and Drug Administration and other regulatory agencies since 2008. In light of the best available evidence at present, metformin and the sodium-glucose-co-transporter 2-inhibitor empagliflozin seem to be especially advantageous with regard to HF effects, with their use associated with reduced HF events and improved mortality. Acarbose, the dipeptidyl-peptidase 4-inhibitor sitagliptin, the glucagon-like peptide 1-receptor agonist lixisenatide based on presently available CVOT results comprise reasonable additional options, as significant harm in terms of HF has been excluded for those drugs. Additions to this list are anticipated pending results of ongoing CVOTs. Although no HF harm was seen in CVOTs for insulin or sulfonylureas, they should be used only with caution in patients with HF, given their established high risk for hypoglycemia and some uncertainties on their safety in patients with HF derived from epidemiological observations. Pioglitazone is contraindicated in patients with HF > New York Heart Association I, despite some benefits suggested by CVOT subanalyses.

Summary of GLP-1RA CVOTs

a Not available as of March 2019, pending TGA approval

The heterogenous effects on MACE within this drug class may reflect differences in the patient populations and designs of the CVOTs as well as being potentially related to the pharmacokinetic and structural differences between the individual GLP-1RAs. Nevertheless, CV safety for all the approved agents in this class has been demonstrated in high-risk T2DM patients. In terms of safety and tolerability, transient nausea and vomiting are common side effects among patients initiated on GLP-1RAs yet are usually self-limiting with the longer acting agents. Retinopathy was seen in small numbers with semaglutide in cardiac safety trials.

SGLT - 2 inhibitors Three out of four TGA-approved agents in this class have CVOT data (Table 4). Both canagliflozin and empagliflozin demonstrated a CV benefit in terms of reducing the primary end point of MACE, while dapagliflozin was found to have a non-significant reduction in this end point. Ertugliflozin is yet to report CV outcome data (Table 1). In the EMPA-REG OUTCOME study, participants had established CVD (76% with coronary artery disease; 47% with a history of MI). The primary composite end point of death from CV causes, nonfatal MI or nonfatal stroke occurred in 10.5% (490 of 4687) receiving empagliflozin (pooled doses of 10 mg and 25 mg) vs. 12.1% (282 of 2333) in the placebo group, translating into a 14% relative risk reduction in these events (Table 4). This reduction was primarily driven by a 38% relative risk reduction in CV-related death.

Sodium–glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2is) and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) — cardiorenal effects and prioritization — are summarized, noting that SGLT2is "continue to exert their renal protective benefit for those with low eGFRs (eg, < 45 mL/min/1.73 m^2)" and "modestly increase LDL-C levels (4 to 8 mg/dL)". Cardiovascular outcome trials report "Empagliflozin and canagliflozin demonstrated reduction in MACE in CVOTs; empagliflozin also demonstrated decreased CV death and all-cause mortality" and "Empagliflozin, canagliflozin, and ertugliflozin have shown a decrease in hospitalization for HF in their CVOTs". Regulatory indications include that "the FDA has given canagliflozin an indication to reduce the risk of end-stage kidney disease, doubling of serum creatinine, CV death, and hospitalization for HF in adults with T2D and diabetic nephropathy with albuminuria" and "Dapagliflozin based on the DAPA-CKD RCT has received an FDA indication to reduce the risk of sustained eGFR decline, end-stage kidney disease, CV death, and hospitalization for HF in adults with CKD at risk of progression". Consequently, "individuals with T2D at significant risk for or with established ASCVD, HF, and/or CKD should be treated with a GLP-1 RA or SGLT2i with proven benefit for the individual's specific conditions".

### American association of clinical endocrinology consensus statement: comprehensive type 2 diabetes management algorithm-2023 update [^113fNY3E]. Endocrine Practice (2023). High credibility.

Type 2 diabetes with diabetic kidney disease (DKD) — SGLT2 inhibitor and GLP-1 RA renal guidance: Nearly 50% of U.S. adults with kidney failure have DM, and SGLT2 inhibitors show an approximately 38% reduction in composite adverse renal outcomes; use of an SGLT2i with proven benefit is recommended as foundational therapy to reduce progression of DKD and CV risk for persons with T2D and DKD with eGFR ≥ 25 mL/min/1.73 m^2 or ≥ 20 mL/min/1.73 m^2 if HF is also present. Dapagliflozin trials included participants with eGFR ≥ 25 to 75 mL/min/1.73 m^2 (including persons without DM) and empagliflozin trials included eGFR 30 to < 90 mL/min/1.73 m^2 (including persons with T2D ≥ 20%); dapagliflozin slowed decline more in T2D, while empagliflozin had similar eGFR decline across groups. GLP-1 RAs also are an option for reducing albuminuria progression, eGFR decline, and ASCVD risk in T2D with DKD with eGFR 15 mL/min/1.73 m^2.

### Effect of sodium-glucose Co-transporter-2 inhibitor on estimated plasma volume in a patient with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and a patient with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^115nwfCs]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

After discussion with the patient, the SGLTi empagliflozin was started in 2021 on top of the only tolerated medical therapy. The patient was instructed about hygiene measures. The treatment with empagliflozin 10 mg daily was well tolerated. The treatment was associated with weight reduction within 1 month (−3 kg) and improvement of symptoms. The patient did not report night dyspnea and was able to walk 10 steps at home. The treatment with empagliflozin was associated with the reduced need of HFH. The baseline (before therapy), 1 month, and 12 months after the treatment with SGLT2i laboratory tests were available. The furosemide dose and spironolactone dose has not been changed during 12 months follow‐up.

The second patient was a 77‐years‐old nondiabetic male with HFpEF caused by an advanced stage of nonobstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and permanent atrial fibrillation. The patient was referred to a tertiary care heart failure clinic 6 years ago because of worsening heart failure symptoms. The diagnosis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy was based on the echocardiography finding of severe septal hypertrophy of the left ventricle (20 mm) without obstruction of the left ventricular output tract. The patient had a normal coronary angiography finding, and cardiac magnetic resonance confirmed septal hypertrophy (22 mm at diastole), left ventricular ejection fraction of 60%, and absence of late gadolinium enhancement. The patient met the criteria for ICD implantation in primary prevention (history of syncope and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia found out at 24 h Holter electrocardiography monitoring. The patient had NYHA class III symptoms and recurrent HFH because of symptoms at rest (NYHA IV). With the evidence of lungs and systemic congestion. The patient was not referred for advanced heart failure therapy because of age. At the last clinic visit before the therapy change, the patient reported dyspnea during regular daily activities (not at rest or at night), low tolerability of exercise, weakness, dizziness, postural vertigo, and leg swellings. After discussion with the patient, the SGLTi empagliflozin 10 mg daily was added to the medical therapy on top of other pharmacotherapy, including maximal tolerated dose of beta‐blocker (bisoprolol 5 mg daily), eplerenone (50 mg daily), and furosemide (187.5 mg daily). The treatment with SGLT2i was well tolerated. The patient's weight decreased by 3 kg within 1 months and exercise tolerability improved. The furosemide dose and the eplerenone dose has not been changed during 12 months follow‐up. The estimated glomerular filtration rate and creatinine level did not change, and hematocrit and hemoglobin levels increased in the first month after gliflozin therapy. The treatment with SGLT2i reduced the risk of HFH in the second patient too. Neither of the two patients received iron replacement therapy or blood transfusion. Neither patient reported any bleeding event during follow‐up.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus — adults with cardiovascular or renal disease — in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus who have cardiovascular disease or renal disease, we suggest that the addition of a sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitor or glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA) be considered, even if individualized glycemic targets have been achieved. This recommendation is most applicable to patients who attain adequate glycemic control with monotherapy (i.e., metformin) or combination therapy with agents other than an SGLT-2 inhibitor or a GLP-1 RA; adding or substituting these agents could improve cardiovascular and renal outcomes but might pose an extra medication burden, and GLP-1 RAs and SGLT-2 inhibitors both have discrete adverse event profiles. The Work Group systematically reviewed the evidence, categorized this as Reviewed, New-added, and stated that the Work Group's confidence in the quality of the evidence was low.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Empagliflozin

Urinary Glucose Excretion

In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, urinary glucose excretion increased immediately following a dose of empagliflozin and was maintained at the end of a 4-week treatment period averaging at approximately 64 grams per day with 10 mg empagliflozin and 78 grams per day with 25 mg empagliflozin once daily. Data from single oral doses of empagliflozin in healthy subjects indicate that, on average, the elevation in urinary glucose excretion approaches baseline by about 3 days for the 10 mg and 25 mg doses.

Urinary Volume

In a 5-day study, mean 24-hour urine volume increase from baseline was 341 mL on Day 1 and 135 mL on Day 5 of empagliflozin 25 mg once daily treatment.

Cardiac Electrophysiology

In a randomized, placebo-controlled, active-comparator, crossover study, 30 healthy subjects were administered a single oral dose of empagliflozin 25 mg, empagliflozin 200 mg (8 times the maximum recommended dose), moxifloxacin, and placebo. No increase in QTc was observed with either 25 mg or 200 mg empagliflozin.

Linagliptin

Linagliptin binds to DPP-4 in a reversible manner and increases the concentrations of incretin hormones. Linagliptin glucose-dependently increases insulin secretion and lowers glucagon secretion, thus resulting in a better regulation of the glucose homeostasis. Linagliptin binds selectively to DPP-4 and selectively inhibits DPP-4, but not DPP-8 or DPP-9 activity in vitro at concentrations approximating therapeutic exposures.

Cardiac Electrophysiology

In a randomized, placebo-controlled, active-comparator, 4-way crossover study, 36 healthy subjects were administered a single oral dose of linagliptin 5 mg, linagliptin 100 mg (20 times the recommended dose), moxifloxacin, and placebo. No increase in QTc was observed with either the recommended dose of 5 mg or the 100 mg dose. At the 100 mg dose, peak linagliptin plasma concentrations were approximately 38-fold higher than the peak concentrations following a 5-mg dose.

GLYXAMBI

Administration of the fixed-dose combination with food resulted in no change in overall exposure of empagliflozin or linagliptin; however, the peak exposure was decreased 39% and 32% for empagliflozin and linagliptin, respectively. These changes are not likely to be clinically significant.

Inform patients that bullous pemphigoid has been reported during use of linagliptin. Instruct patients to seek medical advice if blisters or erosions occur [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11)].

Heart Failure

Inform patients of the signs and symptoms of heart failure. Before initiating GLYXAMBI, patients should be asked about a history of heart failure or other risk factors for heart failure including moderate to severe renal impairment. Instruct patients to contact their healthcare provider as soon as possible if they experience symptoms of heart failure, including increasing shortness of breath, rapid increase in weight or swelling of the feet [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12)].

### Newer pharmacologic treatments in adults with type 2 diabetes: a clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians [^111qpTGw]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Clinical considerations — initial and add-on therapy emphasize that metformin (unless contraindicated) and lifestyle modifications are the first steps in managing type 2 diabetes in most patients; clinicians should prioritize adding SGLT-2 inhibitors in patients with type 2 diabetes and CHF or CKD and should prioritize adding GLP-1 agonists in patients with an increased risk for stroke or when total body weight loss is an important goal; clinicians should aim to achieve HbA1c levels between 7% and 8% in most adults with type 2 diabetes and deintensify pharmacologic treatments in adults with HbA1c levels less than 6.5%; self-monitoring of blood glucose might be unnecessary for patients not receiving insulin; when SGLT-2 or GLP-1 therapy yields adequate glycemic control, clinicians should reduce or discontinue sulfonylureas or long-acting insulins due to increased risk for severe hypoglycemia; sulfonylureas and long-acting insulins are inferior to SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 agonists in reducing all-cause mortality and morbidity but may have limited value for glycemic control.
