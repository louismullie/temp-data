## Question

Pustule on the inside of the nasal septum

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how to evaluate and manage a pustule on the inside of the nasal septum. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate red flags and whether this could be a nasal septal abscess. Then, I should verify the focused history elements that narrow the differential. Next, I will outline the targeted physical examination and when to escalate to endoscopy or imaging. After that, I need to construct a prioritized differential diagnosis and decide on initial tests. Finally, I will lay out management pathways, including urgent surgical drainage if an abscess is suspected, and close with follow-up and complication prevention strategies.

> Let me first confirm the urgency: a pustule on the nasal septum can represent a septal abscess, which is a surgical emergency because it can rapidly destroy septal cartilage and lead to saddle nose deformity, and it can seed intracranial complications such as cavernous sinus thrombosis, meningitis, or brain abscess. I should not delay drainage if an abscess is suspected, especially with pain, swelling, fever, or nasal obstruction [^113VHFov] [^113P6oQ1] [^114JVt3n].

> Wait, let me verify the key history elements I must elicit to stratify risk and guide testing: onset and duration, recent nasal trauma or epistaxis procedures, prior septoplasty or cautery, diabetes or immunosuppression, intranasal drug use including cocaine, topical nasal steroid use, foreign body exposure (especially in children), and systemic symptoms such as fever, headache, or facial pain. I also need to ask about leishmaniasis risk or prior cutaneous lesions because mucosal leishmaniasis can involve the septum and cause destruction [^113VHFov] [^114iefAc] [^116i3UFe] [^113DigJG] [^1147bbyf] [^114HnUTR].

> Hold on, I should verify the examination sequence: start with anterior rhinoscopy to characterize the lesion as fluctuant versus firm, assess surrounding mucosal erythema and edema, and look for septal deviation or perforation. If the diagnosis is uncertain or if I suspect posterior extension, I should proceed to nasal endoscopy, and if I suspect deep abscess or complications, obtain a contrast-enhanced CT of the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses to define a rim-enhancing fluid collection and guide drainage planning [^1151JAeK] [^111tshuu] [^115wKgPr].

> Let me consider the differential diagnosis carefully and prioritize it: most likely is a nasal septal abscess arising from an infected septal hematoma or secondary to trauma, cautery, or surgery. Other considerations include nasal furunculosis of the vestibule, pyoderma gangrenosum mimicking infection, granulomatosis with polyangiitis with septal ulceration, mucosal leishmaniasis in at-risk patients, actinomycosis, and, less commonly, malignancy such as squamous cell carcinoma. I should double-check for foreign body in children and for medication-induced mucosal injury from intranasal steroids or bevacizumab in oncology patients [^113VHFov] [^114Cj3W9] [^112kSDV9] [^1152JDAR] [^111L996r] [^115gW7pn] [^114s7rbT] [^112pDvDA] [^113LzBBd].

> I need to ensure I do not jump to conclusions: if the lesion is small, superficial, and nonfluctuant, furunculosis is plausible, but if it is fluctuant and tender with surrounding cellulitis, an abscess is more likely. If there is chronicity, tissue destruction, or systemic features, I should broaden to vasculitis, leishmaniasis, or neoplasia and plan biopsy and targeted cultures accordingly [^114Cj3W9] [^113VHFov] [^111L996r].

> Next, I should review initial diagnostic testing: obtain aerobic and anaerobic cultures from purulent material if drained or aspirated, and send tissue for histopathology if the presentation is atypical, refractory, destructive, or suspicious for vasculitis, leishmaniasis, actinomycosis, or malignancy. In immunocompromised hosts or those with systemic symptoms, I should add CBC, inflammatory markers, and consider blood cultures before antibiotics if feasible [^113CHxX6] [^111L996r] [^115gW7pn] [^114s7rbT].

> I will now examine the urgent management pathway if nasal septal abscess is suspected: immediate ENT consultation for incision and drainage under local or general anesthesia, preservation of at least one mucoperichondrial flap if possible, and empiric intravenous antibiotics targeting Staphylococcus aureus (including MRSA risk) and streptococci, with adjustment to culture results. I should confirm that all cases in the systematic review were treated with drainage and that delays increase the risk of saddle nose and intracranial complications [^113VHFov] [^116GHX2U] [^113P6oQ1] [^114JVt3n].

> But wait, what if the lesion is actually a furuncle rather than an abscess: in that case, conservative therapy with warm compresses, topical mupirocin, and oral antistaphylococcal antibiotics may suffice, with close follow-up to ensure no progression. I should counsel on avoiding nose picking and trauma to prevent chondritis and deeper infection [^114Cj3W9].

> Let me reconsider systemic contributors: if pyoderma gangrenosum is suspected based on undermined violaceous ulcers, poor response to antibiotics, or associated systemic disease, I should avoid unnecessary debridement, treat with systemic corticosteroids or steroid-sparing agents, and exclude granulomatosis with polyangiitis with ANCA testing. If leishmaniasis is on the table, I should coordinate with infectious diseases for molecular diagnostics and systemic therapy. If actinomycosis is diagnosed, prolonged beta-lactam therapy is indicated after source control [^113rzjnD] [^115gW7pn] [^111L996r].

> I should double-check medication-related mucosal injury: intranasal corticosteroids can impair wound healing and rarely cause septal perforation. If there is active ulceration or recent trauma, I should hold steroids until healing, and if bevacizumab is implicated, multidisciplinary oncology–ENT management is warranted given the risk of persistent perforation and poor healing [^1147bbyf] [^113JtQwz] [^113LzBBd].

> Next, I should review complication prevention and follow-up: after abscess drainage, arrange close ENT follow-up at 48–72 hours, then weekly until mucosal integrity is restored. Monitor for saddle nose deformity, persistent perforation, and airflow symptoms, and if a perforation develops, discuss repair options including surgical closure or septal button once the active disease process is quiescent. I need to ensure diabetes is optimized and intranasal trauma is minimized to reduce recurrence risk [^113VHFov] [^113Cvdsq] [^113WTLCJ] [^116i3UFe].

> Hold on, I should verify pediatric nuances: in children, unilateral symptoms and foul discharge should trigger a careful foreign body search, and button batteries require emergent removal due to rapid septal injury within hours. If a septal abscess is present, the same principles of urgent drainage and antibiotics apply, with added vigilance for airway compromise and early ENT involvement [^112pDvDA] [^112SPnQd] [^1136r7jC].

> In summary, I need to ensure a high index of suspicion for nasal septal abscess in any septal pustule with pain, swelling, or systemic features, proceed to urgent drainage when indicated, tailor antibiotics to likely pathogens and culture results, and expand the differential when the course is atypical or refractory. Timely intervention prevents cartilage destruction and serious complications, and structured follow-up addresses functional and cosmetic sequelae [^113VHFov] [^111tshuu] [^113WTLCJ].

A pustule on the inside of the nasal septum is most often due to **local infection** (notably Staphylococcus aureus) [^116GHX2U] or **trauma-related injury** (nose picking, nasal hair plucking, or instrumentation) [^113fhnJj]. Other causes include nasal furunculosis [^114Cj3W9], intranasal corticosteroid use [^1147bbyf], and systemic conditions such as diabetes or immunosuppression [^116i3UFe]. Evaluation should include anterior rhinoscopy [^1151JAeK], nasal endoscopy [^1151JAeK], and culture if purulent; **prompt drainage** is indicated if an abscess is present [^113VHFov], with topical mupirocin and oral antibiotics for bacterial infection [^114Cj3W9]. Complications can include septal abscess, perforation, or saddle nose deformity [^113VHFov], so early intervention and follow-up are essential [^113VHFov].

---

## Etiology and risk factors

Several factors contribute to the formation of a pustule on the nasal septum:

- **Infectious causes**: Staphylococcus aureus is the most common pathogen [^116GHX2U], often associated with nasal colonization and minor trauma [^notfound]. Other bacteria, such as Streptococcus species, may also be involved [^113ECqDS].

- **Trauma**: Nose picking, nasal hair plucking, or instrumentation can cause minor injuries, providing a portal of entry for bacteria [^113fhnJj].

- **Nasal furunculosis**: A deep infection of the hair follicle within the nasal vestibule, often associated with Staphylococcus aureus [^114Cj3W9].

- **Intranasal corticosteroid use**: Prolonged use of nasal steroids can cause local immunosuppression, increasing the risk of infection and pustule formation [^1147bbyf].

- **Systemic conditions**: Diabetes mellitus, immunosuppression, and chronic rhinosinusitis predispose individuals to nasal infections and pustule formation [^116i3UFe].

---

## Clinical presentation

Patients with a pustule on the nasal septum typically present with:

- **Nasal pain or discomfort**: Localized pain is common, especially if the pustule is inflamed or infected [^113VHFov].

- **Nasal obstruction**: Swelling and inflammation can cause partial nasal obstruction [^116GHX2U].

- **Purulent discharge**: Yellow or green discharge may be present if the pustule is infected [^113ECqDS].

- **Crusting**: Nasal crusting is common, particularly if the pustule ruptures or leaks [^113ECqDS].

- **Systemic symptoms**: Fever, malaise, and headache may occur if the infection spreads or complications develop [^1122bQWT].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

A thorough clinical evaluation is essential to confirm the diagnosis and identify underlying causes:

- **Anterior rhinoscopy**: Allows visualization of the pustule, assessment of size, location, and surrounding mucosal inflammation [^notfound].

- **Nasal endoscopy**: Provides detailed visualization of the nasal cavity, allowing assessment of deeper structures and identification of additional lesions or abnormalities [^116fBApF].

- **Culture and sensitivity testing**: Swabbing the pustule for bacterial culture helps identify the causative organism and guide antibiotic therapy [^114JVt3n].

- **Imaging studies**: Computed tomography (CT) may be indicated if complications such as septal abscess, sinus involvement, or intracranial extension are suspected [^111tshuu].

---

## Differential diagnosis

The differential diagnosis for a pustule on the nasal septum includes:

| **Condition** | **Clinical features** | **Differentiating factors** |
|-|-|-|
| Nasal furunculosis | - Painful, erythematous nodule <br/> - Purulent discharge <br/> - Surrounding inflammation | - Deep follicular infection [^114Cj3W9] <br/> - Often associated with Staphylococcus aureus [^notfound] |
| Nasal septal abscess | - Fluctuant swelling <br/> - Severe pain <br/> - Nasal obstruction <br/> - Systemic symptoms | - Collection of pus between mucoperichondrium and cartilage [^113P6oQ1] <br/> - Requires urgent drainage [^111tshuu] |
| Pyoderma gangrenosum | - Painful ulcer with undermined edges <br/> - Rapid progression <br/> - Systemic association | - Autoimmune neutrophilic dermatosis <br/> - Associated with inflammatory bowel disease or rheumatoid arthritis [^116CjBzu] |
| Granulomatosis with polyangiitis | - Chronic nasal crusting <br/> - Ulceration <br/> - Septal perforation <br/> - Systemic symptoms | - ANCA-positive vasculitis <br/> - Multisystem involvement [^115NMb5S] |
| Nasal leishmaniasis | - Chronic ulceration <br/> - Tissue destruction <br/> - Septal perforation | - Travel history <br/> - Parasitic infection <br/> - Biopsy confirms diagnosis [^114HnUTR] |

---

## Management strategies

Management depends on the underlying cause, severity, and presence of complications:

- **Topical antibiotics**: Mupirocin ointment is effective for localized bacterial infections, particularly Staphylococcus aureus [^notfound].

- **Systemic antibiotics**: Oral antibiotics such as amoxicillin-clavulanate, cephalexin, or clindamycin are indicated for more extensive infections or when topical therapy is insufficient [^notfound].

- **Incision and drainage**: If a septal abscess is present, urgent surgical drainage is required to prevent cartilage destruction and complications such as saddle nose deformity [^113VHFov].

- **Address underlying factors**: Discontinuation of intranasal steroids, management of diabetes, and patient education to avoid nose picking or trauma are essential to prevent recurrence [^116GHX2U].

---

## Potential complications

Untreated or improperly managed pustules on the nasal septum can lead to **significant complications**:

- **Nasal septal abscess**: A collection of pus between the mucoperichondrium and cartilage, requiring urgent surgical intervention [^113VHFov].

- **Nasal septal perforation**: Permanent hole in the nasal septum, causing nasal obstruction, crusting, and whistling sounds [^115UaDTp].

- **Saddle nose deformity**: Collapse of the nasal bridge due to cartilage destruction, resulting in significant cosmetic and functional impairment [^114s7rbT].

- **Intracranial complications**: Rare but serious complications such as cavernous sinus thrombosis, meningitis, or brain abscess may occur if infection spreads [^114JVt3n].

---

## Prognosis and recurrence

With appropriate treatment, the prognosis is **generally favorable**. Recurrence is common if underlying factors such as nasal trauma, intranasal steroid use, or systemic conditions are not addressed. Patient education and follow-up are essential to minimize recurrence risk [^notfound].

---

A pustule on the inside of the nasal septum is most often due to local infection or trauma-related injury. Accurate diagnosis and appropriate management — including topical or systemic antibiotics, and surgical drainage if an abscess is present — are essential to prevent complications such as septal perforation or saddle nose deformity [^113VHFov].

Surgical Repair of the Nasal Septum

Patients with nasal septum perforation often experience symptoms such as nasal dryness, congestion, and recurrent rhinorrhea. Those with anterior septal perforations may also hear a whistling sound during breathing, which can significantly impact their quality of life. Therefore, once a septal perforation is identified, prompt surgical intervention is necessary. In patients with a deviated septum or with a spur of nasal septum, separating the mucosa on both sides of the septum may result in mucosal perforation. Consequently, any septal perforation must be addressed and repaired simultaneously. While autologous tissue remains the preferred choice for septal repair, artificial materials are increasingly used due to the limited availability of suitable cartilage. Common artificial materials for septal repair include polydioxanone (PDS), polycaprolactone (PCL), titanium, and acellular dermal matrix (ADM).

### Sterile nasal septal abscess in ulcerative colitis with crypt abscess-like neutrophilic infiltration [^115bEeUS]. The Laryngoscope (2025). Medium credibility.

We report a rare case of a sterile nasal septal abscess (NSA) occurring as an extraintestinal manifestation of ulcerative colitis (UC), accompanied by a novel histopathologic finding. A 40-year-old woman with relapsed UC presented with nasal swelling, purulent discharge, hematochezia, and skin lesions. Computed tomography revealed an anterior NSA, and emergent endoscopic drainage was performed. Despite broad-spectrum antibiotics, her condition worsened, and corticosteroids were initiated. Histopathologic analysis of the nasal mucosa demonstrated crypt abscess-like neutrophilic infiltration within glandular structures, resembling colonic crypt abscesses in active UC. Cultures were negative, and her condition improved with immunosuppressive therapy. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of a sterile NSA with crypt abscess-like structures in the nasal mucosa, expanding the histopathologic spectrum of sinonasal manifestations in UC. Early recognition and prompt immunosuppressive therapy are essential to avoid complications such as saddle nose deformity.

Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) can cause rhinosinusitis with nasal obstruction. As the disease becomes established, sinonasal erosion with osteitis and osteogenesis is common. There is a predilection for nasal septum involvement and perforation (Fig. 9). Of note, T-cell variant of sinonasal lymphoma can be indistinguishable from GPA-associated rhinosinusitis. Whilst cocaine-associated sinonasal disease can appear similar to GPA, unlike GPA it has a propensity to also cause soft and hard palate destruction.

There is widespread mucosal thickening throughout the sinuses with evidence of "frond-like" chronic remodelling and osteitis (long arrows). On the coronal image (b), erosion of the middle turbinates and irregularity of the nasal septum can be seen (short arrow)

Example of nose bandage from an ancient illustration (see text). In Hippocrates, Galenus, Oribasius (ed. Guidi G.), Chirurgia è graeco in latinum conversa, Vido Vidio florentino interprete. Luceciae Parisiorum, Excudebat Petrus Galterius, 1544, p. 439.

(Source: gallica.bnf.fr / Bibliothèque nationale de France)

When the fracture leads to a depression of the nasal septum, Hippocrates suggests to realign the bone by inserting a spatula into the nostrils until the shape of the nose is restored and then introduce packings, or gauzes, or a piece of Carthage leather, into the nostrils, quite similarly, if not for the materials, to modern nasal packing. If the fracture involves the nasal root and dorsum, it is necessary, according to Hippocrates, to work only with the fingers, both from inside and from outside the nostrils, to realign the fracture fragments, without packings, which would cause excessive pain. The physician should repeat this operation for several days, with the aid of a woman with slender fingers or even a child working from the inside of the nostril, while the doctor works from the outside. Only later, if the nose shows signs of deviation, packings can be used. Even today, some fractures of the nasal root, which are difficult to reduce, are often treated with secondary surgery and with the aid of modern imaging technology for the correction of residual deformities.

### Sewing: a new quilting suture method for nasal septum repair [^116Gy4Xh]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Ensuring the integrity of at least one side of the mucosa during nasal septal surgery is essential to minimize or avoid nasal septal perforation. The most reliable way is to ensure the integrity of the mucosa on both sides of the nasal septum. However, due to bone spurs, it may be challenging to avoid local perforation on one side. For the packing group, the nasal septum cartilage removed from the perforation can be placed inside the nasal septum at the perforation site, or the mucosa on both sides of the perforation can be sutured. However, this suturing can often be challenging. Passing the suture across both sides of the mucosal perforation can be sufficient for the suture group. These measures can help reduce the incidence of perforation.

Nasal packing cannot reduce nasal adhesion. To reduce nasal adhesion, cleaning the NC regularly after surgery is important. If adhesion is found, it can be separated, and a gelatin sponge or Vaseline gauze can be used to separate the adhesion site. Generally, it should be kept for about 5 days to prevent further adhesion. The use of antibiotics after surgery is an effective method for treating local nasal infections. In the case of the suture group, waiting for the suture to fall off naturally may lead to microbial growth on the suture during this process. Studies have shown that both absorbable and non-absorbable sutures can contribute to microbial growth. However, removing sutures in the suture group can minimize the risk of microbial parasitism on the suture. Overall, we have not encountered any cases where leaving absorbable sutures in the nasal septum for a long time caused discomfort to patients due to nasal infection.

Rhinitis 2020 practice parameter — nasal foreign bodies clinical features, burden, risks, and removal: These "are common among young children", and "Most cases present with unilateral congestion and foul-smelling purulent rhinorrhea". Burden is substantial because "Foreign bodies are estimated to account for 30% of ear, nose, and throat emergencies of which 19% are intranasal". Complications occur since "Complications of nasal foreign bodies include infection, nasal perforation and epistaxis", with heightened concern that "button batteries… can be corrosive and lead to septal perforation". Management can be complex because "Removal may require general anesthesia, especially in cases of prolonged impaction because of associated inflammation".

Pre-septal cellulitis — clinical features, common sources, and likely organisms are described: Pre-septal cellulitis is characterized by inflammation of the eyelids, conjunctiva, and surrounding skin without involvement of deeper tissues and no pain with eye movements, with symptoms including eyelid erythema, warmth, tenderness and fluctuant lymphedema or swelling that can extend over the nasal bridge to the opposite eyelids usually accompanied by low-grade fever and elevated white blood cell count. Often there is a history of sinusitis, insect bite, dacryocystitis, local skin abrasion, laceration, dental abscess, or puncture wound. Culture of open wounds, weeping vesicles, purulent nasal drainage, and conjunctival discharge often yield S. aureus, β-hemolytic streptococci, S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, and/or P. aeruginosa, and rapid treatment often yields a good outcome.

### Surgical management of the septal perforation [^113WTLCJ]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Initial management of a septal perforation involves medical intervention, but there are several surgical options available. Deciding to proceed with a surgical repair is dependent on the etiology of the defect, how the symptoms impact the patient, the extent of damage or impending destruction to the nasal support, and the absence of any active disease process. The literature describes several methods for septal perforation repair; each has its technical challenges because of the tenuous nature of the tissues and limited surgical exposure of the area. This article reviews the diagnostic work-up of septal perforations, the medical management, and the surgical treatment options, with emphasis placed on the open rhinoplasty approach.

Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) monitoring — Persons with CL should be actively monitored by clinical appearance, including by performing a careful nasal and oropharyngeal examination periodically up to 1 year, or at least 2 years if at increased risk for ML. They should be educated about the signs and symptoms of relapse and ML and instructed to seek medical attention anytime these appear (strong, low). Symptoms such as chronic nasal stuffiness, epistaxis, or hoarseness or findings such as septal perforation that occur anytime in a person with a prior or current diagnosis of CL or a scar consistent with prior CL should prompt evaluation for ML, including fiber-optic examination of the affected area if relevant (see II and III) (strong, moderate).

### Nasal septal abscesses: a systematic review [^113VHFov]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Nasal septal abscesses (NSA) necessitate prompt recognition and management to prevent morbidity and long-term sequelae. To date, no comprehensive review of NSA alone has been conducted.

Objective

To conduct a systematic review of the presentation and management of NSA and determine patients at risk of sequelae.

Methods

Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines were followed. PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane, and reference lists were searched. Patient demographic information, etiology, presentation, management, and outcomes were recorded and analyzed.

Results

A total of 79 articles (90 cases) were included. The mean age was 32.86 years old with a slight male predominance. The most common signs were nasal pain (44.86%, N = 48), trouble breathing (23.36%, N = 25), and headache (15.89%, N = 17). All cases were treated with intranasal drainage. Most patients (66.67%, N = 60) were asymptomatic at last follow-up. Most abscesses (73.07%) were located in the anterior septum. Of those patients who experienced complications, common complications were saddle nose deformity (70.59%, N = 24), nasal obstruction (5.88%, N = 2), and septal perforation (5.88%, N = 2). No significant association between age (P = 0.23), sex (P = 0.99), history of diabetes (P = 0.11), history of nasal trauma (P = 0.91), history of nasal/dental surgery (P = 0.14), location (P = 0.18), or postoperative nasal packing (P = 0.65) and NSA outcomes was found.

Conclusion

Patients with or without a history of immunodeficiency, trauma, or nasal surgery are at risk of developing NSA. Without adequate treatment, NSA can be associated with functional and aesthetic sequelae.

A 63-year-old man presented to the outpatient department of our tertiary care hospital, with unilateral left nasal obstruction, foul smelling nasal discharge and occasional mild epistaxis. On examination, a hard greyish black mass was noted in the anteroinferior portion of the inferior turbinate, with extension posteriorly into the inferior meatus with surrounding unhealthy granulation tissue. Provisional diagnosis of rhinolith was surprisingly reversed by histopathology, which suggested the presence of an Aspergillus fungus ball with Actinomyces colonisation.

### Clinical practice guideline: nosebleed (epistaxis) [^117DuBnT]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2020). High credibility.

Nasal endoscopy in recurrent epistaxis — indications and yield: Nasal endoscopy should be performed for those patients who have recurrent bleeding after initial control with cautery or nasal packing, and such recurrence of epistaxis is seen more commonly in those with bleeding from areas other than Kiesselbach's plexus and when the site was not located on initial evaluation; with nasal endoscopy, the bleeding site can be localized in 87% to 93% of cases, and posterior epistaxis can occur from the septum (70%) or the lateral nasal wall (24%), supporting targeted therapy; recurrent unilateral epistaxis with unilateral nasal obstruction should prompt evaluation with endoscopy of the nose and nasopharynx.

### Posterior nasal septal abscess detected during evaluation of cavernous sinus thrombosis [^114JVt3n]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Septic cavernous sinus thrombosis (CST) is a rare, life-threatening condition that commonly originates from sinusitis. Posterior nasal septal abscess (NSA) is an extremely rare cause of septic CST because it is a very rare condition by itself. Here we report a rare case involving an elderly woman with septic CST associated with a posterior NSA that was successfully treated without any sequelae. Incision and drainage of the posterior NSA were performed under local anesthesia, and the nasal packing was removed 2 days postoperatively. Pus from the abscess was sent for culture and sensitivity analyses, which revealed Enterococcus faecium. She was treated with intravenous (IV) third-generation cephalosporin (2 g twice daily) and IV vancomycin (0.75 g twice daily) for 4 weeks. IV low-molecular-weight heparin was administered at a dose of 40 mg twice daily for 4 days, followed by warfarin (3 mg once a day) for 21 days. The patient was discharged without any sequelae after 4 weeks. At the 2-month follow-up, she did not complain of any further symptoms. The findings from this case suggest that clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion and provide prompt treatment to prevent mortality and morbidity associated with septic CST.

### Nasal septal and mucosal disease associated with pyoderma gangrenosum in a cocaine user [^113rzjnD]. JAAD Case Reports (2017). Low credibility.

PG was recently recognized as a complication of levamisole-contaminated cocaine use. Cocaine and levamisole enhance inflammation and autoimmunity by promoting release of neutrophil extracellular traps, whereas levamisole also increases neutrophil chemotaxis response. Levamisole-tainted cocaine use may result in PG lesions refractory to treatment and occurring in unusual sites such as the face, neck, and trunk. Detection of serum levamisole is helpful, although the estimated mean half-life of levamisole in the blood is only 5.6 hours, which can result in a negative test if the drug exposure occurred more than 24 hours before testing, as in our patient.

We report this case to highlight unusual sites of PG and recognition of early lesions of PG as a complication of habitual cocaine use. The case raises awareness of the broad differential diagnoses of head and neck PG and systemic manifestations of cocaine use disorder. Counselling on cocaine cessation with local wound care and short courses of systemic corticosteroids can help control inflammation. In refractory cases, alternatives to corticosteroid such as cyclosporine, cyclophosphamide, azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, and anti–tumor necrosis factor-α drugs can be considered.

### Recalcitrant cutaneous pyoderma gangrenosum with pulmonary involvement resolved with treatment of underlying plasma cell dyscrasia [^112czBvR]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

PG represents one of the neutrophilic dermatoses. These are clinically dissimilar diseases united by morphological overlap, polymorphonuclear infiltrates on histopathology, extracutaneous neutrophilic infiltrates, and frequent associations with systemic disease. Manifesting this clinical heterogeneity, this patient's pulmonary involvement by PG was difficult to diagnose due to this uncommon location and mimicry of pneumonia. Additionally, it is exceedingly rare for the lungs to be the initial and sole site of PG involvement. However, pulmonary involvement is the most common extracutaneous site of PG, and such cases are more often associated with hematologic disease than classic PG. As we observed, PG with pulmonary involvement is often presumed to be a pneumonia until it becomes clear that antibiotics are ineffective. A lung biopsy was performed, resulting in an ulcer at the surgical incision. In light of this pathergy, cutaneous PG with pulmonary involvement was more strongly considered. This demonstrates the difficulty of diagnosing PG, particularly when it does not manifest in a typical location. In fact, her diagnosis was still in question, when we considered granulomatosis with polyangiitis, given her lung lesions and perforated nasal septum, though the absence of primary vasculitis on biopsies and a negative test for antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies made PG more likely.

### Clinical practice guideline: nosebleed (epistaxis) [^112r4kfm]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2020). High credibility.

Nasal packing — complications, typical duration, and antibiotics: Packing duration typically ranges from 48 hours to 72 hours or even longer, and one retrospective case series of 147 nosebleed patients showed no correlation between recurrence of nosebleeds and use of shorter packing durations, noting an 85% nosebleed control rate with packing durations of 1 to 3 days. Several studies suggest that use of systemic antibiotics following nasal packing should not be mandatory; although the 1 available systematic review did not show a significant benefit to the use of antibiotics with nasal packing, the individual studies were underpowered, so the risks and benefits should be evaluated in each patient. Reported complications include airway obstruction if packs are malpositioned or become dislodged, synechiae with long-term nasal obstruction, and nasal septal perforation with bilateral nasal packings.

17.	PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

See FDA-approved labeling

17.1 Local Nasal Effect

Patients should be informed that treatment with NASONEX Nasal Spray 50 mcg may be associated with adverse reactions which include epistaxis (nose bleed) and nasal septum perforation. Candida infection may also occur. Because of the inhibitory effect of corticosteroids on wound healing, patients who have experienced recent nasal septum ulcers, nasal surgery, or nasal trauma should not use a nasal corticosteroid until healing has occurred [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Patients should be cautioned not to spray NASONEX Nasal Spray 50 mcg directly onto the nasal septum.

17.2 Glaucoma and Cataracts

Patients should be informed that nasal and inhaled corticosteroids may result in the development of glaucoma and/or cataracts. Therefore, close monitoring is warranted in patients with a change in vision or with a history of increased intraocular pressure, glaucoma, and/or cataracts. Patients should be cautioned not to spray NASONEX Nasal Spray 50 mcg into the eyes [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

17.3 Immunosuppression

Persons who are on immunosuppressant doses of corticosteroids should be warned to avoid exposure to chickenpox or measles, and patients should also be advised that if they are exposed, medical advice should be sought without delay [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

17.4 Use Regularly for Best Effect

Patients should use NASONEX Nasal Spray 50 mcg on a regular basis for optimal effect. Improvement in nasal symptoms of allergic rhinitis has been shown to occur within 1 to 2 days after initiation of dosing. Maximum benefit is usually achieved within 1 to 2 weeks after initiation of dosing. Patients should not increase the prescribed dosage but should contact their physician if symptoms do not improve, or if the condition worsens. Administration to young children should be aided by an adult.

If a patient missed a dose, the patient should be advised to take the dose as soon as they remember. The patient should not take more than the recommended dose for the day.

### Tubercular septal abscess in a postoperative patient: a novel entity [^111sVK39]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Extrapulmonary tuberculosis is a rather uncommon and potentially challenging phenomenon. Such manifestation, particularly in the scenario of a late postoperative period, is extremely rare and requires a high index of suspicion, prompt diagnosis and appropriate treatment. We present the case scenario of a patient with history of successfully treated pulmonary tuberculosis many years earlier, without any signs of recurrence, who developed primary nasal septal tuberculosis after undergoing septoplasty to correct his septal deviation. His postoperative course remained uneventful for 4months. He then presented with a spontaneous nasal septal abscess, which proved to be tubercular in nature on investigations. Appropriate diagnosis was established, and the patient was treated successfully with antituberculous therapy. Recurrent tuberculosis may present a diagnostic challenge for healthcare professionals. Only a high index of suspicion, modern diagnostic tools and institution of appropriate treatment including surgical intervention as required will ensure a promising outcome.

Purposes

The purpose of this study was to present and analyze the etiologic factors, clinical manifestations, bacteriology, and treatment outcomes of nasal septal abscess in a large cohort of adult patients.

Material and Methods

Retrospective analysis.

Results

36 adult patients, age from 19 to 85 (mean age, 51.83), with nasal septal abscesses were treated at Ear Nose Throat Hospital of Ho Chi Minh City from January 2020 to August 2022. The most common symptoms were nasal obstruction (75%), headache/facial pain (58.33%). Etiologic factors were found in 83.33% of cases with the most common were diabetes mellitus (47.22%), nose-picking (44.44%). 75% of cases had positive bacterial culture, of which 70.37% were Staphylococcus aureus. Septal abscess was successfully treated in all cases using our treatment protocol, which involved an extended modified Killian's incision, irrigation with 1% poviodine, placement of gauze in the abscess pocket, and nasal packing with Merocels.

Conclusions

Diabetes and nose-picking were the most common etiologic factors; Staphylococcus aureus was the most common organism of nasal septal abscess in our study. Our treatment protocol is safe and effective.

### Considerations in the etiology, treatment, and repair of septal perforations [^113Cvdsq]. Facial Plastic Surgery Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

Nasal septal perforations present a distinct challenge to the facial plastic surgeon. A clearcut causal factor must be established from a long, diverse list of potential causes. Surgical repair presents a complex technical challenge, because a septal perforation is a hole in three distinct contiguous layers composed of both right and left septal mucoperichondral flaps and the intervening cartilage, all three of which must be separated from each other and repaired individually. This article describes presenting symptoms and findings for septal perforations, the history and physical examination, causes, helpful hints for prevention of perforations, and surgical and nonsurgical treatment options and outcomes.

### Three spontaneous occurrences of nasal septal abscess in patients with chronic asymptomatic HIV-the need for early intervention and reconstruction [^1122bQWT]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2009). Low credibility.

We identified 3 patients with chronic, asymptomatic HIV who presented between 2001 and 2005 with spontaneous nasal septal abscesses in the absence of previous trauma, nasal surgery, sinusitis, infection, or immunodeficiency. A MEDLINE search revealed no other cases of spontaneous isolated nasal septal abscesses. Each of our patients presented to the emergency department with complaints of fever and headaches; 2 of them also had nasal obstruction, nasal and lip swelling, and pain. Clinical examinations and imaging studies revealed isolated anterior nasal septal abscesses. In each case, incision and drainage was performed immediately, and antibiotics started. One patient had an early loss of septal cartilage and nasal support, which developed into a crooked and saddle-nose deformity requiring reconstruction 7 months later. Staphylococcus aureus was identified in all 3 cases. To the best of our knowledge, these are the only 3 cases of spontaneous isolated nasal septal abscess reported in the literature. We discuss the importance of early diagnosis and intervention, as well as reconstructive techniques.

### Clinical practice guideline: improving nasal form and function after rhinoplasty [^1151JAeK]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Preoperative evaluation for nasal airway obstruction in rhinoplasty — clinicians should document whether it is one or both sides that are congested and at what time of the day this occurs, distinguish intermittent nasal congestion from the nasal cycle, and patients should be educated that breathing through only 1 side of the nose may be normal because the nasal cycle occurs every 1.5 to 3.0 hours. Patient-oriented surveys may include any or all of the following: Nasal Obstruction Septoplasty Effectiveness (NOSE) scale, the visual analog scale, or the Sino-Nasal Outcome Test (SNOT-22). Anterior rhinoscopy is useful for evaluating the nasal septum and turbinates, and among patients with nasal airway obstruction and no obvious cause on anterior rhinoscopy, nasal endoscopy can be valuable and can provide additional information regarding the posterior septum, the ostiomeatal complex, the possibility of nasal polyps or purulent drainage, the posterior choanae, adenoidal hypertrophy, and the presence of any tumors. Septoplasty can improve the nasal airway; therefore, a thorough evaluation of the septum preoperatively is critical, and enlarged inferior turbinates should be evaluated and evaluation of these structures should be included in the preoperative physical examination. Surgery to correct nasal valve collapse can also improve the nasal airway; therefore, evaluating the internal nasal valve and external nasal valve areas are important, and techniques such as static and dynamic inspection, the modified Cottle maneuver, and palpation can augment the physical examination. The rhinoplasty surgeon should be cognizant of the dynamic nature of the operation and consider how attempts to alter the aesthetic appearance of the nose may affect nasal airway obstruction, and the preoperative examination should identify potential intraoperative areas for concern. Imaging studies are unnecessary to determine the extent of septal deviation, turbinate hypertrophy, and nasal deformity, and plain radiographs should not be performed; in the patient with signs and symptoms of sinusitis, a computed tomography scan may be helpful. Rhinometry is another diagnostic modality that can be helpful in documenting nasal congestion and it is not widely performed at this time, but it is the best objective measurement, and it is important to ask patients about any problems with their sense of smell so that any abnormalities can be documented prior to surgery.

IDSA/ASTMH leishmaniasis guidelines — New World mucosal leishmaniasis (ML) specimen collection and diagnostic considerations — The initial and most prominent mucosal manifestations typically are nasal (eg, chronic unexplained congestion/secretions), and clinical signs may include erythema, edema, hyperemia, infiltration, nodules, erosion, ulceration, and tissue destruction (eg, perforation of the nasal septum) (fact, no grade). Mucosal areas that have macroscopic abnormalities are recommended for specimen collection; biopsy specimens, obtained by an otolaryngologist, are useful for confirming the diagnosis by molecular and traditional methods and for excluding other etiologies (strong, low). However, obtaining mucosal specimens for Leishmania testing — even via relatively noninvasive means (eg, via nasal swab or cytologic brush) — typically is not recommended for persons who do not have any macroscopic mucosal abnormalities, and detecting the parasite DNA in naso-oropharyngeal mucosa does not suffice to diagnose ML. Investigational testing for the presence of Leishmania RNA virus is not readily available and, to date, has not been found useful for identifying persons who may have or be at risk for ML.

### Fluticasone [^1179TcLE]. FDA (2019). Medium credibility.

Intranasal corticosteroids should be used with caution, if at all, in patients with active or quiescent tuberculous infections of the respiratory tract; untreated local or systemic fungal or bacterial infections; systemic viral or parasitic infections; or ocular herpes simplex.

Because of the inhibitory effect of corticosteroids on wound healing, patients who have experienced recent nasal septal ulcers, nasal surgery, or nasal trauma should not use a nasal corticosteroid until healing has occurred.

Information for Patients

Patients being treated with Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray, USP should receive the following information and instructions. This information is intended to aid them in the safe and effective use of this medication. It is not a disclosure of all possible adverse or intended effects.

Patients should be warned to avoid exposure to chickenpox or measles and, if exposed, to consult their physician without delay.

Patients should use Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray, USP at regular intervals for optimal effect. Some patients (12 years of age and older) with seasonal allergic rhinitis may find as-needed use of 200 mcg once daily effective for symptom control (see Clinical Trials).

A decrease in nasal symptoms may occur as soon as 12 hours after starting therapy with Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray, USP. Results in several clinical trials indicate statistically significant improvement within the first day or two of treatment; however, the full benefit of Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray, USP may not be achieved until treatment has been administered for several days. The patient should not increase the prescribed dosage but should contact the physician if symptoms do not improve or if the condition worsens.

### Chronic rhinosinusitis [^116bXB7B]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2013). Low credibility.

A 50-year-old woman with nonallergic rhinitis, asthma, and aspirin intolerance presented with worsening symptoms of nasal congestion, purulent drainage, and anosmia. Nasal polyps were visualized on anterior rhinoscopy, and there was evidence of chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) on imaging studies during work-up for another medical condition. Over a 2-year period she had numerous bouts of acute exacerbations of CRS which required multiple courses of antibiotics; however, she was unwilling to undergo surgery to reduce polyp burden. She successfully underwent aspirin desensitization and experienced partial relief of symptoms with daily aspirin ingestion. Nasal obstruction is a common symptom that can result from multiple causes, including mucosal disorders (eg, allergic and nonallergic rhinitis, rhinosinusitis, sarcoid) and structural disorders (eg, nasal septal deviation, tumors, mucoceles). The various causes and work-up for nasal obstruction are discussed with emphasis placed on CRS, which is a prevalent disease characterized by inflammation of the nose and paranasal sinuses for a duration of > 12 weeks. The different subtypes of CRS, including CRS with and without nasal polyps, allergic fungal rhinosinusitis, and aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease, are discussed along with pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment options.

Know the medicines you take. Keep a list of them to show your healthcare provider and pharmacist when you get a new medicine.

What are the possible side effects of OMNARIS Nasal Spray?

OMNARIS Nasal Spray may cause serious side effects, including:

Nasal Problems. Symptoms of nasal problems may include:
Nose bleeds.
Crusting in the nose.
Sores (ulcers) in the nose.
Hole in the cartilage of the nose (nasal septal perforation). A whistling sound when you breathe may be a symptom of nasal septum perforation.
Thrush (candida), a fungal infection in your nose and throat. Tell your healthcare provider if you have any redness or white colored patches in your nose or mouth.
Slow wound healing. You should not use OMNARIS Nasal Spray until your nose has healed if you have a sore in your nose, have had surgery on your nose, or if your nose has been injured.
Eye problems, including glaucoma and cataracts. You should have regular eye exams while you use OMNARIS Nasal Spray.
Serious allergic reactions. Call your healthcare provider or get emergency medical care if you get any of the following signs of a serious allergic reaction:
rash
hives
swelling of your face, mouth, and tongue
breathing problems
low blood pressure
Weakened immune system and increased chance of getting infections (immunosuppression). Taking medicines that weaken your immune system makes you more likely to get infections and can make certain infections worse. These infections may include tuberculosis (TB), herpes simplex infections of the eyes (ocular herpes simplex infections), and infections caused by fungi, bacteria, viruses, and parasites. You should avoid contact with people who have a contagious disease such as chickenpox or measles while using OMNARIS Nasal Spray. If you come in contact with someone who has chickenpox or measles, call your healthcare provider right away. Symptoms of an infection may include:
fever
pain
aches
chills
feeling tired
nausea
vomiting
Reduced adrenal function (adrenal insufficiency). Adrenal insufficiency happens when your adrenal glands do not make enough steroid hormones. This can happen when you stop taking oral corticosteroid medicines (such as prednisone) and start taking medicine containing a steroid inhaled into the lungs or for use in the nose. Symptoms of adrenal insufficiency may include:
Tiredness
Weakness
Nausea and vomiting
Low blood pressure
Slowed growth in children. A child taking OMNARIS Nasal Spray should have their growth checked regularly.

### Nasal septal abscess in patients with immunosuppression [^111tshuu]. AJNR: American Journal of Neuroradiology (2007). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

The purpose of this study was to review the imaging findings of nasal septal abscess in 2 patients with immunosuppression.

Materials and Methods

Two patients with immunosuppression were identified as having a nasal septal abscess, and correlative CT imaging in both patients was evaluated.

Results

The characteristic radiographic appearance of a nasal septal abscess included a fluid collection with thin rim enhancement, located within the cartilaginous nasal septum. After CT examination, incision and drainage was performed in both patients, and appropriate antibiotic coverage was initiated. Clinical and imaging follow-up demonstrated no signs of residual infection.

Conclusion

Nasal septal abscess has a characteristic appearance on CT examination. Prompt diagnosis and treatment, including incision and drainage and appropriate antibiotic coverage, are necessary to avoid serious complications.

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis update [^111c9ErV]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

ABRS severity and timing thresholds — escalation considerations: It is the opinion of the GUG that waiting more than 15 to 20 days from symptom onset before a trial of antibiotic therapy is not in the patient's best interest if symptoms are worsening or not improving. Severe disease was characterized by high fever (39°C or 102°F) and purulent nasal discharge lasting at least 3–4 consecutive days. Clinical manifestations suggestive of suppurative complications of ABRS with extension beyond the sinuses or odontogenic source require immediate antibiotic treatment or referral to an otolaryngologist and are excluded from this statement.

A 30-year-old female presented with a 6-month history of a persistent lesion on her nasal tip. The lesion failed to respond to a 4-week course of doxycycline 100 mg twice daily, a 2-week course of cephalexin 500 mg twice daily, and 2 injections of intralesional triamcinolone. The patient reported no significant past medical history and was sexually active with 1 female partner. On physical exam, the lesion appeared as a crusting, erythematous nodule with purulent discharge (Fig 1). Culture of the discharge grew 2+ gram-positive, catalase-negative, beta-hemolytic, Christie-Atkins-Munch-Petersen-positive, and facultatively anaerobic cocci arranged in chains.

### Epistaxis and Staphylococcus aureus colonization in the nasal vestibule: is it a cause or consequence? [^113mWeU6]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to investigate the relation between epistaxis and nasal colonization of Staphylococcus aureus in a population of patients with recurrent epistaxis. A total of 361 men and women were recruited, 245 patients with epistaxis (114 had crusting in the nasal vestibule; 131 did not) and 116 control subjects. A microbiology swab was taken from the anterior nasal cavity of each subject. Staphylococcus aureus was found to be more common in the epistaxis group when compared with the control group with a percentage of 31.8% and 4.3%, respectively (P < 0.05). There was no difference in the prevalence of S. aureus between the crust and non-crust groups (P > 0.05). When positive cultures were grouped and compared according to season, it was observed that the positive culture with epistaxis was much higher (44.82%) in the autumn period. Staphylococcus aureus colonization in the nasal vestibule is more likely to be observed in individuals who have recurrent epistaxis than in those who do not have. It seems that this colonization may have a role in the etiology of epistaxis. However, with an altered medium of the nasal vestibule after each epistaxis period, it is also possible to speculate that this colonization is may be the consequence of epistaxis itself.

### Clinical effectiveness of septoplasty versus medical management for nasal airways obstruction: multicentre, open label, randomised controlled trial [^114avpeM]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Limitations of this study

The study has several limitations. At baseline, more than 80% of patients had NOSE scores in the severe or extreme category. This may reflect the population currently referred to secondary care. However, the conclusions for these two subgroups were strong. The benefits for those participants with moderate baseline symptoms was less clear, whereas those with moderate NOSE scores at baseline did not report an improvement that reached the minimal clinically important difference of 9 points on SNOT-22 — only 18 participants were included in this subgroup of the STEPP analysis.

Nasal obstruction is a non-specific symptom with many underlying possible causes (chronic rhinosinusitis, allergic rhinitis, non-allergic rhinitis, nasal valve dysfunction). As a pragmatic trial, the current study did not seek to diagnose or treat these conditions before randomisation. Also, surgical interventions were performed by experienced surgeons. In NHS practice, septoplasty is often performed by junior trainee surgeons, albeit many are supervised by more senior colleagues. The evidence is limited for septoplasty outcomes and surgeon experience. However, previous studies have found no association between grade of surgeon and septoplasty outcomes when assessing the need for revision surgeryor the postoperative appearance of the septum. Covid-19 had a considerable impact on the current trial. All forms of airway clinical assessment and objective measurements of nasal patency were suspended from March 2020 onwards. As a result of the smaller numbers of participants, this may have had an impact on the precision of the statistical results. All other patient reported outcome measures were collected remotely during the pandemic, ensuring that we could report the trial results reliably.

The current trial did not assess, and therefore cannot define, what should constitute an appropriate trial of medical management for patients and clinicians to consider before septal surgery is discussed. Participants in the medical management group reported an improvement in symptoms with mometasone nasal steroid and saline sprays. Participants with an element of underlying rhinitis contributing to the nasal obstruction in addition to the septal deviation may have responded to this treatment. Consensus opinion from the US recommends a course of medical management for four weeks before septoplasty is considered.

Conclusions

Septoplasty is a superior treatment for nasal obstruction associated with septal deviation compared with a defined regimen of nasal steroid and saline sprays. Baseline NOSE scores can estimate the likely improvement in symptoms and guide decision making for patients and clinicians. The authors recommend that adults presenting with nasal obstruction associated with a deviated nasal septum should be offered septoplasty.

### Masses of the nose, nasal cavity, and nasopharynx in children [^1157SeKi]. Radiographics (2017). Low credibility.

A wide range of masses develop in the nose, nasal cavity, and nasopharynx in children. These lesions may arise from the nasal ala or other structures of the nose, including the mucosa covering any surface of the nasal cavity, the cartilaginous or osseous portion of the nasal septum, the nasal turbinates, and the nasal bones. Lesions may also arise from the nasopharynx or adjacent structures and involve the nose by way of direct extension. The causes of nasal masses in children include congenital and developmental disorders such as congenital nasolacrimal duct mucocele, dermoid cyst, cephalocele, and nasal neuroglial heterotopia; inflammatory and infectious processes such as mucocele, polyp, and pyogenic granuloma; benign neoplasms such as infantile hemangioma and juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma; malignant lesions such as rhabdomyosarcoma and nasopharyngeal carcinoma; and masses related to prior trauma such as septal hematoma. Although direct visualization, without imaging, is frequently sufficient to diagnose pediatric nasal conditions, in many cases imaging has a key role in the treatment of the affected child. Some of these lesions have characteristic computed tomography and/or magnetic resonance imaging findings, some of them are diagnosed on the basis of the location and imaging findings combined, and others demonstrate nonspecific imaging findings. However, imaging is important for better defining the total extent of the lesion and guiding the clinician in determining whether medical and/or surgical intervention is required. In this article, the authors review the imaging findings of the most common causes-and many of the not-so-common causes-of nasal masses encountered in the pediatric population. © RSNA, 2017.

### Clinical practice guideline: improving nasal form and function after rhinoplasty [^1149ByBW]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Statement 3 — nasal airway obstruction evaluation for rhinoplasty candidates — states that the surgeon, or the surgeon's designee, should evaluate the rhinoplasty candidate for nasal airway obstruction during the preoperative assessment, with a recommendation based on observational studies, with a preponderance of benefit over harm. The action statement profile specifies aggregate evidence quality as Grade C and level of confidence in evidence as High, cites benefits to avoid overlooking nasal airway obstruction, refine the surgical plan, identify deviated nasal septum or nasal valve collapse and nonanatomic causes including inflammatory disorders, neoplastic disorders, and obstructing adenoids, notes risks and costs including cost and adverse events of diagnostic procedures (endoscopy, imaging), time spent in evaluating the patient, and potential for focusing attention on incidental or asymptomatic findings, and concludes with a benefit–harm assessment of preponderance of benefit over harm.

### Budesonide (Rhinocort aqua) [^116psfcz]. FDA (2012). Low credibility.

5.1 Local Nasal Effects

Epistaxis

In clinical studies of 3 to 52 weeks' duration epistaxis was observed more frequently in patients treated with RHINOCORT AQUA Nasal Spray than those who received placebo [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

Candida Infection

In clinical studies with budesonide administered intranasally, the development of localized infections of the nose and pharynx with Candida albicans has occurred. When such an infection develops, it may require treatment with appropriate local or systemic therapy and discontinuation of treatment with RHINOCORT AQUA Nasal Spray. Patients using RHINOCORT AQUA Nasal Spray over several months or longer should be examined periodically for evidence of Candida infection or other signs of adverse effects on the nasal mucosa.

Nasal Septal Perforation

Instances of nasal septum perforation have been reported following the intranasal application of corticosteroids, including budesonide [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

Impaired Wound Healing

Because of the inhibitory effect of corticosteroids on wound healing, patients who have experienced recent nasal septal ulcers, nasal surgery, or nasal trauma should not use a nasal corticosteroid until healing has occurred.

5.2 Hypersensitivity Reactions Including Anaphylaxis

Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylactic reaction, urticaria, rash, dermatitis, angioedema and pruritus may occur [see Contraindications (4) and Adverse Reactions, Post-marketing Experience (6.2)].

### Congenital and acquired lesions of the nasal septum: a practical guide for differential diagnosis [^113fhnJj]. Radiographics (2008). Low credibility.

Many different types of lesions may involve the nasal septum, and some can destroy it. Congenital nasal septal anomalies are rare and tend to have fairly typical imaging features, which, when considered alongside the imaging appearance of the normal anatomy, help determine the correct diagnosis in most instances. By contrast, many acquired lesions have nonspecific imaging features, and their diagnosis therefore must be based also on the patient's age and the histologic findings. Acquired nasal septal abnormalities may be caused by trauma, infection, toxicity, inflammation, or tumors. Traumatic lesions may result from surgery or from repetitive behaviors such as rhinotillexomania. Frequent use of decongestants and cocaine also may erode the nasal septum. Bacteria, mycobacteria, and fungi may cause infections of the nasal septum, particularly in immunocompromised patients. Inflammatory diseases that may affect the nasal septum include sarcoidosis, reparative granuloma, and Wegener granulomatosis. Last, the tumors that may arise in the nasal septum or may involve it secondarily include carcinomas, Pindborg tumor, sarcoma, angiofibroma, hemangioma, neuroendocrine tumor, and schwannoma.

### Clinical practice guideline: improving nasal form and function after rhinoplasty [^112Vy9Bw]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Rhinoplasty guideline terminology — Table 1 defines key terms used in this guideline, including rhinoplasty, aesthetic, cosmetic, body dysmorphic disorder (BDD), rhinitis, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), nasal cycle, anterior rhinoscopy, and nasal packing. Rhinoplasty is described as a surgical procedure that alters the shape or appearance of the nose while preserving or enhancing the nasal airway, and the primary reason for surgery can be aesthetic, functional, or both and may include adjunctive procedures on the septum, turbinates, or paranasal sinuses. Aesthetic is defined as concerned with beauty or the appreciation of beauty, while cosmetic relates to treatment intended to restore or improve appearance. BDD is a psychiatric disorder consisting of distressing or impairing preoccupation with nonexistent or slight defects in one's appearance. Rhinitis is inflammation of the mucous membranes of the nose frequently caused by infection or allergic reaction. OSA is defined by a sleep disorder involving at least 5 obstructive respiratory events per hour. The nasal cycle is the often unnoticed alternating partial congestion and decongestion of the nasal cavities in humans and other animals. Anterior rhinoscopy refers to examination of the anterior part of the nose, including the inferior turbinate, the septum, and the nasal valves. Nasal packing is material placed inside the nose to promote hemostasis, structural support, and reduction of scar formation, with traditional examples including ribbon gauze, expandable nonbiodegradable pads, and nonstick dressing material, and Silastic stents or nasal splints and custom-cut sheeting are not considered packing.

### Enlarged vomeronasal organ in a child: imaging findings [^114Ss3oP]. Clinical Imaging (2004). Low credibility.

The vomeronasal organ is a special sensory organ that exists in both animals and humans. It is located on the sides of nasal septum and although it involutes with age, occasionally it may be seen in humans. We present the imaging findings in a child with an enlarged nasal septum whose features we believe are compatible with a vomeronasal organ.

### Nasal septal abscess following septoplasty in a patient with type 2 diabetes mellitus [^116i3UFe]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). High credibility.

A man in his 50s with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) presented with a nasal septal abscess 3weeks following septoplasty. Diabetes mellitus has been reported in association with nasal septal abscess, thought to be due to a relative immunodeficient state. We present an unusual, delayed presentation of nasal septal abscess following septoplasty and performed a literature review. Nasal septal abscess is rare. It is associated with significant complications if not diagnosed and management expediently. The association between T2DM and nasal septal abscess following septoplasty emphasises the importance of good perioperative blood sugar control and postoperative nasal care and raises the question of empirical antibiotics in this group.

### The utility of enlarging symptomatic nasal septal perforations [^113HTxMA]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Nasal septal perforations cause a subset of patients to suffer with significant impairments in quality of life. While smaller perforations can often be surgically repaired, perforations exceeding 2 cm are challenging to close. These repairs are highly technical, and there is a lack of consensus regarding the most effective means to do so. The authors performed a retrospective chart review of patients with perforation enlargements and have found that, in select patients, enlarging the septal perforation's edge posterior to the head of the middle turbinates has proven effective in relieving symptoms.

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis update [^112K1rtP]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) — management when initial antibiotic therapy fails includes counseling and reassessment. During initial management, patients should be counseled to call and/or schedule a follow up appointment if symptoms are worsening or not improving after 3 to 5 days on appropriate initial antibiotic therapy, and clinicians should confirm the diagnosis of ABRS by applying the diagnostic criteria in Table 4. If the patient does not have the symptom cluster of up to 4 weeks of purulent nasal drainage alongside nasal obstruction, facial pain-pressure-fullness, or both, alternate diagnoses should be explored; common mimics include migraines, tension headaches, cluster headaches, temporomandibular joint disorders, and noninfectious nasal conditions such as allergic rhinitis, vasomotor rhinitis, deviated nasal septum, and nasal valve collapse. The presence of purulent or discolored drainage from the middle meatus or sphenoethmoid recess is suggestive of a bacterial process; a culture may help direct appropriate antibiotic therapy if purulent drainage is identified, but blind nasal or nasopharyngeal swabs are not recommended, and such cultures should be taken from the middle meatus or sphenoethmoid recess.

### The eye is a common site of granulomatosis with polyangiitis. A collaborative study [^115NMb5S]. BMC Ophthalmology (2023). Medium credibility.

Upper or/and lower airway symptoms included nasal, sinus, and pulmonary abnormalities, occurring in isolation or in variable combinations. The ENT system was involved in 17 of the 22 patients (77%); the clinical features included bloody nasal discharge, nasal crusts and/or ulcers, and sinusitis. In 2 patients, the inflammatory and granulomatous processes led to perforation of the nasal septum (Fig. 3 a) and consequent saddle nose deformity. 11 patients (50%) presented with pulmonary symptoms of variable severity, ranging from persistent cough and hemoptysis to cavitating pulmonary lesions (Fig. 3 b–d) and patchy or diffuse ground-glass opacities. Histopathologic examination of surgically achieved lung tissue showed granulomatous inflammation, stenotic involvement of the vascular lumen, infiltration of immune cells surrounding the vessels and disruption of the vascular wall (Fig. 4).

### Abscess on the nasal tip of a young woman [^1123HCFs]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Answers:
A. Direct skin-to-skin contact – Incorrect. While some Streptococcus species can be transmitted through skin contact, GBS is more often spread via mucosal or genital contact. Skin-to-skin transmission is less likely in this case, given the microbiologic findings and the patient's sexual history.
B. Sexual transmission – Correct. The patient has a localized abscess caused by Group B Streptococcus (GBS). GBS is commonly associated with genital and gastrointestinal tract colonization. Sexual transmission explains the chronicity of the nasal lesion, with a "ping-pong" effect due to reinfection between the patient and her partner. The partner's confirmed GBS colonization supports this mode of transmission.
C. Infected arthropod bite – Incorrect. Arthropod bites can become infected by pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes. However, GBS is primarily associated with mucosal colonization and is not commonly linked to insect bites, making this explanation unlikely.
D. Fomite transmission – Incorrect. Although fomites can transmit certain infections, this is not a typical mode for GBS. The patient's lesion and sexual history strongly suggest direct, intimate contact, not indirect exposure through inanimate objects.
E. Autoinoculation from asymptomatic colonization – Incorrect. Airborne transmission is characteristic of respiratory pathogens like Streptococcus pneumoniae, not GBS. GBS is primarily spread through direct contact, particularly in the genital or mucosal regions, making this mode of transmission highly improbable. Oro-genital sexual transmission aligns with the patient's history, microbiologic findings, and the chronicity of the lesion.

Question 2: During the sexual health history, the clinician asks, "Do you have any current partners? What genders are your partners?" The patient becomes hesitant and expresses concern about how the information will be used. What is the most appropriate response by the clinician to maintain an affirming approach?
A. Reassure the patient that their information is needed solely to determine sexually transmitted infection (STI) risk
B. Apologize and move on, avoiding further discussion about their sexual history to preserve trust
C. Acknowledge the patient's concern, explain the purpose of the questions in understanding health risks, and invite them to share as much as they feel comfortable
D. Ask if the patient has ever been tested for STIs and skip further details about their sexual practices
E. Validate the patient's feelings, clarify that their responses will remain confidential, and recommend you discuss this at her next visit

### Diagnosis and management of rhinosinusitis: a practice parameter update [^116FCuZL]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Pediatric rhinosinusitis — presentation and diagnostic considerations emphasize symptom patterns and practical examination limits. As to symptoms, cough is a prominent symptom. The frequency of upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) in children is higher than that in adults and therefore has a greater impact on rhinosinusitis in children. Some younger children might not tolerate nasal endoscopy, and clinicians are sometimes hindered in their physical examination and have to rely on history and on imaging studies for appropriate diagnosis. Unilateral nasal drainage in children should alert the clinician to the possible differential diagnosis of unilateral choanal atresia and nasal foreign body.

### Fluticasone propionate (Xhance) [^113JtQwz]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.1 Local Nasal Adverse Reactions

Epistaxis, Nasal Erosions and Ulcerations

In placebo-controlled clinical trials of 16 weeks duration, epistaxis, nasal erosions, and nasal ulcerations were reported more frequently in patients treated with XHANCE than those who received placebo [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

Nasal Septal Perforation

Nasal septal perforations have been reported in patients following the nasal application of XHANCE. In placebo-controlled clinical trials of 16 weeks duration, nasal septal perforation was reported in 1 (0.3%) patient treated with XHANCE compared with none treated with placebo. The patient had a prior history of nasal/sinus surgery. Three (0.3%) patients treated with XHANCE in uncontrolled, open-label trials of 3 to 12 months duration developed nasal septal perforations.

As with any long term topical treatment of the nasal cavity, patients using XHANCE over several months or longer should be examined periodically for possible changes in the nasal mucosa. If a septal perforation is noted, discontinue XHANCE. Avoid spraying XHANCE directly on the septum.

Candida Infection

In clinical trials with XHANCE, localized infections with Candida albicans have been observed. Eight (0.9%) patients in uncontrolled, open-label trials of 3 to 12 months duration developed Candida albicans infections (nasal, pharyngeal, esophageal or intestinal). If such an infection develops, it may require treatment with appropriate local therapy and discontinuation of XHANCE. Patients using XHANCE should be examined periodically for evidence of Candida infection in the nasal and oropharyngeal mucosa.

Impaired Wound Healing

Because of the inhibitory effect of corticosteroids on wound healing, patients who have experienced recent nasal ulcerations, nasal surgery, or nasal trauma should avoid using XHANCE until healing has occurred.

### Clinical practice guideline: nosebleed (epistaxis) [^1136r7jC]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2020). High credibility.

Pediatric nasal foreign body — epistaxis and complications: Nasal foreign bodies are a common issue in children, and delay in diagnosis is not uncommon; in a large case series, epistaxis was the presenting symptom in 7% of patients with a nasal foreign body, and bleeding was associated with the presence of a nasal foreign body or with removal of the foreign body in 30% of the cases. Delay in diagnosis can result in morbidity, including nasal infection, sinusitis, and nasal septal perforations or synechiae, and when the undetected foreign body is a disk battery, septal perforation can occur in as little as 3 hours. Nasal endoscopy may allow rapid and complete nasal examination to exclude foreign body not seen with anterior rhinoscopy.

### Point-of-care ultrasound of a nasal septal abscess [^113p3euP]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Although nasal septal abscesses (NSA) are rare, complications can be significant and devastating. Thus, timely diagnosis of NSA is critical. In this case report, we describe the use of point-of-care ultrasound in diagnosing NSA in a healthy boy presenting with viral upper respiratory infection symptoms and fever. Point-of-care ultrasound findings resulted in expediting this patient's treatment and transfer to a quaternary care center for definitive treatment.

### Pediatric nasal septal perforation secondary to magnet misuse: a case report [^116NYv1T]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2007). Low credibility.

We describe the case of a 7-year-old girl who had placed magnetic earrings bilaterally on her nasal ala. However, the two backing magnets that had been placed inside the nasal cavity became attached to each other rather than to the outer jewelry, compressing the nasal septum. Several weeks later, the septum became perforated. The patient was treated conservatively with mupirocin ointment, oral amoxicillin, and nasal saline. Subsequent examinations revealed no enlargement of the perforation, and the patient was followed conservatively with saline nasal spray.

We also reviewed the literatures in recent years and summarized the characteristics of NSA, such as gender, age, inducement, pathogenic bacteria, treatment, and prognosis. We found that this boy reported by us has the most extensive abscess. May be the delay of treatment was related to the recent fluctuation of COVID-19 epidemic in China. Fortunately, with the help of surgery and anti-infection treatment, the boy was discharged from the hospital without septal perforation or saddle nose.

Paranasal sinus development and pneumatisation variants are described, and rhinosinusitis and different patterns of inflammatory sinonasal diseases are reviewed. Other inflammatory sinonasal diseases, e.g., fungal sinusitis, mucocele, pyocele and sinonasal manifestations in systemic diseases, are briefly described. Computed tomography (CT) is the primary modality in diagnosing and mapping suspected inflammatory sinonasal disease. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is complementary to CT if fungal sinusitis, pyocele or malignancy are suspected.

### Abscess on the nasal tip of a young woman [^115zMG3e]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Answers:
A. Reassure the patient that their information is needed solely to determine STI risk – Incorrect. Focusing solely on STI risk does not address the broader importance of sexual health and may make the patient feel their concerns about identity and confidentiality are not fully respected.
B. Apologize and move on, avoiding further discussion about their sexual history to preserve trust – Incorrect. Avoiding the discussion misses an opportunity to affirm the patient's identity, address health concerns comprehensively, and build trust.
C. Acknowledge the patient's concern, explain the purpose of the questions in understanding health risks, and invite them to share as much as they feel comfortable – Correct. This response is culturally competent, acknowledges the patient's hesitation, and transparently explains the medical relevance of the questions while empowering the patient to decide how much to share. It fosters trust and ensures the patient feels respected and in control.
D. Ask if the patient has ever been tested for STIs and skip further details about their sexual practices – Incorrect. Skipping details about sexual practices risks missing important health information and perpetuates assumptions, potentially compromising care.
E. Validate the patient's feelings, clarify that their responses will remain confidential, and recommend you discuss this at her next visit – Incorrect. Validating concerns and reassuring confidentiality are important, but this response does not fully explain the medical purpose of the questions nor allow her the chance to share today.

### Nasal septal ulceration [^117QDxko]. Clinics in Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Nasal septal ulceration can have multiple etiologies. Determining the exact cause depends on who the consulting specialist is, who could either be the ENT surgeon or the dermatologist. The common causes are infections (tuberculosis, leprosy, leishmaniasis), vasculitis (Wegener's granulomatosis and Churg-Strauss syndrome), and lupus erythematosus. Traumatic causes and malignancy can also be seen in tertiary referral centers. The diagnosis often requires thorough investigations and multiple tissue specimens from various sites, and in chronic cases, a suspicion of lymphoma should be considered. Apart from disease-specific therapy, a multidisciplinary approach is required in most cases to tackle the cosmetic disfigurement.

### Trilayer temporalis fascia interposition graft for nasal septal perforation repair: a continued experience [^117DiZvs]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

All patients within this study experienced an improvement in their pre‐existing symptoms associated with NSP. Specifically, the majority of patients experienced complete resolution of their prior symptoms (n = 44, 78.6%), with the remaining 12 patients (21.4%) experiencing partial resolution. In patients who did not experience complete resolution of symptoms, nasal obstruction was the most cited persistent symptom (n = 9), followed by crusting (n = 3). When examining patients with persistent nasal obstruction, septal thickening was noted on nasal endoscopy in 77.8% (n = 7). Importantly, no patients with persistent nasal obstruction required additional surgical intervention to address these symptoms. Among patients with persistent crusting, one patient reported continued nasal picking, and another was noncompliant with the use of nasal irrigations/emollient post‐operatively.

One patient within the study demonstrated the persistence of a partial NSP following the trilayer temporalis fascia interposition graft. This was discovered at the patient's four‐month post‐operative appointment. Despite this, the patient experienced partial improvement in symptoms, reduction in size of perforation, and ultimately did not elect to pursue additional repair. When examining factors associated with lack of complete symptom resolution (Table 2), no statistically significant relationships between patient age, suspected cause of perforation, size of perforation, location of perforation, prior nasal surgery, prior nasal steroid use, concomitant nasal procedure, duration of antibiotics, or duration of splinting was found.

Table 2
Factors Associated With Partial Resolution of Symptoms and Postoperative Complications

A minority of patients in this cohort experienced postoperative complications (n = 8, 14.3%). These included post‐operative infection (n = 3, 5.4%), synechiae requiring lysis (n = 2, 3.6%), nasal hemorrhage (n = 1, 1.8%), incomplete repair of the perforation (n = 1), delayed healing presenting as septal thickening and cartilage irregularity (n = 1, 1.8%), and dehiscence of the temporalis fascia harvest site (n = 1). Patients who did not have a history of prior intranasal steroid use (n = 21, 37.5%) had a statistically higher rate of complication (p = 0.0423) (Table 2). No patients required revision trilayer grafting for repair of NSP. The median length of follow‐up in this study was 257 days (range 65‐1724).

### Rhinolithiasis with a nasal polyp: a case report [^1144vR7Q]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2008). Low credibility.

Rhinoliths are uncommon mineralized masses that form as a result of calcification of an endogenous or exogenous nidus. The most common manifestations of rhinolithiasis are unilateral nasal discharge, nasal obstruction, and facial pain. The diagnosis is made by nasal endoscopy and computed tomography. The differential diagnosis includes chronic inflammation, osteomyelitis, benign tumors (e.g., calcified nasal polyps, ossifying fibromas, osteomas, and chondromas), and malignant tumors (e.g., osteosarcomas, chondrosarcomas, and squamous cell carcinomas). Rhinoliths may cause rhinosinusitis, erosion of the nasal septum and medial wall of the maxillary sinus, and perforations of the palate. To the best of our knowledge, the occurrence of a nasal polyp associated with rhinolithiasis has not been previously reported in the English-language literature. In this article, we describe such a case.

### Numerical simulation of airflow patterns in nose models with differently localized septal perforations [^115UaDTp]. The Laryngoscope (2013). Low credibility.

Objectives/Hypothesis

The most typical complaints of patients with nasal septal perforation (SP) are nasal obstruction, crusting, and recurrent epistaxis depending on the size and site of the SP mainly due to disturbed airflow patterns. The objective of the study was to determine the influence of differently localized SPs on intranasal airflow patterns during inspiration by means of numerical simulation.

Study Design

An experimental setup using three dimensional computer models of a human nose was created. Four different models with three differently localized septal perforation allowed an examination of intranasal airflow changes.

Methods

Four high-resolution, realistic, bilateral computer models of the human nose with three differently localized SPs were reconstructed based on computed tomography. A numerical simulation was performed. The intranasal airflow patterns (path lines, velocity, turbulent kinetic energy) during inspiration were displayed, analyzed, and compared.

Results

SPs cause a highly disturbed airflow in the area of the SP and behind. A spacious vortex within the perforation, including various localized vortices, was detected. The airflow in the nose was disturbed to varying degrees depending on the location of the perforation. SPs within the anterior caudal septum in area II led to increased negative turbulences and crossflow.

Conclusions

The numerical simulations demonstrate significantly disturbed intranasal airflow patterns due to SPs. This fact may contribute to crusting and nosebleed due to dehydration of the nasal mucosa. The location and size of the SP are crucial for the impact on disturbed airflow pattern and therefore the patients' complaints. Anterior caudal SPs seem to be the worst. Surgical closure of SPs or simply changes in the site and size of the SP if a complete closure is surgically impossible makes sense.

### Case report of nasal rhinosporidiosis in South Africa [^116wyF3w]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

The Study

We diagnosed the patient with HIV (viral load 6,060 copies/mL, CD4+ T-cell count 570 cells/mm³) and initiated antiretroviral therapy. She had no other underlying conditions or notable medical history and reported no international travel or contact with animals. She denied swimming in any water sources or using river or freestanding water for day-to-day purposes; she also denied interacting with any contacts, either in Soweto or Mthatha, with similar complaints or tuberculosis.

On examination, we found a nontender, 5 mm, mobile, polypoid mass in the right nostril that appeared to adhere to the anterior, superior aspect of the nasal septum near the mucocutaneous junction. Results from the remainder of her ear, nose, and throat examination, as well as examinations of her eyes and pharynx, were unremarkable. We found no cervical lymphadenopathy.

We initiated treatment with oral amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and requested a computed tomography scan of the head and neck to assess the vascularity and amenability for biopsy of the mass. The scan showed a nonenhancing, soft tissue mass in the right nasal vestibule arising from the anterior septum (Appendix Figure 1). A sample of the friable mass from the biopsy sent for histologic examination revealed multiple, variously sized, spherical subepidermal structures, the largest with thickened walls. Contents varied from a single, central acidophilic structure to numerous basophilic spheres that developed centripetally (Figure 1).

### Nasal septal abscess developed after radiofrequency cauterization for epistaxis [^114iefAc]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Nasal septal abscesses are commonly caused by nasal trauma, infection, and nasal surgery. As delayed treatment of nasal septal abscesses can cause various complications, including saddle nose, a prompt diagnosis with the relevant intervention is important. However, the diagnosis of nasal septal abscesses is difficult when nasal pain occurs after cauterization because there have been no formal reports of nasal septal abscesses owing to cauterization for epistaxis. Here, the authors report the first case of a nasal septal abscess that developed after cauterization. A 48-year-old woman underwent radiofrequency cauterization as a treatment for epistaxis. She developed nasal pain 10 days following cauterization, and a computed tomography scan revealed a nasal septal abscess. Careful observation should be undertaken in patients who undergo cauterization of the nasal septum, especially in patients complaining of nasal pain.

IDSA/ASTMH cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) monitoring and consequences — Potential consequences of inadequate treatment include poor cosmetic outcome due to scarring or superinfection, persistence of a chronic wound(s), and, with some Leishmania species, destructive and disfiguring mucosal leishmaniasis (ML); in immunocompromised persons, cutaneous, mucosal, and visceral dissemination may occur (fact, no grade). Persons with CL should be actively monitored by clinical appearance, including careful nasal and oropharyngeal examination periodically up to 1 year, or at least 2 years if at increased risk for ML, and educated to seek medical attention anytime signs or symptoms of relapse or ML appear (strong, low). Symptoms such as chronic nasal stuffiness, epistaxis, hoarseness, or findings such as septal perforation in anyone with a prior or current diagnosis of CL or a scar consistent with prior CL should prompt evaluation for ML, including fiber-optic examination of the affected area if relevant (strong, moderate).

### Unusual causes of nasal septal abscess including a COVID-19 swab test after nasal surgery [^112RPwaZ]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

A nasal septal abscess is a rare lesion that usually results from a nasal septal hematoma after nasal trauma or surgery, although it can occur unexpectedly. Nasal septal abscesses should be prevented and treated immediately. The authors describe 2 unusual cases: 1 caused by sudden loosening of the quilting suture of the nasal septum and the other by a nasopharyngeal swab test for coronavirus disease-2019. The authors also provide an intraoperative video and a literature review.

### Nasal septum perforation: a side effect of bevacizumab chemotherapy in breast cancer patients [^113F8mZd]. British Journal of Cancer (2010). Low credibility.

Discussion

This study reports our experience of nasal septum perforations in breast cancer pts receiving bevacizumab and chemotherapy. The incidence rate of nasal septum perforation was 7.14%. To our knowledge, such a high rate has never been reported and might be underestimated.

To our knowledge, only eight cases of nasal septum perforation in bevacizumab-treated pts have been reported. The clinical characteristics are summarised in Table 2. There are two cases of breast cancer, five cases of colon cancer and one case of ovarian cancer.

Nasal septum perforations with bevacizumab can thus occur independently of the chemotherapy regimen (LV5FU2, FOLFOX, paclitaxel) and sometimes during maintenance therapy with bevacizumab. The total dose exposure before perforation varies from 30 to 150 mg kg⁻¹.

The management is not clearly defined. In some cases bevacizumab was discontinued. We do not know whether bevacizumab must be stopped or which treatment should be proposed.

ENT monitoring and evolution of the perforation (size, long term symptoms,…) are not detailed. In one case, plastic surgery was performed.

Nasal septum consists of an osteochondral skeleton covered with periosteum, perichondrum and mucosa. Its vascularisation depends on several arteries: the sphenopalatine artery, a branch of the external carotid artery, the anterior and posterior ethmoidal artery, branches of the internal carotid artery. The anterior part of the nasal septum is highly vascularised with arterial anastomoses. Risk factors for nasal septum perforations are traumatic injury, intranasal drug use, inhaled irritants, inflammatory diseases and infections. Cocaine and other similar drugs are potent vasoconstrictors, which if applied on the mucosa of the nasal septum may cause intense inflammation, congestion and bacterial colonisation. This can lead to ischaemic necrosis of the septal cartilage. Inhalation of chemical irritants (chromium, dust and metal oxide.) causes irritation and severe inflammation of the nasal mucosa responsible for ulcerations, which can lead to perforation of the nasal septum.

### Septic arthritis: a unique complication of nasal septal abscess [^113P6oQ1]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Nasal septal abscesses (NSAs) occur between the mucoperichondrium and the nasal septum. They most often arise when an untreated septal hematoma becomes infected. The most commonly reported sequela is a loss of septal cartilage support, which can result in a nasal deformity. Other sequelae include potentially life-threatening conditions such as meningitis, cavernous sinus thrombosis, brain abscess, and subarachnoid empyema. We report the case of a 17-year-old boy who developed an NSA after he had been struck in the face with a basketball. He presented to his primary care physician 5 days after the injury and again the next day, but his condition was not correctly diagnosed. Finally, 7 days after his injury, he presented to an emergency department with more serious symptoms, and he was correctly diagnosed with NSA. He was admitted to the intensive care unit, and he remained hospitalized for 6 days. Among the abscess sequelae he experienced was septic arthritis, which has heretofore not been reported as a complication of NSA. He responded well to appropriate treatment, although he lost a considerable amount of septal cartilage. He was discharged home on intravenous antibiotic therapy, and his condition improved. Reconstruction of the nasal septum will likely need to be pursued in the future.

### Diagnosis and management of rhinosinusitis: a practice parameter update [^112MnBhX]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Recurrent acute rhinosinusitis (RARS) — examination and endoscopy guidance includes that "the physical examination should be modified to evaluate for signs of immunodeficiency… complications of primary infections… CF… ciliary dysfunction… and anatomic abnormalities (eg, septal deviation, nasal polyps, foreign bodies, and tumors)". For selected patients, "diagnostic nasal endoscopy should be considered". Rigid endoscopy "provides greater image quality and allows the examiner to perform procedures, such as culture, biopsy, or injection", while flexible telescopes "can visualize the nasal and nasopharyngeal regions" and additional upper aerodigestive structures. Notably, "endoscopic visualization of a sinus lumen is typically not possible unless the patient has had prior surgical sinusotomy or an accessory ostium is present".

### Abscess on the nasal tip of a young woman [^112j5bxh]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Question 3: What is the most appropriate next step in management?
A. Incision and drainage of the patient's lesion and treating her partner with penicillin
B. Empiric treatment with oral terbinafine and obtaining a fungal culture
C. Treating the patient with topical mupirocin ointment and warm compresses
D. Performing a biopsy of the lesion and sending tissue for histopathologic examination
E. Treating the patient with oral clindamycin for gram-positive coverage

Answers:
A. Incision and drainage of the patient's lesion and treating her partner with penicillin – Correct. Abscesses caused by GBS often require incision and drainage, as antibiotics alone may not suffice. Additionally, the patient's partner is an asymptomatic carrier likely reinfecting the patient, so penicillin treatment is appropriate.
B. Empiric treatment with oral terbinafine and obtaining a fungal culture – Incorrect. Although fungal infections can present as refractory nodules, the culture results showing beta-hemolytic, Christie-Atkins-Munch-Petersen-positive gram-positive cocci strongly indicate a bacterial, not fungal, etiology. Oral terbinafine is not warranted here.
C. Treating the patient with topical mupirocin ointment and warm compresses – Incorrect. While topical antibiotics can be effective for superficial bacterial infections, this patient's chronic and refractory nodule suggests a deeper infection requiring more invasive management, such as incision and drainage and systemic antibiotic therapy.
D. Performing a biopsy of the lesion and sending tissue for histopathologic examination – Incorrect. A biopsy could be considered if there was suspicion of an atypical lesion (eg, malignancy or granulomatous infection). However, in this case, the diagnosis is clear based on the culture and clinical features, making biopsy unnecessary as the first-line step.
E. Treating the patient with oral clindamycin for gram-positive coverage – Incorrect. Although clindamycin provides effective gram-positive coverage, incision and drainage is critical in managing abscesses. Treating the partner is also essential to prevent reinfection, which clindamycin alone does not address.

### A 52-year-old man with a chronic nasal wound [^113dwqvg]. NEJM Evidence (2024). Medium credibility.

AbstractMorning Report is a time-honored tradition where physicians-in-training present cases to their colleagues and clinical experts to collaboratively examine an interesting patient presentation. The Morning Report section seeks to carry on this tradition by presenting a patient's chief concern and story, inviting the reader to develop a differential diagnosis and discover the diagnosis alongside the authors of the case. This report examines the story of a 52-year-old man who sought evaluation for a chronic nasal lesion that had eroded into his nasal septum. Using questions, physical examination, and testing, an illness script for the presentation emerges. As the clinical course progresses, the differential is refined until a diagnosis is made.

Indications for surgical intervention (Table 10): Surgical consideration includes "When nasal polyps obstruct sinus drainage or cause significant nasal congestion and persist despite appropriate medical treatment" and "When there is persistent or persistent infectious rhinosinusitis despite adequate trials of medical management that at least includes topical nasal steroids and nasal irrigations; in many cases, ≥ 1 course of antibiotics is required, chosen to cover the spectrum of pathogens anticipated to be causing the disease, and a course of oral steroids may be considered if there is no contraindication". Additional indications include "For biopsy of sinonasal tissue to rule out granulomatous disease, neoplasm, ciliary dyskinesia, or fungal infections", "When maxillary antral puncture is required (eg, for culture-directed therapy)", and "For rhinosinusitis with threatened complications (eg, threat of brain abscess, meningitis, cavernous sinus thrombosis, or frontal bone osteomyelitis)".

### Nasal septum perforation: a side effect of bevacizumab chemotherapy in breast cancer patients [^113LzBBd]. British Journal of Cancer (2010). Low credibility.

Nasal septum infection weakens the nasal mucosa and then can be responsible for perforation. Various systemic diseases can also cause nasal septal perforation (Wegener's granulomatosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, antiphospholipid syndrom, sarcoidosis…). Mechanisms involved are ischaemic, infections and inflammatory.

also noted that 3% of NSP may be completely asymptomatic and discovered during a consultation for another reason.

In our pts receiving antiangiogenic therapy and chemotherapy, several specific mechanisms could be involved. First, mucositis induced by chemotherapy may weaken nasal mucosa. Nasal irritation due to chemotherapy induced mucositis and/or bevacizumab may induce mucosal breaks and ulcerations. These irritations can be increased by frequent nose blowing and mechanical trauma. Neutropenia frequently associated with chemotherapy enhance the risk of local infection. Bevacizumab decreases normal tissue repair. Bleeding could be seen because of the effect of bevacizumab in wound healing. The inhibition of VEGF can induce a loss of capillaries by apoptosis of endothelial cells, which causes tissue necrosis. Cartilage is not vascularised. The trophicity is maintained by factors from capillaries of mucosa via a terminal vascularisation. In the weakened mucosa, the trophicity of the cartilage might no longer be obtained.

Finally, in our study, bevacizumab was associated with taxanes in most cases. Several studies have shown the antiangiogenic action of taxanes. Docetaxel appears to be more potent than Paclitaxel. Endothelial cells seem to be 10–100-fold more sensitive to taxanes than tumour cells. Furthermore, two cases of nasal septum perforations have already been described with Docetaxel alone in pts without risk factors. A case of thrombotic microangiopathy following docetaxel has been reported. This endothelial toxicity of taxanes might explain potentialisation of bevacizumab by taxanes in terms of efficiency, but also of toxicity including nasal septum perforation. To our knowledge, no other cases of nasal septum perforation with chemotherapy alone have been reported.

A high incidence of nasal septum perforation has been shown in pts with breast cancer receiving bevacizumab. Many questions remain about the prevention and the management of nasal septum perforation. A collaboration with ENT specialist is needed. Whether or not bevacizumab should be stopped remains a matter of debate. In the clinical practise, indication of antiangiogenic therapy in breast cancer is increasing and many pts are concerned, and clinicians must be aware of this side effect. ENT examinations must be systematically performed in all pts receiving bevacizumab, at least together with taxanes.

### Nasal septal and mucosal disease associated with pyoderma gangrenosum in a cocaine user [^116CjBzu]. JAAD Case Reports (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

Our patient had unusual sites of PG — nose and upper back — and poor response to standard treatment. Head and neck involvement in PG occurs in 5% of all PG cases. Nasal involvement with PG is rarely reported and can involve the nasal septum and bridge of the nose leading to septal perforation and saddle nose deformity. After excluding infections, inflammatory bowel disease, hematological malignancy, and medications associated with PG, granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) was considered.

In all cases of head and neck involvement in PG, GPA must be excluded, as necrotizing ulcerations occur in both diseases. In a series of 244 patients with GPA, prevalence of cutaneous manifestations varied from 4.4% in limited form of the disease to 40% in the generalized form. Skin manifestations can also be an initial presentation of GPA in approximately 10% of patients. Histopathologically, findings of granulomatous vasculitis, palisading granuloma, and abscess with granuloma formation have been described in GPA. In our case, distinction from GPA was aided by the absence of histologic features and a negative anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody test result.

We then hypothesized malignant pyoderma (MP) as a diagnostic consideration. The term MP is used to describe an idiopathic necrotizing ulceration with predilection for the face and preauricular area. MP further differs from classic PG by the absence of undermining borders, poor responsiveness to treatment, and higher tendency to relapse. Some authors consider MP a cutaneous manifestation of GPA.

Although, our case could be considered as MP because of facial distribution and poor responsiveness to treatment, the presence of an undermining border on the upper back lesion argued against MP. Based on our patient's clinical presentation, history of drug use, and exclusion of systemic diseases associated with PG, we finally concluded that levamisole-tainted cocaine use was the etiology of PG and nasal septum perforation.

### Nasal pemphigoid: a diagnostic dilemma [^1114C1g5]. BMJ Case Reports (2012). Medium credibility.

Cicatricial pemphigoid is a chronic, systemic, immunobullous disorder affecting mucous membranes. Nasal manifestations of cicatricial pemphigoid are less common than in the rest of the upper aero-digestive tract, and may prove difficult to diagnose and manage effectively. We report one such case presenting with isolated nasal symptoms, in which diagnosis, treatment and ongoing management of the underlying cause was particularly challenging. A literature review was performed to ascertain the incidence of cicatricial pemphigoid and to establish the best evidence-based investigation and treatment.

Case report

A 53-year-old white woman with history of type 1 diabetes mellitus and recreational drug abuse presented to the dermatology department with a 6-month history of a painful, nonhealing ulcerated lesion on the back. The lesion was initially diagnosed as an abscess, and repeat incision and drainage, oral antibiotics, and supportive wound care failed (Fig 1). Tissue cultures for bacteria and fungus were negative. The patient underwent excision and repair. Histopathologic examination found ulceration with undermining of adjacent skin and acute suppurative and plasma cell–rich inflammatory infiltrates (Fig 2). The repair began to dehisce centrally, resulting in an 8.5- × 1.0-cm linear, focally ulcerating, and violaceous plaque with several areas of focal suppurative discharge (Fig 3).

The patient was also found to have beefy red friable and focally pustular soft tissue swelling of the nasal mucosa (Fig 4). Results of a nasal swab culture were consistent with secondary colonization. Punch biopsy found an acute suppurative folliculitis, with follicular rupture and destruction (Fig 5). Nasoendoscopy found mucosal edema, ulceration of bilateral nasal passages, and a large nasal septum perforation. The changes of skin on the back were diagnosed as PG and those of the nasal mucosa as early lesions of PG.

### Sinusitis and fever of unknown origin [^1177GUqu]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

It is relatively uncommon to document sinusitis as a cause of fever with much certainty. Therefore, investigation for sinusitis should be undertaken only after more likely causes have been excluded. and the actions taken should reflect the individual patient's circumstances. Aggressive evaluation and treatment should be geared to minimizing the patient's overall morbidity and to identifying the more aggressive forms of sinusitis and their potential complications.

### Unilateral rhinorrhoea and button battery: a case report [^112SPnQd]. Family Medicine and Community Health (2019). Medium credibility.

On physical examination, clinicians should look meticulously for the presence of a foreign body, excessive unilateral nasal crusts and nasal mucosa ulceration. A cold spatula test can be easily performed to elicit unilateral nasal obstruction. A cold spatula is placed under the nostrils to compare the area of mist formation. The reduced or absence of mist formation from one nostril highly suggests of an embedded foreign body. An immediate referral for urgent intervention is of paramount particularly in a case of an embedded button battery.

X-ray of the paranasal sinus is highly recommended when in doubt. Button battery often displays a characteristic 'double ring' or 'halo' density, owing to the composition difference between its electrode plates and plastic grommet seal. A heterogeneous spectrum of sequela may result from an embedded button battery in the nasal cavity, varying from no complication to hazardous outcome such as septal perforation. The extent of injury is influenced by several factors such as the duration of mucosa exposure, the size, location, remaining voltage and chemical composition of the battery. Nasal mucosa injury ensues as early as 3 hours following an embedded button battery. The extent of injury is proportionate to the exposed time, with reported worsening of mucosa necrosis and septal perforation within 24 hours of exposure. Four proposed mechanisms accounted to mucosa injury include (1) pressure necrosis, (2) sodium hydrocyte leakage from the battery content, (3) electrical discharge, and (4) toxic heavy metal absorption. The risk of secondary infections involving the regional structures includes sinusitis, periorbital cellulitis, otitis media and meningitis. If left untreated, sepsis may progress and result in fatal toxic shock syndrome. Consequently, timely removal of the button battery followed with generous irrigation of the nasal cavity is thus vital in order to eradicate the precipitate.

In conclusion, button battery in the nasal cavity represents an otorhinolaryngology emergency for its conceivable catastrophic sequela. The clinical presentation of unilateral nasal discharge in children should never be taken lightly. Foreign body should always be kept in mind for the differential diagnosis of unilateral rhinorrhoea for all general practitioners. Vigilant clinical assessment must be carried out and referral to the otorhinolaryngologist should be made to prevent complication.

Our patient's home medications included insulin and lisinopril. Test results for rheumatoid factor, antinuclear antibody, antistreptococcal antibody, DNase B antibody, and cryoglobulin were normal. Complete blood count, serum and urine immunofixation, and colonoscopy were normal. Nasal septal perforation workup was negative for antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies measured by indirect immunofluorescence and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. Anticardiolipin, β2 glycoprotein, and lupus anticoagulant test results were normal. Evaluations for hepatitis A, B, and C infection were negative.

Chest radiography followed by computed tomography found right-sided multifocal pneumonitis and mild reactive lymphadenopathy. Bronchoalveolar lavage was negative for fungal, bacterial, Pneumocystis jiroveci, and mycobacterial organisms; no malignant cells were identified.

Urinalysis was negative for both protein and red blood cells, and renal function remained normal throughout follow-up. A urine toxicology screen was positive for cocaine, whereas results of serum levamisole testing performed 2 weeks later were negative.

Treatment with intralesional triamcinolone injection, local wound care, oral prednisone, dapsone, and topical tacrolimus was unsuccessful (Fig 6, A). A repeat urine toxicology screen confirmed continued use of cocaine at this time. Treatment of refractory PG was instituted with oral cyclosporine combined with oral prednisone and topical tacrolimus and cocaine discontinuation, resulting in gradual improvement (Fig 6, B). The nasal mucosal overgrowth rapidly responded as well (Fig 7). She successfully discontinued cyclosporine treatment without recurrence of skin or nasal PG lesions.

### Nasal vestibular furunculosis presenting as the rudolph sign [^114Cj3W9]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Nasal furunculosis is a deep infection of hair follicle within the nasal vestibule. In this report, the authors presented a 49-year-old woman with 4-day history of focal red area and tender swelling on the tip of her nose. On physical examination, together with a swelling at nasal vestibulum, erythema, and edema on the skin of nasal tip were observed, which is called the Rudolph Sign. The patient was treated with intranasal topical mupirocin and oral sodium fusidate. Because nasal furunculosis may lead to serious complications such as ophthalmic vein thrombosis and cavernous sinus thrombosis, early diagnosis and effective treatment is essential.

### Case studies in the surgical management of nasal airway obstruction [^1138F6qp]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Nasal obstruction is one of the most common complaints evaluated by the otolaryngologist. The differential diagnosis is broad, ranging from benign reversible causes to life-threatening diseases. In addition, patients may suffer from a combination of etiologies, further confusing the diagnosis. Surgical management is directed at the underlying origin of obstruction. The clinician therefore must use a careful history and physical examination as well as appropriate sinonasal imaging in accurately identifying the causes of nasal obstruction. To further illustrate these principles, we present two interesting cases of patients presenting with nasal obstruction.

### 'Saddle nose' deformity caused by advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the nasal septum [^114s7rbT]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

Hidden behind their common garden symptoms, malignant tumours of the nasal cavity are typically advanced when detected. Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is the most common histological type of these rare tumours which may simply present with epistaxis or a blocked nose. A 79-year-old woman attended our clinic with a 2-year history of progressive nasal collapse resulting in a 'saddle nose deformity'. Imaging showed a soft tissue mass with absolute destruction of the nasal septum and bones with hard palate and maxillary involvement. Histology confirmed a poorly differentiated SCC. Following discussion at the local head and neck multidisciplinary team meeting, the patient was offered radiotherapy alone due to her advanced presentation. She has had a good response to treatment with no further disease progression. Nasal septal SCC is far more successfully treated in the early stages. A suspicious clinician is the patients best ally.
