## Question

Is obtaining a procalcitonin useful if there's already an active infection?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether obtaining procalcitonin is useful when there is already an active infection. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "active infection" implies clinically and how that changes the role of procalcitonin. Then, I should verify the distinction between using procalcitonin to start antibiotics versus using it to stop or shorten antibiotics. Next, I will review the highest-quality evidence and guidelines for sepsis, respiratory infections, and hospital-acquired pneumonia. After that, I should consider special populations and limitations that could alter interpretation. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified recommendation with clear thresholds and monitoring advice, making sure I double-check any conflicting data before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame: if infection is already established, the diagnostic question "is this bacterial?" is largely behind us, so procalcitonin's principal value shifts from initiation to stewardship — specifically, whether we can safely reduce antibiotic exposure and how to time discontinuation, while avoiding premature stops in high-risk patients [^5bb292ba] [^2df94de1].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should verify the distinction between starting and stopping antibiotics. Guidelines consistently advise against using procalcitonin to decide when to start antibiotics in suspected sepsis because sensitivity is imperfect and delays can be harmful, whereas several guidelines support using procalcitonin to help decide when to stop antibiotics once therapy is underway and source control is adequate, given consistent signals for reduced exposure without excess harm [^9bd48716] [^5a5d94dc] [^5bb292ba].

> Next, I should review the highest-quality evidence for sepsis. The 2021 Surviving Sepsis Campaign issues a weak recommendation to use procalcitonin alongside clinical evaluation to guide discontinuation in adults with sepsis or septic shock when the optimal duration is unclear, citing 14 RCTs and a meta-analysis showing improved mortality and reduced antibiotic exposure; importantly, this applies after adequate source control and when procalcitonin is available [^5bb292ba] [^9709078f].

> I will now examine respiratory infections, where data are most robust. An individual patient data meta-analysis of 26 RCTs including 6,708 patients showed that procalcitonin-guided strategies reduced antibiotic exposure by a mean of 2.4 days and lowered 30-day mortality, with fewer antibiotic-related adverse effects; this supports using procalcitonin to guide both initiation in low-risk presentations and duration in higher-risk disease, integrated with clinical judgment [^957d0821] [^6643ccce].

> Wait, let me verify the CAP nuance. The ATS/IDSA 2019 CAP guideline recommends initiating empiric antibiotics regardless of initial procalcitonin in clinically suspected and radiographically confirmed CAP, because procalcitonin cannot reliably distinguish bacterial from viral pneumonia; however, procalcitonin remains useful to shorten therapy in CAP and in ambiguous presentations where bacterial disease is uncertain, which aligns with stewardship goals rather than diagnostic withholding [^2d1e9e45] [^b1b9ca48] [^95f6b452].

> Next, I should review hospital-acquired pneumonia. The IDSA/ATS HAP/VAP guideline suggests using procalcitonin plus clinical criteria to guide discontinuation, but recommends against using procalcitonin to decide whether to start antibiotics in suspected HAP/VAP due to high misclassification and lack of survival benefit; this reinforces a stewardship-focused role rather than a diagnostic gatekeeper role [^1b87fb0e] [^a1e2807a] [^7c97fe21].

> Let me consider special populations and limitations so I don't overgeneralize. In immunocompromised hosts, including patients with cancer or neutropenia, procalcitonin can be blunted or atypical, so I should be cautious and not rely on procalcitonin alone to stop therapy; similarly, in early localized infection, procalcitonin may be falsely low, and in severe trauma, surgery, or shock states, nonspecific elevations can occur, so serial kinetics and clinical correlation are essential [^00e71f71] [^21b9445c] [^64ca917b] [^c63eb767].

> I should double-check the practical thresholds and kinetics. Commonly used stopping rules include a decrease to less than 0.5 ng/mL or a reduction of at least 80% from peak, provided the patient is clinically improving; if procalcitonin remains high or rises despite therapy, I need to reassess for inadequate source control, resistant organisms, or alternative diagnoses before stopping antibiotics, which aligns with ICU and ED algorithms and meta-analytic data [^b7c8824d] [^2df94de1] [^957d0821].

> But wait, what if the infection is viral or mixed? I need to ensure I interpret procalcitonin in the right context. Low procalcitonin levels have a high negative predictive value for bacterial coinfection in influenza, supporting de-escalation when levels are low and clinical suspicion is modest; conversely, elevated levels support bacterial involvement and may justify continued or broader therapy pending cultures, again integrated with clinical judgment [^dc457e61].

> Let me synthesize a risk-stratified answer. Yes, obtaining procalcitonin is useful in active infection when the clinical question is stewardship — especially duration and safe discontinuation — rather than initial diagnosis. In sepsis, ICU patients with ongoing infection, and CAP where duration is uncertain, serial procalcitonin can reduce antibiotic exposure and, in sepsis, is associated with improved survival; however, in high-probability bacterial infections where antibiotics have already started, procalcitonin should not be used to withhold therapy, and decisions to stop must incorporate clinical trajectory and source control status [^5bb292ba] [^957d0821] [^2d1e9e45].

> Finally, I should confirm implementation details. Procalcitonin is most impactful when embedded in a protocol with predefined stopping rules, serial measurements rather than single values, and clinician override criteria for unstable patients; without such systems, misuse and nonadherence blunt benefits and increase costs, so institutional protocols and education are critical to realize the mortality and stewardship gains seen in trials and meta-analyses [^2df94de1] [^e57d9119] [^03dd4490].

In established infection, procalcitonin (PCT) is most useful for **guiding antibiotic discontinuation** [^5bb292ba] and monitoring treatment response, not for initial diagnosis [^9bd48716]. Serial PCT trends help identify when infection is resolving, enabling earlier, safe cessation of antibiotics and reducing exposure without increasing mortality or recurrence [^957d0821] [^6643ccce]. PCT is less reliable for initial diagnosis in active infection because levels can be elevated in noninfectious inflammation or blunted in early or localized disease [^64ca917b] [^c63eb767]. Use PCT alongside clinical assessment and repeat measurements to guide duration, especially in sepsis, pneumonia, or ICU settings [^2df94de1] [^5a5d94dc].

---

## Clinical utility of procalcitonin in established infection

### Monitoring treatment response

- **Serial PCT measurements** reflect infection control and can guide when to stop antibiotics [^178fdc83] [^2df94de1].
- **PCT kinetics** correlate with clinical improvement and can support earlier discontinuation of antibiotics [^e8b1cfe6] [^d2b3d113].
- **Reduced antibiotic exposure** is consistently observed with PCT-guided algorithms, without increased mortality or recurrence [^957d0821] [^6643ccce].

---

### Guiding antibiotic discontinuation

- **ICU sepsis**: PCT-guided discontinuation reduces antibiotic duration and may improve survival [^5bb292ba] [^788ddae4].
- **Respiratory infections**: PCT reduces antibiotic use and adverse effects without compromising outcomes [^957d0821] [^6643ccce].
- **HAP/VAP**: Guidelines suggest PCT plus clinical criteria to guide discontinuation, not initiation [^1b87fb0e] [^22a5fa57].

---

### Limitations and considerations

- **False positives**: PCT can rise with noninfectious inflammation (e.g. trauma, surgery, malignancy) [^64ca917b] [^c63eb767].
- **False negatives**: Early or localized infections may have low PCT [^64ca917b] [^c63eb767].
- **Clinical context**: Always interpret PCT with clinical assessment and repeat measurements [^2df94de1] [^178fdc83].

## Clinical scenarios where procalcitonin is useful in established infection

| **Clinical scenario** | **Role of pct** | **Evidence level** |
|-|-|-|
| Sepsis/septic shock | Guide discontinuation; reduce duration and mortality | High [^5bb292ba] [^788ddae4] |
| Community-acquired pneumonia | Shorten therapy; reduce adverse effects | High [^957d0821] [^6643ccce] |
| Hospital-acquired pneumonia | Guide discontinuation | Moderate [^1b87fb0e] [^22a5fa57] |
| ICU infections | Monitor response; guide duration | Moderate [^2df94de1] [^d7faabcf] |

---

## Clinical scenarios where procalcitonin may not be useful

- **Early infection**: Low PCT does not exclude bacterial disease [^64ca917b] [^c63eb767].
- **Localized infection**: PCT may be normal or mildly elevated [^64ca917b] [^c63eb767].
- **Noninfectious inflammation**: Elevations can mislead diagnosis [^64ca917b] [^c63eb767].

---

## Guidelines and expert consensus

- **Surviving sepsis campaign**: Use PCT to guide discontinuation in sepsis with adequate source control [^5bb292ba] [^9709078f].
- **ATS/IDSA**: Do not use PCT to decide when to start antibiotics in CAP [^2d1e9e45] [^b1b9ca48].
- **IDSA/ATS HAP/VAP**: Use PCT plus clinical criteria to guide discontinuation, not initiation [^1b87fb0e] [^22a5fa57].

---

## Practical approach to using procalcitonin in established infection

- **Baseline measurement**: Obtain at diagnosis to establish a reference [^notfound].
- **Serial measurements**: Trend every 2–3 days to assess response [^notfound].
- **Discontinuation rules**: Stop when PCT drops by ≥ 80% from peak or to < 0.5 ng/mL, with clinical improvement [^b7c8824d].
- **Override criteria**: Continue if clinical instability or inadequate source control [^b7c8824d].

---

Procalcitonin is most useful in established infection for **guiding antibiotic discontinuation** and monitoring response, reducing antibiotic exposure without harming outcomes [^957d0821] [^6643ccce]. It should be interpreted in clinical context, with serial measurements, and is not recommended for initial antibiotic decisions in sepsis or CAP [^9bd48716] [^2d1e9e45].

### Procalcitonin for diagnosis of infection and guide to antibiotic decisions: past, present and future [^7770c33f]. BMC Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

There are a number of limitations to using conventional diagnostic markers for patients with clinical suspicion of infection. As a consequence, unnecessary and prolonged exposure to antimicrobial agents adversely affect patient outcomes, while inappropriate antibiotic therapy increases antibiotic resistance. A growing body of evidence supports the use of procalcitonin (PCT) to improve diagnosis of bacterial infections and to guide antibiotic therapy. For patients with upper and lower respiratory tract infection, post-operative infections and for severe sepsis patients in the intensive care unit, randomized-controlled trials have shown a benefit of using PCT algorithms to guide decisions about initiation and/or discontinuation of antibiotic therapy. For some other types of infections, observational studies have shown promising first results, but further intervention studies are needed before use of PCT in clinical routine can be recommended. The aim of this review is to summarize the current evidence for PCT in different infections and clinical settings, and discuss the reliability of this marker when used with validated diagnostic algorithms.

Based on this evidence, PCT has been put forward as a promising candidate marker for diagnosis and for antibiotic stewardship in patients with systemic infections. Importantly, as with any diagnostic tool, PCT should be used embedded in clinical algorithms adapted to the type of infection and the clinical context and setting. While for some types of infections and clinical settings optimal PCT cut-offs have been established and their safety and efficacy shown in randomized-controlled intervention trials, for other types of infection only observational studies are available today (Figure 1), and thus the clinical benefit and safety of using PCT remains undefined.

Summary, future directions and conclusions

For upper and lower respiratory tract infection in ICU patients with sepsis and post-operative infections, randomized-controlled studies have shown the efficacy of using PCT algorithms to guide antibiotic decisions. For other types of infections, only observational studies are available which are importantly limited by the lack of a true gold standard. Most intervention studies were conducted in European countries including Switzerland, Germany, France and Denmark (and two in China) and validation in other countries and continents is therefore warranted. Importantly, PCT levels must always be evaluated in the context of a careful clinical and microbiological assessment. As the kinetics of PCT are of particular diagnostic and prognostic interest, repeated measurements should be performed if feasible, especially in persistently sick patients if antibiotics are withheld. The limitations of every PCT measurement include false-positive and false-negative results. Unspecific elevations of PCT levels in the absence of a bacterial infection can typically be seen in situations of massive cell death, for example after severe trauma or surgery. In these situations, PCT values are usually only moderately elevated and show a rapid decline in follow-up measurements. Conversely, falsely low PCT levels, typically seen during the early course or localized state of an infection, often show an increase in the follow-up measurements. Therefore, highly sensitive PCT assays are required, as subtle changes of PCT at very low concentrations can be monitored, increasing the sensitivity of the test and thus the safety of patients.

Emerging bacterial resistance to antimicrobial agents calls for more effective efforts to reduce the unnecessary and prolonged use of antibiotics in self-limiting non-bacterial and resolving diseases. Patients and physicians share a common goal of improving symptoms from infection as fast as possible and often see antibiotics as the most expeditious intervention to achieve it. This one-size fits-all approach fails to consider the basic questions of who benefits from antibiotic therapy, and if treated, what would be the optimal duration. Using PCT, which mirrors the likelihood of bacterial infection and the severity of infection, to guide antibiotic therapy, is a persuasive, evidence-based approach to a more rational use of antibiotics.

### Procalcitonin and other markers of infection. what should be their role in clinical practice? [^7720287d]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2002). Low credibility.

Clinicians are always faced with a decision when confronted with a febrile patient; they must decide between what is an infectious condition and what is not, and between what merits hospital observation, what requires empirical antibiotic treatment and what needs outpatient follow-up. In this respect, judgement based on medical history and physical examination outweigh the predictive value of various laboratory markers of infection, as the latter generally reflect a nonspecific reaction of the host to widely different infectious and inflammatory stimuli. In the evaluation of specific subgroups of patients, e.g. those in the intensive care unit, laboratory tests should also preferably form a continuum with medical history and physical examination, aimed at clarifying host condition, the setting and the source of a possible infection.

### Procalcitonin to guide antibiotic therapy in acute… [^2b73bc60]. AAFP (2018). Low credibility.

Clinical Question Can using procalcitonin levels help guide antibiotic stewardship for patients with acute respiratory infections. Evidence-Based Answer Procalcitonin-guided antibiotic therapy, when compared with routine treatments, results in decreased mortality in patients with acute respiratory infections. Compared with routine treatments, procalcitonin-guided antibiotic therapy also results in 2. 4 fewer overall days of exposure to antibiotics and fewer overall antibiotic-related adverse effects. 1 Practice Pointers Acute respiratory infections are the most common reason for antibiotic therapy in primary care and hospital settings.

2–4 Appropriate treatment, including judicious use of antibiotics, is associated with improved clinical outcomes. 3–5 Procalcitonin is a calcitonin precursor whose serum levels rise in the setting of bacterial infection; procalcitonin-guided antibiotic therapy is already used in many clinical settings. This Cochrane analysis was designed to evaluate whether procalcitonin-guided antibiotic therapy for acute respiratory infections leads to improved outcomes vs. routine management. It is an update of a 2012 review. Compared with patients receiving routine care, those receiving procalcitonin-guided antibiotic therapy for acute respiratory infections were found to have lower 30-day all-cause mortality across all clinical settings. Mortality is very low in primary care settings; therefore, assessment of this group was incomplete. P <. 001).

Procalcitonin can be used quickly, with most in-house laboratories returning results within two hours. However, it may be cost prohibitive depending on insurance. Appropriately timed and utilized procalcitonin-guided therapy has the potential to improve the management of patients with acute respiratory infections but has yet to be adequately studied in those with other clinical diagnoses. National guidelines do not yet mention the use of procalcitonin as part of the management of acute respiratory infections.

### Role of procalcitonin in managing adult patients with respiratory tract infections [^b3950817]. Chest (2012). Low credibility.

Respiratory infections remain the most common reason why patients seek medical care in ambulatory and hospital settings, and they are the most frequent precursor of sepsis. In light of the limitations of clinical signs and symptoms and traditional microbiologic diagnostics for respiratory infections, blood biomarkers that correlate with the presence and extent of bacterial infections may provide additional useful information to improve diagnostic and prognostic efforts and help with therapeutic decisions in individual patients. A growing body of evidence supports the use of procalcitonin (PCT) to differentiate bacterial from viral respiratory diagnoses, to help risk stratify patients, and to guide antibiotic therapy decisions about initial need for, and optimal duration of, therapy. Although still relatively new on the clinical frontier, a series of randomized controlled trials have evaluated PCT protocols for antibiotic-related decision making and have included patients from different clinical settings and with different severities of respiratory infection. In these trials, initial PCT levels were effective in guiding decisions about the initiation of antibiotic therapy in lower-acuity patients, and subsequent measurements were effective for guiding duration of therapy in higher-acuity patients, without apparent harmful effects. Recent European respiratory infection guidelines now also recognize this concept. As with any other laboratory test, PCT should not be used on a stand-alone basis. Rather, it must be integrated into clinical protocols, together with clinical, microbiologic data and with results from clinical risk scores. The aim of this review is to summarize recent evidence about the usefulness of PCT in patients with lower respiratory tract infections and to discuss the potential benefits and limitations of this marker when used for clinical decision making.

### How to: implement procalcitonin testing in my practice [^2df94de1]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Adding procalcitonin (PCT) to antibiotic stewardship algorithms may improve antibiotic use. However, PCT protocols need to be adapted to clinical settings and patient populations.

Objectives

To review PCT use in different medical settings and patient populations.

Sources

Most recent trials and meta-analyses investigating PCT for antibiotic stewardship were reviewed.

Content

Several trials found PCT-guided antibiotic stewardship to reduce antibiotic exposure and associated side-effects among patients with respiratory infection and sepsis. Decisions regarding antibiotic use in an individual patient are complex and should be based on the pre-test probability for bacterial infection, the severity of presentation and the results of PCT. In the context of a low pre-test probability for bacterial infections and a low-risk patient, a low PCT level helps to rule out bacterial infection and empiric antibiotic therapy can be avoided. In the context of a high pre-test probability for bacterial infections and/or a high-risk patient with sepsis, monitoring of PCT over time helps to track the resolution of infection and decisions regarding early stop of antibiotic treatment. Although these concepts have been successful in several respiratory infection and sepsis trials, some studies failed to show an added benefit of PCT due to factors such as low protocol adherence and relying on single rather than repeat PCT measurements.

Implication

As an adjunct to other clinical and laboratory parameters, PCT provides information about risk for bacterial infection and resolution of infection, and improves antibiotic stewardship decisions, thereby offering more individualized treatment courses with overall reduced antibiotic exposure.

### Procalcitonin: seeking a niche [^fedaf9bf]. Critical Care (2009). Low credibility.

For over a decade there has been intense interest given to the role of procalcitonin in the diagnosis and management of sepsis in critically ill patients. Early opinions strongly supported the diagnostic role but data accumulating from numerous subsequent studies are less supportive, even when used in very selective settings. Although there remains sufficient reason to support the use of procalcitonin in guiding antibiotic therapy or perhaps providing prognostic information, it may be time to focus our efforts on the early diagnosis of sepsis in the critically care setting on alternative, more promising methods.

### Procalcitonin to guide antibiotic decision making [^0b264f4e]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

There is convincing evidence linking antibiotic-stewardship efforts which include the infection marker procalcitonin (PCT) to more rational use of antibiotics with improvements in side-effects and clinical outcomes. This is particularly true in the setting of respiratory infection and sepsis. Yet, some recent trials have shown no benefit of PCT-guided care. Our aim was to discuss the benefits and limitations of using PCT for early infection recognition, severity assessment and therapeutic decisions in individual patients based on most the recent study data.

Recent Findings

Current evidence from randomized trials, and meta-analyses of these trials, indicates that PCT-guided antibiotic stewardship results in a reduction in antibiotic use and antibiotic side-effects, which translates into improved survival of patients with respiratory infections and sepsis. Notably, initial PCT levels have been found to be helpful in defining the risk for bacterial infection in the context of a low pretest probability for bacterial infections (i.e., patients with bronchitis or chronic bastructive pulmonary disease exacerbation). Monitoring of repeated PCT measurements over time has also been found helpful for estimating recovery from bacterial infection and prognosis in higher risk situations (i.e., pneumonia or sepsis) and results in early and safe discontinuation of antibiotic therapy. Some trials, however, did not find a strong effect of PCT guidance which may be explained by low protocol adherence, assessment using only a single rather than repeat PCT levels and lower antibiotic exposure in control group patients. Using PCT in the right patient population, with high-sensitivity assays and with adequate training of physicians is important to increase protocol adherence and reduce antibiotic exposure.

Summary

Inclusion of PCT into antibiotic stewardship algorithms has the potential to improve the diagnostic and therapeutic management of patients presenting with respiratory illnesses and sepsis, and holds great promise to mitigate the global bacterial resistance crisis and move from a default position of standardized care to more personalized treatment decisions.

### How to use biomarkers of infection or sepsis at the bedside: guide to clinicians [^178fdc83]. Intensive Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Sepsis is defined as a life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. In this context, biomarkers could be considered as indicators of either infection or dysregulated host response or response to treatment and/or aid clinicians to prognosticate patient risk. More than 250 biomarkers have been identified and evaluated over the last few decades, but no biomarker accurately differentiates between sepsis and sepsis-like syndrome. Published data support the use of biomarkers for pathogen identification, clinical diagnosis, and optimization of antibiotic treatment. In this narrative review, we highlight how clinicians could improve the use of pathogen-specific and of the most used host-response biomarkers, procalcitonin and C-reactive protein, to improve the clinical care of patients with sepsis. Biomarker kinetics are more useful than single values in predicting sepsis, when making the diagnosis and assessing the response to antibiotic therapy. Finally, integrated biomarker-guided algorithms may hold promise to improve both the diagnosis and prognosis of sepsis. Herein, we provide current data on the clinical utility of pathogen-specific and host-response biomarkers, offer guidance on how to optimize their use, and propose the needs for future research.

### Utility of procalcitonin as a biomarker for sepsis in children [^1df78c2c]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Sepsis is a complex process defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. It is associated with significant morbidity and mortality rates in both adults and children, and emphasis has been placed on its early recognition and prompt provision of antimicrobials. Owing to limitations of current diagnostic tests (i.e., poor sensitivity and delayed results), significant research has been conducted to identify sepsis biomarkers. Ideally, a biomarker could reliably and rapidly distinguish bacterial infection from other, noninfectious causes of systemic inflammatory illness. In doing so, a sepsis biomarker could be used for earlier identification of sepsis, risk stratification/prognostication, and/or guidance of antibiotic decision-making. In this minireview, we review one of the most common clinically used sepsis biomarkers, procalcitonin, and its roles in sepsis management in these three areas. We highlight key findings in the adult literature but focus the bulk of this review on pediatric sepsis. The challenges and limitations of procalcitonin measurement in sepsis are also discussed.

### Procalcitonin testing to guide antibiotic therapy in acute upper and lower respiratory tract infections [^6643ccce]. JAMA (2018). Excellent credibility.

Clinical Question

Is the use of procalcitonin for guiding antibiotic decisions in patients with acute upper and lower respiratory tract infections associated with improved clinical outcomes compared with usual care?

Bottom Line

Among patients with varying types and severity of acute respiratory infection, using procalcitonin to guide decisions about antibiotics is associated with lower rates of antibiotic exposure, antibiotic-related adverse effects, and mortality.

### Procalcitonin to guide duration of antibiotic therapy in intensive care patients: a randomized prospective controlled trial [^73193561]. Critical Care (2009). Low credibility.

Key messages

- PCT is the first laboratory marker among a large array of inflammatory variables that offers the possibility to differentiate bacterial infection from viral or non-infectious inflammatory reaction.

- PCT assessment provides a helpful tool to decide on the duration of antibiotic treatment, if interpreted in the clinical context including the underlying disease.

- PCT-based algorithm supports the cautious use of antibiotics and has a favourable effect on the clinical outcome.

- PCT-based algorithm is certainly practicable and simple.

- PCT-controlled antibiotic therapy must still be tested in heterogenous groups of patients, particularly for safety.

### Duration of antibiotic treatment using procalcitonin-guided treatment algorithms in older patients: a patient-level meta-analysis from randomized controlled trials [^28ed5dc0]. Age and Ageing (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Sepsis remains a major healthcare problem worldwide and is responsible for a large number of deaths particularly in the older patient population. Early identification and appropriate initial management, including start of antibiotic treatment and fluid resuscitation, have been shown to improve outcomes. In addition, monitoring of patients during treatment both for timely escalation of therapy in case of treatment failure and de-escalation in case of a favourable treatment response has an important impact on patients' recovery. This also includes early de-escalation or cessation of antibiotic treatment once a patient's condition has stabilized, with signs indicating progression towards resolution of infection. In addition to closely monitoring the clinical status of patients, blood biomarkers mirroring specific physiopathological pathways may help to better estimate the resolution of infection thereby improving clinical decision-making. Serum procalcitonin (PCT) has emerged as a host-derived biomarker that provides prognostic information in patients with infections and thus may improve sepsis management. Particularly, the kinetics of PCT in an infected patient provide information about the recovery and risk for adverse outcome, which in turn may influence decisions about the duration of antibiotic treatment. Multiple randomized controlled trials (RCT) have investigated the benefits of using serum PCT levels to guide whether and for how long antibiotic therapy is used — a process referred to as PCT-guided antibiotic stewardship — in patients with different types of infections including sepsis patients in intensive care unit (ICU). There are several trials and meta-analyses from such trials suggesting that PCT use decreases antibiotic exposure with beneficial effects on clinical outcomes including lower mortality in patients with respiratory tract infections, sepsis and blood stream infection.

### Procalcitonin-guided antibiotic therapy may shorten length of treatment and may improve survival-a systematic review and meta-analysis [^8405edab]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Implications for practice and research

The rapid application of scientific results is of utmost importance. Our results suggest that PCT-guided AB management could reduce the length of AB therapy in ICU patients, especially in countries and institutes where routine AB administration exceeds 7 days.

The current sepsis guideline recommends against the use of PCT and clinical evaluation to decide when to start AB therapy in septic patients. However, we believe that further research is needed in this field, especially to evaluate PCT kinetics (i.e. changes in 12–24 h) compared to protocols based on a fix value (i.e. 0.5 ng/mL as cut off). Furthermore, the increased rate of recurrent infections, the difference between medical and surgical patients and finally testing whether a liberal or a conservative regime is more beneficial should also deserve further investigations. We also suggest that in future trials, "organ support free days" should be used as the primary outcome rather than mortality, which is affected by a number of confounding factors during the full course of a critical illness; therefore it may not necessarily reflect the efficacy of a particular intervention. Finally, we need data on immunocompromised patients who may also benefit from this approach.

### Procalcitonin is useful for evaluating patients with ambiguous presentation and for early discontinuation of antibiotics in community-acquired pneumonia [^95f6b452]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

To the Editor:

The updated American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) conclude that procalcitonin (PCT) is not recommended to determine the need for initial antibacterial therapy in patients with clinically suspected and radiographically confirmed CAP. It seems rational that in a patient with a high pretest probability for pneumonia, any biomarker (including PCT) that is not 100% accurate should not have a strong influence on treatment decisions. The advantage of using PCT for the management of patients with CAP, however, has been demonstrated for patients in whom a CAP diagnosis is unclear (e.g. patients with no infiltrate in chest X-ray) and for monitoring patients with CAP to decide whether to stop treatment early. Most trials that evaluated PCT for the management of CAP did not rely on the initial PCT level and instead focused on the kinetics of this blood marker to indicate that antibiotic treatment should be stopped early. The initial PCT level was found to be helpful in patients with a bronchitis-like illness and possible CAP but an ambiguous clinical presentation. A recent meta-analysis of individual patient data that focused specifically on patients with respiratory infection and CAP who had participated in randomized trials showed that PCT is highly effective in reducing the duration of antibiotic treatment. Specifically, the analysis included 6,708 patients from 26 eligible trials in 12 countries and found a 2.4-day reduction in antibiotic exposure (5.7 vs. 8.1 d [95% confidence interval (CI), –2.71 to –2.15]; P < 0.0001) and a reduction in antibiotic-related side effects (16% vs. 22%, adjusted odds ratio, 0.68 [95% CI, 0.57 to 0.82]; P < 0.0001). Importantly, when PCT was used to guide discontinuation of treatment, patients had significantly improved clinical outcomes (odds ratio for mortality, 0.83 [95% CI, 0.70–0.99]; P = 0.037).

### Use of plasma procalcitonin levels as an adjunct to clinical microbiology [^b3425cbc]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2010). Low credibility.

Procalcitonin (PCT) is synthesized by a large number of tissues and organs in response to invasion by pathogenic bacteria, fungi, and some parasites. Current PCT assays are rapid, specific, and of sufficient sensitivity to detect increases in PCT serum levels within 4 to 6 h of initiation of infection. Clinically, PCT levels may help in decisions regarding the need for empirical antibiotic therapy, "source control" of infection, and duration of antibiotic therapy. The addition of PCT levels to bacterial culture and viral detection results can assist with the separation of colonization and invasion by pathogenic bacteria.

### What procalcitonin brings to management of sepsis in the ICU [^fe2f3eb5]. Critical Care (2010). Low credibility.

In inflammatory states, particularly in response to infectious stimuli, local procalcitonin (PCT) production rises, and because these tissues cannot further process PCT into calcitonin, serum levels increase. In the critical care setting, PCT should be considered a useful tool to help physicians in some specific, although frequent, situations. Serial measurements of PCT levels may indicate the effectiveness of medical decisions such as the appropriateness of antibiotic therapy, the detection of new infections, and the exclusion of a diagnosis of sepsis. PCT-guided algorithms may also help to decrease the duration of antimicrobial therapy. However, the role of PCT as a prognostic marker in critically ill patients is controversial. In a study by Karlsson and colleagues, PCT concentrations did not differ between hospital survivors and nonsurvivors, but the outcome was better in patients whose PCT concentrations decreased more than 50%. The study of PCT kinetics thus could offer an individual risk assessment in patients with severe sepsis.

### Procalcitonin as a biomarker in respiratory tract infection [^76303c00]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Serum procalcitonin (PCT) levels rapidly increase in patients with invasive bacterial disease. PCT levels increase faster than do C-reactive protein levels. Furthermore, a rapid decrease in the PCT level is supporting evidence that the source of the bacterial infection is responding to clinical management. In patients with community-acquired bacterial pneumonia, sequential PCT levels are useful as a guide to shorter courses of antimicrobial therapy. With use of emerging multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction platforms for the detection of viral and bacterial respiratory pathogens, it should be possible to critically assess whether an elevated serum PCT level is a valid biomarker of invasive bacterial infection.

### Do we need new trials of procalcitonin-guided antibiotic therapy? [^c7a53ac0]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Using biomarkers as a guide to tailor the duration of antibiotic treatment in respiratory infections is an attractive hypothesis assessed in several studies. Recent work aiming to summarize the evidence assessed the effect of a procalcitonin (PCT)-guided antibiotic treatment on outcomes in acute lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI), suggesting that significant reductions in antibiotic duration occur when using a PCT-guided algorithm. However, controversial evidence also suggested PCT-guided algorithms were associated with increased antibiotic duration and increased incidence of Clostridium difficile, without any impact on mortality, in real-world settings. So, although using PCT-guided antibiotic stewardship is promising, after more than a decade of randomized controlled trials on this topic the evidence in its favor is still less than compelling due to limitations in trial design, not taking into consideration fundamental aspects of PCT biology, and the absence of evidence-based antimicrobial duration in intervention and control groups. In this commentary we highlight some questions and limitations of primary PCT study data that might impact interpretation and clinical use of PCT at the bedside.

### Procalcitonin-guided diagnosis and antibiotic stewardship revisited [^589ab4de]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Several controlled clinical studies have evaluated the potential of the infection biomarker procalcitonin (PCT) to improve the diagnostic work-up of patients with bacterial infections and its influence on decisions regarding antibiotic therapy. Most research has focused on lower respiratory tract infections and critically ill sepsis patients. A clinical utility for PCT has also been found for patients with urinary tract infections, postoperative infections, meningitis, and patients with acute heart failure with possible superinfection (i.e., pneumonia). In these indications, PCT levels measured on hospital admission were found to substantially reduce the initiation of antibiotic treatment in low-risk situations (i.e., bronchitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation). For more severe infections (i.e., pneumonia, sepsis), antibiotic stewardship by monitoring of PCT kinetics resulted in shorter antibiotic treatment durations with early cessation of therapy. Importantly, these strategies appear to be safe without increasing the risk for mortality, recurrent infections, or treatment failures. PCT kinetics also proved to have prognostic value correlating with disease severity (i.e., pancreatitis, abdominal infection) and resolution of illness (i.e., sepsis). Although promising findings have been published in these different types of infections, there are a number of limitations regarding PCT, including suboptimal sensitivity and/or specificity, which makes a careful interpretation of PCT in the clinical context mandatory. This narrative review aims to update clinicians on the strengths and limitations of PCT for patient management, focusing on research conducted within the last 4 years.

### Biomarkers in sepsis: can they help improve patient outcome? [^e8b1cfe6]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Biomarkers, mainly procalcitonin, are commonly used in sepsis diagnosis, prognosis and treatment follow-up. This review summarizes the potential benefit of their use for the critically ill.

Recent Findings

Increased clinical evidence from randomized clinical trials of biomarker-guided treatment suggests a trend for appropriate but short antimicrobial treatment for the critically ill. Procalcitonin (PCT) is the most studied biomarker; in the majority of randomized clinical trials, the use of a stopping rule of antibiotics on the day when PCT is below 80% from baseline or less than 0.5ng/ml was proven effective to reduce length of antimicrobial treatment, antibiotic-associated adverse events and infectious complications like infections by multidrug-resistant organisms and Clostridium difficile. Survival benefit was also noted.

Summary

Biomarkers, mainly PCT, may help improve sepsis outcome by restriction of injudicious antimicrobial use.

### Using procalcitonin to guide antimicrobial duration in sepsis: asking the same questions will not bring different answers [^1cedab81]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Severe sepsis is a major healthcare problem and the early initiation of antimicrobials is one of the few measures associated with improved outcomes. However, antibiotic overuse is an increasing problem in critical care. Of several potential biomarkers for antibiotic stewardship, procalcitonin represents the most widely studied and validated. In this commentary we address the current literature on the use of biomarkers to guide antimicrobial therapy in the critically ill and discuss its limitations and future directions.

### Procalcitonin for diagnosis of infection and guide to antibiotic decisions: past, present and future [^64ca917b]. BMC Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Limitations and areas of uncertainty

Sepsis is not a well-defined disease, but a consequence of different infectious disease entities and far too complex to be reduced to a single cut-off of any surrogate marker. Limitations of every PCT measurement include false-positive and false-negative results. Different pathogens might induce distinct responses resulting in a variable up-regulation of circulating PCT levels. While highly elevated PCT levels were found in patients with pneumococcal CAP, the same was not true in CAP due to atypical organisms such as mycoplasma. Antimicrobial pre-treatment may influence the level of PCT resulting in lower PCT levels, although it remains unclear whether this relates to a direct effect or rather to lower microbial burden in patients treated with antibiotics. Unspecific elevations of PCT levels in the absence of a bacterial infection can typically be seen in situations of massive stress, for example after severe trauma and surgery or in patients after cardiac shock. Although the available evidence from intervention studies favors the use of PCT for de-escalation of antibiotic therapy, the same may not be true for escalation of antibiotics when PCT increases as recently demonstrated. In this study PCT-guided escalation of diagnostic procedures and antibiotic therapy in the ICU did not improve survival and led to worse secondary outcomes in patients.

### Effect of procalcitonin-guided antibiotic treatment on clinical outcomes in intensive care unit patients with infection and sepsis patients: a patient-level meta-analysis of randomized trials [^05cd8f72]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Sepsis, defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection, remains a major healthcare problem worldwide and affects millions of people each year. Early identification and appropriate initial management including the start of antibiotic treatment and fluid resuscitation improves outcomes. In addition, monitoring of patients during treatment both for timely escalation of therapy in case of treatment failure and de-escalation in case of a favorable treatment response has an important impact on patient recovery. This also includes early de-escalation or cessation of antibiotic treatment once a patient's condition has stabilized, with signs indicating progression towards the resolution of infection.

Given that clinical signs for monitoring patients with sepsis can be ambiguous, the use of additional biomarkers mirroring specific physiopathological pathways has been proposed. In this context, serum procalcitonin (PCT) has emerged as a sensitive biomarker that provides prognostic information in patients with infections, and thus may improve sepsis management. Multiple studies have demonstrated that PCT levels increase in response to bacterial infection and decrease during recovery. Reflecting the host response to a bacterial infection, PCT thus provides important adjunctive information in addition to traditional clinical and diagnostic parameters.

Multiple trials have investigated the benefits of using serum PCT levels to guide whether and for how long antibiotic therapy is used — a process referred to as PCT-guided antibiotic stewardship — in patients with infection in the intensive care unit (ICU). While most trials have focused on the effects of PCT guidance on antibiotic usage, a recent large trial from the Netherlands reported lower mortality following PCT-guided therapy. However, conclusive evidence on the safety of this approach across different types of infection and sepsis severities has been limited due to largely insufficient statistical power in most of the individual trials. Moreover, meta-analyses focusing on the impact of PCT-guided antibiotic stewardship in sepsis patients on clinical outcomes overall and within patient subgroups based on infection type and severity have been inconclusive. A noteworthy limitation of these meta-analyses was that they were based on aggregate data, limiting opportunities to harmonize outcome definitions among trials and to investigate the impact of PCT guidance in different patient subgroups.

To address this significant drawback of earlier meta-analyses, we performed a meta-analysis of individual patient data from 11 randomized-controlled trials (RCTs) to assess the safety of using PCT to guide antibiotic decisions in ICU patients with infection and different sepsis severities and with the involvement of different organs.

### Do we need new trials of procalcitonin-guided antibiotic therapy? [^00e71f71]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Are PCT limitations addressed?

In addition, another important limitation of PCT use is related to the lack of information on specific conditions and populations where its value is inadequate because of intrinsic constraints. In critically ill patients the presence of acute kidney injury or the use of renal replacement therapies has a profound effect on PCT concentrations. Additionally, PCT tends to be less responsive to repeated inflammatory insults (such as VAP or nosocomial bloodstream infections), resulting in lower than expected peak concentrations. Similar findings are described in neutropenic patients, limiting the interpretation and use of PCT in this context.

### Procalcitonin-guided diagnosis and antibiotic stewardship revisited [^833e734e]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Summary, future directions, and conclusions

This update of a previous narrative review found several interesting new clinical settings in which PCT-guided therapy could help to reduce antibiotic exposure by decreasing either initiation or duration of treatment. Particularly, controlled clinical studies have found that PCT improves the management of patients with lower respiratory tract infections and critically ill sepsis patients, as well as patients with UTIs, postoperative infections, meningitis, and acute heart failure with possible superinfection (i.e. pneumonia). Recording PCT levels on hospital admission was found to substantially reduce the initiation of antibiotic treatment in low-risk situations (i.e. bronchitis, AECOPD). For more severe infections (i.e. pneumonia, sepsis), antibiotic stewardship by monitoring PCT kinetics resulted in shorter antibiotic treatment duration by early cessation of therapy. These strategies appear to be safe without increasing the risk for mortality, recurrent infections, or treatment failure. PCT kinetics have also proved to have prognostic value, correlating with disease severity (i.e. pancreatitis, abdominal infection) and resolution of illness (i.e. sepsis). While there is strong evidence regarding antibiotic stewardship in respiratory infection and sepsis, PCT has not been as well studied for other types of infections. Thus, future research should focus on non-respiratory infections and investigate whether PCT improves antibiotic decisions in these patients. PCT should also be compared to other markers, such as CRP, in regard to diagnostic accuracy and cost-effectiveness.

Emerging bacterial resistance to antimicrobial agents calls for more effective efforts to reduce the unnecessary and prolonged use of antibiotics in self-limiting non-bacterial and resolving diseases. Healthcare professionals share a common goal of achieving symptom relief from infection as fast as possible and often see antibiotics as the best means to achieve this goal. This "one size fits all" approach, however, does not answer the basic questions of who truly benefits from antibiotic therapy and what would be the optimal duration of treatment. There is a growing body of literature supporting the use of PCT as a persuasive, evidence-based approach to a more rational use of antibiotics.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign: international guidelines for management of sepsis and septic shock 2021 [^5bb292ba]. Intensive Care Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Procalcitonin-guided discontinuation of antimicrobials — evidence and recommendation: In patients with sepsis, direct evidence from 14 randomized controlled trials (n = 4,499 patients) assessed procalcitonin to guide treatment duration and a meta-analysis showed improved mortality with procalcitonin versus control (RR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.80 to 0.99) with no effect on length of stay; antibiotic exposure was consistently lower with procalcitonin, although in many trials the total duration was still 7 days or longer, algorithms and thresholds varied, and the overall quality of evidence was judged low; undesirable effects were considered minimal, cost data are limited with one single-center study reporting decreased hospital costs with PCT-guided antibiotic, and testing may not be available in all settings, including LMICs; based on apparent benefit and no obvious undesirable effects, we suggest using procalcitonin along with clinical evaluation to decide when to discontinue antimicrobials in adults with an initial diagnosis of sepsis or septic shock and adequate source control, if the optimal duration of therapy is unclear and if procalcitonin is available.

### GRADE-based procalcitonin guideline for emergency departments [^384b236b]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Procalcitonin is a useful biomarker for infection. Over the past two decades, there has been much research on the clinical applications of procalcitonin, yet the majority of these studies have been conducted in the intensive care setting. Despite the extensive use of procalcitonin in emergency departments, there have been no guidelines focusing specifically on these clinical settings. Additionally, previous guidelines were predominantly shaped by expert consensus and rarely incorporate evidence-based medicine concepts. To address these shortcomings, the current guideline adopts a novel approach. Initially, we identified the most critical questions regarding the use of procalcitonin in emergency settings through expert voting. This was followed by a systematic literature review and the evaluation of evidence levels using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) methodology. Key characteristics of individual studies will be summarized and evaluated by the guideline development group to determine the overall quality of evidence. The GRADE working group's categorization system will be employed to rate evidence quality into four levels. Recommendations will be formulated based on explicit consideration of established criteria. This structured approach ensures that guideline recommendations are founded on robust evidence and transparently assessed for strength and potential caveats. This is the first guideline on the use of procalcitonin to be applied in emergency departments that adopts the principles of evidence-based medicine and encompasses the up-to-date literatures, and it marks an advancement in providing guidance on the utilization of procalcitonin in emergency departments.

### How to use… procalcitonin [^3ed6f0e8]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2018). Low credibility.

Diagnosing bacterial infection in the unwell or febrile child is a common challenge faced by all paediatricians. Despite the advent of novel molecular techniques, there is ongoing need for diagnostic assays with adequate performance and turnaround time to facilitate safe clinical decision-making when bacterial sepsis is suspected, such as whether to commence empirical treatment with antibiotics. Procalcitonin is an established marker of infection that has a potential role in the diagnosis and exclusion of serious or invasive bacterial infection in neonates and children. Although enthusiastically adopted in many countries and institutions, national guidance in the UK does not yet support its routine use. This article reviews the relevant literature on the use of procalcitonin measurement in common paediatric clinical scenarios.

### When once is not enough – further evidence of procalcitonin-guided antibiotic stewardship [^3547d322]. Critical Care (2009). Low credibility.

Every day, critical care physicians around the world face the same challenge of the optimal timing of antimicrobial administration: when to start and when to stop antibiotics. Duration of antibiotic therapy for sepsis is mostly based on expert opinion, but its reduction is arguably the most promising approach to decrease emergence and selection of antibiotic resistance. The study by Hochreiter and colleagues presents another piece of evidence suggesting that procalcitonin may indeed be a valuable diagnostic parameter to guide antibiotic treatment duration, despite the ongoing controversy about the diagnostic accuracy of pro-calcitonin.

### Procalcitonin to guide initiation and duration of antibiotic treatment in acute respiratory infections: an individual patient data meta-analysis [^df6460ea]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Similar to other tests, the use of PCT cut-offs and test result interpretation need to be reflected in the context of the pretest probability and to be adapted to clinical settings and the risk of patients. In included trials with patients at low risk for severe bacterial infections (eg, primary-care patients), a PCT algorithm was used to determine whether antibiotics should be initiated at all; in trials with higher-risk patients (ICU or ED patients), PCT was mainly used to determine when treatment could be safely discontinued. Importantly, all trials included PCT in clinical algorithms, and physicians could deviate from the PCT algorithm if needed. As a consequence, some trials had low protocol adherence, particularly ICU trials. Although reductions in antibiotic exposure despite this low adherence were impressive, concerns about safety may arise. Clinicians commonly agree that important clinical decisions, such as initiation and continuation of antibiotic therapy, should not be based on a single diagnostic criterion only; PCT should complement but not replace clinical decision making. Accordingly, PCT protocols specified "overruling criteria" whereby the PCT algorithm could be bypassed (eg, if clinical criteria suggest a high-risk situation). Of note, sensitivity analyses showed no evidence of heterogeneity, and results were similar when only trials with high adherence rates were considered. Poststudy surveys have been published in order to better understand the effects and challenges of PCT protocols in clinical practice, where adherence and confidence will be a crucial factor for the success of this strategy.

### Procalcitonin-guided diagnosis and antibiotic stewardship revisited [^0d6ebb7d]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

There are important limitations to consider when using conventional diagnostic markers, such as blood cultures and inflammatory markers (i.e. C-reactive protein [CRP]), for patients with a clinical suspicion of infection, particularly in regard to suboptimal sensitivity and specificity. These limitations often leave physicians with ambiguity regarding the necessity of the use of antibiotic treatment. As a consequence, unnecessary and prolonged exposure to antimicrobial agents adversely affect patient outcomes (e.g. risk for Clostridium difficile infection), while inappropriate antibiotic therapy increases antibiotic resistance in patients, resulting in a public health threat. A growing body of evidence supports the use of the infection marker procalcitonin (PCT) to improve the diagnosis of bacterial infections and to indicate resolution of infection, thereby helping to monitor patients and guide antibiotic therapy.

Based on a review published in 2011, this current narrative review aims to update clinicians on (promising) new indications for PCT in patient management by focusing on research studies published from 2012 to the end of 2016. The evidence from observational and interventional research is ordered by different types of infections and study designs. Proposed PCT cut-offs and the main conclusions of relevant studies are summarized in Table 1 and graphically displayed in Fig. 1.

### Procalcitonin is useful for evaluating patients with ambiguous presentation and for early discontinuation of antibiotics in community-acquired pneumonia [^e29498bd]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Thus, there is strong clinical evidence that PCT is useful for evaluating patients with lower respiratory infection and ambiguous presentation and for stopping antibiotics early in patients with confirmed CAP. It is unfortunate that the updated guideline focused on a clinical situation in which no biomarker would be expected to have a strong influence on treatment (i.e. patients with clinically suspected and radiographically confirmed CAP) and unfortunate that it did not include recommendations for using PCT in ambiguous clinical situations and for guiding treatment duration, both of which have a strong impact on antibiotic overuse and associated health risks.

Procalcitonin as a guide for antibiotic decisions: results from randomized-controlled studies

The clinical implications of the above mentioned observational studies may be limited by differences in disease definitions and patient groups, use of insensitive (semi-quantitative) PCT assays, and different methodological issues such as observer bias, selection bias and issues of sample availability, co-infection and colonization. To overcome these limitations, several randomized-controlled studies have investigated the use of PCT to assist in decisions about initiation and/or duration of antibiotic therapy (antibiotic stewardship). Thereby the benefit of PCT was measured by clinical outcomes, assuming that if the patient recovers without antibiotics, there was no relevant bacterial illness in need of antibiotic therapy. Importantly, all intervention studies used fully automated highly sensitive PCT assays, the results of which can be obtained in the clinical routine of an emergency department within one hour thus permitting bed-side decision making. Recently, different options for PCT testing have become available, including the KRYPTOR, the VIDAS system (Biomerieux), the Liaison BRAHMS PCT (DiaSorin) and the Elecsys BRAHMS PCT (Roche Diagnostics).

All published studies on antibiotic stewardship used similar clinical algorithms with recommendations for or against antibiotic treatment based on PCT cut-off ranges. For moderate risk patients with respiratory tract infections in the emergency department (Figure 2), algorithms recommended initiation and discontinuation of antibiotic therapy based on four different cut-off ranges. Initial antibiotics were withheld mostly in patients with low risk for systemic infection with acute bronchitis or exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [ECOPD]). Clinical re-evaluation and a repeated measurement of PCT were recommended after 6 to 24 hours if the clinical condition did not improve spontaneously. If PCT values were increased and antibiotic therapy was initiated, repeated PCT measurements were recommended every one to two days, depending on the clinical severity of disease, and antibiotics were discontinued using the same cut off ranges or a marked drop by 80% to 90% if initial levels were high (for example > 5 μg/l). To assure safety, specific criteria were predefined where this algorithm could be overruled, such as life-threatening disease or immediate need for ICU admission. For high risk patients in the ICU setting (Figure 3), algorithms focused on discontinuation of antibiotic therapy if a patient showed a clinical recovery and PCT levels decreased to 'normal' levels, or by at least 80% to 90%.

### Effect of procalcitonin-guided antibiotic treatment on clinical outcomes in intensive care unit patients with infection and sepsis patients: a patient-level meta-analysis of randomized trials [^788ddae4]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The clinical utility of serum procalcitonin levels in guiding antibiotic treatment decisions in patients with sepsis remains unclear. This patient-level meta-analysis based on 11 randomized trials investigates the impact of procalcitonin-guided antibiotic therapy on mortality in intensive care unit (ICU) patients with infection, both overall and stratified according to sepsis definition, severity, and type of infection.

Methods

For this meta-analysis focusing on procalcitonin-guided antibiotic management in critically ill patients with sepsis of any type, in February 2018 we updated the database of a previous individual patient data meta-analysis which was limited to patients with respiratory infections only. We used individual patient data from 11 trials that randomly assigned patients to receive antibiotics based on procalcitonin levels (the "procalcitonin-guided" group) or the current standard of care (the "controls"). The primary endpoint was mortality within 30 days. Secondary endpoints were duration of antibiotic treatment and length of stay.

Results

Mortality in the 2252 procalcitonin-guided patients was significantly lower compared with the 2230 control group patients (21.1% vs 23.7%; adjusted odds ratio 0.89, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.8 to 0.99; p = 0.03). These effects on mortality persisted in a subgroup of patients meeting the sepsis 3 definition and based on the severity of sepsis (assessed on the basis of the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, occurrence of septic shock or renal failure, and need for vasopressor or ventilatory support) and on the type of infection (respiratory, urinary tract, abdominal, skin, or central nervous system), with interaction for each analysis being > 0.05. Procalcitonin guidance also facilitated earlier discontinuation of antibiotics, with a reduction in treatment duration (9.3 vs 10.4 days; adjusted coefficient −1.19 days, 95% CI −1.73 to −0.66; p < 0.001).

Conclusion

Procalcitonin-guided antibiotic treatment in ICU patients with infection and sepsis patients results in improved survival and lower antibiotic treatment duration.

### Prognostic value of procalcitonin in respiratory tract infections across clinical settings [^d08e83c5]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusions

This is the first large-scale study in which the prognostic value of admission PCT levels has been investigated throughout all clinical settings in the field of ARIs. PCT levels mainly provide prognostic information for risk stratification of patients in the ED setting and in patients with low to moderate ARIs. Future randomised controlled studies must address whether adding PCT to initial risk assessment can improve patient management and prognostication.

### Procalcitonin for diagnosis of infection and guide to antibiotic decisions: past, present and future [^75836442]. BMC Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Arguably, the most important (over-) use of antibiotics occurs in primary care. As many as 75% of patients with upper and lower respiratory infections receive antibiotics, despite the mostly viral origin of the condition. Two multicenter primary care trials, powered for non-inferiority of clinical outcomes, investigated the safety and feasibility of PCT guided algorithms in patients with upper and lower respiratory infections, essentially relying on an initial PCT measurement only. Both trials found substantial reductions in antibiotic exposure (by 75% and 42%), and similar clinical outcomes, particularly a similar time to recovery.

In more high risk patients in the ICU setting, different trials have investigated the use of PCT, mainly for discontinuation of antibiotics. The first small proof of concept study found a four-day reduction in the duration of antibiotic therapy in patients with severe sepsis, but only in the per protocol analysis. A subsequent large multicenter trial in France recently validated this concept in more than 600 patients. PCT guided patients had similar 30-day mortality rates and similar rates of relapses, but markedly more antibiotic-free days alive (14.3 versus 11.6). Another multinational ICU study focused on ventilator-associated pneumonia and found that PCT guidance resulted in a higher number of antibiotic free-days alive (13 versus 9.5 days). Two German studies assessed the effect of PCT guidance in surgical ICU patients with suspected bacterial infections in the post-operative course. PCT guidance resulted in a significant reduction of antibiotic therapy and similar medical outcomes. In addition, the length of intensive care treatment in the PCT-guided group was significantly shorter than that in the control group (15.5 versus 17.7 days), a finding similar to the first ICU study. Importantly, the use of PCT for discontinuation of antibiotics in ICU patients is still limited by a relatively small number of patients included in previous trials and awaits further large-scale validation. There are currently different ongoing trials focusing on this vulnerable patient population that should shed further light on the benefits and harms of PCT use in ICU patients.

### Procalcitonin for diagnosis of infection and guide to antibiotic decisions: past, present and future [^40f480f1]. BMC Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Emerging bacterial resistance to antimicrobial therapeutics calls for more stringent efforts to reduce antibiotic overuse. Towards this aim, there has been considerable interest in antibiotic stewardship programs aimed at reducing antibiotic overuse by tailoring antibiotic therapy to individual needs of patients. Despite the successful implementation of diagnostic biomarkers in different fields of medicine (for example, D-dimers in pulmonary embolism, natriuretic peptides in acute heart failure, troponin in myocardial infarction), accurate and timely diagnosis of bacterial infections remains a challenge. Reliable clinical and/or microbiological parameters from easy to obtain specimens that may be used to diagnose bacterial infections and rule out other infections not in need of antibiotic therapy have been largely lacking. The main disadvantages of many current microbiological methods are diagnostic delays (for example, culture methods), suboptimal sensitivity (for example, blood cultures) and low specificity due to contamination (for example, sputum cultures), whereas others are not amenable to routine diagnostics due to their invasive nature (for example, lung biopsy). Inflammatory markers, such as C-reactive protein (CRP) or white blood cells (WBC), lack specificity for bacterial infections. This is partly explained by the heterogeneity of different infections and the complex interaction of different pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators of the host response aimed at combating invading pathogens during systemic infections, which depend on timing, type, extent and site of the underlying infection.

In this diagnostic dilemma, procalcitonin (PCT) has stimulated great interest as a potentially more specific marker for bacterial infection. PCT is produced ubiquitously in response to endotoxin or mediators released in response to bacterial infections (that is, interleukin (IL)-1β, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, and IL-6) and strongly correlates with extent and severity of bacterial infections. Because up-regulation of PCT is attenuated by interferon (INF)-γ, a cytokine released in response to viral infections, PCT is more specific for bacterial infections and may help to distinguish bacterial infections from viral illnesses. PCT shows a favorable kinetic profile for use as a clinical marker: it promptly increases within 6 to 12 hours upon stimulation and circulating PCT levels halve daily when the infection is controlled by the host immune system or antibiotic therapy. PCT correlates with bacterial load and severity of infection. PCT thus has prognostic implications and the course of PCT predicts fatal outcome in patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and critically ill patients with sepsis.

### Procalcitonin-guided diagnosis and antibiotic stewardship revisited [^d2b3d113]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Sepsis, severe sepsis, and septic shock

Sepsis, as defined by SIRS criteria and organ dysfunction, and septic shock are common diseases in the ICU and require fast and appropriate antimicrobial therapy. Multiple studies have investigated whether a PCT-guided algorithm can optimize the therapeutic approach in these patients, mainly by monitoring PCT kinetics and stopping antibiotics once PCT has dropped to levels < 0.5 ng/ml or by at least 80–90% of the peak in combination with clinical improvement. A 2013 meta-analysis including 1075 patients with sepsis or septic shock found overall reduced antibiotic treatment courses (6 days versus 8 days) when PCT was used to guide therapy compared to routine care. There was no increase in 28-day or in-hospital mortality or in length of stay in the ICU or the hospital. The authors do stress that there was heterogeneity in PCT protocols across trials with regard to different cut-off values or different algorithms for medical or surgical patients. A large RCT published in 2016 in the Netherlands evaluated the use of PCT to de-escalate and stop antibiotics in 1575 critically ill patients who had received antibiotics < 24 h before inclusion in the study for an assumed or proven infection. The study found that the PCT-guided protocol shortened length of antibiotic treatment (5 days versus 7 days in the first 28 days of admission) and lowered 28-day mortality from 25 to 19.6%. Although the cause of the reduced mortality remained unclear, a lower risk of antibiotic-associated side effects and improved therapeutic monitoring could have been factors. Very similar results in a recently published RCT from Germany also found a lower antibiotic consumption using PCT, but no benefit in mortality.

Procalcitonin as a diagnostic marker: results from observational studies

A plethora of observational studies have investigated the diagnostic potential of PCT in different clinical situations and different types and sites of infections. Table 1 summarizes study designs, proposed PCT cut-offs and main conclusions of selected relevant studies investigating different types of infections. This selection focuses on more recent research and on studies using highly sensitive PCT assays (that is, with a functional assay sensitivity around 0.06 μg/L).

Abbreviations: COPD, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; ED, Emergency department; PCT, procalcitonin; RCT, randomized-controlled trial. The level of evidence in favor or against PCT for each infection was rated by two of the coauthors (PS, WCA) independently and disagreements were resolved by consensus.

+ moderate evidence in favor of PCT; ++ good evidence in favor of PCT; +++ strong evidence in favor of PCT;? evidence in favor or against the use of PCT still undefined

For the diagnosis of blood stream infections and bacteremia, studies found a high diagnostic performance of PCT. To distinguish blood contamination from true blood stream infection in patients with growth of coagulase-negative staphylococci in their blood cultures, PCT demonstrated a better discriminatory ability compared to WBC and CRP. At a cut-off of 0.1 ug/L, PCT had a very high sensitivity to exclude true infection. Two other studies, focused on the use of PCT to predict bacteremia infections in patients with CAP and urinary tract infections (UTI). A PCT cut off of 0.25 ug/L was most helpful to exclude bacteremic disease with a high negative predictive value in both settings.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign: international guidelines for management of sepsis and septic shock 2021 [^9bd48716]. Critical Care Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Biomarkers to start antibiotics — procalcitonin: For adults with suspected sepsis or septic shock, we suggest against using procalcitonin plus clinical evaluation to decide when to start antimicrobials, as compared to clinical evaluation alone (weak recommendation, very low quality of evidence). In a meta-analysis of 30 studies (3,244 patients), procalcitonin had a pooled sensitivity of 77% and specificity of 79% for sepsis in critically ill patients, but a meta-analysis of three RCTs (n = 1,769 ICU patients) comparing procalcitonin-guided initiation vs usual care found no difference in short-term mortality (RR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.86 to 1.15), length of ICU stays (MD, 0.19 days; 95% CI, -0.98 to 1.36), or length of hospitalization (MD, 7.00 days; 95% CI, -26.24 to 12.24), and long-term mortality, readmission rates, and hospital-free days were not reported in any of the trials.

### Role of procalcitonin in the management of infected patients in the intensive care unit [^6b16c44c]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

The combination of molecular pathogen diagnostics and the biomarker procalcitonin (PCT) are changing the use of antimicrobials in patients admitted to critical care units with severe community-acquired pneumonia, possible septic shock, or other clinical syndromes. An elevated serum PCT level is good supportive evidence of a bacterial pneumonia, whereas a low serum PCT level virtually eliminates an etiologic role for bacteria even if the culture for a potential bacterial pathogen is positive. Serum PCT levels can be increased in any shocklike state; a low PCT level eliminates invasive bacterial infection as an etiology in more than 90% of patients.

### Uses of procalcitonin as a biomarker in critical care medicine [^a978bd3b]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Procalcitonin is a commonly used biomarker for infection and severity in the intensive care unit. Although relatively specific for bacterial, as opposed to viral, infections, serum procalcitonin levels also correlate with disease severity and thus cannot reliably distinguish between bacterial and nonbacterial infections in the setting of critical illness, particularly in cases of severe influenza and coronavirus disease-2019. Baseline procalcitonin levels are insufficiently discriminative to permit the withholding of antibiotics in patients with critical illness and suspected sepsis. Trends in procalcitonin levels over time, however, give us the opportunity to individualize the duration of antibiotics without negative impacts on mortality.

### Procalcitonin [^93be22fe]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2015). Low credibility.

Procalcitonin (PCT) is the 116 amino acid precursor of the hormone calcitonin, produced by the C cells of the thyroid. Its synthesis is upregulated in bacterial infection and downregulated by viral infection. Consequently, with the increasing development of antibiotic resistance, interest has focused on the ability of this marker to not only diagnose infection but to tailor antibiotic treatment and help reduce the development of antibiotic resistance. The value of PCT depends on the specific clinical situation and pretest probability of disease. This article discusses the role of PCT in these different situations, namely primary care, the emergency department and the intensive care unit. The true cost effectiveness of this test remains difficult to prove as evidence for the potential impact of using PCT on slowing the development of bacterial resistance remains largely circumstantial.

### Efficacy and safety of procalcitonin guidance in reducing the duration of antibiotic treatment in critically ill patients: a randomised, controlled, open-label trial [^1847d899]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Background

In critically ill patients, antibiotic therapy is of great importance but long duration of treatment is associated with the development of antimicrobial resistance. Procalcitonin is a marker used to guide antibacterial therapy and reduce its duration, but data about safety of this reduction are scarce. We assessed the efficacy and safety of procalcitonin-guided antibiotic treatment in patients in intensive care units (ICUs) in a health-care system with a comparatively low use of antibiotics.

Methods

We did a prospective, multicentre, randomised, controlled, open-label intervention trial in 15 hospitals in the Netherlands. Critically ill patients aged at least 18 years, admitted to the ICU, and who received their first dose of antibiotics no longer than 24 h before inclusion in the study for an assumed or proven infection were eligible to participate. Patients who received antibiotics for presumed infection were randomly assigned (1:1), using a computer-generated list, and stratified (according to treatment centre, whether infection was acquired before or during ICU stay, and dependent on severity of infection [ie, sepsis, severe sepsis, or septic shock]) to receive either procalcitonin-guided or standard-of-care antibiotic discontinuation. Both patients and investigators were aware of group assignment. In the procalcitonin-guided group, a non-binding advice to discontinue antibiotics was provided if procalcitonin concentration had decreased by 80% or more of its peak value or to 0.5 μg/L or lower. In the standard-of-care group, patients were treated according to local antibiotic protocols. Primary endpoints were antibiotic daily defined doses and duration of antibiotic treatment. All analyses were done by intention to treat. Mortality analyses were completed for all patients (intention to treat) and for patients in whom antibiotics were stopped while being on the ICU (per-protocol analysis). Safety endpoints were reinstitution of antibiotics and recurrent inflammation measured by C-reactive protein concentrations and they were measured in the population adhering to the stopping rules (per-protocol analysis). The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01139489, and was completed in August, 2014.

Findings

Between Sept 18, 2009, and July 1, 2013, 1575 of the 4507 patients assessed for eligibility were randomly assigned to the procalcitonin-guided group (761) or to standard-of-care (785). In 538 patients (71%) in the procalcitonin-guided group antibiotics were discontinued in the ICU. Median consumption of antibiotics was 7.5 daily defined doses (IQR 4.0–12.7) in the procalcitonin-guided group versus 9.3 daily defined doses (5.0–16.6) in the standard-of-care group (between-group absolute difference 2.69, 95% CI 1.26–4.12, p < 0.0001). Median duration of treatment was 5 days (3–9) in the procalcitonin-guided group and 7 days (4–11) in the standard-of-care group (between-group absolute difference 1.22, 0.65–1.78, p < 0.0001). Mortality at 28 days was 149 (20%) of 761 patients in the procalcitonin-guided group and 196 (25%) of 785 patients in the standard-of-care group (between-group absolute difference 5.4%, 95% CI 1.2–9.5, p = 0.0122) according to the intention-to-treat analysis, and 107 (20%) of 538 patients in the procalcitonin-guided group versus 121 (27%) of 457 patients in the standard-of-care group (between-group absolute difference 6.6%, 1.3–11.9, p = 0.0154) in the per-protocol analysis. 1-year mortality in the per-protocol analysis was 191 (36%) of 538 patients in the procalcitonin-guided and 196 (43%) of 457 patients in the standard-of-care groups (between-group absolute difference 7.4, 1.3–13.8, p = 0.0188).

Interpretation

Procalcitonin guidance stimulates reduction of duration of treatment and daily defined doses in critically ill patients with a presumed bacterial infection. This reduction was associated with a significant decrease in mortality. Procalcitonin concentrations might help physicians in deciding whether or not the presumed infection is truly bacterial, leading to more adequate diagnosis and treatment, the cornerstones of antibiotic stewardship.

### Biomarkers of sepsis and bloodstream infections: the role of procalcitonin and proadrenomedullin with emphasis in patients with cancer [^21b9445c]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Sepsis and bloodstream infections remain a leading cause of death in immunocompromised patients with cancer. The management of these serious infections consist of empiric use of antimicrobial agents which are often overused. Procalcitonin and proadrenomedullin are biomarkers that have been extensively evaluated in the general populations but with little emphasis in the population immunocompromised patients with cancer, where they may have promising roles in the management of febrile patients. In this review, we summarize the available evidence of the potential role of these available biomarkers in guiding antimicrobial therapy to optimize the use of resources in the general patient population. Special emphasis is given to the role of these 2 biomarkers in the immunocompromised and critically ill patients with cancer, highlighting the distinctive utility of each.

### Procalcitonin-guided therapy in intensive care unit patients with severe sepsis and septic shock – a systematic review and meta-analysis [^3098bba5]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Key messages

- A PCT-guided treatment reduces the duration of antimicrobial therapy in severe sepsis patients, without increasing 28-day and in-hospital mortality rates

- Recommendations for PCT-guided treatment algorithms for treatment of severe sepsis patients differ substantially among published studies

- Future studies have to show which PCT-guided treatment algorithms could be recommended in severe sepsis patients

### Procalcitonin-guided antibiotic therapy may shorten length of treatment and may improve survival-a systematic review and meta-analysis [^78e21e1c]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

PCT-guided AB therapy may be associated with reduced AB use, lower 28-day mortality but higher infection recurrence, with similar ICU and hospital length of stay. Our results render the need for better designed studies investigating the role of PCT-guided AB stewardship in critically ill patients.

### Procalcitonin-guided therapy in intensive care unit patients with severe sepsis and septic shock – a systematic review and meta-analysis [^2339da98]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusion

An approach along a biomarker-guided treatment algorithm using procalcitonin levels may be helpful to guide antimicrobial treatment in severe sepsis patients, treated in ICUs and reduces the duration of antimicrobial therapy without an obvious increase in mortality. However, more research is urgently needed to investigate the safety and effectiveness in subgroups of surgical and medical severe sepsis patients, treated in ICUs. Most importantly, treatment algorithms differ substantially and have to be clarified in future studies.

### Procalcitonin to guide duration of antibiotic therapy in intensive care patients: a randomized prospective controlled trial [^1b19235c]. Critical Care (2009). Low credibility.

Discussion

Despite being considered as surrogate signs of systemic inflammation, SIRS criteria are not always the result of a systemic infection. They may arise due to general impairment of the human organism. Standard laboratory variables such as CRP have a slow kinetic profile rendering it an inappropriate marker for a fast evaluation of the dynamics of an infection. The same applies for the leukocyte count. Furthermore, IL-6 levels are not indicators of infections or sepsis, although they correlate well with the degree of severity of inflammation.

Sepsis continues to be the leading cause of morbidity and in its severe form (severe sepsis, septic shock, and multi-organ dysfunction) of mortality in intensive care patients. Treatment is generally most effective if it is initiated without delay according to current recommendations and guidelines. Therefore, a fast and accurate diagnosis of infection and sepsis is of central importance.

### Monitoring treatment response in abdominal sepsis with procalcitonin – if only! [^ffd3f498]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

The ideal management of infection includes not only the early identification and start of effective therapy but also the correct categorization of non-infected patients in order to avoid unnecessary use of antimicrobials. The availability of a specific and sensitive test for the presence of infection is of paramount importance to improve the prudent use of antimicrobial therapy. Procalcitonin (PCT) has been evaluated over recent years as to whether it can be used to detect the presence of different types of infection, allows reduced duration of antibiotic therapy, or predicts treatment failure or adverse outcome. In the previous issue of Critical Care, Jung and colleagues report about the monitoring of treatment response in abdominal sepsis by repetitive determination of PCT.

### Biomarkers improve diagnostics of sepsis in adult patients with suspected organ dysfunction based on the quick sepsis-related organ failure assessment (qSOFA) score in the emergency department [^d377380d]. Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

KEY POINTS

Question: Can the combined use of biomarkers and clinical scores in the emergency department (ED) improve the early identification of patients at risk for sepsis?

Findings: Biomarkers of infection and organ dysfunction, most notably procalcitonin, substantially improved early prediction of sepsis over and above quick Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) alone.

Meanings: A combination of qSOFA and procalcitonin provides a simple screening tool to improve prediction of sepsis on ED admission. This may potentially impact upon patient management though this needs to be tested in prospective studies.

Sepsis is a potential life-threatening complication of an infectious disease. Development of acute organ dysfunction as a result of an inappropriate host response to the underlying infection is the hallmark of this syndrome. This remains the most frequent driver of death on ICUs worldwide. While infection is, in general, a commonplace and frequently self-limiting event, progression to organ dysfunction is relatively rare. As such, a broad range of patients with suspected or proven infection, most of which are benign, present to the emergency department (ED). Delayed identification of patients with overt or incipient organ dysfunction is a well-documented problem in the ED and may have a significant impact on morbidity and mortality.

In this context, biomarkers providing objective and measurable indicators of sepsis could offer considerable utility for diagnostic, prognostic, and theranostic enrichment. This is particularly relevant in view of the large numbers of patients presenting with fever or other nonspecific signs of infection to the ED, as well as those with a noninfectious mimic that can simulate sepsis. Many articles have addressed various biomarkers reflecting the host response in sepsis, early recognition of organ dysfunction, risk stratification, and patient management including biomarker-guided antibiotic stewardship. However, clear recommendations regarding use of biomarkers in guidelines such as the "Surviving Sepsis Campaign" are scarce. Only the incorporation of plasma lactate levels to diagnose septic shock and the use of procalcitonin to terminate anti-infective therapy in the context of antibiotic stewardship are supported by an evidence base and subsequent guideline recommendations. This paucity reflects the absence of adequately powered studies to assess any potential patient-centered benefit through measuring biomarkers, such as diagnosing sepsis in unselected patients presenting to an ED.

### Effectiveness and safety of procalcitonin evaluation for reducing mortality in adults with sepsis, severe sepsis or septic shock [^63509d5c]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Serum procalcitonin (PCT) evaluation has been proposed for early diagnosis and accurate staging and to guide decisions regarding patients with sepsis, severe sepsis and septic shock, with possible reduction in mortality.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness and safety of serum PCT evaluation for reducing mortality and duration of antimicrobial therapy in adults with sepsis, severe sepsis or septic shock.

Search Methods

We searched the Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2015, Issue 7); MEDLINE (1950 to July 2015); Embase (Ovid SP, 1980 to July 2015); Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS via BIREME, 1982 to July 2015); and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL; EBSCO host, 1982 to July 2015), and trial registers (ISRCTN registry, ClinicalTrials.gov and CenterWatch, to July 2015). We reran the search in October 2016. We added three studies of interest to a list of 'Studies awaiting classification' and will incorporate these into formal review findings during the review update.

Selection Criteria

We included only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) testing PCT-guided decisions in at least one of the comparison arms for adults (≥ 18 years old) with sepsis, severe sepsis or septic shock, according to international definitions and irrespective of the setting.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors extracted study data and assessed the methodological quality of included studies. We conducted meta-analysis with random-effects models for the following primary outcomes: mortality and time spent receiving antimicrobial therapy in hospital and in the intensive care unit (ICU), as well as time spent on mechanical ventilation and change in antimicrobial regimen from a broad to a narrower spectrum.

Main Results

We included 10 trials with 1215 participants. Low-quality evidence showed no significant differences in mortality at longest follow-up (risk ratio (RR) 0.81, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.65 to 1.01; I² = 10%; 10 trials; N = 1156), at 28 days (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.31; I² = 0%; four trials; N = 316), at ICU discharge (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.50 to 2.11; I² = 49%; three trials; N = 506) and at hospital discharge (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.27; I² = 0%; seven trials; N = 805; moderate-quality evidence). However, mean time receiving antimicrobial therapy in the intervention groups was -1.28 days (95% CI to -1.95 to -0.61; I² = 86%; four trials; N = 313; very low-quality evidence). No primary study has analysed the change in antimicrobial regimen from a broad to a narrower spectrum.

Authors' Conclusions

Up-to-date evidence of very low to moderate quality, with insufficient sample power per outcome, does not clearly support the use of procalcitonin-guided antimicrobial therapy to minimize mortality, mechanical ventilation, clinical severity, reinfection or duration of antimicrobial therapy of patients with septic conditions.

### Reassessing procalcitonin-guided antibiotic therapy in critically ill patients with sepsis: lessons from the ADAPT-sepsis trial [^8c325c54]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Randomized trials of procalcitonin-guided algorithms to discontinue antibiotics in critically ill patients with sepsis report reduced antibiotic duration and possible mortality benefit. However, open-label trial designs, inconsistent algorithm adherence, and unclear stewardship practices have limited confidence in procalcitonin's benefit. The ADAPT-Sepsis trial addressed several of these gaps through a concealed intervention, robust stewardship, and head-to-head comparison with CRP. Procalcitonin-guided care reduced antibiotic use without significantly impacting mortality, while CRP-guided care showed no benefit. However, algorithm adherence was suboptimal and the absolute reduction in antibiotic duration with procalcitonin was only one day. As shorter fixed-duration therapy becomes standard, procalcitonin's utility in the ICU may decline. Embedding procalcitonin and other biomarkers into multifaceted stewardship strategies, and addressing barriers to clinician trust and implementation, is essential. Future research should also evaluate whether biomarker use earlier in the sepsis care pathway, particularly in Emergency Departments, can improve early diagnostic accuracy and enhance patient outcomes.

### Don't perform procalcitonin testing without an established, evidence-based protocol… [^e57d9119]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

Procalcitonin is a biomarker that has been used successfully to identify patients with certain bacterial infections. The appropriate use includes serial measurements of procalcitonin in select patient populations. Such uses may help to identify low-risk patients with respiratory infections who would not benefit from antibiotic therapy, and to differentiate blood culture contaminants from true infections. When used appropriately, there are significant opportunities to decrease unnecessary antimicrobial use. The overuse of antimicrobial agents is directly related to the increasing antimicrobial resistance, so judicious use of these agents is warranted. Unfortunately, procalcitonin is often either misused or established algorithms are not followed.

When the latter occurs, the procalcitonin result becomes simply another piece of laboratory data that adds costs, but does not benefit the patient. These scenarios often occur because there is not an evidence-based utilization plan established at an institution. Laboratory and intensive care unit leadership are encouraged to identify the major users of procalcitonin, to establish guidelines that are most appropriate for the local setting and to monitor use.

### Prognostic value of procalcitonin in respiratory tract infections across clinical settings [^29f1f7e7]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

The assessment of disease severity and prediction of adverse outcome in patients with acute respiratory tract infections (ARIs) is essential to improve patient management, including therapeutic and diagnostic steps and site-of-care decisions [1–3]. For this purpose, different blood biomarkers have been evaluated to predict mortality in smaller patient cohorts and critically ill patients, but results are still somewhat controversial in regard to type of biomarker for specific ARI subpopulation and optimal cutoff levels for clinical routine [4–10].

Procalcitonin (PCT), a precursor protein of calcitonin, is currently one of the most frequently used infectious disease biomarkers in clinical practice. PCT levels mirror severity and evolution of infection and are thought to be associated with poor prognosis in patients with sepsis and ARI. Changes in PCT level in response to therapeutic treatment have also been reported, which suggests prognostic significance in a variety of clinical settings. However, there is a lack of clinical data comparing PCT in different clinical settings (primary care, emergency department (ED), intensive care unit (ICU)) and across ARI diagnoses to aid in better understanding its (prognostic) value in daily clinical practice.

In the present study, we investigated the prognostic value of admission PCT levels to predict treatment failure and mortality alone in a large ARI patient population across different settings, ARI diagnoses and countries by performing an individual patient data meta-analysis.

### Effect of procalcitonin-guided antibiotic treatment on clinical outcomes in intensive care unit patients with infection and sepsis patients: a patient-level meta-analysis of randomized trials [^825e23d2]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

This meta-analysis of individual patient data from 11 randomized trials that included 4482 patients with infection treated in ICUs revealed lower mortality associated with PCT-guided therapy, confirming the results of a large Dutch trial. This effect was consistent in sepsis patients based on the sepsis 3 definition, and across different severities and types of sepsis based on whether PCT-guided treatment was employed, and also across different types of infection. Moreover, PCT guidance was also associated with a modest reduction in exposure to antibiotics through shorter treatment durations and earlier discontinuation. However, PCT guidance did not have an effect on length of ICU or hospital stay.

Early diagnosis combined with initiation of appropriate antibiotic treatment remains the cornerstone of sepsis care. Once treatment is initiated, close monitoring of patients is of the utmost importance to identify patients with a favorable disease course who are at low risk for complications so that one may consider early cessation of antibiotic therapy. Daily assessment of patient risk using objective prognostic parameters is therefore important. In addition to clinical parameters, blood markers may aid in patient monitoring. While serum lactate is a commonly used biomarker that may help guide resuscitation measures, PCT has been previously demonstrated to be helpful in assessing the response to antimicrobial treatment and in aiding antibiotic stewardship decisions. Based on multiple randomized trials integrated in an aggregate patient data meta-analysis, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has recently approved the PCT assay for the purpose of guiding antibiotic therapy in the context of sepsis. However, since sepsis is not a well-defined disease but a heterogenous syndrome arising from different possible organs being infected and with different clinical presentations based on severity, the question of safety and efficacy of PCT guidance in patients with sepsis overall, and in subgroups based on severity and organs involved, is relevant. In this context, our finding that lower mortality and shorter antibiotic courses are associated with PCT-guided care is reassuring.

### Serial procalcitonin predicts mortality in severe sepsis patients: results from the multicenter procalcitonin MOnitoring SEpsis (MOSES) study [^2c0949dd]. Critical Care Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Implications of Findings

Early recognition and the start of appropriate antibiotic treatment, fluid resuscitation, source control, and close patient monitoring remain the cornerstone of care to lower sepsis related morbidity and mortality. In real-life practice, this remains challenging because clinical variables lack specificity for sepsis etiology and prognosis. Additionally, microbiologic diagnostics have low sensitivity and modalities such as cultures do not provide needed information in a timely fashion. Therefore, sepsis biomarkers are promising tools to help monitor patient response to therapy and may help guide therapeutic decisions in individual patients. It is particularly challenging during initial patient evaluation to determine which patients with sepsis will not respond well to therapeutic measures, and thus will have worsening of their clinical status. Specifically, the development of new or worsening organ dysfunction portends poor outcome and is a common pathway to death in these patients. Novel strategies that improve a clinician's ability to accurately risk stratify patients with suspected sepsis facilitate early and appropriate therapeutic intervention, improve important triage decisions (e.g. admission to the hospital vs discharge home, or admission to ICU vs non-ICU bed, or continuation of care in the ICU vs discharge to the hospital ward), and provide a means to follow response to therapy, including antibiotic stewardship. PCT has generated much interest as a sepsis biomarker that is associated with increased risk and severity of bacterial infection. PCT has also been found to correlate with risk of culture-proven bacteremia. Although the biological function of PCT in host defense is incompletely understood, this peptide influences the immune system in various ways including a decrease in phagocytic and candidacidal activity of neutrophils and also leads to an increase in the concentration of intracellular calcium ions which facilitate the host response.

### Serum procalcitonin measurement as diagnostic and prognostic marker in febrile adult patients presenting to the emergency department [^237a3cfe]. Critical Care (2007). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Within the context of febrile adult patients presenting to an ED, PCT assay at a 0.2 μg/l threshold can help physicians to identify bacterial/parasitic infections. Whether this can back up therapeutic decisions must be investigated in interventional studies. PCT measurement in the emergency room could contribute to the early identification of critical illness. Emergency febrile patients with PCT above 5 μg/l should be carefully monitored to identify severe sepsis or septic shock criteria.

### Procalcitonin-guided diagnosis and antibiotic stewardship revisited [^c63eb767]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Limitations

This narrative review has limitations. First, we did not do a systematic review for each type of infection but have selected studies based on a PubMed search and the authors' expertise. Our conclusions may thus be too enthusiastic. Second, most of the studies did not blind patients and/or investigators and thus are subject to possible bias. Third, we focused on studies published between 2012 and mid-2016. Papers before or after this time frame may have been missed. We have also not discussed in detail other markers of infection such as CRP. However, there is a lack of well-done and large studies comparing the effect of both markers when used in the context of antibiotic stewardship.

Importantly, PCT is far from being a perfect marker and levels must be evaluated in the context of a careful clinical and microbiological patient assessment. Because the kinetics of PCT are of particular diagnostic and prognostic importance, repeated measurements should be performed. This is particularly true for persistently sick patients and in situations in which antibiotics are withheld. The limitations of PCT include false-positive and false-negative results. PCT levels can increase in the absence of a bacterial infection in patients with severe trauma or after surgery. Here, PCT usually shows a rapid decline in follow-up measurements when the patient recovers. Also, patients with chronic renal failure can have a slower decrease in PCT levels. PCT levels can also be low in the early course or localised state of an infection, with later measurements showing an increase in levels. Again, repeated PCT measurements are advised in case of uncertainty. Another important consideration is the cost of measuring PCT. While some reviews found PCT to be cost-efficient in respiratory infections when antibiotics can be reduced by the measurement of this marker, this may not be true for other indications.

### Cost-effectiveness of procalcitonin testing to guide antibiotic treatment duration in critically ill patients: results from a randomised controlled multicentre trial in the Netherlands [^33c5a01b]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Procalcitonin (PCT) is a biomarker that can be used in addition to traditional markers (i.e. C-reactive protein (CRP)) for diagnosing and monitoring patients with bacterial infections. Findings from several randomised controlled trials (RCTs) indicate that the use of a PCT-guided antibiotic treatment algorithm (i.e. PCT guidance) is likely to contribute to a reduction of antibiotic exposure in septic patients in the intensive care unit (ICU), without an adverse effect on health outcomes. In addition, a recently published Cochrane review concluded that the use of PCT-guided initiation and duration of antibiotic treatment results in a decreased mortality risk, lower antibiotic consumption, and (consequently) a lower risk of antibiotic-related side effects in patients with acute respiratory tract infections. Yet, the considerable cost of PCT testing compared to other laboratory assays (i.e. CRP) remains an important barrier to broader implementation. This barrier may (partly) result from limited insight into the consequences of this PCT algorithm, as both costs and health outcomes that occur along the diagnostic and treatment pathways have not been analysed in depth. Importantly, previous modelling studies into PCT guidance have suggested that it has the potential to save costs. However, those studies were all based on a hypothetical patient population instead of real-life patient outcome data, and proved to strongly depend upon the input parameters used. In addition, as results from cost-effectiveness studies may not be readily transferable between countries, it is uncertain to what extent the results from those previous studies can be applied to the Netherlands. In particular, as antibiotic prescription and the duration of hospitalization are relatively low in the Netherlands compared to other developed countries, this will limit the potential impact of PCT guidance.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign: international guidelines for management of sepsis and septic shock 2021 [^9709078f]. Critical Care Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Sepsis and septic shock — procalcitonin-guided discontinuation of antimicrobials is supported by evidence from 14 randomized controlled trials (RCTs; n = 4,499 patients) assessing use of procalcitonin to guide duration, with a meta-analysis reporting improved mortality (RR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.80 to 0.99) and no effect on length of stay in ICU or hospital; antibiotic exposure was consistently lower though in many trials the total duration of therapy was still 7 days or longer, and the overall quality of evidence was judged to be low. Based on apparent benefit and no obvious undesirable effects, we suggest using procalcitonin along with clinical evaluation to decide when to discontinue antimicrobials in adults with an initial diagnosis of sepsis or septic shock and adequate source control, if the optimal duration of therapy is unclear and if procalcitonin is available.

### Procalcitonin-guided antibiotic therapy may shorten length of treatment and may improve survival-a systematic review and meta-analysis [^56eb3a68]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Length of ICU stay, length of hospital stay, healthcare costs

Higher infection recurrence rate did not result in excessive ICU and in-hospital stay in the PCT group, which is consistent with the previous meta-analysis in septic ICU patients. Despite the high heterogeneity in cost-effectiveness reports, our results suggest that PCT guidance at least does not appear to be inferior to SOC, but further research is needed to draw firm conclusions about this outcome.

### Procalcitonin to guide duration of antibiotic therapy in intensive care patients: a randomized prospective controlled trial [^075aa617]. Critical Care (2009). Low credibility.

Beyond a reduction of the length of antibiotic treatment PCT guidance also had a favorable effect on the length of the intensive care stay. These findings are in accordance with a recent publication by Nobre and colleagues who observed a reduction of the length of antibiotic therapy along with a two-day shorter average duration of intensive care treatment using a PCT-based algorithm.

As already mentioned before, delayed diagnosis and inadequate antibiotic therapy have unfavorable consequences for the success of treatment in patients with sepsis. On the other hand, if antibiotic treatment is inadequate and too long the development of antibiotic resistance is favoured. The duration of antibiotic therapy is based on the type of infection, suspected or proven pathogens, and the clinical course with potential recurrence of clinical signs and symptoms of infection. The length of treatment should be kept as short as possible.

### Neglected variables in the interpretation of serum procalcitonin levels in patients with septic shock [^5d5cec61]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

The interpretation of serum procalcitonin (PCT) levels in septic patients is facilitated by reviewing the known stimuli that activate the PCT family of genes. Herein we describe 7 pathways that, alone or in combination, can increase serum PCT levels. As a marker of activation of innate immunity, high PCT levels affect clinical diagnosis, can be trended as a measure of "source" control, and can guide duration of antibacterial therapy in septic patients. Low PCT levels reflect little to no activation of an innate immune response, influence the differential diagnosis, and support the discontinuation of empiric antibiotic therapy. Understanding the pathways that result in elevated serum PCT levels is necessary for interpretation and subsequent clinical management.

### Cost-effectiveness of procalcitonin testing to guide antibiotic treatment duration in critically ill patients: results from a randomised controlled multicentre trial in the Netherlands [^af624f11]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusions

PCT-guided antibiotic treatment in ICU patients with sepsis is safe and reduces the duration of antibiotic use, while the overall impact on in-hospital costs (i.e. all healthcare-related costs occurring during the initial hospitalisation episode) is negligible (i.e. − €65, − 0.14%). When considering a one-year time frame, the high healthcare-related costs occurring in sepsis survivors may lead to a (non-significant) increase in costs of 3.8% with PCT compared with standard of care. Within this time-frame, the probability of PCT-guidance being cost-effective is 64% at a WTP of €80,000/QALY, although there is substantial uncertainty in the cost estimates. Furthermore, a one-year time frame is too short to capture the full potential impact of PCT guidance. Long-term follow-up studies are required to comprehensively quantify the cost-effectiveness of PCT guidance from a societal perspective. In addition, although it is expected that the benefits of PCT guidance may be more substantial in other countries and settings, this needs to be investigated in future studies.

Procalcitonin (PCT)–guided discontinuation in critically ill intensive care unit (ICU) patients is supported by several prospective randomized controlled trials (RCTs), with trials reporting significantly more antibiotic-free days (2–4 days) in the PCT arm without a mortality signal. A meta-analysis in ICU patients with severe sepsis or septic shock (including 7 studies and 1075 patients) found no significant difference in 28-day or hospital mortality and a median reduction of approximately 2 days in antibiotic duration with PCT guidance. In a European multicenter study of 621 septic patients, the PCT group had 2.7 more antibiotic-free days (P < .001), with antibiotic exposure per 1000 inpatient-days of 653 PCT vs 812 control.

Conclusion

In conclusion, PCT-guided antibiotic treatment in ICU patients with infection results in improved survival and shorter antibiotic treatment duration. Effects were similar in sepsis patients and among subgroups based on sepsis severity, sepsis treatment modalities, and type of infection. Whether the reduction in antibiotic exposure fully explains the mortality effects seen in our data needs to be investigated in future trials. These findings have substantial clinical and public health implications.

Procalcitonin (PCT) plus clinical criteria — diagnostic accuracy and panel stance for suspected HAP/VAP indicate high misclassification and no survival benefit from a PCT-guided escalation protocol. The false-negative and false-positive rates of serum PCT testing plus clinical criteria are 33% and 17%, respectively; assuming a prevalence of HAP/VAP of 50%, then for every 1000 patients with suspected HAP/VAP who are evaluated with serum PCT plus clinical criteria, 165 patients (16.5%) would be incorrectly diagnosed as not having HAP/VAP and 85 patients (8.5%) will be incorrectly diagnosed as having HAP/VAP. A recent trial randomized ICU patients to a PCT-guided antibiotic escalation protocol vs standard of care showed that the PCT-guided protocol did not result in survival improvement, but resulted in a higher number of ventilator-days and prolonged ICU stay. The panel agreed that the frequency of such undesirable consequences due to misleading PCT results was unacceptable and, therefore, recommended not using PCT to guide antibiotic initiation.

Influenza with suspected bacterial coinfection — biomarkers and antibiotic strategy: Unfortunately, there are few tools or diagnostic strategies that reliably differentiate influenza virus infection from bacterial influenza and bacterial coinfection. Procalcitonin (PCT) and C-reactive protein (CRP) have both been used; some data indicate that low levels of PCT, but not low levels of CRP, have high negative predictive value for bacterial coinfection, although clinical judgment is indicated. One systematic review and meta-analysis reported that PCT tests have high sensitivity, particularly for intensive care unit (ICU) patients, but low specificity to identify bacterial coinfection in influenza patients. One meta-analysis of data from patients with acute respiratory infections enrolled in 26 RCTs reported that procalcitonin-guided antibiotic treatment reduced 30-day mortality, antibiotic exposures, and antibiotic-related adverse effects.

### Efficacy and safety of procalcitonin guidance in patients with suspected or confirmed sepsis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^d7faabcf]. Critical Care Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

Sepsis is a leading cause of mortality in noncoronary ICUs. Although immediate start of antibiotics reduces sepsis-related mortality, antibiotics are often administered for too long, leading to suboptimal treatment and, importantly, contributes to antimicrobial resistance. Prior literature suggests that procalcitonin correlates with infection and thus may help to guide the decision on when to stop antibiotic treatment. This study was conducted as part of a regulatory submission to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and aimed to summarize the evidence of procalcitonin guidance on efficacy and safety outcomes in adult patients with sepsis.

Data Sources

PubMed and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews.

Study Selection

English-language randomized controlled trials evaluating procalcitonin use among adult patients with suspected or confirmed sepsis published between January 2004 and May 2016.

Data Extraction

Inverse-variance weighting fixed and random effects meta-analyses were performed on the following efficacy and safety endpoints: antibiotic duration, all-cause mortality, and length of ICU stay. Two reviewers independently extracted data elements from identified studies and measured risk of bias with the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool.

Data Synthesis

From a total of 369 potentially eligible articles, 10 randomized controlled trials containing 3,489 patients were used for analysis. Procalcitonin-guided patients had shorter antibiotics duration compared with controls (7.35 vs. 8.85 d; weighted mean difference, -1.49 d; 95% CI, -2.27 to -0.71; p < 0.001). Procalcitonin use had no adverse impact on mortality (risk ratio, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.79–1.03; p = 0.114) and length of ICU stay (11.09 d vs. 11.91 d; weighted mean difference, -0.84 d; 95% CI, -2.52 to 0.84; p = 0.329).

Conclusions

In adult patients with suspected or confirmed sepsis, procalcitonin guidance reduces antibiotics duration with no observed adverse effects on patient outcomes.

### Procalcitonin to guide duration of antibiotic therapy in intensive care patients: a randomized prospective controlled trial [^d73353dd]. Critical Care (2009). Low credibility.

Introduction

The development of resistance by bacterial species is a compelling issue to reconsider indications and administration of antibiotic treatment. Adequate indications and duration of therapy are particularly important for the use of highly potent substances in the intensive care setting. Until recently, no laboratory marker has been available to differentiate bacterial infection from viral or non-infectious inflammatory reaction; however, over the past years, procalcitonin (PCT) is the first among a large array of inflammatory variables that offers this possibility. The present study aimed to investigate the clinical usefulness of PCT for guiding antibiotic therapy in surgical intensive care patients.

Methods

All patients requiring antibiotic therapy based on confirmed or highly suspected bacterial infections and at least two concomitant systemic inflammatory response syndrome criteria were eligible. Patients were randomly assigned to either a PCT-guided (study group) or a standard (control group) antibiotic regimen. Antibiotic therapy in the PCT-guided group was discontinued, if clinical signs and symptoms of infection improved and PCT decreased to < 1 ng/ml or the PCT value was > 1 ng/ml, but had dropped to 25 to 35% of the initial value over three days. In the control group antibiotic treatment was applied as standard regimen over eight days.

Results

A total of 110 surgical intensive care patients receiving antibiotic therapy after confirmed or high-grade suspected infections were enrolled in this study. In 57 patients antibiotic therapy was guided by daily PCT and clinical assessment and adjusted accordingly. The control group comprised 53 patients with a standardized duration of antibiotic therapy over eight days. Demographic and clinical data were comparable in both groups. However, in the PCT group the duration of antibiotic therapy was significantly shorter than compared to controls (5.9 ± 1.7 versus 7.9 ± 0.5 days, P < 0.001) without negative effects on clinical outcome.

Conclusions

Monitoring of PCT is a helpful tool for guiding antibiotic treatment in surgical intensive care patients. This may contribute to an optimized antibiotic regimen with beneficial effects on microbial resistance and costs in intensive care medicine.

### The role of biomarkers in the diagnosis and management of pneumonia [^2a7b63f7]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Biomarkers are used in the diagnosis, severity determination, and prognosis for patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Selected biomarkers may indicate a bacterial infection and need for antibiotic therapy (C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells). Biomarkers can differentiate CAP patients who require hospital admission and severe CAP requiring intensive care unit admission. Biomarker-guided antibiotic therapy may limit antibiotic exposure without compromising outcome and thus improve antibiotic stewardship. The authors discuss the role of biomarkers in diagnosing, determining severity, defining the prognosis, and limiting antibiotic exposure in CAP and ventilator-associated pneumonia patients.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) — procalcitonin as a decision aid is limited; a recent study in hospitalized patients with CAP failed to identify a procalcitonin threshold that discriminated between viral and bacterial pathogens, and the reported sensitivity of procalcitonin to detect bacterial infection ranges from 38% to 91%, underscoring that this test alone cannot be used to justify withholding antibiotics from patients with CAP; although some patients with low procalcitonin levels have CAP and have been safely treated without antibiotics, these represent small subgroups, raising concerns about the safety of widely using such a strategy.

### Procalcitonin for triage of patients with respiratory tract symptoms: a case study in the trial design process for approval of a new diagnostic test for lower respiratory tract infections [^5207034c]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Symptoms of cough, fever, chest pain, and shortness of breath are common reasons that patients seek medical care, and they can be due to a variety of medical conditions, including lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI). Only a small proportion of these patients will actually have a bacterial etiology, but many will receive antibiotic treatment because physicians cannot readily determine the etiology at the time of presentation. Current diagnostic methodologies are not sensitive or specific enough to reliably distinguish bacterial from viral or noninfectious etiologies. Procalcitonin (PCT) is a marker of host response. PCT serum levels are elevated in patients with bacterial infection, compared with levels in those with viral infections or other inflammatory pulmonary conditions. Studies have suggested that the determination of PCT levels can identify a subset of patients with LRTI symptoms who can safely avoid antibiotic treatment. As with any new test, clinical trials are necessary to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the test to obtain U.S. Food and Drug Administration clearance. However, in the absence of standard reference methods for comparison that are reliably sensitive and specific, meeting the regulatory requirements for proof of safety and efficacy is a major challenge. Additional challenges include the choice of study design, the definition and determination of end points, and the justification of statistical analysis.

Other inflammatory markers — CRP and procalcitonin in early-onset sepsis assessment: "Both CRP and procalcitonin concentrations increase in newborn infants in response to a variety of inflammatory stimuli", and "Procalcitonin concentrations also increase naturally over the first 24 to 36 hours after birth". Consequently, "Single values of CRP or procalcitonin obtained after birth to assess the risk of EOS are neither sufficiently sensitive nor specific to guide EOS care decisions". "Consistently normal values of CRP and procalcitonin over the first 48 hours of age are associated with the absence of EOS, but serial abnormal values alone should not be used to extend antibiotic therapy in the absence of a culture-confirmed infection".

### Procalcitonin to initiate or discontinue antibiotics in acute respiratory tract infections [^957d0821]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Acute respiratory infections (ARIs) comprise of a large and heterogeneous group of infections including bacterial, viral, and other aetiologies. In recent years, procalcitonin (PCT), a blood marker for bacterial infections, has emerged as a promising tool to improve decisions about antibiotic therapy (PCT-guided antibiotic therapy). Several randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have demonstrated the feasibility of using procalcitonin for starting and stopping antibiotics in different patient populations with ARIs and different settings ranging from primary care settings to emergency departments, hospital wards, and intensive care units. However, the effect of using procalcitonin on clinical outcomes is unclear. This is an update of a Cochrane review and individual participant data meta-analysis first published in 2012 designed to look at the safety of PCT-guided antibiotic stewardship.

Objectives

The aim of this systematic review based on individual participant data was to assess the safety and efficacy of using procalcitonin for starting or stopping antibiotics over a large range of patients with varying severity of ARIs and from different clinical settings.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), which contains the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialised Register, MEDLINE, and Embase, in February 2017, to identify suitable trials. We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov to identify ongoing trials in April 2017.

Selection Criteria

We included RCTs of adult participants with ARIs who received an antibiotic treatment either based on a procalcitonin algorithm (PCT-guided antibiotic stewardship algorithm) or usual care. We excluded trials if they focused exclusively on children or used procalcitonin for a purpose other than to guide initiation and duration of antibiotic treatment.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two teams of review authors independently evaluated the methodology and extracted data from primary studies. The primary endpoints were all-cause mortality and treatment failure at 30 days, for which definitions were harmonised among trials. Secondary endpoints were antibiotic use, antibiotic-related side effects, and length of hospital stay. We calculated odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using multivariable hierarchical logistic regression adjusted for age, gender, and clinical diagnosis using a fixed-effect model. The different trials were added as random-effects into the model. We conducted sensitivity analyses stratified by clinical setting and type of ARI. We also performed an aggregate data meta-analysis.

Main Results

From 32 eligible RCTs including 18 new trials for this 2017 update, we obtained individual participant data from 26 trials including 6708 participants, which we included in the main individual participant data meta-analysis. We did not obtain individual participant data for four trials, and two trials did not include people with confirmed ARIs. According to GRADE, the quality of the evidence was high for the outcomes mortality and antibiotic exposure, and quality was moderate for the outcomes treatment failure and antibiotic-related side effects. Primary endpoints: there were 286 deaths in 3336 procalcitonin-guided participants (8.6%) compared to 336 in 3372 controls (10.0%), resulting in a significantly lower mortality associated with procalcitonin-guided therapy (adjusted OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.70 to 0.99, P = 0.037). We could not estimate mortality in primary care trials because only one death was reported in a control group participant. Treatment failure was not significantly lower in procalcitonin-guided participants (23.0% versus 24.9% in the control group, adjusted OR 0.90, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.01, P = 0.068). Results were similar among subgroups by clinical setting and type of respiratory infection, with no evidence for effect modification (P for interaction > 0.05). Secondary endpoints: procalcitonin guidance was associated with a 2.4-day reduction in antibiotic exposure (5.7 versus 8.1 days, 95% CI -2.71 to -2.15, P < 0.001) and lower risk of antibiotic-related side effects (16.3% versus 22.1%, adjusted OR 0.68, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.82, P < 0.001). Length of hospital stay and intensive care unit stay were similar in both groups. A sensitivity aggregate-data analysis based on all 32 eligible trials showed similar results.

Authors' Conclusions

This updated meta-analysis of individual participant data from 12 countries shows that the use of procalcitonin to guide initiation and duration of antibiotic treatment results in lower risks of mortality, lower antibiotic consumption, and lower risk for antibiotic-related side effects. Results were similar for different clinical settings and types of ARIs, thus supporting the use of procalcitonin in the context of antibiotic stewardship in people with ARIs. Future high-quality research is needed to confirm the results in immunosuppressed patients and patients with non-respiratory infections.

The clinical algorithm for antibiotic stewardship in patients with respiratory tract infections in the Emergency Department encourages (> 0.5 μg/l or > 0.25 μg/l) or discourages (< 0.1 μg/l or < 0.25 μg/l) initiation or continuation of antibiotic therapy more or less based on PCT specific cut-off ranges. Abbreviations: AB, antibiotic; LRTI, lower respiratory tract infection; PCT, procalcitonin; PSI, Pneumonia Severity Score.

Figure 3
PCT algorithm in patients with sepsis in the ICU. In critically ill patients in the ICU, cut-offs are higher and initial empiric antibiotic therapy should be encouraged in all patients with suspicion of sepsis. PCT cut-offs are helpful in the subsequent days after admission to shorten the courses of antibiotic therapy in patients with clinical improvement. Abbreviations: AB, antibiotic; PCT, procalcitonin.

The first intervention study testing PCT as a guide for antibiotic decisions included patients with different types and severities of respiratory infections. Clinical outcomes for both groups were similar, but the PCT-guided group had markedly lower rates of antibiotic prescriptions (44% versus 83%), particularly in patients with ECOPD and acute bronchitis. Two subsequent trials evaluated the effect of PCT guidance for antibiotic discontinuation in CAP and ECOPD. PCT guidance reduced the duration of antibiotic therapy by 65% in CAP patients and the prescription of antibiotics from 72% to 40% in ECOPD patients. A subsequent multicenter trial confirmed earlier results and found a reduction of antibiotics by 32% in CAP, by 50% in ECOPD and by 65% in acute bronchitis. Again, antibiotic exposure in ECOPD and acute bronchitis decreased mainly by not initiating treatment at all, whereas for CAP it was principally from reduction in duration of therapy. Importantly, the overall rate of adverse events was similar in both study arms and excluded a risk of more than 0.4% for PCT guided patients. Interestingly, patients with bacteremia CAP had markedly increased PCT concentrations resulting in longer treatment duration compared to culture-negative CAP patients with a lower infection-related risk. Similar results in patients with respiratory infections were also reported in trials from Denmark and China, and recently from an observational 'real life'- quality control survey in Switzerland.
