REM disorders

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD), including its definition, pathophysiology, epidemiology, diagnosis, differential diagnosis, management, prognosis, and special populations, with explicit citations throughout. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core definition and diagnostic criteria. Then, I should verify the pathophysiology and why RBD matters prognostically. Next, I will review epidemiology and risk factors. After that, I need to check the diagnostic approach, including polysomnography and mimics. Then, I will examine management, including safety, pharmacotherapy, and drug-induced RBD. Finally, I will consider prognosis, special populations, and controversies, and close with a concise synthesis that ties these elements together with appropriate citations.

> Let me first confirm the definition and diagnostic framework. RBD is a parasomnia characterized by repeated dream-enactment behaviors during REM sleep with loss of normal skeletal muscle atonia, documented by video-polysomnography as REM sleep without atonia, and not better explained by another sleep disorder, medication, or substance; this is the ICSD-3 construct and is echoed by contemporary reviews and guidelines, so I should anchor on that to avoid overcalling clinical impressions without objective confirmation [^3cad0401] [^d7167206] [^41df1c13].

> Wait, let me verify the pathophysiology before drawing conclusions. The core mechanism is dysfunction of brainstem circuits that maintain REM atonia, particularly the sublaterodorsal nucleus and magnocellular medullary pathways, with emerging evidence that many cases reflect early α-synucleinopathy; this aligns with the observation that idiopathic RBD frequently precedes Parkinson disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, or multiple system atrophy by years to decades, making iRBD a prodromal state rather than a truly idiopathic condition in most older adults [^d7167206] [^2fa61da8] [^a7c3e9bb].

> I need to check epidemiology and risk modifiers. Population-based studies suggest PSG-confirmed RBD in roughly 1–1.3% of adults, with higher prevalence in older men and strong associations with antidepressant exposure; importantly, antidepressant-associated RBD is particularly common in younger patients and may represent either iatrogenic disease or unmasking of underlying synucleinopathy, so I should be cautious about labeling such cases as isolated RBD without careful follow-up [^16195c8d] [^0176f94d] [^96061232].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about diagnosis without reviewing the gold standard. Definitive diagnosis requires video-polysomnography demonstrating REM sleep without atonia and exclusion of mimics; questionnaires like the RBDSQ can screen but have imperfect sensitivity/specificity, and actigraphy or home monitoring may aid access but do not replace vPSG, so I should confirm that any suspected case is backed by objective sleep study when feasible [^3cad0401] [^41df1c13] [^3cad0401].

> Next, I should review the differential and common mimics. Obstructive sleep apnea can produce movements during REM that resemble RBD, non-REM parasomnias arise from slow-wave sleep with partial arousal, and nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy presents with stereotyped, often brief, hypermotor events; distinguishing these entities often hinges on vPSG with EEG and respiratory channels, and I need to ensure I do not conflate state-dependent behaviors with RBD [^49485b26] [^7babbc1d] [^a97249e2].

> I will now examine management, starting with safety, because injury prevention is paramount. The AASM recommends universal safety counseling: remove weapons and sharp objects from the bedroom, pad furniture edges, place a mattress or rug beside the bed, and consider separate sleeping arrangements when episodes are violent; I should double-check that these are framed as good-practice statements rather than optional suggestions, which they are [^96c667fb] [^6ac1585b] [^0c6461db].

> Let me think about pharmacotherapy and the strength of evidence. Clonazepam and immediate-release melatonin are first-line symptomatic options with conditional recommendations from the AASM; typical melatonin dosing is 3–12 mg at bedtime, and clonazepam 0.5–2 mg is commonly used, though high-quality randomized data are limited and some critics argue the evidence base is weaker than assumed, so I should counsel about benefits, falls risk, and the need for ongoing monitoring and dose titration [^458a25bc] [^142c9950] [^8a809757].

> But wait, what if the RBD is drug-induced. For antidepressant-associated RBD, the AASM suggests discontinuation of the offending agent if clinically safe, with consideration of alternatives with lower serotonergic burden such as bupropion; I should confirm that this is a conditional recommendation and that persistent symptoms after withdrawal warrant evaluation for isolated or secondary RBD and standard treatment pathways [^fb24f6f6] [^49f406f4] [^96061232].

> I should confirm the prognosis and counseling approach. Most older adults with isolated RBD convert to an α-synucleinopathy over 10–15 years, with large cohorts showing roughly 73–90% phenoconversion depending on follow-up and ascertainment; clinicians should offer patient-centered risk disclosure, discuss prodromal features, and connect patients with research registries and longitudinal follow-up, while avoiding overpromising timelines or outcomes [^3042d4cf] [^2fa61da8] [^b24cd9b1].

> Let me consider special populations and nuances. In children and adolescents, RBD is rare and often secondary to neurodevelopmental disorders, narcolepsy, or medications; evidence for clonazepam or melatonin is limited, so I should individualize treatment and prioritize safety and etiologic workup rather than assuming an adult algorithm applies [^4c787b5d] [^e8d39638]. In PD, RBD is common and associated with a non-tremor phenotype, faster motor progression, and more non-motor burden, so its presence should prompt broader autonomic and cognitive screening and may influence prognostic counseling and trial eligibility [^d5105812] [^3fbff5dc].

> Hold on, I should verify emerging controversies and terminology. Many experts argue that "idiopathic" RBD is a misnomer because most cases harbor incipient α-synucleinopathy; proposals for a biology-driven lexicon that incorporate biomarkers such as α-synuclein assays, DaT-SPECT, and prodromal criteria are gaining traction, and I need to acknowledge that current labels may obscure heterogeneity and delay appropriate surveillance or trial enrollment [^09303e11] [^8974ec6d] [^d1b3acf0].

> In summary, RBD is a parasomnia defined by dream-enactment behaviors with REM sleep without atonia on vPSG, most often reflecting early α-synucleinopathy; diagnosis requires objective confirmation and exclusion of mimics, management prioritizes safety and conditional use of clonazepam or melatonin with individualized adjustments, and prognosis carries a high risk of neurodegeneration that warrants longitudinal counseling and research engagement; I should ensure my approach remains evidence-aligned and updated as biomarkers and trials evolve [^d7167206] [^458a25bc] [^2fa61da8].

REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is a parasomnia marked by **loss of REM atonia** [^d7167206] and **dream-enactment behaviors** that can cause injury [^a7c3e9bb]. Diagnosis requires **video-polysomnography** [^3cad0401] to confirm REM sleep without atonia and exclude mimics [^49485b26]. RBD is strongly linked to α-synucleinopathies (PD, DLB, MSA) [^2fa61da8], with > 80% risk of conversion over 10–15 years [^b11bb8a4]; thus, patients need counseling on neurodegenerative risk and safety measures [^b24cd9b1]. First-line treatment is **melatonin 3–12 mg** [^142c9950] or **clonazepam 0.5–2 mg** at bedtime [^3fbff5dc]; if antidepressant-induced, taper or switch agents when feasible [^fb24f6f6]. Prognosis is poor for neurodegeneration, but symptomatic control and injury prevention are effective [^d7167206].

---

## Clinical features

- **Dream-enactment behaviors**: Talking, shouting, punching, kicking, jumping, or gesturing during REM sleep [^a9429485].
- **Injury risk**: Frequent injuries to patients and bed partners; severity varies from mild to life-threatening [^a7c3e9bb].
- **Awareness**: Patients often recall dream content and are unaware of behaviors unless witnessed [^d7167206].

---

## Pathophysiology

RBD reflects **loss of normal REM atonia** due to brainstem dysfunction involving the sublaterodorsal nucleus and magnocellular reticular formation [^4c5f3113]. It is tightly linked to α-synucleinopathies (PD, DLB, MSA) [^2fa61da8], often preceding motor/cognitive symptoms by years [^a7c3e9bb].

---

## Diagnostic criteria and methods

Per ICSD-3, diagnosis requires:

| **Criterion** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| A | Repeated episodes of sleep-related vocalization/complex motor behaviors during REM sleep [^3cad0401] |
| B | Behaviors documented on PSG as occurring during REM sleep or presumed REM based on history [^3cad0401] |
| C | PSG demonstrates REM sleep without atonia (RSWA) [^3cad0401] |
| D | Not better explained by another sleep disorder, mental disorder, medication, or substance [^3cad0401] |

---

Video-polysomnography is the **gold standard** [^3cad0401] to confirm RSWA and exclude mimics (OSA, NREM parasomnias, nocturnal seizures) [^49485b26]. Screening tools (e.g. RBDSQ) are useful but not diagnostic [^41df1c13].

---

## Differential diagnosis

- **Obstructive sleep apnea**: Can mimic RBD with arousal-related movements [^49485b26].
- **NREM parasomnias**: Sleepwalking, sleep terrors, confusional arousals [^7babbc1d].
- **Nocturnal seizures**: Stereotyped, brief, often with postictal confusion [^a97249e2].
- **Medication-induced RBD**: SSRIs, SNRIs, TCAs, MAOIs can trigger or worsen RBD [^f702725d].

---

## Management

### Non-pharmacological interventions

Non-pharmacological care centers on **safety counseling** — removing weapons/sharp objects, padding furniture, placing mattresses on the floor, and using separate bedrooms when needed [^6ac1585b] [^0c6461db]. Education for patients and bed partners about injury risk and monitoring for disease progression is essential [^b24cd9b1].

---

### Pharmacological treatments

- **Melatonin**: 3–12 mg at bedtime; first-line due to favorable safety profile [^142c9950] [^458a25bc].
- **Clonazepam**: 0.5–2 mg at bedtime; effective but monitor for sedation, falls, and cognitive effects [^3fbff5dc] [^458a25bc].
- **Drug-induced RBD**: Taper or switch antidepressants when feasible; consider bupropion or other lower-serotonergic options [^fb24f6f6] [^96061232].

---

## Prognosis and risk of neurodegeneration

Isolated RBD confers a **high risk of α-synucleinopathy** [^2fa61da8]: ~46% at 5 years, ~73% at 12 years, and ~90% at 14 years [^b11bb8a4]. Predictors of faster conversion include abnormal DaT-SPECT, hyposmia, autonomic dysfunction, and cognitive impairment [^f661bd3f] [^c8cfca2c].

---

## Special considerations

- **Pediatric RBD**: Rare; often secondary to narcolepsy, neurodevelopmental disorders, or medications [^4c787b5d] [^0b65056d].
- **Antidepressant-associated RBD**: Common in younger patients; reassess medication strategy [^0176f94d] [^96061232].
- **Comorbidities**: OSA, periodic limb movements, and other sleep disorders may coexist and require targeted therapy [^49485b26].

---

REM sleep behavior disorder is a **treatable parasomnia** with major neurodegenerative implications [^d7167206]. Accurate diagnosis with video-polysomnography, safety-first management, and judicious use of melatonin or clonazepam are core pillars of care, alongside counseling on the high risk of future α-synucleinopathy and longitudinal monitoring for prodromal features [^458a25bc] [^b24cd9b1].

### Sleep disorders… [^20895b90]. NCI (2024). Medium credibility.

Sleep has two main phases that repeat during the sleeping period. There are two main phases of sleep, and both are needed in order to get "a good night's sleep. " The two main phases of sleep are rapid eye movement and non-rapid eye movement:

- REM sleep, also known as "dream sleep, " is the phase of sleep in which the brain is active.
- NREM is the quiet or restful phase of sleep. It has four stages, from light sleep to deep sleep. The phases of sleep repeat during the night in a cycle of a non-REM phase followed by a REM phase. Each cycle lasts about 90 minutes and is repeated 4 to 6 times during 7 to 8 hours of sleep.
- **Insomnia**: Being unable to fall asleep and stay asleep.
- **Sleep apnea**: A breathing disorder in which breathing stops for 10 seconds or more during sleep.
- **Hypersomnia**: Being unable to stay awake during the day.
- **Circadian rhythm disorders**: Problems with the sleep-wake cycle, making you unable to sleep and wake at the right times.
- Parasomnia: Acting in unusual ways while falling asleep, sleeping, or waking from sleep, such as walking, talking, or eating. Sleep disorders keep you from having a good night's sleep. This may make it hard for you to stay alert and involved in activities during the day. Sleep disorders can cause problems for people with cancer. You may not be able to remember treatment instructions and may have trouble making decisions. Being well-rested can improve energy and help you cope with side effects of cancer and treatment. Sleep problems that go on for a long time may increase the risk of anxiety or depression. Sleep disorders are common in people with cancer. As many as half of people with cancer have problems sleeping. The sleep disorders most likely to affect people with cancer are insomnia and an abnormal sleep-wake cycle. There are many reasons you may have trouble sleeping, including:

- Physical changes caused by the cancer or surgery.
- Side effects of drugs or other treatments.
- Being in the hospital.
- Stress about having cancer.
- Health problems not related to the cancer. Some drugs that help you sleep should not be stopped suddenly. Suddenly stopping them may cause nervousness, seizures, and a change in the REM phase of sleep that increases dreaming, including nightmares. This change in REM sleep may be dangerous for people with peptic ulcers or heart conditions.

### Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder: a review of the literature and update on current concepts [^01b5dbc1]. Chest (2017). Low credibility.

Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is characterized by abnormal behaviors emerging during REM sleep that may cause injury or sleep disruption. The diagnosis requires polysomnography (PSG) demonstrating a loss of normal skeletal muscle atonia during REM sleep. RBD results from dysfunction of the brain stem circuits responsible for maintaining normal REM sleep atonia and suppressing behaviors during REM sleep. The diagnosis of idiopathic RBD (IRBD), that is, RBD without an identifiable cause, is frequently followed years later by the development of a neurodegenerative disorder, most commonly one of the synucleinopathies. As such, RBD is often a step in the progression of a neurodegenerative disorder. In this circumstance, it is a manifestation of neurodegeneration occurring in the brain stem before spreading to adjacent and other CNS regions, resulting in the development of symptoms and signs that permit recognition of a specific neurodegenerative disorder. RBD has been linked with narcolepsy and has been associated with a variety of other disorders. The management of RBD focuses on preventive/safety measures, counseling, monitoring for the development of a neurodegenerative disorder, and pharmacotherapy, which is typically effective but not well understood. The purpose of this article is to review and update our current understanding of the clinical features, epidemiology, demographics, pathophysiology, evaluation, diagnosis, differential diagnosis, causes, associations, and the clinical management of RBD.

### Is REM sleep behavior disorder a friend or foe of obstructive sleep apnea? Clinical and etiological implications for neurodegeneration [^6dd7bb1d]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

None

Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is a parasomnia characterized by loss of muscle atonia during rapid eye movement sleep, associated with complex motor enactment of dreams. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a relatively common sleep disorder characterized by repetitive episodes of upper airway obstruction while sleeping, which can result in hypoxemia and sleep fragmentation. Even though the nature of RBD and OSA is different, OSA may sometimes be accompanied by RBD symptoms. Accordingly, it is reasonable to distinguish these 2 sleep disorders in people with dream enactment behaviors. Although RBD and OSA share similar sleep phenomena, their association has yet to be elucidated. Herein we draw attention to various RBD-mimicking conditions, RBD combined with OSA, and the relationship between RBD and OSA. Furthermore, the clinical implications of OSA in neurodegeneration and the optimized management of RBD combined with OSA are also discussed in this review.

### Brain-clinical biotyping in patients with idiopathic REM sleep behavior disorder [^c8cfca2c]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Idiopathic/isolated REM sleep behavior disorder (iRBD) is a distinct parasomnia characterized by the enactment of dreams and excessive electromyographic activity during REM sleep (REM sleep without atonia, RSWA). Recent evidence indicates that iRBD serves as a specific prodromal stage of α-synucleinopathies, such as Parkinson's disease (PD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and multiple system atrophy (MSA), with over 90% of iRBD patients converting to α-synucleinopathies within 15 years. Therefore, recognizing iRBD and its associated neurodegenerative biomarkers is crucial for identifying the prodromal stage of α-synucleinopathies and predicting disease progression. Several biomarkers have been identified in iRBD that may potentially forecast a faster disease progression, including autonomic dysfunction, olfactory loss, color vision impairment, neurocognitive impairment, dopamine dysfunction, excessive daytime sleepiness, depression, and motor function abnormalities.

Meanwhile, increasing evidence underscores PD, DLB, and MSA as heterogeneous conditions, with potential subtypes exhibiting distinct clinical features and underlying mechanisms. For example, previous endeavors have aimed at delineating different subtypes of PD and DLB via clinical, and imaging biomarkers. However, the heterogeneity of α-synucleinopathies might manifest not only at disease onset but also during its prodromal stage, characterized by the initial neuroanatomical spread of α-synuclein aggregates. Thus, identifying different biotypes of iRBD will be helpful for facilitating understanding of iRBD heterogeneity and, as well as optimizing the efficacy of neuroprotective interventions.

A recent study has identified two subtypes of iRBD based on clinical symptoms, with subtype 1 characterized by higher non-motor symptom burden and widespread reduction of cortical gray matter volume than subtype 2. However, the accuracy and reproducibility of these classification systems, grounded solely on clinical data, may have been limited. An alternative and potentially more robust approach to categorizing patients with iRBD is to implement data integration techniques beyond using neuroimaging or behavioral/clinical features alone to identify brain-clinical biotypes. This method offers the advantage of objectively capturing a diverse aspect of patient characteristics and exploring biological heterogeneity in vivo. By employing data-driven methods, researchers can achieve an unbiased detection of patient groups with similar brain-behavior profiles.

### Evaluating the efficacy and safety of PROSOMNIA sleep therapy… [^3ffa6b55]. ClinicalTrials (2024). Medium credibility.

Significance: Chronic insomnia and REM sleep disorders affect millions globally, leading to cognitive impairment, mood disturbances, and poor overall health. Traditional treatments, including pharmacological approaches and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia, often provide suboptimal results for many individuals. PSTx offers a novel, therapeutic approach to restoring sleep balance and enhancing the overall quality of sleep, particularly for those who have not responded to conventional treatments. Key Concepts: Homeostatic sleep drive, caused by adenosine buildup during wakefulness, is disrupted by chronic insomnia. This impacts cognitive function health and recovery. Anesthesia-induced REM sleep via PSTx helps regulate this homeostatic sleep stage, offering deeper and more restorative sleep compared to other sleep therapies. The study uses statistical methods like ANOVA and Chi-square to measure outcomes.

The clinical trial aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of PROSOMNIA Sleep Therapy, an innovative anesthesia-induced treatment, for patients experiencing chronic insomnia, sleep deprivation, and REM sleep disorders. Chronic insomnia, characterized by persistent difficulty falling or staying asleep, often disrupts sleep homeostasis, affecting cognitive function, mood, and overall quality of life. Conventional treatments, such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia and pharmacological interventions, frequently yield suboptimal results, making this trial critical for those unresponsive to standard therapies. Mechanism and Methodology: PROSOMNIA Sleep Therapy uses a novel approach to target the homeostatic sleep drive by leveraging Diprivan/Propofol, an anesthetic that acts on GABAₐ receptors to induce and maintain REM sleep. This process addresses sleep pressure caused by adenosine buildup during wakefulness, promoting its clearance during REM sleep.

This controlled anesthesia-induced therapy aims to restore disrupted sleep homeostasis and optimize REM sleep architecture. Study Objectives: The primary objectives are to determine if PSTx increases REM sleep duration, reduces sleep onset latency, and improves overall sleep quality. Secondary objectives include assessing changes in mood, cognitive function, and biochemical markers. Broader Implications: PROSOMNIA Sleep Therapy's innovative method could have broader applications beyond insomnia, including treating mental health disorders, neurodegenerative diseases, and enhancing cardiovascular and metabolic health. Athletes or individuals recovering from injury may also benefit from improved sleep quality and recovery.

### REM sleep behavior disorder and Alzheimer's disease: definitely No relationship? [^e80e2391]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2018). Low credibility.

Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is a REM sleep parasomnia characterized by the loss of the typical muscular atonia present during healthy REM sleep. RBD can occur in the absence of other neurological conditions or in association with a neurodegenerative disorder. It is now well established that RBD is a strong predictor of neurodegeneration, in particular synucleinopathies, such as Parkinson's disease, Lewy body dementia (LBD), or multiple system atrophy. However, some longitudinal studies report that a minority of patients develop either overlapping form of dementia or Alzheimer disease's (AD). Although AD is reported as a possible development in patients with RBD, it is in a limited number of cases and there are concerns about the accuracy of the diagnostic criteria. Neuropsychological impairments identified in cross-sectional studies of RBD patients describe a profile similar to that observed in dementia related to synucleinopathies. However, only deficits in executive function predict the development of neurodegeneration. Longitudinal studies reported the development of AD in RBD patients in about 7% of cases with variability ranging from 3% and 11%. Since the majority of longitudinal investigations do not report AD as a possible development for RBD patients the proportion may be overestimated. The study of the relationship between RBD and AD may be confounded by two factors that lead to misdiagnosis: the use of clinical criteria alone and the overlap between the clinical features and neuropathology of AD and LBD. Future studies to investigate this association must use updated diagnostic criteria incorporating ancillary investigations.

### Prodromal features and risk of neurodegenerative disorders diagnosis in outpatients with REM sleep behavior disorder [^1c7919a5]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Study Objectives

Individuals with isolated REM sleep behavior disorder (iRBD) are at high risk of neurodegenerative parkinsonian disorders or dementia (NPD). Determining which characteristics predict greatest risk could improve clinical care. Our objectives were to utilize electronic health record (EHR) data to apply prodromal PD research diagnostic criteria to iRBD outpatients and determine their utility for identifying iRBD cases at high vs low risk for NPD diagnosis.

Methods

This was a retrospective cohort study at a tertiary care center in Western Pennsylvania. Diagnosis of iRBD was confirmed with expert manual chart review. Prodromal risk markers and signs/symptoms were determined with diagnostic codes. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models examined a range of covariates as predictors of time to NPD diagnosis.

Results

Of 448 iRBD cases, 82 (18.30%) were diagnosed with NPD. Forty-nine (10.93%) had > 80% prodromal PD probability. There was no difference in time to NPD among those who met vs did not meet > 80% probability (log rank p = 0.49). In a Cox model that included all assessed criteria features, risk of diagnosis was associated with male sex (HR = 2.06, 95%CI 1.04–1.10), older baseline age (HR = 1.07; 95%CI 1.05–1.10), and cognitive dysfunction diagnostic code (HR = 2.83, 95%CI 1.79–4.46). Time to NPD diagnosis among predicted high- vs low- risk cases was significantly different (Log-rank test p = 0.012).

Conclusions

In outpatients with iRBD, a model combining individual PD risk factors and prodromal features accurately identifies individuals at high risk for NPD diagnosis. Results demonstrate the potential of EHR data to translate research on prodromal PD to the clinic.

### Clinical trials in REM sleep behavioural disorder: challenges and opportunities [^0adfbb8e]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

The rapid eye movement sleep behavioural disorder (RBD) population is an ideal study population for testing disease-modifying treatments for synucleinopathies, since RBD represents an early prodromal stage of synucleinopathy when neuropathology may be more responsive to treatment. While clonazepam and melatonin are most commonly used as symptomatic treatments for RBD, clinical trials of symptomatic treatments are also needed to identify evidence-based treatments. A comprehensive framework for both disease-modifying and symptomatic treatment trials in RBD is described, including potential treatments in the pipeline, cost-effective participant recruitment and selection, study design, outcomes and dissemination of results. For disease-modifying treatment clinical trials, the recommended primary outcome is phenoconversion to an overt synucleinopathy, and stratification features should be used to select a study population at high risk of phenoconversion, to enable more rapid clinical trials. For symptomatic treatment clinical trials, objective polysomnogram-based measurement of RBD-related movements and vocalisations should be the primary outcome measure, rather than subjective scales or diaries. Mobile technology to enable objective measurement of RBD episodes in the ambulatory setting, and advances in imaging, biofluid, tissue, and neurophysiological biomarkers of synucleinopathies, will enable more efficient clinical trials but are still in development. Increasing awareness of RBD among the general public and medical community coupled with timely diagnosis of these diseases will facilitate progress in the development of therapeutics for RBD and associated neurodegenerative disorders.

### Clinical subtypes in patients with isolated REM sleep behaviour disorder [^607a5166]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2023). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, this study demonstrated distinct clinical subtypes in patients with iRBD, elucidating relevant differences in the expression of symptoms and potential disease trajectories primarily based on non-motor assessments. We are convinced that subtyping patients within the prodromal stage will improve the understanding of the underlying pathological pathways and hopefully help guide therapeutic decisions in the near future.

### REM sleep behavior disorder: mimics and variants [^49485b26]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is a parasomnia with dream-enactment behaviors occurring during REM sleep and associated with the lack of the physiological REM sleep muscle atonia. It can be isolated and secondary to other neurological or medical conditions. Isolated RBD heralds in most cases a neurodegenerative condition due to an underlying synucleinopathy and consequently its recognition is crucial for prognostic implications. REM sleep without atonia on polysomnography is a mandatory diagnostic criterion. Different conditions may mimic RBD, the most frequent being obstructive sleep apnea during sleep, non-REM parasomnia, and sleep-related hypermotor epilepsy. These diseases might also be comorbid with RBD, challenging the evaluation of disease severity, the treatment choices and the response to treatment evaluation. Video-PSG is the gold standard for a correct diagnosis and will distinguish between different or comorbid sleep disorders. Careful history taking together with actigraphy may give important clues for the differential diagnosis. The extreme boundaries of RBD might also be seen in more severe and complex conditions like status dissociatus or in the sleep disorders' scenario of anti IgLON5 disease, but in the latter both clinical and neurophysiological features will differ. A step-by-step approach is suggested to guide the differential diagnosis.

### Clinical subtypes in patients with isolated REM sleep behaviour disorder [^3ac44959]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cumulating evidence revealed a broad heterogeneity in clinical presentation and disease progression in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Many attempts to identify PD subtypes have been carried out in the past, primarily focussing on motor symptoms. However, PD heterogeneity may not start at disease onset — formally based on the presence of motor symptoms — but already at its prodromal stage during the incipient spread of α-synuclein aggregates. This stage is characterised by the occurrence of NMS but no or only mild motor symptoms. Hence, analysis of variation in NMS, including sleep disturbances, hyposmia, autonomic dysfunction, and cognitive impairment, might be essential for early identification of subtypes.

Isolated rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behaviour disorder (iRBD) is presumed to be the most specific marker of prodromal PD. iRBD is characterised by dream-enacting behaviours and the loss of physiological muscle atonia during REM sleep. Longitudinal studies have demonstrated that patients with iRBD not only convert to classic 'motor-dominant' PD (~50% of converters), but a nearly similar proportion of patients (~45%) converts to a 'dementia phenotype' with relevant cognitive impairment. In stark contrast, ~5% of patients with iRBD convert to multiple system atrophy (MSA). Thus, iRBD indicates the stage of an emerging α-synucleinopathy and represents a heterogeneous population. Additionally, considerable variability of the temporal sequence and prevalence of NMS as well as time to phenoconversion have been observed in patients with iRBD.

### Challenges in diagnosing NREM parasomnias: implications for future diagnostic classifications [^3f667d8f]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

NREM parasomnias are frequent and potentially disabling sleep disorders characterized by recurrent abnormal behaviors emerging from NREM sleep. Recently, several studies provided more detailed clinical and polysomnographic characterization of NREM parasomnia which may enhance the diagnostic process. Several revisions of the diagnostic criteria have been proposed in the classification of sleep disorders, the latest being ICSD-3-TR in 2023 with no changes on NREM parasomnias since ICSD-3 published in 2014. We performed an extensive literature review to assess the evidence on the procedure of its diagnosis. We dissected the inconsistencies and shortcomings in the ICSD-3-TR to propose a revision of the current diagnostic criteria. We highlighted the limits of several clinical criteria which should rather be supportive features than mandatory criteria. Infrared cameras with video-recordings with are promising tools to precisely characterize home episodes. Sensitive and specific polysomnographic markers of NREM parasomnias have been identified and should be considered in future revisions. We also suggest the use of diagnostic specifiers (clinical subtypes, clinical significance, levels of severity, age effect, levels of certainty) to define homogeneous subgroups of patients for therapeutic intervention and research purposes. In conclusion, we advocate for significant changes in the current diagnostic criteria of NREM parasomnias for future classification.

Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behaviour disorder (RBD) is characterised by complex motor enactment of dreams and is a potential prodromal marker of Parkinson's disease (PD). Of note, patients with PD observed during RBD episodes exhibit improved motor function, relative to baseline states during wake periods. Here, we review recent epidemiological and mechanistic findings supporting the prodromal value of RBD for PD, incorporating clinical and electrophysiological studies. Explanations for the improved motor function during RBD episodes are evaluated in light of recent publications. In addition, we present preliminary findings describing changes in the activity of the basal ganglia across the sleep-wake cycle that contribute to our understanding of RBD.

### Idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder: a potential gateway to the development of disease-modifying treatments in neurodegenerative disorders [^b11bb8a4]. Journal of Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Idiopathic rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavioural disorder (RBD) is classified as one of the REM parasomnias with clinical characteristics including unpleasant dreams, acting out of dreams, and loss of the typical muscle atonia during the REM phase of sleep. Other associated clinical features include olfactory loss, dysautonomia, colour vision impairment and subtle Parkinsonian signs. RBD has been shown to predict development of an alpha-synucleinopathy in 20–45% of patients within 5 years, and up to 92% within 14 years post-diagnosis. Hence, this disorder provides a potential opportunity for understanding the prodromal stages of the synucleinopathies and exploring efficacy of potential neuroprotective agents.

### Idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder: diagnosis, management, and the need for neuroprotective interventions [^a7c3e9bb]. The Lancet: Neurology (2016). Medium credibility.

Idiopathic rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behaviour disorder (IRBD) manifests as unpleasant dreams and vigorous behaviours during REM sleep that can result in injuries. Patients with IRBD have no known neurological diseases or motor or cognitive complaints; however, this sleep disorder is not harmless. In most cases, IRBD is the prelude of the synucleinopathies Parkinson's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, or, less frequently, multiple system atrophy. Patients can show abnormalities that are characteristic of the synucleinopathies, and longitudinal follow-up shows that most patients develop parkinsonism and cognitive impairments with time. Thus, diagnosis of IRBD needs to be accurate and involves informing the patient of the risk of developing a neurodegenerative disease. It is extraordinary for a sleep disorder to precede the full expression of a neurodegenerative disease, which renders IRBD of particular interest in studies of the prodromal stage of the synucleinopathies, and in the development of neuroprotective interventions to stop or slow neurodegenerative deterioration before motor and cognitive symptomatology emerges. Such therapeutics do not currently exist, and thus represent an unmet need in IRBD.

### Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder [^0fc2ed8a]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe the clinical features of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD), evaluate treatment options, and discuss management of patients with comorbid diseases.

Data Sources

A MEDLINE search (1977-April 2007) using the terms REM sleep behavior disorder, narcolepsy, parkinsonian disorders, levodopa, dopamine agonists, clonazepam, benzodiazepines, and melatonin was used to retrieve relevant articles. The reference sections of all articles and texts were scanned for additional literature.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All articles published in English were evaluated. There were no specific criteria for inclusion of articles in this review.

Data Synthesis

RBD is characterized by enactment of dream content resulting from the loss of normal skeletal muscle atonia during REM sleep. RBD occurs mainly in geriatric patients and in patients with neurodegenerative diseases, especially parkinsonian diseases. The presence of idiopathic RBD may be a sign of an underlying parkinsonian syndrome. Development of RBD may be one of the first manifestations of Parkinson's disease or other parkinsonian syndromes. An acute form of RBD can be drug-induced or occur on drug withdrawal. The potential for injury to the patient and his or her bed partner is as high as 96%. Controlled trials are unavailable for most agents used in the treatment of RBD, although clonazepam is an effective first-line agent and can provide rapid and complete symptom remission based on evidence from 3 large case series. Patients who cannot tolerate clonazepam or who have a suboptimal response may benefit from melatonin alone or as an adjunct. Both drugs are generally well tolerated when taken at bedtime. Management of patients with RBD becomes complicated due to the high incidence of neurologic comorbidity.

Conclusions

Clonazepam is the treatment of choice for patients with RBD. The drug is efficacious and has a low incidence of adverse effects. Melatonin is a viable second-line or adjunctive treatment.

### Idiopathic REM sleep behavior disorder: toward a better nosologic definition [^532e77cc]. Neurology (2005). Low credibility.

REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is a parasomnia characterized by a lack of motor inhibition during REM sleep leading to potentially harmful dream-enacting behaviors. RBD affects mainly older men and its prevalence in the general population is estimated to be around 0.5%. RBD may be idiopathic or associated with other neurologic disorders. A strong association between RBD and alpha-synucleinopathies has been recently observed, with the parasomnia often heralding the clinical onset of the neurodegenerative disease. The idiopathic form accounts for up to 60% of the cases reported in the three largest series of patients with RBD. Small clinical follow-up studies revealed that a proportion of these patients will eventually develop a parkinsonian syndrome or a dementia of Lewy bodies type in the years following the RBD diagnosis, while some patients will never show other neurologic signs within several decades from the RBD onset. Recent studies have looked at neurophysiologic and neuropsychological functions in idiopathic RBD and have found evidences of CNS dysfunction during both wakefulness and sleep. An impairment of the cortical activity, specific neuropsychological deficits, and signs of autonomic dysfunction have been observed in a variable proportion of these patients, challenging the concept of idiopathic RBD. Identifying subjects with a high risk of developing a neurodegenerative process may be crucial in order to develop early intervention strategies.

### DREAMER-isolateD REM sleep without atonia as a risk factor for… [^4daaf000]. ClinicalTrials (2023). Medium credibility.

Study Overview Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder is a parasomnia characterized by dream-enactment behaviors that emerge during a loss of REM sleep atonia. RBD-related dream enactment ranges in severity from benign hand gestures to violent thrashing, punching, and kicking. In spontaneously occurring cases, RBD is a prodromal syndrome of alpha-synuclein neurodegeneration. Thus, the vast majority of RBD patients will eventually demonstrate signs and symptoms of Parkinson disease or a related disorder, often after a prolonged interval. REM sleep without atonia is the hallmark of RBD and a required criterion of its diagnosis, in agreement with the International Classification of Sleep Disorders-3rd revision; however, RSWA has been reported also in subjects without RBD, as an 'incidental' finding or as an effect of antidepressants.

There is preliminary observational evidence that this "isolated" RSWA might indicate an increased risk for the future development of RBD, and its occurrence with antidepressants has been interpreted as a possible indication of an acceleration of a possible underlying neurodegeneration. The scientific community is actively seeking for effective neuroprotective agents, and the very early identification of subjects at risk, years or even decades before the occurrence of a clear neurodegeneration is crucially important. The cohort constituted with this study will be able to provide extremely useful answers to this problem. PSG exams will be used for the identification of subjects with RSWA by means of the computation of the REM atonia index.

In addition to the PSG recording, which will be performed in all subjects recruited, and in agreement with previous preliminary data produced by our groups on the possible detection of early subtle changes by means of other neurophysiological parameters, Unit 1 will also perform a transcranial magnetic stimulation study for the evaluation of the cortical excitability of subjects found having RSWA and in an adequate group of subjects without RSWA. Similarly, Unit 2 will perform a complete Vestibular Evoked Myogenic Potentials study of subjects found having RSWA and in an adequate group of subjects without RSWA, whereas Units 3 and 4 will ensure the recording of the Brainstem Auditory Evoked Potentials, which both evaluate the brainstem functioning.

### Characteristics of REM sleep behavior disorder in childhood [^4c787b5d]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Study Objective

To describe our experience regarding the clinical and polysomnographic features of REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) in childhood.

Methods

This was a retrospective chart review of children and adolescents with RBD and REM sleep without atonia. Demographics, and clinical and polysomnographic information were tabulated. Our findings were compared with those in the existing literature.

Results

The 15 subjects identified (13 RBD and 2 having REM sleep without atonia) had a mean age at diagnosis of 9.5 years (range 3–17 years); 11/15 (73%) were male. Nightmares were reported in 13/15 and excessive daytime sleepiness in 6/15. Two children had caused bodily harm to bedmate siblings. Comorbidities, which were multiple in some subjects, included anxiety (8/15), attention deficit disorder (10/15), nonspecific developmental delay (6/15), Smith-Magenis syndrome (1/15), pervasive developmental disorder (1/15), narcolepsy (1/15), idiopathic hypersomnia (1/15), and Moebius Syndrome (1/15). Abnormal MRI scans were seen in 5/8 evaluated subjects. Treatments consisted of clonazepam (10/15), melatonin (2/15), and discontinuation of a tricyclic agent (1/15), with a favorable response in 11 of 13. Two of 15 patients with REM sleep without atonia did not require pharmacotherapy.

Conclusions

RBD in children may be associated with neurodevelopmental disabilities, narcolepsy, or medication use. It seems to be modestly responsive to benzodiazepines or melatonin. The etiology is distinct from that of common childhood arousal parasomnias and RBD in adults; congenital and neurodevelopmental disorders, medication effect, and narcolepsy coexisted in some, but none had an extrapyramidal neurodegenerative disorder.

### Nonpharmacological… [^f4405e5f]. NCI (2025). Medium credibility.

Sleep consists of two phases:

- **Rapid eye movement sleep**: REM sleep, also known as dream sleep, is the active or paradoxic phase of sleep in which the brain is active.
- **Non-REM sleep**: NREM sleep is the quiet or restful phase of sleep. NREM, also referred to as slow-wave sleep, is divided into four stages of progressively deepening sleep based on electroencephalogram findings. The stages of sleep occur in a repeated pattern or cycle of NREM followed by REM, with each cycle lasting approximately 90 minutes. The sleep cycle is repeated four to six times during a 7- to 8-hour sleep period. The sleep-wake cycle is dictated by an inherent biological clock or circadian rhythm. Disruptions in individual sleep patterns can disrupt the circadian rhythm and impair the sleep cycle.

The Sleep Disorders Classification Committee of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine has identified five major categories of sleep disorders:

- Disorders of initiating and maintaining sleep.
- Sleep-related breathing disorders.
- Disorders of excessive somnolence.
- Disorders of the sleep-wake cycle.
- Dysfunctions associated with sleep, sleep stages, or partial arousals. Hypnotics can interfere with rapid eye movement sleep, resulting in increased irritability, apathy, and diminished mental alertness. Abrupt withdrawal of hypnotics and sedatives may lead to symptoms such as:

- Nervousness.
- Jitteriness.
- Seizures.
- REM rebound. REM rebound is a marked increase in REM sleep, with increased frequency and intensity of dreaming, including nightmares.

The increased physiological arousal that occurs during REM rebound may be dangerous for patients with peptic ulcers or a history of cardiovascular problems. Newer medications for insomnia have reduced adverse effects. The sleep of hospitalized patients is likely to be frequently interrupted by treatment schedules, hospital routines, and roommates, which singularly or collectively alter the sleep-wake cycle. Other factors influencing sleep-wake cycles in the hospital setting include patient age, comfort, pain, anxiety, environmental noise, and temperature.

5 Discussion

This longitudinal multicenter study aimed to describe the baseline and follow‐up characteristics of a large group of people diagnosed with iRBD, particularly by exploring the overlap between the nosological label of iRBD with pPD and pDLB labels. We found that the majority of iRBD patients fulfilled at least one of the pPD/pDLB labels, whereas approximately one‐third of them did not meet any of them. Interestingly, a non‐negligible portion (14.4%) of iRBD patients had both prodromal labels at the same time. Notably, the pPD/pDLB labels currently are for research purposes only, whereas iRBD is a nosological classification approved for clinical practice. These findings highlight the vast heterogeneity of iRBD patients, suggesting that patients may receive different diagnostic labels. Thus, they likely receive different health care approaches and management methods, including the use of different biomarkers to better characterize the disease, depending on the personal specific expertise of the consulting neurologist who first encounters the patient.

Most importantly, the use of pPD/pDLB labels has relevant prognostic value. Indeed, iRBD patients with pPD/pDLB labels have an increased risk of phenoconversion in the short term, especially when both criteria are met. This increased risk is expected because a certain number of clinical features are needed to fulfill pPD/pDLB labels. Thus, the presence of a prodromal label indirectly implies the presence of other neurological signs and symptoms. However, our data raise two intriguing issues. First, the specific clinical label (i.e. pPD or pDLB) did not predict the respective outcome (i.e. PD or DLB). This finding highlights the concept that PD and DLB are on the same clinical continuum, as also suggested in the new biological definition of PD and neuronal alpha‐synuclein disease, and confirms the notion that clinical data alone poorly predict the phenoconversion trajectory. Second, iRBD patients fulfilling both the pPD and pDLB criteria had the highest risk of phenoconversion in the short term. This finding is likely due to the presence of a multitude of clinical signs and symptoms in these subgroups of patients, allowing them to meet the criteria of both labels, which suggests the importance of a comprehensive clinical assessment in iRBD that should always include motor, cognitive, autonomic, and olfaction evaluations.

### Current concepts and controversies in the management of REM sleep behavior disorder [^936892eb]. Neurotherapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is characterized by dream enactment and the loss of muscle atonia during REM sleep, known as REM sleep without atonia (RSWA). RBD can result in significant injuries, prompting patients to seek medical attention. However, in others, it may present only as non-violent behaviors noted as an incidental finding during polysomnography (PSG). RBD typically occurs in the context of synuclein-based neurodegenerative disorders but can also be seen accompanying brain lesions and be exacerbated by medications, particularly antidepressants. There is also an increasing appreciation regarding isolated or idiopathic RBD (iRBD). Symptomatic treatment of RBD is a priority to prevent injurious complications, with usual choices being melatonin or clonazepam. The discovery that iRBD represents a prodromal stage of incurable synucleinopathies has galvanized the research community into delineating the pathophysiology of RBD and defining biomarkers of neurodegeneration that will facilitate future disease-modifying trials in iRBD. Despite many advances, there has been no progress in available symptomatic or neuroprotective therapies for RBD, with recent negative trials highlighting several challenges that need to be addressed to prepare for definitive therapeutic trials for patients with this disorder. These challenges relate to i) the diagnostic and screening strategies applied to RBD, ii) the limited evidence base for symptomatic therapies, (iii) the existence of possible subtypes of RBD, (iv) the relevance of triggering medications, (v) the absence of objective markers of severity, (vi) the optimal design of disease-modifying trials, and vii) the implications around disclosing the risk of future neurodegeneration in otherwise healthy individuals. Here, we review the current concepts in the therapeutics of RBD as it relates to the above challenges and identify pertinent research questions to be addressed by future work.

### Idiopathic REM sleep behaviour disorder and neurodegeneration-an update [^2fa61da8]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2018). Medium credibility.

So-called idiopathic rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behaviour disorder (RBD), formerly seen as a rare parasomnia, is now recognized as the prodromal stage of an α-synucleinopathy. Given the very high risk that patients with idiopathic RBD have of developing α-synucleinopathies, such as Parkinson disease (PD), PD dementia, dementia with Lewy bodies or multiple system atrophy, and the outstandingly high specificity and very long interval between the onset of idiopathic RBD and the clinical manifestations of α-synucleinopathies, the prodromal phase of this disorder represents a unique opportunity for potentially disease-modifying intervention. This Review provides an update on classic and novel biomarkers of α-synuclein-related neurodegeneration in patients with idiopathic RBD, focusing on advances in imaging and neurophysiological, cognitive, autonomic, tissue-specific and other biomarkers. We discuss the strengths, potential weaknesses and suitability of these biomarkers for identifying RBD and neurodegeneration, with an emphasis on predicting progression to overt α-synucleinopathy. The role of video polysomnography in providing quantifiable and potentially treatment-responsive biomarkers of neurodegeneration is highlighted. In light of all these advances, and the now understood role of idiopathic RBD as an early manifestation of α-synuclein disease, we call for idiopathic RBD to be reconceptualized as isolated RBD.

### Evolution of motor and nonmotor characteristics in an idiopathic / isolated REM sleep behavior disorder cohort [^f6b90af1]. Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Years before diagnosis of Parkinson disease (PD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), or multiple system atrophy (MSA), mild prodromal manifestations can be detected. Longitudinal follow-up of people with prodromal synucleinopathy, particularly idiopathic/isolated REM sleep behavior disorder (iRBD), enables in-depth clinical phenotyping of early disease, which could facilitate stratification for clinical trials, provide the definition of appropriate end points, or predict phenoconversion more precisely. The aim of this study was to update and expand on previous studies assessing clinical evolution from iRBD to clinically diagnosed disease, up to 14 years before diagnosis.

Methods

People with polysomnography-proven iRBD were included in this prospective cohort study (2004–2023) at Center for Advanced Research in Sleep Medicine (Montreal). Participants were followed annually with comprehensive motor and nonmotor assessments until they fulfilled clinical diagnostic criteria for PD, DLB, or MSA ("phenoconversion"). Tracing backward from phenoconversion, clinical trajectories in iRBD were compared with age-expected trajectories, as well as between PD and DLB phenoconverters, using mixed-effects models.

Results

A total of 95 people with iRBD were included in the analysis (69.0 ± 8.5 years, 26% female, RBD duration 7.1 ± 7.4 years, follow-up 1–15 years) and were eventually diagnosed with either PD (n = 46), DLB (n = 43), or MSA (n = 6). Among phenoconverters, Movement Disorders Society-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale Part III and quantitative motor testing showed slowly progressing changes from Y-10, followed by exponential increase approximately 4 years before phenoconversion (F (4,298) = 79.1, p < 0.001). From 4 to 5 years before phenoconversion, accelerated worsening was found in global cognition (F (3,278) = 33.7, p < 0.001) and color vision (F (3,646) = 15.9, p < 0.001). Hyposmia was evident from Y-14 and progressed linearly (F (1,37) = 15.0, p < 0.001). Autonomic manifestations were evident from Y-12. DLB phenoconverters showed faster decline in global cognition (F (3,95) = 21.0, p < 0.001) and color vision (F (3,235) = 3.5, p = 0.02) than PD phenoconverters.

Discussion

Participants with iRBD showed evolving motor and nonmotor impairment many years before diagnosis of manifest synucleinopathy compared with estimated age-expected references. Our results suggest that some clinical features emerge early and progress linearly while others develop gradually and progress more rapidly shortly before phenoconversion. Prodromal PD, MSA, and DLB phenoconverters showed overlapping but distinct clinical trajectories, mainly for motor testing, cognitive function, and color vision. Additional large multicenter studies including longitudinal follow-up of controls are needed.

### REM sleep behavior disorder and its possible prodromes in general population: prevalence, polysomnography findings, and associated factors [^16195c8d]. Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is a parasomnia characterized by repeated dream enactment behavior (DEB) associated with loss of muscle atonia during REM.RBD is regarded as a prodromal stage for major neurodegenerative diseases, particularly α-synucleinopathies such as Parkinson disease (PD), dementia with Lewy body, and multiple system atrophy. A large-sized international cohort reported a 73.5% phenoconversion rate of idiopathic RBD to neurodegenerative diseases after the 12-year follow-up. Given that early diagnosis is fundamental for effective management of neurodegenerative diseases, detection or surveillance of RBD at the level of the general population might provide a key for improving the outcomes of these diseases.

The prevalence of polysomnography (PSG)–confirmed RBD is suggested at 1.18%–1.34%, based on recent population-based studies. The spectrum of RBD is expanding, and the concept of a prodromal state of RBD has been investigated by diverse definitions and terminology. Among them, the prodromal state of RBD can be categorized into 2 groups: isolated REM without atonia (RWA), which refers to the condition with RWA values that meet the criteria for RBD diagnosis but without relevant history of DEB, and isolated DEB, the condition with repeated DEB but with subthreshold RWA values. Extensive discussion has targeted the concept and definition of the prodromal state of RBD, and the International RBD Study group has provided a comprehensive guideline for proper identification and investigative methods for the prodromal state of RBD.

A recent study reported that prodromal RBD, defined by the presence of DEB in the clinical history with subthreshold RWA on PSG, is associated with a 66% phenoconversion rate to full-blown RBD after 8.2 years and a 2.95 times increased risk of developing neurodegenerative disorders. Because the diagnosis of RBD and prodromal RBD requires a clinically relevant history of DEB and RWA measurement on PSG, the prevalence and clinical features of both conditions have not yet been simultaneously established in the general population, and a substantial portion of patients might remain unrecognized. In addition, the efficacy of screening tools of RBD, such as the RBD screening questionnaire (RBDSQ), has not been fully established in the general population, and the correlation of the RWA parameters with the phenotypic severity of RBD has not been investigated.

### Diagnosis and management of dementia with lewy bodies: fourth consensus report of the DLB consortium [^f8428cae]. Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

REM sleep behavior disorder.

RBD is a parasomnia manifested by recurrent dream enactment behavior that includes movements mimicking dream content and associated with an absence of normal REM sleep atonia. It is particularly likely if dreams involve a chasing or attacking theme, and if the patient or bed partner has sustained injuries from limb movements.e10 RBD is now included as a core clinical feature because it occurs frequently in autopsy-confirmed cases compared with non-DLB (76% vs 4%). It often begins many years before other symptoms, may become less vigorous or even quiescent over time, and should be screened for using a scale that allows for patient or bed partner report. Conditions mimicking RBD are common in people with dementia, e.g. confusional awakenings, severe obstructive sleep apnea, and periodic limb movements, all of which must be excluded by careful supplementary questioning to avoid a false-positive diagnosis. If there is any doubt whether a sleep disturbance is due to RBD, referral to a specialist sleep clinic should be made, or polysomnography (PSG) requested.

Supportive clinical features.

These are clinical features that are commonly present, sometimes early. Although lacking diagnostic specificity, such symptoms may indicate DLB in a patient with dementia, particularly when they persist over time or if several occur in combination. New to this list is hypersomnia, usually presenting as excessive daytime sleepiness. Also new is hyposmia, which occurs earlier in DLB than in AD. Transient episodes of unresponsiveness may represent an extreme form of cognitive fluctuation, difficult to distinguish from true syncope. Severe antipsychotic sensitivity is now listed as supportive, because reduced prescribing of D2 receptor blocking antipsychotics in DLB limits its diagnostic usefulness. e11 Caution about their use remains unchanged.

Biomarkers.

Although direct biomarker evidence of LB-related pathology is not yet available for clinical diagnosis, several useful indirect methods are.

Indicative biomarkers.

If one or more of these is found, associated with one or more core clinical features, probable DLB should be diagnosed. Dementia without any core clinical features, but with one or more indicative biomarkers, may be classified as possible DLB. Probable DLB should not be diagnosed on the basis of biomarkers alone.

### Clinical characteristics and phenoconversion in isolated REM sleep behavior disorder: a prospective single-center study in Korea, compared with Montreal cohort [^6ccc44d1]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Study Objectives

Isolated rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder is a prodromal synucleinopathy, but its conversion rate and subtypes can vary among different cohorts. We report the clinical characteristics and phenoconversion rate of the large single-center isolated rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder cohort in Korea and compared it to the Montreal cohort.

Methods

This prospective cohort study examined 238 patients with polysomnography confirmed isolated rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder from Seoul National University Hospital (SNUH) who completed at least 1 follow-up evaluation. We compared the baseline and phenoconversion data of the SNUH cohort to those of 242 isolated rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder patients in the Montreal cohort.

Results

In the SNUH cohort, age at rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder diagnosis was similar (66.4 ± 7.8 vs 65.6 ± 8.4, P = 0.265), but the proportion of men was lower (63.0% vs 74.0%, P = 0.01), and the duration of follow-up was shorter than that in the Montreal cohort (3.7 ± 2.0 vs 4.8 ± 3.6 years, P < .001). During follow-up, 34 (11.8%) patients in the SNUH cohort converted to neurodegenerative disease: 18 (52.9%) to Parkinson's disease, 9 (26.5%) to dementia with Lewy bodies, and 7 (20.6%) to multiple system atrophy. The conversion rate in the SNUH cohort was 15% after 3 years, 22% after 5 years, and 32% after 7 years, which was significantly lower than that of the Montreal cohort (log-rank test, P = 0.002). Among phenoconversion subtype, fewer patients in the SNUH group than in the Montreal group converted to dementia with Lewy bodies (Gray's test P = 0.001).

Conclusions

Through a comparative analysis between the SNUH and Montreal cohorts, we identified a significant difference in phenoconversion rates, particularly for dementia with Lewy bodies patients. These findings underscore the importance of further research into the underlying factors, such as racial and geographical factors contributing to such disparities.

### Trauma associated sleep disorder: a parasomnia induced by trauma [^f158083c]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Nightmares and disruptive nocturnal behaviors that develop after traumatic experiences have long been recognized as having different clinical characteristics that overlap with other established parasomnia diagnoses. The inciting experience is typically in the setting of extreme traumatic stress coupled with periods of sleep disruption and/or deprivation. The limited number of laboratory documented cases and symptomatic overlap with rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have contributed to difficulties in identifying what is a unique parasomnia. Trauma associated sleep disorder (TSD) incorporates the inciting traumatic experience and clinical features of trauma related nightmares and disruptive nocturnal behaviors as a novel parasomnia. The aims of this theoretical review are to 1) summarize the known cases and clinical findings supporting TSD, 2) differentiate TSD from clinical disorders with which it has overlapping features, 3) propose criteria for the diagnosis of TSD, and 4) present a hypothetical neurobiological model for the pathophysiology of TSD. Hyperarousal, as opposed to neurodegenerative changes in RBD, is a component of TSD that likely contributes to overriding atonia during REM sleep and the comorbid diagnosis of insomnia. Lastly, a way forward to further establish TSD as an accepted sleep disorder is proposed.

### Differences in clinical characteristics when REM sleep behavior disorder precedes or comes after the onset of Parkinson's disease [^45b5ecd1]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is important not only as a preclinical symptom of Parkinson's disease (PD), but also as an aggravating symptom of PD. However, it is not known whether the onset of RBD in relation to PD affects the clinical characteristics of PD. A cross-sectional study comparing clinical characteristics of PD between patients with RBD occurring before and after the onset of PD was conducted.

Methods

Interviews regarding RBD symptoms were conducted and polysomnography was performed on 136 patients with PD. Patients with PD were divided into a group with RBD and a group without RBD. Moreover, the group with RBD was subdivided into those with RBD before the onset of PD (RBD→PD) and those with RBD after the onset of PD (PD→RBD). Clinical characteristics of the patients with and without RBD, and PD with RBD→PD and PD→RBD were compared.

Results

Patients with RBD (47 PD patients) had more severe parkinsonian symptoms, autonomic dysfunction, and cognitive impairment than those without RBD (89 PD patients). Moreover, 38 PD patients with PD→RBD had greater cognitive impairment including Mini-metal examination than 9 with RBD→PD in spite of similar motor and autonomic dysfunction with similar dopaminergic agents.

Conclusion

The occurrence of RBD after the onset of PD might be an important factor aggravating cognitive function.

### Rapid-eye-movement sleep behaviour disorder and neurodegenerative diseases [^514bf888]. The Lancet: Neurology (2006). Medium credibility.

Rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep behaviour disorder (RBD) is characterised by loss of muscular atonia and prominent motor behaviours during REM sleep. RBD can cause sleep disruption and severe injuries for the patient or bed partner. The disorder is strongly associated with neurodegenerative diseases, such as multiple-system atrophy, Parkinson's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, and progressive supranuclear palsy. In many cases, the symptoms of RBD precede other symptoms of these neurodegenerative disorders by several years. Furthermore, several recent studies have shown that RBD is associated with abnormalities of electroencephalographic activity, cerebral blood flow, and cognitive, perceptual, and autonomic functions. RBD might be a stage in the development of neurodegenerative disorders and increased awareness of this could lead to substantial advances in knowledge of mechanisms, diagnosis, and treatment of neurodegenerative disorders.

1 Introduction

REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is a parasomnia characterized by dream‐enacting behaviors and the loss of physiological muscle tone during REM sleep. RBD without overt neurological signs, such as dementia or Parkinsonism, has historically been defined as idiopathic (iRBD). Subsequently, the label "clinically isolated", which would apply to RBD patients who do not have overt motor or cognitive signs or symptoms, has been proposed as a replacement for the term "idiopathic". Nevertheless, at the time of diagnosis, most iRBD patients show mild motor symptoms, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), autonomic and olfaction dysfunctions, and neuroimaging abnormalities (mostly abnormal presynaptic dopaminergic imaging, typically on SPECT, i.e. DaT‐SPECT), which are suggestive of incipient alpha‐synucleinopathy. Indeed, the vast majority of iRBD patients will eventually receive a clinical diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD) or dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and a minority of multiple system atrophy (MSA). Research criteria for prodromal PD (pPD) and prodromal DLB (pDLB) were defined based on the acknowledgment that these disorders have a long prodromal stage before the emergence of overt Parkinsonism and/or dementia. In this context, the presence of polysomnography‐confirmed RBD is among the strongest indicators of both pPD and pDLB. Following this mounting evidence, a new framework on the alpha‐synucleinopathy spectrum is being proposed, suggesting that the prodromal and overt stages should no longer be clearly distinct. According to this framework, the presence of polysomnography‐confirmed RBD is associated with an underlying alpha‐synucleinopathy with the same likelihood of clinical demonstration of overt Parkinsonism, dementia, and neurogenic orthostatic hypotension. Indeed, pathological alpha‐synuclein is found in the cerebrospinal fluid and skin in up to 97% of living people with "idiopathic/isolated" RBD. This finding, along with the concomitant, albeit subtle, signs and/or symptoms likely associated with neurodegeneration found in most iRBD patients, raises the question of whether the labels "idiopathic" and "clinically isolated" remain adequate. As a further complication, RBD may be due to other disorders, such as narcolepsy, autoimmune encephalitis, and brainstem lesions, in a significant proportion of people. Thus, a new lexicon on RBD may be envisioned by switching from a descriptive framework to a more biology‐driven one. Thus, better understanding and characterizing the heterogeneity of people with RBD is essential.

Isolated REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) — definition, course, and addressed agents: Patients with isolated RBD have an emergence of dream enactment, along with a PSG-documented elevation in REM sleep motor tone, in the absence of a clear underlying disorder or inciting substance or medication. Because the natural history of RBD is typically relentless and lifelong, patients with isolated RBD can be expected to require treatment for years to decades. Head-to-head studies comparing their effectiveness have not been performed; and We are making conditional recommendations for the use of 4 agents in the treatment of isolated RBD: clonazepam, immediate-release melatonin, pramipexole, and rivastigmine.

### The clinical and pathophysiological relevance of REM sleep behavior disorder in neurodegenerative diseases [^2831ba2f]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is characterized by vigorous movements associated with unpleasant dreams and increased electromyographic activity during REM sleep. Polysomnography with audiovisual recording is needed to confirm the diagnosis of RBD and to exclude other sleep disorders that can mimic its symptoms including obstructive sleep apnea, nocturnal hallucinations and confusional awakenings. RBD may be idiopathic or related to neurodegenerative diseases, particularly multiple system atrophy, Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies. RBD may be the first manifestation of these disorders, antedating the onset of parkinsonism, cerebellar syndrome, dysautonomia, and dementia by several years. RBD should thus be considered an integral part of the disease process. When effective, neuroprotective strategies should be considered in subjects with idiopathic RBD. Patients with other neurodegenerative diseases, though, such as spinocerebellar ataxias, may also present with RBD. When clinically required, clonazepam at bedtime is effective in decreasing the intensity of dream-enacting behaviors and unpleasant dreams in both the idiopathic and secondary forms. When part of a neurodegenerative disorder the development of RBD is thought to reflect the location and extent of the underlying lesions involving the REM sleep centers of the brain (e.g., locus subceruleus, amygdala, etc.), leading to a complex multiple neurotransmitter dysfunction that involves GABAergic, glutamatergic and monoaminergic systems. RBD is mediated neither by direct abnormal alpha-synuclein inclusions nor by striatonigral dopaminergic deficiency alone.

### Characteristics of idiopathic REM sleep behavior disorder and that associated with MSA and PD [^de35eee3]. Neurology (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare the clinical and video-polysomnographic (VPSG) characteristics of idiopathic REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) vs the RBD seen in multiple system atrophy (MSA) and Parkinson disease (PD).

Methods

Clinical features and VPSG measures were evaluated in 110 consecutive nondemented subjects (26 MSA, 45 PD, and 39 idiopathic RBD) free of psychoactive medications referred for suspected RBD to our sleep unit over a 5-year period, with extended follow-up (mean 26.9 ± 21.3 months).

Results

Across the three groups studied, logistic regression analysis demonstrated that there were no differences in the quality of RBD symptoms (e.g., nature of unpleasant dream recall or behaviors witnessed by bed partners), most PSG variables, abnormal behaviors captured by VPSG, and clinical response to clonazepam. When compared to subjects with PD, however, patients with MSA had a significantly shorter duration of disease, a higher REM sleep without atonia percentage, a greater periodic leg movement index, and less total sleep time. Subjects with idiopathic RBD, as compared to those with either MSA or PD, were more often male, had greater self-reported clinical RBD severity, and were more often aware of their abnormal sleep behaviors.

Conclusions

REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD)-related symptoms and neurophysiologic features are qualitatively similar in RBD subjects with the idiopathic form, multiple system atrophy (MSA), and Parkinson disease (PD). Polysomnographic abnormalities associated with RBD in the setting of MSA are greater than in PD, suggesting a more severe dysfunction in the structures that modulate REM sleep.

### Clinical features associated with REM sleep behavior disorder symptoms in the early stages of Parkinson's disease [^f7560bab]. Journal of Neurology (2011). Low credibility.

We aimed to characterize the clinical features associated with REM sleep behaviour disorder (RBD) in early stage Parkinson's disease (PD). Presence of clinical RBD was determined according to ICSD minimal clinical criteria and a validated RBD questionnaire. We registered time of appearance of RBD symptoms in relation to PD onset and the occurrence of RBD symptoms in the past in non-RBD patients. RBD and non-RBD groups were compared in terms of motor and cognitive dysfunction. The same comparisons were made between patients who reported RBD symptoms at some point in time (including those non-RBD patients that reported occurrence of RBD symptoms in the past) and those who did not (RBDS and non-RBDS, respectively). We assessed 75 patients. Forty-one (55%) patients presented with RBD, 19 beginning before PD onset. Five non-RBD patients reported having had RBD symptoms in the past. There were no significant differences between RBD and non-RBD patients. RBDS group presented a significantly higher proportion of non-tremor motor sub-type compared to non-RBDS patients. Our results suggest that RBD is very frequent in the early stages of PD. In some patients, RBD symptoms could have disappeared before or in the first years after motor disturbance onset. Non-tremor motor sub-type was related to RBD symptoms history, rather than to the presence of RBD clinical criteria at time of evaluation, suggesting that the physiopathological changes that cause the association with motor status could remain, in spite of symptom fluctuation.

### REM sleep behavior disorder and its possible prodromes in general population: prevalence, polysomnography findings, and associated factors [^5ff947ef]. Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

In this study, we aimed to address these issues for the proper detection and surveillance of RBD and its possible prodromal conditions in the general population. First, we measured the prevalence of RBD and its possible prodromal conditions (isolated RWA and isolated DEB) in the general population, based on a clinical interview supplemented with an overnight PSG covering the study population. Second, we compared clinical features, DEB severity, and RWA parameters among RBD, isolated RWA, isolated DEB, and no RBD groups and suggest the diagnostic threshold of RWA parameters or RBDSQ to differentiate RBD spectrum conditions. Third, we evaluated the association between RWA parameters and the frequency of DEB.

### The many faces of REM sleep behavior disorder. providing evidence for a new lexicon [^8974ec6d]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Based on this evidence, we suggest launching an international initiative involving the International RBD Study Group (IRBDSG), international neurological and sleep societies, and relevant stakeholders to define a new lexicon for people with a polysomnography‐confirmed diagnosis of RBD, incorporating relevant biomarkers to clearly define the underlying etiologies of the disease. This initiative may allow us to clearly differentiate RBD due to alpha‐synucleinopathy from RBD due to other etiologies, such as narcolepsy and brainstem lesions, by identifying the biomarkers that should be used, as well as their manner and timing of use. Moreover, a new lexicon may more explicitly identify people with an underlying neurodegenerative disorder, with relevant implications for the enrollment criteria in trials with disease‐modifying drugs, by clearly defining the target population. Indeed, polysomnography‐proven RBD due to alpha‐synucleinopathy is currently considered the best target for future disease‐modifying clinical trials.

Sleepiness — future research priorities state that sleepiness has been and must continue to be a primary outcome measure in clinical trials of sleep–wake disorder treatments, that research needs to be conducted in diverse populations, and that it is necessary to develop objectively measured and reliable biomarkers of excessive sleepiness including blood biomarkers, other physiologic markers, and metrics derived from electroencephalogram recordings; deep phenotyping of clinical data including polysomnographic variables holds promise for patient-centered care pathways, there remains a need for large prospective studies to define causal mechanisms and predictive baseline characteristics of residual sleepiness, improved pharmacologic options are needed alongside identification of genetic variations affecting therapeutic actions and adverse effects, research needs to bridge measurable characteristics and pathophysiological traits to enable tailored therapies targeting specific endotypes, and more research is needed to understand how sleepiness impairs daytime functioning and quality of life.

### REM sleep behaviour disorder [^d7167206]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2018). Medium credibility.

Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behaviour disorder (RBD) is a parasomnia that is characterized by loss of muscle atonia during REM sleep (known as REM sleep without atonia, or RSWA) and abnormal behaviours occurring during REM sleep, often as dream enactments that can cause injury. RBD is categorized as either idiopathic RBD or symptomatic (also known as secondary) RBD; the latter is associated with antidepressant use or with neurological diseases, especially α-synucleinopathies (such as Parkinson disease, dementia with Lewy bodies and multiple system atrophy) but also narcolepsy type 1. A clinical history of dream enactment or complex motor behaviours together with the presence of muscle activity during REM sleep confirmed by video polysomnography are mandatory for a definite RBD diagnosis. Management involves clonazepam and/or melatonin and counselling and aims to suppress unpleasant dreams and behaviours and improve bedpartner quality of life. RSWA and RBD are now recognized as manifestations of an α-synucleinopathy; most older adults with idiopathic RBD will eventually develop an overt neurodegenerative syndrome. In the future, studies will likely evaluate neuroprotective therapies in patients with idiopathic RBD to prevent or delay α-synucleinopathy-related motor and cognitive decline.

### The many faces of REM sleep behavior disorder. providing evidence for a new lexicon [^d1b3acf0]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, the results of this study show the large heterogeneity of people suffering from iRBD, highlighting the relevant outcome implications of the presence of clinical and neuroimaging features in this population. As the availability of both pathological (i.e. alpha synuclein) and downstream neurodegeneration (e.g. nigrostriatal damage) biomarkers is increasing, the labels of 'idiopathic' and 'clinically isolated' RBD now seem outdated; thus, we envision an international initiative to define a biomarker‐based, biology‐driven lexicon to clearly identify the underlying etiologies of RBD. Indeed, the current terminology includes, under a wide umbrella term of idiopathic/clinically isolated RBD, all patients with RBD without overt neurology signs or symptoms (i.e. Parkinsonism or dementia). However, most of these patients (if not all) already have an incipient alpha‐synucleinopathy, and they will soon develop overt Parkinsonism or dementia. Moreover, most patients (at least 70% in our sample) are not clinically isolated, but rather exhibit several other signs and symptoms likely related to an incipient alpha‐synucleinopathy. Thus, the current terminology should be revised to better reflect the clinical and biological picture of RBD patients. Moreover, it is known that the use of biomarkers improves the ability in identifying RBD patients at high risk of phenoconversion. These biomarkers include clinical assessment (such as motor, cognitive, olfaction, and autonomic assessment), as well as imaging techniques (such as DaT‐SPECT, but likely alpha‐synuclein assays in the skin or CSF will definitely be useful). Therefore, in our view, the new lexicon should incorporate the use of biomarkers. However, to better detail which biomarkers should be used, and the exact new lexicon is beyond the aim of the present study, which is intended to suggest launching a joint international societies initiative to clearly define a new and shared terminology to better define patients with RBD.

### Management of REM sleep behavior disorder: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline [^458a25bc]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

This guideline establishes clinical practice recommendations for the management of rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD) in adults.

Methods

The American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) commissioned a task force of experts in sleep medicine to develop recommendations and assign strengths based on a systematic review of the literature and an assessment of the evidence using Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation methodology. The task force provided a summary of the relevant literature and the certainty of evidence, the balance of benefits and harms, patient values and preferences, and resource use considerations that support the recommendations. The AASM Board of Directors approved the final recommendations.

Good Practice Statement

The following good practice statement is based on expert consensus, and its implementation is necessary for the appropriate and effective management of patients with RBD: It is critically important to help patients maintain a safe sleeping environment to prevent potentially injurious nocturnal behaviors. In particular, the removal of bedside weapons, or objects that could inflict injury if thrown or wielded against a bed partner, is of paramount importance. Sharp furniture like nightstands should be moved away or their edges and headboard should be padded. To reduce the risk of injurious falls, a soft carpet, rug, or mat should be placed next to the bed. Patients with severe, uncontrolled RBD should be recommended to sleep separately from their partners, or at the minimum, to place a pillow between themselves and their partners.

Recommendations

The following recommendations, with medications listed in alphabetical order, are a guide for clinicians in choosing a specific treatment for RBD in adults. Each recommendation statement is assigned a strength ("strong" or "conditional"). A "strong" recommendation (ie, "We recommend… ") is one that clinicians should follow under most circumstances. A "conditional" recommendation (ie, "We suggest… ") is one that requires that the clinician use clinical knowledge and experience and strongly consider the patient's values and preferences to determine the best course of action.

ABSTRACT

Background

People with idiopathic/isolated REM sleep behavior disorder (iRBD) are highly heterogeneous, showing mild motor, cognitive, and dysautonomia symptoms. The aim of this study is to unveil the clinical heterogeneity of iRBD with a specific reference to overlapping features with prodromal Parkinson's disease (pPD) and prodromal dementia with Lewy bodies (pDLB) labels.

Methods

People with a polysomnography‐confirmed diagnosis of iRBD were enrolled and followed over time. At baseline, pPD and pDLB criteria were assessed.

Results

Among the 285 iRBD people (68.2 ± 7.6 years, 81% males), due to additional signs or symptoms, 49.8% fulfilled pPD criteria only, 5.6% pDLB criteria only, and 14.4% subjects fulfilled both pPD and pDLB criteria. Conversely, about one third of iRBD people (30.2%) did not meet either pPD or pDLB criteria. At follow‐up (40.6 ± 43.6 months), 28.8% subjects phenoconverted, developing PD (56.1%), DLB (39%), or multiple system atrophy (4.9%). Subjects with iRBD fulfilling either pPD or pDLB criteria, or both, have an increased risk of phenoconversion (adjusted hazard ratio, aHR 2.34, 95% confidence interval, CI 1.24–4.41). On the opposite, subjects not fulfilling prodromal criteria have a significantly reduced short‐term phenoconversion likelihood (aHR 0.43, 95% CI 0.23–0.81). Notably, pPD and pDLB criteria did not predict PD and DLB diagnoses, respectively.

Conclusions

People with iRBD are highly heterogeneous, and the presence of other concomitant signs and symptoms is frequent, leading to faster phenoconversion. Thus, the terms idiopathic and isolated may be poorly appropriate and possibly even confounding. These results pave the way to a more appropriate new lexicon for people with RBD.

### NREM sleep parasomnias as disorders of sleep-state dissociation [^7babbc1d]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2018). Medium credibility.

Non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep parasomnias (or NREM parasomnias) are fascinating disorders with mysterious neurobiological substrates. These conditions are common and often severe, with social, personal and forensic implications. The NREM parasomnias include sleepwalking, sleep terrors and confusional arousals - collectively termed disorders of arousal (DOAs) - as well as less well-known entities such as sleep-related sexual behaviours and eating disorders. Affected patients can exhibit waking behaviours arising abruptly out of NREM sleep. Although the individual remains largely unresponsive to the external environment, their EEG shows both typical sleep-like and wake-like features, and they occasionally report dreaming afterwards. Therefore, these disorders offer a unique natural model to explore the abnormal coexistence of local sleep and wake brain activity and the dissociation between behaviour and various aspects of consciousness. In this article, we critically review major findings and updates on DOAs, focusing on neurophysiological studies, and offer an overview of new clinical frontiers and promising future research areas. We advocate a joint effort to inform clinicians and the general public about the management and follow-up of these conditions. We also strongly encourage collaborative multicentre studies to add more objective polysomnographic criteria to the current official diagnostic definitions and to develop clinical practice guidelines, multidisciplinary research approaches and evidence-based medical care.

Lack of awareness among neurologists and other specialists may also contribute to diagnostic delay, with one study finding that 31% of patients did not receive a timely diagnosis of iRBD (mean delay of 8.7 years from symptom onset) due to failure of their specialist (including neurologists) to recognise the symptoms. Further research shows that even patients presenting with sleep concerns are rarely questioned about specific iRBD symptomology, with the majority of iRBD positive PSG's being requested for other reasons, such as suspected sleep breathing disorders or insomnia. These findings reveal the importance of thorough clinical assessment when patients present with iRBD symptomology, as lack of initial recognition can hinder the diagnostic process and reduce opportunities for disease management, especially early ND identification and potential treatment.

### REM sleep behaviour disorder [^a9429485]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2018). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder:

- **Definition**: RBD is a parasomnia characterized by the loss of normal skeletal muscle atonia during REM sleep, leading to enactment of dreams, often resulting in violent or injurious behaviors.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of RBD is thought to involve dysfunction of the brainstem circuits responsible for maintaining normal REM sleep atonia and suppressing behaviors during REM sleep, particularly the sublaterodorsal nucleus and the magnocellular nucleus of the medulla. This dysfunction may be due to neurodegenerative processes, such as Parkinson's disease, Lewy body dementia, multiple system atrophy.
- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of RBD in the general population is estimated at 0.5%, with a higher prevalence of 2–7% in the elderly, depending on the diagnostic tool used.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for RBD include male gender, age > 50 years, and the presence of neurodegenerative diseases, particularly Parkinson's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, and multiple system atrophy. Other risk factors include antidepressant use and a history of traumatic brain injury.
- **Disease course**: Clinically, RBD typically presents with dream-enacting behaviors such as talking, shouting, punching, kicking, biting, or jumping out of bed, which can lead to injury. Non-violent behaviors may include laughing, gesturing, crying, and singing. These behaviors often gradually increase in frequency and intensity over time.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Idiopathic RBD has a high likelihood of progressing to a neurodegenerative disorder, most commonly one of the synucleinopathies, such as Parkinson's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, or multiple system atrophy. Probable RBD carries a 2.2-fold increased risk of developing MCI or Parkinson's disease over 4 years.

### REM sleep behaviour disorder is associated with worse quality of life and other non-motor features in early Parkinson's disease [^efcd7280]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Findings from early PD in the Discovery cohort confirm that RBD is common throughout its natural history, consistent with neuropathological staging. Patients with early PD and concomitant pRBD have a different phenotype with greater prevalence of some non-motor features. At this stage, we cannot speculate on their rate of motor progression compared to non-pRBD patients. Further follow-up will enable us to explore whether pRBD should be routinely collected as a potential biomarker for clinical progression in PD.

### Trauma associated sleep disorder: clinical developments 5 Years after discovery [^8ebaf23a]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

We review recent and growing evidence that provides support for a novel parasomnia, trauma associated sleep disorder (TASD). Based on these findings, we further develop the clinical and polysomnographic (PSG) characteristics of TASD. We also address factors that precipitate TASD, develop a differential diagnosis, discuss therapy, and propose future directions for research.

Recent Findings

Nightmares, classically a REM phenomenon, are prevalent and underreported, even in individuals with trauma exposure. When specifically queried, trauma-related nightmares (TRN) are frequently associated with disruptive nocturnal behaviors (DNB), consistent with TASD. Capture of DNB in the lab is rare but ambulatory monitoring reveals dynamic autonomic concomitants associated with disturbed dreaming. TRN may be reported in NREM as well as REM sleep, though associated respiratory events may confound this finding. Further, dream content is more distressing in REM. Therapy for this complex disorder likely requires addressing not only the specific TASD components of TRN and DNB but comorbid sleep disorders. TASD is a unique parasomnia developing after trauma. Trauma-exposed individuals should be specifically asked about their sleep and if they have nightmares with or without DNB. Patients who report TRN warrant in-lab PSG as part of their evaluation.

### Diagnostic tools for REM sleep behavior disorder [^41df1c13]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is a parasomnia characterized by loss of muscle atonia during REM sleep that results in motor behaviors. Diagnosis of RBD involves a clinical interview in which history of dream enactment behaviors is elicited and a subsequent overnight polysomnography (PSG) evaluation to assess for REM sleep without atonia (RWA) and/or observe motor behaviors during REM sleep. Therefore, the nature of RBD diagnosis involves both subjective and objective measurements that attempt to qualify and quantify the different diagnostic sub-criteria.

Objectives

The primary aim of the current study was to identify and summarize the available clinical measurements that have been used for RBD assessment.

Methods

Two major online databases (MEDLINE and PsycInfo) were searched for articles developing, validating, or evaluating psychometric properties of the RBD diagnostic criteria or methods used for diagnosis. Studies of adult subjects (18 years or more) that included sufficient psychometric data for validation were included.

Results

Fifty-eight studies were found to meet review criteria. The objective measurements for assessment of RBD reviewed included visual electromyographic (EMG) scoring methods, computerized EMG scoring methods, cardiac (123)I-metaiodobenzylguanidine ((123)I-MIBG) scintigraphy, actigraphy, behavioral classification and video analysis. Subjective measurements of RBD included interviews and questionnaires.

Conclusion

Sleep history may be sufficient for diagnosis of RBD in some populations. However, PSG is necessary for a definitive diagnosis. EMG scoring methods vary in definition used and there is no single accepted approach to scoring muscle activity. Additional validation studies are required for establishing cutoff scores for the different methods. Questionnaires were shown to be appropriate screening tools, yet further validation in different populations is necessary.

### Isolated REM sleep behaviour disorder: current diagnostic procedures and emerging new technologies [^3cad0401]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

The International Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD-3) states the following diagnostic criteria for REM sleep behaviour disorder (RBD):

" Repeated episodes of sleep-related vocalization and/or complex motor behaviours; these behaviours are documented by polysomnography (PSG) to occur during REM sleep or based on clinical history of dream enactment, are presumed to occur during REM sleep; PSG recording demonstrates REM sleep without atonia (RSWA); and the disturbance is not better explained by another sleep disorder, mental disorder, medication or substance abuse "

American Academy of Sleep Medicine (2014) International classification of sleep disorders, 3rd edn. American Academy of Sleep Medicine, Darien

The International RBD Study Group (IRBDSG) also recently published definitive guidelines for RBD diagnosis stating that video PSG (vPSG) is mandatory for the identification of iRBD, and must find either isolated RSWA or motor events (i.e. any type of movement in sleep captured on video). Thus, for a confirmed diagnosis of iRBD, a documented history of dream enactment behaviour, along with a full vPSG to obtain evidence of RSWA or motor events during sleep is required. This is problematic for many, if not most, clinicians as unfortunately, access to vPSG is limited due to expense and/or is unavailable in many locations throughout the world. Availability of sleep specialists and overnight bed use in hospitals is low world-wide, and costs to patients and/or healthcare systems tend to be excessive, causing high discrepancy between capacity and demand. In lieu of a vPSG, several non-diagnostic iRBD screening questionnaires are used, which show varying rates of reliability and validity, and depend strongly on a person's awareness of their symptoms. More recently, new and wearable technology (such as the actigraphy watch) has been developed, which may improve diagnostic accessibility and lower the cost of sleep investigations. An extensive literature search for this narrative review was conducted between October and December 2021, with a focus on papers published from 2011 to 2021. Databases searched included Scopus, Web of Science and PubMed, with numerous search terms, such as "REM sleep behaviour disorder", "diagnosis", "diagnostic procedures", "screening questionnaires", "clinical interview", "actigraphy", and "technology". The aim of this review is to support clinicians in making a diagnosis of iRBD by outlining the tools currently available in the diagnosis of iRBD, the efficacy of each, and a potential way forward using new technologies for easier access to diagnosis.

### Genome-wide association study of REM sleep behavior disorder in Parkinson's disease [^d5105812]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is a parasomnia characterized by the absence of muscle atonia during REM sleep and dreams enactment. When no neurological conditions or other concomitant factors are identified, it is referred to as isolated/idiopathic RBD (iRBD). iRBD is typically considered a prodromal stage of synucleinopathies, as about 80%–90% of the cases convert to either Parkinson's disease (PD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) or, more rarely, multiple system atrophy (MSA). These disorders are all characterized by the accumulation of alpha-synuclein, encoded by the SNCA gene. RBD is therefore a key prodromal clinical marker of synucleinopathies, and its presence is also associated with a distinctive, more severe clinical presentation. In PD patients with RBD (approximately 25–58% of cases), RBD is associated with a more malignant phenotype, characterized by faster progressionand greater frequency and/or severity of neuropsychiatric manifestations, including cognitive decline, hallucinations, depression, anxiety and apathy –. RBD can occur before (then it will be referred to as iRBD), or after the onset of PD and typically PD + RBD cohorts include similar frequencies of individuals who had RBD before and after the onset of RBD.

### Research criteria for the diagnosis of prodromal dementia with lewy bodies [^3042d4cf]. Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Idiopathic REM sleep behavior disorder

RBD is characterized by abnormal dream enactment behavior during REM sleep, accompanied by loss of muscle atonia during REM sleep (REM sleep without atonia or RSWA) on PSG. For the purpose of a prodromal DLB diagnosis, a clinical history of RBD is obtained in the same way as for DLB, that is, a clear complaint of dream enactment by a bedpartner or other witness, with no evidence of sleep disorders that may mimic RBD on clinical interview. Conditions known to mimic or masquerade as RBD include non-REM parasomnias (sleep walking, sleep talking, or other behaviors that emerge from non-REM sleep stages), obstructive sleep apnea, confusional arousals, or nocturnal seizures. In the absence of PSG, the risk of a false-positive clinical diagnosis of RBD is reduced by using optimized sleep questionnaires, which can have sensitivity and specificity over 90%. e42

RBD may be considered as idiopathic until it is associated with another ongoing neurologic condition, the most frequent being an α-synucleinopathy (PD, DLB, or MSA). In a recent large study, 73.5% of patients with RBD converted to an overt neurodegenerative syndrome after 12-year follow-up, 56.5% developing parkinsonism, and 43.5% dementia as their first disease manifestation. Among many predictive markers tested, only the cognitive variables differed at baseline between those converting to primary dementia vs parkinsonism. Other multicenter studies confirm that the only clinical feature that predicts dementia vs parkinsonism first is neuropsychological performance; those with RBD who exhibit cognitive changes are more likely to evolve first into MCI or DLB.e4 Thus, although RBD may be regarded an early manifestation of α-synucleinopathy, it is not possible to clearly distinguish whether an individual presenting with RBD will develop dementia first, that is, evolve into a primary DLB diagnosis, or parkinsonism first, that is. a primary PD/MSA diagnosis. Any MCI subtype associated with PSG-confirmed RBD is highly likely to represent underlying LB disease. Although idiopathic RBD is a useful model to study the early stages of LB disease progression, it is not necessarily representative of the whole spectrum of patients with PD and DLB, a significant minority of whom do not have RBD.

### Video analysis reveals early signs of bradykinesia in REM sleep behavior disorder and Parkinson's disease [^ed94dd66]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

REM Sleep Behavior Disorder (RBD) is a sleep disorder characterized by the loss of muscle atonia during REM sleep. RBD patients "act out" their dreams during REM sleep. Idiopathic RBD (iRBD) is strongly associated with an underlying synucleinopathy, and occurs in 40% to 80% of patients clinically diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease (PD). iRBD is the strongest predictor of phenoconversion to PD or other related α- synucleinopathies, i.e. dementia with Lewy bodies, or multiple system atrophy –. Over 80% of clinically proven iRBD patients will phenoconvert at a rate of 6.3% per year. Although less common, iRBD is also found in other proteinopathies such as four-repeat tauopathies, including progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and corticobasal syndrome. Patients with iRBD are good candidates to study neurodegenerative diseases such as PD and related syndromes in the prodromal stage of the disease and to evaluate the effect of early neuroprotective interventions.

Bradykinesia is perhaps the most fundamental and most disabling aspect of PD and related syndromes. Bradykinesia is classically defined as slowness of movement and decrement in amplitude or speed during repetitive movements. However, the term bradykinesia is often used to also indicate low amplitude of movement or the inability to perform a voluntary movement. Currently, the bradykinesia complex is defined as slowness of movement that may be accompanied by other motor features. These motor features including hypokinesia (low amplitude of movement), the sequence effect (decrement in amplitude or speed during repetitive movements), hesitations or halts (irregularities in movement timing), and akinesia (the inability to initiate movement).

Persons with PD typically demonstrate slow movements, low amplitude of movements, and a decrement in amplitude or speed during repetitive movements in the pre-clinical stage of the disease and these symptoms deteriorate as the disease progresses. In contrast, other motor syndromes may exhibit different dominant features. For instance, in PSP, hypokinesia may be the primary movement impairment, with minimal amplitude of movements from the beginning of the movement rather than bradykinesia or decrement in amplitude or speed after repetitive movements. Additionally, the decrement in amplitude or speed during repetitive movements has been suggested as a potential marker of incipient parkinsonism in individuals with iRBD. However, it remains unclear whether bradykinesia and hypokinesia are also present in subjects with iRBD.

### Pathophysiology of REM sleep behaviour disorder and relevance to neurodegenerative disease [^4c5f3113]. Brain (2007). Low credibility.

REM sleep behaviour disorder (RBD) is a parasomnia characterized by the loss of normal skeletal muscle atonia during REM sleep with prominent motor activity accompanying dreaming. The terminology relating to RBD, and mechanisms underlying REM sleep without atonia and RBD based on data in cat and rat are presented. Neuroimaging data from the few published human cases with RBD associated with structural lesions in the brainstem are presented, in which the dorsal midbrain and pons are implicated. Pharmacological manipulations which alter RBD frequency and severity are reviewed, and the data from human neuropathological studies are presented. An anatomic framework and new schema for the pathophysiology of RBD are proposed based on recent data in rat regarding the putative flip-flop switch for REM sleep control. The structure in man analogous to the subcoeruleus region in cat and sublaterodorsal nucleus in rat is proposed as the nucleus (and its associated efferent and afferent pathways) crucial to RBD pathophysiology. The association of RBD with neurological disease ('secondary RBD') is presented, with emphasis on RBD associated with neurodegenerative disease, particularly the synucleinopathies. The hypothesized pathophysiology of RBD is presented in relation to the Braak staging system for Parkinson's disease, in which the topography and temporal sequence of synuclein pathology in the brain could explain the evolution of parkinsonism and/or dementia well after the onset of RBD. These data suggest that many patients with 'idiopathic' RBD are actually exhibiting an early clinical manifestation of an evolving neurodegenerative disorder. Such patients may be appropriate for future drug therapies that affect synuclein pathophysiology, in which the development of parkinsonism and/or dementia could be delayed or prevented. We suggest that additional clinicopathological studies be performed in patients with dementia or parkinsonism, with and without RBD, as well as in patients with idiopathic RBD, to further elucidate the pathophysiology and also characterize the clinical and pathophysiological relevance of RBD in neurodegenerative disease. Furthermore, longitudinal studies in patients with idiopathic RBD are warranted to characterize the natural history of such patients and prepare for future therapeutic trials.

### Biomarkers of neurodegeneration in isolated and antidepressant-related rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder [^9897033c]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Isolated rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (iRBD) is considered a prodromal stage of neurodegenerative disease with underlying synucleinopathy, and may present biomarkers of neurodegeneration, predicting phenoconversion.

In some cases, RBD and its neurophysiological fingerprint REM sleep without atonia (RSWA) appear to be triggered by medications, especially antidepressants. It remains unclear whether antidepressants may cause iatrogenic RBD unrelated to neurodegeneration or reveal a subclinical degenerative iRBD earlier than would otherwise have occurred within the natural evolution of synucleinopathy.

Besides the temporal link between antidepressant initiation and RBD onset, there are no clear characteristics differentiating patients with iRBD from pharmacologically induced RBD (pRBD). The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical, neurophysiological and neuropathological differential features of antidepressant‐related RBD compared to iRBD.

### Sleep disorders in lewy body dementia: mechanisms, clinical relevance, and unanswered questions [^34d80785]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2023). Medium credibility.

In Lewy body dementia (LBD), disturbances of sleep and/or arousal including insomnia, excessive daytime sleepiness, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder, obstructive sleep apnea, and restless leg syndrome are common. These disorders can each exert a significant negative impact on both patient and caregiver quality of life; however, their etiology is poorly understood. Little guidance is available for assessing and managing sleep disorders in LBD, and they remain under-diagnosed and under-treated. This review aims to (1) describe the specific sleep disorders which occur in LBD, considering their putative or potential mechanisms; (2) describe the history and diagnostic process for these disorders in LBD; and (3) summarize current evidence for their management in LBD and consider some of the ongoing and unanswered questions in this field and future research directions.

### Management of REM sleep behavior disorder: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline [^49f406f4]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2023). High credibility.

American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) clinical practice guideline — drug-induced RBD in adults: The AASM suggests that clinicians use drug discontinuation (vs drug continuation) for the treatment of drug-induced RBD in adults. (CONDITIONAL). Remarks: Careful consideration should be given to the severity of comorbid conditions for which the inciting drug is taken and the consequences of eliminating treatment before drug discontinuation for drug-induced RBD in adults. The TF identified 5 observational studies showing clinically significant improvements in RBD symptoms with drug discontinuation and no comorbid disorders reported to have worsened, with overall certainty very low due to imprecision and risk of bias from observational studies. The TF determined that harmful effects of discontinuation may vary and concluded that the balance of effects, resource use, and patient willingness to discontinue may vary depending on the medication, patient population, and clinical scenario.

### International classification of sleep disorders-third edition: highlights and modifications [^6223eaef]. Chest (2014). Low credibility.

The recently released third edition of the International Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD) is a fully revised version of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine's manual of sleep disorders nosology, published in cooperation with international sleep societies. It is the key reference work for the diagnosis of sleep disorders. The ICSD-3 is built on the same basic outline as the ICSD-2, identifying seven major categories that include insomnia disorders, sleep-related breathing disorders, central disorders of hypersomnolence, circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders, sleep-related movement disorders, parasomnias, and other sleep disorders. Significant modifications have been made to the nosology of insomnia, narcolepsy, and parasomnias. Major features and changes of the manual are reviewed in this article. The rationales for these changes are also discussed.

### Rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder in children and adolescents [^0b65056d]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behaviour disorder (RBD) is a recently described parasomnia with important implications for diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis. Once thought to occur only in elderly males, it has now been reported in other groups including children and adolescents. The cardinal feature of RBD is the loss of REM atonia, which allows dreams to be acted out. Depending on the dream content, the accompanying behaviour can be dramatic, sometimes causing self-injury or harm to others. In adults, increasing numbers of associated conditions have been reported, notably neurodegenerative disorders of which RBD can be a prodrome. Other associations include narcolepsy, epilepsy, and antidepressant medications. Awareness that RBD can occur in young patients (admittedly rarely, it seems) is important. It is essential to distinguish between RBD and other dramatic parasomnias because each has different implications and treatment requirements. Children and adolescents displaying both clinical and polysomnographic features of RBD, and others with only polysomnographic evidence of loss of REM atonia, have been reported in association with various neurological and neurodevelopmental disorders. Reports of these cases are reviewed, together with suggestions for further reporting and research.

### Artificial intelligence in sleep medicine: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine position statement [^754ffa45]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Artificial intelligence in sleep medicine — future directions emphasize that "The future applications of AI in clinical sleep medicine are expected to transcend PSG scoring". The page notes that "ML techniques have been developed that appear to allow accurate assisted identification of narcolepsy", and that integrating PSG with clinical, genomic, behavioral, and other data "may help to improve the diagnosis and classification of disease, identify sub- and endophenotypes, and, ultimately, develop precision interventions". Potential applications "include improved prediction of cardiovascular risk based on identification of specific OSA phenotypes", "delineation of pathophysiological mechanisms underlying OSA to guide patient-specific treatment selection", and "use of electroencephalogram characteristics to predict conversion from idiopathic REM sleep behavior disorder to neurodegenerative disease". In addition, "AI, in conjunction with ubiquitous mobile devices, can identify PAP adherence and mask fit difficulties, triggering self-management interventions that may empower patients to optimize treatment adherence".

### The many faces of REM sleep behavior disorder. providing evidence for a new lexicon [^18d8a178]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

This approach has already been applied in the Alzheimer's disease (AD) field, where the prodromal (i.e. predementia) AD stage is known to be characterized by the presence of MCI. In 2011, the National Institute on Aging‐Alzheimer's Association (NIA‐AA) workgroups on diagnostic guidelines for AD suggested that when a clinical diagnosis of MCI is made, biomarkers should be used to establish the underlying etiology responsible for the clinical deficit. This finding was recognized as extremely important because MCI may be due to several underlying etiologies, including but not limited to AD. Similarly, RBD is a clinical diagnosis but has a multitude of underlying etiologies, including alpha‐synucleinopathy, but also narcolepsy and brainstem lesions.

The present study revealed that approximately 30% of the enrolled subjects were affected by RBD due to alpha‐synucleinopathy because of the development of overt PD, DLB or MSA at follow‐up. However, approximately 70% of the enrolled subjects presented with a multitude of subtle yet detectable signs and symptoms that allowed them to be diagnosed with prodromal PD and/or DLB. This finding is in line with literature data obtained from large multicentric iRBD cohorts showing that in up to 73% of iRBD patients, RBD is due to alpha‐synucleinopathy because of the phenoconversion to overt PD, DLB or MSA over time, when an adequately long follow‐up is available. Notably, more than 95% of iRBD patients have a positive alpha‐synuclein biomarker. Overall, these findings further stress that both "idiopathic" and "clinically isolated" terms are likely no longer adequate and possibly even misleading for the majority of people currently labeled as iRBD.

### A critical review of the pharmacological treatment of REM sleep behavior disorder in adults: time for more and larger randomized placebo-controlled trials [^10906f04]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Rapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is a parasomnia, in which a loss of physiological muscle atonia during REM sleep leads to dream enactment behaviors (DEB). A clinical history of DEB together with video-polysomnography (PSG) confirmed REM sleep without atonia (RWA), or a combination of RWA and dream-enactment behaviors documented with PSG, are mandatory for a clinical diagnosis of RBD according to the International Classification of Sleep Disorders-III. Although RBD symptoms can be seen in several disorders, such as narcolepsy-cataplexy and parasomnia overlap disorder, and may be precipitated by certain drugs, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, its isolated presence in the general adult population is closely linked with alpha synuclein neuropathology and a future diagnosis of either Parkinson's Disease (PD), Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB) or Multiple System Atrophy (MSA). In the general population around 1% of people have clinically isolated RBD, whereas the proportion is much higher in PD (20–50%) and over 80% of DLB and MSA patients report RBD. People with severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) frequently experience OSA-induced arousals that may result in movements during REM sleep mimicking RBD symptoms. Importantly, however, people with OSA can indeed have true RBD, which should be confirmed with PSG after treating the OSA.

### REM sleep behaviour disorder is associated with worse quality of life and other non-motor features in early Parkinson's disease [^fdf9afd7]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

REM sleep behaviour disorder (RBD), first described by Schenck and colleagues in 1986, is characterised by the loss of normal muscle atonia during REM sleep. Patients often experience violent dream-enacting behaviours leading to disturbed sleep and potential injuries to themselves and their bed partner. While polysomnography (PSG) remains the diagnostic gold standard, the diagnosis of probable RBD (pRBD) can be made based on clinical judgment or validated questionnaires. Although human pathophysiological data are somewhat limited, our current understanding suggests that it is the loss of nuclei in the tegmentum pontis and the medial medulla oblongata which are responsible for the symptoms of RBD.

Over the past 20 years, a number of key studies have linked the presence of idiopathic RBD with a future increased risk of developing neurodegenerative disease, including parkinsonism and dementia. Recently, Schenck and colleagues reported that over 80% of males aged 50 years and older initially diagnosed with idiopathic RBD developed a neurodegenerative disorder, with the vast majority being diagnosed with Parkinson's disease (PD). These findings question the existence of 'idiopathic' RBD, which more likely represents the early presentation of other neurodegenerative disorders. It is therefore unsurprising that the symptoms of RBD have been reported in up to 60% of patients with PD.

A number of groups have studied the association between RBD and PD phenotypes (reviewed by Arnulf). These suggest that patients with concomitant RBD are more likely to have a non-tremor phenotype, have a poor response to medication and suffer from more non-motor symptoms. However, most of these observations were based on a small number of patients with relatively prolonged disease duration. As brainstem structures responsible for the symptoms of RBD correspond to stage 2 of the Braak pathophysiological classification of PD, we hypothesise that the symptoms of RBD occur early in the natural history and may be associated with a different clinical phenotype. In this study, we have endeavoured to estimate the prevalence and describe the association between pRBD and motor and non-motor features in a large cohort of subjects with early PD.

### Update on the pharmacology of REM sleep behavior disorder [^f702725d]. Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is characterized by complex behavioral manifestations in response to dream content that may cause sleep disruption or injuries to the patient or the bed partner. In this case, the patients need treatment to control their symptoms. Pharmacologic agents have been reported to have positive and negative impacts on REM sleep muscle atonia and the motor behaviors associated with RBD. Clonazepam is efficacious and well tolerated by the majority of patients afflicted by RBD and should be considered as initial treatment. In patients at risk of falls who have cognitive impairment or who have obstructive sleep apneas, melatonin may be a good alternative to clonazepam. Anticholinesterase inhibitors and dopaminergic agents are not of clear benefit. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, serotonergic synaptic reuptake inhibitors, and noradrenergic antagonists can induce or aggravate RBD symptoms and should be avoided in patients with RBD. When these agents are prescribed to patients with neurodegenerative disorders or narcolepsy who are at risk of developing RBD, systematic follow-up may be warranted to detect the emergence of RBD symptoms.

### Prevalence and clinical correlates of sleep disorders in RFC1-spectrum disorders: a cross-sectional study [^6f72ab48]. Movement Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Sleep disturbances in RFC1‐spectrum disorders remain unexplored. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence and characteristics of sleep disorders in patients with RFC1‐spectrum disorders and their impact on quality of life (QoL).

Methods

Patients underwent a comprehensive sleep assessment using validated questionnaires, polysomnography, and QoL evaluation.

Results

Among 16 participants, 15 (94%) had obstructive sleep apnea: severe in four, moderate in nine, and mild in two. Restless legs syndrome affected 12 patients (75%), with moderate‐to‐severe symptoms in 11. Periodic limb movements during sleep exceeded the clinical threshold in 10 patients (63%). Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder was identified in 1 patient. Subjective assessments revealed poor sleep quality in 11 patients (69%) and insomnia in 10 (63%). All patients exhibited reduced QoL. Reduction in slow‐wave sleep and REM sleep are associated with increased clinical severity.

Conclusion

RFC1‐spectrum disorders are associated with a high prevalence of sleep disorders and impaired QoL, highlighting the need for screening. © 2025 The Author(s). Movement Disorders published by Wiley Periodicals LLC on behalf of International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.

### Charting disease trajectories from isolated REM sleep behavior disorder to Parkinson's disease [^15cd481b]. Movement Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Clinical presentation and progression dynamics are variable in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Disease course mapping is an innovative disease modelling technique that summarizes the range of possible disease trajectories and estimates dimensions related to onset, sequence, and speed of progression of disease markers.

Objective

To propose a disease course map for PD and investigate progression profiles in patients with or without rapid eye movement sleep behavioral disorders (RBD).

Methods

Data of 919 PD patients and 88 isolated RBD patients from three independent longitudinal cohorts were analyzed (follow-up duration = 5.1; 95% confidence interval, 1.1–8.1] years). Disease course map was estimated by using eight clinical markers (motor and non-motor symptoms) and four imaging markers (dopaminergic denervation).

Results

PD course map showed that the first changes occurred in the contralateral putamen 13years before diagnosis, followed by changes in motor symptoms, dysautonomia, sleep-all before diagnosis-and finally cognitive decline at the time of diagnosis. The model showed earlier disease onset, earlier non-motor and later motor symptoms, more rapid progression of cognitive decline in PD patients with RBD than PD patients without RBD. This pattern was even more pronounced in patients with isolated RBD with early changes in sleep, followed by cognition and non-motor symptoms and later changes in motor symptoms.

Conclusions

Our findings are consistent with the presence of distinct patterns of progression between patients with and without RBD. Understanding heterogeneity of PD progression is key to decipher the underlying pathophysiology and select homogeneous subgroups of patients for precision medicine. © 2023 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.

### Basic clinical features do not predict dopamine transporter binding in idiopathic REM behavior disorder [^97413de6]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2019). Medium credibility.

REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is strongly associated with development of Parkinson's Disease and other α-synuclein-related disorders. Dopamine transporter (DAT) binding deficit predicts conversion to α-synuclein-related disorders in individuals with RBD. In turn, identifying which individuals with RBD have the highest likelihood of having abnormal DAT binding would be useful. The objective of this analysis was to examine if there are basic clinical predictors of DAT deficit in RBD. Participants referred for inclusion in the RBD cohort of the Parkinson Progression Markers Initiative were included. Assessments at the screening visit including DAT SPECT imaging, physical examination, cognitive function screen, and questionnaire-based non-motor assessment. The group with DAT binding deficit (n = 49) was compared to those without (n = 26). There were no significant differences in demographic or clinical features between the two groups. When recruiting RBD cohorts enriched for high risk of neurodegenerative disorders, our data support the need for objective biomarker assessments.

### Sleep disorders in Parkinson's disease: an overview [^f430a35f]. Movement Disorders (2007). Low credibility.

Sleep disturbances are one of the most common of the nonmotor complications of Parkinson's disease (PD), and increase in frequency with advancing disease. The causes of sleep disturbance in PD are numerous, and many patients may have several factors that contribute. These disorders can be broadly categorized into those that involve nocturnal sleep and daytime manifestations such as excessive daytime sleepiness. Some sleep disorders, in particular REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) and excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) may arise as a primary manifestation of PD, reflecting the anatomic areas affected by the neurodegenerative process. Appropriate diagnosis of the sleep disturbance affecting a PD patient can lead to specific treatments that can consolidate nocturnal sleep and enhance daytime alertness.

Establishing expectations in RBD — education, safety, and monitoring are emphasized: "Patients and bed partners should know that dream enactment is a neurological disorder that can start during any phase of the night. It may occur every night or infrequently", and "Degree of injury, rather than vocalization or intensity of movement, determines the extent of harm". When dream enactment is noninjurious, "escalating pharmacotherapy is usually unwarranted" because more aggressive or sedating therapy "is often futile and dangerous, increasing the risk of nighttime falls and daytime sleepiness". The guideline adds that "ongoing monitoring is crucial to assess the severity of dream enactment and treatment efficacy and to explore whether bed partners should be sleeping separately".

### Familial α-synucleinopathy spectrum features in patients with psychiatric REM sleep behaviour disorder [^199b8b00]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behaviour disorder (RBD) is one of the earliest and most specific prodromes of the α-synucleinopathies including Parkinson's disease (PD). It remains uncertain whether RBD occurring in the context of psychiatric disorders (psy-RBD), although very common, is merely a benign epiphenomenon of antidepressant treatment, or whether it harbours an underlying α-synucleinopathy. We hypothesised that patients with psy-RBD demonstrate a familial predisposition to an α-synucleinopathy.

Methods

In this case-control-family study, a combination of family history and family study method was used to measure the α-synucleinopathy spectrum features, which included RBD, neurodegenerative prodromal markers and clinical diagnoses of neurodegenerative disorders. We compared the risk of α-synucleinopathy spectrum features in the first-degree relatives (FDRs) of patients with psy-RBD, psychiatric controls and healthy controls.

Results

There was an increase of α-synucleinopathy spectrum features in the psy-RBD-FDRs, including possible and provisional RBD (adjusted HR (aHR) = 2.02 and 6.05, respectively), definite RBD (adjusted OR = 11.53) and REM-related phasic electromyographic activities, prodromal markers including depression (aHR = 4.74) and probable subtle parkinsonism, risk of prodromal PD and clinical diagnosis of PD/dementia (aHR = 5.50), as compared with healthy-control-FDRs. When compared with psychiatric-control-FDRs, psy-RBD-FDRs consistently presented with a higher risk for the diagnosis and electromyographic features of RBD, diagnosis of PD/dementia (aHR = 3.91) and risk of prodromal PD. In contrast, psychiatric controls only presented with a familial aggregation of depression.

Conclusion

Patients with psy-RBD are familially predisposed to α-synucleinopathy. The occurrence of RBD with major depression may signify a subtype of major depressive disorders with underlying α-synucleinopathy neurodegeneration.

### A critical review of the pharmacological treatment of REM sleep behavior disorder in adults: time for more and larger randomized placebo-controlled trials [^8a809757]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The best current evidence base for pharmacotherapies for RDB could charitably be described as being of an I-b level (Box 1). Based on lower levels of evidence, the traditionally claimed effectiveness of the two first-line therapies for RBD (melatonin and clonazepam) may be greatly overestimated. The clinically observed effectiveness of these interventions may have been driven by strong placebo effects, regression towards the mean, and the non-specific but laudable effects of good clinical practice in RBD, such as behavioral advice. Concerns continue to exist about the ability of any outcome measure to accurately and objectively capture RBD severity in an unbiased manner. Thus there is a clear need to conduct more robustly designed and adequately powered double-blind placebo-controlled RCTs using better outcome measures on appropriately selected patient groups. Patient-centered diary outcomes are currently recommended for larger phase 3 trials and following validation, objective RBD as measured by home-based PSG over multiple nights is suggested as the most promising primary endpoint for future earlier phase RCTs on RBD.

### Management of REM sleep behavior disorder: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline [^b24cd9b1]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Prognosis and counseling in isolated RBD — risk stratification, disclosure approaches, and resources are detailed: "We believe clinicians should, if the patient desires, tactfully and explicitly discuss the relationship and provide the patient with a customized risk assessment". Chronic alpha-synuclein–linked symptoms coexisting with RBD "are strong predictors of phenoconversion in less than 5 years", whereas their absence with a serotonergic antidepressant "is associated with a lower risk of developing a neurodegenerative disorder in the next 5 years". Pending guidance, the task force presents "2 general approaches… based upon the TF's unanimous consensus: patient-centered risk disclosure and watchful waiting". After diagnosis, "the provider should explore the patient's knowledge about isolated RBD", and "Clinicians should present the literature fairly and in plain language", while offering research connections to groups "such as the North American Prodromal Synucleinopathy consortium", "the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative", and "the International RBD Study Group". The document notes "The watchful waiting approach… may be appropriate… in the setting of severe, active psychiatric illness", and "we suggest the American Academy of Neurology's position statement, 'Ethical Considerations in Dementia Diagnosis and Care'.

### REM sleep behavior disorder: motor manifestations and pathophysiology [^f661bd3f]. Movement Disorders (2012). Low credibility.

Patients with REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) enact violent dreams during REM sleep in the absence of normal muscle atonia. This disorder is highly frequent in patients with synucleinopathies (60%-100% of patients) and rare in patients with other neurodegenerative disorders. The disorder is detected by interview plus video and sleep monitoring. Abnormal movements expose the patients and bed partners to a high risk of injury and sleep disruption. The disorder is usually alleviated with melatonin and clonazepam. Limb movements are mainly minor, jerky, fast, pseudohallucinatory, and repeated, with a limp wrist during apparently grasping movements, although body jerks and complex violent (fights) and nonviolent culturally acquired behaviors are also observed. Notably, parkinsonism disappears during RBD-associated complex behaviors in patients with Parkinson's disease and with multiple system atrophy, suggesting that the upper motor stream bypasses the basal ganglia during REM sleep. Longitudinal studies show that idiopathic RBD predisposes patients to later develop Parkinson's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, and, more rarely, multiple system atrophy, with a rate of conversion of 46% within 5 years. During this time window, patients concomitantly develop nonmotor signs (decreased olfaction and color vision, orthostatic hypotension, altered visuospatial abilities, increased harm avoidance) and have abnormal test results (decreased putamen dopamine uptake, slower EEG). Patients with idiopathic RBD have higher and faster risk for conversion to Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies if abnormalities in dopamine transporter imaging, transcranial sonography, olfaction, and color vision are found at baseline. They constitute a highly specific target for testing neuroprotective agents.

### A critical review of the pharmacological treatment of REM sleep behavior disorder in adults: time for more and larger randomized placebo-controlled trials [^cfefe672]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Despite the widespread use of both clonazepam and melatonin for treating RBD, until recently there was a lack of good quality trial data. Current international guidelines are still based on evidence from mainly small case-series and open-label studies, which are at high risk of bias and have demonstrated inconsistencies in the clinical effectiveness levels reported. In fact, many patients with RBD were considered refractory to these first-line treatment options, which led clinicians to trial a multitude of other pharmacological agents off-label. Past reviews have not consistently accounted for such reports when calculating the number of responders for these commonly prescribed treatments, or were conducted more than 10 years ago. Thus, there is a need to re-assess whether the existing evidence supports the current recommended guidelines for the pharmacological management of RBD.

The purpose of this update is to provide a semi-systematic overview of all clinical and scientific evidence published to date on the pharmacological management of RBD. We focus on the middle- to older (50 years and above) adult population, which has the highest prevalence of RBD as well as being at the greatest risk for adverse outcomes. Doing so, we set out to provide an update on the total number of adults with isolated or secondary RBD who were clinically followed to assess the efficacy of any pharmacological compound given to treat their RBD symptoms. We also assessed the level of evidence based on the study design, as depicted in Box 1. This review specifically investigates the divide between clinical expectancy and the actual evidence for the effectiveness of the common drugs being recommended for managing RBD. We also seek to provide future directions on how this field could move to a more rigorous evidence-base.

### Visual short-term memory deficits in REM sleep behaviour disorder mirror those in Parkinson's disease [^bc6102d9]. Brain (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Prodromal Parkinson's disease — the period between the onset of neurodegeneration and diagnosis — is likely to be the optimal time for introduction of potential curative or disease-modifying treatments. It is associated with several symptoms, including cognitive ones, which might provide a means for early detection of Parkinson's disease. However, because screening for such deficits on a population-wide basis is challenging and unlikely to be a viable strategy, a better understanding of prodromal Parkinson's disease might emerge from targeting 'enriched' at-risk cohorts instead.

One such group is individuals with idiopathic rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behaviour disorder, commonly referred to as RBD. RBD is a parasomnia characterized by motor behaviours associated with vivid dreams during REM sleep. Prospective cohort studies have observed a very strong association between idiopathic RBD and subsequent clinically defined neurodegenerative disease, with up to 80% of cases affected. While some patients develop dementia with Lewy bodies or multiple system atrophy, most eventually develop Parkinson's disease. This high risk of conversion makes patients with RBD ideal candidates for neuroprotective trials against Parkinson's disease.

American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) clinical practice guideline — secondary RBD due to a medical condition in adults, deep brain stimulation (DBS): The AASM suggests that clinicians not use DBS (vs no treatment) for the treatment of secondary RBD due to a medical condition in adults. (CONDITIONAL). Remarks: This recommendation is based solely on the effects of DBS on secondary REM sleep behavior disorder. It does not apply to the use of DBS in the treatment of motor symptoms of PD. The TF identified 4 observational studies showing no clinically significant improvements in RBD symptoms, with overall certainty low due to risk of bias. Reported harms included increased periodic limb movements in 2 patients and other adverse events such as depression, memory impairment, seizures, anxiety, agitation, confusion, dizziness, abnormal movements, pain at implant site, paresthesias, and hardware complications. The TF concluded the risks outweighed benefits and the balance of effects favored no treatment.

### REM sleep behavior disorder in Parkinson's disease and other synucleinopathies [^3fbff5dc]. Movement Disorders (2017). Low credibility.

Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder is characterized by dream enactment and complex motor behaviors during rapid eye movement sleep and rapid eye movement sleep atonia loss (rapid eye movement sleep without atonia) during polysomnography. Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder may be idiopathic or symptomatic and in both settings is highly associated with synucleinopathy neurodegeneration, especially Parkinson's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, multiple system atrophy, and pure autonomic failure. Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder frequently manifests years to decades prior to overt motor, cognitive, or autonomic impairments as the presenting manifestation of synucleinopathy, along with other subtler prodromal "soft" signs of hyposmia, constipation, and orthostatic hypotension. Between 35% and 91.9% of patients initially diagnosed with idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder at a sleep center later develop a defined neurodegenerative disease. Less is known about the long-term prognosis of community-dwelling younger patients, especially women, and rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder associated with antidepressant medications. Patients with rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder are frequently prone to sleep-related injuries and should be treated to prevent injury with either melatonin 3-12mg or clonazepam 0.5–2.0mg to limit injury potential. Further evidence-based studies about rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder are greatly needed, both to enable accurate prognostic prediction of end synucleinopathy phenotypes for individual patients and to support the application of symptomatic and neuroprotective therapies. Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder as a prodromal synucleinopathy represents a defined time point at which neuroprotective therapies could potentially be applied for the prevention of Parkinson's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, multiple system atrophy, and pure autonomic failure. © 2017 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.

### The utility of polysomnography for the diagnosis of NREM parasomnias: an observational study over 4 years of clinical practice [^a97249e2]. Journal of Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Parasomnias are undesirable physical events or experiences that occur during sleep and are classified by the sleep stage from which they arise. NREM parasomnias arise from non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, typically from slow-wave sleep (SWS), and include three typical behaviours–confusional arousals, sleep walking and sleep terrors. They are also termed "arousal disorders" since the episodes usually occur during the transition from SWS to an arousal phase or awakening.

NREM parasomnia typically occurs in childhood although an onset or persistence into adult life is not uncommon. Their diagnosis is essentially clinical and often based on patient and bed-partner interviews. ICSD-2, and recently ICSD-3, propose essential diagnostic criteria for each of the three subtypes above.

Typical NREM parasomnia is usually considered a benign condition, easy to recognise and treat. However, NREM parasomnia diagnosis can be challenging when the clinical history is unusual because of the age of onset, the time or duration of the episodes at night, the presence of suspected precipitating factors (such as periodic limb movements-PLMS or obstructive respiratory events), the unresponsiveness to conventional therapy or the occurrence of complex or dangerous behaviours. Indeed, on occasion, NREM parasomnia can be dangerous, resulting in injurious accidents or, not infrequently, can lead to sleep disruption.

Clinical diagnosis may be especially challenging when there are similarities to other paroxysmal nocturnal events such as REM parasomnia or epilepsy, in particular in those patients in whom multiple conditions coexist.

During the last two decades increasing attention has been placed on clinical methods to distinguish nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy from parasomnia, but, so far, no clinical algorithm or clinical questionnaire has been shown to differentiate reliably between these two different groups of sleep disorders. Therefore overnight video-polysomnography (PSG) is still considered the gold standard test.

According to the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM), PSG can provide support for the clinical diagnosis of NREM parasomnia by documenting multiple arousals from SWS unaccompanied by parasomnia behaviours or strong support by documenting arousals from SWS accompanied by behaviours typical of arousal disorders.

Although PSG is often used to assist the clinician in the diagnosis of NREM parasomnia, the diagnostic value of the test has not been clearly established; there have only been a few studies and some did not differentiate between parasomnia type.

### The many faces of REM sleep behavior disorder. providing evidence for a new lexicon [^9dbfa593]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

In the sample examined in this study, several features, such as hyposmia, as well as a pPD diagnosis, were less common than in recent multicentric studies. This difference may be related to the lower phenoconversion rate in our study (approximately 30%) than in published studies (up to 73%), indicating that our sample likely included a greater percentage of subjects in earlier stages.

Notably, approximately 16% of the iRBD patients enrolled in the present study were admitted to a neurology clinic not complaining of dream‐enacting behaviors but other neurological symptoms, including motor and cognitive impairment, and were then referred to the sleep lab when suspected RBD emerged during the consultation. Thus, if the neurologist would not have questioned about sleep, RBD may have remained undiagnosed. This finding further highlights the importance of specific sleep medicine training for neurologists.

Taken together, these findings suggest that the terms "idiopathic" and "clinically isolated" no longer seem adequate, at least for most people with iRBD. The term "idiopathic" is likely the most outdated because it implies that the underlying cause of the disease is unknown, whereas most, if not all, iRBD cases are due to underlying alpha‐synucleinopathy. However, the current term "clinically isolated" is also misleading because it suggests that RBD is the only clinical complaint reported in these patients, whereas most of patients also have mild motor, cognitive, and autonomic signs and symptoms; in our sample, approximately 16% of the subjects sought medical attention not for dream‐enacting behaviors, but for other symptoms. Thus, switching from a descriptive lexicon (i.e. clinically isolated RBD) to a biology‐driven lexicon should be considered.

Question 10b: what is the value of standardized polysomnographic RBD diagnosis in distinguishing PD from atypical Parkinson syndromes like PSP or MSA?

Background

Clinical isolated REM sleep behavior disorder (iRBD) is characterized by vivid, potentially harmful acting-out of dreams, sometimes with vocalizations, and observable lack of REM atonia in sleep lab settings. RBD symptoms can be assessed through questionnaires (possible RBD), but many patients are unaware of their symptoms, often requiring informant input to suggest RBD. The gold standard for diagnosis is polysomnographic examination in sleep laboratories, where, in addition to behavioral abnormalities such as punching, kicking, and yelling, the diagnosis is confirmed by the presence of incomplete or absent REM atonia.

Results

Patients with polysomnographically confirmed clinically isolated REM sleep behavior disorder (iRBD) are highly likely (> 90%) to develop a neurodegenerative disease over time, with 98% developing alpha-synucleinopathies such as PD/DLB or MSA. Thus, RBD is considered a prodromal stage not only of PD but also of alpha-synucleinopathies in general, with up to 8% of patients developing MSA. However, RBD also occurs in atypical Parkinson syndromes like PSP, vascular lesions in the brainstem, and other neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's dementia. Nonetheless, RBD is much less common in other neurodegenerative diseases compared to alpha-synucleinopathies and may occur in conjunction with Lewy body and tau pathology. Reported frequencies vary significantly due to small sample sizes. In PSP, RBD has been observed in 20–50% of patients, while in MSA, one study found absent REM atonia in 90% of patients via polysomnography, though smaller studies report frequencies around 20%. Polysomnographic changes in RBD do not fundamentally differ between patients with PD and MSA but may vary in severity depending on the cohort, often due to small sample sizes.

Recommendation (new in German guideline, 2023)

Polysomnography for confirming RBD can be considered. If RBD is detected, the presence of an alpha-synucleinopathy (PD and MSA) is more likely than a tauopathy. However, the absence of RBD does not exclude an alpha-synucleinopathy, and differentiation between different alpha-synucleinopathies cannot be made.

Consensus strength: 100%, strong consensus.

Question 11: how effective is prognosis estimation in PD considering non-motor symptoms (RBD, hyposmia, constipation, depression, orthostasis) compared to purely motor criteria?

### Association of specific biotypes in patients with parkinson disease and disease progression [^9a305bb1]. Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Patients with Parkinson disease (PD) present heterogeneous motor and nonmotor clinical manifestations and have a variable prognosis. Although the diagnosis of PD is dependent on the presence of tremor, bradykinesia, and rigidity, some nonmotor phenomena — e.g. REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD), hyposmia, and depression — can precede motor deficits by several years. Conversely, as the disease progresses, nonmotor problems such as autonomic disturbances, sleep disorders, and cognitive impairment can dominate the clinical picture in some patients. Recent evidence suggests that PD may have several biotypes, but their identity and neurobiological basis remain poorly understood. Assuming that homogeneous groups of patients are more likely to share pathologic features, recognition of different subcategories of patients with PD may be key to better understanding underlying biological mechanisms, predicting disease profile and progression, and eventually designing more efficient personalized clinical trials.

Drug-induced/exacerbated REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) — conditional discontinuation, diagnosis, and antidepressant strategy are specified: "drug-induced/exacerbated RBD is the most common etiology for RBD in patients younger than age 50 years", and the panel makes "a conditional recommendation for drug discontinuation in drug-induced/exacerbated RBD if it is safe to do so". If dream enactment persists after stopping the inciting agent, the guideline states "we recommend diagnosing the patients with either isolated RBD or secondary RBD (if there is a clear underlying disorder) and treating accordingly", noting that reducing or stopping a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor "may take several months" for improvement and that RBD after an inciting agent may emerge within "weeks or months, not years". For those still needing antidepressants, it notes "many do well on an agent with a lower serotonergic profile such as bupropion", and advises "The risks and benefits of discontinuing a drug known to induce RBD that has been taken uneventfully for a prolonged period of time should be carefully assessed".

### Clinical subtypes in patients with isolated REM sleep behaviour disorder [^00981092]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2023). Medium credibility.

Results

We included 66 patients with iRBD (8 females) and 25 healthy control (HC) subjects (five females). The mean age of patients was 66.8 ± 6.4 years, with an average iRBD duration of 7.9 ± 6.0 years. HC subjects did not differ significantly regarding sex and age. Clinical baseline data of all patients with iRBD and HC subjects are summarised in Supplementary Table 1.

Model characteristics of cluster analysis

Two iRBD clusters were identified by the two-step cluster analysis. Correctly identified items at Sniffin' Sticks (variable importance index (VII): 1), dominant EEG peak frequency (VII: 0.41), disease duration (VII: 0.34), amount of RSWA (VII: 0.18), depression (VII: 0.11), and motor symptoms (VII: 0.09) were the variables with highest informative value to discriminate two clusters based on the given quality indicators. The silhouette measure of cohesion and separation was 0.3, indicating a fair structure.

Description of iRBD clusters and post-hoc comparison

Detailed characteristics of both iRBD clusters are given in Table 1 and Supplementary Table 2. The first cluster (Cluster I, late onset — aggressive) encompassed 22 patients with iRBD and was characterised by a higher age of onset of RBD symptoms but a shorter disease duration. The second cluster (Cluster II, early onset — benign) encompassed 44 patients with an earlier onset of RBD yet a longer disease duration (age at onset, Cluster I: 62.4 ± 6.2 years vs. Cluster II: 56.9 ± 7.7 years, t (64) = −2.935, p = 0.005; disease duration, Cluster I: 4.4 ± 2.6 years vs. Cluster II: 9.7 ± 6.5 years, U = 238.500, z = −3.339, p < 0.001). Still, both clusters of patients had comparable ages at iRBD diagnosis.

Secondary RBD due to a medical condition — definition and conditional guidance — includes underlying disorder associations and recommended therapies. Patients with secondary RBD have an emergence of dream enactment with PSG-documented elevation in REM sleep motor tone in the presence of a clear underlying disorder, most commonly an alpha-synuclein disorder such as dementia with Lewy bodies or Parkinson disease, or type I narcolepsy, and in DLB/PD it is more likely in older patients (> 50 years old). The guideline states, We are making conditional recommendations for the use of 3 agents in the treatment of secondary RBD: clonazepam, immediate-release melatonin, and rivastigmine, and also chose to make a conditional recommendation against the use of deep brain stimulation (DBS) for secondary RBD; targeting subthalamic or globus pallidus interna regions has not demonstrated improved dream enactment control in PD with RBD. Several disease-targeted treatments did not meet the threshold for recommendation but may be considered in appropriate clinical contexts rather than solely for RBD.

### Dysautonomia and REM sleep behavior disorder contributions to progression of Parkinson's disease phenotypes [^fb3209ba]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Non-motor symptoms often precede the classic motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD). In particular, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD) and pure autonomic failure (PAF) have been noted to be prodromal syndromes with high rates of phenoconversion to manifest central neurodegenerative synucleinopathies such as PD, dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), or multiple system atrophy (MSA) –. RBD is a parasomnia characterized by recurrent episodes of dream-enactment behavior, including vocalizations and/or complex motor movements, resulting from loss of atonia during REM sleep. Idiopathic RBD (iRBD) is thought to represent an early brainstem manifestation of α-synuclein pathology. Clinically, > 80% of patients with iRBD will progress to neurodegenerative synucleinopathies within 10–14 years. In a large, autopsy-validated cohort of RBD patients, synucleinopathy was determined to be the underlying neuropathology in 94% of cases. Thus, RBD provides an important window to identify patients who are at risk of developing neurodegeneration from synucleinopathy.
