## Question

What is the expected prognosis for a 4-year-old with agenesis of the corpus callosum?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the expected prognosis for a 4-year-old with agenesis of the corpus callosum. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about diagnostic confirmation and anatomic classification. Then, I should determine whether the condition is isolated or non-isolated and evaluate genetic contributions. Next, I will assess neurodevelopmental domains relevant at age 4. After that, I need to integrate risk modifiers like partial versus complete ACC and ventriculomegaly. Finally, I will synthesize an individualized prognostic estimate, outline management and surveillance, and conclude with a balanced prognostic summary, all while double-checking each inference against the literature to avoid overstatement.

> Let me first confirm and classify the diagnosis because prognostic counseling hinges on accurate postnatal anatomy. Wait, let me verify the imaging sequence and views used. Prenatal ultrasound identifies ACC with variable accuracy, with one study showing about 73% sensitivity and frequent misclassification between complete and partial forms, so a postnatal MRI with a midline sagittal view is essential to distinguish complete agenesis from partial agenesis, hypoplasia, or dysplasia and to correct prenatal mislabeling when present [^112zhfHG] [^114YM3Hf] [^112Kc3Eu]. I need to ensure we are not conflating thin yet present callosal tissue with true partial agenesis, and I should double-check for associated midline signs like elevated third ventricle, colpocephaly, or Probst bundles which can support the diagnosis on MRI [^112Kc3Eu].

> Next, I should determine whether the ACC is truly isolated or non-isolated, because that distinction drives prognosis more than the label of complete versus partial alone. Hold on, I should verify that the postnatal MRI excluded cortical malformations, posterior fossa anomalies, interhemispheric cysts, or lipomas, and that a systematic review of the brainstem and cerebellum was performed, since subtle lesions can be missed prenatally and alter outcome [^117KjdX4] [^112Kc3Eu]. I need to check genetic testing because chromosomal microarray yields about 12.5% in ACC overall and whole exome sequencing adds up to 30% yield in apparently isolated cases and up to 47% across ACC cohorts, so a negative genetic workup strengthens an isolated designation and a positive result modifies prognosis [^115H4Fdi]. I should also confirm ophthalmologic and endocrine screening for septo‑optic dysplasia where indicated, since misclassification of septal or optic pathway anomalies can occur on prenatal studies and impacts prognosis and surveillance [^117Jy5A7].

> I will now examine the prognostic impact of isolation status, but wait, I should not jump to conclusions before reconciling heterogeneous cohorts. In truly isolated ACC confirmed by MRI and negative genetics, about 65% to 75% of children achieve normal neurodevelopment, with the remainder showing mild to severe impairments, while additional malformations or syndromic diagnoses markedly worsen outcomes with higher rates of epilepsy, cerebral palsy, and significant disability, so I should confirm isolation with rigor before counseling [^111RYq5g] [^115H4Fdi]. Let me reconsider any tendency to overgeneralize from small series, because outcomes vary widely and are sensitive to ascertainment and follow-up bias in the literature, which I need to acknowledge as I interpret percentages for individual counseling.

> Next, I should review neurodevelopmental domains particularly relevant at age 4 and decide on appropriate assessments. I need to check cognitive performance because isolated ACC cohorts show roughly two thirds to three quarters within the normal IQ range, but a meaningful minority have borderline or lower scores, so formal testing with WPPSI or similar measures is warranted to detect subtle deficits that might not be obvious on routine exam [^111RYq5g] [^111xm8ZZ]. Let me think about language and communication, since prospective data suggest communication delays can appear by 6 months and persist, with about 29% delayed across at least one adaptive domain by 24 months despite relatively preserved socialization, which can still be relevant at age 4 and guide early speech therapy referrals [^116cJtAS]. I should double-check motor domains, where meta-analysis shows abnormal gross motor function in about 4% to 5% and fine motor issues in about 11% in isolated complete ACC, with higher risks in partial ACC, so targeted PT and OT screening at this age is appropriate [^112ofNxC] [^114ggksp]. I need to ensure screening for autism features given the reported co-occurrence around 27% in ACC cohorts and to evaluate executive function and adaptive skills as the child approaches school age [^117A77RF] [^116cJtAS].

> Hold on, I should review genetic modifiers because a positive genetic finding often trumps an otherwise favorable imaging profile. Aicardi syndrome usually confers early-onset epilepsy and profound developmental impairment, Andermann syndrome adds progressive neuropathy and severe motor disability, and certain USP7 variants are linked to white matter paucity and callosal dysmorphism, all of which portend poorer outcomes than imaging alone would suggest, so I need to correlate any variant with known phenotypes before prognosticating [^116om8nk] [^116Nr6Bd] [^112skieK] [^116SKtwq]. But wait, I should also note that DCC variants may be associated with ACC and congenital mirror movements and can show relatively favorable neuropsychological profiles when mirror movements are absent, so a DCC finding without additional anomalies can carry one of the better prognoses among monogenic etiologies, which I should confirm case by case [^117VmAkK].

> I will now integrate individual risk modifiers into a practical prognostic estimate, but first I should verify the callosal subtype and ventriculomegaly status. If ACC is complete, truly isolated, and genetically negative, I would estimate around a 65% to 75% likelihood of normal development, roughly 13% to 22% chance of mild to moderate delays, and about 10% to 15% risk of significant disability, while acknowledging cohort heterogeneity and confidence intervals around these figures [^111RYq5g] [^111xm8ZZ]. If ACC is partial or hypoplastic, I need to consider a higher risk of chromosomal anomalies and somewhat higher rates of cognitive impairment and epilepsy versus complete ACC, although I should correct a common misconception here, because when isolation is strictly applied some cohorts find similar developmental ranges between partial and complete ACC, so I must weigh the total context rather than the label alone [^114ggksp] [^112ofNxC] [^11129fxu]. If ventriculomegaly is present at or above 15 mm, I should counsel that the risk of developmental delay is very high even when ACC appears isolated, and I need to confirm whether that threshold applied in the specific measurements for this child [^115LyFvC].

> Next, I should outline immediate management and surveillance tailored to a 4-year-old. Let me first confirm access to a multidisciplinary team including pediatric neurology, developmental pediatrics, and therapies, since early and ongoing intervention improves functional outcomes in high-risk groups even when initial milestones look reassuring, and individualized testing will guide school readiness planning [^1111Hj4b] [^111xm8ZZ]. I need to check for seizure signs or regression and obtain an EEG if there is clinical suspicion, given epilepsy prevalence estimates around 7% in isolated complete ACC and higher in partial or complex forms, and I should review family education on seizure recognition and safety [^112ofNxC] [^114ggksp]. I should confirm vision and hearing screenings and consider genetics re-evaluation if new features emerge, because evolving phenotypes can uncover syndromic etiologies that refine prognosis and alter surveillance [^115H4Fdi] [^114E9G6X].

> For long-term planning, I will now consider school-based supports and evolving risks through adolescence. I need to ensure neuropsychological testing before kindergarten entry to capture executive function, processing speed, and interhemispheric integration demands that become more apparent with increasing academic complexity, and to establish an individualized education plan when needed [^1111Hj4b]. But wait, what if early outcomes are normal. Even then, I should counsel that subtle deficits may emerge between ages 10 and 20, including executive dysfunction and neuropsychiatric issues, so periodic reassessment is prudent, and families should be prepared for a dynamic prognosis rather than a static one [^113EJohh] [^111RYq5g]. I should double-check that follow-up intervals and measures are standardized to improve comparability and avoid missed needs, as recommended in frameworks for high-risk children [^1111Hj4b].

> Finally, I will synthesize a concise prognostic summary for a 4-year-old with ACC. Best case, when ACC is complete, truly isolated on high-quality postnatal MRI with negative genetic testing, and the child shows age-appropriate function by 4 years, there is roughly a 70% chance of sustained typical development with about a 20% risk of mild to moderate learning or behavioral needs and around a 10% risk of substantial disability, while still acknowledging late-emerging vulnerabilities in executive functions and adaptive skills that warrant surveillance [^111RYq5g] [^115H4Fdi] [^113EJohh]. Worst case, when ACC is non-isolated or linked to a pathogenic syndrome, the likelihood of moderate to severe developmental disability exceeds 90% in several cohorts and the risks of epilepsy, cerebral palsy, and complex medical needs rise substantially, which should be communicated alongside supportive care planning and family resources, while noting selection and follow-up biases in these series [^notfound] [^notfound] [^112ofNxC]. I should confirm with the family that prognosis is inherently heterogeneous and evolves with time, and that our estimates are anchored in the best available but imperfect evidence, which is why structured follow-up and responsive interventions are central to optimizing outcomes [^112ofNxC] [^1111Hj4b].

---

The prognosis for a 4-year-old with agenesis of the corpus callosum (ACC) is highly variable and depends on whether it is isolated or accompanied by other anomalies [^112ofNxC]. In isolated ACC, approximately **65–75% have normal or near-normal cognitive outcomes**, though subtle learning, language, or social difficulties are common [^111RYq5g]; **25–35% have mild to moderate delays** [^115H4Fdi], and about 10% have severe impairment. In non-isolated ACC, the risk of significant intellectual disability, epilepsy, and motor impairment is much higher [^114RcKZv]. Early intervention and ongoing developmental monitoring are **essential** [^1111Hj4b], as challenges may emerge with age [^116cJtAS].

## Neurodevelopmental outcomes

| **Attribute** | **Isolated ACC** | **Non-isolated ACC** |
|-|-|-|
| Cognitive and intellectual outcomes | Approximately 65–75% of children have normal or near-normal cognitive outcomes [^115H4Fdi], though subtle deficits in executive function, processing speed, and problem-solving are common [^111RYq5g] | When ACC is associated with other brain anomalies or genetic syndromes, the risk of significant intellectual disability increases substantially [^11129fxu] |
| Motor development | Most children achieve independent ambulation [^111xm8ZZ], but mild motor coordination difficulties and delayed motor milestones are common | Motor impairment, including cerebral palsy and significant motor delays, is more frequent [^114RcKZv] |
| Language and communication | Language development is often delayed [^114RcKZv], with difficulties in pragmatic language, comprehension, and expressive language skills [^1171bvgD] | Severe language impairment is common, particularly when associated with other brain anomalies or genetic syndromes [^11129fxu] |
| Behavioral and social outcomes | Behavioral issues, including attention deficits, social communication difficulties, and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) features [^117A77RF], are common | Behavioral and social impairments are more severe and frequent, often requiring specialized interventions [^114RcKZv] |

## Neurological complications

### Seizures and epilepsy

Isolated ACC is associated with approximately **10–15%** of children developing seizures or epilepsy [^114RcKZv], typically manageable with medication; **Non-isolated ACC** has more frequent and often refractory seizures, particularly in syndromic forms such as Aicardi syndrome [^116om8nk].

---

### Hydrocephalus

Isolated ACC is rarely associated with **hydrocephalus**, whereas **Non-isolated ACC** commonly presents with hydrocephalus [^111zgBFr], particularly when interhemispheric cysts or other brain malformations are present [^115cFWn4], often requiring surgical intervention.

---

## Factors influencing prognosis

Several factors **significantly influence the prognosis** of children with ACC:

| **Factor** | **Impact on prognosis** |
|-|-|
| Presence of additional brain anomalies | Strongly associated with poorer cognitive, motor, and behavioral outcomes [^11129fxu] |
| Genetic syndromes | Significantly increase risk of intellectual disability, seizures, and motor impairment [^114RcKZv] |
| Type of ACC (complete vs. partial) | Complete ACC generally associated with more severe outcomes than partial ACC |
| Early intervention | Early therapeutic interventions improve developmental outcomes significantly |

---

## Long-term functional independence

Regarding long-term functional independence, **Isolated ACC** often allows many children to achieve independence — including independent ambulation, basic self-care [^112ofNxC], and participation in mainstream education — though subtle cognitive and social difficulties may persist [^111xm8ZZ]. In contrast, **Non-isolated ACC** is frequently associated with limited independence, and many children require ongoing support for daily activities, mobility, and communication [^114RcKZv].

---

## Recommended interventions and therapies

Early and ongoing interventions are **critical for optimizing outcomes** [^116cJtAS]:

- **Early intervention programs**: Speech therapy, occupational therapy, and physical therapy to address developmental delays [^1111Hj4b].

- **Educational support**: Individualized education plans (IEPs) and specialized educational support [^1171bvgD].

- **Behavioral therapy**: Applied behavior analysis (ABA) and social skills training for behavioral and social difficulties.

- **Medical management**: Antiepileptic medications for seizures, surgical interventions for hydrocephalus or other structural anomalies [^111zgBFr].

---

## Conclusion

The prognosis for a 4-year-old with ACC is highly variable and depends on whether the condition is isolated or associated with other anomalies. Isolated ACC generally has a favorable prognosis, with many children achieving normal or near-normal cognitive and motor outcomes, though subtle deficits may persist [^111RYq5g]. Non-isolated ACC carries significantly poorer outcomes, including intellectual disability, seizures, and motor impairment [^11129fxu]. Early intervention and ongoing developmental monitoring are **essential** for optimizing outcomes [^1111Hj4b].

### Neurodevelopment after prenatal diagnosis of isolated agenesis of the corpus callosum: an integrative review [^111RYq5g]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2012). Low credibility.

To systematically review published data on the neurodevelopment of children that were diagnosed prenatally with isolated agenesis of the corpus callosum, Medline and Scopus searches were conducted from 1960 to July 2011, along with cross-referencing of retrieved articles.

Sixteen reports, encompassing 132 cases of apparently isolated agenesis of the corpus callosum, were included in the analysis. The rates of normal outcomes, borderline or moderate disability, and severe disability were 94/132 (71.2%; 95% confidence interval, 63.0–78.3), 18/132 (13.6%; 95% CI, 8.8–20.5), and 22/132 (15.2%; 95% CI, 10.0–22.2), respectively. Magnetic resonance imaging detected additional cerebral abnormalities in 22.5% (95% CI, 12.3–37.5) of cases that appeared to be isolated agenesis of the corpus callosum. In truly isolated agenesis of the corpus callosum, confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging, the rates of normal neurodevelopment and severe disability were 52/69 (75.4%; 95% CI, 64.0–84.0) and 8/69 (11.6%; 95% CI, 6.0–21.2), respectively.

Prenatally diagnosed, isolated agenesis of the corpus callosum is usually associated with a favorable outcome. However, larger, prospective series are required as data are limited and inconsistent, preventing subgroup analyses (e.g. complete vs. partial agenesis of the corpus callosum).

### Agenesis of the corpus callosum: What to tell expecting parents [^115H4Fdi]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2023). Low credibility.

Agenesis of the corpus callosum (ACC) is one of the most common brain malformations, with an incidence estimated to range from 0.5 to 70 in 10,000 among the general population. Prenatal diagnosis is made via ultrasound; however, fetal MRI is useful to confirm or exclude the presence of associated cerebral abnormalities — mostly cortical malformations — that may affect postnatal prognosis. When no additional central nervous system (CNS) or extra CNS anomalies are identified and no genetic cause is found, an isolated ACC is diagnosed. Overall, in cases of ACC, an underlying genetic cause can be identified in up to 12.5% with chromosomal microarray (CMA) and up to 47% with whole exome sequencing (WES). In cases where ACC is the only anomaly detected, the yield of WES is 30%. Postnatal outcomes are variable and depend on whether the condition is isolated or not. In truly isolated ACC, outcomes range from normal in 65% of cases through mild to severe neurodevelopmental impairments in 35% of cases. An interdisciplinary team of medical experts is key in guiding parents toward informed decision-making in pregnancies complicated by ACC. Considering expected advancements in genetic testing and imaging technologies in upcoming years, we herein summarize recommendations for the management and prenatal counseling of expecting parents of fetuses with ACC. Our review pertains primarily to expecting parents of fetuses with complete ACC.

### Behavior and corpus callosum morphology relationships in velocardiofacial syndrome (22q11.2 deletion syndrome) [^115MqcEZ]. Psychiatry Research (2005). Low credibility.

Velocardiofacial syndrome (VCFS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by a microdeletion on chromosome 22q11.2 that predisposes affected individuals to learning disabilities and psychiatric conditions. Previous research has indicated that, compared with control children, children with VCFS have larger corpus callosal areas. Children with VCFS are often diagnosed with comorbid attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Prior studies have suggested that children with ADHD often have smaller corpus callosal areas than controls.

The present study investigated two hypotheses. First, children with VCFS would have larger callosal areas than controls. Second, children with VCFS+ADHD would have smaller callosal areas than children with VCFS alone. Corpus callosum area was obtained from the mid-sagittal slice and was assessed in children with VCFS (n = 60) and age- and gender-matched control participants (n = 52).

Results indicated that all corpus callosum measurements were significantly different between the two groups, except for the genu. Across all measures, children with VCFS demonstrated a larger corpus callosum area. Within the VCFS sample, children with VCFS+ADHD (n = 30) had smaller total callosal, splenium, and genu areas than children with VCFS alone. Relative to control participants, children with VCFS+ADHD had larger total callosal and subregion areas, except for the genu. In addition to other anatomic anomalies, corpus callosal abnormalities appear to be another variable to consider in analysis.

### Kidins220 variant associated with hypoplasia of the corpus callosum and aqueduct stenosis [^115wNvA8]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2025). Low credibility.

- **What's already known about this topic**: Aberrant expression of KIDINS220 has been associated postnatally with neurodevelopment abnormalities and SINO syndrome. Most individuals with SINO syndrome present postnatally with macrocephaly and ventriculomegaly; however, prenatal presentation and neuropathological findings are rarely reported.

- **What does this study add**: We report a case with hypoplasia of the corpus callosum, aqueduct stenosis, and dilation of the anterior horns, secondary to a de novo likely pathogenic heterozygous variant in KIDINS220. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first prenatal report of these brain anomalies associated with the KIDINS220 variant.

### Ppa2-associated sudden cardiac death: Extending the clinical and allelic spectrum in 20 new families [^111MwzoU]. Genetics in Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Progressive neuropathy and cerebellar ataxia are frequent manifestations in mitochondrial diseases. Cerebellar hypoplasia and agenesis of the corpus callosum are less common but have been reported in mitochondrial diseases and other metabolic disorders. These observations are consistent with mitochondrial depletion or dysfunction affecting tissues requiring optimal levels of ATP availability, such as muscle and nerve cells. Therefore, neurological examination and follow-up are recommended for surviving individuals harboring pathogenic biallelic PPA2 variants.

This large cohort has enabled the identification of several variant combinations compatible with survival into childhood and beyond in some individuals from eight families:

- **Variant combinations**: The p.([Glu172Lys];[Pro228Leu]) combination in families 4 and 5; the p.([Glu172Lys];[Leu278Ser]) combination in family 17; the p.([Thr159Met];[Glu172Lys]) combination in families 7, 13, and 18; the p.([Arg127Leu];[Glu172Lys]) combination in family 16 (although this genotype in family 6 resulted in death at the age of 14 months in individual II-2); and the p.([Arg127Leu];[Arg127Leu]) combination in family 9.

Despite some surviving individuals in these families, families 4 and 16 illustrate the variability of intrafamilial expression. In family 4, individuals II-2 and II-3 died of cardiac arrest at 15 years and 23 months of age, respectively, whereas their 19-year-old brother is alive with progressive spasticity and cerebellar syndrome. In family 16, two siblings died of cardiac failure at 24 and 18 months old, whereas their affected sist.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for fetal central nervous system ultrasound, specifically concerning the corpus callosum, the WAPM 2021 guidelines recommend obtaining a median/midsagittal view. This view directly demonstrates the presence or absence (complete or partial) of the corpus callosum.

### Pediatric outcome of children with the prenatal diagnosis of isolated septal agenesis [^117Jy5A7]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2010). Low credibility.

Isolated septal agenesis (SA) is a rare disease with clinical outcomes, particularly neurological outcomes, that are unknown. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical outcome of these children.

- **Methods**: We conducted a retrospective multicenter study of 17 children with isolated SA or SA combined with moderate ventricular dilatation (VD) that was diagnosed antenatally and confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performed in the antenatal period.

- **Results**: Of the 17 children, 14 had normal neurological examinations, 2 had language development delay and visuo-spatial dyspraxia, and 3 of the 17 children had behavioral problems. Eight children had neuropsychological evaluations, and the results were normal in six cases. There were 3 cases of septo-optic dysplasia (SOD) diagnosed postnatally, which highlighted the difficulties in assessing the optic tract and hypothalamic-pituitary region in antenatal imaging. Language delay and behavioral disorders were the main abnormalities at follow-up.

- **Conclusion**: The discovery of an isolated SA reveals the difficulties of prenatal diagnosis in correlating the neurological and functional prognosis to morphological findings. The prognosis seemed to be good. It appears necessary to improve the diagnostic performance of fetal brain imaging and to follow up with these children prospectively to assess their long-term cognitive-behavioral outcomes.

### Long term follow-up of high-risk children: who, why and how [^1111Hj4b]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

The number of studies reporting long-term outcomes of high-risk children is rapidly increasing. However, the methods of these follow-up studies vary widely, with sources of variability including inclusion criteria, timing of assessments, outcome measures, and use of appropriate control groups. As a result, it is difficult to compare the results of published studies or to aggregate the data to provide more certainty around the rates of some important outcomes. Outcome statistics are needed for counseling families, as well as to guide practitioners who follow high-risk groups to know what outcomes can be expected and at what ages specific problems may emerge. This information can also be linked to evidence-based pathways to assist families in accessing management resources.

While it is widely accepted that high-risk infants need close monitoring and surveillance, a framework for this practice has only infrequently been developed; for example, in one instance for a selected group of infants over the first five years of life. In addition to being useful for informing clinical follow-up programs, a framework could also assist longitudinal research with high-risk infants and help to improve the uniformity of follow-up time-points and measures. The aim of this report is to provide a framework for identifying which children need specialized follow-up, what outcomes should or could be of interest, and how, where, and when follow-up should be conducted.

### Prenatal ultrasound diagnosis of Toriello-Carey syndrome [^112WCLD2]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2002). Low credibility.

Toriello-Carey syndrome is a rare malformative complex, first described in 1988, characterized by agenesis of the corpus callosum, facial anomalies, cardiac defects, and hypotonia. Relatively few neonatal cases have been reported. Here, we describe the first prenatal ultrasound diagnosis of the syndrome based on the detection of agenesis of the corpus callosum and spongious cardiomyopathy in a 22-week-old fetus from a couple with a positive family history. The couple's first child was diagnosed with Toriello-Carey syndrome at 1 year of age and had, in addition to the typical facial anomalies not detectable by ultrasound, agenesis of the corpus callosum and the same heart lesion (spongious cardiomyopathy). This report demonstrates that prenatal diagnosis of Toriello-Carey syndrome is feasible in the second trimester of pregnancy.

### Monozygotic twins with trisomy 21 and partial agenesis of the corpus callosum [^111mNQJa]. Pediatric Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

Trisomy 21 is the most common viable trisomy and is invariably associated with mild to severe developmental delay and intellectual disability. However, no gross central nervous system malformation has been consistently identified in individuals with trisomy 21. We present the case of a monozygotic twin pregnancy in which both fetuses were identified as having trisomy 21 and partial agenesis of the corpus callosum. This rare association is discussed in the context of an emerging understanding of the neurobiology of trisomy 21.

### Agenesis of the corpus callosum: An MR imaging analysis of associated abnormalities in the fetus [^117KjdX4]. AJNR. American Journal of Neuroradiology (2009). Low credibility.

Anomalies associated with callosal agenesis (ACC) found postnatally have been well documented. However, to our knowledge, no detailed MR imaging analysis of associated anomalies has been reported in a large cohort of fetuses with ACC. This study assesses those anomalies and compares them with postnatal cohorts of ACC, to identify associated fetal brain abnormalities that may give insight into etiology and outcome.

- **Materials and methods**: All cases of ACC diagnosed on fetal MR imaging during an 11-year period were retrospectively reviewed, including fetal MR imaging, postnatal MR imaging, and autopsy findings. Neurodevelopmental outcome was classified as poor in children with seizures and/or severe neurodevelopmental impairment or in cases of neonatal death.

- **Results**: Twenty-nine cases of ACC were identified. Median gestational age was 26.14 weeks (range, 19.71–36.43 weeks). Twenty-three fetuses had delayed sulcation and/or too-numerous cortical infoldings (abnormal morphology). Fifteen fetuses had cerebellar and/or brain stem abnormalities. Fetal MR imaging findings suggested a genetic syndrome in 5 fetuses and an acquired etiology or genetic/metabolic disorder in 2 fetuses. Findings were confirmed in 8 cases with postnatal MR imaging, except for delayed sulcation and small vermis, and in 4 cases with autopsy, except for periventricular nodular heterotopia and abnormalities in areas not examined by autopsy. Neurodevelopmental outcome was good in 7 and poor in 9 children.

### Distinguishing 3 classes of corpus callosal abnormalities in consanguineous families [^1151FWHD]. Neurology (2011). Low credibility.

We sought to create a classification system for pediatric corpus callosal abnormalities (CCA) based upon midline sagittal brain MRI. We used the term CCA for patients with structural variants of the corpus callosum, excluding patients with interhemispheric cyst variant or pure dysplasia without hypoplasia. Currently, no system exists for nonsyndromic forms of CCA, and attempts to create such a system have been hampered by highly variable morphology in patients with sporadic CCA. We reasoned that any useful strategy should classify affected family members within the same type and that phenotypic variability should be minimized in patients with recessive disease.

- **Methods**: We focused recruitment toward multiplex consanguineous families, ascertained 30 patients from 19 consanguineous families, and analyzed clinical features together with brain imaging.

- **Results**: We identified 3 major CCA classes, including hypoplasia, hypoplasia with dysplasia, and complete agenesis. Affected individuals within a given multiplex family usually displayed the same variant of the class of abnormality, and they always displayed the same class of abnormality within each family, or they displayed complete agenesis. The system was validated among a second cohort of 10 sporadic patients with CCA.

- **Conclusions**: The data suggest that complete agenesis may be a common end-phenotype and implicate multiple overlapping pathways in the etiology of CCA.

### Both rare and de novo copy number variants are prevalent in agenesis of the corpus callosum but not in cerebellar hypoplasia or polymicrogyria [^113wyw2P]. PLoS Genetics (2013). Low credibility.

Overcoming the limitations of prior studies, we analyzed genic CNVs in 545 patients with one or more of these three common brain malformations and in 2,349 control individuals. We hypothesized that these patients have a higher genome-wide burden of large rare genic CNVs than controls and that a significant percentage of them have large de novo likely pathogenic CNVs, including both novel and previously reported intervals. We further anticipated that many of the de novo CNVs would be sub-microscopic (less than 4 megabases (Mb)), demonstrating a larger disease burden for CNVs than previously seen through cytogenetic approaches.

### Exome sequencing identifies recessive CDK5RAP2 variants in patients with isolated agenesis of corpus callosum [^114vASap]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2016). Low credibility.

Agenesis of the corpus callosum (ACC) is a common brain malformation observed either as an isolated condition or as part of numerous congenital syndromes. Cognitive and neurological involvements in patients with ACC vary from mild linguistic and behavioral impairments to more severe neurological deficits. At the time of writing, the underlying genetic causes of isolated ACC remain elusive, and causative genes have yet to be identified.

We performed exome sequencing on three acallosal siblings from the same non-consanguineous family. We identified compound heterozygous variants, p [Gly94Arg];[Asn1232Ser], in the protein encoded by the CDK5RAP2 gene, also known as MCPH3, a gene previously reported to cause autosomal recessive primary microcephaly. Our findings suggest a novel role for this gene in the pathogenesis of isolated ACC.

### Child neurology: Functional reorganization mediating supplementary motor area syndrome recovery in agenesis of the corpus callosum [^112Vv9F8]. Neurology (2022). Low credibility.

Supplementary motor area (SMA) syndrome should always be considered after medial premotor cortex injury. Even in patients exhibiting profound neurologic deficits, a significant recovery is expected. In patients with agenesis of the corpus callosum (ACC), recovery from SMA syndrome remains possible through extracallosal compensatory mechanisms. Thus, ACC may not preclude surgical removal of lesions within the SMA.

### Retrospective analysis of the prognostic factors of fetal corpus callosum dysplasia [^113EJohh]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Low credibility.

The incidence of abnormalities of the corpus callosum (CC) is approximately 1.8 per 100,000 in the general population and 230–600 per 100,000 in individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders. The long-term outcomes of fetuses with abnormalities of the CC are mainly related to the etiology of the condition and whether abnormalities of the CC appear isolated on imaging.

The prenatal diagnosis of agenesis of the CC (ACC) has been comprehensively described. Approximately two-thirds of children with isolated complete agenesis of the CC (CACC) have good developmental outcomes. However, these children may have different degrees of defects that become more obvious between 10 and 20 years of age, including neuropsychological and behavioral disorders. Children with partial agenesis of the CC (PACC) or nonisolated ACC have worse later-life prognoses. However, there is limited information on short, thin, or thick CCs. The wide range of neurodevelopmental presentations associated with ACC indicates the necessity of the accurate assessment and diagnosis of fetuses, to better inform prenatal counseling.

In this study, we classified short, thin, and thick CCs as dysplastic corpus callosums (DCCs) and retrospectively analyzed the clinical data, pregnancy outcomes, and neurodevelopmental outcomes of children with antenatal diagnoses of PACC and DCC in our center. Factors influencing fetal CC abnormalities were also analyzed. These data provide evidence for the clinical consultation and management of fetal PACC and DCC.

### Fetal callosal anomalies: A narrative review and practical recommendations for pediatric neurologists [^114E9G6X]. Pediatric Neurology (2025). Low credibility.

Agenesis of the corpus callosum is a common indication for fetal neurology consultation, increasingly identified through advances in fetal sonography and fetal magnetic resonance imaging. Despite improvements in diagnostic accuracy, prognostic counseling is challenging due to highly variable neurodevelopmental outcomes. Several factors contribute to neurodevelopmental outcome variability, including associated anomalies and etiologic considerations such as genetic, acquired, and environmental factors. This narrative review discusses existing literature on prenatal findings, postnatal outcomes, and comorbidities to provide practical guidelines for prenatal diagnosis, counseling, and postnatal management. Additionally, practice and research gaps are identified to advocate for guidelines to improve counseling, management, and optimization of outcomes for affected children and families.

### Corpus callosum agenesis in trisomy 8p11.23 and monosomy 4q34 because of maternal translocation [^112i7HAt]. Pediatric Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

We report on a 3-year-old boy with partial trisomy 8 p11.23→pter and partial monosomy 4q34→qter, associated with developmental delay, complete agenesis of the corpus callosum, and mild dysmorphic features. Although agenesis of the corpus callosum is not a rare finding among chromosomal abnormalities, partial trisomy 8p together with partial monosomy 4q, resulting from a maternal translocation, was not previously reported, to the best of our knowledge.

### Reduced relationship to cortical white matter volume revealed by tractography-based segmentation of the corpus callosum in young children with developmental delay [^111V6xAF]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2006). Low credibility.

The corpus callosum is the primary anatomical substrate for interhemispheric communication, which is important for a range of adaptive and cognitive behaviors in early development. Previous studies that have measured the corpus callosum in developmental populations have been limited by the use of rather arbitrary methods of subdividing the corpus callosum. The purpose of this study was to measure the corpus callosum in a clinical group of developmentally delayed children using a subdivision that more accurately reflected the anatomical properties of the corpus callosum.

The authors applied tractography to subdivide the corpus callosum into regions corresponding to the cortical regions to and from which its fibers travel in a clinical group of very young children with developmental delay, a precursor to general mental retardation, in comparison with typically developing children.

The data demonstrate that the midsagittal area of the entire corpus callosum is reduced in children presenting with developmental delay, reflected in the smaller area of each of the fiber-based callosal subdivisions. In addition, while the area of each subdivision was strongly and significantly correlated with the corresponding cortical white matter volume in comparison subjects, this correlation was prominently absent in the developmentally delayed group.

A fiber-based subdivision successfully separates lobar regions of the corpus callosum, and the areas of these regions distinguish a developmentally delayed clinical group from the comparison group.

### Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) diagnosis of fetal corpus callosum abnormalities and follow-up analysis [^113rpVyA]. Journal of Child Neurology (2021). Low credibility.

We analyzed the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) manifestations of fetal corpus callosum abnormalities and discussed their prognosis based on the results of postnatal follow-up.

- **Methods**: One hundred fifty-five fetuses were diagnosed with corpus callosum abnormalities by MRI at our hospital from 2004 to 2019. Gesell Development Scales were used to evaluate the prognosis of corpus callosum abnormalities after birth.

- **Results**: Corpus callosum abnormalities were diagnosed in 149 fetuses from singleton pregnancies, and 6 pairs of twins, where 1 in each pair had a corpus callosum abnormality. Twenty-seven cases (27/155) were lost to follow-up, whereas 128 cases (128/155) were followed up. Of these, 101 cases were induced for labor, whereas 27 cases were born naturally. Among the 27 cases of corpus callosum abnormality after birth, 22 cases were from singleton pregnancies (22/27). Moreover, 1 twin from each of 5 pairs of twins (5/27) demonstrated corpus callosum abnormalities. The average Gesell Development Scale score was 87.1 in 19 cases of agenesis of the corpus callosum and 74.9 in 3 cases of hypoplasia of the corpus callosum. Among the 5 affected twins, 2 had severe neurodevelopmental delay, 2 had mild neurodevelopmental delay, and 1 was premature and died.

- **Conclusion**: The overall prognosis of agenesis of the corpus callosum is good in singleton pregnancies. Hypoplasia of the corpus callosum is often observed with other abnormalities, and the development quotient of hypoplasia of the corpus callosum is lower compared with agenesis of the corpus callosum.

### Neurological and clinical outcomes in infants and children with a fetal diagnosis of asymmetric ventriculomegaly, interhemispheric cyst, and dysgenesis of the corpus callosum [^111zgBFr]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics (2022). Low credibility.

Advances in prenatal imaging have facilitated improvements in the fetal diagnosis of congenital anomalies. Asymmetric ventriculomegaly, interhemispheric cyst, and dysgenesis of the corpus callosum (AVID) is a constellation of congenital anomalies reported in fetal imaging. However, few data are available regarding postnatal outcomes of infants and children with a fetal diagnosis of AVID. The authors sought to report the neurodevelopmental outcomes of patients diagnosed with AVID before birth at a single institution.

- **Methods**: An institutional fetal imaging database was queried to identify cases with ventriculomegaly, interhemispheric cyst, and dysgenesis of the corpus callosum over a 10-year study period from 2000 to 2019. Overall, 41 maternal-infant dyads who met imaging criteria for AVID were identified. Medical records were reviewed for prenatal variables, including gestational age at birth and perinatal complications, including fetal demise, as well as postnatal variables including demographics, mortality, hydrocephalus diagnosis and management, epilepsy, and neurodevelopmental outcomes at 2 years or the last follow-up.

- **Results**: Among 41 patients, 25 (61%) were male. A slight majority of patients (55%) were born before 36 weeks of gestational age, and 27 patients (68%) were delivered via cesarean section because their head size precluded vaginal delivery. There were 8 incidences of fetal demise, 1 pregnancy was terminated, and 32 patients were born alive. Neonatal or early infant death occurred in 5 patients, and two children died during follow-up after the neonatal period.

### Analyses of pathological cranial ultrasound findings in neonates that fall outside recent indication guidelines: Results of a population-based birth cohort: Survey of neonates in Pommerania (SNiP-study) [^111n7Jm8]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Low credibility.

In the general population, the incidence of partial or complete agenesis of the corpus callosum is 0.3 to 0.7%, and it can be detected with CU. The outcome of partial agenesis of the corpus callosum spans a large range, from mild behavioral problems to severe neurological disorders. Compared to complete agenesis, partial agenesis is associated with a higher probability of combined genetic syndromes, aneuploidies, further cerebral malformations, inborn errors of metabolism, and extracerebral malformations. Compared to the intelligence of the general population, children with isolated corpus callosum agenesis have a higher probability of borderline intelligence and a lower probability of a Full Scale Intelligence Quotient ≥ 100. In this study, we found a cumulative incidence of isolated corpus callosum agenesis of 0.03% in group II, similar to that reported by Wang et al. (0.08%), but we found no correlation with neurological impairment.

IVH ≥ II° can induce epileptic disorders, perceptual difficulties, cognitive deficiencies, and mental handicaps. In particular, IVH can induce a worse outcome in full-term neonates than in preterm neonates. Even a mild IVH alone can independently impact neurological outcomes, compared to no IVH. We found a 0.05% cumulative incidence of IVH in group II, which was lower than the incidences found in studies by Gover (0.2%) and Wang et al. (0.1%), and we found no association with neurological impairment.

Our results suggested that it is not necessary to extend the recent CU guidelines for neonates without a CU indication.

### Both rare and de novo copy number variants are prevalent in agenesis of the corpus callosum but not in cerebellar hypoplasia or polymicrogyria [^117A77RF]. PLoS Genetics (2013). Low credibility.

Given the co-occurrence of agenesis of the corpus callosum (ACC) and autism in numerous prior reports, we asked whether copy number variants (CNVs) observed in ACC and those in autism overlapped — that is, whether at least 50% of the genes in autism CNVs were also found in ACC CNVs. De novo CNVs in autism were compiled from several studies and are listed in Table S6. We found that 13 out of 34 (38.24%) de novo CNVs, but only 5 out of 66 (7.58%) inherited CNVs in ACC patients, overlapped with de novo CNVs reported in autism (p = 3.06 × 10⁻⁴; OR = 7.55; 95% CI = 2.40–23.72). The observed overlap may partly be explained by the co-occurrence of autism in our ACC cohort, as 47 of 172 (27.3%) ACC patients evaluated were diagnosed with this condition (Table S7), and partly by the presence of a shared genetic risk between ACC and autism.

### Structural alterations of the corpus callosum in children with infantile hydrocephalus [^112kGR9f]. Journal of Child Neurology (2024). High credibility.

The corpus callosum comprises five subdivisions, each with distinct functional connections. The posterior (splenium) part of the corpus callosum connects visual areas in the occipital lobe, whereas the midposterior (isthmus) part connects fibers of motor, somatosensory, and primary auditory areas. As the central (body) fibers traverse the cerebral cortex, they give rise to the corona radiata and contribute to the formation of various prominent white matter pathways. The midanterior (genu) part of the corpus callosum connects the medial and lateral surfaces of the frontal lobes, whereas the anterior portion (rostrum) serves as a vital bridge linking the orbital surfaces of the frontal lobes.

Understanding the intricacies of corpus callosum microstructure and volume is crucial for comprehending neurodevelopmental and pathologic processes. Microstructure, composed of intricate white matter fibers, holds essential information regarding the structural integrity and connectivity within this neural bridge. Alterations in microstructural properties can provide insights into the underlying changes, shedding light on the adaptability and resilience of the corpus callosum in response to various conditions. Similarly, changes in volume offer a macroscopic view of the structural alterations.

One study demonstrated a relationship between brain morphometry and functioning in children treated for hydrocephalus. Results revealed reductions in the size of the corpus callosum in the shunted hydrocephalus group of children aged 6–13 years and a relationship between the corpus callosum and developmental outcomes.

### Clinical outcome of children with corpus callosum agenesis [^111xm8ZZ]. Pediatric Neurology (2020). Low credibility.

Agenesis of the corpus callosum is a rare congenital brain malformation that can be associated with other cerebral malformations and/or underlying genetic causes. Prenatal counseling is hampered due to the lack of reliable long-term data on neurodevelopmental outcome.

- **Methods**: Since 2010, a total of 23 children with agenesis of the corpus callosum (mean age 3.8 years, range 0.7 to 9.7 years) were registered in our ACC outpatient clinic and diagnosed in a standardized manner; the data were analyzed retrospectively. Prenatal and postnatal imaging, associated malformations, genetic and clinical findings, and psychological testing (Bayley Scales, Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children II, Snijders-Oomen Non-verbal Test, Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale I-III) were included. The clinical outcome was classified as "normal" (intelligence quotient 85 to 115, unremarkable motor skills), "moderate developmental delay" (intelligence quotient 70 to 85, mild motor abnormalities), and "severe developmental delay" (intelligence quotient less than 70, severe movement disorder).

- **Results**: Isolated corpus callosum malformation was diagnosed in 15 of 23 (65%), associated cerebral malformations in four of 23 (17%), and associated cerebral malformations plus intracranial cyst in four of 23 (17%) children. Prenatal diagnosis changed in nine of 23 (39%) cases. Overall, a normal outcome or moderate or severe developmental delay was present in 15 of 23 (65%) or five of 23 (22%) or three of 23 (13%) children, respectively. Also, six of eight children with associated cerebral malformations showed certain outcomes.

### Andermann syndrome in a Turkish patient [^116Nr6Bd]. Journal of Child Neurology (2003). Low credibility.

Agenesis of the corpus callosum with peripheral neuropathy, or Andermann syndrome, is an autosomal recessive disorder rarely found outside certain regions of the province of Quebec, Canada. We report a 5-year-old Turkish patient with Andermann syndrome born to consanguineous parents. She presented with diffuse hypotonic weakness, predominantly in the distal extremities, and mild mental retardation. Electromyography showed axonal-demyelinating sensorimotor neuropathy, and a sural nerve biopsy was compatible with demyelinating neuropathy. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging revealed total agenesis of the corpus callosum, dilatation of the interhemispheric fissure, and enlargement of the cisterna magna. The molecular genetic analysis using microsatellite DNA markers covering the agenesis of the corpus callosum with peripheral neuropathy locus on chromosome 15q13-q15 showed that the patient is homozygous for the whole region. Our findings confirm that Andermann syndrome is a genetically homogeneous disorder.

### Structural alterations of the corpus callosum in children with infantile hydrocephalus [^114zBY7f]. Journal of Child Neurology (2024). Low credibility.

Diffusion tensor imaging is used to map and characterize the three-dimensional diffusion of water as a function of spatial location. Diffusion anisotropy is mainly caused by cellular membranes in the brain's white matter, with contributions from myelination and the packing of axons. Fractional anisotropy defines the degree to which water diffusion is constrained in a specific direction and is sensitive to the alignment of white matter fibers and their structural integrity with the degree of myelination. Fractional anisotropy values range from 0 to 1, where 0 represents complete isotropy, meaning diffusion occurs equally in all directions, and 1 represents maximum anisotropy, meaning diffusion occurs in a single direction. A study observed a correlation between the fractional anisotropy of the total corpus callosum and visuomotor interhemispheric processing speed, highlighting the functional implications of fractional anisotropy in neural processing. Higher fractional anisotropy values are associated with more coherent and well-structured fiber bundles, whereas lower fractional anisotropy values could suggest possible damage or reduced fiber integrity. Mean diffusivity relates to the average diffusion of water molecules within a region of interest and can provide insight into tissue characteristics such as integrity and microstructural changes.

When the ventricles become enlarged in hydrocephalus, inducing pressure on the surrounding brain tissue, this may lead to changes in white matter integrity and diffusion properties. Research suggests that patie…

### Adaptive functioning development in infants with agenesis of the corpus callosum [^116cJtAS]. Pediatrics (2025). Low credibility.

Agenesis of the corpus callosum (ACC) is a common congenital brain malformation. Early development in ACC remains unexamined, despite the increased likelihood for developmental delays and autistic behaviors. This study compares adaptive functioning in infants and toddlers with isolated ACC to children with other neurodevelopmental conditions and typical development.

- **Methods**: Parents of children with ACC completed the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale Interview at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months as part of a prospective longitudinal study. Comparison groups included children with fragile X, Down syndrome, high familial likelihood of autism spectrum disorder (both with and without autism spectrum diagnosis), and typical development (total n = 957; total assessments = 2676).

- **Results**: By 24 months, 29% of children with ACC were delayed in at least one domain. Linear mixed effect models showed significant group×time point interactions in all domains. Post-hoc comparisons revealed the ACC group had poorer performance in communication by 6 months, motor by 12 months, and daily living by 18 months, but equivalent socialization skills compared with typically developing children. The ACC group demonstrated stronger skills across most domains and time points compared with genetic groups, and equivalent communication, stronger socialization, and weaker motor skills compared with the autism group.

- **Conclusions**: Although there is significant variability, on average, ACC compromises communication skills by 6 months, with reduced motor and daily living skills by 12 and 18 months, respectively. A multipronged intervention program is recommended.

### Apert syndrome: What prenatal radiographic findings should prompt its consideration [^112BRXmK]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2006). Low credibility.

Apert syndrome was diagnosed in a newborn with typical facial and digital features, whose only detected prenatal abnormality had been agenesis of the corpus callosum. This prompted a review of the central nervous system findings in all cases of Apert syndrome treated at the Craniofacial Center, Boston Children's Hospital, between 1978 and 2004. Two of 30 patients with Apert syndrome had prenatal identification of mild dilatation of the lateral cerebral ventricles and complete agenesis of the corpus callosum (ACC), documented with both ultrasound and MRI. Both had the common S252W mutation of FGFR2.

Though cranial and orbital malformations typical of Apert syndrome were eventually seen in these fetuses in the third trimester, even in retrospect, these were not detectable at mid-second trimester ultrasound screening for congenital malformations. Hand malformations also went undetected in the second trimester despite extensive imaging by experienced radiologists.

We conclude that prenatal ultrasonographic identification of mild ventriculomegaly or ACC should stimulate a careful search for features of Apert syndrome and prompt follow-up imaging to look for bony abnormalities that have later onset. Prenatal molecular testing for Apert mutations should be considered in cases of mild ventriculomegaly and ACC.

### Screening performance for callosal agenesis in prenatal life. Single center study [^112zhfHG]. Clinical Imaging (2017). Low credibility.

- **Objectives**: To analyze the screening performance of second trimester scans for agenesis of the corpus callosum (ACC), evaluate the agreement between ultrasound and MRI, and compare prenatal and postnatal diagnosis.

- **Methods**: This was a prospective observational study. All patients with fetuses suspected of ACC were referred for prenatal MRI (pMRI).

- **Results**: One subject was not confirmed by pMRI with the diagnosis of ACC. This case demonstrated partial ACC in neonatal MRI (nMRI).

- **Conclusion**: Sensitivity of second trimester scan for callosal agenesis was 73% and specificity was 99%. Prenatal MRI and ultrasound have a similar amount of misdiagnoses.

### Child neurology: Functional reorganization mediating supplementary motor area syndrome recovery in agenesis of the corpus callosum [^112sb3jU]. Neurology (2022). Low credibility.

Supplementary motor area (SMA) syndrome is typically a transient condition resulting from damage to the medial premotor cortex. The exact mechanism of recovery remains unknown but is traditionally described as a process involving functional compensation by the contralateral SMA through corpus callosal fibers. This case study highlights a distinct extracallosal mechanism of functional recovery from SMA syndrome in a patient with agenesis of the corpus callosum (ACC).

We present the clinical presentation and perioperative functional neuroimaging features of a 16-year-old patient with complete ACC who exhibited recovery from an SMA syndrome resulting from surgical resection of a right-sided low-grade glioma. Preoperative fMRI revealed anatomically concordant activation areas during finger and toe tapping tasks bilaterally. Three months after surgery, the patient had fully recovered. A repeat fMRI revealed a shift of the majority of the left toe tapping area from the expected contralateral hemisphere to the ipsilateral left paracentral lobule and SMA.

The fMRI signal remodeling observed in this acallosal patient suggests that within-hemisphere plasticity of the healthy hemisphere may constitute an alternative critical process in SMA syndrome resolution. This challenges the traditional view that transcallosal fibers are necessary for functional recovery.

### Clinical and diagnostic profile of agenesis of the corpus callosum [^117VhEnt]. Journal of Child Neurology (2002). Low credibility.

This study reports the clinical profile, etiologies identified, and outcomes for a consecutive series of children with partial or complete agenesis of the corpus callosum. Children with agenesis of the corpus callosum were identified in a comprehensive computerized database of all patients seen in a single pediatric neurology practice over an 11-year interval. Medical records were then systematically reviewed.

Twenty-four children with agenesis of the corpus callosum were identified out of a total of 6911 children in the database (0.35%). Fifteen were male (62.5%); nine (37.5%) had presented antenatally, six (25%) neonatally, and nine (37.5%) postneonatally. Eight (33.3%) were microcephalic, 12 (50%) were dysmorphic, 11 (45.8%) had coexisting epilepsy, and nine (37.5%) had a cerebral palsy variant.

Investigations revealed an etiology in 11 (45.8%): three chromosomal abnormalities, three metabolic disorders, three cerebral dysgeneses, and two genetic syndromes (Aicardi, Andermann). Outcomes identified included normal or mild developmental delay in seven (29.2%) and moderate-severe developmental delay in the remaining 17 (70.8%).

- **Factors predictive of successful etiologic determination on bivariate analysis**: Moderate-severe developmental delay or associated cerebral dysgenesis.
- **Factors predictive of eventual developmental outcome**: Microcephaly, coexisting epilepsy, cerebral palsy, or cerebral dysgenesis.

A spectrum of clinical presentations, underlying etiology, and developmental outcome is thus apparent in children with agenesis of the corpus callosum. An underlying etiology can be identified.

### How should antenatal counseling be given to parents in the fetal corpus callosum agenesis [^116eYuuP]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Low credibility.

We aimed to review the corpus callosum agenesis (CCA) cases diagnosed and managed in our university to contribute to the literature on this antenatally diagnosed fetal cranial anomaly by revealing the antenatal and postnatal outcomes of CCA.

- **Methods**: This retrospective and cross-sectional study examined CCA detected in our clinic between 2012 and 2021. Genetic results, accompanying additional anomalies, termination, and perinatal mortality rates were calculated. Neurodevelopmental outcomes were evaluated by investigating motor development, cognitive development, behavioral disorders, speech delay, personal-social backwardness, and epilepsy in cases of isolated CCA and non-isolated CCA during the postnatal period.

- **Results**: Data from 30 fetuses were evaluated during the study. The number of isolated CCA and non-isolated CCA cases was 11 (37.5%) and 19 (62.5%), respectively. The number of partial CCA and complete CCA cases was 8 (26%) and 22 (74%), respectively. Among the 30 fetuses, the numbers of live births, chromosomal anomalies, perinatal mortalities, and terminations were found to be 14 (47%), 3 (10%), 3 (10%), and 13 (43%), respectively. Postnatal evaluation was performed in 14 children, and normal neurodevelopmental outcomes were observed in 5 (35.7%). All these children were from the isolated CCA group. Additionally, a poor neurodevelopmental outcome was detected in 37.5% of isolated CCA cases.

- **Conclusion**: If CCA is detected in the fetus, additional ultrasonographic anomaly and genetic examination should be performed to differentiate isolated CCA from non-isolated CCA.

### Retrospective analysis of the prognostic factors of fetal corpus callosum dysplasia [^113xN5TL]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Low credibility.

Poor prognoses have been reported for a thick corpus callosum (CC) with abnormal head circumference and/or related malformations, and the significance of an isolated thick CC is unclear. Our data suggest that short or thick CCs are more strongly associated with fetal malformations, genetic abnormalities, and a poor prognosis, which should be given adequate attention during prenatal diagnosis and consultation. The cases of thick CCs were all nonisolated in this study. Few studies have addressed the different morphologies of fetal CCs, which is precisely the significance of this study. In the isolated group, thin CCs were associated with a relatively optimistic prognosis. However, more data are needed to verify these findings, and whether isolated thin CCs can be used to diagnose CC dysplasia remains to be discussed.

This study had several limitations. Most fetuses in this study were terminated, preventing an accurate evaluation of their outcomes. The length of follow-up was also highly variable. Therefore, for infants with only one postnatal evaluation, their outcomes may not accurately reflect developmental delays since the age may have been too young to observe the progression of developmental milestones, which may underestimate the effect of CC dysplasia on neurodevelopment. Expanding the sample size, together with the standardization of neurological and developmental assessments in a prospective longitudinal study, would help to better understand the full clinical spectrum of outcomes of children with CC abnormalities.

### Pathogenic variants in USP7 cause a neurodevelopmental disorder with speech delays, altered behavior, and neurologic anomalies [^116SKtwq]. Genetics in Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

White matter paucity is the most common MRI finding in patients with USP7 pathogenic variants. The size of the corpus callosum is a reliable way to judge general myelination and the presence of white matter throughout the brain. Various measurements were taken: corpus callosum fronto-occipital diameter (FOD), anteroposterior diameter (APD), genu thickness (GT), isthmus thickness (IT), splenium thickness (ST), body thickness (BT), and the APD/FOD ratio. These were measured following procedures described elsewhere and compared with age-matched reference values. Notably, data for patient 18, who was 17 years old at the time of the scan, was compared with reference values for 15-year-old children, as values for older children were unavailable.

APD was significantly smaller in this cohort, with a mean Z-score ± standard deviation of −1.16 ± 1.17 (p = 0.0144). Similarly, ST and BT significantly decreased, with Z-score means of −0.98 ± 0.82 (p = 0.0034) and −1.18 ± 0.63 (p < 0.0001), respectively. Although FOD trended smaller, a comparison with reference values did not reach statistical significance.

- **Severe corpus callosum dysmorphism**: Z-scores fell more than two standard deviations below the mean for FOD, APD, and BT measures in patient 16, and for APD and IT measures in patient 18 (17 years old at the time of the scan; Fig. 3h), indicating severe corpus callosum dysmorphism. The FOD measurement for patient 14 was also more than two standard deviations below the mean. Additionally, patient 3, patient 13, and patient 15 (5 years old at the time of the scan; Fig. 3e) all had larger total white matter tracts.

### How should antenatal counseling be given to parents in the fetal corpus callosum agenesis [^111mNmCi]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Low credibility.

The corpus callosum (CC) is the most prominent white matter pathway connecting the brain hemispheres. This connection, consisting of nearly 200 million axons, is involved in many cognitive functions, including language, reasoning, and integration of sensory information. The CC consists of four parts from front to back: rostrum, genu, body, and splenium. Corpus callosum agenesis (CCA) is one of the most common cortical malformations. The incidence of CCA is 0.018% in live births, 2.3% among children with neurodevelopmental retardation, and 0.0053% in autopsy series.

Intellectual disability, motor and cognitive development delay, epilepsy, behavioral disorder, and social and language problems are the most common neurodevelopmental issues in children diagnosed with CCA. The severity of these problems depends on additional anomalies associated with CCA and accompanying genetic syndromes. In cases of CCA detected antenatally, identifying the cause or related anomalies may provide counseling about long-term postnatal outcomes. However, even in cases of isolated CCA, there is heterogeneity regarding neurodevelopmental outcomes. Providing counseling to pregnant women diagnosed with CCA becomes quite complicated due to subjective tests in outcome assessment and reporting, bias in patient selection, study design, length of follow-up, lack of control groups, and variable definitions. Families may choose termination, especially in cases with genetic disorders or additional ultrasound findings accompanying CCA with a poor prognosis.

### Outcomes associated with isolated agenesis of the corpus callosum: A meta-analysis [^112ofNxC]. Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Antenatal counseling in cases of agenesis of the corpus callosum (ACC) is challenging. The objective of this study was to ascertain the outcome in fetuses with isolated complete ACC and partial ACC. Data were sourced from Medline, Embase, CINAHL, and Cochrane databases. Study selection focused on reports of a prenatal diagnosis of ACC, observing outcomes such as chromosomal abnormalities at standard karyotype and chromosomal microarray (CMA) analysis, additional anomalies detected only at prenatal MRI and at postnatal imaging or clinical evaluation, concordance between prenatal and postnatal diagnosis, and neurodevelopmental outcomes.

Meta-analyses of proportions were used to combine data. Twenty-seven studies were included. In cases of complete ACC (cACC), chromosomal anomalies occurred in 4.81% (95% confidence interval, 2.2–8.4) of the cases. Gross and fine motor control were abnormal in 4.40% (95% CI, 0.6–11.3) and 10.98% (95% CI, 4.1–20.6) of the cases, respectively, whereas 6.80% (95% CI, 1.7–14.9) presented with epilepsy. Abnormal cognitive status occurred in 15.16% (95% CI, 6.9–25.9) of cases. In partial ACC, the rate of chromosomal anomalies was 7.45% (95% CI, 2.0–15.9). Fine motor control was affected in 11.74% (95% CI, 0.9–32.1) of the cases, and 16.11% (95% CI, 2.5–38.2) presented with epilepsy. Cognitive status was affected in 17.25% (95% CI, 3.0–39.7) of cases.

Limitations of this study include the use of different neurodevelopmental tools and the variability in follow-up times of the included studies. In conclusion, children with a prenatal diagnosis of isolated ACC show several degrees of impairment in motor control and cognitive status.

### How should antenatal counseling be given to parents in the fetal corpus callosum agenesis [^116kuFew]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Low credibility.

In cases of detection of corpus callosum agenesis (CCA) during pregnancy, a detailed cranial and multisystemic examination should be performed. Fetal MRI can be planned as it increases the rate of detecting additional findings by 22%. Genetic examination should be recommended for all cases of CCA. In pregnancies with non-isolated CCA, termination may be recommended to parents after informing them about the poor postnatal prognosis. In isolated CCA cases, information should be given about the neurodevelopmental outcome. In 37.5% of cases, there is a poor outcome, and the decision should be left to the family. Comprehensive prospective studies are needed to better predict neurodevelopmental outcomes in isolated CCA cases.

### How should antenatal counseling be given to parents in the fetal corpus callosum agenesis [^115EHrxU]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). High credibility.

Our study is a retrospective and cross-sectional study. It was authorized by the local Ethics Committee of Ankara University (clinical trial date 06.06.2024/number 1391402). The files and ultrasonography data of patients who underwent second-trimester ultrasonography scans between 2012 and 2021 were reviewed. Informed permission forms were acquired from all patients in the study in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.

Pregnancies with agenesis of the corpus callosum (CCA) were included in the evaluation. All ultrasonographic assessments were performed with Voluson E8 Expert (GE She Austria GmbH & Co OG) by two perinatologists with at least five years of experience in fetal neurosonography. In cases where the detection of corpus callosum anomalies during antenatal ultrasound examinations was inconclusive, antenatal or postnatal fetal cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed. All fetal brain MRIs were performed using a standardized protocol on a 1.5 Tesla MR scanner (Philips, Insignia) with a conventional phased-array body coil.

Multiple pregnancies and patients whose antenatal or postnatal follow-up could not be reached were excluded from the study. Demographic data were calculated for each pregnancy, including maternal age, parity, gestational age at diagnosis, gestational week at delivery, mode of delivery, birth weight, and infant sex. All pregnant women with CCA were offered a genetic examination that included conventional karyotyping and microarray study. Partial or complete CCA was revealed. Fetuses with no additional anomalies were observed for further study.

### Agenesis of the corpus callosum and Aicardi syndrome: A neuroimaging and clinical comparison [^116om8nk]. Pediatric Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Agenesis of the corpus callosum can occur in individuals with epilepsy, either in isolation or as part of various neurological conditions, such as Aicardi syndrome. In this study, we evaluated the clinical and neuroradiological differences between children with nonsyndromic agenesis of the corpus callosum and those with Aicardi syndrome.

- **Methods**: We evaluated 31 children with epilepsy and agenesis of the corpus callosum (11 males, 20 females), 14 of whom had Aicardi syndrome (all females). We compared their clinical evaluations, radiological and electrophysiological findings, treatments, and their outcome.

- **Results**: Median age at seizure onset was lower in the Aicardi syndrome group compared with nonsyndromic agenesis of the corpus callosum (two versus five months, P = 0.006). The developmental impairment in terms of verbalization and ambulation was significantly worse in patients with Aicardi syndrome. The severity of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and glucose metabolism positron emission tomography (PET) involvement was more extensive in children with Aicardi syndrome than in nonsyndromic agenesis of the corpus callosum. In both groups, the PET scan showed a much more extensive area of involvement than suggested by the MRI scan. Four children underwent epilepsy surgery with significant improvement, but were not seizure free. Outcome was worse in those with PET showing abnormalities in the nonsurgical hemisphere despite normal appearance on MRI. All children who did not undergo surgery also continued to have seizures at last follow-up.

- **Conclusions**: Children with agenesis of the corpus callosum demonstrate different clinical and radiological features based on the presence or absence of Aicardi syndrome.

### Genetic burden linked to founder effects in Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean illustrates the importance of genetic screening test availability [^112skieK]. Journal of Medical Genetics (2021). Low credibility.

Agenesis of the corpus callosum and peripheral neuropathy (Andermann syndrome) is an autosomal recessive motor and sensory neuropathy with agenesis of the corpus callosum. ACCPN manifests with progressive axonal degeneration and peripheral neuropathy, leading to the absence of deep tendon reflexes, atypical psychosis, mental retardation, and growth delay. On cerebral imaging, around 67.2% of patients present partial or total corpus callosum agenesis. The mean age at death is 33 years. Children usually begin to walk at a mean age of 3.8 years and lose the ability to walk at a mean age of 13.8 years. The prevalence of this condition in the world is very low, as only a few cases have been reported outside Quebec. In the population of SLSJ, the prevalence is 1/2117 live births, and 1/23 individuals is a carrier of the founder mutation. The causal gene is solute carrier family 12 member 6 (SLC12A6) located on chromosome band 15q14. It encodes the potassium-chloride cotransporter 3 (KCC3). Two pathogenic variants have been found in French-Canadians: c.2436delG (p. Thr813Profs) (161/162 alleles) and c.1584–1585delCTinsG (Phe529fsX531). No treatments are currently available. As the disease progresses, orthoses for upper and lower limbs and physiotherapy are beneficial to prevent contractures. Early developmental and educational intervention addresses cognitive delays. Neuroleptics may be used to treat psychiatric manifestations.

### Agenesis of the corpus callosum: Classifying functional manifestations with the ICF-CY [^1171bvgD]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2014). Low credibility.

Agenesis of the corpus callosum (ACC) is a congenital condition where the corpus callosum fails to develop fully. In the literature, ACC has been broadly conceptualized and inconsistently described. This article demonstrates how the universal language of the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health-Children and Youth (ICF-CY) can increase the specificity with which researchers and clinicians describe the variable manifestations of ACC.

- **Methods**: The database for this article was based on a review of 83 studies on developmental and neuropsychological manifestations of congenital ACC in children and adolescents. First, the extent to which the findings on ACC could be documented using the taxonomic codes in the ICF-CY was examined. Next, the findings from each study were mapped onto the ICF-CY to summarize the distribution of clinical features reported in the literature.

- **Results**: There was a high degree of correspondence between the reported findings and the taxonomic codes of the ICF-CY. The distribution of clinical features was discussed.

- **Conclusions**: This taxonomic application advances the ICF-CY as a common language for researchers and clinicians working with children who have ACC. The implications for rehabilitation indicate that the variable clinical manifestations of children with ACC can be most effectively described using the ICF-CY.

The application of the ICF-CY to conditions with highly variable clinical manifestations enhances communication and understanding among professionals.

### Partial agenesis and hypoplasia of the corpus callosum in idiopathic autism [^113dmAAH]. Journal of Neuropathology and Experimental Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

To test the hypothesis that developmental anomalies of the corpus callosum (CC) contribute to the pathogenesis of autism, we characterized the type, topography, and severity of CC pathology corresponding to reduced CC areas detected by magnetic resonance imaging in the brains of 11 individuals with autism and 11 controls. In the brains of 3 autistic subjects, partial CC agenesis resulted in a complete or partial lack of interhemispheric axonal connections in CC segments III-V. In these cases, a combination of focal agenesis and uniform axonal deficit caused a reduction of CC areas by 37%, of axon numbers by 62%, and of the numerical density of axons by 39%.

In the CC of 8 autistic subjects without agenesis, there was an 18% deficit of the midsagittal CC area, a 48.4% deficit of axon numbers, and a 37% reduction of the numerical density of axons. The significantly thinner CC, reduced CC area, and uniform axonal deficit in all autistic subjects were classified as CC hypoplasia. Thus, the byproduct of partial CC agenesis and hypoplasia is the reduction of axonal connections between cortical areas known to be involved in behavioral alterations observed in people with autism.

### How should antenatal counseling be given to parents in the fetal corpus callosum agenesis [^111XujAf]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Low credibility.

We aimed to review the corpus callosum agenesis (CCA) cases diagnosed and managed in our university to contribute to the literature about this antenatally diagnosed fetal cranial anomaly by revealing the antenatal and postnatal outcomes of CCA.

- **Methods**: This retrospective and cross-sectional study examined CCA detected in our clinic between 2012 and 2021. Genetic results, accompanying additional anomalies, termination, and perinatal mortality rates were also calculated. Neurodevelopmental outcomes were revealed by investigating motor development, cognitive development, behavioral disorder, speech delay, personal-social backwardness, and epilepsy in cases of isolated CCA and non-isolated CCA in the postnatal period.

- **Results**: Data from 30 fetuses were evaluated during the study. The number of isolated CCA and non-isolated CCA cases were 11 (37.5%) and 19 (62.5%), respectively, and the number of partial CCA and complete CCA cases were 8 (26%) and 22 (74%), respectively. Among the 30 fetuses, the numbers of live births, chromosomal anomalies, perinatal mortalities, and terminations were found to be 14 (47%), 3 (10%), 3 (10%), and 13 (43%), respectively. Postnatal evaluation was performed in 14 children, and normal neurodevelopmental outcomes were observed in 5 (35.7%). All these children were from the isolated CCA group. Additionally, a poor neurodevelopmental outcome was detected in 37.5% of isolated CCA.

- **Conclusion**: If CCA is detected in the fetus, additional ultrasonographic anomaly and genetic examination should be performed to differentiate isolated CCA from non-isolated cases.

### Clinical outcomes following prenatal diagnosis of asymmetric ventriculomegaly, interhemispheric cyst, and callosal dysgenesis (AVID) [^117PaFfG]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2019). Low credibility.

When identified prenatally, the imaging triad of asymmetric ventriculomegaly, interhemispheric cyst, and dysgenesis of the corpus callosum (AVID) can indicate a more serious congenital brain anomaly. In this follow-up series of 15 fetuses, we present the neurodevelopmental outcomes of a single institution cohort of children diagnosed prenatally with AVID.

Our fetal ultrasound database was queried for cases of AVID between 2000 and 2016. All available fetal MR imaging studies were reviewed for the presence of (a) interhemispheric cysts or ventricular diverticula and (b) dysgenesis or agenesis of the corpus callosum. Clinical records were reviewed for perinatal management, postnatal surgical management, and neurodevelopmental outcomes.

Fifteen prenatal cases of AVID were identified. Twelve were live-born, and three pregnancies were terminated. Of the 12 patients, 11 underwent neurosurgical intervention. Of the eight patients surviving past infancy, seven have moderate to severe neurodevelopmental delays or disabilities, encompassing both motor and language skills, and all have variable visual abnormalities.

In our cohort of 15 prenatally diagnosed fetuses with AVID, eight survived past infancy, and all have neurodevelopmental disabilities, including motor and language deficits, a wide range of visual defects, craniofacial abnormalities, and medical comorbidities.

### Corpus callosum long-term biometry in very preterm children related to cognitive and motor outcomes [^114rfXC2]. Pediatric Research (2024). High credibility.

The corpus callosum (CC) is suggested as an indirect biomarker of white matter volume, which is often affected by preterm birth. However, diagnosing mild white matter injury is challenging.

- **Methods**: We studied 124 children born preterm (mean age: 8.4 ± 1.1 years), using MRI to assess CC measurements and cognitive/motor outcomes based on the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-V (WPPSI-V) and Movement Assessment Battery for Children-2 (MABC-2).

- **Results**: Children with normal outcomes exhibited greater height (10.2 ± 2.1 mm vs. 9.4 ± 2.3 mm; p = 0.01), fractional anisotropy at the splenium (895[680–1000] vs. 860.5[342–1000]), and total CC length (69.1 ± 4.8 mm vs. 67.3 ± 5.1 mm; p = 0.02) compared to those with adverse outcomes. All measured CC areas were smaller in the adverse outcome group. Models incorporating posterior CC measurements demonstrated the highest specificity (83.3% Sp, AUC: 0.65) for predicting neurological outcomes. CC length and splenium height were the only linear measurements associated with manual dexterity and total MABC-2 score, while both the latter and genu were related to Full-Scale Intelligence Quotient.

- **Conclusions**: CC biometry in children born very preterm at school age is associated with outcomes and exhibits a specific subregion alteration pattern. The posterior CC may serve as an important neurodevelopmental biomarker in very preterm infants.

- **Impact**: The corpus callosum has the potential to serve as a reliable and easily measurable biomarker of white matter integrity in very preterm children. Estimating diffuse white matter i

### Outcome of prenatally diagnosed agenesis of the corpus callosum [^115LyFvC]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2007). Low credibility.

To investigate the natural history, associated abnormalities, and outcomes in fetuses diagnosed prenatally with agenesis of the corpus callosum (ACC), a retrospective study was conducted. This study included all cases of prenatally detected ACC in patients referred to two tertiary units between January 1993 and October 2003. Associated abnormalities, pregnancy outcomes, and infant follow-up were recorded.

ACC was diagnosed in 117 cases. In 82 (70%) cases, it was associated with other fetal structural (n = 49) or chromosomal abnormalities (n = 33). ACC was classified as an isolated prenatal finding in 35 (30%) cases. Assuming normal development in all cases lost to follow-up, significant developmental delay was present in 36% (95% CI, 15–65%) of isolated ACC cases. Furthermore, developmental delay was present in all cases with ventriculomegaly of at least 15 mm and in one of four cases with ventricular measurements less than 15 mm.

The outcome of prenatally detected ACC is mainly dependent on the presence or absence of associated anomalies. Full assessment of fetal ACC mandates karyotyping, MRI, and a search for more subtle ultrasound features of certain genetic syndromes. In this series, at least 36% (95% CI, 15–65%) of cases with isolated ACC exhibited significant developmental delay when assessed postnatally.

### Agenesis of corpus callosum: A clinical study of complete versus partial agenesis in a 20-year retrospective cohort [^115PwfA1]. Journal of Child Neurology (2025). Low credibility.

Agenesis of the corpus callosum (ACC) has a wide spectrum of anatomic manifestations associated with incompletely understood clinical variability. In this retrospective cohort study, 161 children with ACC were classified into complete ACC and partial ACC. Partial and complete ACC diagnoses were confirmed by postnatal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and further classified as isolated or complex (associated with other brain abnormalities or genetic diagnoses). Clinical characteristics, clinical outcomes, and co-occurring genetic variations were collected by chart review. Median age at last neurologic evaluation for the complete and partial ACC cohorts were 2.8 years and 2.3 years, respectively; thus, an average of 2–3 years of follow-up data were analyzed per patient.

Results showed that children with complete and partial ACC had similar birth characteristics. Children with complete ACC were more frequently diagnosed prenatally; additionally, complete ACC patients had lower rates of cerebral palsy. When comparing complex complete ACC and complex partial ACC to isolated complete ACC and isolated partial ACC, respectively, the complex subcohorts had a higher level of motor delay, assistive device use, cerebral palsy, ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement, epilepsy, language delay, and cognitive delay than the isolated subcohorts. About 50% of children had genetic variants associated with neurodevelopmental disorders in this cohort. Additionally, more than 50% of our patients with motor and nonmotor developmental delays, as well as more than 60% of patients that required assistive devices, had these conditions.

### How should antenatal counseling be given to parents in the fetal corpus callosum agenesis [^1154SQDM]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Low credibility.

Since prenatal and postnatal outcomes are poor in non-isolated CCA cases, termination of pregnancy may be recommended to the family. However, given the considerable heterogeneity in outcome measures, follow-up time, and neurodevelopmental tools used, extensive prospective studies are needed to determine the occurrence of neurodevelopmental morbidity in children with isolated CCA.

Our research had some limitations as a retrospective study. The fact that 26% of our CCA cases do not have pregnancy follow-up and the remaining 43% are terminated has significantly reduced the number of our cases. In addition, since neurodevelopmental evaluation varies according to age, postnatal results may not fully reflect neurodevelopmental delay. The main limitations are that genetic testing is limited, and patients' neurodevelopmental status may vary depending on prenatal CCA as well as treatment, education, environmental factors, and family structure.

The strength of our study is that all patients in the CCA series were diagnosed prenatally and were managed by a multidisciplinary team during pregnancy and postpartum.

### Agenesis of the corpus callosum: Clinical and genetic study in 63 young patients [^115RxEqE]. Pediatric Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

This study reports the clinical features of 63 patients with agenesis of the corpus callosum who received in-depth genetic, clinical, and laboratory testing with the aim to contribute to a better description of the large spectrum of associated malformations and to assist clinicians in the diagnosis. Thirty patients manifested complete agenesis, and 33 patients displayed partial agenesis. Other associated nervous system malformations were detected in 14 patients with partial agenesis of the corpus callosum, mostly correlated to posterior fossa malformations, and in 10 patients with complete agenesis, more frequently associated with malformations of cortical development. Involvement of organs and apparatus other than the nervous system was present in 41 patients, ascribed to known syndromes in 21 cases. Cytogenetically detectable chromosomal abnormalities were found in 7 patients, and subtelomeric rearrangements were found in 3 patients. Neuromotor skills were impaired in almost all cases (58/63). Mental retardation of different severity was present in 52 cases, whereas 2 patients were borderline, and 9 patients had a normal intelligence quotient. This study demonstrates that there is no unique prognosis for agenesis of the corpus callosum, as this condition is associated with a broad range of clinical manifestations, oscillating between the limits of the norm and severe psychomotor delay.

Corpus callosum anomalies

An isolated corpus callosum abnormality is the most frequently diagnosed anomaly in fetal imaging. Given the increased risk of adverse neurologic outcomes, complete or partial agenesis of the corpus callosum is important to recognize. When the corpus callosum is severely dysplastic or virtually absent, attention must be paid to the status of the other commissures, as they may also be abnormal or absent.

Callosal absence and cavum septum pellucidum absence (normally visible from 16 gestational weeks on ultrasound and by 20 gestational weeks on MRI) are usually appreciable in the sagittal plane and should be confirmed in the coronal plane. The coronal plane is also useful in distinguishing callosal agenesis with an ectopic hippocampal commissure at its embryologic origin from hypogenesis/dysgenesis. Additional suggestive signs include elevation of the roof of the third ventricle, colpocephaly with a teardrop appearance, 'steer horn configuration' of the frontal horns on coronal imaging due to non-crossing white matter bundles (Probst bundles), or an abnormally radiating orientation of the median gyri and sulci relative to a possibly high-riding, interhemispherically extending third ventricle on sagittal imaging accentuated by the associated malrotation of the cingulate gyri.

In cases of partial agenesis, the posterior portion is often deficient due to an arrest in development. Corpus callosum abnormalities may be associated with other structural midline abnormalities causing a barrier to commissuration, such as interhemispheric cysts and lipomas, or, as stated previously, with malformations of cortical development (MCD).

### Agenesis of the corpus callosum with interhemispheric cyst: Clinical implications and outcome [^115cFWn4]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

We describe two cases of agenesis of the corpus callosum (ACC) with interhemispheric cyst (IHC).

- **Case 1**: A male infant was born at 36 weeks of gestation, with a history of second trimester fetal ultrasound (US) scan and MRI showing ACC with IHC. His head circumference at birth and at 5 months of age was at the 90th percentile. He developed infantile spasms, and an electroencephalogram showed hypsarrhythmia at 5 months of age. Seizures were controlled. He is under evaluation for surgical treatment.

- **Case 2**: ACC with a midline cyst was reported in the mid-trimester US scan of a male infant. Subsequent fetal scans showed an increasing size of the cyst. At birth, he had macrocephaly, with a head circumference above the 97th percentile. MRI of the brain confirmed ACC with IHC. The parents refused a cystoperitoneal shunt offered. The child displayed gross neurodevelopmental delay with progressive hydrocephalus on follow-up and succumbed to aspiration pneumonia at 22 months of age.

### Spectrum of corpus callosum agenesis [^115ZvCbh]. Pediatric Neurology (2005). Low credibility.

Magnetic resonance imaging and clinical features of 16 children with agenesis of the corpus callosum are reviewed. The patients were classified into three groups. Eight children had agenesis of the corpus callosum without substantial involvement of other brain areas. This group included patients with interhemispheric cyst, lipoma, or partial agenesis (hypogenesis) of the corpus callosum. Four patients in the second group manifested severe telencephalic dysgenesis in addition to agenesis of the corpus callosum. In the third group, agenesis of the corpus callosum was a component of a syndrome in four children. The outcome was not favorable for the majority of patients, even in the first group without significant involvement of other systems. Severe handicaps with developmental delay, intellectual disability, and neurologic deficit were observed in patients with additional telencephalic dysgenesis or syndromic form of corpus callosum agenesis.

### Callosal agenesis and congenital mirror movements: Outcomes associated with DCC mutations [^117VmAkK]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2020). Low credibility.

Pathogenic variants in the gene encoding deleted in colorectal cancer (DCC) are the first genetic cause of isolated agenesis of the corpus callosum (ACC). Here we present the detailed neurological, brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and neuropsychological characteristics of 12 individuals from three families with pathogenic variants in DCC (aged 8–50 years) who showed either ACC and mirror movements (n = 5), mirror movements only (n = 2), ACC only (n = 3), or neither ACC nor mirror movements (n = 2). There was heterogeneity in the neurological and neuroimaging features on brain MRI, and performance across neuropsychological domains ranged from extremely low (impaired) to within normal limits (average). Our findings show that ACC and/or mirror movements are associated with low functioning in select neuropsychological domains, and a DCC pathogenic variant alone is not sufficient to explain the disability.

- **What this paper adds**: Neuropsychological impairment severity is related to the presence of mirror movements and/or agenesis of the corpus callosum. A DCC pathogenic variant in isolation is associated with the best prognosis.

### Outcome of partial agenesis of corpus callosum [^114ggksp]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2024). High credibility.

The diagnosis of corpus callosum anomalies by prenatal ultrasound has improved over the last decade because of enhanced imaging techniques, scanning skills, and the routine implementation of transvaginal neurosonography.

- **Objective**: Our aim was to investigate all cases of incomplete agenesis of the corpus callosum and to report the sonographic characteristics, the associated anomalies, and the perinatal outcomes.

- **Study design**: We performed a retrospective analysis of cases from January 2007 to December 2017 with corpus callosum anomalies, either referred for a second opinion or derived from the prenatal ultrasound screening program in a single tertiary referral center. Cases with complete agenesis were excluded from the analysis. The standardized investigation included a detailed fetal ultrasound with neurosonogram, fetal karyotyping (standard karyotype or array comparative genomic hybridization), and fetal magnetic resonance imaging. The pregnancy outcome was collected, and pathologic investigation in cases of termination of the pregnancy or fetal or neonatal loss was compared with the prenatal findings. The pregnancy and fetal or neonatal outcomes were reported. The neurologic assessment was conducted by a pediatric neurologist using the Bayley Scales of Infant Development-II and the standardized Child Development Inventory when the Bayley investigation was unavailable.

- **Results**: Corpus callosum anomalies were diagnosed in 148 cases during the study period, 62 (41.9%) of which were excluded because of complete agenesis. Eighty-six fetuses had partial agenesis.

### Outcome of agenesis of the corpus callosum diagnosed by fetal MRI [^11129fxu]. Pediatric Neurology (2022). Low credibility.

Fetal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is increasingly utilized for the prenatal diagnosis of agenesis of the corpus callosum (ACC). This study aimed to: (1) describe cases of ACC diagnosed by fetal MRI; (2) determine the frequency of postnatal confirmation by MRI; and (3) understand postnatal outcomes of infants with ACC.

- **Methods**: Maternal records from Children's National Hospital between January 2012 and June 2019, with prenatal neurological consultation, fetal MRI, and ACC on imaging, were included. Maternal, prenatal, and postnatal infant data were collected. Each case was categorized as complete or partial ACC and isolated or complex ACC by fetal MRI, and group comparisons of outcomes were analyzed.

- **Results**: A total of 127 maternal-fetal dyads with ACC were categorized into 45 isolated-complete, 17 isolated-partial, 46 complex-complete, and 19 complex-partial ACC. Of 75 live births, 72 had postnatal evaluations. In 43 of 59 (73%) cases with postnatal neuroimaging, the prenatal ACC subcategory was confirmed. Children with isolated or complex, and with partial or complete ACC, had similar rates of developmental delays and epilepsy. Complex ACC cases had worse outcomes than isolated ACC, with complex ACC having more postnatal dysmorphisms and abnormal feeding and vision compared with isolated ACC. Similar neurodevelopmental outcomes were seen for partial and complete ACC.

- **Conclusions**: Children with isolated or complex ACC, and with partial or complete ACC, have a range of neurodevelopmental outcomes. Fetal and postnatal brain MRI is a valuable tool to understand different outcomes.

### Clinical characterization, genetics, and long-term follow-up of a large cohort of patients with agenesis of the corpus callosum [^114RcKZv]. Journal of Child Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

To gain a better understanding of the clinical and genetic features associated with agenesis of the corpus callosum, we enrolled and characterized 162 patients with complete or partial agenesis of the corpus callosum. Clinical and genetic protocols allowed us to categorize patients as syndromic subjects, affected by complex extra-brain malformations, and nonsyndromic subjects without any additional anomalies. We observed slight differences in sex ratio (56% males) and agenesis type (52% complete). Syndromic agenesis of the corpus callosum subjects were prevalent (69%). We detected associated cerebral malformations in 48% of patients. Neuromotor impairment, cognitive and language disorders, and epilepsy were frequently present, regardless of the agenesis of the corpus callosum subtype. Long-term follow-up allowed us to define additional indicators: syndromic agenesis of the corpus callosum plus patients showed the most severe clinical features, while isolated complete agenesis of the corpus callosum patients had the mildest symptoms, although we observed intellectual disability (64%) and epilepsy (15%) in both categories. We achieved a definitive (clinical and/or genetic) diagnosis in 42% of subjects.
