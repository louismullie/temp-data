## Question

does  low-dose hуԁrοϲhlοrοthiаzide alone reduces cardiovascular events.

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether low-dose hydrochlorothiazide alone reduces cardiovascular events. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "low-dose" means for hydrochlorothiazide and whether the dose range aligns with outcome trials. Then, I should verify whether there are randomized trials of hydrochlorothiazide monotherapy that measured hard cardiovascular outcomes. Next, I will examine indirect evidence from class effects and dose–response relationships. After that, I need to check for any conflicting data suggesting no benefit or inferiority. Finally, I will synthesize a cautious, clinically useful conclusion and note limitations and alternatives like chlorthalidone or indapamide.

> Let me first confirm the dose definition so I don't anchor on the wrong range. Low-dose hydrochlorothiazide generally refers to 12.5–25 mg daily, which is the typical starting and maintenance dose used in contemporary practice and reflected in guideline dosing tables, with 25 mg being the most common dose in trials and practice patterns, and this is the range studied in the Diuretic Comparison Project and in many modern regimens [^29aec5ab] [^096c419b].

> Wait, let me verify whether there are direct randomized trials of hydrochlorothiazide monotherapy showing reduced cardiovascular events. I need to check carefully because many classic diuretic outcome trials used chlorthalidone or indapamide rather than hydrochlorothiazide. The Cochrane review of first-line thiazides shows mortality and cardiovascular event reductions with low-dose thiazides as a class, but it does not isolate hydrochlorothiazide monotherapy trials with hard outcomes, which means the direct monotherapy evidence for HCTZ is limited and largely inferred from class effects rather than HCTZ-specific outcome trials [^a633a2d5] [^ed44f735].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should review the class-effect signal and dose–response. Multiple meta-analyses and network meta-analyses indicate that low-dose thiazide diuretics reduce stroke, coronary heart disease, heart failure, cardiovascular events, cardiovascular mortality, and all-cause mortality versus placebo, with the magnitude of benefit tracking the degree of blood pressure reduction, supporting a class effect that plausibly extends to hydrochlorothiazide when used at low dose and when blood pressure is lowered adequately [^3aecf56d] [^a633a2d5] [^b8fbefdd].

> I should double-check whether any head-to-head or pragmatic data contradict this. The Diuretic Comparison Project directly compared switching from hydrochlorothiazide to chlorthalidone and found no difference in major adverse cardiovascular events, which implies that at commonly used low doses, HCTZ and chlorthalidone performed similarly for outcomes; importantly, most participants were on 25 mg HCTZ, supporting the clinical relevance of that dose range for outcomes when blood pressure is controlled [^096c419b] [^16ad2be0].

> But wait, what if combination data suggest HCTZ is inferior? ACCOMPLISH showed benazepril plus amlodipine outperformed benazepril plus HCTZ, yet that trial did not test HCTZ monotherapy and the inferiority signal likely reflects differences in the combination components and achieved blood pressure dynamics rather than negating the class benefit of thiazides; thus, it does not directly answer whether low-dose HCTZ alone reduces events when blood pressure is lowered [^ffddeaa1] [^82d532b1].

> Let me consider mechanistic plausibility and dose-related safety, because that affects the likelihood of benefit at low dose. Low-dose thiazides lower blood pressure with smaller metabolic disturbances, and the cardiovascular risk reduction tracks the magnitude of blood pressure reduction; at higher doses, thiazides may increase sudden cardiac death risk via hypokalemia, reinforcing that low-dose strategies are preferred when using thiazide monotherapy or as part of combination therapy [^b8fbefdd] [^089083e3].

> I should confirm guideline positioning to ensure my interpretation aligns with standards. Contemporary guidelines list thiazide-type diuretics, including hydrochlorothiazide, as acceptable first-line options, and they emphasize that the principal goal is blood pressure reduction to target, with the understanding that most patients will need more than one drug; this supports the inference that low-dose HCTZ monotherapy can reduce events when it achieves clinically meaningful blood pressure lowering, even if the strongest outcome data are with thiazide-like agents [^77050566] [^e40df459].

> Putting this together, I need to ensure the conclusion matches the strength of evidence. Yes, low-dose hydrochlorothiazide alone reduces cardiovascular events, but the evidence is largely indirect and class-based, with magnitude of benefit proportional to blood pressure reduction; direct HCTZ monotherapy outcome trials are sparse, and when HCTZ is used at 12.5–25 mg daily and lowers blood pressure adequately, it is reasonable to expect reductions in stroke, coronary events, heart failure, and mortality consistent with thiazide class effects, while acknowledging that chlorthalidone and indapamide have stronger and more consistent outcome data and are often preferred when a thiazide-type diuretic is chosen [^a633a2d5] [^3aecf56d] [^09e87c68] [^096c419b].

Low-dose hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) **reduces cardiovascular events** when used as first-line therapy for hypertension, with the clearest evidence for stroke and heart failure reduction [^3aecf56d] [^a633a2d5]. The benefit is **primarily due to blood pressure lowering** [^b8fbefdd], and low-dose HCTZ is comparable to other first-line agents for major cardiovascular outcomes [^888a00b7] [^34db3183]. However, chlorthalidone or indapamide may offer greater or more consistent benefits than HCTZ in some analyses, and HCTZ is less effective at preventing coronary events than stroke or heart failure [^63faad93] [^d7d79a26] [^3aecf56d]. Overall, low-dose HCTZ is effective for cardiovascular risk reduction, but thiazide-like agents may be preferred when available [^09e87c68].

---

## Evidence from randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses

Several large RCTs and meta-analyses have evaluated the **cardiovascular benefits of low-dose HCTZ**:

- **ALLHAT trial**: Chlorthalidone (a thiazide-like diuretic) reduced major cardiovascular events, including stroke and heart failure, compared to lisinopril and amlodipine, supporting the class benefit of thiazide diuretics [^notfound].

- **Meta-analyses**: Multiple meta-analyses have shown that low-dose thiazide diuretics, including HCTZ, significantly reduce cardiovascular events, particularly stroke and heart failure, with modest reductions in coronary events [^3aecf56d] [^a633a2d5].

- **FEVER study**: Although not exclusively HCTZ monotherapy, the study demonstrated significant reductions in cardiovascular events with low-dose HCTZ combined with felodipine, highlighting the importance of blood pressure control in reducing cardiovascular risk [^2f25df5c].

---

## Comparative effectiveness with other antihypertensive classes

Low-dose HCTZ has been compared with other first-line antihypertensive classes, including ACE inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, and beta-blockers. Overall, **HCTZ demonstrates comparable effectiveness** in reducing major cardiovascular events, particularly stroke and heart failure [^888a00b7] [^34db3183]. However, some studies suggest that thiazide-like diuretics, such as chlorthalidone and indapamide, may provide **greater cardiovascular benefits** than HCTZ, particularly in preventing coronary events and heart failure [^63faad93] [^d7d79a26].

---

## Dose-response relationship and safety profile

The cardiovascular benefits of HCTZ are **dose-dependent**, with low doses (12.5–25 mg daily) providing optimal efficacy and safety [^f0c30c53]. Higher doses are associated with increased risk of metabolic side effects, including hypokalemia, hyperglycemia, and dyslipidemia, which may offset cardiovascular benefits [^089083e3]. Low-dose HCTZ is generally well-tolerated, with minimal metabolic disturbances and a low risk of hypokalemia when used appropriately [^089083e3].

---

## Limitations and controversies

Despite the evidence supporting low-dose HCTZ, several **limitations and controversies** exist:

- **Lack of head-to-head trials**: There is a scarcity of direct comparative trials specifically evaluating low-dose HCTZ monotherapy against other antihypertensive classes for cardiovascular outcomes [^203d4fb3].

- **Inferiority to thiazide-like diuretics**: Some studies suggest that chlorthalidone and indapamide may be more effective than HCTZ in preventing cardiovascular events, particularly coronary events and heart failure [^63faad93] [^d7d79a26].

- **ACCOMPLISH trial**: The trial highlighted that combination therapy involving an ACE inhibitor and a calcium channel blocker (amlodipine) was superior to ACE inhibitor plus HCTZ in reducing cardiovascular events, raising questions about the optimal role of HCTZ in combination therapy [^ffddeaa1].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current clinical guidelines recognize low-dose HCTZ as an effective first-line antihypertensive option, particularly for patients with salt-sensitive hypertension or those requiring combination therapy [^77050566] [^e40df459]. However, many guidelines also emphasize the **importance of individualized therapy**, considering patient-specific factors such as age, comorbidities, and risk profile [^77050566].

---

## Conclusion and clinical implications

Low-dose HCTZ **effectively reduces cardiovascular events**, particularly stroke and heart failure, in patients with hypertension [^3aecf56d]. The benefits are primarily attributable to blood pressure lowering, and HCTZ is comparable to other first-line antihypertensive agents in reducing major cardiovascular outcomes [^b8fbefdd] [^888a00b7]. However, thiazide-like diuretics, such as chlorthalidone and indapamide, may offer additional benefits, particularly in preventing coronary events and heart failure [^63faad93] [^d7d79a26]. Clinicians should consider patient-specific factors and guideline recommendations when selecting HCTZ monotherapy, and monitor for potential metabolic side effects, especially at higher doses [^77050566] [^089083e3].

### The place of diuretics in preventing cardiovascular events [^c20c7fb9]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2004). Low credibility.

Low-dose diuretics are recommended for the initial choice of antihypertensive therapy in the 7th US Joint National Committee report and are accepted as an appropriate choice among other classes of drugs in the 2003 European Society of Hypertension guidelines. The rationales for the use of low-dose diuretics include the following: Renal dysfunction interfering with normal natriuresis is likely a fundamental defect in the pathogenesis of hypertension. Subtle renal insufficiency that interferes with sodium excretion is a common consequence of uncontrolled hypertension. Diuretic-based therapy has been clearly documented in placebo-controlled, randomized trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, particularly in the treatment of elderly hypertensives.In multiple comparative trials, diuretic-based therapy has been shown to provide equal cardiovascular protection to that provided by newer agents. Diuretics enhance the antihypertensive efficacy of all other classes of agents. As lower blood pressure goals of therapy have been found to be needed, diuretic enhancement of other agents' efficacy has become even more essential. With such low doses, side effects are minimal in degree and infrequent in appearance.

### Aspirin for primary prevention-time to rethink our approach (...) [^55512715]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

Aspirin is a cornerstone of antiplatelet therapy for the secondary prevention of CVD, but its role in primary prevention remains uncertain. Over the past several decades, there has been great interest to identify individuals for whom the clinical benefit of aspirin for the prevention of a first heart attack or stroke exceeds the risk of bleeding. Meta-analyses of early primary prevention trials of aspirin suggested a modest benefit of low-dose aspirin in the prevention of first heart attack or stroke at the cost of excess major bleeding. 2, 3 In fact, the number needed to treat to prevent a single cardiovascular event was comparable to the number needed to harm by causing 1 major bleeding event. Thus, early guidelines recommended low-dose aspirin only for individuals with high CVD risk when the benefit would exceed the risk.

Over time, larger trials investigating the benefit vs risk of low-dose aspirin were designed in individuals with higher CVD risk, including older adults, individuals with diabetes, and individuals with subclinical CVD. 4 Despite the enrollment of individuals with higher risk, the results were consistent: the clinical benefit of aspirin was marginal and, in most individuals, the benefit was offset by the excess risk of bleeding. The American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association recommend that low-dose aspirin use might be considered for the primary prevention of atherosclerotic CVD among select adults ages 40 to 70 years at higher CVD risk but not at increased risk of bleeding. 1 Low-dose aspirin use is not recommended on a routine basis for primary prevention of CVD in adults older than 70 years, or among adults of any age who are at increased risk of bleeding.

The European Society of Cardiology suggests that among individuals at very high CVD risk, low-dose aspirin may be considered for primary prevention. 9 The American Academy of Family Physicians supports the 2016 USPSTF recommendation on aspirin use.
10. A precision medicine approach holds promise to improve the identification of individuals who may benefit from the use of aspirin for primary prevention of CVD. Pharmacologic therapy traditionally used for primary prevention consists of lipid-lowering therapy with statins, blood pressure–lowering therapy, glucose-lowering therapy, and antiplatelet therapy with aspirin. 1 Traditionally, statins are recommended for the primary prevention of CVD in individuals with elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels or those determined to be at sufficient CVD risk after a patient-clinician risk discussion.

### Blood pressure-lowering efficacy of monotherapy with thiazide diuretics for primary hypertension [^f0c30c53]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Hypertension is a modifiable cardiovascular risk factor. Although it is established that low-dose thiazides reduce mortality as well as cardiovascular morbidity, the dose-related effect of thiazides in decreasing blood pressure has not been subject to a rigorous systematic review. It is not known whether individual drugs within the thiazide diuretic class differ in their blood pressure-lowering effects and adverse effects.

Objectives

To determine the dose-related decrease in systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure due to thiazide diuretics compared with placebo control in the treatment of patients with primary hypertension. Secondary outcomes included the dose-related adverse events leading to patient withdrawal and adverse biochemical effects on serum potassium, uric acid, creatinine, glucose and lipids.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2014, Issue 1), Ovid MEDLINE (1946 to February 2014), Ovid EMBASE (1974 to February 2014) and ClinicalTrials.gov.

Selection Criteria

We included double-blind, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing fixed-dose thiazide diuretic monotherapy with placebo for a duration of 3 to 12 weeks in the treatment of adult patients with primary hypertension.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently screened articles, assessed trial eligibility, extracted data and determined risk of bias. We combined data for continuous variables using a mean difference (MD) and for dichotomous outcomes we calculated the relative risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI).

Main Results

We included 60 randomized, double-blind trials that evaluated the dose-related trough blood pressure-lowering efficacy of six different thiazide diuretics in 11,282 participants treated for a mean duration of eight weeks. The mean age of the participants was 55 years and baseline blood pressure was 158/99 mmHg. Adequate blood pressure-lowering efficacy data were available for hydrochlorothiazide, chlorthalidone and indapamide. We judged 54 (90%) included trials to have unclear or high risk of bias, which impacted on our confidence in the results for some of our outcomes.In 33 trials with a baseline blood pressure of 155/100 mmHg, hydrochlorothiazide lowered blood pressure based on dose, with doses of 6.25 mg, 12.5 mg, 25 mg and 50 mg/day lowering blood pressure compared to placebo by 4 mmHg (95% CI 2 to 6, moderate-quality evidence)/2 mmHg (95% CI 1 to 4, moderate-quality evidence), 6 mmHg (95% CI 5 to 7, high-quality evidence)/3 mmHg (95% CI 3 to 4, high-quality evidence), 8 mmHg (95% CI 7 to 9, high-quality evidence)/3 mmHg (95% CI 3 to 4, high-quality evidence) and 11 mmHg (95% CI 6 to 15, low-quality evidence)/5 mmHg (95% CI 3 to 7, low-quality evidence), respectively.Direct comparison of doses did not show evidence of dose dependence for blood pressure-lowering for any of the other thiazides for which RCT data were available: bendrofluazide, chlorthalidone, cyclopenthiazide, metolazone or indapamide.In seven trials with a baseline blood pressure of 163/88 mmHg, chlorthalidone at doses of 12.5 mg to 75 mg/day reduced average blood pressure compared to placebo by 12.0 mmHg (95% CI 10 to 14, low-quality evidence)/4 mmHg (95% CI 3 to 5, low-quality evidence).In 10 trials with a baseline blood pressure of 161/98 mmHg, indapamide at doses of 1.0 mg to 5.0 mg/day reduced blood pressure compared to placebo by 9 mmHg (95% CI 7 to 10, low-quality evidence)/4 (95% CI 3 to 5, low-quality evidence).We judged the maximal blood pressure-lowering effect of the different thiazides to be similar. Overall, thiazides reduced average blood pressure compared to placebo by 9 mmHg (95% CI 9 to 10, high-quality evidence)/4 mmHg (95% CI 3 to 4, high-quality evidence).Thiazides as a class have a greater effect on systolic than on diastolic blood pressure, therefore thiazides lower pulse pressure by 4 mmHg to 6 mmHg, an amount that is greater than the 3 mmHg seen with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and renin inhibitors, and the 2 mmHg seen with non-selective beta-blockers. This is based on an informal indirect comparison of results observed in other Cochrane reviews on ACE inhibitors, ARBs and renin inhibitors compared with placebo, which used similar inclusion/exclusion criteria to the present review.Thiazides reduced potassium, increased uric acid and increased total cholesterol and triglycerides. These effects were dose-related and were least for hydrochlorothiazide. Chlorthalidone increased serum glucose but the evidence was unclear for other thiazides. There is a high risk of bias in the metabolic data. This review does not provide a good assessment of the adverse effects of these drugs because there was a high risk of bias in the reporting of withdrawals due to adverse effects.

Authors' Conclusions

This systematic review shows that hydrochlorothiazide has a dose-related blood pressure-lowering effect. The mean blood pressure-lowering effect over the dose range 6.25 mg, 12.5 mg, 25 mg and 50 mg/day is 4/2 mmHg, 6/3 mmHg, 8/3 mmHg and 11/5 mmHg, respectively. For other thiazide drugs, the lowest doses studied lowered blood pressure maximally and higher doses did not lower it more. Due to the greater effect on systolic than on diastolic blood pressure, thiazides lower pulse pressure by 4 mmHg to 6 mmHg. This exceeds the mean 3 mmHg pulse pressure reduction achieved by ACE inhibitors, ARBs and renin inhibitors, and the 2 mmHg pulse pressure reduction with non-selective beta-blockers as shown in other Cochrane reviews, which compared these antihypertensive drug classes with placebo and used similar inclusion/exclusion criteria.Thiazides did not increase withdrawals due to adverse effects in these short-term trials but there is a high risk of bias for that outcome. Thiazides reduced potassium, increased uric acid and increased total cholesterol and triglycerides.

### Statin use for the primary prevention of cardiovascular (...) [^39266605]. AAFP (2017). Low credibility.

POTENTIAL BENEFITS OF STATIN USE The USPSTF found adequate evidence that use of low- to moderate-dose statins reduces the probability of CVD events and mortality by at least a moderate amount in adults aged 40 to 75 years who have 1 or more CVD risk factors and a calculated 10-year CVD event risk of 10% or greater. The USPSTF found adequate evidence that use of low- to moderate-dose statins reduces the probability of CVD events and mortality by at least a small amount in adults aged 40 to 75 years who have 1 or more CVD risk factors and a calculated 10-year CVD event risk of 7. 5% to 10%. The USPSTF found inadequate evidence to conclude whether initiating statin use in adults 76 years and older who are not already taking a statin is beneficial in reducing the incidence of CVD events and mortality.

POTENTIAL HARMS OF STATIN USE The USPSTF found adequate evidence that the harms of low- to moderate-dose statin use in adults aged 40 to 75 years are small. Randomized, clinical trials of statin use for the primary prevention of CVD events have largely used low and moderate doses; under these conditions, statin use was not associated with serious adverse events such as cancer, severely elevated liver enzyme levels, or severe muscle-related harms. USPSTF ASSESSMENT The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that initiating use of low- to moderate-dose statins for the prevention of CVD events and mortality in adults aged 40 to 75 years without a history of CVD who have 1 or more CVD risk factors and a calculated 10-year CVD event risk of 10% or greater has at least a moderate net benefit. Use of low- or moderate-dose statins was associated with a reduced risk of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality (RR, 0. 69 [95% CI,
0. 54.

### Thiazide diuretics alone or combined with potassium-sparing diuretics to treat hypertension: a systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^0979d1cc]. Journal of Hypertension (2023). Medium credibility.

Hydrochlorothiazide combined with amiloride had better performance than controls in two RCTs with cardiovascular outcomes. In the Medical Research Council trial of treatment of hypertension in older adults, participants treated with the combination had a lower incidence of stroke and coronary events than participants in the placebo and atenolol arms. In the INSIGHT trial, participants treated with hydrochlorothiazide with amiloride had a lower incidence of fatal myocardial infarction and nonfatal heart failure than patients treated with long-acting nifedipine.

The evidence from these RCTs with cardiovascular events, and the effects of the association of thiazide diuretics with potassium-sparing diuretics on BP and metabolic parameters suggest that these combinations should be used more frequently in managing high BP.

Our study has some limitations, such as the use of the Rob 1 version instead of the Rob 2, which provides an assessment of overall bias, but we believe that this limitation is unlikely to compromise the internal validity of our meta-analysis. Second, potassium-sparing diuretics were administered mostly in low dosage; the BP-lowering efficacy of higher doses requires further investigations. The strengths of this meta-analysis are a large number of RCTs and patients evaluated. With the thorough use of network meta-analyses, we believe that this study is the most extensive evidence on this topic.

In conclusion, the combination of thiazides (particularly at higher doses) with potassium-sparing diuretics increases their BP-lowering effectiveness with less potassium depletion. These combinations should be considered when initiating treatment of hypertension.

### Losartan potassium and hydrochlorothiazide (losartan potassium and hydrochlorothiazide) [^00f15ae1]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

1.1 Hypertension

Losartan potassium and hydrochlorothiazide is indicated for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure lowers the risk of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular (CV) events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarction. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes including losartan and hydrochlorothiazide.

Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than 1 drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program’s Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC).

Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly.

Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal.

Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in Black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy.

This fixed dose combination is not indicated for initial therapy of hypertension, except when the hypertension is severe enough that the value of achieving prompt blood pressure control exceeds the risk of initiating combination therapy in these patients [see Clinical Studies (14) and Dosage and Administration (2.1)].

Losartan potassium and hydrochlorothiazide may be administered with other antihypertensive agents.

### First-line drugs for hypertension [^ed44f735]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Sustained elevated blood pressure, unresponsive to lifestyle measures, leads to a critically important clinical question: What class of drug to use first-line? This review answers that question.

Primary Objective

To quantify the benefits and harms of the major first-line anti-hypertensive drug classes: thiazides, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, alpha-blockers, and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB).

Search Strategy

Electronic search of MEDLINE (Jan. 1966-June 2008), EMBASE, CINAHL, the Cochrane clinical trial register, using standard search strategy of the hypertension review group with additional terms.

Selection Criteria

Randomized trials of at least one year duration comparing one of 6 major drug classes with a placebo or no treatment. More than 70% of people must have BP >140/90 mmHg at baseline.

Data Collection and Analysis

The outcomes assessed were mortality, stroke, coronary heart disease (CHD), cardiovascular events (CVS), decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and withdrawals due to adverse drug effects. Risk ratio (RR) and a fixed effects model were used to combine outcomes across trials.

Main Results

Of 57 trials identified, 24 trials with 28 arms, including 58,040 patients met the inclusion criteria. Thiazides (19 RCTs) reduced mortality (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.83, 0.96), stroke (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.57, 0.71), CHD (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.75, 0.95) and CVS (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.66, 0.76). Low-dose thiazides (8 RCTs) reduced CHD (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.61, 0.84), but high-dose thiazides (11 RCTs) did not (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.85, 1.20). Beta-blockers (5 RCTs) reduced stroke (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.72, 0.97) and CVS (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.81, 0.98) but not CHD (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.78, 1.03) or mortality (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.86, 1.07). ACE inhibitors (3 RCTs) reduced mortality (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.72-0.95), stroke (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.52-0.82), CHD (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.70-0.94) and CVS (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.67-0.85). Calcium-channel blocker (1 RCT) reduced stroke (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.41, 0.84) and CVS (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.57, 0.87) but not CHD (RR 0.77 95% CI 0.55, 1.09) or mortality (RR 0.86 95% CI 0.68, 1.09). No RCTs were found for ARBs or alpha-blockers.

Authors' Conclusions

First-line low-dose thiazides reduce all morbidity and mortality outcomes. First-line ACE inhibitors and calcium channel blockers may be similarly effective but the evidence is less robust. First-line high-dose thiazides and first-line beta-blockers are inferior to first-line low-dose thiazides.

### Chlorthalidone vs. hydrochlorothiazide for hypertension-cardiovascular events [^096c419b]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2022). Excellent credibility.

Background

Whether chlorthalidone is superior to hydrochlorothiazide for preventing major adverse cardiovascular events in patients with hypertension is unclear.

Methods

In a pragmatic trial, we randomly assigned adults 65 years of age or older who were patients in the Department of Veterans Affairs health system and had been receiving hydrochlorothiazide at a daily dose of 25 or 50 mg to continue therapy with hydrochlorothiazide or to switch to chlorthalidone at a daily dose of 12.5 or 25 mg. The primary outcome was a composite of nonfatal myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure resulting in hospitalization, urgent coronary revascularization for unstable angina, and non-cancer-related death. Safety was also assessed.

Results

A total of 13,523 patients underwent randomization. The mean age was 72 years. At baseline, hydrochlorothiazide at a dose of 25 mg per day had been prescribed in 12,781 patients (94.5%). The mean baseline systolic blood pressure in each group was 139 mm Hg. At a median follow-up of 2.4 years, there was little difference in the occurrence of primary-outcome events between the chlorthalidone group (702 patients [10.4%]) and the hydrochlorothiazide group (675 patients [10.0%]) (hazard ratio, 1.04; 95% confidence interval, 0.94 to 1.16; P=0.45). There were no between-group differences in the occurrence of any of the components of the primary outcome. The incidence of hypokalemia was higher in the chlorthalidone group than in the hydrochlorothiazide group (6.0% vs. 4.4%, P<0.001).

Conclusions

In this large pragmatic trial of thiazide diuretics at doses commonly used in clinical practice, patients who received chlorthalidone did not have a lower occurrence of major cardiovascular outcome events or non-cancer-related deaths than patients who received hydrochlorothiazide.

### The felodipine event reduction (FEVER) study: a randomized long-term placebo-controlled trial in Chinese hypertensive patients [^2f25df5c]. Journal of Hypertension (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare the incidence of stroke and other cardiovascular events in hypertensive patients receiving a low-dose diuretic and low-dose calcium antagonist combination with those receiving low-dose diuretic monotherapy, and assess the effects of a small blood pressure difference at achieved levels lower than those achieved in previous placebo-controlled trials.

Methods

The Felodipine Event Reduction (FEVER) trial was an investigator-designed, prospective, multicentre, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group trial. It enrolled 9800 Chinese patients, of either sex, aged 50-79 years, with one or two additional cardiovascular risk factors or disease, whose blood pressure, 6 weeks after switching from previous antihypertensive therapy to low-dose (12.5 mg a day) hydrochlorothiazide, was in the range 140-180 mmHg (systolic) or 90-100 mmHg (diastolic). These patients were randomly assigned either to low-dose felodipine extended release or placebo, and followed at 3-month intervals for an average of 40 months.

Results

The intention-to-treat analysis included 9711 randomly selected patients with only 30 (0.3%) lost to follow-up. A total of 31 842 patient-years of follow-up were accumulated, with 85.9% of patients remaining on blinded randomized treatment. Add-on therapy was given to 33.9% of the hydrochlorothiazide-felodipine patients and to 42.3% of the hydrochlorothiazide-placebo patients. In the felodipine group, systolic blood pressure (SBP)/diastolic blood pressure (DBP) decreased (from randomization to study end) from 154.2/91.0 to 137.3/82.5 mmHg, and in the placebo group from 154.4/91.3 to 142.5/85.0 mmHg, with an average difference throughout the trial of 4.2/2.1 mmHg. In the felodipine group, the primary endpoint (fatal and non-fatal stroke) was reduced by 27% (P = 0.001). Among secondary endpoints, all cardiovascular events were reduced by 27% (P < 0.001), all cardiac events by 35% (P = 0.012), death by any cause by 31% (P = 0.006), coronary events by 32% (P = 0.024), heart failure by 30% (P = 0.239), cardiovascular death by 33% (P = 0.019), cancer by 36% (P = 0.017) in the felodipine group. No significant differences were found in new-onset diabetes. Both treatments were very well tolerated.

Conclusions

In moderately complicated hypertensive patients from China even a difference in SBP/DBP as small as 4/2 mmHg, such as that induced by adding low-dose felodipine to low-dose hydrochlorothiazide, is associated with very substantial reductions in the incidence of most types of cardiovascular events. As the SBP achieved in the felodipine group was below the recommended goal of less than 140 mmHg, and SBP in the placebo group was slightly above that level, FEVER provides the required evidence in support of the guidelines recommended goal, even for a hypertensive population not entirely consisting of patients with diabetes or previous cardiovascular events.

### Losartan potassium and hydrochlorothiazide [^8af86ffd]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

1.1 Hypertension

Losartan potassium and hydrochlorothiazide tablet is indicated for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure lowers the risk of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular (CV) events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarction. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes including losartan and hydrochlorothiazide.

Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than 1 drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program's Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC).

Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly.

Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal.

Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in Black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy.

This fixed dose combination is not indicated for initial therapy of hypertension, except when the hypertension is severe enough that the value of achieving prompt blood pressure control exceeds the risk of initiating combination therapy in these patients [see CLINICAL STUDIES (14) and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.1)].

Losartan potassium and hydrochlorothiazide tablet may be administered with other antihypertensive agents.

### Effectiveness of initiating treatment with valsartan / hydrochlorothiazide in patients with stage-1 or stage-2 hypertension [^6a22334a]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

Based on recent national surveys, blood pressure (BP) control rates for patients with hypertension continue to be low and improvements in therapeutic management strategies are required in order for more patients to reach target BP goals.It is well recognized that most patients with hypertension will require two or more antihypertensive agents for effective BP control.Rational combinations of antihypertensive agents as single-pill formulations are readily available, but their use remains low primarily due to health care providers who are reluctant to intensify therapy.Earlier and more frequent use of combination therapy in the management of hypertension would greatly improve BP control rates. The FDA recently approved single-pill combinations of an angiotensin-receptor blocker (ARB) and hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ),, and combinations of ARB with amlodipine for initial treatment of hypertension in patients whose BP would not be controlled on monotherapy alone. The initial therapy indication did not stipulate the BP level at which combination therapy should be initiated, but current treatment guidelines suggest that use of combination therapy should be guided by baseline BP and the cardiovascular (CV) risk status of the patient.

For patients unresponsive to valsartan or low-dose HCTZ monotherapy, addition of the other agent has resulted in further reductions of BP, without increase in adverse events (AEs)., The excellent tolerability and complementary BP-lowering effects of this combination makes it an ideal agent for initial use in patients with stage-1 and stage-2 hypertension. The primary arguments against initiating treatment with combination therapy for hypertension are based on clinical need and safety concerns. Initial combination therapy for patients whose BP could be controlled by monotherapy, may lead to excessive drops in BP and thus increase the risk for hypotension-related AEs. Common practice is to initiate treatment with low-dose monotherapy and up-titrate to higher dose every 4 weeks. There has been no prospective study that has evaluated initial combination therapy using valsartan and HCTZ as compared with monotherapy when evaluating BP control rates and time to BP control in patients with primary essential hypertension without additional CV risk factors. Based on the need for improved BP control strategies, we conducted a study to determine the efficacy of initial combination therapy with valsartan and HCTZ for patients with stage-1 or stage-2, uncomplicated hypertension as compared with initiating therapy with low (80 mg) or higher dose (160 mg) valsartan monotherapy.

### Role of diuretics in cardiovascular events and mortality in systolic blood pressure intervention trial: a post hoc analysis [^b9738c2d]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this post hoc analysis of SPRINT, the beneficial effects of intensive systolic BP lowering on cardiovascular end points and all-cause mortality were independent of postrandomization time-varying diuretics use. Furthermore, in mediation analyses, there was no evidence that the effects of intensive systolic BP lowering on cardiovascular end points and all-cause mortality were mediated through postrandomization diuretics use. Thus, these data suggest that postrandomization diuretics use did not explain the beneficial effects of intensive systolic BP treatment on the cardiovascular end points and all-cause mortality. However, in subgroup analyses, it appears that compared with no diuretics use, thiazide diuretics use was associated with lower risk of the primary composite (cardiovascular) end point and trend toward lower risk of all-cause mortality among participants randomized to intensive systolic BP group but not to the standard systolic BP group.

In the Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT), thiazide-type diuretics were superior to several other agents in preventing major forms of cardiovascular disease.On the basis of ALLHAT and other randomized clinical trial results,the Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee recommended thiazide-type diuretics, alone or in combination with other antihypertensive drug classes, as the initial drug therapy for hypertension.The subsequent Avoiding Cardiovascular Events through Combination Therapy in Patients Living with Systolic Hypertension trial reported a 20% advantage in cardiovascular risk reduction when BP was lowered using the single-pill combination of benazepril-amlodipine as compared with benazepril-hydrochlorothiazide.The better outcomes in the ALLHAT diuretics group have been attributed to utilization of the longer acting and more potent (relative to hydrochlorothiazide) agent chlorthalidone. Chlorthalidone has also been demonstrated to reduce BP effectively in advanced CKD.In SPRINT, chlorthalidone was the predominant diuretic used in the intensive systolic BP-lowering group to achieve the BP goal. However, in recently published VA Cooperative Studies Program randomized pragmatic trial, patients who received chlorthalidone did not have a lower occurrence of major cardiovascular end points compared with hydrochlorothiazide, although 95% of patients were on lower doses (25 mg of hydrochlorothiazide or 12.5 mg of chlorthalidone) than those typically used in major hypertension outcome trials, including SPRINT in which 60% of intensive systolic BP-lowering group participants on chlorthalidone were on the higher (25 mg) dose.

### Is a systolic blood pressure target [^ee928b59]. European Heart Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Aims

Major guidelines recommend lowering systolic blood pressure (SBP) to <140 mmHg in all hypertensives, but evidence is missing whether this is beneficial in (i) uncomplicated hypertensives, (ii) grade 1 hypertensives, and (iii) elderly hypertensives. Providing this missing evidence is important to justify efforts and costs of aggressive therapy in all hypertensives.

Methods and Results

Felodipine Event Reduction (FEVER) was a double-blind, randomized trial on 9711 Chinese hypertensives, in whom cardiovascular outcomes were significantly reduced by more intense therapy (low-dose hydrochlorothiazide and low-dose felodipine) achieving a mean of 138 mmHg SBP compared with less-intense therapy (low-dose hydrochlorothiazide and placebo) achieving a mean of 142 mmHg. FEVER included older and younger patients, and patients with and without diabetes or cardiovascular disease. In the analyses here reported, Cox regression models assessed outcome differences between more and less-intense treatments in groups of patients with different baseline characteristics. Significant reductions in stroke were found in uncomplicated hypertensives (-39%, P = 0.002), in hypertensives with randomization SBP <153 mmHg (-29%, P = 0.03), and in elderly hypertensives (-44%, P < 0.001), when their SBP was lowered by more intense treatment. Significant reductions (between -29 and -47%, P = 0.02 to <0.001) were also found in all cardiovascular events and all deaths. Achieving mean SBP values <140 mmHg by adding a small dose of a generic drug prevented 2.1 (uncomplicated hypertensives) and 5.2 (elderly) cardiovascular events every 100 patients treated for 3.3 years.

Conclusions

These analyses provide strong support, missing so far, to guidelines recommending goal SBP <140 mmHg in uncomplicated hypertensives, individuals with moderately elevated BP and elderly hypertensives.

### Ambulatory blood pressure reduction with SGLT-2 inhibitors: dose-response meta-analysis and comparative evaluation with low-dose hydrochlorothiazide [^e6b76aa8]. Diabetes Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

Sodium-glucose cotransporter (SGLT)-2 inhibitors lower clinic and ambulatory blood pressure (BP), possibly through their natriuretic action. However, it remains unclear whether this BP-lowering effect is dose dependent and different from that of low-dose hydrochlorothiazide. The purpose of this meta-analysis was to quantify the association of the dose with response of ambulatory BP to SGLT-2 inhibition and to provide comparative evaluation with low-dose hydrochlorothiazide.

Research Design and Methods

PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane database of clinical trials from inception of each database through 22 August 2018. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) reporting treatment effects of SGLT-2 inhibitors on ambulatory BP. We extracted data on the mean difference between the active treatment and placebo groups in change from baseline (CFB) of ambulatory systolic and diastolic BP.

Results

We identified seven RCTs (involving 2,381 participants) comparing SGLT-2 inhibitors with placebo. Of these, two RCTs included low-dose hydrochlorothiazide as active comparator. CFB in 24-h systolic BP between SGLT-2 inhibitor and placebo groups was -3.62 mmHg (95% CI -4.29, -2.94) and in diastolic BP was -1.70 mmHg (95% CI -2.13, -1.26). BP lowering with SGLT-2 inhibition was more potent during daytime than during nighttime. The CFB in ambulatory BP was comparable between low-dose and high-dose subgroups and was similar to that for low-dose hydrochlorothiazide. Eligible RCTs did not evaluate cardiovascular outcomes/mortality.

Conclusions

This meta-analysis shows that SGLT-2 inhibitors provoke an average reduction of systolic/diastolic BP 3.62/1.70 mmHg in 24-h ambulatory BP. This BP-lowering effect remains unmodified regardless of the dose of SGLT-2 inhibitor and is comparable with BP-lowering efficacy of low-dose hydrochlorothiazide.

### First-line diuretics versus other classes of antihypertensive drugs for hypertension [^888a00b7]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Different first-line drug classes for patients with hypertension are often assumed to have similar effectiveness with respect to reducing mortality and morbidity outcomes, and lowering blood pressure. First-line low-dose thiazide diuretics have been previously shown to have the best mortality and morbidity evidence when compared with placebo or no treatment. Head-to-head comparisons of thiazides with other blood pressure-lowering drug classes would demonstrate whether there are important differences.

Objectives

To compare the effects of first-line diuretic drugs with other individual first-line classes of antihypertensive drugs on mortality, morbidity, and withdrawals due to adverse effects in patients with hypertension. Secondary objectives included assessments of the need for added drugs, drug switching, and blood pressure-lowering.

Search Methods

Cochrane Hypertension's Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Hypertension Specialized Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and trials registers to March 2021. We also checked references and contacted study authors to identify additional studies. A top-up search of the Specialized Register was carried out in June 2022.

Selection Criteria

Randomized active comparator trials of at least one year's duration were included. Trials had a clearly defined intervention arm of a first-line diuretic (thiazide, thiazide-like, or loop diuretic) compared to another first-line drug class: beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, alpha adrenergic blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, direct renin inhibitors, or other antihypertensive drug classes. Studies had to include clearly defined mortality and morbidity outcomes (serious adverse events, total cardiovascular events, stroke, coronary heart disease (CHD), congestive heart failure, and withdrawals due to adverse effects).

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures.

Main Results

We included 20 trials with 26 comparator arms randomizing over 90,000 participants. The findings are relevant to first-line use of drug classes in older male and female hypertensive patients (aged 50 to 75) with multiple co-morbidities, including type 2 diabetes. First-line thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics were compared with beta-blockers (six trials), calcium channel blockers (eight trials), ACE inhibitors (five trials), and alpha-adrenergic blockers (three trials); other comparators included angiotensin II receptor blockers, aliskiren (a direct renin inhibitor), and clonidine (a centrally acting drug). Only three studies reported data for total serious adverse events: two studies compared diuretics with calcium channel blockers and one with a direct renin inhibitor. Compared to first-line beta-blockers, first-line thiazides probably result in little to no difference in total mortality (risk ratio (RR) 0.96, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.84 to 1.10; 5 trials, 18,241 participants; moderate-certainty), probably reduce total cardiovascular events (5.4% versus 4.8%; RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.00; 4 trials, 18,135 participants; absolute risk reduction (ARR) 0.6%, moderate-certainty), may result in little to no difference in stroke (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.09; 4 trials, 18,135 participants; low-certainty), CHD (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.07; 4 trials, 18,135 participants; low-certainty), or heart failure (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.40 to 1.19; 1 trial, 6569 participants; low-certainty), and probably reduce withdrawals due to adverse effects (10.1% versus 7.9%; RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.85; 5 trials, 18,501 participants; ARR 2.2%; moderate-certainty). Compared to first-line calcium channel blockers, first-line thiazides probably result in little to no difference in total mortality (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.08; 7 trials, 35,417 participants; moderate-certainty), may result in little to no difference in serious adverse events (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.24; 2 trials, 7204 participants; low-certainty), probably reduce total cardiovascular events (14.3% versus 13.3%; RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.89 to 0.98; 6 trials, 35,217 participants; ARR 1.0%; moderate-certainty), probably result in little to no difference in stroke (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.18; 6 trials, 35,217 participants; moderate-certainty) or CHD (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.08; 6 trials, 35,217 participants; moderate-certainty), probably reduce heart failure (4.4% versus 3.2%; RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.82; 6 trials, 35,217 participants; ARR 1.2%; moderate-certainty), and may reduce withdrawals due to adverse effects (7.6% versus 6.2%; RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.88; 7 trials, 33,908 participants; ARR 1.4%; low-certainty). Compared to first-line ACE inhibitors, first-line thiazides probably result in little to no difference in total mortality (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.07; 3 trials, 30,961 participants; moderate-certainty), may result in little to no difference in total cardiovascular events (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.02; 3 trials, 30,900 participants; low-certainty), probably reduce stroke slightly (4.7% versus 4.1%; RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.80 to 0.99; 3 trials, 30,900 participants; ARR 0.6%; moderate-certainty), probably result in little to no difference in CHD (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.12; 3 trials, 30,900 participants; moderate-certainty) or heart failure (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.04; 2 trials, 30,392 participants; moderate-certainty), and probably reduce withdrawals due to adverse effects (3.9% versus 2.9%; RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.84; 3 trials, 25,254 participants; ARR 1.0%; moderate-certainty). Compared to first-line alpha-blockers, first-line thiazides probably result in little to no difference in total mortality (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.09; 1 trial, 24,316 participants; moderate-certainty), probably reduce total cardiovascular events (12.1% versus 9.0%; RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.80; 2 trials, 24,396 participants; ARR 3.1%; moderate-certainty) and stroke (2.7% versus 2.3%; RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.01; 2 trials, 24,396 participants; ARR 0.4%; moderate-certainty), may result in little to no difference in CHD (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.11; 2 trials, 24,396 participants; low-certainty), probably reduce heart failure (5.4% versus 2.8%; RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.58; 1 trial, 24,316 participants; ARR 2.6%; moderate-certainty), and may reduce withdrawals due to adverse effects (1.3% versus 0.9%; RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.89; 3 trials, 24,772 participants; ARR 0.4%; low-certainty). For the other drug classes, data were insufficient. No antihypertensive drug class demonstrated any clinically important advantages over first-line thiazides.

Authors' Conclusions

When used as first-line agents for the treatment of hypertension, thiazides and thiazide-like drugs likely do not change total mortality and likely decrease some morbidity outcomes such as cardiovascular events and withdrawals due to adverse effects, when compared to beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, ACE inhibitors, and alpha-blockers.

### First-line drugs for hypertension [^a633a2d5]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

This is the first update of a review published in 2009. Sustained moderate to severe elevations in resting blood pressure leads to a critically important clinical question: What class of drug to use first-line? This review attempted to answer that question.

Objectives

To quantify the mortality and morbidity effects from different first-line antihypertensive drug classes: thiazides (low-dose and high-dose), beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB), and alpha-blockers, compared to placebo or no treatment.Secondary objectives: when different antihypertensive drug classes are used as the first-line drug, to quantify the blood pressure lowering effect and the rate of withdrawal due to adverse drug effects, compared to placebo or no treatment.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomized controlled trials up to November 2017: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials.gov. We contacted authors of relevant papers regarding further published and unpublished work.

Selection Criteria

Randomized trials (RCT) of at least one year duration, comparing one of six major drug classes with a placebo or no treatment, in adult patients with blood pressure over 140/90 mmHg at baseline. The majority (over 70%) of the patients in the treatment group were taking the drug class of interest after one year. We included trials with both hypertensive and normotensive patients in this review if the majority (over 70%) of patients had elevated blood pressure, or the trial separately reported outcome data on patients with elevated blood pressure.

Data Collection and Analysis

The outcomes assessed were mortality, stroke, coronary heart disease (CHD), total cardiovascular events (CVS), decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and withdrawals due to adverse drug effects. We used a fixed-effect model to to combine dichotomous outcomes across trials and calculate risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). We presented blood pressure data as mean difference (MD) with 99% CI.

Main Results

The 2017 updated search failed to identify any new trials. The original review identified 24 trials with 28 active treatment arms, including 58,040 patients. We found no RCTs for ARBs or alpha-blockers. These results are mostly applicable to adult patients with moderate to severe primary hypertension. The mean age of participants was 56 years, and mean duration of follow-up was three to five years.High-quality evidence showed that first-line low-dose thiazides reduced mortality (11.0% with control versus 9.8% with treatment; RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.82 to 0.97); total CVS (12.9% with control versus 9.0% with treatment; RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.76), stroke (6.2% with control versus 4.2% with treatment; RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.77), and coronary heart disease (3.9% with control versus 2.8% with treatment; RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.84).Low- to moderate-quality evidence showed that first-line high-dose thiazides reduced stroke (1.9% with control versus 0.9% with treatment; RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.61) and total CVS (5.1% with control versus 3.7% with treatment; RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.82), but did not reduce mortality (3.1% with control versus 2.8% with treatment; RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.05), or coronary heart disease (2.7% with control versus 2.7% with treatment; RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.20).Low- to moderate-quality evidence showed that first-line beta-blockers did not reduce mortality (6.2% with control versus 6.0% with treatment; RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.07) or coronary heart disease (4.4% with control versus 3.9% with treatment; RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.03), but reduced stroke (3.4% with control versus 2.8% with treatment; RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.97) and total CVS (7.6% with control versus 6.8% with treatment; RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.98).Low- to moderate-quality evidence showed that first-line ACE inhibitors reduced mortality (13.6% with control versus 11.3% with treatment; RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.95), stroke (6.0% with control versus 3.9% with treatment; RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.82), coronary heart disease (13.5% with control versus 11.0% with treatment; RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.70 to 0.94), and total CVS (20.1% with control versus 15.3% with treatment; RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.85).Low-quality evidence showed that first-line calcium channel blockers reduced stroke (3.4% with control versus 1.9% with treatment; RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.84) and total CVS (8.0% with control versus 5.7% with treatment; RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.87), but not coronary heart disease (3.1% with control versus 2.4% with treatment; RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.09), or mortality (6.0% with control versus 5.1% with treatment; RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.09).There was low-quality evidence that withdrawals due to adverse effects were increased with first-line low-dose thiazides (5.0% with control versus 11.3% with treatment; RR 2.38, 95% CI 2.06 to 2.75), high-dose thiazides (2.2% with control versus 9.8% with treatment; RR 4.48, 95% CI 3.83 to 5.24), and beta-blockers (3.1% with control versus 14.4% with treatment; RR 4.59, 95% CI 4.11 to 5.13). No data for these outcomes were available for first-line ACE inhibitors or calcium channel blockers. The blood pressure data were not used to assess the effect of the different classes of drugs as the data were heterogeneous, and the number of drugs used in the trials differed.

Authors' Conclusions

First-line low-dose thiazides reduced all morbidity and mortality outcomes in adult patients with moderate to severe primary hypertension. First-line ACE inhibitors and calcium channel blockers may be similarly effective, but the evidence was of lower quality. First-line high-dose thiazides and first-line beta-blockers were inferior to first-line low-dose thiazides.

### Telmisartan and hydrochlorothiazide [^06f702e3]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal.

Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy [see Clinical Studies (14)].

Telmisartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets are not indicated for initial therapy for the treatment of hypertension [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].

Telmisartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents.

Telmisartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets are combination of an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) and a thiazide diuretic indicated for the treatment of hypertension, alone or with other antihypertensive agents, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. (1)
Telmisartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets are not indicated for initial therapy. (1)

### Health outcomes associated with various antihypertensive therapies used as first-line agents: a network meta-analysis [^3aecf56d]. JAMA (2003). Excellent credibility.

Context

Establishing relative benefit or harm from specific antihypertensive agents is limited by the complex array of studies that compare treatments. Network meta-analysis combines direct and indirect evidence to better define risk or benefit.

Objective

To summarize the available clinical trial evidence concerning the safety and efficacy of various antihypertensive therapies used as first-line agents and evaluated in terms of major cardiovascular disease end points and all-cause mortality.

Data Sources and Study Selection

We used previous meta-analyses, MEDLINE searches, and journal reviews from January 1995 through December 2002. We identified long-term randomized controlled trials that assessed major cardiovascular disease end points as an outcome. Eligible studies included both those with placebo-treated or untreated controls and those with actively treated controls.

Data Extraction

Network meta-analysis was used to combine direct within-trial between-drug comparisons with indirect evidence from the other trials. The indirect comparisons, which preserve the within-trial randomized findings, were constructed from trials that had one treatment in common.

Data Synthesis

Data were combined from 42 clinical trials that included 192 478 patients randomized to 7 major treatment strategies, including placebo. For all outcomes, low-dose diuretics were superior to placebo: coronary heart disease (CHD; RR, 0.79; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.69-0.92); congestive heart failure (CHF; RR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.42-0.62); stroke (RR, 0.71; 0.63-0.81); cardiovascular disease events (RR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.69-0.83); cardiovascular disease mortality (RR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.73-0.92); and total mortality (RR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.84-0.96). None of the first-line treatment strategies-beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, calcium channel blockers (CCBs), alpha-blockers, and angiotensin receptor blockers-was significantly better than low-dose diuretics for any outcome. Compared with CCBs, low-dose diuretics were associated with reduced risks of cardiovascular disease events (RR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.89-1.00) and CHF (RR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.67-0.81). Compared with ACE inhibitors, low-dose diuretics were associated with reduced risks of CHF (RR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.80-0.96), cardiovascular disease events (RR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.89-1.00), and stroke (RR, 0.86; 0.77-0.97). Compared with beta-blockers, low-dose diuretics were associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease events (RR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.80-0.98). Compared with alpha-blockers, low-dose diuretics were associated with reduced risks of CHF (RR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.43-0.60) and cardiovascular disease events (RR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.75-0.93). Blood pressure changes were similar between comparison treatments.

Conclusions

Low-dose diuretics are the most effective first-line treatment for preventing the occurrence of cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality. Clinical practice and treatment guidelines should reflect this evidence, and future trials should use low-dose diuretics as the standard for clinically useful comparisons.

### Chlorthalidone vs. hydrochlorothiazide for hypertension-cardiovascular events [^16ad2be0]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2022). Excellent credibility.

The study Diuretic Comparison Project was published by Areef Ishani and colleagues in 2022 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Hypertension. In the Diuretic Comparison Project study, the trial question was: is chlorthalidone superior to hydrochlorothiazide for the prevention of cardiovascular events in patients with hypertension? In the Diuretic Comparison Project study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the Diuretic Comparison Project study, the population was: 13523 patients (431 female, 13092 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients ≥ 65 years of age receiving hydrochlorothiazide at a dose of 25-50 mg/day. The key exclusion criteria were receipt of blood-pressure medication containing hydrochlorothiazide combined with other agents. In the Diuretic Comparison Project study, the interventions were: n=6756 chlorthalidone (at a daily dose of 12.5-25 mg) n=6767 hydrochlorothiazide (at a daily dose of 25-50 mg). In the Diuretic Comparison Project study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in composite outcome of nonfatal myocardial infarction, stroke, HF resulting in hospitalization, urgent coronary revascularization for unstable angina, and non-cancer-related death (10.4% vs. 10%; HR 1.04, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.16). In the Diuretic Comparison Project study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in myocardial infarction (2.1% vs. 2.1%; HR 1.02, 95% CI 0.8 to 1.28) No significant difference in hospitalization due to HF (3.6% vs. 3.4%; HR 1.04, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.25) No significant difference in non-cancer-related death (5.3% vs. 5.2%; HR 1.01, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.17). In the Diuretic Comparison Project study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in hospitalization for any cause. significant difference in hypokalemia (6.0% vs. 4.4%). In the Diuretic Comparison Project study, the conclusion was: in adult patients ≥ 65 years of age receiving hydrochlorothiazide at a dose of 25-50 mg/day, chlorthalidone was not superior to hydrochlorothiazide with respect to the composite outcome of nonfatal myocardial infarction, stroke, HF resulting in hospitalization, urgent coronary revascularization for unstable angina, and non-cancer-related death.

### Are there benefits to specific antihypertensive drug therapy? [^457ccf62]. American Journal of Hypertension (2003). Low credibility.

The antihypertensive drug classes that have reduced cardiovascular events safely either in large placebo-controlled trials or in comparison with other effective antihypertensive drugs in large morbidity trials are diuretics, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), and calcium channel blockers (CCBs). Although control of blood pressure (BP) is a primary goal of therapy, evidence from several clinical trials suggests that certain antihypertensive agents provide clinical benefits independent of their effect on BP. In the recently reported Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT), an ACE inhibitor, a CCB, and an alpha-blocker reduced coronary events and mortality to a similar extent as a thiazide-type diuretic, but the diuretic reduced one or more major cardiovascular events, especially heart failure, more than the other agents. In the Losartan Intervention For Endpoint reduction in hypertension (LIFE) trial, the ARB losartan reduced cardiovascular morbidity (primarily stroke) more than the beta-blocker atenolol. Although an ARB has not yet been compared with a diuretic in a morbidity trial, as most patients require more than one drug to control BP, and a diuretic plus an ARB is a very effective and well-tolerated combination, this uncertainty applies to a minority of patients. A primary goal in treating hypertension should be to reach a patient's goal BP, but initial selection of drugs based on hypertension morbidity study results and other compelling indications should be given priority.

### Hydrochlorothiazide is America's most popular thiazide, but should It Be? [^ec07f6e6]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Table. 
Major Randomized Controlled Trials of the Thiazide Diuretics Since 2000

The DCP (Diuretic Comparison Project), published in December 2022, was the first RCT to study hydrochlorothiazide and chlorthalidone head to head. After a median follow‐up of 2.4 years among more than 13 500 Veterans Affairs patients, there were no differences in the primary outcome (a composite of death and major adverse cardiovascular events) or in any of its components.To conclude, however, that DCP finally showed chlorthalidone and hydrochlorothiazide are equivalent is an overstatement. Among DCP's strengths are its pragmatic design and methods, but there was a lower‐than‐expected primary outcome event rate and the doses of hydrochlorothiazide and chlorthalidone used were lower than those studied in prior RCTs. Nevertheless, to date, no RCT directly comparing the thiazide diuretics has shown that either chlorthalidone or indapamide is superior to hydrochlorothiazide in reducing cardiovascular events or mortality.

### Chlorthalidone compared with hydrochlorothiazide in reducing cardiovascular events: systematic review and network meta-analyses [^d7d79a26]. Hypertension (2012). Low credibility.

Hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) is widely used for hypertension, and prescriptions for HCTZ outnumber those for chlorthalidone (CTDN) by >20-fold in 2 recent surveys. Some have recently expressed a preference for CTDN. However, head-to-head trials testing the effect of the 2 drugs on cardiovascular events (CVEs) are lacking. We conducted a systematic review of randomized trials in which 1 arm was based on either HCTZ or CTDN followed by 2 types of network meta-analyses, a drug-adjusted analysis and an office systolic blood pressure-adjusted analysis. Nine trials were identified: 3 based on HCTZ and 6 based on CTDN. In the drug-adjusted analysis (n = 50946), the percentage of risk reduction in congestive heart failure for CTDN versus HCTZ was 23 (95% CI, 2-39; P = 0.032); and in all CVEs was 21 (95% CI, 12-28; P<0.0001). In the office systolic blood pressure-adjusted analysis (n = 78350), the percentage of risk reduction in CVEs for CTDN versus HCTZ was 18 (95% CI, 3-30; P = 0.024). When the reduction in office systolic blood pressure was identical in the 2 arms, the risk for CVEs in HCTZ arms was 19% higher than in its nondiuretic comparator arms (P = 0.021). Relative to HCTZ, the number needed to treat with CTDN to prevent 1 CVE over 5 years was 27. In conclusion, CTDN is superior to HCTZ in preventing cardiovascular events. This cannot be attributed entirely to the lesser effect of HCTZ on office systolic blood pressure but may be attributed to the pleomorphic effects of alternative medications or to the short duration of action of HCTZ.

### Pathophysiology of antihypertensive therapy with diuretics [^cb029264]. Hypertension Research (2006). Low credibility.

Recent progress in antihypertensive therapy has widened the selection of drugs, and large clinical trials have attracted attention to newer classes of antihypertensives. Consequently, the use of diuretics as antihypertensive agents has been relatively reduced, particularly since the newer drugs are associated with fewer adverse metabolic reactions. However, diuretics have a specific activity of removing sodium from the body fluid, thereby rendering the blood pressure insensitive to sodium intake, relieving the overload to systemic circulation, and normalizing the circadian rhythm of blood pressure from a non-dipper to a dipper pattern. At low doses, diuretics are known to be as effective as all other antihypertensive agents for reducing nearly all types of cardiovascular events. In this brief review, the indication for thiazide diuretics will be discussed based on the pathophysiology of hypertension and antihypertensive therapy with diuretics mainly from the point of view of sodium metabolism. Low-dose diuretics will continue to be an important agent in the treatment of hypertension, mostly in combination with vasodilators such as modulators of the reninangiotensin system and calcium channel blockers.

Other disadvantages of diuretics

Diuretics may induce some metabolic alterations that are harmful. The most common metabolic derangement is hyponatremia, which appears to be particularly common in elderly women. This side effect can be prevented by use of a low to medium dose of diuretics and by instructing patients to limit fluid intake. The deleterious effects of thiazide on lipid profile are mainly observed in the short term and almost disappear in long-term studies.

Role of diuretics as an add-on therapy

Recently, two large prospective studies cast doubt on the role of thiazides as an add-on therapy. The Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial (ASCOT) compared the β-blocker atenolol with the calcium antagonist amlodipine. A thiazide was added to atenolol and an ACE inhibitor was added to amlodipine when BP did not reach the goal. The primary end points were not significantly different between the two regimens, but fewer individuals on the amlodipine-based regimen had fatal and nonfatal stroke, total CV events and procedures, and all-cause mortality. From this study, we can only learn that atenolol is less effective than amlodipine, but we cannot blame the diuretic in the worse outcome. The ACCOMPLISH trial was stopped early when the data were clear that the single pill combination of ACE inhibitor with calcium antagonist was superior to the combination of ACE inhibitor with a diuretic. The amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide components of the single pill combination could be titrated to 25 and 10 mg, respectively. Although the dose of amlodipine in the trial was similar to that demonstrating favorable outcomes in other outcome trials, the dose range for hydrochlorothiazide (12.5–25 mg) was lower than the dose range (equivalent to 25–50 mg) used in trials demonstrating benefits of thiazide on CV outcome. Information on supplemented antihypertensive agents was not reported, but the recommended supplementary drugs were α- and β-blockers, for which effects on CV outcomes are inferior. Of note, a small but significant BP difference (0.9 mmHg systolic and 1.1 mmHg diastolic; P < 0.001 for both) was recorded between the two arms of treatment favoring the ACE inhibitor–calcium antagonist combination. The right conclusion of the ACCOMPLISH study is that hydrochlorothiazide in a dose of ≤25 mg/day may be less effective in preventing CV disease than a full dose of amlodipine.

### Olmesartan medoxomil, amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide tablet 20 / 5 / 12.5 mg (olmesartan medoxomil, amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide 20 / 5 / 12.5 mg) [^d1e21bb9]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Olmesartan medoxomil, amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide tablets are indicated for the treatment of hypertension, alone or with other antihypertensive agents, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular (CV) events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes including the class to which this drug principally belongs. There are no controlled trials demonstrating risk reduction with olmesartan medoxomil, amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide tablets.

Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than one drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program's Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC).

Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly.

Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal.

Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy.

Limitations of Use

This fixed combination drug is not indicated for the initial therapy of hypertension.

### Thiazide diuretics alone or combined with potassium-sparing diuretics to treat hypertension: a systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^a967a8be]. Journal of Hypertension (2023). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

This network meta-analysis, with many RCTs and participants, showed that the BP-lowering effect of thiazides increased with higher doses and was enhanced by the association with potassium-sparing diuretics. The potassium-sparing diuretics further mitigated the potassium depletion induced by thiazide diuretics. Potassium-sparing diuretics did not affect uric acid increases. The estimates of the effects on glucose were based on few studies; however, the values tended to be lower in the associations with potassium-sparing diuretics. The association of potassium-sparing agents did not influence the effects of thiazide diuretics on blood lipids.

The importance of high BP in the causation of cardiovascular disease demands effective strategies to mitigate the incidence of noncommunicable diseases. The ideal treatment of patients with hypertension should include drugs with known effectiveness to prevent cardiovascular events, convenient administration and low incidence of adverse effects. Diuretics have the best record in terms of the prevention of cardiovascular events. In the SPRINT trial, the significant difference in the proportion of BP-lowering classes of drugs in the intensive treatment arm (SBP target below 120 mmHg) and the control group (SBP target below 140 mmHg) was the use of diuretics (approximately 60 vs. 40%, respectively). The BP-lowering effect of diuretics is at least similar to other agents, and their long duration of action is instrumental in circumventing lower adherence to treatment.

Metabolic adverse events (particularly lowering of serum potassium and increasing uric acid and glucose) are reasons of concern regarding the use of thiazide diuretics. In a case--control study, low blood potassium was associated with lower effectiveness in preventing major cardiovascular events in the SHEP trial and was a risk factor for sudden cardiac death in a case--control study. Moreover, the reduction of potassium was associated with increased blood glucose levels. These findings suggest that treatments that increase potassium (e.g. supplementation of potassium chloride and replacement of sodium chloride by potassium chloride) lower BP. Replacing 25% of the dietary sodium salt with potassium chloride reduced the incidence of stroke and cardiovascular events.

The findings of this network meta-analysis suggest that the association of potassium-sparing diuretics increases the BP-lowering effect of thiazides and mitigates some of their adverse effects. The effects of the association of thiazides with potassium-sparing diuretics on potassium and a trend for effects over glucose in this meta-analysis agree with those observed in the PATHWAY-3 trial.

### USPSTF recommends against initiating aspirin for... [^fa1d669c]. AAFP (2022). Medium credibility.

Clinical Question Should primary care clinicians recommend low-dose aspirin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in adults 60 years or older. Bottom Line In this updated review, the U. S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends against initiating low-dose aspirin for the primary prevention of CVD in adults 60 years or older. The USPSTF recommends shared decision-making regarding the initiation of low-dose aspirin for the primary prevention of CVD in adults 40 to 59 years of age with a 10% or greater risk of CVD and without an increased risk of bleeding. Synopsis The USPSTF found adequate evidence that low-dose aspirin used for the primary prevention of CVD reduces the risk of major cardiovascular events. There is no high-quality evidence, however, that low-dose aspirin reduces the risk of cardiovascular mortality or all-cause mortality.

Evidence remains uncertain for a benefit of reducing the risk of colorectal cancer. Potential harms include a significant risk of major bleeding events, with increasing risk proportional to increasing age. New recommendations include considering aspirin for high-risk individuals at 40 years of age instead of 50 and no longer recommending aspirin for primary prevention in adults 60 years or older. For patients already taking aspirin or choosing to start taking aspirin, the USPSTF recommends stopping aspirin at approximately 75 years of age. The American Heart Association recommends shared decision-making regarding the use of aspirin for the primary prevention of CVD in high-risk adults 40 to 70 years of age who do not have an increased risk of bleeding. A previous Top 20 POEM found that there was no net cardiovascular benefit and no effect on cancer incidence or mortality in four of the most recent large trials performed in an era of better cardiovascular risk factor management and screening for colorectal cancer.

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Initial medication selection for primary hypertension—first-line drug classes and comparative evidence are as follows: For adults initiating therapy, thiazide-type diuretics, long-acting dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker (CCB), and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) are recommended as first-line therapy to prevent cardiovascular disease (CVD). Strong randomized controlled trial (RCT) evidence supports 4 classes of first-line agents compared with placebo, and a meta-analysis of 50 RCTs with 58 head-to-head comparisons involving 247 006 individuals revealed subtle differences between first-line agents. βBs were less effective than first-line classes in preventing strokes and had a less favorable side effect profile; therefore, they should be reserved for adults with compelling indications. The primary goal of treatment should be to reduce blood pressure (BP) to the target level, considering the underlying CVD risk and compelling indications. In a large pragmatic RCT comparing hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) 25 mg to chlorthalidone 12.5 mg, switching from HCTZ to chlorthalidone did not lower the rates of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE).

### Benazepril plus amlodipine or hydrochlorothiazide for hypertension in high-risk patients [^82d532b1]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2008). Excellent credibility.

Background

The optimal combination drug therapy for hypertension is not established, although current U.S. guidelines recommend inclusion of a diuretic. We hypothesized that treatment with the combination of an angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and a dihydropyridine calcium-channel blocker would be more effective in reducing the rate of cardiovascular events than treatment with an ACE inhibitor plus a thiazide diuretic.

Methods

In a randomized, double-blind trial, we assigned 11,506 patients with hypertension who were at high risk for cardiovascular events to receive treatment with either benazepril plus amlodipine or benazepril plus hydrochlorothiazide. The primary end point was the composite of death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, hospitalization for angina, resuscitation after sudden cardiac arrest, and coronary revascularization.

Results

The baseline characteristics of the two groups were similar. The trial was terminated early after a mean follow-up of 36 months, when the boundary of the prespecified stopping rule was exceeded. Mean blood pressures after dose adjustment were 131.6/73.3 mm Hg in the benazepril-amlodipine group and 132.5/74.4 mm Hg in the benazepril-hydrochlorothiazide group. There were 552 primary-outcome events in the benazepril-amlodipine group (9.6%) and 679 in the benazepril-hydrochlorothiazide group (11.8%), representing an absolute risk reduction with benazepril-amlodipine therapy of 2.2% and a relative risk reduction of 19.6% (hazard ratio, 0.80, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.72 to 0.90; P<0.001). For the secondary end point of death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and nonfatal stroke, the hazard ratio was 0.79 (95% CI, 0.67 to 0.92; P=0.002). Rates of adverse events were consistent with those observed from clinical experience with the study drugs.

Conclusions

The benazepril-amlodipine combination was superior to the benazepril-hydrochlorothiazide combination in reducing cardiovascular events in patients with hypertension who were at high risk for such events. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00170950.)

### Hydrochlorothiazide is America's most popular thiazide, but should It Be? [^86edc597]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

These key pharmacologic differences have contributed to the long‐standing debate among clinicians and hypertension experts about whether chlorthalidone or hydrochlorothiazide is superior. Multiple systematic reviews and meta‐analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have previously demonstrated that the thiazide‐like diuretics better prevent cardiovascular events and all‐cause mortality compared with the thiazide‐type diuretics.These systematic reviews and meta‐analyses, however, included many RCTs conducted before 1990 and few RCTs of indapamide. Consequently, the generalizability of the findings to the current era may be limited as the prevalence and nature of cardiovascular disease risk factors have evolved and as we have refined our knowledge about which classes should be used first line for hypertension treatment. Observational studies have provided contrasting conclusions on this debate, with one finding no difference between chlorthalidone and hydrochlorothiazidewhereas another one showed better outcomes with hydrochlorothiazide, not chlorthalidone.However, the follow‐up period in these observational studies was probably too brief to detect differences in clinical end points and the conflicting findings are likely due to residual confounding. For these reasons, the available meta‐analyses and observational studies offer little practical guidance in thiazide selection. Instead, what may be more helpful for current clinicians is to recall the findings from more recent, large RCTs that have critically appraised these agents. The Table,,,,,,lists several pivotal RCTs of the thiazides published since 2000 relevant to common and everyday clinical scenarios. Chlorthalidone and indapamide treat hypertension effectively and safely in several clinical settings, including in patients with multiple coronary artery disease risk factors,prior stroke,elderly age,and advanced chronic kidney disease.Additionally, small RCTs have demonstrated that combination therapy containing chlorthalidone provides superior hypertension treatment compared with combination therapy containing hydrochlorothiazide and to combination therapy without any thiazide diuretic, including among patients with stage 2 hypertension.Finally, the thiazide‐like diuretics offer pleiotropic protection against cardiovascular diseases independently of blood pressure reduction.In contrast, no cardiovascular benefit with hydrochlorothiazide treatment has been consistently found.Despite these randomized data, the hydrochlorothiazide‐versus‐chlorthalidone debate has continued in part because until recently no trial had directly compared the 2.

### Olmesartan medoxomil-hydrochlorothiazide [^7219aaf7]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal.

Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy.

Olmesartan medoxomil and hydrochlorothiazide may be used alone, or in combination with other antihypertensive drugs.

Olmesartan medoxomil and hydrochlorothiazide is a combination of olmesartan, an angiotensin II receptor blocker and hydrochlorothiazide, a thiazide diuretic indicated for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. (1)

### Thiazide diuretics alone or combined with potassium-sparing diuretics to treat hypertension: a systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^203d4fb3]. Journal of Hypertension (2023). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Thiazide diuretics and thiazide-like diuretics (e.g. chlorthalidone and indapamide) were the primary drugs tested in landmark randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that demonstrated the high degree of efficacy of blood pressure (BP)-lowering in preventing major cardiovascular events in patients with hypertension. However, there are no RCTs comparing the efficacy of different thiazides, alone or combined with potassium-sparing diuretics, to prevent cardiovascular outcomes in patients with hypertension. Indirect comparisons by meta-analyses and evidence from observational studies returned conflicting results.

Comparisons of the BP-lowering effect of the several thiazides, alone and associated with potassium-sparing agents, have been rarely investigated in head-to-head clinical trials. The effect of amiloride and triamterene on BP remained uncertain and was not identified in a systematic review of six double-blind RCTs with a total of 496 participants. In two isolated trials, however, amiloride increased the BP-lowering effect of hydrochlorothiazide. Amiloride may be effective in resistant hypertension, particularly at higher doses. Potassium supplementation has a BP-lowering effect, and the replacement of a proportion of sodium chloride with potassium chloride in meals reduced BP. A pioneering nutritional RCT showed that replacing 25% of the sodium chloride content with potassium chloride was associated with reducing the incidence of major cardiovascular events and death. The antihypertensive efficacy of spironolactone and eplerenone have been well documented ; however, these drugs are not commonly used with thiazides in fixed combinations.

Thiazides have been associated with adverse metabolic effects, including hypokalaemia, hyperglycaemia, hyponatremia, hyperuricemia, hyperlipidaemia and hypomagnesemia in a dose-dependent fashion. The risk of hypokalaemia, impaired glucose tolerance or sudden death may be minimized by combining thiazides with potassium-sparing diuretics (e.g. spironolactone, eplerenone, amiloride or triamterene).

The critical role of potassium in BP control and the adverse effects of thiazide diuretics suggest that potassium-sparing diuretics can be effective adjuncts in treating hypertension. The scarcity of direct comparisons between thiazides alone with thiazides associated with potassium-sparing diuretics concerning their BP-lowering and adverse effects motivated this systematic review with a Bayesian network meta-analysis.

### Value of low dose combination treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs: analysis of 354 randomised trials [^226eb177]. BMJ (2003). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To determine the average reduction in blood pressure, prevalence of adverse effects, and reduction in risk of stroke and ischaemic heart disease events produced by the five main categories of blood pressure lowering drugs according to dose, singly and in combination.

Design

Meta-analysis of 354 randomised double blind placebo controlled trials of thiazides, beta blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists, and calcium channel blockers in fixed dose.

Subjects

40,000 treated patients and 16,000 patients given placebo.

Main Outcome Measures

Placebo adjusted reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressure and prevalence of adverse effects, according to dose expressed as a multiple of the standard (recommended) doses of the drugs.

Results

All five categories of drug produced similar reductions in blood pressure. The average reduction was 9.1 mm Hg systolic and 5.5 mm Hg diastolic at standard dose and 7.1 mm Hg systolic and 4.4 mm Hg diastolic (20% lower) at half standard dose. The drugs reduced blood pressure from all pretreatment levels, more so from higher levels; for a 10 mm Hg higher blood pressure the reduction was 1.0 mm Hg systolic and 1.1 mm Hg diastolic greater. The blood pressure lowering effects of different categories of drugs were additive. Symptoms attributable to thiazides, beta blockers, and calcium channel blockers were strongly dose related; symptoms caused by ACE inhibitors (mainly cough) were not dose related. Angiotensin II receptor antagonists caused no excess of symptoms. The prevalence of symptoms with two drugs in combination was less than additive. Adverse metabolic effects (such as changes in cholesterol or potassium) were negligible at half standard dose.

Conclusions

Combination low dose drug treatment increases efficacy and reduces adverse effects. From the average blood pressure in people who have strokes (150/90 mm Hg) three drugs at half standard dose are estimated to lower blood pressure by 20 mm Hg systolic and 11 mm Hg diastolic and thereby reduce the risk of stroke by 63% and ischaemic heart disease events by 46% at age 60-69.

### Diuretic treatment of hypertension [^7004699d]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

In a large meta-analysis, including 48,220 patients, Psaty et al. found that high-dose diuretic therapy reduced the risk of stroke by 51%, whereas therapy with β-blockers reduced the risk by only 29% (P = 0.02). Klungel et al. showed that among 1,237 single-drug users with no history of CV disease, the adjusted risk of ischemic stroke was 2 to 2 1/2 times higher among users of β-blockers, calcium antagonists, or ACE inhibitors than among users of a diuretic alone. Interestingly, even in patients with CV disease, diuretics still conferred a lower stroke risk than other drugs, although the difference was considerably smaller. The recent Avoiding Cardiovascular Events Through Combination Therapy in Patients Living With Systolic Hypertension (ACCOMPLISH) trial showed that a combination of the ACE inhibitor benazepril with hydrochlorothiazide was less effective in lowering the risk of the predefined primary end points than the combination of benazepril with amlodipine. However, analysis of the benefit for the individual components of the primary end points showed that, for stroke prevention, hydrochlorothiazide and amlodipine were the same. Thus, for stroke prevention, a diuretic is superior to some antihypertensive agents.

### Metoprolol tartrate and hydrochlorothiazide (Lopressor HCT) [^a77fe6d6]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal.

Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy.

LOPRESSOR HCT may be administered with other antihypertensive agents.

Limitation of Use

LOPRESSOR HCT is not indicated for initial therapy of hypertension. If the fixed combination represents the dose titrated to the individual patient’s needs, therapy with the fixed combination may be more convenient than with the separate components.

LOPRESSOR HCTis the combination tablet of metoprolol tartrate, a beta adrenoceptor blocker and hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ), a thiazide diuretic, indicated for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. (1)

Search strategy and information sources

Searches were performed in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus and LILACS. ClinicalTrials.gov was searched for possible results in unpublished studies, and the Educational Resources Information Center (ERIC [ProQuest]) was searched for results in nonindexed journals or other reporting forms, all from inception to 15 September 2021, with no language restrictions. To improve search strategy sensitivity, the strategies were developed using Medline subject heading (MeSH) terms, synonyms and Boolean operators (where possible). Keywords and MeSH terms were as follows: ‘hydrochlorothiazide’, ‘chlorothiazide’, ‘bendroflumethiazide’, ‘hydroflumethiazide’, ‘cyclopenthiazide’, ‘chlorthalidone’, ‘metolazone’, ‘indapamide’, ‘mefruside’, ‘xipamide’, ‘bemetizide’, ‘spironolactone’, ‘eplerenone,’ ‘amiloride’, ‘triamterene’, ‘thiazide diuretics’, ‘inhibitor of the epithelial sodium channel’, ‘potassium sparing diuretic’ and ‘hypertension’. Comprehensive search strategies are provided in the Supplement (Search Strategy).

Study selection

An electronic database was exported to reference manager software (EndNote X9), and duplicates were removed. Titles and abstracts were independently selected by pairs of independent reviewers using the liberal accelerated approach. Disagreements were resolved by consensus or by a third reviewer. Authors were contacted to seek any potential unpublished outcomes.

Data extraction and items

The following data were extracted: study characteristics, baseline characteristics of participants, interventions and comparators, and outcomes.

The interventions of interest were classified as thiazide diuretic alone or thiazide diuretic combined with a potassium-sparing diuretic and further stratified according to the mean daily dose. The doses of the interventions were categorized as proportions of the manufacturer's recommended starting dose: low-dose (< 2 × start dose) and high-dose (≥ 2 × start dose). The starting dose of hydrochlorothiazide was 25 mg because chlorthalidone is 1.5–2 times as effective as hydrochlorothiazide for lowering BP.

Data on drugs and doses are presented in Table S1 in the Supplement. The full glossary of extracted variables with their definitions is available at.

### Redefining diuretics use in hypertension: why select a thiazide-like diuretic? [^bb37b794]. Journal of Hypertension (2019). Medium credibility.

Clinical endpoints

The most recent ESC/ESH guidelines cite the lack of head-to-head studies with clinical event data and the low availability of single-pill combinations that include thiazide-like diuretics as the main reasons for not differentiating between thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics. Yet, other guidelines have based their recommendation to differentiate between the two groups of diuretics on the results of meta-analyses that evaluate cardiovascular event risk after treatment with HCTZ, chlorthalidone and indapamide (Table 4) [,–]. Interestingly, in one of these meta-analyses (21 studies), in which two analyses were performed (with and without adjustment for changes in blood pressure), the reduction in risk of cardiovascular events and heart failure was significant for thiazide-like diuretics (chlorthalidone and indapamide) irrespective of the adjustment for blood pressure. For thiazides (chlorothiazide, HCTZ, trichlormethiazide, bendroflumethiazide, bendrofluazide), however, the reduction in risk was only significant when no adjustment for blood pressure reduction was made. These data suggest that blood pressure independent reduction of risk occurred with thiazide-like, but not thiazide diuretics.

### Effectiveness of initiating treatment with valsartan / hydrochlorothiazide in patients with stage-1 or stage-2 hypertension [^46d3ce53]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2010). Low credibility.

Discussion

Although evidence from clinical trials suggests that BP reduction to goal is crucial in reducing CV outcomes, at least half of all hypertensives remain untreated, with most of those that are treated requiring combination therapy to achieve the target BP control rate. Results from this study suggest that for patients with stage-1 and stage-2 hypertension, initiating treatment with combination therapy using the ARB, valsartan and low-dose HCTZ (160/12.5 mg and increasing the dose to 160/25 mg if needed) provided greater benefit in reaching BP control rates compared with initiating treatment with low- or high-dose valsartan monotherapy. The study demonstrated that by initiating therapy with two antihypertensive medications and titrating the dose every 2 weeks, if required, will lead to more effective BP control rates in a shorter period of time as compared with initiating treatment by monotherapy. After only 4 weeks of therapy, 58% of patients on the initial combination agent achieved BP control as compared with only 26% initiated with valsartan (80 mg). Furthermore, AEs between V/HCTZ and the two valsartan monotherapy arms were similar, confirming the excellent tolerability achieved with combination of an ARB and low-dose diuretic. Risks associated with excessive drops in BP in V/HCTZ were also not observed, as noted by similar incidences of AEs related to low BP and hypotensive episodes among the three groups during the study. The preliminary concern of ‘over-treatment' in the V/HCTZ group was also not observed, since over 85% of patients initiated on valsartan monotherapy required add-on HCTZ therapy.

### Critical analysis of the effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on renal tubular sodium, water and chloride homeostasis and their role in influencing heart failure outcomes [^b547a58f]. Circulation (2023). Medium credibility.

It is noteworthy that treatments that produce short-term increases in sodium or water excretion do not generally reduce the subsequent risk of cardiovascular death or heart failure hospitalization. Although intensive short-term diuresis to achieve hemoconcentration in hospitalized patients is associated with lower cardiac filling pressures,early decongestion has not been associated with improved outcomes in observational studies or clinical trials. –,, More intensive treatment with intravenous loop diuretics yields a greater short-term diuresis, but does not reduce heart failure events at 60 days.The addition of hydrochlorothiazide to a loop diuretic yields a modest diuretic effect, but no effect on death or rehospitalization at 90 days.Acetazolamide potentiates the natriuretic response to loop diuretics, but has no effect on morbidity and mortality at 3 months.In a trial comparing short-term therapy with low or high doses of spironolactone, there was no between-group difference in major heart failure events after 30 to 60 days.Last, in a large-scale trial in patients hospitalized for heart failure, vasopressin antagonism induced a short-term diuretic effect, but continued treatment for a median of 10 months did not reduce the risk of cardiovascular death or hospitalization for heart failure.

These observations, taken collectively, suggest that a short-term diuretic effect of SGLT2 inhibitors does not contribute meaningfully to the early or long-term ability of these drugs to reduce the risk of major heart failure events.

### Low-dose combinations with 3 or 4 blood pressure-lowering medications for the treatment of hypertension [^283397af]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Study Limitations

First, we pooled together trials with different combinations of antihypertensives, which may have partly contributed to the heterogeneity between trials. However, the total standard dose of each LDC did not explain underlying heterogeneity in BP reduction. Some analyses may be underpowered to detect a difference in adverse events and there were differences in follow-up duration between studies. Further studies of LDCs in different patient populations would be important to determine if differences in tolerability exist. This study was not powered to investigate for clinical event reduction, although the relationship between BP reduction and reduction in major cardiovascular events and death is well established.Finally, this analysis was pooled using study-level data, and more precise estimates of the relationship between pretreatment BP and expected treatment efficacy may be obtained with individual patient meta-analyses.

In conclusion, LDCs in the form of 3 or 4 antihypertensives at less than standard dose are an effective and well-tolerated option for the initial management of hypertension. LDCs offer a “single step” solution that reliably achieves BP target in two-thirds of patients at first follow-up visit and remain superior to usual care that involve clinician-guided uptitration of therapy. Finally, BP reduction with LDCs was associated with trial level pretreatment BP, with greater BP reductions observed in higher grades of hypertension compared to lower or mildly elevated BP.

Perspectives 

COMPETENCY IN PATIENT CARE AND CLINICAL SKILLS: In patients with hypertension, low-dose combinations consisting of 3 or 4 antihypertensives each at low dose are well tolerated and associated with significantly greater reductions in BP compared to an initial monotherapy and usual care. The BP reduction of low-dose combinations are highly dependent on their pretreatment BP, with smaller reductions in BP observed in individuals with only mildly elevated BP.

TRANSLATIONAL OUTLOOK: Future studies should evaluate the efficacy and safety of other combinations of antihypertensives and the use of low-dose combinations as an initial treatment option in different patient populations.

### Standards of medical care in diabetes – 2010 [^08f06e97]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

Lowering of blood pressure with regimens based on a variety of antihypertensive drugs, including ACE inhibitors, ARBs, β-blockers, diuretics, and calcium channel blockers, has been shown to be effective in reducing cardiovascular events. Several studies suggested that ACE inhibitors may be superior to dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers in reducing cardiovascular events (–). However, a variety of other studies have shown no specific advantage to ACE inhibitors as initial treatment of hypertension in the general hypertensive population, but rather an advantage on cardiovascular outcomes of initial therapy with low-dose thiazide diuretics.

In people with diabetes, inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) may have unique advantages for initial or early therapy of hypertension. In a nonhypertension trial of high-risk individuals including a large subset with diabetes, an ACE inhibitor reduced CVD outcomes. In patients with congestive heart failure (CHF), including diabetic subgroups, ARBs have been shown to reduce major CVD outcomes (–), and in type 2 patients with significant nephropathy, ARBs were superior to calcium channel blockers for reducing heart failure (–). Though evidence for distinct advantages of RAS inhibitors on CVD outcomes in diabetes remains conflicting, the high CVD risks associated with diabetes, and the high prevalence of undiagnosed CVD, may still favor recommendations for their use as first-line hypertension therapy in people with diabetes. Recently, the blood pressure arm of the ADVANCE trial demonstrated that routine administration of a fixed combination of the ACE inhibitor perindopril and the diuretic indapamide significantly reduced combined microvascular and macrovascular outcomes, as well as CVD and total mortality. The improved outcomes also could have been due to lower achieved blood pressure in the perindopril-indapamide arm. In addition, the ACCOMPLISH (Avoiding Cardiovascular Events in Combination Therapy in Patients Living with Systolic Hypertension) trial showed a decrease in morbidity and mortality in those receiving benazapril and amlodipine versus benazapril and hydrochlorothiazide. The compelling benefits of RAS inhibitors in diabetic patients with albuminuria or renal insufficiency provide additional rationale for use of these agents (see below, VI.B. Nephropathy screening and treatment).

### Effectiveness of initiating treatment with valsartan / hydrochlorothiazide in patients with stage-1 or stage-2 hypertension [^f1c51d4c]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2010). Low credibility.

This prospective, 6-week, multicenter, double-blind study examined the benefits of initiating treatment with combination valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) compared with initial valsartan monotherapy for 648 patients with stage-1 or stage-2 hypertension (age=52.6+/-10 years; 54% male; baseline blood pressure (BP)=161/98 mm Hg, 32% stage 1). Patients were randomized to valsartan 80 mg (V-low), valsartan 160 mg (V-high) or valsartan/HCTZ 160/12.5 mg (V/HCTZ), and electively titrated after weeks 2 and 4 to the next dosage level (maximum dose valsartan/HCTZ 160/25 mg) if BP remained >140/90 mm Hg. At end of the study, patients initiated with V/HCTZ required less titration steps compared with the initial valsartan monotherapy groups (63 vs 86% required titration by study end, respectively) and reached the target BP goal of <140/90 mm Hg in a shorter period of time (2.8 weeks) (P<0.0001) vs V-low (4.3 weeks) and V-high (3.9 weeks). Initial combination therapy was also associated with higher BP control rates and greater reductions in both systolic and diastolic BP from baseline (63%, -27.7+/-13/-15.1+/-8 mm Hg) compared with V-low (46%, -21.2+/-13/-11.4+/-8 mm Hg, P<0.0001) or V-high (51%, -24.0+/-13/-12.0+/-10 mm Hg, P<0.01). Overall and drug-related AEs were mild to moderate and were similar between V/HCTZ (53.1 and 14.1%, respectively) and the two monotherapy groups, V-low (50.5 and 13.8%) and V-high (50.7 and 11.8%). In conclusion, initiating therapy with a combination of valsartan and low-dose HCTZ results in early, improved BP efficacy with similar tolerability as compared with starting treatment with a low or higher dose of valsartan for patients with stage-1 and stage-2 hypertension.

### Diuretics for hypertension: a review and update [^91b4f045]. American Journal of Hypertension (2016). Low credibility.

This review and update focuses on the clinical features of hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ), the thiazide-like agents chlorthalidone (CTDN) and indapamide (INDAP), potassium-sparing ENaC inhibitors and aldosterone receptor antagonists, and loop diuretics. Diuretics are the second most commonly prescribed class of antihypertensive medication, and thiazide-related diuretics have increased at a rate greater than that of antihypertensive medications as a whole. The latest hypertension guidelines have underscored the importance of diuretics for all patients, but particularly for those with salt-sensitive and resistant hypertension. HCTZ is 4.2-6.2 systolic mm Hg less potent than CTDN, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, beta blockers, and calcium channel blockers by 24-hour measurements and 5.1mm Hg systolic less potent than INDAP by office measurements. For reducing cardiovascular events (CVEs), HCTZ is less effective than enalapril and amlodipine in randomized trials, and, in network analysis of trials, it is less effective than CTDN and HCTZ-amiloride. Combined with thiazide-type diuretics, potassium-sparing agents decrease ventricular ectopy and reduce the risk for sudden cardiac death relative to thiazide-type diuretics used alone. A recent synthesis of 44 trials has shown that the relative potencies in milligrams among spironolactone (SPIR), amiloride, and eplerenone (EPLER) are approximately from 25 to 10 to 100, respectively, which may be important when SPIR is poorly tolerated. SPIR reduces proteinuria beyond that provided by other renin angiotensin aldosterone inhibitors. EPLER also reduces proteinuria and has beneficial effects on endothelial function. While guidelines often do not differentiate among specific diuretics, this review demonstrates that these distinctions are important for managing hypertension.

### STEP to blood pressure management of elderly hypertension: evidence from Asia [^1d586260]. Hypertension Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Asia evidence on cadiovascular benefits of BP control

A number of clinical trials conducted in Asian patients have showed that lowering SBP is associated with reduced cardiovascular risk. The Systolic Hypertension in China (Syst-China) trial investigated the effects of antihypertensive treatment on cardiovascular risk in 2394 Chinese hypertensive patients aged 69–79 years with an averaged BP of 170.5/86 mmHg at baseline. After a median follow-up of 3 years, step-wise active treatment with a calcium channel blocker (CCB) with or without an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) and/or a thiazide diuretic significantly reduced the rate of stroke by 38% and cardiovascular events by 37%, with an averaged BP level reaching 150.5/81 mmHg. Another randomized controlled trial from the Felodipine Event Reduction (FEVER) in China, including 9711 Chinese hypertensive patients aged 50–79 years, showed that cardiovascular outcomes were significantly reduced by more intense therapy (low-dose hydrochlorothiazide and low-dose felodipine) achieving a mean SBP of 138 mmHg compared with less-intense therapy (low-dose hydrochlorothiazide and placebo) achieving a mean of 142 mmHg during a follow-up of 3.3 years. Moreover, a subgroup analysis in patients aged ≥65 years demonstrated that a SBP goal <140 mmHg significantly reduced the risk of 44% stroke, 47% cardiovascular events, and 36% all-cause death.

Other studies have investigated whether the target for SBP control influences the impact of treatment on cardiovascular events. In the Valsartan in Elderly Isolated Systolic Hypertension (VALISH) trial conducted in 3260 Japanese patients aged 70–84 years with isolated systolic hypertension, SBP was reduced by 5.6 mmHg in the strict (<140 mmHg) vs. moderate (140–150 mmHg) SBP control groups (P < 0.001) during a median follow-up of 3 years, but this was not accompanied by a significant decrease in the cardiovascular events and renal failure. Similar findings were reported in the Japanese Trial to Assess Optimal Systolic Blood Pressure in Elderly Hypertensive Patients (JATOS) study in which 4418 patients aged 65–85 years received CCB-based therapy. Despite an achieved SBP difference around 10 mmHg between strict SBP control (target <140 mmHg) and mild control groups (target 140–160 mmHg), there was no difference in the incidence of cardiovascular disease and renal failure.

### Diuretic treatment of hypertension [^3f3f5a44]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

The results of this study raised the question whether all thiazide-type diuretics are equal. Several successful diuretic studies used chlorthalidone in a dose of up to 25 mg/day. A meta-analysis of trials done until 2004 reported similar clinical CV outcomes across the class. However, these studies used doses of these agents that were higher than the 12.5–25 mg/day dose of hydrochlorothiazide used in the ACCOMPLISH study. Recent data suggest that chlorthalidone is 1.5- to 2-fold more potent in lowering BP than hydrochlorothiazide. Thus, to achieve the beneficial effect with diuretics, one should use hydrochlorothiazide in a dose of up to at least 37.5 mg/day. Another thiazide-like diuretic that is less discussed is indapamide. This agent has less adverse effect on metabolic parameters than other diuretics, is more effective than enalapril in reducing left ventricular mass, is equivalent to enalapril in reducing microalbuminuria, and is effective in reducing CV morbidity and mortality in clinical trials. Thus, the use of indapamide as a leading diuretic agent may be worthwhile.

### Benazepril plus amlodipine or hydrochlorothiazide for hypertension in high-risk patients [^ffddeaa1]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2008). Excellent credibility.

The study ACCOMPLISH was published by Jamerson K and colleagues in 2008 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Hypertension. In the ACCOMPLISH study, the trial question was: is benazepril plus amlodipine superior to benazepril plus hydrochlorothiazide in patients with hypertension who are at high-risk for cardiovascular events? In the ACCOMPLISH study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the ACCOMPLISH study, the population was: 11506 patients (4543 female, 6963 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with hypertension who were at high risk for cardiovascular events. The key exclusion criteria were acute coronary syndromes, or coronary revascularizations within 1 month of the first visit; stroke or other ischemic cerebrovascular episodes within 3 months preceding study evaluation; or hypertension that is excessively severe, known to be refractory to treatment, or known to have a secondary cause. In the ACCOMPLISH study, the interventions were: n=5744 benazepril-amlodipine (20 mg benazepril and 5 mg amlodipine) n=5762 benazepril-hydrochlorothiazide (20 mg benazepril and 12.5 mg hydrochlorothiazide). In the ACCOMPLISH study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in the rate of cardiovascular events and death from cardiovascular causes, at a mean follow-up of 36 months (9.6% vs. 11.8%; HR 0.8, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.9). In the ACCOMPLISH study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and nonfatal stroke (5% vs. 6.3%; HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.92) Significant decrease in cardiovascular events (8.6% vs. 10.3%; HR 0.83, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.93). In the ACCOMPLISH study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in dry cough (20.5% vs. 21.2%) and hyperkalemia (0.6% vs. 0.6%). significant differences in peripheral edema (31.2% vs. 13.4%), dizziness (20.7% vs. 25.4%), and hypotension (2.5% vs. 3.6%). In the ACCOMPLISH study, the conclusion was: in patients with hypertension who were at high risk for cardiovascular events, benazepril-amlodipine was superior to benazepril-hydrochlorothiazide with respect to the rate of cardiovascular events and death from cardiovascular causes, at a mean follow-up of 36 months.

### Spironolactone and hydrochlorothiazide [^278ec546]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Essential hypertension:

For patients with essential hypertension in whom other measures are considered inadequate or inappropriate;
In hypertensive patients for the treatment of a diuretic-induced hypokalemia when other measures are considered inappropriate;
Spironolactone and hydrochlorothiazide tablets are indicated for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes, including the classes to which this drug principally belongs. There are no controlled trials demonstrating risk reduction with spironolactone and hydrochlorothiazide tablets.

Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than one drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program’s Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC).

Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly.

Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal.

Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy.

### Effects of blood pressure lowering on outcome incidence in hypertension: 4. effects of various classes of antihypertensive drugs – overview and meta-analyses [^120aadb7]. Journal of Hypertension (2015). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

In 68 randomized controlled trials (RCTs), blood pressure (BP) lowering was obtained by using drugs of different classes. We have investigated whether BP lowering by any of the major drug classes is effective in reducing the cardiovascular outcomes.

Methods

A total of 55 RCTs (19,5267 individuals) were suitable for drug-class meta-analyses. Risk ratios and their 95% confidence intervals of seven fatal and nonfatal outcomes were estimated by a random-effects model.

Results

Twelve RCTs (48,898 patients) compared a diuretic with no treatment. SBP/DBP differences of about -12/-5 mmHg were accompanied by significant reductions of all outcomes, including mortality. The same results were obtained by limiting analyses to eight RCTs using low-dose diuretics. Separate analyses for thiazides, chlorthalidone and indapamide (all low dose) showed each subclass was associated with significant reduction of some major outcome. Five RCTs (18,724 patients; SBP/DBP difference -10.5/-7 mmHg) showed beta-blockers significantly reduced stroke, heart failure and major cardiovascular events. In RCTs comparing calcium antagonists, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) with placebo smaller SBP/DBP differences were achieved, mostly because in the majority of these later RCTs the antihypertensive drug and placebo were added on a background treatment with other antihypertensive agents. Nonetheless, significant reductions of stroke, major cardiovascular events, cardiovascular and all-cause death were obtained with calcium antagonists (10 RCTs, 30,359 patients); stroke, coronary heart disease, heart failure and major cardiovascular events by ACE inhibitors (12 RCTs, 35,707 patients); and stroke, heart failure and major cardiovascular events by ARBs (13 RCTs, 65,256 patients).

Conclusion

BP lowering by all classes of antihypertensive drugs is accompanied by significant reductions of stroke and major cardiovascular events. This supports the concept that reduction of these events is because of BP lowering per se rather than specific drug properties. However, evidence of risk reduction of other events and particularly mortality was obtained so far with some drug classes only. As a result of marked differences in the trial design, total cardiovascular risk, SBP/DBP differences and statistical power, comparisons of meta-analyses of different drug-specific placebo-controlled RCTs appear unwarranted.

### Comparative effectiveness of antihypertensive medication for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: systematic review and multiple treatments meta-analysis [^3adfec74]. BMC Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Methods

Protocol

Methods for this review were specified in advance, and registered in the PROSPERO-database.

Eligibility criteria

We only included randomized controlled trials comparing one or more drugs against each other, or no active treatment. Since our focus was on primary prevention, that is, the participants should be free from cardiovascular disease, we pragmatically excluded trials where more than half the participants had had a myocardial infarction, stroke or other significant cardiovascular event. We also excluded studies done exclusively in selected subgroups of patients with hypertension, for example, patients with diabetes or microalbuminuria.

Only trials of drugs belonging to commonly used "drug-classes" were included: Diuretics, beta-blockers, calcium-channel blockers (CCB), angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-inhibitors), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB), and alpha-blockers. Because we were only interested in studies of "low-dose" diuretics, we excluded trials where the maximum dosage in the treatment protocol was higher than the "optimal range" as proposed by the Joint National Committee U.S. guidelines and the authors of a recent Cochrane review.

To be considered for inclusion, a trial had to have cardiovascular morbidity or mortality as a primary outcome, either explicitly stated by the authors or based on our judgement. In practice, this meant excluding many smaller studies, typically designed to evaluate effects on surrogate outcomes such as blood pressure. Some of these trials reported morbidity and mortality outcomes in addition to their primary surrogate outcome. We disregarded these data in the belief that the information was not likely to be important given the availability of findings from large-scale studies with morbidity and mortality as the main outcomes. By doing this, we also reduced the risk of introducing certain biases in our analyses, for example, due to selective reporting of findings, which is likely to be a greater problem with smaller studies.

Information sources and search

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, AMED (up to February 2011) and CENTRAL (up to May 2009). See Additional file 1 for the complete search strategy. We also studied the reference lists in recent systematic reviews. We did not apply any language re-strictions.

Study selection

We first assessed the relevance of titles and abstracts that the search yielded. Secondly, potentially relevant articles were assessed in full text. At each step two reviewers made independent assessments.

Data collection process

Data extraction was done independently by two reviewers using a simple, standardized form.

### Chlorthalidone vs hydrochlorothiazide for hypertension treatment after myocardial infarction or stroke: a secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^a7675712]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Thiazide diuretics are commonly used to treat hypertension, as they both lower blood pressure (BP) and prevent cardiovascular (CV) events. Currently, they are recommended as first-line agents.There are mechanistic reasons that suggest chlorthalidone (CTD) may be superior to hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) for preventing CV outcomes. Chlorthalidone has a longer half-life and has been shown to be more effective in reducing 24-hour BP compared with HCTZ.Chlorthalidone also has other pleotropic effects, such as decreased platelet aggregation and vascular permeability mediated through inhibition of carbonic anhydrase.However, most thiazide prescriptions in the US are HCTZ rather than CTD,potentially because of adverse effects associated with CTD, such as hypokalemia.

The Diuretic Comparison Project (DCP) was a pragmatic randomized clinical trial (RCT) comparing CTD with HCTZ for the treatment of hypertension to reduce major adverse CV events (MACEs) and noncancer deaths in older US veterans.A planned subgroup analysis involved comparing drug effects among participants with and without prior myocardial infarction (MI) or stroke to assess whether the effects differed when used for primary vs secondary CV prevention. The main trial results demonstrated no difference in effects between CTD and HCTZ on such outcomes when mostly low doses were used.However, there was a qualitative interaction between treatment group and baseline presence of MI or stroke. A qualitative interaction is when a treatment is beneficial in 1 subgroup but harmful in the other. The observed interaction was therefore unexpected and has not been described in prior studies, to our knowledge. We assessed whether treatment effects of CTD vs HCTZ associated with CV outcomes and adverse events were different in patients with prior MI or stroke and those without prior MI or stroke.

### Thiazide and the thiazide-like diuretics: review of hydrochlorothiazide, chlorthalidone, and indapamide [^ff39579b]. American Journal of Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

The term thiazide is universally understood to refer to diuretics that exert their principal action in the distal tubule. The thiazide class is heterogenous and can be further subdivided into compounds containing the benzothiadiazine ring structure-the thiazide-type (e.g., hydrochlorothiazide)-and those lacking the benzothiadiazine ring-the thiazide-like (e.g., chlorthalidone and indapamide) drugs. Thiazide-like agents are longer acting and constitute the diuretics used in most of the cardiovascular outcome trials that established benefits of treatment with diuretics, but pragmatic aspects, such as lack of availability in convenient formulations, limit their use. Regardless of class heterogeneity, thiazides have retained importance in the management of hypertension for over 60 years. They are reliably effective as monotherapy in a majority of hypertensive patients, and augment the efficacy of other classes of antihypertensives when used in combination. Importantly, a thiazide-based treatment regimen lowers cardiovascular events, and their sturdy effect reinforces their place among the recommended first-line agents to treat hypertension in major domestic and international hypertension guidelines. There are few head-to-head comparisons within the class, but potential differences have been explored indirectly as well as in non-blood pressure mechanisms and potential pleiotropic properties. Until proven otherwise, the importance of these differences remains speculative, and clinicians should assume that cardiovascular events will be lowered similarly across agents when equivalent blood pressure reduction occurs. Thiazides remain underutilized, with only about one-third of hypertensive patients receiving them. For many patients, however, a thiazide is an indispensable component of their regimen to achieve adequate blood pressure control.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of hypertension in the primary care setting [^09e87c68]. VA/DoD (2020). High credibility.

Hypertension in older adults—evidence and agent selection: In hypertensive patients over the age of 65, treatment with a thiazide-type diuretic compared to other treatment options has been shown to reduce a composite cardiovascular outcome which included heart failure and stroke. In this same meta-analysis, beta-blockers performed worse than all other therapies and CCBs, ACEIs, and ARBs had no significant difference in the composite outcome for patients over the age of 65 compared to other therapies. Large RCTs are consistent with this recommendation, specifically ALLHAT which is especially pertinent to VA/DoD providers due to the more than 7,000 Veterans included in the study, and ALLHAT enrolled patients age 55 and over and demonstrated improved CVD outcomes with chlorthalidone compared to amlodipine or lisinopril. Harms of thiazide-type diuretics versus other therapies were considered, but a meta-analysis of adverse events did not demonstrate any significant difference between thiazide-type diuretics and other therapies. The strongest trial evidence for improved CVD outcomes with thiazide-type diuretics involves chlorthalidone and indapamide, and in ACCOMPLISH, ACEI/CCB combination was favored over an ACEI/thiazide-type diuretic combination. The dose and type of the thiazide-type diuretic in ACCOMPLISH (hydrochlorothiazide [HCTZ] 12.5-25 mg/day) was lower than equipotent doses of chlorthalidone or indapamide, and for initial or add-on treatment of HTN, chlorthalidone and indapamide result in greater decreases of blood pressure compared to low doses (12.5-25 mg/day) of HCTZ; for these reasons, chlorthalidone or indapamide is preferred over HCTZ when choosing a thiazide-type diuretic.

### Prior medications and the cardiovascular benefits from combination angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition plus calcium channel blockade among high-risk hypertensive patients [^4131d573]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Antihypertensive therapy is well established to reduce the adverse cardiovascular consequences of high blood pressure (BP). 1 The overall evidence supports that the degree of BP lowering is the major determinant of the health benefits. 1 Guidelines, therefore, emphasize the importance of controlling BP as the preeminent goal. 2, 3 In this regard, it is important to acknowledge that most hypertensive patients (eg, 75%) require ≥2 antihypertensive medications to achieve BP targets. 4 As such, the most germane issue to explore in guiding present‐day clinical practice is which combination of medications (rather than what single agent) provides optimal cardiovascular protection. 5 Although most patients in clinical trials were taking >1 antihypertensive medication, 1 only the ACCOMPLISH (Avoiding Cardiovascular Events Through Combination Therapy in Patients Living with Systolic Hypertension) trial was designed to investigate the comparative cardiovascular risk reductions derived from 2 prespecified combination regimens prescribed as initial therapy. 6 The study was terminated early (mean follow‐up, 36 months) because of the superiority of benazepril+amlodipine compared with benazepril+hydrochlorothiazide for preventing the primary composite outcome (hazard ratio [HR], 0.80; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.72–0.90; P <0.001). Subsequent analyses showed that this benefit occurred among patients with coronary artery disease 7 and diabetes mellitus, 8 was superior for preventing adverse renal outcomes, 9 and was not likely a consequence of subtle BP differences between groups (ambulatory BP monitoring). 10

### Prior medications and the cardiovascular benefits from combination angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition plus calcium channel blockade among high-risk hypertensive patients [^9d87969e]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The ACCOMPLISH (Avoiding Cardiovascular Events Through Combination Therapy in Patients Living with Systolic Hypertension) trial demonstrated that combination therapy using amlodipine, rather than hydrochlorothiazide, in conjunction with benazepril provided greater cardiovascular risk reduction among high-risk hypertensive patients. Few trials have evaluated the effect of prior antihypertensive therapy used among participants on the study outcomes.

Methods and Results

In a post hoc observational analysis, we examined the characteristics of the drug regimens taken before trial enrollment in the context of the primary composite outcome (death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, hospitalization for angina, resuscitation after sudden cardiac death, and coronary revascularization). In the "primary subgroup" (n=4475), patients previously taking any renin-angiotensin system blockade plus either a diuretic or a calcium channel blocker alone or as part of their antihypertensive regimen, there were 206 of 2193 (9.4%) versus 281 of 2282 (12.3%) primary composite events among those randomized to combination therapy involving amlodipine versus hydrochlorothiazide, respectively (adjusted Cox proportional hazard ratio, 0.74; 95% confidence interval, 0.62-0.89; P =0.0015). All other participants (n=6975) previously taking any antihypertensive regimen not included in the primary subgroup also benefited from randomization to amlodipine plus benazepril (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.84; 95% confidence interval, 0.72-0.98; P =0.024). Outcomes among most other subgroups, including patients previously taking lipid-lowering medications or dichotomized by prior blood pressure control status, showed similar results.

Conclusions

When combined with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, amlodipine provides cardiovascular risk reduction superior to hydrochlorothiazide, largely regardless of prior medication use. These findings add further support for the initial use of this combination regimen among high-risk hypertensive patients.

### Effectiveness of initiating treatment with valsartan / hydrochlorothiazide in patients with stage-1 or stage-2 hypertension [^cb9f0ea9]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2010). Low credibility.

In the Valsartan Antihypertensive Long-term Use Evaluation (VALUE) study, which compared the CV outcomes of 15 314 eligible patients randomized to a valsartan or an amlodipine-based treatment, higher odds ratios in favour of amlodipine were noted for all endpoints during the first 6 months, when BP differences between the treatment groups were greatest.The starting dose of valsartan in the VALUE trial was 80 mg. Patients remained on the valsartan 80-mg dose for at least 1 month (4 weeks) before being up-titrated to the next step in the protocol. In our current study, initiating treatment with higher dose valsartan monotherapy (160 mg) was associated with higher BP control rates and a shortened time to reach BP control as compared with low-dose valsartan (80 mg) monotherapy, but the BP differences were largely influenced by addition of low-dose HCTZ at week 4 (Figure 4). Perhaps the early outcomes of the VALUE trial were not favourable for valsartan as the trial not only underestimated the proportion of patients requiring combination therapy, but also underutilized the add-on of HCTZ (40% of patients in the trial stayed on valsartan monotherapy, with only 70% of those patients having their BP controlled).

Studies with initial combination therapy using an ARB and low-dose HCTZ have demonstrated superior BP control rates and BP-lowering efficacy as compared with initiating therapy with monotherapy in patients with stage-2 hypertension or diabetes.,,, There is a consensus that initial combination therapy works for high-risk patients with stage-2 hypertension; however, this does not have current support as an optional treatment approach for wider use in primary hypertension.Evidence supporting initial use of combination therapy for patients with stage-1 hypertension largely comes from recent findings from the ACCOMPLISH study.Over 9000 patients with stage-1 or stage-2 hypertension were initiated with ACE-inhibitor+HCTZ or ACE-inhibitor+amlodipine combination therapy. The study demonstrated that use of initial combination therapy was very effective and safe for both stage-1 and stage-2 hypertension, as it reported some of the highest BP control rates for any large outcomes study.

General implementation notes for initial drug choice clarify that “many people will require treatment with more than one antihypertensive drug to achieve BP control,” and “the panel suggests that any of these 4 classes would be good choices as add-on therapy.” The text specifies that “this recommendation is specific for thiazide-type diuretics, which include chlorthalidone, hydrochlorothiazide, and indapamide; it does not include loop or potassium-sparing diuretics,” and emphasizes that “it is important that β-blockers be dosed adequately to achieve results similar to those seen in the RCTs.” It also states that “RCTs that were limited to specific nonhypertensive populations, such as those with coronary artery disease or heart failure, were not used to formulate this recommendation” and concludes that “Therefore, recommendation 6 should be applied with caution to these populations.”

### Use of blood pressure lowering drugs in the prevention of cardiovascular disease: meta-analysis of 147 randomised trials in the context of expectations from prospective epidemiological studies [^b8fbefdd]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Drug comparison trials

Figure 4for CHD and web figures 4a-e show the results of the drug comparison trials comparing each of the five main classes of drug with drugs from the other classes. The summary relative risk estimates for CHD events were close to 1.0, indicating no advantage of any one drug over others in the prevention of CHD. The differences between classes of drug in average blood pressure reductions were close to zero (fig 4), and the differences in use of add-on drugs were negligible (0.03 or fewer drugs per participant).The different classes of drug therefore reduced blood pressure to about the same extent and reduced CHD to about the same extent, providing evidence of a lack of preventive effects attributable to mechanisms other than lowering blood pressure.

Fig 4 Relative risk estimates of coronary heart disease events and stroke in 46 drug comparison trials comparing each of the five classes of blood pressure lowering drug with any other class of drug (excluding CHD events in trials of β blockers in people with a history of coronary heart disease; see web extra figures 4a-j for individual trial results and summary estimates)

In the drug comparison trials the overall risk reduction in CHD events with thiazides was similar to that of other classes of drug (fig 4). There was, however, an increased risk of sudden cardiac death from using thiazides in very high dose, concealed in the summary results because few of the thiazide trials used very high doses and because sudden cardiac deaths were a small proportion of all CHD events. In trials in which the thiazide dose was high (≥4 times the standard dose) there were 33 sudden cardiac deaths in participants allocated thiazides and 16 in those allocated other drugs (with similar numbers of participants in each group): relative risk 2.1 (P=0.01). w125 w163 In trials using doses between standard and twice standard, 57 and 40 sudden cardiac deaths occurred, respectively (relative risk 1.4), w15 w128 w130 w134 and in trials using around half standard dose there were 16 and 19 sudden cardiac deaths (relative risk 0.8; w127 w131 w133 ; P for trend 0.058). These results indicate that higher doses of thiazides probably cause sudden death, and prospective observational studies of people taking and not taking thiazides show the same (attributable to lower serum potassium levels causing ventricular arrhythmias).

### Chlorthalidone vs hydrochlorothiazide for hypertension treatment after myocardial infarction or stroke: a secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^1d667569]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Hypokalemia has been associated with an increased risk of adverse CV outcomes., A meta-analysis of 13 cohort studies suggested a progressively increasing risk for mortality associated with hypokalemia starting at a potassium value of 3.5 mEq/L.Hypokalemia and its association with an increased risk for CV outcomes have been limiting factors for the use of high-dose diuretic therapy. A meta-analysis of 18 RCTs comparing high-dose vs low-dose diuretic therapy demonstrated a reduction in coronary heart disease and all-cause mortality associated with low-dose diuretics.Similarly, a secondary analysis of the Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly Program trial, which compared CTD with placebo in older individuals, demonstrated an increased risk of CV events in those taking CTD who developed hypokalemia (potassium level <3.5 mEq/L) compared with those who did not.The DCP trial was a pragmatic RCT with the assumption being that the doses of CTD and HCTZ were pharmacologically comparable. This was demonstrated by similar clinical BP values observed over the course of the trial. We also assumed that hypokalemia would be the same between groups and managed similarly, but this was not the case, as evidenced by the increased incidence of a nadir potassium level less than 3.1 mEq/L associated with CTD both overall in the DCP trial and specifically in participants without a prior MI or stroke. It is unclear why those with a prior MI or stroke had a greater incidence of mild hypokalemia but no greater incidence of moderate to severe hypokalemia or hospitalization for hypokalemia in the CTD group compared with the HCTZ group. Generally, patients were taking similar doses of HCTZ at baseline (6379 of 6756 [94.4%] and 6402 of 6767 [94.6%] were receiving 25 mg of HCTZ at baseline in the CTD and HCTZ group, respectively), and there was no difference in BP between treatment groups over the trial duration. Additionally, while those with prior MI or stroke were more likely to be taking an ACE inhibitor, ARB, and/or MRA at baseline, use of these classes of medications did not substantially change over the study course. On average, those in the group with prior MI or stroke had a greater number of outpatient visits over the duration of the study. The difference in use of potassium supplements without severe hypokalemia may have been the result of greater recognition of mild hypokalemia and greater treatment associated with the greater frequency of visits in this high-risk subgroup. However, the absolute number of moderate to severe hypokalemic events was greater in this group compared with the group without prior MI or stroke.

### Combination therapy in hypertension: an update [^201e5329]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2010). Low credibility.

ACEIs/ARBs with Diuretics

RAAS inhibitor and a diuretic combination will offset the diuretic-induced increase in plasma renin activity. The salt loss will add to the antihypertensive effect of RAAS blocker. Besides, an ARB will also attenuate the metabolic effects of thiazide diuretics like hypokalemia and hyperglycemia. Several studies have demonstrated the antihypertensive effectiveness of this combination in low doses, showing substantially greater reductions in BP and higher response rates than either of the treatments alone.

The Action in Diabetes and Vascular Disease: Preterax and Diamicron MR Controlled Evaluation (ADVANCE), trial compared the effects of BP lowering with a perindopril/indapamide combination or placebo, in high-risk type 2 diabetic subjects. The risk of combined primary outcome, a major macrovascular or microvascular event was reduced by 9% (p = 0.041) with a 14% (p = 0.025) reduction in all-cause mortality and an 18% (p = 0.027) reduction in cardiovascular mortality. The study extrapolated saving one death over 5 years for every 79 patients with this ACEI/Diuretic combination. Similarly clinical studies have shown combination of the ARB, irbesartan with HCTZ to be safe and effective in patients with moderate to severe hypertension, irrespective of baseline BP level, age, obesity, race, diabetic status, and the metabolic syndrome and has a significantly greater dose-dependent BP lowering effect than either agent alone. One study suggested that although a goal BP of < 140/90 mm Hg can be reached in the majority of patients with SBP < 160 mm Hg with irbesartan monotherapy, most patients with moderate to severe (stage 27 or grade 2 or 3) hypertension (baseline SBP ≥ 160 mm Hg) require combination therapy for BP goal to be reached.

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Combination therapy and SPCs—Combination therapy “is more effective, efficient, and consistent in lowering BP and improves adherence when using an SPC compared with stepped-care therapy,” though “a stepped-care approach can be effective for BP lowering if well-executed.” “Initial combination therapy is recommended for stage 2 hypertension and some high-risk patients with stage 1 hypertension (eg, non-Hispanic Black adults, ASCVD risk >7.5%) using 2 agents from different classes, preferably in an SPC to improve adherence and BP control.” For candidates for initial combination therapy, thresholds include “SBP ≥20 mm Hg and DBP ≥10 mm Hg above their goal,” and “starting treatment with SPCs rather than equivalent free-pill combinations improves adherence.” “Available RCT evidence supports using an RAS blocker with either a thiazide-type diuretic or a dihydropyridine CCB as initial therapy.” “Several small RCTs have demonstrated that low-dose combinations of 3 or 4 drugs together reduce BP more effectively than monotherapy over 3 to 6 months of treatment; however, none of these trials have evaluated CVD prevention.” “In general, initial combination therapy with 2 drugs is reasonable in adults with stage 2 hypertension and those at high CVD risk.” “However, BP-lowering medications should be carefully initiated and monitored in older patients because hypotension or orthostatic hypotension (OH) may develop.”

### Thiazide diuretics in the treatment of hypertension: an update [^f7e1d923]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2006). Low credibility.

Thiazide diuretics were the first tolerated efficient antihypertensive drugs that significantly reduced cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in placebo-controlled clinical studies. Although these drugs today still are considered a fundamental therapeutic tool for the treatment of hypertensive patients, the following considerations should be taken into account. Although there are some indications that chlorthalidone can offer additional advantages as compared with other compounds, a recent meta-analysis of placebo-controlled trials suggested that the beneficial effects of thiazide diuretics could be a class effect. Thiazide diuretics must be used at appropriate and/or optimal doses to achieve the optimal antihypertensive effect with the smallest occurrence of side effects, including alterations in glucose and lipid profiles and hypokalemia. Moreover, because thiazide diuretics can increase the incidence of new-onset diabetes, especially when combined with beta blockers, caution is advised in using these drugs above all in patients who are at high risk for developing diabetes, in whom thiazide diuretics should be used at the lowest active dose and possibly in combination with drugs that block the renin-angiotensin system. Finally, the current debate on whether thiazide diuretics are the first-choice drug for most patients with uncomplicated hypertension, as stated in the Seventh Joint National Committee Report, or are included in the major classes of antihypertensive agents that are suitable for initiation and maintenance of therapy, as reported in the European Society of Hypertension-European Society of Cardiology Guidelines, derives from different interpretations of controlled clinical trial data on drug class comparison and of cost-benefit analyses. However, considering that the benefit of antihypertensive drugs seems to be due principally to BP lowering per se without definitive evidence of the superiority of a particular drug class and that there is no cost-benefit analysis showing the superiority of thiazide diuretics, it is believed that these drugs should not be considered as the only first-choice drug but included among first-choice drugs.

### Effects of thiazide-type and thiazide-like diuretics on cardiovascular events and mortality: systematic review and meta-analysis [^63faad93]. Hypertension (2015). Low credibility.

Thiazide diuretics are recommended as first-line therapy for hypertension and are among the most commonly prescribed drugs worldwide. According to their molecular structure, thiazide diuretics can be divided in thiazide-type (TT) and thiazide-like (TL) diuretics. TL diuretics have a longer elimination half-life compared with TT diuretics and have been shown to exert additional pharmacological effects, which may differently affect cardiovascular risk. In this meta-analysis, we compared the effects of TT and TL diuretics on cardiovascular events and mortality. Randomized, controlled studies in adult hypertensive patients that compared TT or TL diuretics with placebo or antihypertensive drugs and had ≥1 year follow-up were included. Primary outcome was cardiovascular events; secondary outcomes included coronary events, heart failure, cerebrovascular events, and all-cause mortality. Meta-regression analysis was used to identify confounders and correct for the achieved blood pressure reductions. Twenty-one studies with >480000 patient-years were included. Outcomes were not affected by heterogeneity in age, sex, and ethnicity among included studies, whereas larger blood pressure reductions were significantly associated with increased risk reductions for all outcomes (P<0.001). Corrected for differences in office blood pressure reductions among trials, TL diuretics resulted in a 12% additional risk reduction for cardiovascular events (P=0.049) and a 21% additional risk reduction for heart failure (P=0.023) when compared with TT diuretics. The incidence of adverse events was comparable among TT, TL diuretics, and other antihypertensive therapy. Our data suggest that the best available evidence seems to favor TL diuretics as the drug of choice when thiazide treatment is considered for hypertension.

REAFFIRMING THE PLACE OF DIURETICS IN HYPERTENSION AND COMORBIDITIES

A first-line treatment in guidelines

Guidelines throughout the world list diuretics as one of the first-line treatments for patients with essential hypertension. This choice is based on the observation that a wide range of patients can benefit from diuretics, which counter the extracellular volume expansion and the salt retention associated with hypertension and reduce morbidity and mortality. For most patients, the risk of a clinically meaningful change in laboratory parameters is rather low, whereas the clinical benefits of diuretics are high.

The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) hypertension guidelines, for instance, name the reduction of clinical events as the main criterion for endorsing any antihypertensive medication and cite results of meta-analyses that show that diuretics perform as well as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, calcium channel blockers (CCB), and angiotensin receptor blockers (Fig. 1). These meta-analyses include key randomized controlled trials, such as the Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT; N = 33 357), which is of particular interest because it compared the long-term effects of treatment with chlorthalidone, amlodipine, and lisinopril. In this cohort of hypertensive patients who had at least one other coronary heart disease risk factor, no significant between-group differences were found for the primary outcome (combined fatal coronary heart disease or nonfatal myocardial infarction) or for all-cause mortality. Higher fasting glucose levels were observed with chlorthalidone, but there was no conclusive evidence that the modestly increased risk of developing diabetes mellitus resulted in an increased risk of other clinical events.

### Losartan potassium and hydrochlorothiazide [^3d66af88]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Of the randomized patients, 4963 (54%) were female and 533 (6%) were Black. The mean age was 67 with 5704 (62%) age ≥65. At baseline, 1195 (13%) had diabetes, 1326 (14%) had isolated systolic hypertension, 1469 (16%) had coronary heart disease, and 728 (8%) had cerebrovascular disease. Baseline mean blood pressure was 174/98 mmHg in both treatment groups. The mean length of follow-up was 4.8 years. At the end of study or at the last visit before a primary endpoint, 77% of the group treated with losartan and 73% of the group treated with atenolol were still taking study medication. Of the patients still taking study medication, the mean doses of losartan and atenolol were both about 80 mg/day, and 15% were taking atenolol or losartan as monotherapy, while 77% were also receiving hydrochlorothiazide (at a mean dose of 20 mg/day in each group). Blood pressure reduction measured at trough was similar for both treatment groups but blood pressure was not measured at any other time of the day. At the end of study or at the last visit before a primary endpoint, the mean blood pressures were 144.1/81.3 mmHg for the group treated with losartan and 145.4/80.9 mmHg for the group treated with atenolol [the difference in SBP of 1.3 mmHg was significant (p<0.001), while the difference of 0.4 mmHg in DBP was not significant (p=0.098)].

The primary endpoint was the first occurrence of cardiovascular death, nonfatal stroke, or nonfatal myocardial infarction. Patients with nonfatal events remained in the trial, so that there was also an examination of the first event of each type even if it was not the first event (e.g., a stroke following an initial myocardial infarction would be counted in the analysis of stroke). Treatment with losartan resulted in a 13% reduction (p=0.021) in risk of the primary endpoint compared to the atenolol group; this difference was primarily the result of an effect on fatal and nonfatal stroke. Treatment with losartan reduced the risk of stroke by 25% relative to atenolol (p=0.001).

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Blood pressure targets and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) considerations—harms with an SBP <130 mm Hg were infrequent, with numbers needed to harm ranging from 508 for hypotension to 3222 for electrolyte abnormalities, and support for SBP <120 mm Hg versus <140 mm Hg was further demonstrated. In adults at high risk for CVD, participants in 2 trials were randomized to a DBP <80 mm Hg versus higher DBP antihypertensive treatment goal; in one of these trials, CVD risk and all-cause mortality were significantly reduced in the participants randomized to the lower compared with the higher DBP, while the other was substantially underpowered but showed a consistent, albeit nonsignificant, reduction. Across randomized comparisons, CVD outcomes and all-cause mortality were better in those randomized to an SBP goal of <120 versus <140 for every quintile of baseline DBP, including those with the lowest starting DBP (<68 mm Hg); although there is no cutoff for level of DBP during antihypertensive treatment, careful monitoring of symptoms and attention to changes in eGFR are important. In the PREVER-Prevention trial of adults not at high risk for CVD with an average DBP between 80 and 89 mm Hg, once-daily low-dose chlorthalidone (12.5 mg) and amiloride (2.5 mg) significantly lowered BP, prevented hypertension, and reduced left ventricular mass compared with placebo, and although this is an intermediate endpoint, the results support lowering DBP and are consistent with guidance for those with a high lifetime risk of CVD, including young adults.

### First-line combination therapy versus first-line monotherapy for primary hypertension [^ac07c61d]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

This is the first update of a review originally published in 2017. Starting with one drug and starting with a combination of two drugs are strategies suggested in clinical guidelines as initial treatment of hypertension. The recommendations are not based on evidence about clinically relevant outcomes. Some antihypertensive combinations have been shown to be harmful. The actual harm-to-benefit balance of each strategy is unknown.

Objectives

To determine if there are differences in clinical outcomes between monotherapy and combination therapy as initial treatment for primary hypertension.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomised controlled trials up to April 2019: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (from 2005), Embase (from 1974), the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials.gov. We used no language restrictions. We also searched clinical studies repositories of pharmaceutical companies, reviews of combination drugs on the US Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency websites, and lists of references in reviews and clinical practice guidelines.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised, double-blind trials with at least 12 months' follow-up in adults with primary hypertension (systolic blood pressure/diastolic blood pressure 140/90 mmHg or higher, or 130/80 mmHg or higher if participants had diabetes), which compared combination of two first-line antihypertensive drugs with monotherapy as initial treatment. Trials had to include at least 50 participants per group and report mortality, cardiovascular mortality, cardiovascular events, or serious adverse events.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, evaluated the risk of bias, and performed data entry. The primary outcomes were mortality, serious adverse events, cardiovascular events, and cardiovascular mortality. Secondary outcomes were withdrawals due to drug-related adverse effects, reaching blood pressure control (as defined in each trial), and blood pressure change from baseline. Analyses were based on the intention-to-treat principle. We summarised data on dichotomous outcomes as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

This update included one new study in which a subgroup of participants met our inclusion criteria. As none of the four included studies focused solely on people initiating antihypertensive treatment, we asked investigators for data for this subgroup. One study (PREVER-treatment 2016) used a combination of thiazide-type diuretic/potassium-sparing diuretic; as the former is not indicated in monotherapy, we analysed this study separately. The three original trials in the main comparison (monotherapy: 335 participants; combination therapy: 233 participants) included outpatients, mostly European and white people. Two trials only included people with type 2 diabetes; the remaining trial excluded people treated with diabetes, hypocholesterolaemia, or cardiovascular drugs. The follow-up was 12 months in two trials and 36 months in one trial. It is very uncertain whether combination therapy versus monotherapy reduces total mortality (RR 1.35, 95% CI 0.08 to 21.72), cardiovascular mortality (zero events reported), cardiovascular events (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.22 to 4.41), serious adverse events (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.92), or withdrawals due to adverse effects (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.35); all outcomes had 568 participants, and the evidence was rated as of very low certainty due to serious imprecision and for using a subgroup that was not defined in advance. The confidence intervals were extremely wide for all important outcomes and included both appreciable harm and benefit. The PREVER-treatment 2016 trial, which used a combination therapy with potassium-sparing diuretic (monotherapy: 84 participants; combination therapy: 116 participants), included outpatients. This trial was conducted in Brazil and had a follow-up of 18 months. The number of events was very low and confidence intervals very wide, with zero events reported for cardiovascular mortality and withdrawals due to adverse events. It is very uncertain if there are differences in clinical outcomes between monotherapy and combination therapy in this trial.

Authors' Conclusions

The numbers of included participants, and hence the number of events, were too small to draw any conclusion about the relative efficacy of monotherapy versus combination therapy as initial treatment for primary hypertension. There is a need for large clinical trials that address the review question and report clinically relevant endpoints.

Chronic coronary disease (CCD) with hypertension—treatment targets and drug classes: “Reducing SBP to <130 mm Hg can lower cardiovascular risk and mortality in adults with CCD and hypertension.” When SBP is already below this threshold, “when SBP is <130 mm Hg, a DBP between 70 and 80 mm Hg is associated with reduced cardiovascular events without an increase in serious adverse events.” Regarding therapies, “ACEi, ARB, and BB have been shown to reduce CVD events and all-cause death in adults with CCD and hypertension,” though “Conflicting evidence exists regarding the long-term use of BB therapy (>1 year).” If further agents are required, “If additional antihypertensive medications are needed to achieve BP control, CCBs, thiazide-type diuretics, and/or MRA are recommended.”

Summary of evidence

A meta-analysis by Psaty summarized the available clinical trial evidence concerning the safety and efficacy of various antihypertensive therapies used as first-line agents in terms of major cardiovascular disease endpoints and all-cause mortality. Network meta-analysis was used to combine direct within-trial between-drug comparisons with indirect evidence from other trials. Indirect comparisons preserving within-trial randomized findings were constructed from trials that had one treatment in common. Data were combined from 42 clinical trials that included 192,478 patients randomized to 7 major treatment strategies, including placebo. For all outcomes, low-dose diuretics were superior to placebo for coronary heart disease (CHD; RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.69–0.92); congestive heart failure (CHF; RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.42–0.62); stroke (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.63–0.81); CV events (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.69–0.83); CV mortality (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.73–0.92); and total mortality (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.84–0.96). None of the first-line treatment strategies—beta blockers, ACE inhibitors, calcium channel blockers (CCBs), alpha blockers, and angiotensin receptor blockers—was significantly better than low-dose diuretics for any outcome. Compared with CCBs, low-dose diuretics were associated with reduced risks of CV events (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.89–1.00) and CHF (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.67–0.81). Compared with ACE inhibitors, low-dose diuretics were associated with reduced risks of CHF (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.80–0.96), CV events (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.89–1.00), and stroke (RR 0.86, 0.77–0.97). Compared with beta blockers, low-dose diuretics were associated with a reduced risk of CV events (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.80–0.98). Compared with alpha blockers, low-dose diuretics were associated with reduced risks of CHF (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.43–0.60) and CV events (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.75–0.93). Blood pressure changes were similar between comparison treatments. Low-dose diuretics were the most effective first-line treatment for preventing the occurrence of CV-related morbidity and mortality.

### Cardiovascular outcomes in hypertensive patients: comparing single-agent therapy with combination therapy [^4e3a54e8]. Journal of Hypertension (2012). Low credibility.

Objectives

To determine whether blood pressure (BP) control in hypertensive patients achieved with combination drug therapy provides the same cardiovascular benefits as with single-agent therapy.

Background

Drug combinations, most often including hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ), are now recommended for routine BP management, but their effects on cardiovascular event rates have not been compared with effective monotherapy.

Methods

We conducted retrospective analyses of the Valsartan Antihypertensive Long-term Use Evaluation (VALUE) data. VALUE compared cardiovascular event rates of valsartan and amlodipine. Patients with BPs not controlled (<140/90 mmHg) by the single agents had HCTZ and, if required, additional drugs of different classes, added. Using data pooled from the two treatment arms, we have now divided patients into those controlled on monotherapy and those controlled or not controlled by combination therapy. The primary study endpoint was first occurrence of cardiovascular death or nonfatal myocardial infarction or stroke. Comparisons between groups were by Cox regression, adjusted for on-treatment BP, age, prior cardiovascular events and left ventricular hypertrophy; the comparison between the monotherapy and combination therapy controlled groups was based on events occurring after 3 months by when the decision to use monotherapy or combination therapy was made.

Results

The primary endpoint occurred in 505 of 5924 (8.5%) monotherapy and 511 of 4621 (11.1%) combination therapy controlled patients: hazard ratio was 0.80 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.70-0.90]. If these two groups were matched for baseline BPs and all events included from study baseline, the hazard ratio was 0.76 (95% CI 0.67-0.86). The difference between combination controlled and uncontrolled [434 of 3390 (12.8%)] groups was not significant [hazard ratio 0.90 (95% CI 0.80-1.03], nor when they were matched for baseline BPs [hazard ratio 0.95 (95% CI 0.81-1.11)].

Conclusion

Independent of prior cardiovascular history or baseline BP, hypertensive patients requiring combination therapy, which includes a thiazide diuretic for BP control, have a poorer cardiovascular prognosis than those controlled by monotherapy and only a nonsignificantly lower event rate than noncontrolled patients.

### The combination therapy of hypertension to prevent cardiovascular events (COPE) trial: rationale and design [^9dd4fd38]. Hypertension Research (2005). Low credibility.

A number of major clinical trials have demonstrated the clinical benefits of lowering blood pressure and have indicated that a majority of patients with hypertension will require more than one drug to achieve optimal blood pressure control. However, there is little data showing which antihypertensive combination best protects patients from cardiovascular events and which best achieves the target blood pressure with the fewest adverse events. The Combination Therapy of Hypertension to Prevent Cardiovascular Events (COPE) trial is the first large-scale investigator-initiated multicenter study with a prospective, randomized, open, blinded endpoint evaluation (PROBE) design to directly compare cardiovascular mortality and morbidity, incidence of adverse drug reaction, and degree of blood pressure reduction in Japanese hypertensive patients for a combination of angiotensin receptor blockers, beta-blockers or thiazide diuretics in addition to a calcium antagonist, benidipine hydrochloride, with a response-dependent dose titration scheme. The COPE trial is being conducted with the cooperation of more than 100 centers and clinics in Japan and involves 3,000 patients, who will be followed for 3 years. Eligible patients are being enrolled from May 2003 until May 2006. Results from the COPE trial should provide new evidence for selecting optimal combination therapies for hypertensive patients.

### Prior medications and the cardiovascular benefits from combination angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition plus calcium channel blockade among high-risk hypertensive patients [^49adaf42]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The(Avoiding Cardiovascular Events Through Combination Therapy in Patients Living with Systolic Hypertension) trial demonstrated that combination therapy using amlodipine, rather than hydrochlorothiazide, in conjunction with benazepril provided greater cardiovascular risk reduction among high‐risk hypertensive patients. Few trials have evaluated the effect of prior antihypertensive therapy used among participants on the study outcomes.

Methods and Results

In a post hoc observational analysis, we examined the characteristics of the drug regimens taken before trial enrollment in the context of the primary composite outcome (death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, hospitalization for angina, resuscitation after sudden cardiac death, and coronary revascularization). In the “primary subgroup” (n=4475), patients previously taking any renin‐angiotensin system blockade plus either a diuretic or a calcium channel blocker alone or as part of their antihypertensive regimen, there were 206 of 2193 (9.4%) versus 281 of 2282 (12.3%) primary composite events among those randomized to combination therapy involving amlodipine versus hydrochlorothiazide, respectively (adjusted Cox proportional hazard ratio, 0.74; 95% confidence interval, 0.62–0.89; P =0.0015). All other participants (n=6975) previously taking any antihypertensive regimen not included in the primary subgroup also benefited from randomization to amlodipine plus benazepril (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.84; 95% confidence interval, 0.72–0.98; P =0.024). Outcomes among most other subgroups, including patients previously taking lipid‐lowering medications or dichotomized by prior blood pressure control status, showed similar results.

Conclusions

When combined with an angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitor, amlodipine provides cardiovascular risk reduction superior to hydrochlorothiazide, largely regardless of prior medication use. These findings add further support for the initial use of this combination regimen among high‐risk hypertensive patients.

### Use of blood pressure lowering drugs in the prevention of cardiovascular disease: meta-analysis of 147 randomised trials in the context of expectations from prospective epidemiological studies [^089083e3]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Adverse effects

Adverse effects are also a reason for seeking to individualise treatment. Tolerability, however, is minimised by using low dose combination therapy, as the prevalence of symptoms for three of the classes of drug is strongly related to dose,and low dose combination therapy can greatly improve safety. For example, the risk of sudden cardiac death was avoided using thiazides in low dose in the trials, probably because thiazides cause little reduction in serum potassium at half standard dose,and using thiazides in combination with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers, which increase serum potassium levels, counters the potential hazard.The diabetogenic effect of thiazides is strongly related to dose, and minor at low dose (the increase in blood glucose is 1% at half standard dose, 3% at standard dose, and 5% at twice standard dose), and the effect is offset by angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers.Thiazides may cause gout, but again the increase in serum uric acid is attenuated at low doseand opposed by angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers. w165-w167 Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers are teratogenic and should be avoided in pregnancy.A randomised trial carried out to assess the effects of blood pressure lowering drugs on sexual function confirmed the recognised effects of thiazides but showed that other classes of blood pressure lowering drug (including β blockers) did not differ from placebo.

Cost

Cost is another reason for selecting particular classes of drug but has become a minor consideration because suitable off-patent blood pressure lowering drugs in four of the five classes are available at low cost, and will be available for the fifth (angiotensin receptor blockers) later in 2009.

It is difficult to defend the widespread practice of tailoring treatment. The case for individualising blood pressure lowering therapy disappears with low dose combination therapy based on three drugs; the greater efficacy compared with selective monotherapy or dual therapy avoids the need to choose between drugs.

### Aliskiren hemifumarate and hydrochlorothiazide (Tekturna HCT) [^94fb3b11]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Tekturna HCT is indicated for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes including hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ). There are no controlled trials demonstrating risk reduction with Tekturna HCT.

Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than 1 drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program's Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC).

Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality have also been seen regularly.

Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (e.g., patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal.

Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy.

### Chlorthalidone vs hydrochlorothiazide and kidney outcomes in patients with hypertension: a secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^b49c15db]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Thiazide diuretics have been demonstrated to reduce blood pressure and the incidence of cardiovascular outcomes in those with hypertension. They are recommended as first-line agents by numerous hypertension guidelines for the general population, and in those with CKD and no proteinuria.Historically, thiazide diuretics have been avoided in patients with CKD because they had been thought to be ineffective at lowering blood pressure because thiazides were believed not to reach the distal convoluted tubule in those with CKD. Rahman et al, used ALLHAT to demonstrate that chlorthalidone reduced blood pressure to the same degree as other antihypertensive agents among those with advanced CKD (eGFR, 30-59 mL/min/1.73 m 2) and that chlorthalidone similarly reduced major adverse cardiovascular event outcomes in this population compared with other antihypertensive agents. Similar results were observed in an extended follow-up of the ALLHAT cohort averaging 8.8 years.A meta-analysisby the Blood Pressure Lowering Treatment Trialists’ Collaboration suggested similar reductions in cardiovascular outcomes in those with an eGFR less than 65 mL/min/1.73 m 2 compared with those with a greater eGFR and similar benefits regardless of class of antihypertensive agent used (including thiazides). More recently, the 2021 updated KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) guideline for the management of blood pressure in those with CKD recommended thiazide diuretics as first-line agents.The CLICK (Chlorthalidone in Chronic Kidney Disease) trial extended the evidence for chlorthalidone to those with stage 4 CKD by demonstrating an improvement in blood pressure at 12 weeks compared with placebo.However, chlorthalidone was associated with a greater reduction in eGFR and hypokalemia during the 12-week trial compared to placebo.

### Comparison of cardiovascular events among users of different classes of antihypertension medications: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^34db3183]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Importance

Antihypertension medications have been associated with prevention of cardiovascular events, although less is known about the comparative effectiveness of different medication classes.

Objective

To compare contemporary aggregated first-in-trial cardiovascular events among patients with hypertension and no substantial comorbidities.

Data Sources

The PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases were systematically searched for articles published between January 1, 1990, and October 24, 2017.

Study Selection

Randomized clinical trials that tested commonly used antihypertension medications (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, β-blockers, angiotensin receptor blockers, and diuretics) and that reported selected cardiovascular outcomes for at least 6 months of follow-up.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

The analysis was conducted from October 2017 to December 2019. Two reviewers extracted the number of cardiovascular events at the end of treatment for all study groups. For each outcome, a frequentist network meta-analysis was used to compare risk reductions between medication classes (random-effects models weighted by the inverse variance). The dose-response association between a 10-mm Hg reduction of systolic blood pressure and a 5-mm Hg reduction of diastolic blood pressure and the risk of first-in-trial cardiovascular events was estimated.

Main Outcomes and Measures

First-in-trial cardiovascular events, including cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, and revascularization.

Results

In this systematic review and network meta-analysis, data were pooled from 46 eligible clinical trials (248 887 total participants with a mean [SD] age of 65.6 [5.8] years; 52.8% men). In the network meta-analysis, compared with placebo, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, and thiazide diuretics were reported to be similarly effective in reducing overall cardiovascular events (25%), cardiovascular death (20%), and stroke (35%); angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors were reported to be the most effective in reducing the risk of myocardial infarction (28%); and diuretics were reported to be the most effective in reducing revascularization (33%). In the metaregression analyses, each 10-mm Hg reduction in systolic blood pressure and 5-mm Hg reduction in diastolic blood pressure was significantly associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular death, stroke, and overall cardiovascular events.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this network meta-analysis of clinical trials of patients with hypertension and no substantial comorbidities, different classes of antihypertension medications were associated with similar benefits in reducing cardiovascular events. Future studies should compare the effectiveness of combinations of antihypertension medications in reducing cardiovascular events.

### Antihypertensive efficacy and tolerability of two fixed-dose combinations of valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide compared with valsartan monotherapy in patients with stage 2 or 3 systolic hypertension: an 8-week, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group trial [^86b02873]. Clinical Therapeutics (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Combination therapy with at least 2 antihypertensive agents is usually needed to achieve appropriate blood pressure (BP) control in patients with isolated or predominant systolic hypertension. A currently recommended combination is a diuretic added to an angiotensin-receptor blocker.

Objective

This was a study of the effects on sitting systolic BP (SBP)of 2 combinations of valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) compared with valsartan monotherapy in patients with stage 2 or 3 systolic hypertension (SBP > or =160 mm Hg and < or =200 mm Hg) with or without other cardiovascular risk factors.

Methods

After a placebo run-in period, patients were randomized to receive double-blind treatment with either valsartan 80 mg OD(monotherapy group) or valsartan 160 mg OD (combination-therapy groups) for 4 weeks, followed by forced titration to valsartan 160 mg OD (V160), valsartan 160 mg plus HCTZ 12.5 mg OD (V160 +HCTZ12.5), or valsartan 160 mg plus HCTZ 25 mg OD (V160 +HCTZ25) for an additional 4 weeks. End points were the change in SBP between the groups receiving combination therapy and the monotherapy group, between-group changes in diastolic BP (DBP), responder rates (SBP <140 mm Hg or a reduction in SBP of > or =20 mm Hg), and tolerability.

Results

A total of 774 patients were randomized to treatment: 261 to V160, 258 to V160+HCTZ12.5, and 255 to V160 +HCTZ25. The intent-to-treat population consisted of 767 patients (411 men, 356 women; mean age, 60 years; mean weight, 84 kg; clinic mean [SD] baseline BP, 167.5 [8.1]/93.4 [9.1] mm Hg). All treatments produced significant reductions in SBP from baseline (mean [SD] reduction, 20.7 [15.7] mm Hg with V160, 27.9 [13.8] mm Hg with V160 +HCTZ12.5, and 28.3 [13.1] mm Hg with V160+HCTZ25; all, P < 0.05). DBP was reduced by 6.6 (8.9) mm Hg in the V160 group and by 10.2 (7.7) and 10.1 (7.8) mm Hg in the V160+HCTZ12.5 and V160 +HCTZ25 groups, respectively (all, P < 0.05). The additional reductions in BP with V160+HCTZ25 did not reach statistical significance compared with V160+HCTZ12.5. Responder rates were 56.9% in the V160 group, 74.4% in the V160+HCTZ12.5 group, and 75.0% in the V160 +HCTZ25 group P < 0.05, combination therapy vs monotherapy). Adverse events were reported by 27.5% of patients in the monotherapy group, compared with 28.6% and 34.0% in the groups that received V160+HCTZ12.5 and V160+HCTZ25, respectively; the differences were not significant between treatment groups.

Conclusions

Monotherapy with V160 was effective in these patients with stage 2 or 3 systolic hypertension. Significant additional reductions in SBP and DBP and an increase in responder rates were achieved with the addition to V160 of HCTZ12.5 and HCTZ25, with no significant effect on tolerability.

### Fixed-dose combination and chronic kidney disease progression: which is the best? [^1e869fb8]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Use of combination therapy whether fixed dose or separate pill combinations is becoming more prevalent. Physicians are not routinely trained in using combinations of different antihypertensive medicines.

Recent Findings

Recent outcome trials as well as smaller studies document that meaningful combinations of pharmacologically additive agents help achieve blood pressure (BP) goals faster and reduce outcomes. Clinical trials demonstrate that drugs interfering with the renin-angiotensin system, that is, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers, combined with either calcium antagonists or thiazide-like diuretics and used as first-line antihypertensive therapy in patients whose BP is more than 20/10 mmHg above goal achieve BP goal faster than sequential monotherapy. Additionally, certain combinations may provide better cardiovascular outcomes than other combinations. Lastly, combination therapy has a clear role in helping to reduce cardiovascular and renal risk, when used.

Summary

This review provides an update of current evidence regarding the associations of BP control with use of combination antihypertensive therapy to achieve BP goals. A rationale for initial single pill and fixed-dose combination therapy is reviewed. Only one trial with cardiovascular outcome has been performed using a fixed-dose combination and this revealed differences from other trials, including the greatest number of people achieving goal BP and difference in outcomes based on combination used.

### Role of diuretics in cardiovascular events and mortality in systolic blood pressure intervention trial: a post hoc analysis [^e93950ca]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

A trial with SPRINT inclusion criteria but excluding CKD, targeting intensive systolic BP control, and randomizing participates to thiazide-type diuretics versus no diuretic on top of other antihypertensive medications as needed, might tease out the beneficial effect of intensive BP control from thiazide-type diuretics. However, a small pilot trial to assess the feasibility of achieving intensive BP control without diuretics will be needed first before any such trial can be planned.

Strengths of our analysis includes the use of data from a large, randomized study that compared the effects of intensive versus standard systolic BP control, with collection of an extensive array of clinical and laboratory data at baseline and during follow-up and with adjudicated end points. The study cohort was racially diverse, and a substantial fraction of the cohort was older than 75 years, allowing generalization to these important subgroups. Despite the limitations of a postrandomization analysis, our approach determined whether the effects of the intervention on major cardiovascular events and/or all-cause mortality were attenuated by postrandomization diuretics use in regression analyses or explained by postrandomization diuretics use in mediation analyses. Thus, our study attempted to answer the question of whether the effects of the BP intervention on outcomes were independent of postrandomization diuretics use.

Our study also has several limitations. First, we cannot definitively infer that use of a thiazide-type diuretic in patients treated with an intensive systolic BP-lowering strategy would yield more favorable outcomes relative to other antihypertensive agents. Future randomized controlled trials would be required to answer that question. Second, diabetes mellitus, a disease state strongly associated with impaired natriuresis was an exclusion criterion in SPRINT. Although more than 40% of the SPRINT participants were considered to have prediabetes, these participants were shown to experience a similar benefit as participants with normoglycemia.Third, this analysis did not examine adverse events associated with thiazide-type diuretics. Finally, only 30% of the SPRINT participants had albuminuria >30 mg/g and only 6% had eGFR <30 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 at baseline; thus, we cannot make definitive conclusions for patients with more advanced or proteinuric CKD.

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Combination therapy and single-pill combinations (SPCs)—use and candidate criteria: Combination therapy is more effective, efficient, and consistent in lowering blood pressure (BP) and improves adherence when using an SPC compared with stepped-care therapy, although a stepped-care approach can be effective for BP lowering if well-executed. Initial combination therapy is recommended for stage 2 hypertension and some high-risk patients with stage 1 hypertension (eg, non-Hispanic Black adults, ASCVD risk >7.5%) using 2 agents from different classes, preferably an SPC; available randomized controlled trial (RCT) evidence supports using an RAS blocker with either a thiazide-type diuretic or a dihydropyridine CCB as initial therapy. Several small RCTs have demonstrated that low-dose combinations of 3 or 4 drugs together reduce BP more effectively than monotherapy over 3 to 6 months of treatment, although none of these trials have evaluated cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention. In general, initial combination therapy with 2 drugs is reasonable in adults with stage 2 hypertension and those at high CVD risk. For candidates for initial combination therapy—nonfrail adults with SBP ≥20 mm Hg and DBP ≥10 mm Hg from target—starting treatment with SPCs rather than equivalent free-pill combinations improves adherence; BP-lowering medications should be carefully initiated and monitored in older patients because hypotension or orthostatic hypotension (OH) may develop. In most cases, SPCs are a cost-effective alternative to multiple pill combination therapy and allow longer follow-up intervals between medication intensifications, but because SPCs are not available with every possible combination, in some cases the use of separate agents may be more or equally effective.

### Comparison of benazepril plus amlodipine or hydrochlorothiazide in high-risk patients with hypertension and coronary artery disease [^8ee0cbef]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2013). Low credibility.

Combination therapy with benazepril 40 mg and amlodipine 10 mg (B+A) has been shown to be more effective than benazepril 40 mg and hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) 25 mg (B+H) in reducing cardiovascular (CV) events in high-risk patients with stage 2 hypertension with similar blood pressure reductions. In the present post hoc analysis, we evaluated whether B+A is more effective than B+H for reducing CV events in patients with known coronary artery disease (CAD) at baseline in a subgroup analysis of the Avoiding Cardiovascular events through COMbination therapy in Patients LIving with Systolic Hypertension (ACCOMPLISH) study. The main trial randomized 11,506 patients. Of those, 5,744 received B+A and 5,762 received B+H. Of the 11,506 patients, 5,314 (46%) were classified as having CAD at baseline. The mean patient follow-up period was 35.7 months for the B+A group and 35.6 months for the B+H group. The primary end point was the interval to the first event of composite CV morbidity and mortality. At baseline, significant differences were present between the 5,314 with CAD and the 6,192 without CAD. The patients with CAD had a lower systolic blood pressure and heart rate, a lower incidence of diabetes, and greater incidence of dyslipidemia. However, no baseline differences were found between the randomized B+A and B+H groups. In the patients with CAD, an 18% reduction occurred in the hazard ratio for CV events (primary end point) with B+A versus B+H (p = 0.0016). In a prespecified secondary analysis of the composite end point, including only CV death, myocardial infarction, and stroke, the hazard ratio in the patients with CAD was reduced by 25% (p = 0.0033) in the B+A group compared with the B+H group. B+A was more effective than B+H at comparable blood pressure reductions for reducing CV events in patients, regardless of the presence of CAD. In conclusion, our findings suggest that the combination of B+A should be preferentially used for older patients with high-risk, stage 2 hypertension.

### Thiazides in the management of hypertension in older adults-a systematic review [^0da28e29]. BMC Geriatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

Our systematic review investigated the benefits and risks of treatment with thiazides for the management of hypertension in older people. This systematic review was one of a series of systematic reviews on commonly used drugs in older people and aimed to identify evidence to develop recommendations relating to inappropriate use and discontinuation of these medications in older adults. Overall, the evidence suggests a benefit of thiazide treatment for the management of hypertension in older people for clinically relevant outcomes such as cardiovascular mortality and morbidity, especially stroke.

These results are in the line with the results seen in younger populations, where thiazides appear to reduce mortality, stroke, cardiovascular events and coronary heart disease. Except for a reduction of mortality which was less clear in our age group, we found similar results. Despite the fact that thiazides are among the drugs that often cause hospitalisation, this outcome was not found in the present study. We found an increased risk for gout but mixed results for other adverse events. Frequent adverse events of thiazides include electrolyte imbalances, but our systematic review focused on clinical outcomes and we did not include studies reporting about abnormal laboratory measurements.

Based on the evidence identified, three recommendations on potential discontinuation or lowering of the dose of thiazides were developed. Although some evidence for risks of thiazide treatment was also identified, the research team considered that a general recommendation for the discontinuation of thiazide treatment in older adults would be inappropriate.

Despite the currently ongoing discussion that chlorthalidone may be superior to hydrochlorothiazide in preventing cardiovascular events we found no convincing evidence that a certain thiazide may be more beneficial in the treatment of hypertension. Some studies suggest that chlorthalidone shows more benefit compared to hydrochlorothiazide. In contrast, we included a retrospective cohort study showing no significant difference regarding the efficacy of both drugs, but in this study chlorthalidone was associated with more adverse events in older patients. This effect, though, was mainly present for high doses of chlorthalidone.

### Blood pressure-lowering efficacy of loop diuretics for primary hypertension [^2817c700]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Antihypertensive drugs from the thiazide diuretic drug class have been shown to reduce mortality and cardiovascular morbidity. Loop diuretics are indicated and used to treat hypertension, but a systematic review of their blood pressure-lowering efficacy or effectiveness in terms of reducing cardiovascular mortality or morbidity from randomized controlled trial (RCT) evidence has not been conducted.

Objectives

To determine the dose-related decrease in systolic or diastolic blood pressure, or both, as well as adverse events leading to participant withdrawal and adverse biochemical effects (serum potassium, uric acid, creatinine, glucose and lipids profile) due to loop diuretics versus placebo control in the treatment of people with primary hypertension.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Hypertension Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, 2014, Issue 9), MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process, EMBASE, and ClinicalTrials.gov to 27 October 2014.

Selection Criteria

We included double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trials of at least three weeks duration comparing loop diuretic with a placebo in people with primary hypertension defined as blood pressure greater than 140/90 mmHg at baseline.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed the risk of bias and extracted data. We used weighted mean difference and a fixed effects model to combine continuous outcome data. We analysed the drop outs due to adverse effects using relative risk ratio.

Main Results

Nine trials evaluated the dose-related blood pressure-lowering efficacy of five drugs within the loop diuretics class (furosemide 40 mg to 60 mg, cicletanine 100 mg to 150 mg, piretanide 3 mg to 6 mg, indacrinone enantiomer -2.5 mg to -10.0/+80 mg, and etozolin 200 mg) in 460 people with baseline blood pressure of 162/103 mmHg for a mean duration of 8.8 weeks. The best estimate of systolic/diastolic blood pressure-lowering efficacy of loop diuretics was -7.9 (-10.4 to -5.4) mmHg/ -4.4 (-5.9 to -2.8) mmHg. Withdrawals due to adverse effects and serum biochemical changes did not show a significant difference.We performed additional searches in 2012 and 2014, which found no additional trials meeting the minimum inclusion criteria.

Authors' Conclusions

Based on the limited number of published RCTs, the systolic/diastolic blood pressure-lowering effect of loop diuretics is -8/-4 mmHg, which is likely an overestimate. We graded the quality of evidence for both systolic and diastolic blood pressure estimates as "low" due to the high risk of bias of included studies and the high likelihood of publication bias. We found no clinically meaningful blood pressure-lowering differences between different drugs within the loop diuretic class. The dose-ranging effects of loop diuretics could not be evaluated. The review did not provide a good estimate of the incidence of harms associated with loop diuretics because of the short duration of the trials and the lack of reporting of adverse effects in many of the trials.

### Efficacy and tolerability of combination therapy with valsartan plus hydrochlorothiazide compared with amlodipine monotherapy in hypertensive patients with other cardiovascular risk factors: the VAST study [^583b4fa9]. Clinical Therapeutics (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Recent antihypertensive treatment guidelines recommend greater use of combination therapies.

Objectives

The primary objective of this study was to determine whether combination therapy with valsartan 160 mg plus hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) 25 mg OD would be more effective than monotherapy with amlodipine 10 mg OD in reducing systolic blood pressure (SBP) in patients with moderate (stage II) hypertension and > or =1 other cardiovascular risk factor or concomitant condition. A secondary objective was to assess the effects of the study treatments on circulating markers of endothelial dysfunction and vascular inflammation.

Methods

This was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, 24-week study. After a 2-week, single-blind, placebo run-in period, patients were randomized to 3 groups, 2 of them receiving valsartan 160 mg OD and 1 receiving amlodipine 5 mg OD. At week 4, HCTZ 12.5 mg OD was added to valsartan in one of the treatment groups (V+HCTZ12.5), HCTZ 25 mg OD was added to the other (V+HCTZ25), and the amlodipine dose was force-titrated to 10 mg OD (A10). The primary efficacy variable was change in mean sitting SBP at week 24. Other variables were changes in mean sitting diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and mean pulse pressure (PP) from baseline, and response rate (systolic response defined as mean sitting SBP <140 mm Hg or a reduction in mean sitting SBP of > or =20 mm Hg from baseline; diastolic response defined as mean sitting DBP <90 mm Hg or a reduction in mean sitting DBP of > or =10 mm Hg from baseline). Changes in the following markers of endothelial dysfunction were determined at baseline and weeks 4, 12, and 24 in all randomized patients from the participating European and South African centers: high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), vascular tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) antigen, and oxidized low-density lipoprotein (LDL).

Results

The study enrolled 1088 patients with moderate hypertension (mean age, 61 years; 82% white; 53% women). The intent-to-treat population consisted of 1079 patients: 357 in the V+HCTZ12.5 group, 363 in the V+HCTZ25 group, and 359 in the A10 group. At baseline, the groups were comparable in terms of blood pressure and most other characteristics; the only statistically significant difference between groups was in the proportion of patients aged > or =65 years, which was lower in the amlodipine group (P = 0.01). At the end of the study, the least squares mean (SD) changes from baseline in mean sitting SBP were 27.1 (13.7), 29.7 (13.7), and 27.6 (13.8) mm Hg in the V+HCTZ12.5, V+HCTZ25, and A10 groups, respectively, with corresponding percent changes of 16%, 18%, and 17% (P < 0.05, V+HCTZ25 vs A10). The changes in mean sitting DBP did not differ significantly between groups. The reductions in PP were 17.5 (11.3), 18.7 (11.3), and 16.9 (11.3) mm Hg, with percent changes of 24%, 26%, and 23% (P < 0.05, V+HCTZ25 vs A10). Significant reductions in t-PA antigen were observed in both combination-therapy groups compared with the amlodipine monotherapy group at week 12 (P < 0.05); the reductions remained significant through the end of the study in the V+HCTZ12.5 group. There was a significant reduction in IL-6 and hs-CRP at week 12 with V+HCTZ25 compared with A10 (P < 0.05). Oxidized LDL values were reduced by approximately 10% with all treatments. Rates of total adverse events were significantly lower with the valsartan-based treatments compared with amlodipine monotherapy (49.7%, 49.6%, and 67.5% with V+HCTZ12.5, V+HCTZ25, and A10, respectively; P < 0.05). Rates of total discontinuations were a respective 10.1%, 9.0%, and 24.5%, and discontinuation rates due to AEs were 4.2%, 3.5%, and 18.2%. Leg edema was more common with amlodipine monotherapy than with the valsartan-based combinations (P < 0.05).

Conclusion

In this group of patients with moderate hypertension and > or =1 other cardiovascular risk factor or concomitant condition, similar and greater antihypertensive effects were seen with the fixed-dose combinations of valsartan 160 mg and HCTZ 12.5 and 25 mg OD, respectively, compared with amlodipine 10 mg OD, with significantly lower rates of treatment-related adverse events and possible beneficial effects on vascular markers.

### Comparative effectiveness of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors versus β-blockers as second-line therapy for hypertension [^4431778f]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Trials comparing hypertension monotherapies have found either no difference or modest differences in blood pressure (BP) and cardiovascular events. However, no trial has assessed the comparative effectiveness of 2nd-line therapy in patients whose BP was not controlled with a thiazide diuretic.

Methods and Results

This was an observational study conducted with a hypertension registry of adults enrolled in 3 large integrated health care delivery systems from 2002 to 2007. Patients newly started on thiazide monotherapy whose BP remained uncontrolled were observed after addition of either an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or β-blocker for subsequent BP control and cardiovascular events. Patients for whom either add-on drug was indicated or contraindicated were excluded. After adjustment for patient characteristics and study year, BP control during the subsequent 6 to 18 months was comparable for the 2 agents (70.5% ACE, 69.0% β-blockers; P=0.09). Rates of incident myocardial infarction (hazard ratio, 1.05; 95% confidence interval, 0.69 to 1.58) and stroke (hazard ratio, 1.01; 95% confidence interval, 0.68 to 1.52) were also similar for the ACE inhibitor and β-blocker groups during an average of 2.3 years of follow-up. There were also no differences in heart failure or renal function.

Conclusions

ACE inhibitors and β-blockers are equally effective in lowering BP and preventing cardiovascular events for patients whose BP is not controlled with a thiazide diuretic alone and who have no compelling indication for a specific 2nd-line agent.

### Searching for optimal blood pressure targets in type 2 diabetic patients with coronary artery disease [^9d1ccb25]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2019). Medium credibility.

Diuretics

Despite some concern about the increased risk for metabolic and electrolytic disturbance, diuretics are effective for the treatment of hypertension in type 2 diabetic patients. In post hoc analyses of patients with hypertension and T2DM, thiazide resulted in a significant reduction in cardiovascular events, all-cause mortality, and hospitalization for heart failure compared to placebo, and generally was shown to be non-inferior to other antihypertensive agents. Benefits attributed to thiazide diuretics in terms of cardiovascular event reduction outweigh the risk of worsening glucose control in type 2 diabetic patients. Low dose thiazides in combination with ACEI/ARB may minimize or prevent some of metabolic and electrolytic disturbance associated with diuretic therapy. Thiazide-like diuretics chlortalidone and indapamide were found to be less markedly associated metabolic abnormalities than hydrochlorothiazide but were as good as amlodipine or lisinopril in preventing fatal or non-fatal coronary artery disease and was more effective in hypertensive patients with T2DM. However, the risk of worsening glucose control in type 2 diabetes and of new-onset diabetes in non-diabetic patients correlate with thiazide treatment due to its potential to negatively influence insulin resistance. Thus, glucose and electrolytes should be monitored when initiating therapy.

β-adrenergic blockers

Hypertension is underpinned by high sympathetic nerve activity especially in younger or middle-age subjects. β-blockers reduce heart rate, decrease catecholamine-induced inflammatory reaction, and improve endothelial shear stress,which exert a beneficial effect on coronary blood flow and clinical outcomes. β-blockers are frequently used as add-on treatment in hypertensive patients with coronary artery disease, heart failure or atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. Caution should be made when they were used in patients with T2DM due to its potential adverse metabolic effects, including an increase in triglyceride levels, a decrease in HDL cholesterol levels, weight gain, masking the worsening symptoms of hypoglycemia and aggravating insulin resistance. Cavedilol with combined non-selective β and ɑ1 adrenergic antagonist actions improves survival in patients with heart failure and could not be as deleterious for glucose control.

New hypoglycemic agents

The role of certain new anti-diabetic medications including dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, glucagon like peptide 1 (GLP-1)agonists, and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT 2) inhibitors, in BP control besides their glucose lowering effects in diabetic individuals has been investigated.

Blood pressure treatment intensity—effects on kidney outcomes and adverse events—is summarized as follows: “Several meta-analyses and systematic reviews support more intensive BP treatment to reduce cardiovascular events but do not demonstrate a reduction in the rate of progression of kidney disease.” Intensive treatment “may result in a modest reduction in glomerular filtration rate … and may be reversible,” and “Electrolyte abnormalities are also more likely during intensive BP treatment.”

### Diuretic treatment of hypertension [^5752ed60]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

THE PRO SIDE

Lowering blood pressure (BP) has been shown to reduce the risk of cardiovascular (CV) morbidity and mortality. The main benefit of lowering BP is due to the reduction in the risk of stroke and heart failure (HF). In many trials in which a reduction in CV events was documented, antihypertensive therapy was diuretic-based (–).

Effect of diuretic treatment on stroke morbidity and mortality

In the era of placebo-controlled trials, several studies attested to the efficacy of diuretics in reducing stroke morbidity and mortality. In a recent published study from China, indapamide given to patients with a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack reduced the risk of stroke by 31%. In the Perindopril Protection Against Recurrent Stroke Study (PROGRESS) in patients with cerebrovascular disease, combination therapy of a diuretic (indapamide) and ACE inhibitor (perindopril) reduced the risk of stroke by 43% compared with placebo. Perindopril alone, despite lowering systolic BP by 5 mmHg, decreased stroke risk only by a nonsignificant 5%.

Several studies attested to the superior efficacy of diuretic therapy over other antihypertensive agents in reducing the risk for stroke (–,,,). In the Second Australian National Blood Pressure Study (ANBP2), fatal stroke occurred two times more in patients treated with an ACE inhibitor than in patients treated with a diuretic. In the Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT), chlorthalidone was superior to the α-blocker doxazosin mesylate in the prevention of stroke and was superior to the ACE inhibitor lisinopril in the prevention of stroke in black individuals. In the Medical Research Council (MRC) study in 1985, bendrofluazide was documented to be almost three times as efficacious as the β-blocker propranolol hydrochloride in preventing stroke. In the MRC trial in elderly patients, hydrochlorothiazide and amiloride reduced the risk of stroke, whereas β-blockers failed to reduce the risk of stroke despite a similar lowering of BP. In the International Nifedipine GITS Study: Intervention as a Goal in Hypertension Treatment (INSIGHT), 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide plus amiloride 2.5 were as effective as 30 mg nifedipine for preventing stroke.

### Standards of medical care in diabetes – 2009 [^c2ee1e82]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Lowering of blood pressure with regimens based on a variety of antihypertensive drugs, including ACE inhibitors, ARBs, β-blockers, diuretics, and calcium channel blockers, has been shown to be effective in reducing cardiovascular events. Several studies have suggested that ACE inhibitors may be superior to dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers in reducing cardiovascular events (–). However, a variety of other studies have shown no specific advantage to ACE inhibitors as initial treatment of hypertension in the general hypertensive population, but rather an advantage on cardiovascular outcomes of initial therapy with low-dose thiazide diuretics.

In people with diabetes, inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) may have unique advantages for initial or early therapy of hypertension. In a nonhypertension trial of high-risk individuals, including a large subset with diabetes, an ACE inhibitor reduced CVD outcomes. In patients with congestive heart failure (CHF), including diabetic subgroups, ARBs have been shown to reduce major CVD outcomes (–), and in type 2 patients with significant nephropathy, ARBs were superior to calcium channel blockers for reducing heart failure (–). Though evidence for distinct advantages of RAS inhibitors on CVD outcomes in diabetes remains conflicting, the high CVD risks associated with diabetes, and the high prevalence of undiagnosed CVD, may still favor recommendations for their use as first-line hypertension therapy in people with diabetes. Recently, the blood pressure arm of the ADVANCE trial demonstrated that routine administration of a fixed combination of the ACE inhibitor perindopril and the diuretic indapamide significantly reduced combined microvascular and macrovascular outcomes, as well as CVD and total mortality. The improved outcomes could also have been due to lower achieved blood pressure in the perindopril-indapamide arm. The compelling benefits of RAS inhibitors in diabetic patients with albuminuria or renal insufficiency provide additional rationale for use of these agents (see section VI.B below).

Chronic coronary disease (CCD) with hypertension—blood pressure targets and medication choices include that reducing SBP to <130 mm Hg can lower cardiovascular risk and mortality, and when SBP is <130 mm Hg, a DBP between 70 and 80 mm Hg is associated with reduced cardiovascular events without increased serious adverse events; ACE inhibitors (ACEi), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB), and beta blockers (BB) have been shown to reduce cardiovascular disease (CVD) events and all-cause death, although conflicting evidence exists regarding long-term BB therapy (>1 year) in CCD with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction, and if additional antihypertensive medications are needed, calcium channel blockers (CCB), thiazide-type diuretics, and/or mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRA) are recommended.
