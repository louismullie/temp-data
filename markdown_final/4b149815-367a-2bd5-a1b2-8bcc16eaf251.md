## Question

Metronidazole for diarrhea

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about when and how to use metronidazole for diarrhea, including dosing, indications, and how guidelines have evolved. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and whether the diarrhea is likely infectious and, if so, which pathogens are plausible. Then, I should verify the specific scenarios where metronidazole is indicated, especially Clostridioides difficile infection versus parasitic etiologies. Next, I will review dosing, duration, and formulation nuances, including IV use in fulminant disease. After that, I need to check how guidelines have shifted away from metronidazole as first-line therapy for CDI and why. Finally, I will consider special populations, safety, and a practical decision framework, making sure I reconcile any conflicting data before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame: most acute diarrheas are self-limited and viral, so routine antibiotics are not indicated, and empiric metronidazole is inappropriate unless there is a compatible pathogen and clinical context, such as recent antibiotic exposure raising concern for C. difficile or travel-related risks for protozoa like Giardia or Entamoeba histolytica [^1d0e0542] [^2fd5819a].

> I will now examine the primary indication where metronidazole remains relevant: Clostridioides difficile infection. Historically, metronidazole 500 mg orally three times daily for 10–14 days was standard for mild-to-moderate CDI, but wait, let me verify the current stance because guidelines have shifted markedly since 2017 [^a1aa2f21] [^5b080279]. Contemporary IDSA/SHEA and ACG guidelines recommend oral vancomycin or fidaxomicin as first-line for initial CDI of any severity, reserving metronidazole only when vancomycin and fidaxomicin are unavailable or contraindicated, due to inferior cure rates and concerns about neurotoxicity with repeated courses [^b0ae6c74] [^6be5096c] [^71bfd261]. I should double-check the magnitude of difference: pooled RCT data show vancomycin achieves about 79% clinical cure versus 72% with metronidazole, with an even larger gap in severe disease, which aligns with the guideline downgrade of metronidazole [^86aeccbe] [^6a6675be].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about abandoning metronidazole entirely. In fulminant or severe-complicated CDI with ileus, combination therapy with IV metronidazole plus oral or rectal vancomycin is recommended to ensure colonic drug exposure when oral therapy alone may be inadequate, so metronidazole still has a role as adjunctive therapy in that specific scenario [^150d858c] [^6be5096c]. I need to ensure I note that IV metronidazole alone is insufficient for colonic CDI because it does not deliver adequate intraluminal concentrations, which is why it must be paired with vancomycin in severe disease with ileus [^150d858c].

> Next, I should review parasitic indications where metronidazole remains appropriate. For giardiasis, metronidazole is an alternative to tinidazole, typically 250–500 mg orally three times daily for 5–10 days, with tinidazole preferred for adherence and tolerability when available [^3d7d2d73] [^123f35d2]. For amebic colitis, metronidazole or tinidazole is first-line, followed by a luminal agent such as paromomycin to eradicate cysts, and I should confirm that this sequence is standard to prevent relapse [^2fd5819a]. For Dientamoeba fragilis, metronidazole is a treatment option, though evidence quality is limited and its pathogenicity remains debated, so I should caution that data are weak and decisions should be individualized [^5084014f] [^1a9e4b87].

> Let me consider dosing and duration carefully. For CDI, when metronidazole is used off-label, 500 mg orally three times daily for 10–14 days is the conventional regimen, and I should emphasize limiting use to a single course when possible due to neurotoxicity risk with repeated exposure [^a1aa2f21] [^5b080279] [^d4ae9240]. For giardiasis, 250–500 mg three times daily for 5–10 days is typical, with some regimens extending to 7–10 days in refractory cases, though tinidazole single-dose therapy is often preferred for adherence and tolerability [^123f35d2] [^3d7d2d73]. I should confirm that pediatric dosing differs and that metronidazole lacks a commercial pediatric suspension in the U.S., complicating pediatric use, which is why vancomycin or fidaxomicin are increasingly favored in children when available [^3d7d2d73] [^486a0aee].

> I need to check safety and monitoring. Metronidazole can cause dose- and duration-related neurotoxicity, including peripheral neuropathy and encephalopathy, so prolonged or repeated courses should be avoided; patients should also be counseled to avoid alcohol during therapy and for at least 48 hours after completion due to disulfiram-like reactions, and clinicians should monitor for gastrointestinal intolerance and hematologic effects with extended therapy [^d4ae9240] [^cfe9902a]. But wait, what if the patient is pregnant? Metronidazole is generally considered acceptable in pregnancy when clinically indicated, including for CDI or protozoal infections, though shared decision-making is prudent and vancomycin may be preferred for CDI when available [^f1eeb183].

> Next, I should review special populations and contexts. In inflammatory bowel disease, metronidazole is not recommended for CDI because of higher failure rates; vancomycin or fidaxomicin should be used instead, and IBD flares should be tested for C. difficile given the high prevalence and worse outcomes when CDI is present [^a3e0d695] [^16c2308d]. In children, metronidazole remains an option for nonsevere CDI, but emerging pediatric data and FDA approval of fidaxomicin down to 6 months have shifted practice toward vancomycin or fidaxomicin when accessible, with metronidazole reserved for access or tolerance issues [^193ebd2d] [^486a0aee]. In travelers with persistent diarrhea, I should remember to test for C. difficile, especially after antibiotic exposure, and treat according to severity using vancomycin or fidaxomicin preferentially, with metronidazole as a less optimal alternative if needed [^57054794] [^9b3d3cf6].

> Hold on, I should verify the mechanistic rationale for metronidazole's declining role in CDI. Metronidazole is systemically absorbed and achieves only modest colonic luminal concentrations, which may explain slower clinical response and inferior outcomes compared with vancomycin, which remains intraluminal and concentrates at the site of infection; this pharmacokinetic limitation underpins the guideline shift even though in vitro resistance to metronidazole in C. difficile remains uncommon [^99735560] [^6db243da]. I should also note that while some studies suggest plasmid-mediated resistance genes, clinical failure often occurs despite susceptible MICs, reinforcing that PK and clinical severity are key drivers of response rather than classic resistance alone [^164f3c7d].

> Let me synthesize a practical decision framework. First, confirm the diarrhea phenotype and risk factors: recent antibiotics, healthcare exposure, age, immunocompromise, and IBD increase the pretest probability of CDI, while travel, untreated water, or daycare exposure raise concern for protozoa; test accordingly with NAAT or a two-step algorithm for CDI and targeted ova-and-parasite testing when indicated [^b0ae6c74] [^2fd5819a]. If CDI is confirmed or strongly suspected, prioritize vancomycin or fidaxomicin for initial therapy; reserve metronidazole for nonsevere cases when first-line agents are unavailable or contraindicated, and use metronidazole 500 mg orally three times daily for 10–14 days as a single course when chosen, escalating to combination therapy with IV metronidazole plus oral/rectal vancomycin if severe-complicated disease or ileus is present [^b0ae6c74] [^150d858c]. If giardiasis or amebiasis is diagnosed, use metronidazole or tinidazole with appropriate follow-up and cyst eradication for Entamoeba, and consider tinidazole when available for improved adherence [^3d7d2d73] [^2fd5819a]. Throughout, avoid empiric metronidazole for undifferentiated infectious diarrhea and reassess if there is no improvement within 48–72 hours to avoid delays in appropriate therapy [^1d0e0542].

> In conclusion, metronidazole retains a limited but important role in diarrhea management: it is no longer first-line for CDI due to inferior efficacy, but remains appropriate for protozoal infections such as giardiasis and amebiasis, and serves as adjunctive IV therapy in fulminant CDI with ileus; when used for CDI, it should be dosed at 500 mg orally three times daily for 10–14 days as a single course, with careful attention to safety, stewardship, and guideline-concordant alternatives whenever possible [^b0ae6c74] [^6be5096c] [^a1aa2f21] [^5b080279].

Metronidazole is **not first-line** for most diarrheas [^b0ae6c74] and is reserved for specific infections such as Clostridioides difficile [^a71cefff], Giardia [^3d7d2d73], and Entamoeba histolytica [^2fd5819a]. For C. difficile, use **500 mg PO TID for 10–14 days** [^a1aa2f21] only if vancomycin or fidaxomicin are unavailable or contraindicated, as metronidazole is less effective [^86aeccbe] and is not recommended for severe disease [^6be5096c]. For Giardia or amebiasis, use **500 mg PO TID for 5–10 days** [^123f35d2]. Metronidazole is ineffective for viral or most bacterial diarrheas [^1d0e0542] and should not be used empirically; avoid in pregnancy if possible and monitor for neurotoxicity with prolonged use [^d4ae9240].

## Indications for metronidazole in diarrhea

Metronidazole is indicated for diarrhea caused by specific pathogens:

| **Pathogen** | **Indication** | **Recommended dosage** |
|-|-|-|
| Clostridioides difficile | Alternative therapy when vancomycin or fidaxomicin are unavailable or contraindicated | 500 mg PO TID for 10–14 days [^a1aa2f21] [^a71cefff] |
| Giardia lamblia | First-line therapy | 500 mg PO TID for 5–10 days [^123f35d2] |
| Entamoeba histolytica | First-line therapy | 500 mg PO TID for 5–10 days [^2fd5819a] |

---

Metronidazole is **not effective** for viral diarrhea or most bacterial diarrheas (e.g. Salmonella, Campylobacter, Shigella, E. coli) [^1d0e0542] and should not be used empirically [^4f43ffef].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines emphasize the following:

- **Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI)**: Metronidazole is no longer recommended as first-line therapy for CDI [^b0ae6c74] due to lower efficacy compared to vancomycin and fidaxomicin [^86aeccbe]. It is reserved for cases where vancomycin or fidaxomicin are unavailable or contraindicated [^a71cefff].

- **Giardiasis and amebiasis**: Metronidazole remains a first-line treatment for these parasitic infections [^3d7d2d73] [^2fd5819a].

- **Empiric use**: Metronidazole should not be used empirically for undifferentiated diarrhea [^1d0e0542] without confirmed infection [^4f43ffef].

---

## Efficacy of metronidazole in treating diarrhea

The efficacy of metronidazole varies by pathogen:

- **Clostridioides difficile**: Clinical cure rates with metronidazole are approximately 72–84% [^86aeccbe], lower than vancomycin (79–97%) [^c78f4879] and fidaxomicin (88–92%) [^notfound]. Metronidazole is less effective in severe CDI [^6be5096c] and is associated with higher recurrence rates [^6a6675be].

- **Giardiasis and amebiasis**: Metronidazole is highly effective (> 90% cure rates) [^notfound] for these parasitic infections [^notfound].

---

## Safety profile and adverse effects

Metronidazole is generally well-tolerated, but adverse effects include:

- **Common adverse effects**: Nausea, metallic taste, headache, dizziness, gastrointestinal upset [^cfe9902a].

- **Serious adverse effects**: Neurotoxicity (peripheral neuropathy, encephalopathy), hepatotoxicity, and hematologic abnormalities [^d4ae9240].

- **Pregnancy**: Metronidazole should be used cautiously in pregnancy, particularly in the first trimester, and only if clearly indicated [^notfound].

---

## Comparison with alternative treatments

| **Pathogen** | **Metronidazole** | **Vancomycin** | **Fidaxomicin** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Clostridioides difficile | Less effective; alternative therapy | Highly effective; first-line | Highly effective; first-line |
| Giardia lamblia | Highly effective; first-line | Not applicable | Not applicable |
| Entamoeba histolytica | Highly effective; first-line | Not applicable | Not applicable |

---

Vancomycin and fidaxomicin are **superior to metronidazole** for CDI [^86aeccbe], whereas metronidazole remains first-line for giardiasis and amebiasis [^3d7d2d73] [^2fd5819a].

---

## Special considerations

- **Pediatric patients**: Metronidazole is an alternative therapy for pediatric CDI [^193ebd2d], but vancomycin or fidaxomicin are preferred when available [^notfound].

- **Immunocompromised patients**: Metronidazole may be less effective in immunocompromised individuals, and alternative therapies should be considered [^notfound].

- **Drug interactions**: Metronidazole interacts with warfarin, lithium, and alcohol, necessitating careful monitoring and patient counseling [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Metronidazole is **not first-line** for most diarrheas and is reserved for specific infections such as C. difficile (when vancomycin or fidaxomicin are unavailable) [^a71cefff], Giardia, and Entamoeba histolytica [^2fd5819a]. It is ineffective for viral and most bacterial diarrheas and should not be used empirically [^1d0e0542]. Clinicians should follow current guidelines, consider pathogen-specific indications, and monitor for adverse effects, particularly with prolonged use [^d4ae9240].

### The role of antibiotics in the treatment of infectious diarrhea [^1d0e0542]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

Infectious diarrhea is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality and a common complaint in clinical practice. Routine empirical use of antibiotics for infectious diarrhea should be avoided because of the self-limited nature of most cases, the cost of antibiotics, and the potential to worsen the already significant problem of antibiotic resistance of enteric pathogens. For patients with severe invasive or prolonged diarrhea or who are at high risk of complications, such as the elderly, diabetics, cirrhotics, and immunocompromised patients, empirical treatment with a quinolone antibiotic for 3 to 5 days can be considered. Antibiotic treatment can be highly effective for Shigella, ETEC, and V. cholerae infections, and metronidazole is indicated for C. difficile colitis. The impact of antibiotics for other specific pathogens is modest, and antibiotic therapy should be reserved for the same group of patients who would be considered for empirical treatment. The most significant problem in the antibiotic treatment of infectious diarrhea is the progressive increase in resistance among enteric pathogens; only the prudent use of antimicrobials in all areas of daily practice can limit or delay the impact of this serious problem.

### Treatment of Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea [^acfc1ce4]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the literature related to the treatment and infection control of Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD).

Data Sources

A MEDLINE search (1966-August 2001) of the English literature was conducted.

Data Synthesis

C. difficile is a leading cause of antibiotic-related diarrhea. The clinical spectrum extends from simple diarrhea to fulminant colitis. Cessation of antibiotic therapy alone is sufficient for mild cases; however, the majority of cases require oral metronidazole as the drug of choice. Vancomycin orally is reserved for patients who have failed to respond to metronidazole, are pregnant, or are severely ill. There is an important role for infection control interventions.

Conclusions

CDAD is a common infection. Appropriate antibiotic treatment and infection control policies can prevent the spread and reduce the morbidity associated with this disease.

### Prospective, randomized inpatient study of oral metronidazole versus oral metronidazole and rifampin for treatment of primary episode of Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea [^bffc8759]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Background

To date, no randomized trial to address the use of adjunctive rifampin in addition to metronidazole for the treatment of Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea has been reported. Rifampin has excellent in vitro activity against C. difficile and penetrates into cellular materials where the organisms may persist.

Methods

This was a prospective, randomized, single-blinded study of 39 patients that compared therapy with metronidazole alone versus therapy with metronidazole and rifampin for 10 days to treat laboratory-confirmed primary episode C. difficile-associated diarrhea. Twenty patients were randomly assigned to the metronidazole group, and 19 were randomly assigned to the metronidazole and rifampin group. Data were analyzed by intention-to-treat analysis using the 2-tailed Kaplan-Meier method and the log-rank test.

Results

Adjunctive rifampin treatment for 10 days, compared with treatment with metronidazole alone for 10 days, was associated with a similar median time to symptom improvement (9.0 days vs. 6.5 days; P = 0.74), a similar median time to first relapse (26 days vs. 16 days; P = 0.23), a similar proportion of patients with relapse by study day 40 (42% vs. 38%; P = 1.0), and a similar proportion of patients experiencing nonfatal adverse events (37% vs. 40%; P = 0.55). There were a significantly higher number of deaths in the metronidazole and rifampin group, compared with the metronidazole group (6 of 19 patients vs. 1 of 20 patients; P = 0.04), but there were fewer laboratory-confirmed relapses by study day 40 (2 vs. 4; P = 0.66).

Conclusions

We conclude that there is no role for routine rifampin as an adjunct to treatment with metronidazole for hospitalized patients with C. difficile-associated diarrhea. The cure rates for both treatment groups remain unacceptably low, and better treatments are urgently needed.

### Defining the black box: a narrative review of factors associated with adverse outcomes from severeinfection [^ca13e962]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Treatment factors and CDI outcomes

A full discussion of the treatment of severe CDI is beyond the scope of this review. However, we will discuss two specific treatment modalities owing to their complicated relationship specifically with severe CDI. Although not discussed here, tantamount to any antimicrobial therapy or surgical intervention is excellent supportive care. As Vely states in their discussion of the role of surgery in the treatment of CDI: 'Resuscitation to euvolemia, early aggressive treatment with the appropriate antibiotics, and early surgical intervention are pivotal factors for better outcomes'.

Metronidazole

Metronidazole has had a shifting role in the management of CDI in recent years. Previously the standard first line therapy for mild to moderate CDI, it has now taken a backseat to other therapies. In the management of severe CDI in particular, metronidazole is not recommended as primary therapy because it has been associated with higher rates of treatment failure. A recent retrospective study of patients with severe CDI in Singapore found that in 2012 83.9% of patients with severe CDI (by 2010 IDSA/SHEA criteria) and 77.3% of those with severe CDI received treatment with metronidazole monotherapy. This same study also saw more persistent diarrhea, major complications and deaths with increased severity of CDI, where the majority of the severe CDI was treated with metronidazole.

That is not, however, to say that there is no role for metronidazole in the treatment of severe CDI. A 2014 study found that for patients who were critically ill with severe CDI there was higher mortality in those that received monotherapy with PO vancomycin compared to combination therapy with metronidazole. There is, of course, conflicting data with a 2018 study showing higher 30-day mortality in the combination therapy group compared to the monotherapy, although this finding did not reach statistical significance.

Overall, the role of metronidazole in the management of severe CDI, as it relates to outcomes, has yet to be fully established; while monotherapy with metronidazole is associated with worse outcomes further studies are needed to further delineate its role as an adjunctive therapy.

### A comparison of vancomycin and metronidazole for the treatment of Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea, stratified by disease severity [^c78f4879]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

The study Vancomycin vs. metronidazole for C. difficile colitis was published by Zar FA and colleagues in 2007 in the journal Clin Infect Dis. This study is related to the following diseases: Clostridioides difficile infection. In the Vancomycin vs. metronidazole for C. difficile colitis study, the trial question was: what is the effect of vancomycin in patients with C. difficile-associated diarrhea? In the Vancomycin vs. metronidazole for C. difficile colitis study, the study design was: single center, double blinded, RCT. In the Vancomycin vs. metronidazole for C. difficile colitis study, the population was: 150 patients (68 female, 82 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with C. difficile-associated diarrhea were stratified according to whether they had mild or severe disease based on clinical criteria. The key exclusion criteria were perforated viscus or bowel obstruction; prior failure of C. difficile-associated diarrhea to respond to either study drug; pregnancy; history of allergy to either study drug; or treatment with oral vancomycin or parenteral or oral metronidazole during the previous 14 days. In the Vancomycin vs. metronidazole for C. difficile colitis study, the interventions were: n = 71 vancomycin (125 mg QID PO for 10 days) n = 79 metronidazole (250 mg QID PO for 10 days). In the Vancomycin vs. metronidazole for C. difficile colitis study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in cure rate (97% vs. 84%; RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.33 to 1.97). In the Vancomycin vs. metronidazole for C. difficile colitis study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in cure in patients with mild disease (98% vs. 90%; RR 1.09, 95% CI -1.22 to 3.4) Significant increase in cure in patients with severe disease (97% vs. 76%; RR 1.28, 95% CI 0.2 to 2.36). In the Vancomycin vs. metronidazole for C. difficile colitis study, the conclusion was: in patients with C. difficile-associated diarrhea were stratified according to whether they had mild or severe disease based on clinical criteria, vancomycin was superior to metronidazole with respect to cure rate.

### 2017 Infectious Diseases Society of America clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of infectious diarrhea [^e14919c4]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Medium credibility.

Shiga toxin–producing Escherichia coli (STEC) treatment risks — treatment of STEC O157 and likely non-O157 STEC that produce Shiga toxin 2 with fluoroquinolones, β-lactams, TMP-SMX, and metronidazole in patients of all ages should be avoided because of evidence of harm; very limited data on macrolide antibiotics provide insufficient evidence of benefit and some evidence for harm favoring avoidance, and because the Shiga toxin profile is often unknown and no clear benefit exists for treating less virulent STEC infections with antibiotics, avoidance of antimicrobials is recommended among people with suspected STEC infections.

### Continuation of antibiotics is associated with failure of metronidazole for Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea [^ae426f67]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Metronidazole is first-line therapy for C. difficile-associated diarrhea primarily because of its low cost relative to vancomycin. Currently, it is unknown which patients will fail metronidazole therapy. Our goal was to prospectively evaluate risk factors for metronidazole failure.

Study

Included patients had symptomatic C. difficile-associated diarrhea, either mild or severe. Once enrolled, detailed baseline data were gathered. All interviews were performed daily while the patient was in the hospital for up to 14 days. If discharged prior to 14 days, the patient received a follow-up phone call on day 5 and day 14. Enrolled patients were given a daily stool survey to complete.

Results

We enrolled 27 patients with C. difficile-associated diarrhea. All patients (10 of 10) who had their offending antibiotic(s) discontinued had symptomatic resolution of diarrhea by day 14 of metronidazole treatment. Conversely, 59% (10 of 17) of patients who remained on antibiotics during treatment had symptomatic resolution by day 14 (P = 0.02). The risk ratio for treatment failure was 2.0 (95% confidence interval, 1.29–3.10) in patients who remained on antibiotics. In our treatment group, there would be one additional metronidazole treatment success for every 2.4 patients who discontinued antibiotics.

Conclusion

Patients who remain on antibiotics while undergoing treatment of C. difficile-associated diarrhea have a high likelihood of treatment failure with metronidazole.

### Clostridium difficile colitis [^44bbc851]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Clostridium difficile is the most common cause of infectious diarrhea in hospitalized patients. Its effects are mediated by C difficile toxins A and B. Recent outbreaks of severe colitis have been associated with a new strain of the bacterium that produces large amounts of the toxins. Although oral metronidazole and oral vancomycin can be used to treat C difficile-associated disease, intraluminal vancomycin is preferable for more severe C difficile colitis. Early surgical intervention can improve outcomes with fulminant colitis, although overall mortality remains high.

### Clostridium difficile infection: management strategies for a difficult disease [^cbdcb742]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Clostridium difficile was first described as a cause of diarrhea in 1978 and in the last three decades has reached an epidemic state with increasing incidence and severity in both healthcare and community settings. There also has been a rise in severe outcomes from C. difficile infection (CDI). There have been tremendous advancements in the field of CDI with the identification of newer risk factors, recognition of CDI in populations previously thought not at risk and development of better diagnostic modalities. Several treatment options are available for CDI apart from metronidazole and vancomycin, and include new drugs such as fidaxomicin and other options such as fecal microbiota transplantation. This review discusses the epidemiology, risk factors and outcomes from CDI, and focuses primarily on existing and evolving treatment modalities.

### A comparison of vancomycin and metronidazole for the treatment of Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea, stratified by disease severity [^59e37725]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Background

The incidence and severity of Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been increasing, and there have been recent reports of metronidazole treatment failure. Metronidazole is still commonly used as first-line treatment for CDAD but has never been compared with vancomycin in a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. We conducted such a trial, stratifying patients according to disease severity, to investigate whether one agent was superior for treating either mild or severe disease.

Methods

From October 1994 through June 2002, patients with CDAD were stratified according to whether they had mild or severe disease based on clinical criteria and were randomly assigned to receive oral metronidazole (250 mg 4 times per day) or oral vancomycin (125 mg 4 times per day) for 10 days. Both groups received an oral placebo in addition to the study drug. Patients were followed up for 21 days to assess cure, treatment failure, relapse, or intolerance.

Results

One hundred seventy-two patients were enrolled, and 150 of these patients successfully completed the trial. Among the patients with mild CDAD, treatment with metronidazole or vancomycin resulted in clinical cure in 90% and 98% of the patients, respectively (P = 0.36). Among the patients with severe CDAD, treatment with metronidazole or vancomycin resulted in clinical cure in 76% and 97% of the patients, respectively (P = 0.02). Clinical symptoms recurred in 15% of the patients treated with metronidazole and 14% of those treated with vancomycin.

Conclusions

Our findings suggest that metronidazole and vancomycin are equally effective for the treatment of mild CDAD, but vancomycin is superior for treating patients with severe CDAD.

### Management ofcolitis: insights for the gastroenterologist [^8789e047]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is a common cause of diarrhea in both inpatient and outpatient settings. The last few years have seen major changes in the treatment spectrum of CDI, most notably, recommendations against using metronidazole for initial CDI, the addition of fidaxomicin and bezlotoxumab, and emergence of microbial replacement therapies. Several other therapies are undergoing clinical trials. This narrative review focuses on the treatment of CDI with a summary of literature on the newer modalities and the treatment guidelines issued by Infectious Diseases Society of America and European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases.

### Antimotility agents for the treatment of Clostridium difficile diarrhea and colitis [^2bcbbdf0]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Antimotility agent use for the treatment of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is discouraged. We reviewed the literature and unpublished postmarketing surveillance reports regarding antimotility treatment of CDI. Twenty reports met inclusion criteria, describing 55 patients with CDI who were exposed to antimotility agents. All studies were case reports or series, with the exception of 1 retrospective review. Nineteen patients (35%) improved, with clinical resolution. Nine patients (16%) died, and 27 patients (49%) had unknown outcomes. Seventeen patients (31%) with CDI developed colonic dilation; 5 of these patients with severe CDI died. However, all patients who experienced complications or died were given antimotility agents alone initially, without an appropriate antibiotic. Twenty-three patients who received metronidazole or vancomycin coadministered with the antimotility agent experienced no complications. Evidence supporting the hypothesis that worsened outcomes are associated with antimotility therapy of CDI is lacking. Further study of the role of antimotility agents in providing symptomatic relief and reducing environmental contamination with infectious stool may be warranted.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, AMED, ClinicalTrials.gov, and Cochrane databases (search dates: inception through August 2011, limited to English-language reports); bibliography review.

Study Selection

Randomized, controlled trials of adults with C. difficile infection, independent of outcomes, who were treated with medications available in the United States. Observational studies reporting strain were included.

Data Extraction

Study design, inclusion and exclusion criteria, quality and strength of evidence as assessed by 2 reviewers, study definitions, and duration of treatment and follow-up. Outcomes included initial cure, recurrence, and treatment harms.

Data Synthesis

11 trials that included 1463 participants were identified. Three trials compared metronidazole with vancomycin; 8 compared metronidazole or vancomycin with another agent, combined agents, or placebo. Strain was analyzed in 1 trial and 2 cohort studies. No study comparing 2 antimicrobial agents demonstrated a statistically significant difference for initial cure; all comparisons were of low to moderate strength of evidence. Moderate-strength evidence from 1 study demonstrated that recurrence was decreased with fidaxomicin versus vancomycin (15% vs. 25%; difference, -10 percentage points [95% CI, -17 to -3 percentage points]; P = 0.005). Subgroup analysis of a single study comparing metronidazole with vancomycin for patients who have severe C. difficile infection showed no difference by intention-to-treat analysis; this was rated as insufficient-strength evidence. Harms, when reported, did not differ between treatments in any study.

Limitations

Definitions of diarrhea, C. difficile infection, initial cure, and relapse varied. Some studies reported insufficient detail to allow assessment of all randomly assigned participants or of harms.

Conclusion

No antimicrobial agent is clearly superior for the initial cure of C. difficile infection. Recurrence is less frequent with fidaxomicin than with vancomycin.

### Common questions about Clostridium difficile infection [^1fb4c2b0]. American Family Physician (2014). Low credibility.

Clostridium difficile infection is a common cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhea. It causes no symptoms in more than one-half of infected patients, but can also cause a wide spectrum of illnesses and death. The incidence and severity have increased in recent years. The most important modifiable risk factor for C. difficile infection is antibiotic exposure; this risk is dose-related and higher with longer courses and combination therapy. C. difficile infection is also associated with older age, recent hospitalization, multiple comorbidities, use of gastric acid blockers, inflammatory bowel disease, and immunosuppression. It has become more common in younger, healthier patients in community settings. The most practical testing options are rapid testing with nucleic acid amplification or enzyme immunoassays to detect toxin, or a two-step strategy. Treatment includes discontinuing the contributing antibiotic, if possible. Mild C. difficile infection should be treated with oral metronidazole; severe infection should be treated with oral vancomycin. Fidaxomicin may be an effective alternative. Recurrences of the infection should be treated based on severity. Tapering and the pulsed-dose method of oral vancomycin therapy for second recurrences are effective. Prevention includes responsible antibiotic prescribing and vigilant handwashing. Probiotics prevent antibiotic-associated diarrhea, but are not recommended specifically for preventing C. difficile infection.

Metronidazole

Oral metronidazole has been widely used as first-line treatment of CDI in the United States since 1994, when the Hospital Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were published and cautioned against the use of oral vancomycin because of concern for potential resistance in enterococci. Although this agent is still effective for the treatment of mild to moderate CDI, multiple recent reports show increased failure rates and slower time to symptom resolution. In addition, oral metronidazole was shown to be inferior to vancomycin for treatment of severe CDI in 2 recent randomized comparative trials but was not significantly different in another trial. The recent Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America (SHEA)/Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines give interim recommendations for determination of severity based on white blood cell count and serum creatinine level; however, a validated severity score is still needed. Metronidazole is highly absorbed, and fecal concentrations are nil in asymptomatic C. difficile carriers, with only modest levels achieved in patients with diarrhea. Therefore, metronidazole is not the ideal agent for use in a disease that is limited to infection in the colon. In addition, there are some reports of clinical isolates with moderately increased metronidazole MICs. Because it is effective in mild to moderate CDI and is relatively inexpensive, oral metronidazole is still widely used.

Nitazoxanide

Nitazoxanide is a thiazolide compound that has antiparasitic activity in vivo and activity against numerous gram-positive and gram-negative anaerobic bacteria in vitro. In small clinical CDI treatment studies comparing nitazoxanide with metronidazole and vancomycin, it had shown similar response rates to both the comparative drugs. The small size of these studies does not permit conclusions about noninferiority or superiority to metronidazole or vancomycin. In another study of patients given a 10-day course of nitazoxanide after their CDI failed to respond to 14 days of metronidazole therapy, clinical cure was achieved in 54%, but relapse and failure occurred in 20% and 26% of patients, respectively (although 3 failures and 1 recurrence responded to a second course of nitazoxanide). Larger studies comparing the efficacy of nitazoxanide with that of standard therapies are needed to help define its place in the management of CDI and to test its noninferiority to currently available agents.

### Clostridium difficile infection: a review of current and emerging therapies [^e35a030f]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Concluding remarks

Although the efficacy of metronidazole is declining, it remains the initial therapy for the majority of patients who have mild-to-moderate infection, and as the treatment of choice for the first recurrent episode of CDI. Vancomycin continues to be recommended as initial therapy for severe CDI. Early surgical consultation is required in the event of severe complicated CDI.

The treatment of multiple recurrences of CDI is challenging. The use of FMT presents an enormous breakthrough as a therapy for recurrent CDI, however multicenter RCTs with long-term follow up are essential to assess the efficacy and safety of FMT.

There are many novel treatment strategies emerging involving the use of non-antibiotics, which appear promising. They provide optimistic approaches to future therapy. However, there is limited knowledge about the safety and efficacy of these treatments. Further research should be conducted to enable these treatment modalities to be widely accepted.

Antimicrobial treatment

The healthy human gut is host to a diverse microbiota which protects it from pathogenic bacteria by competitive exclusion and production of bacteriocins. When this microbial milieu is perturbed ('gut dysbiosis'), the host becomes susceptible to infections. In order to develop CDI, both gut dysbiosis and colonization with C. difficile bacterium are predisposing factors. The ideal therapeutic agent for CDI is one that successfully kills the bacterium while restoring the disrupted gut microbiota.

Several drugs are used to treat CDI, each with its own spectrum of activity, efficacy, and toxicities. Metronidazole is the oldest drug used for CDI treatment, although it is not recommended by the United States (US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for this purpose and is not recommended by the 2017 IDSA/SHEA guideline in most situations. It is a broad-spectrum antibiotic used to treat anaerobic infections. Metronidazole kills the vegetative forms of the Clostridioides bacterium but not the spores. Thus, it terminates the infection, but leaves the patient susceptible to recurrences in the face of persistent or renewed risk factors for CDI. Metronidazole is almost completely absorbed in the small intestine with undetectable levels in the feces of healthy adults. In the presence of diarrhea however, the levels of the drug in feces increase; this is likely due to the decreased transit time and secretion of the drug across an inflamed colonic mucosa. Since it is absorbed from the gut, systemic side effects are of concern when repeated or prolonged courses are used.

### Effectiveness and appropriateness of empiric metronidazole for Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea [^4f43ffef]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

Although Clostridium difficile is the most common infectious etiology of nosocomial diarrhea, noninfectious causes are far more common. Empiric initiation of therapy for all patients is of unknown value. The aim of this study was to determine benefits of empiric metronidazole for Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD).

Methods

We conducted a 4-month prospective surveillance of all patients in two community teaching hospitals receiving metronidazole for empiric treatment of presumptive CDAD. A database including antibiotic usage, fever, white blood cell count, feeding formula usage, comorbidity, and response to therapy was maintained.

Results

Seventy-one patients on the medical (50), surgical (18), obstetric (two), and trauma (one) service were identified. Sixty-two had nosocomial diarrhea; nine had diarrhea on admission. Seventy (97%) received antibiotics; one (3%) was on nelfinavir only. Eighteen (25%) were subsequently proven to have CDAD; two (3%) had laxative-induced diarrhea; two (3%) had diarrhea secondary to a medication (colchicine [one] and nelfinavir [one]); one (1%) had diarrhea caused by bowel preparation for colonoscopy. The remaining 49 (68%) did not have a clearly established diarrhea etiology. (Four did not undergo stool examination.) Statistical analysis (chi(2) test) demonstrated a significant decrease in symptoms for metronidazole-treated patients with CDAD versus those with a different diagnosis (p = 0.05). Not surprisingly, multivariate regression analysis identified a strong correlation of diagnosing CDAD with age > 60 yr, antibiotics exposure, fever, elevated white blood cell count, and resolution of symptoms with specific metronidazole treatment. CDAD was definitively diagnosed in 25% of our hospitalized patients with diarrhea, consistent with published data. Although some cases might have been missed, most patients did not have CDAD and received no benefit (and were potentially harmed) by empiric metronidazole. There was no way a priori to distinguish CDAD from non-CDAD.

Conclusions

In the absence of clear guidelines, empiric metronidazole should be reserved for strongly presumptive CDAD patients (older patients with comorbid conditions receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics associated with CDAD) who cannot hemodynamically or otherwise tolerate diarrhea. Used judiciously, empiric therapy may more rapidly resolve symptoms, and could conceivably prevent/abate severe complications and nosocomial spread.

### Factors associated with failure of metronidazole in Clostridium difficile-associated disease [^2d3a5e29]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2004). Low credibility.

Goal

To identify patients likely to fail metronidazole as initial treatment of C. difficile infection.

Background

For moderate to severe Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea, metronidazole is the drug of choice for treatment. Oral vancomycin is given to patients who fail metronidazole or have intolerable side effects.

Study

Retrospective review identified all patients treated for C. difficile-associated diarrhea during hospitalization from January 2000 to September 2001. C difficile was documented by a positive toxin assay or pseudomembranes on colonoscopy. Metronidazole failure was defined as persistent symptoms of C. difficile-associated diarrhea after 5 days of uninterrupted therapy. Response was defined as improvement in symptoms at day 5 of therapy including reduction of diarrhea to ≤ 2 bowel movements per day.

Results

119 C. difficile-associated diarrhea patients were identified, and 99 met inclusion criteria. There were 61 (62%) metronidazole responders and 38 (38%) treatment failures. Albumin < 2.5g/l and intensive care unit stay at/prior to diagnosis were the only variables associated with treatment failure. The odds ratios for treatment failure were 11.7 (95% confidence interval: 4.0–31.6) and 4.1 (95% confidence interval: 1.3–12.2), respectively. When considering these 2 variables together (low albumin, intensive care unit care), the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.80 for predicting treatment failure.

Conclusions

Albumin level < 2.5g/l and intensive care unit stay were predictors of failure of metronidazole therapy for C. difficile-associated diarrhea. These patients may benefit from oral vancomycin therapy at outset.

### Antibiotic treatment for Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea in adults [^4e4b9077]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Clostridium difficile is recognized as a frequent cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhea and colitis.

Objectives

The aim of this review is to investigate the efficacy of antibiotic therapy for C. difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD).

Search Strategy

MEDLINE (1966 to March 24, 2010), EMBASE (1980 to March 24, 2010), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and the Cochrane IBD/FBD Review Group Specialized Trials Register were searched using the following search terms: "pseudomembranous colitis and randomized trial"; "Clostridium difficile and randomized trial"; "antibiotic associated diarrhea and randomized trial".

Selection Criteria

Only randomized, controlled trials assessing antibiotic treatment for CDAD were included in the review. The following outcomes were sought: initial resolution of diarrhea; initial conversion of stool to cytotoxin and/or culture negative; recurrence of diarrhea; recurrence of fecal evidence of CDAD; patient response to cessation of prior antibiotic therapy; emergent surgery; and death.

Data Collection and Analysis

Three authors independently assessed abstracts and full text articles for inclusion. The risk of bias was independently rated by two authors. For dichotomous outcomes, relative risks (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were derived from each study and summary statistics obtained when appropriate, using a fixed effects model, except where significant heterogeneity was detected, at which time a random effects model was used.

Main Results

Fifteen studies (total of 1152 participants) with CDAD were included. Nine different antibiotics were investigated: vancomycin, metronidazole, fusidic acid, nitazoxanide, teicoplanin, rifampin, rifaximin, bacitracin and fidaxomicin (OPT-80). Most of the studies were active comparator studies comparing vancomycin with other antibiotics. The risk of bias was rated as high for 12 of 15 included studies. Patients with severe CDAD were often excluded from the included studies. In the only placebo-controlled trial vancomycin was found to be superior to placebo for treatment of CDAD for initial symptomatic cure. Initial symptomatic cure was achieved in 41% of vancomycin patients compared to 4% of placebo patients (1 study; 44 patients; RR 9.00; 95% CI 1.24 to 65.16). Vancomycin was significantly superior to placebo for initial bacteriologic response. Initial bacteriologic response was achieved in 45% of vancomycin patients compared to 4% of placebo patients (1 study; 44 patients; RR 10.00; 95% CI 1.40 to 71.62). The results of this study should be interpreted with caution due to the small number of patients and high risk of bias. No statistically significant differences in efficacy were found between vancomycin and metronidazole, vancomycin and fusidic acid, vancomycin and nitazoxanide, or vancomycin and rifaximin. No statistically significant differences in efficacy were found between metronidazole and nitazoxanide or metronidazole and fusidic acid. Vancomycin was significantly superior to bacitracin for initial bacteriologic response. Initial bacteriologic response was achieved in 48% of vancomycin patients compared to 25% of bacitracin patients (2 studies; 104 patients; RR 0.52; 95% CI 0.31 to 0.86). Teicoplanin, an antibiotic of limited availability and great cost, was significantly superior to vancomycin for initial bacteriologic response and cure. Initial bacteriologic response was achieved in 62% of vancomycin patients compared to 87% of teicoplanin patients (2 studies; 110 patients; RR 1.43; 95% CI 1.14 to 1.81). Bacteriologic cure was achieved in 45% of vancomycin patients compared to 82% of teicoplanin patients (2 studies; 110 patients; RR 1.82; 95% CI 1.19 to 2.78). These results should be interpreted with caution due to the small number of patients and the high risk of bias in the two studies in the pooled analysis. Teicoplanin was significantly superior to metronidazole for initial bacteriologic response. Initial bacteriologic response was achieved in 71% of metronidazole patients compared to 93% of teicoplanin patients (1 study; 59 patients; RR 0.76; 95% CI 0.60 to 0.98). This result should be interpreted with caution due to the small number of patients and high risk of bias in the study. Only one study investigated synergistic antibiotic combination, metronidazole and rifampin, and no advantage was demonstrated for the drug combination. This result should be interpreted with caution due to the small number of patients and high risk of bias in the study. Adverse events including surgery and death occurred infrequently in the included studies. There was a total of 18 deaths among 1152 patients in this systematic review. Among the studies that commented on the cause of mortality the deaths were attributed to underlying disease rather than CDAD or antibiotic treatment. One study reported a partial colectomy after failed CDAD treatment.

Authors' Conclusions

Current evidence leads to uncertainty whether mild CDAD needs to be treated. The studies provide little evidence for antibiotic treatment of severe CDAD as many studies excluded these patients. Considering the two goals of therapy: improvement of the patient's clinical condition and prevention of spread of C. difficile infection to other patients, one should choose the antibiotic that brings both symptomatic cure and bacteriologic cure. A recommendation to achieve these goals cannot be made because of the small numbers of patients in the included studies and the high risk of bias in these studies, especially related to dropouts. Most of the active comparator studies found no statistically significant difference in efficacy between vancomycin and other antibiotics including metronidazole, fusidic acid, nitazoxanide or rifaximin. Teicoplanin may be an attractive choice but for its limited availability (Teicoplanin is not available in the USA) and great cost relative to the other options. More research of antibiotic treatment and other treatment modalities of CDAD is required.

### Giardiasis treatment: an update with a focus on refractory disease [^93dcdc8f]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Giardiasis remains a common cause of diarrhea and intestinal enteropathy globally. Here we give an overview of clinical treatment studies and discuss potential mechanisms and molecular targets for in-vitro testing of drug resistance.

Recent Findings

Giardia is a cause of disease both in diarrheal and nondiarrheal cases. The prevalence of treatment refractory giardiasis is increasing. Recent studies reveal 5-nitroimidazole refractory infection occurs in up to 50% of cases. Mechanisms of drug resistance are not known. Placebo controlled studies of drug efficacy, taking the self-limiting course of giardiasis into account, has not been reported. No randomized controlled trials of treatment of refractory infection have been performed the last 25 years. Based on the clinical studies reported, combination treatment with a 5-nitroimidazole and a benzimidazole is more effective than repeated courses of 5-nitroimidazole or monotherapies in refractory cases. Quinacrine is effective in refractory cases, but potentially severe side effects limit its use.

Summary

A combination of a 5-nitroimidazole and albendazole or mebendazole, and quinacrine monotherapy, are rational choices in nitroimidazole refractory infections, but randomized controlled studies are needed. Further research into more recent clinical isolates is necessary to uncover mechanisms for the increase in metronidazole refractory giardiasis observed during the last decade.

### The American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons clinical practice guidelines for the management of Clostridioides difficile infection [^dbafa963]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2021). High credibility.

Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) — initial treatment for an initial episode: Oral vancomycin or fidaxomicin is considered first-line treatment for an initial CDI, whereas metronidazole alone is no longer considered appropriate first-line treatment; Grade of recommendation: Strong recommendation based on high-quality evidence, 1A. For nonfulminant CDI, the recommended oral vancomycin dose is 125 mg 4 times a day and the recommended fidaxomicin dose is 200 mg twice a day; a 10-day course of either medication resolves CDI diarrhea in > 90% of patients. Evidence synthesis shows vancomycin was more effective in achieving a cure (79%) than metronidazole (72%); relative risk (RR), 0.90; 95% CI, 0.84–0.97, and metronidazole was inferior to vancomycin in initial cure rate (RR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.84–0.98; P = 0.02) and sustained cure rate (RR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.82–0.96; P = 0.003). Combination therapy with both vancomycin and metronidazole is associated with a higher rate of adverse events compared with monotherapy and is not typically recommended unless patients have severe-complicated or fulminant CDI.

### Antibiotic treatment for Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea in adults [^c8f2de42]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) is recognized as a frequent cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhea and colitis.

Objectives

The aim of this review is to establish the efficacy of antibiotic therapy for C. difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD), to identify the most effective antibiotic treatment for CDAD in adults and to determine the need for stopping the causative antibiotic during therapy.

Search Strategy

MEDLINE (1966 to 2003), EMBASE (1980 to 2003), Cochrane Central Database of Controlled Trials and the Cochrane IBD Review Group Specialized Trials Register were searched using the following search terms: "pseudomembranous colitis and randomized trial"; "Clostridium difficile and randomized trial"; "antibiotic associated diarrhea and randomized trial".

Selection Criteria

Only randomized, controlled trials assessing antibiotic treatment for CDAD were included in the review. Probiotic trials are excluded. The following outcomes were sought: initial resolution of diarrhea; initial conversion of stool to C. difficile cytotoxin and/or stool culture negative; recurrence of diarrhea; recurrence of fecal C. difficile cytotoxin and/or positive stool culture; patient response to cessation of prior antibiotic therapy; sepsis; emergent surgery: fecal diversion or colectomy; and death.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were analyzed using the MetaView statistical package in Review Manager. For dichotomous outcomes, relative risks (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were derived from each study. When appropriate, the results of included studies were combined for each outcome. For dichotomous outcomes, pooled RR and 95% CI were calculated using a fixed effect model, except where significant heterogeneity was detected, at which time the random effects model was used. Data heterogeneity was calculated using MetaView.

Main Results

Of eleven studies identified, two were subsequently excluded because patients were stool positive for C. difficile, but did not have diarrhea or because the study was not a randomized controlled trial. All of the remaining nine studies involved patients with diarrhea who recently received antibiotics for an infection other than C. difficile. The definition of diarrhea ranged from at least two loose stools per day with an associated symptom such as rectal temperature > 38(o)C, to at least six loose stools in 36 hours. In terms of symptomatic cure, metronidazole, bacitracin and fusidic acid were not shown to be less effective than vancomycin. Teicoplanin may be slightly more effective than vancomycin with a relative risk of 1.21 [95% CI 1.00 to 1.46] and a p-value of 0.06. In terms of initial symptomatic resolution, vancomycin is more effective than placebo with a relative risk of 6.75 [95% CI 1.16 to 48.43] and a p-value of 0.03. This result should be interpreted with caution given the small number of patients in this comparison (12 in the vancomycin group and nine in the placebo group) and the poor methodological quality of the trial. Metronidazole, bacitracin, teicoplanin, fusidic acid and rifaximine are as effective as vancomycin for initial symptomatic resolution. The other secondary outcomes measured in this review: surgery, sepsis and death occurred infrequently in all of the studies.

Authors' Conclusions

Current evidence leads to uncertainty whether mild CDAD needs to be treated. Patients with mild CDAD may resolve their symptoms as quickly without treatment. The only placebo-controlled study shows vancomycin's superior efficacy. However, this result should be treated with caution due to the small number of patients enrolled and the poor methodological quality of the trial. The Johnson study of asymptomatic carriers also shows that placebo is better than vancomycin or metronidazole for eliminating C. difficile in stool during follow-up. If one does decide to treat, then two goals of therapy need to be kept in mind: improvement of the patient's clinical condition and prevention of spread of C. difficile infection to other patients. Given these two considerations, one should choose the antibiotic that brings both symptomatic cure and bacteriologic cure. In this regard, teicoplanin appears to be the best choice because the available evidence suggests that it is better than vancomycin for bacteriologic cure and has borderline superior effectiveness in terms of symptomatic cure. Teicoplanin is not readily available in the United States, which must be taken into account when making treatment decisions in that country.

### 2017 Infectious Diseases Society of America clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of infectious diarrhea [^3d7d2d73]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Medium credibility.

Recommended antimicrobial agents by pathogen — parasitic enteric infections: Cryptosporidium spp — nitazoxanide for HIV-uninfected and for HIV-infected in combination with effective combination antiretroviral therapy (cART); effective cART alone is listed for treatment, and immune reconstitution may lead to microbiologic and clinical response. Cyclospora cayetanensis — first choice TMP-SMX (trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole), with nitazoxanide as a limited-data alternative; patients with HIV infection may require higher doses or longer durations of TMP-SMX. Giardia lamblia — first choice tinidazole, with metronidazole as an alternative; tinidazole is approved in the United States for children aged ≥ 3 years and can be crushed, whereas metronidazole has a high frequency of gastrointestinal side effects, lacks a commercial pediatric suspension (can be compounded), and is not FDA approved for giardiasis. Cystoisospora belli — first choice TMP-SMX with pyrimethamine as an alternative and potential second-line alternatives of ciprofloxacin or nitazoxanide. Trichinella spp — first choice albendazole with mebendazole as an alternative; therapy is less effective in the late stage when larvae encyst in muscle.

### Comparison of clinical and microbiological response to treatment of Clostridium difficile-associated disease with metronidazole and vancomycin [^0ae22129]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Background

There have been recent reports of frequent treatment failure associated with the use of metronidazole for treatment of Clostridium difficile-associated disease. We tested the hypothesis that treatment failure with metronidazole is associated with a suboptimal microbiological response in comparison with that of vancomycin.

Methods

We conducted a 9-month prospective observational study of patients with C. difficile-associated disease. Cox proportional hazards models were used to compare metronidazole-treated and vancomycin-treated patients in terms of time to resolution of diarrhea and time to reduction of C. difficile in stool to an undetectable level.

Results

Of 52 study patients with C. difficile-associated disease, 34 (65%) received initial therapy with oral metronidazole, and 18 (35%) received initial therapy with oral vancomycin. Diarrhea resolved in > 90% of patients who completed 10 days of treatment with either agent. However, vancomycin-treated patients were more likely to develop undetectable levels of C. difficile (adjusted hazard ratio, 3.99; 95% confidence interval, 1.41–11.3; P = 0.009) and to have resolution of diarrhea (adjusted hazard ratio, 4.17; 95% confidence interval, 1.53–11.40; P = 0.005) during the first 5 days of therapy. Ten metronidazole-treated patients (29%) had their treatment changed to oral vancomycin because of persistent symptoms. Seven (70%) of these 10 patients had < 1 log reduction in C.difficile concentration; however, only 4 had completed ≥ 6 days of metronidazole treatment at the time of the treatment change.

Conclusion

In an observational study with a limited number of subjects, a majority of patients with C. difficile-associated disease responded to therapy with metronidazole or vancomycin. Failure with metronidazole treatment may be attributable to a slower and less consistent microbiological response than that with oral vancomycin treatment.

### Plasmid-mediated metronidazole resistance in Clostridioides difficile [^164f3c7d]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

As more reports are published associating metronidazole with higher treatment failure, a shift in consensus for using metronidazole as first-line treatment for mild to moderate CDI is occurring. The reason for treatment failure is currently unknown, but no correlation between MTZ R C. difficile isolates and treatment failure seems to exist. We also observed that clinical isolates from subjects in which metronidazole treatment failed, were metronidazole susceptible and pCD-METRO negative (Supplementary Data 1). These observations, however, do not rule out a role for (other) metronidazole-resistant organisms, potentially harboring pCD-METRO, in treatment failure. Indeed, levels of metronidazole at the end of the colon and in fecal material are low (most likely due to absorption of the drug in the small intestine in the absence of diarrhea), and members of the microbiota involved in inactivation or sequestering of metronidazole may allow for growth of MTZ S species –.

Our observation of a putatively transmissible plasmid associated with metronidazole resistance in C. difficile and the gut microbiome has implications for clinical practice. First, it warrants a further investigation into the role of the plasmid in metronidazole treatment failure in CDI, and — more broadly — in metronidazole resistance of organisms other than C. difficile. Second, though this work can be seen as one more argument against the use of metronidazole as a first-line treatment of CDI, detection of the plasmid in fecal material might also guide treatment decisions (i.e. pCD-METRO harboring patients are excluded from metronidazole treatment). And finally, screening by PCR of fecal donor material intended for FMT might be desirable to reduce the possibility of transferring pCD-METRO from hitherto uncharacterized donor organisms to C. difficile in patients.

### Management of Clostridium difficile infection in inflammatory bowel disease: expert review from the clinical practice updates committee of the AGA institute [^12c9720d]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2017). Low credibility.

The purpose of this expert review is to synthesize the existing evidence on the management of Clostridium difficile infection in patients with underlying inflammatory bowel disease. The evidence reviewed in this article is a summation of relevant scientific publications, expert opinion statements, and current practice guidelines. This review is a summary of expert opinion in the field without a formal systematic review of evidence. Best Practice Advice 1: Clinicians should test patients who present with a flare of underlying inflammatory bowel disease for Clostridium difficile infection. Best Practice Advice 2: Clinicians should screen for recurrent C difficile infection if diarrhea or other symptoms of colitis persist or return after antibiotic treatment for C difficile infection. Best Practice Advice 3: Clinicians should consider treating C difficile infection in inflammatory bowel disease patients with vancomycin instead of metronidazole. Best Practice Advice 4: Clinicians strongly should consider hospitalization for close monitoring and aggressive management for inflammatory bowel disease patients with C difficile infection who have profuse diarrhea, severe abdominal pain, a markedly increased peripheral blood leukocyte count, or other evidence of sepsis. Best Practice Advice 5: Clinicians may postpone escalation of steroids and other immunosuppression agents during acute C difficile infection until therapy for C difficile infection has been initiated. However, the decision to withhold or continue immunosuppression in inflammatory bowel disease patients with C difficile infection should be individualized because there is insufficient existing robust literature on which to develop firm recommendations. Best Practice Advice 6: Clinicians should offer a referral for fecal microbiota transplantation to inflammatory bowel disease patients with recurrent C difficile infection.

### Evolution of clinical guidelines for antimicrobial management ofinfection [^59c2c3c4]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases

In 2009, Bauer et al. organized the first true European treatment guideline (Table 2). Within these guidelines, we saw the evolution of recommendations now acknowledging the importance of triaging the patient's severity of disease. The authors were less definitive with regards to which factors were most important, instead choosing to list a group of considerations for disease severity including laboratory investigations (e.g. WBC > 15 × 10 9 /l, band neutrophils > 20% of leukocytes, rise in serum creatinine (Cr) > 50% above baseline, elevated serum lactate), endoscopic findings (e.g. pseudomembranous colitis), and imaging (e.g. distension of the large bowel). The authors felt that there was insufficient evidence to set more definitive criteria for severity, but remarked that severity of disease should play a role in antimicrobial treatment choice. This relates back to the Zar et al. study that supported vancomycin use ahead of metronidazole in those with more severe forms of CDI.

### Antibiotic treatment for Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhoea in adults [^86aeccbe]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) is recognized as a frequent cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea and colitis. This review is an update of a previously published Cochrane review.

Objectives

The aim of this review is to investigate the efficacy and safety of antibiotic therapy for C. difficile-associated diarrhoea (CDAD), or C. difficile infection (CDI), being synonymous terms.

Search Methods

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL and the Cochrane IBD Group Specialized Trials Register from inception to 26 January 2017. We also searched clinicaltrials.gov and clinicaltrialsregister.eu for ongoing trials.

Selection Criteria

Only randomised controlled trials assessing antibiotic treatment for CDI were included in the review.

Data Collection and Analysis

Three authors independently assessed abstracts and full text articles for inclusion and extracted data. The risk of bias was independently rated by two authors. For dichotomous outcomes, we calculated the risk ratio (RR) and corresponding 95% confidence interval (95% CI). We pooled data using a fixed-effect model, except where significant heterogeneity was detected, at which time a random-effects model was used. The following outcomes were sought: sustained symptomatic cure (defined as initial symptomatic response and no recurrence of CDI), sustained bacteriologic cure, adverse reactions to the intervention, death and cost.

Main Results

Twenty-two studies (3215 participants) were included. The majority of studies enrolled patients with mild to moderate CDI who could tolerate oral antibiotics. Sixteen of the included studies excluded patients with severe CDI and few patients with severe CDI were included in the other six studies. Twelve different antibiotics were investigated: vancomycin, metronidazole, fusidic acid, nitazoxanide, teicoplanin, rifampin, rifaximin, bacitracin, cadazolid, LFF517, surotomycin and fidaxomicin. Most of the studies were active comparator studies comparing vancomycin with other antibiotics. One small study compared vancomycin to placebo. There were no other studies that compared antibiotic treatment to a placebo or a 'no treatment' control group. The risk of bias was rated as high for 17 of 22 included studies. Vancomycin was found to be more effective than metronidazole for achieving symptomatic cure. Seventy-two per cent (318/444) of metronidazole patients achieved symptomatic cure compared to 79% (339/428) of vancomycin patients (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.84 to 0.97; moderate quality evidence). Fidaxomicin was found to be more effective than vancomycin for achieving symptomatic cure. Seventy-one per cent (407/572) of fidaxomicin patients achieved symptomatic cure compared to 61% (361/592) of vancomycin patients (RR 1.17, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.31; moderate quality evidence). Teicoplanin may be more effective than vancomycin for achieving a symptomatic cure. Eightly-seven per cent (48/55) of teicoplanin patients achieved symptomatic cure compared to 73% (40/55) of vancomycin patients (RR 1.21, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.46; very low quality evidence). For other comparisons including the one placebo-controlled study the quality of evidence was low or very low due to imprecision and in many cases high risk of bias because of attrition and lack of blinding. One hundred and forty deaths were reported in the studies, all of which were attributed by study authors to the co-morbidities of the participants that lead to acquiring CDI. Although many other adverse events were reported during therapy, these were attributed to the participants' co-morbidities. The only adverse events directly attributed to study medication were rare nausea and transient elevation of liver enzymes. Recent cost data (July 2016) for a 10 day course of treatment shows that metronidazole 500 mg is the least expensive antibiotic with a cost of USD 13 (Health Warehouse). Vancomycin 125 mg costs USD 1779 (Walgreens for 56 tablets) compared to fidaxomicin 200 mg at USD 3453.83 or more (Optimer Pharmaceuticals) and teicoplanin at approximately USD 83.67 (GBP 71.40, British National Formulary).

Authors' Conclusions

No firm conclusions can be drawn regarding the efficacy of antibiotic treatment in severe CDI as most studies excluded patients with severe disease. The lack of any 'no treatment' control studies does not allow for any conclusions regarding the need for antibiotic treatment in patients with mild CDI beyond withdrawal of the initiating antibiotic. Nonetheless, moderate quality evidence suggests that vancomycin is superior to metronidazole and fidaxomicin is superior to vancomycin. The differences in effectiveness between these antibiotics were not too large and the advantage of metronidazole is its far lower cost compared to the other two antibiotics. The quality of evidence for teicoplanin is very low. Adequately powered studies are needed to determine if teicoplanin performs as well as the other antibiotics. A trial comparing the two cheapest antibiotics, metronidazole and teicoplanin, would be of interest.

Recommended antimicrobial agents by pathogen — bacterial enteric infections: Campylobacter — first choice azithromycin; alternative ciprofloxacin. Clostridium difficile — first choice oral vancomycin; alternative fidaxomicin, with the comment that "Fidaxomicin not currently recommended for people < 18 years of age" and that metronidazole remains acceptable for nonsevere Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) in children and as a second-line agent for adults with nonsevere CDI. Nontyphoidal Salmonella enterica — antimicrobial therapy is usually not indicated for uncomplicated infection; therapy should be considered for groups at increased risk for invasive infection (neonates up to 3 months old; persons > 50 years old with suspected atherosclerosis; persons with immunosuppression, cardiac disease, or significant joint disease). Salmonella enterica Typhi or Paratyphi — first choice ceftriaxone or ciprofloxacin; alternatives include ampicillin or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) or azithromycin. Shigella — first choice azithromycin or ciprofloxacin, or ceftriaxone; alternatives include TMP-SMX or ampicillin if susceptible, and clinicians should avoid prescribing fluoroquinolones if the ciprofloxacin MIC is 0.12 µg/ml or higher even if the laboratory report identifies the isolate as susceptible. Most clinical laboratories do not test for azithromycin susceptibility.

### Management ofcolitis: insights for the gastroenterologist [^71c4df96]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The therapeutic landscape against CDI is rapidly evolving with accumulation of evidence from clinical trials and observational studies. At present, vancomycin and fidaxomicin are the drugs of choice in treating primary as well as recurrent CDI; the use of metronidazole is limited to severe-complicated disease. FMT should be offered to patients with multiply recurrent CDI. Further research into the treatment of recurrent and severe disease is warranted. Several drugs and microbiota-based products are undergoing clinical trials and may soon join the armamentarium available to physicians and patients to combat CDI.

### Treatment of Clostridium difficile-associated disease [^a5adb239]. Gastroenterology (2009). Low credibility.

Clostridium difficile infection is an increasing burden to the health care system, totaling more than $1 billion/year in the United States. Treatment of patients with C difficile infection with metronidazole or vancomycin reduces morbidity and mortality, although the number of patients that do not respond to metronidazole is increasing. Despite initial response rates of greater than 90%, 15%-30% of patients have a relapse in symptoms after successful initial therapy, usually in the first few weeks after treatment is discontinued. Failure to develop specific antibody response has recently been identified as a critical factor in recurrence. The review discusses the different management strategies for initial and recurrent symptomatic C difficile infections.

### Safety and efficacy of fidaxomicin in the treatment of Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea [^a48ae2c0]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD) is the most common cause of healthcare-associated diarrhea. The current recommended treatment regimens of metronidazole and vancomycin have not changed in nearly 25 years. Fidaxomicin, an exceedingly narrow spectrum macrolide antibiotic, was recently approved for the treatment of CDAD. In phase III clinical trials, fidaxomicin was noninferior to vancomycin in achieving clinical cure of CDAD. Furthermore, fidaxomicin was associated with fewer recurrences of CDAD compared with vancomycin in clinical trials. These results, combined with the ease of administration and a good safety profile, make fidaxomicin an attractive treatment option for treating CDAD.

Microsporidiosis — alternative agents and preferences: Other agents, including nitazoxanide, atovaquone, metronidazole, and fluoroquinolones, have been reported to reduce diarrhea associated with microsporidiosis infection; however, metronidazole and atovaquone are not active in vitro or in animal models and should not be used to treat microsporidiosis. The role of alternative agents or the use of combination regimens for initial therapy is unknown; albendazole remains the preferred initial therapy for gastrointestinal (GI) tract and disseminated infection caused by microsporidia other than E. bieneusi and V. corneae.

### Guidelines for diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of Clostridium difficile infections [^cae68d5b]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is a leading cause of hospital-associated gastrointestinal illness and places a high burden on our health-care system. Patients with CDI typically have extended lengths-of-stay in hospitals, and CDI is a frequent cause of large hospital outbreaks of disease. This guideline provides recommendations for the diagnosis and management of patients with CDI as well as for the prevention and control of outbreaks while supplementing previously published guidelines. New molecular diagnostic stool tests will likely replace current enzyme immunoassay tests. We suggest treatment of patients be stratified depending on whether they have mild-to-moderate, severe, or complicated disease. Therapy with metronidazole remains the choice for mild-to-moderate disease but may not be adequate for patients with severe or complicated disease. We propose a classification of disease severity to guide therapy that is useful for clinicians. We review current treatment options for patients with recurrent CDI and recommendations for the control and prevention of outbreaks of CDI.

### Evolution of clinical guidelines for antimicrobial management ofinfection [^014e33e9]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Australasian society for infectious disease

As the third contribution from this grouping, the Australasian guidelines mostly followed suit with the previously published recommendations (Tables 4 and 5). They were similar to the European and IDSA/SHEA guidelines with regards to treatment of initial, first, and two or more recurrences, with the caveat that they recommended metronidazole 400 mg orally three times daily instead of the 500 mg dose recommended by the other societies. Also, the Australasian guidelines recommended triaging severity using a long list of potential factors, similar to the European guidance from 2009, instead of the two factors recommended by the IDSA/SHEA in 2010.

Table 4.
Australasian Society for Infectious Disease guidelines.

Table 5.
Australasian Society for Infectious Disease.

What we can see from the Australasian contribution is the great interest in CDI and the many different treatment approaches being considered as the incidence of disease was increasing and the epidemic worsening (Table 5). From this extensive list of 'potential' regimens, this guideline was the first to mention fecal enema, rifaximin, and antibodies to toxin A or B as having some evidence but an unclear role. This was in fact a vision of the future among many other therapies that did not ultimately gain the evidence needed to be formally placed within subsequent guideline recommendations.

American College of Gastroenterology

In 2013, the American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) published their guidelines (Table 6). They recommended triaging severity based upon patients having an albumin < 3 mg/dl plus either WBC ⩾ 15,000 cells/mm 3 or abdominal tenderness. This was in contrast to the IDSA/SHEA 2010 guideline recommending a focus on WBC and creatinine. The justification for using albumin and WBC was that these were direct indicators of toxin activity (e.g. protein losing colopathy and leukemoid reaction) versus the creatinine being an indicator of volume shifts secondary to the diarrheal syndrome. One could argue that albumin is an acute-phase reactant and that those patients who are nutritionally depleted, and therefore have a low albumin, are at risk for CDI as well, making this a less accurate measurement. Various studies support all three (e.g. WBC, Cr, and albumin) being predictors of 30-day colectomy, mortality, or both.

### Initial therapy affects duration of diarrhoea in critically ill patients with Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) [^f6fcdeff]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Current treatment recommendations for CDI rely mainly on the severity of disease and clinical presentations like fever, hypovolemia, lactic acidosis and signs for end-organ failure.

The mainstay of CDI therapy is now considered oral vancomycin whereas metronidazole is reserved for mild disease and intolerance towards vancomycin; furthermore, vancomycin is always recommended in cases with severe disease. Metronidazole IV should be added in severe to fulminant disease. Furthermore, early surgical consultation is recommended in patients who do not respond to conventional therapy within 3 days. Specific recommendations on CDI therapy for critically ill patients are lacking.

Our study objective was the characterization of critically ill patients with CDI and identification of risk factors for unfortunate outcomes as well as analysis of the best antibiotic treatment.

### The role of acute care surgery in the treatment of severe, complicated Clostridium difficile-associated disease [^50109fb1]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Clostridium difficile associated disease (CDAD) is the result of colonic bacterial overgrowth with this gram positive anaerobic organism and the production of toxins that typically induce diarrhea. Most patients with CDAD respond to treatment with oral metronidazole or vancomycin, but a subset of patients will develop a severe systemic illness, multiple organ failure, and death. There are no reliable combinations of clinical or laboratory findings that will distinguish patients who will respond to medical therapy and those who will progress to a more complicated state. Early surgical consultation should be considered in patients with ileus, severe abdominal pain, significant tenderness, immunosuppression, advanced age, high white blood cell or band counts, acute renal failure, mental status changes, or cardiopulmonary compromise. The standard operation for fulminant colitis is subtotal colectomy but the high mortality of the operation, and the long-term morbidity even in survivors combine to act as deterrents to early surgical consultation and operation. Novel operative approaches that preserve the colon and minimize operative morbidity may prove to remove the barriers to earlier surgical treatment for fulminant CDAD and improve outcomes.

### A 76-year-old man with recurrent Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea: review of C. difficile infection [^a0fb78cc]. JAMA (2009). Excellent credibility.

Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is a common and increasingly severe nosocomial infectious disease. The case of Mr S, a 76-year-old man with multiple recurrences of CDI, illustrates the difficulties in treating recurrent disease and the way it complicates the management of other medical conditions. Risk factors for CDI include antimicrobial use, hospital admission, advancing age, and severe underlying disease. A clinical diagnosis of CDI is usually confirmed by identifying C. difficile toxins in a stool sample. Evidence supports metronidazole, 500 mg every 6 hours for 10 to 14 days, as the treatment of choice for mild to moderately severe CDI. Oral vancomycin, 125 mg every 6 hours for 10 to 14 days, is recommended for severe CDI, for which it is more effective than metronidazole. Recurrent CDI occurs in more than 20% of patients when metronidazole or vancomycin treatment is discontinued. Few studies have evaluated treatment options for recurrent CDI, but a prolonged, tapering, and pulse-dosed regimen of oral vancomycin is commonly used. Careful attention to antimicrobial stewardship and infection control practices is essential to curb this nosocomial, iatrogenic disease.

### Initial therapy affects duration of diarrhoea in critically ill patients with Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) [^bb5048cb]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

CDI further harms critically ill patients by increasing 28-day mortality and in case of prolonged diarrhoea the length of their hospital stay. Appropriate therapy should be initiated promptly to shorten duration of diarrhoea. Our data point to the fact that metronidazole IV as a single agent might not represent an efficient initial monotherapy. Future studies should address the evaluation of combination therapy in critically ill patients with CDI. Since immunosuppressive therapy was identified as an independent predictor of increased 28-day mortality, patients should be carefully evaluated whether immunosuppressive therapy is indicated in case of concurrent CDI.

### Vancomycin versus metronidazole for nonsevereInfection: are the data adequate to change practice? [^6438abdf]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective: To compare oral metronidazole and vancomycin for the treatment of mild-to-moderate Clostridioides difficile infection (mmCDI). Data Sources: A MEDLINE literature search (inception to November 2018) was performed using the search terms metronidazole, vancomycin, and Clostridium/Clostridioides difficile. Additional references were identified from a review of literature citations. Study Selection and Data Extraction: All English-language clinical studies (interventional and observational), meta-analyses, and cost-effectiveness analyses comparing the efficacy of metronidazole and vancomycin for mmCDI were evaluated. Data Synthesis: Nine clinical studies, 5 meta-analyses, and 1 cost-effectiveness analysis provided comparative data for metronidazole and vancomycin for the treatment of mmCDI. Improved treatment response with vancomycin as compared with metronidazole in adults with mmCDI reached statistical significance in a few studies; albeit, most studies and pooled analyses have results that numerically favor vancomycin. Furthermore, the cost per case treated appears to be lower with vancomycin compared with metronidazole based on data from hospitalized patients. Relevance to Patient Care and Clinical Practice: Recent updates to national guidelines now give preference to vancomycin over metronidazole for mmCDI; however, this has been a source of controversy. This review provides an appraisal of direct and indirect comparisons of oral metronidazole and vancomycin for mmCDI, including recent literature published after the release of current guidelines. Conclusions: The available outcome data suggesting that vancomycin is more effective than metronidazole, combined with the more favorable pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerability profile of vancomycin, provide adequate clinical rationale for the preferential use of this agent for the treatment of mmCDI.

Severe CDI — metronidazole use and outcomes: Metronidazole should not be used for the treatment of severe CDI because it was shown to be inferior to vancomycin in multiple RCTs and cohort studies. Patients who received vancomycin only after failing metronidazole (≥ 48 hours) compared with those who received vancomycin at time of diagnosis had longer hospital stays, higher rates of acute kidney injury, and lower rates of cure, and in a large propensity-matched cohort of 3,130 patients with severe CDI, vancomycin compared with metronidazole reduced the 30-day all-cause mortality from 19.8% to 15.3% (P = 0.01).

### Fidaxomicin: the newest addition to the armamentarium against Clostridium difficile infections [^73701f69]. Clinical Therapeutics (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Fidaxomicin, a macrolide antibiotic, was the first medication for the management of Clostridium difficile infections (CDI) to be approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in more than 20 years.

Objective

This article reviews published literature on fidaxomicin for management of CDI, including its chemistry, spectrum of activity, pharmacokinetic properties, pharmacodynamics, therapeutic efficacy, adverse events, dosing, administration, and pharmacoeconomic considerations.

Methods

Pertinent English-language literature was reviewed through searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, and BIOSIS from 1975 through September 2011. Reference lists of identified publications and published abstracts from the Interscience Conference on Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy meetings were also reviewed. Search terms included, but were not limited to, fidaxomicin, difimicin, lipiarmycin, tiacumicin B, OPT-80, Clostridium spp, and diarrhea.

Results

A total of 79 publications were identified and 10 were excluded; 6 review articles and 4 abstracts that were later published as articles. Fidaxomicin's in vitro profile is favorable compared with oral metronidazole and vancomycin, with minimum inhibitory concentrations against C difficile that are 2 dilutions lower. From the 2 published Phase III trials, fidaxomicin was deemed to be noninferior in the treatment of mild to moderate CDI compared with oral vancomycin. Recurrence rates for all strains of CDI were lower with fidaxomicin than vancomycin. Adverse events associated with fidaxomicin were similar to placebo, with nausea and vomiting being the most common. Although no pharmacoeconomic studies have compared fidaxomicin with metronidazole or vancomycin, the current price exceeds $2500 (US) per treatment course.

Conclusions

Reports suggest that fidaxomicin is noninferior to oral vancomycin in the treatment of mild or moderate CDI, although no published comparisons with metronidazole exist to date. Additionally, fidaxomicin improved outcomes compared with oral vancomycin in terms of rates of relapse and recurrent CDI, and in patients who might require concomitant antibiotics. Prospective, randomized studies comparing fidaxomicin with metronidazole in the treatment of mild or moderate CDI, as well as against vancomycin for severe CDI, should be undertaken to clarify the exact role of fidaxomicin in clinical practice.

### Clostridium difficile – associated diarrhea [^ee4bd2a3]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Clostridium difficile infection is responsible for approximately 3 million cases of diarrhea and colitis annually in the United States. The mortality rate is 1 to 2.5 percent. Early diagnosis and prompt aggressive treatment are critical in managing C. difficile-associated diarrhea. Major predisposing factors for symptomatic C. difficile colitis include antibiotic therapy; advanced age; multiple, severe underlying diseases; and a faulty immune response to C. difficile toxins. The most common confirmatory study is an enzyme immunoassay for C. difficile toxins A and B. The test is easy to perform, and results are available in two to four hours. Specificity of the assay is high (93 to 100 percent), but sensitivity ranges from 63 to 99 percent. In severe cases, flexible sigmoidoscopy can provide an immediate diagnosis. Treatment of C. difficile-associated diarrhea includes discontinuation of the precipitating antibiotic (if possible) and the administration of metronidazole or vancomycin. Preventive measures include the judicious use of antibiotics, thorough hand washing between patient contacts, use of precautions when handling an infected patient or items in the patient's immediate environment, proper disinfection of objects, education of staff members, and isolation of the patient.

### Management of Clostridium difficile infection in inflammatory bowel disease: expert review from the clinical practice updates committee of the AGA institute [^a3e0d695]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2017). Medium credibility.

Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) — antibiotics and severity: According to treatment guidelines, a first and a second episode of mild–moderate CDI is treated with metronidazole 500 mg 3 times a day for 10 to 14 days (off-label), but failure rates have risen from 9.6% to as high as 22% to 26% and vancomycin was significantly more effective overall than metronidazole in randomized subgroup analysis. Vancomycin has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for CDI and is first-line for severe (monotherapy) and severe complicated (in combination with intravenous metronidazole), is superior to metronidazole for CDI, and is noninferior to fidaxomicin for initial clinical response; fidaxomicin trials showed fewer recurrences compared with vancomycin. In adults with IBD, vancomycin use versus metronidazole has been associated with a decreased colectomy rate, significantly fewer re-admissions, and an approximately 50% shorter length of hospital stay. In an open-label study of fidaxomicin in IBD (n = 21), all patients responded, with resolution of diarrhea (81%) or improvement but not resolution (19%), and recurrent CDI occurred in 19% with a median time to recurrence of 29 days. Severe CDI is defined either by an increased leukocyte count, increased creatinine level, or low albumin level, and when CDI complicates underlying IBD it is associated with prolonged hospitalization, need for surgery, escalation of IBD therapy, and increased mortality; the authors state that IBD can be considered as another CDI severity marker indicating the need for more aggressive management and, in their opinion, vancomycin or fidaxomicin, but not metronidazole, should be used for the management of CDI in IBD.

### Treatment of Clostridium difficile infections [^067a10f2]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Vancomycin and metronidazole were historically considered equivalent therapies for the management of Clostridium difficile infections (CDI); however, recent data confirm more favorable outcomes with vancomycin. Fidaxomicin is a narrow spectrum antibiotic that has an advantage in reducing recurrence rates compared with vancomycin, possibly owing to its sparing effect on normal colonic microbiota. Data are limited for guiding management of CDI recurrences, particularly multiple recurrences. Several empiric approaches to manage these cases are reviewed.

### ACG clinical guidelines: prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of Clostridioides difficile infections [^39acd8de]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection (rCDI) first recurrence — treatment recommendations and comparative efficacy are as follows: We suggest tapering/pulsed-dose vancomycin for patients experiencing a first recurrence after an initial course of fidaxomicin, vancomycin, or metronidazole (strong recommendation, low quality of evidence). We recommend fidaxomicin for patients experiencing a first recurrence after an initial course of vancomycin or metronidazole (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). rCDI is generally defined as the recurrence of diarrhea and a confirmatory positive test (NAAT or EIA) within 8 weeks after treatment of an initial episode of CDI. In subgroup analyses of two phase 3 trials, fidaxomicin was superior in preventing a second recurrence within 28 days (35.5% of patients treated with vancomycin and 19.7% of patients treated with fidaxomicin, P = 0.045). In older adults, extended‑pulsed fidaxomicin achieved sustained clinical cure 30 days post‑treatment in 124 (70%) of 177 vs 106 (59%) of 179 with vancomycin (P = 0.030). Vancomycin cleared C. difficile by end of therapy more often than metronidazole (89% vs 59%, respectively; P = 0.001). Based on efficacy and safety concerns, metronidazole should not be used to treat rCDI and metronidazole treatment should be limited to 1 course because of risk of neurotoxicity with prolonged or repeated use.

### Drugs for treating giardiasis [^123f35d2]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Giardiasis infection may be asymptomatic, or can cause diarrhoea (sometimes severe), weight loss, malabsorption, and, in children, failure to thrive. It is usually treated with metronidazole given three times daily for five to 10 days.

Objectives

To evaluate the relative effectiveness of alternative antibiotic regimens for treating adults or children with symptomatic giardiasis.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Infectious Disease Group Specialized Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (Issue 6 2012); MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS and the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform Search Portal (3 July 2012).

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCT) comparing metronidazole administered for five to 10 days with any of the following drugs: metronidazole (single dose), tinidazole, albendazole, mebendazole, and nitazoxanide. The primary outcomes were parasitological and clinical cure.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, performed the risk of bias assessment, and extracted data. We summarized data using risk ratios and mean differences and we presented the results in forest plots and performed meta-analyses where possible. We assessed heterogeneity using the Chi(2) test, I(2) statistic and visual inspection; and we explored this by using subgroup analyses. We assessed the quality of evidence by using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

We included 19 trials, involving 1817 participants, of which 1441 were children. Studies were generally small, with poor methods reporting. Most reported parasitological outcomes rather than clinical improvement. Ten trials, from India, Mexico, Peru, Iran, Cuba, and Turkey, compared albendazole (400 mg once daily for five to 10 days) with metronidazole (250 mg to 500 mg three times daily for five to 10 days). This once-daily regimen of albendazole is probably equivalent to metronidazole at achieving parasitological cure (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.03; 932 participants, 10 trials; moderate quality evidence), and improving symptoms (RR 0.98, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.93 to 1.04; 483 participants, five trials; moderate quality evidence), but the duration of follow-up was short (two to three weeks). Albendazole probably has fewer side effects than metronidazole (gastrointestinal side effects: RR 0.29, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.63; 717 participants, eight trials; moderate quality evidence; neurological side effects: RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.64; 453 participants, five trials; low quality evidence). Five trials from Turkey, Spain and the UK compared mebendazole (200 mg three times daily for five to 10 days) with metronidazole (5 mg/kg (or 250 mg) three times daily for five to 10 days). These trials were small in size, and at high risk of bias. Consequently, reliable conclusions on the relative effectiveness cannot be made (very low quality evidence). Five further trials, from Iran, Spain and Peru, have evaluated shortened regimens of tinidazole (single dose; 179 participants, three trials), metronidazole (single dose; 55 participants, one trial), and nitazoxanide (three days; 55 participants, one trial). Again, these trials were at high risk of bias and too small to reliably detect or exclude important differences (very low quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

Albendazole may be of similar effectiveness to metronidazole, may have fewer side effects, and has the advantage of a simplified regimen. Large, high quality trials, assessing clinical outcomes (such as diarrhoea) will help assess further alternatives.

### Outcome of metronidazole therapy for Clostridium difficile disease and correlation with a scoring system [^12906ad7]. The Journal of Infection (2007). Low credibility.

Objectives

To determine the response rate of Clostridium difficile disease (CDD) to treatment with metronidazole and assess a scoring system to predict response to treatment with metronidazole when applied at the time of CDD diagnosis.

Methods

Retrospective review of patients with CDD who received primary treatment with metronidazole. We defined success as diarrhea resolution within 6 days of therapy. A CDD score was defined prospectively using variables suggested to correlate with disease severity.

Results

Among 102 evaluable patients, 72 had a successful response (70.6%). Twenty-one of the remaining 30 patients eventually responded to metronidazole, but required longer treatment, leaving 9 'true failures'. The mean CDD score was higher among true failures (2.89 ± 1.4) than among all metronidazole responders (0.77 ± 1.0) (p < .0001). The score was greater than 2 in 67% of true failures and 2 or less in 94% of metronidazole responders. Leukocytosis and abnormal CT scan findings were individual factors associated with a higher risk of metronidazole failure.

Conclusions

Only 71% of CDD patients responded to metronidazole within 6 days, but the overall response rate was 91%. A CDD score greater than 2 was associated with metronidazole failure in 6 of 9 true failures. The CDD score will require prospective validation.

AGA clinical practice update — best practice advice for Clostridium difficile infection in inflammatory bowel disease states the following. Clinicians should test patients who present with a flare of underlying inflammatory bowel disease for Clostridium difficile infection. Clinicians should screen for recurrent C difficile infection if diarrhea or other symptoms of colitis persist or return after antibiotic treatment for C difficile infection. Clinicians should consider treating C difficile infection in inflammatory bowel disease patients with vancomycin instead of metronidazole. Clinicians strongly should consider hospitalization for close monitoring and aggressive management for inflammatory bowel disease patients with C difficile infection who have profuse diarrhea, severe abdominal pain, a markedly increased peripheral blood leukocyte count, or other evidence of sepsis. Clinicians may postpone escalation of steroids and other immunosuppression agents during acute C difficile infection until therapy for C difficile infection has been initiated, and the decision to withhold or continue immunosuppression in inflammatory bowel disease patients with C difficile infection should be individualized because there is insufficient existing robust literature on which to develop firm recommendations. Clinicians should consider referral for fecal microbiota transplantation to inflammatory bowel disease patients with recurrent C difficile infection.

### Clostridioides difficile infection evaluation and management in the emergency department [^397c6981]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI), characterized primarily by diffuse diarrhea in the setting of recent healthcare and antibiotic exposure, maintains significantly high rates of diagnosis in the U.S., even in the emergency department (ED). Recent updates in the literature concerning CDI should be considered for effective clinical practice in the ED setting.

Objective

This narrative review provides an evidence-based summary of current data for the ED-based evaluation and management of CDI.

Discussion

Substantial literature on the risk factors, diagnostic criteria, and treatment regimens have recently published concerning CDI. These studies include evaluation of risks associated with specific antibiotic classes, demonstrating that even single doses of antibiotics pose significant risk of CDI. Disproportional increases in elderly CDI rates show particular vulnerability in this population. Updated literature reveals presenting symptoms with wide ranges in rates of diarrhea, abdominal pain, fever, and nausea with vomiting. In some patients diarrhea may be altogether absent, clouding clinical suspicion. Classification primarily centers on a non-severe/severe division from the IDSA. Treatment has largely shifted away from metronidazole as a first-line antibiotic, instead focusing on oral vancomycin and fidaxomicin, even for an initial episode of CDI in an uncomplicated patient. Attention to hand hygiene and adherence to contact precautions are key to infection prevention.

Conclusions

CDI cause significant illness throughout the U.S. Successful CDI diagnosis and management in the ED require current knowledge of risk, presentation, diagnosis, and proper antibiotic treatment.

### Clostridioides difficile infection: update on management [^b0ae6c74]. American Family Physician (2020). Medium credibility.

Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of Clostridioides difficile infection have recently been updated. Risk factors include recent exposure to health care facilities or antibiotics, especially clindamycin. C. difficile infection is characterized by a wide range of symptoms, from mild or moderate diarrhea to severe disease with pseudomembranous colitis, colonic ileus, toxic megacolon, sepsis, or death. C. difficile infection should be considered in patients who are not taking laxatives and have three or more episodes of unexplained, unformed stools in 24 hours. Testing in these patients should start with enzyme immunoassays for glutamate dehydrogenase and toxins A and B or nucleic acid amplification testing. In children older than 12 months, testing is recommended only for those with prolonged diarrhea and risk factors. Treatment depends on whether the episode is an initial vs. recurrent infection and on the severity of the infection based on white blood cell count, serum creatinine level, and other clinical signs and symptoms. For an initial episode of nonsevere C. difficile infection, oral vancomycin or oral fidaxomicin is recommended. Metronidazole is no longer recommended as first-line therapy for adults. Fecal microbiota transplantation is a reasonable treatment option with high cure rates in patients who have had multiple recurrent episodes and have received appropriate antibiotic therapy for at least three of the episodes. Good antibiotic stewardship is a key strategy to decrease rates of C. difficile infection. In routine or endemic settings, hands should be cleaned with either soap and water or an alcohol-based product, but during outbreaks soap and water is superior. The Infectious Diseases Society of America does not recommend the use of probiotics for prevention of C. difficile infection.

### Decoding a cryptic mechanism of metronidazole resistance among globally disseminated fluoroquinolone-resistant Clostridioides difficile [^6db243da]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI), a leading cause of hospital-associated diarrhea, has attracted international attention due to worsening clinical outcomes resulting from the global spread of epidemic strains of PCR ribotype (RT) 027 –; RT027 belongs to phylogenetic Clade 2 (Supplementary Data 1 shows the relationship between ribotype and phylogenetic classifications based on genomes of strains; in this study, strains are classified based on their ribotype and/or phylogenetic clade, unless otherwise specified). These strains caused outbreaks of CDI across North America, UK, Europe and Latin America with an increased incidence of severe illness, morbidity, and mortality. These global outbreaks also demarcate the pandemic era of CDI. During this era metronidazole and vancomycin were the main two antibiotics used to treat CDI, until fidaxomicin was approved by the FDA in 2011. However, due to declining efficacy, metronidazole is no longer recommended as a first-line drug for adult CDI in the updated IDSA/SHEA and ESCMID CDI guidelines. This represents a significant shift in the treatment paradigm of CDI –, with metronidazole reserved as an intravenous therapy in combination with vancomycin for fulminant CDI. These changes in CDI therapeutics, due to declining metronidazole efficacy, warrant elucidation of the microbial genetic factors affecting this drug and the global CDI epidemiology. The microbial genetic determinants of metronidazole resistance are poorly understood.

Metronidazole was established as an antibiotic for CDI following clinical trials in the 1980s and 1990s, where it not only showed comparable clinical success rates to vancomycin but was much less expensive. However, over the last two decades it has become less effective, compared to vancomycin. This was originally seen in a randomized clinical trial, conducted between 1994 and 2002, where metronidazole demonstrated an 84% cure rate compared to 97% seen with vancomycin. In a second clinical study conducted between 2005 and 2007, vancomycin exhibited superior cure rates to metronidazole, 81.1% compared to 72.7%. These two studies reveal that metronidazole became less effective in the epidemic era. Indeed, metronidazole treatment failures in Quebec more than doubled from 9.6% in 1991–2002 to 25.7% in 2003–2004, which is also the region that reported the first outbreak of epidemic RT027. The reasons for the reduced clinical utility of metronidazole have been a longstanding mystery. One possibility is that increased use of metronidazole in response to rising rates of CDI imposed selection pressures that enabled the emergence and dissemination of drug-resistant C. difficile.

Management

The management of CDI is determined by the number and severity of episodes. Children who do not respond to targeted treatment within 5 days should be re-evaluated for other causes. There is currently insufficient evidence to support probiotics as an alternative to antimicrobial therapy for CDI treatment.

First Episode

For symptomatic children, initial management should include discontinuation of the inciting antibiotic, when possible, to limit further intestinal microbial disruption. Current antimicrobial therapies targeted against the initial CDI episode of mild or moderate severity include oral metronidazole and oral vancomycin (Table 2). Metronidazole, which has been a mainstay treatment of pediatric CDI, was removed as a recommended first line choice for adults in the 2017 IDSA and SHEA guidelines. Vancomycin and fidaxomicin are now recommended as preferred first line therapies in adults based on improved clinical cure rates and lower recurrence risk.– High quality data to support treatment guideline recommendation in children were lacking at the time, however postguideline shifts in prescribing practice with decreased use of metronidazole and increased use of oral vancomycin in children with CDI have been observed.

TABLE 2
Summary of Therapies for Children With Clostridioides difficile Infection^

A retrospective, comparative effectiveness study of 192 children hospitalized with nonsevere CDI has since shown that those treated with vancomycin had earlier resolution of symptoms (86.3%) compared with those treated with metronidazole (71.1%) by day 5, whereas recurrence was similar. The recent landmark SUNSHINE study represents the first clinical trial conducted in children with CDI. In this phase 3 trial, 142 children with CDI were age-stratified and randomized to receive either oral fidaxomicin or vancomycin for 10 days. Children had to have negative rotavirus testing results to be eligible, and children with inflammatory bowel disease were excluded. No difference in clinical response at the end of therapy was shown, however at 30 days after therapy, the rate of sustained response was higher with fidaxomcin (68%) compared with vancomycin (50%), with an adjusted treatment difference of 18.8% (95% confidence interval 1.5%–35.3%). Children under 2 years of age were included, so it is unclear if other etiologies contributed to diarrhea in younger participants. Regardless, based on these positive results, in 2020 the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) expanded approval of fidaxomicin for treatment of CDI to include children 6 months of age and older. These 2 studies open up new therapeutic options in children.

### Advances in the medical treatment of Clostridioides difficile infection [^210ffc86]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

Clostridioides difficile medical management has changed significantly over the past decade with emphasis on preventing recurrent infection. This review compares current guidelines on the treatment of initial, recurrent, fulminant, and pediatric C difficile infection (CDI) and evaluates the mechanisms and clinical use of available antibiotics for CDI. C difficile has complex resistance mechanisms to vancomycin, fidaxomicin, and metronidazole which may play a role in treatment outcomes. Antibiotics such as tigecycline and rifaximin as well as monoclonal antibodies against toxin B may play a role in adjunctive therapy. Additional therapies under development include new narrow therapeutic antibiotics.

Summary and conclusions for Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) — testing, treatment, hospitalization, and immunosuppression timing: Clinicians should test all patients who present with a flare of underlying IBD for CDI, and patients should be tested for recurrent CDI if diarrhea or other symptoms persist or return after antibiotic treatment. IBD patients with CDI should be treated with vancomycin instead of metronidazole. IBD patients with CDI who have profuse diarrhea, severe abdominal pain, a markedly increased peripheral blood leukocyte count, or other evidence of sepsis should be hospitalized for close monitoring and aggressive management. Clinicians may postpone escalation of steroids and other immunosuppression agents during acute C difficile infection until therapy has been established, but the decision to withhold or continue immunosuppression should be individualized. Fecal microbiota transplantation should be offered to patients with IBD with recurrent CDI.

One final, but important, consideration with regards to treatments of CDI, is that a therapy must gain access to the lumen of the colon to be effective. If a treatment does not concentrate in the colon, then it will be unable to treat CDI.

Metronidazole (Table 1) is an antimicrobial belonging to the nitroimidazole class of antibiotics. It blocks the helical DNA structure, causing strand breakage, inhibition of protein synthesis, and ultimately cell death in susceptible organisms. Metronidazole is unique in that it is the only antimicrobial we use to treat CDI that can be used intravenously. The reason for this is that metronidazole is released from the biliary tree into the fecal stream in an active form. Therefore, the intravenous form is released into the fecal stream and accesses the colon, as does the oral form. The oral form is also absorbed into systemic circulation and thought to be released at sites of inflammation such as the colon in the setting of CDI infection. Once inflammation is brought under control, metronidazole is thought to have a lower concentration; that is one theory explaining why recurrence rates are higher with this treatment. Side effects of metronidazole include a metallic taste in the mouth, nausea, headache, dizziness, and abdominal pains.

IDSA/SHEA 2017 pediatric CDI — second or greater episode of recurrent disease: For children with a second or greater episode of recurrent CDI, oral vancomycin is recommended over metronidazole (weak recommendation, low quality of evidence). The evidence base states there are no well-designed trials that examine the effectiveness of various treatment regimens in children with multiply recurrent CDI, and pediatric studies have not demonstrated conclusively that there is a difference in the risk of recurrence related to the therapeutic agent used to treat an initial episode.

Regarding medical management for Clostridioides difficile infection, more specifically with respect to antibiotic therapy, fulminant disease, IDSA/SHEA 2018 guidelines recommend to administer IV metronidazole 500 mg every 8 hours in addition to oral or rectal vancomycin, particularly in patients with ileus.

### Targeting parasite-produced macrophage migration inhibitory factor as an antivirulence strategy with antibiotic-antibody combination to reduce tissue damage [^829e0337]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Protozoan parasites represent a major threat to global public health, causing > 1 million deaths yearly. No effective vaccines have been developed to prevent disease from any of the protozoan parasites to date. Therefore, the management of infected patients continues to rely on treatment with antibiotics and supportive care. New strategies to fight such infections are urgently needed due to the emergence of multidrug-resistant pathogens that limit available treatment options. In addition, poor clinical outcomes are associated with severe infections, even when appropriate therapy is administered. For example, Entamoeba histolytica is a protozoan parasite that causes inflammatory diarrhea, termed amebic colitis, which is characterized by colonic inflammation and tissue damage. Entamoeba histolytica infects millions of people annually, making amebic colitis a leading cause of severe diarrhea worldwide, estimated to kill approximately 50 000–100 000 people each year. Severe forms of amebic colitis carry high fatality exceeding 50%, even despite treatment with the nitroimidazole antibiotics, such as metronidazole, which are the treatment choice. New therapeutic strategies are needed as metronidazole alone is sometimes not enough, and even drastic measures such as the surgical resection of the inflamed portion of colon may not prevent death.

IDSA/SHEA 2017 pediatric Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) — initial episode or first recurrence of nonsevere disease: Either metronidazole or vancomycin is recommended for the treatment of children with an initial episode or first recurrence of nonsevere CDI (weak recommendation, low quality of evidence). Evidence indicates there are no RCTs comparing the use of these agents in children, and reported outcomes include a prospective series of 82 children in which 56 received metronidazole and 6 (11%) had treatment failure, and a cohort of 69 community-acquired CDI cases showing treatment failure 18% for metronidazole and 0% for vancomycin without a statistically significant difference. A physician survey found that 100% had treated children with CDI, but only 41%–79% treated mild CDI in children with underlying comorbidities, and complications and mortality from CDI in children are uncommon regardless of severity or antibiotic choice. Safety notes include that oral vancomycin is not absorbed with a lower risk of adverse effects than metronidazole, but vancomycin exposure promotes carriage of vancomycin-resistant enterococci and available data suggest metronidazole use is also associated with this outcome.

Cardiovascular: Flattening of the T-wave may be seen in electrocardiographic tracings. Nervous System: The most serious adverse reactions reported in patients treated with metronidazole have been convulsive seizures, encephalopathy, aseptic meningitis, optic and peripheral neuropathy, the latter characterized mainly by numbness or paresthesia of an extremity. In addition, patients have reported syncope, vertigo, incoordination, ataxia, confusion, dysarthria, irritability, depression, weakness, and insomnia. Gastrointestinal: Abdominal discomfort, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, an unpleasant metallic taste, anorexia, epigastric distress, abdominal cramping, constipation, "furry" tongue, glossitis, stomatitis, pancreatitis, and modification of taste of alcoholic beverages. Genitourinary: Overgrowth of Candida in the vagina, dyspareunia, decreased libido, proctitis.

Renal: Dysuria, cystitis, polyuria, incontinence, a sense of pelvic pressure, darkened urine. The intravaginal administration of a single 5 gram dose of VANDAZOLE results in relatively lower mean systemic exposure to metronidazole that is approximately 2% to 5% of that achieved following a 500 mg oral dose of metronidazole. The following drug interactions were reported for oral metronidazole. Use of oral metronidazole has been associated with a disulfiram-like reaction to alcohol. Alcoholic beverages and preparations containing ethanol or propylene glycol should not be consumed during and for at least three days after VANDAZOLE therapy.

Alternatively, a lactating patient may interrupt breastfeeding and choose to pump and discard breastmilk during treatment with VANDAZOLE and for 48 hours after the last dose and feed her infant previously stored human milk or formula. Data In a study of lactating women receiving oral metronidazole 600 mg or 1200 mg daily, mean maternal plasma concentrations were 5. 0 and
12. **5 mcg/mL, respectively, within 2 hours following administration; the milk**: maternal plasma ratio was approximately 1.

Multiply recurrent CDI in children — Evidence from adult studies supports the use of an extended course of oral vancomycin (tapered or pulse regimen), oral vancomycin followed by rifaximin, or fidaxomicin in patients with multiply recurrent CDI. For children with a second recurrence of CDI who have been treated exclusively with metronidazole, a conventional course of oral vancomycin should be considered, and for children with multiple recurrences of CDI despite conventional courses of metronidazole and oral vancomycin, an alternate therapeutic regimen should be used. Vancomycin, fidaxomicin, and rifaximin are not absorbed when orally administered; rifaximin has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of traveler's diarrhea in children ≥ 12 years of age, whereas fidaxomicin was not approved for use in patients < 18 years of age at the time of this writing. In contrast, repeated or prolonged exposure to metronidazole has been associated with neuropathies, and concerns have been voiced about the risk of resistance associated with the use of rifaximin.

### Impact of childhood nutritional status on pathogen prevalence and severity of acute diarrhea [^3cdab1ff]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2017). Low credibility.

In this analysis, children with acute malnutrition had a lower prevalence of Giardia recovery in their stools than better nourished children, although it should also be noted that accurate adjustment for age and socioeconomic status was not possible, as only a single child with acute malnutrition had Giardia. This result is at odds with previous studies that have found Giardia to be more or equally prevalent in stools of children with poor nutritional status. The role of Giardia as a cause of diarrhea is also unclear. Nonrandomized experimental studies in high-income countries have observed an association between Giardia infection and diarrhea, – and its role as a diarrheal pathogen has been reinforced by localized diarrhea epidemics attributed to the parasite across Europe and the United States. However, multiple case–control studies from low-income settings have recovered Giardia more frequently in asymptomatic controls than diarrhea cases. These studies, coupled with in vitro evidence, suggest that Giardia may protect against severe diarrhea by modulating the pro-inflammatory response to coinfection with another pathogen. – If this hypothesis is true, the higher prevalence of Giardia among better nourished could moderate the response to other enteric pathogens, leading to a decreased severity diarrhea when compared with children with less prevalent Giardia. Alternatively, antibiotic use, specifically with metronidazole, could have influenced these results. We observed an inverse relationship between MUAC and reported antibiotic use prior to presentation in our study. A recent publication reporting findings from 2,089 children in eight countries noted that metronidazole use in response to diarrheal episodes accounted for a substantial amount of the observed inverse association between Giardia and diarrhea.

IDSA/SHEA 2017 Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) — evidence summary for initial treatment shows vancomycin superiority to metronidazole and supports 10-day regimens. Cure was superior for all patients given oral vancomycin (97%) compared to metronidazole (84%; P < .006), and among 69 patients with severe disease vancomycin (97%) outperformed metronidazole (76%; P = 0.02); in a combined analysis metronidazole clinical response rates (72.7%) were also inferior to vancomycin (81.1%) (P = 0.02). Nearly all randomized trials have compared 10-day regimens of CDI treatment agents, and 10 days should be sufficient to resolve symptoms in most patients, though some patients may have delayed response to treatment, particularly those treated with metronidazole. Use of oral metronidazole, however, should be restricted to the initial episode of nonsevere CDI in cases where other therapies are contraindicated or not available, and treatment should be limited to one course due to case reports of neurotoxicity with prolonged or repeated use; when access barriers exist, compounding of the intravenous formulation of vancomycin for oral administration has been used as a less expensive alternative to the capsular form.

### Evolution of clinical guidelines for antimicrobial management ofinfection [^567108be]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

There are currently only two US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved treatments for CDI: vancomycin and fidaxomicin. Fidaxomicin was approved for use in adult patients with initial episode of CDI in 2011. Metronidazole has never received FDA approval and is used off label. With this basic understanding, this manuscript is designed to describe the evolution of the antimicrobial treatment guidelines in the US, including all global guidelines to compare and contrast the recommendations understanding the differences among these documents and how they have evolved over time. It is important to consider that, outside of the US, the impact of CDI and associated strains are seen differently and this will influence the recommendations made. The priority of this manuscript is to focus on the changes in these guideline documents over the prior decade.

### Infection in patients with inflammatory bowel disease [^0002fd77]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

The use of alternate antibiotics has been researched extensively, but no consensus has been reached. Nelson comprehensively reviewed twelve randomized, controlled trials (1157 participants) of antibiotic treatment for C. difficile associated diarrhea involving patients who had recently taken antibiotics for other infections. Eight antibiotics were studied, including vancomycin, metronidazole, fusidic acid, nitazoxanide, teicoplanin, rifampin, rifaximin and bacitracin. In paired comparisons, no single antibiotic was superior to others, though teicoplanin, a costly antibiotic of limited availability, showed in some trials a significant benefit over vancomycin and fusidic acid, and a trend towards benefit compared with metronidazole. The combination of metronidazole and rifampin had no advantage over metronidazole alone. Teicoplanin is not readily available but was somewhat better than vancomycin for bacteriologic cure. Bacitracin was less effective. Nitazoxamide has been shown in a prospective, randomized, double-blind study (N = 74) to be as effective as metronidazole in treating C. difficile colitis. Fidaxomicin is a bactericidal macrocyclic antibiotic that has been found to reduce C. difficile counts while, unlike vancomycin, maintaining Bacteriodes species, a major constituent of normal flora. A phase III trial in 128 subjects who had experienced a single prior C. difficile infection episode and had recurred within three months, showed fewer recurrences and higher global cure rates in comparison to fidaxomicin with vancomycin. It is as safe and as well tolerated as standard vancomycin treatment. The search for the ideal antibiotic regime continues, given that recurrence of C. difficile colitis after cessation of therapy is common, occurring in 15–30% of patients. One reason for this may be that the antibiotic treatment administered for C. difficile colitis does not permit the restoration of the normal bowel flora. Some patients have multiple recurrences. Among non-antibiotics, cholestyramine has been used with dubious results in patients that were unresponsive to antibiotics. The drastic step of total colectomy can only be considered in the context of life-saving surgery for unresponsive ulcerative colitis. Here it is important to operate before life-threatening metabolic changes occur, such as hypoalbuminemia and lactic acidosis, and before the leukocyte count exceeds 16,000.

### Identification of risk factors for the development of Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea following treatment of polymicrobial surgical infections [^ae7a816a]. Annals of Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To identify risk factors for Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD) in surgical patients following treatment of polymicrobial infections.

Summary Background Data

Infections among surgical patients are frequently anaerobic or mixed aerobic-anaerobic infections and are therefore subject to polymicrobial antibiotic coverage, including metronidazole. While multiple antibiotics are known to contribute to the development of CDAD, the role of preventive antibiotics is unproven.

Methods

An 11-year dataset of consecutive infections treated in surgical patients at a single hospital was reviewed. All intra-abdominal, surgical site, or skin/skin structure infections were identified. Each infection was evaluated for antibiotic coverage and subsequent CDAD. Antibiotic usage was assessed using chi analysis. A multiple logistic regression was used to identify independent predictors of CDAD.

Results

A total of 4178 intra-abdominal, surgical site, or skin/skin structure infections were identified. Of these infections, 98 were followed by CDAD. Only carbapenem use affected the incidence of CDAD: 3.5% of infections treated with a carbapenem were followed by CDAD, whereas only 2.1% of infections treated without carbapenems were followed by CDAD (P = 0.04). Metronidazole had no association with future CDAD. Only age and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) score were independently associated with CDAD by multiple logistic regression analysis.

Conclusions

Older patients with a high severity of illness are at greatest risk for developing CDAD following treatment of polymicrobial infections. No specific antibiotic class, including fluoroquinolones, is associated with an increased incidence of CDAD in this population. Although use of metronidazole in the treatment of polymicrobial infections is appropriate for anaerobic coverage, it does not reduce the risk of future CDAD.

### European society of clinical microbiology and infectious diseases: 2021 update on the treatment guidance document for Clostridioides difficile infection in adults [^71bfd261]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2021). Medium credibility.

Scope

In 2009, the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID) published the first treatment guidance document for Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI). This document was updated in 2014. The growing literature on CDI antimicrobial treatment and novel treatment approaches, such as faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) and toxin-binding monoclonal antibodies, prompted the ESCMID study group on C. difficile (ESGCD) to update the 2014 treatment guidance document for CDI in adults.

Methods and Questions

Key questions on CDI treatment were formulated by the guideline committee and included: What is the best treatment for initial, severe, severe-complicated, refractory, recurrent and multiple recurrent CDI? What is the best treatment when no oral therapy is possible? Can prognostic factors identify patients at risk for severe and recurrent CDI and is there a place for CDI prophylaxis? Outcome measures for treatment strategy were: clinical cure, recurrence and sustained cure. For studies on surgical interventions and severe-complicated CDI the outcome was mortality. Appraisal of available literature and drafting of recommendations was performed by the guideline drafting group. The total body of evidence for the recommendations on CDI treatment consists of the literature described in the previous guidelines, supplemented with a systematic literature search on randomized clinical trials and observational studies from 2012 and onwards. The Grades of Recommendation Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system was used to grade the strength of our recommendations and the quality of the evidence. The guideline committee was invited to comment on the recommendations. The guideline draft was sent to external experts and a patients' representative for review. Full ESCMID endorsement was obtained after a public consultation procedure.

Recommendations

Important changes compared with previous guideline include but are not limited to: metronidazole is no longer recommended for treatment of CDI when fidaxomicin or vancomycin are available, fidaxomicin is the preferred agent for treatment of initial CDI and the first recurrence of CDI when available and feasible, FMT or bezlotoxumab in addition to standard of care antibiotics (SoC) are preferred for treatment of a second or further recurrence of CDI, bezlotoxumab in addition to SoC is recommended for the first recurrence of CDI when fidaxomicin was used to manage the initial CDI episode, and bezlotoxumab is considered as an ancillary treatment to vancomycin for a CDI episode with high risk of recurrence when fidaxomicin is not available. Contrary to the previous guideline, in the current guideline emphasis is placed on risk for recurrence as a factor that determines treatment strategy for the individual patient, rather than the disease severity.

### Vancomycin, metronidazole, or tolevamer for Clostridium difficile infection: results from two multinational, randomized, controlled trials [^ec3d28ce]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is a common complication of antibiotic therapy that is treated with antibiotics, contributing to ongoing disruption of the colonic microbiota and CDI recurrence. Two multinational trials were conducted to compare the efficacy of tolevamer, a nonantibiotic, toxin-binding polymer, with vancomycin and metronidazole.

Methods

Patients with CDI were randomly assigned in a 2:1:1 ratio to oral tolevamer 9 g (loading dose) followed by 3 g every 8 hours for 14 days, vancomycin 125 mg every 6 hours for 10 days, or metronidazole 375 mg every 6 hours for 10 days. The primary endpoint was clinical success, defined as resolution of diarrhea and absence of severe abdominal discomfort for more than 2 consecutive days including day 10.

Results

In a pooled analysis, 563 patients received tolevamer, 289 received metronidazole, and 266 received vancomycin. Clinical success of tolevamer was inferior to both metronidazole and vancomycin (P < .001), and metronidazole was inferior to vancomycin (P = 0.02; 44.2% [n = 534], 72.7% [n = 278], and 81.1% [n = 259], respectively). Clinical success in patients with severe CDI who received metronidazole was 66.3% compared with vancomycin, which was 78.5%. (P = 0.059). A post-hoc multivariate analysis that excluded tolevamer found 3 factors that were strongly associated with clinical success: vancomycin treatment, treatment-naive status, and mild or moderate CDI severity. Adverse events were similar among the treatment groups.

Conclusions

Tolevamer was inferior to antibiotic treatment of CDI, and metronidazole was inferior to vancomycin. Trial Registration. clinicaltrials.gov NCT00106509 and NCT00196794.

CURRENT AND NEWLY APPROVED Clostridioides difficile INFECTION TREATMENTS

The vegetative bacteria can be successfully eliminated with antimicrobial therapy; however, the spores are highly resilient and can persist in the gut. The treatment of initial CDI with antimicrobial therapy can cause further disruptions to the microbiota, exacerbating the intestinal dysbiosis and potentially leading to the relapse of symptoms, known as CDI recurrence. CDI recurrence is defined as the onset of symptoms within 8 weeks of clinical cure from a previous episode and can occur in up to 20% of patients, with increasing frequency with each subsequent episode. This highlights the need to combine current antimicrobial regimes with microbiota-restorative therapies to re-establish colonization resistance of the commensal microbiota and reduce the likelihood of recurrent disease.

In line with current guidelines, CDI treatment options include fidaxomicin, vancomycin and metronidazole. Fidaxomicin is a narrow spectrum antibiotic that demonstrates superior preservation of the intestinal microbiota when compared to vancomycin and is associated with similar clinical cure rates and a lower risk of CDI recurrence. Fidaxomicin standard therapy (200 mg, 12 hourly for 10 days) is recommended as the first choice for treatment of the initial episode of nonsevere CDI, severe CDI and severe-complicated/refractory CDI. If fidaxomicin is not available, standard vancomycin therapy (125 mg, 6 hourly for 10 days) can be used as an alternative. Metronidazole is no longer recommended as a first line agent to treat CDI as the clinical cure rate demonstrated inferiority to vancomycin and was found to be a robust predictor of recurrence; however, despite recommendations, metronidazole remains a first line treatment option in many countries due to the cost and availability of alternatives.

Post-travel diarrhea — bacterial etiologies and Clostridioides difficile management in travelers' diarrhea (TD) note that while individual bacterial infections rarely cause persistent symptoms, organisms including Campylobacter spp. Shigella spp. Salmonella spp., and diarrheagenic Escherichia coli can cause persistent diarrhea, and a rare cause is Yersinia spp.; Clostridioides difficile–associated diarrhea can occur after or during antibiotic use, including malaria chemoprophylaxis, and the initial workup of persistent TD should always include C. difficile testing. The association between C. difficile and antimicrobial treatment is especially important to consider in patients with persistent TD that seems refractory to multiple courses of empiric antibiotic therapy. Healthcare professionals can prescribe oral vancomycin, fidaxomicin, or, less optimally, metronidazole, to treat C. difficile; recurrent cases may be treated with fecal microbiota transplantation by the oral route or as a retention enema, and the monoclonal antibody bezlotoxumab is also an option.

### Plasmid-mediated metronidazole resistance in Clostridioides difficile [^af758973]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Clostridioides difficile (Clostridium difficile) is a Gram-positive obligate anaerobe capable of causing Clostridioides difficile Infection (CDI) upon disruption of the normal intestinal microbiota. Although it is one of the major causes of nosocomial infectious diarrhea, community-acquired CDI is becoming more frequent. CDI infection poses a significant economic burden with an estimated cost at €3 billion per year in the European Union and impairs the quality of life in infected individuals. The incidence of CDI has increased over the last two decades with outbreaks caused by epidemic types such as PCR ribotype (RT) 027 (NAP1/BI). CDI is not restricted to this type, however, as infections caused by RT001, RT002, RT014/020, and RT078 are frequently reported in both Europe and the United States. Metronidazole is used for the treatment of mild-to-moderate infections and vancomycin for severe infections, though vancomycin is increasingly indicated as a general first-line treatment –. Fidaxomicin has recently also been approved for CDI treatment, but its use is limited by high costs. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is effective at treating recurrent CDI (rCDI) that is refractory to antimicrobial therapy. Reduced susceptibility and resistance to clinically used antimicrobials, including metronidazole, has been reported and this, combined with the intrinsic multiple drug-resistant nature of C. difficile, stresses the importance for the development of better diagnostics and new effective treatment modalities.

Clostridium difficile infection in adults — recurrent disease: Treat a first recurrence of CDI with oral vancomycin as a tapered and pulsed regimen rather than a second standard 10-day course of vancomycin (weak recommendation, low quality of evidence), OR treat a first recurrence of CDI with a 10-day course of fidaxomicin rather than a standard 10-day course of vancomycin (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence), OR treat a first recurrence of CDI with a standard 10-day course of vancomycin rather than a second course of metronidazole if metronidazole was used for the primary episode (weak recommendation, low quality of evidence). For patients with > 1 recurrence of CDI, antibiotic treatment options include oral vancomycin therapy using a tapered and pulsed regimen (weak recommendation, low quality of evidence), a standard course of oral vancomycin followed by rifaximin (weak recommendation, low quality of evidence), or fidaxomicin (weak recommendation, low quality of evidence). Fecal microbiota transplantation is recommended for patients with multiple recurrences of CDI who have failed appropriate antibiotic treatments (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). There are insufficient data at this time to recommend extending the length of anti–C. difficile treatment beyond the recommended treatment course or restarting an anti–C. difficile agent empirically for patients who require continued antibiotic therapy or who require retreatment shortly after completion of CDI treatment (no recommendation).

### A review of Clostridioides difficile infection and antibiotic-associated diarrhea [^cbbc2cd4]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Antibiotic-associated diarrhea and Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) occur frequently among adults. The pathophysiology of CDI is related to disruption of normal gut flora and risk factors include hospitalization, use of antibiotic therapy, and older age. Clinical manifestations can range from mild disease to toxic megacolon. Diagnosis is challenging and is based on a combination of clinical symptoms and diagnostic tests. Therapy includes cessation of antibiotics, or use of other agents depending on the severity of illness. Many novel agents for the treatment and prevention of CDI show promise and are under investigation.

Table 10.

Table 11.
IDSA and SHEA joint guidelines.

The 2017 IDSA/SHEA guidelines were a significant advancement forward for a number of reasons. This guidance included a significant shift away from metronidazole as a primary treatment of CDI. This shift away from metronidazole was fortified by a pivotal trial by Johnson et al. designed initially to consider an ion binder called Tolavemer that was thought of as a potential solitary therapy to treat CDI. Within two parallel studies conducted between 2005 and 2007, Tolevamer was compared with two control groups: metronidazole and vancomycin. Tolevamer did not perform well and was inferior to both metronidazole and vancomycin; however, using vancomycin (n = 266) and metronidazole (n = 289) as control groups provided prospective data comparing these treatments head-to-head. In the overall analysis, vancomycin was superior to metronidazole with regards to clinical success (81.1% versus 72.7%, p = 0.02). Therefore, as far back as 2005–2007, when the study was conducted, metronidazole was inferior to vancomycin and it was believed this gap in efficacy only widened with time. Therefore, within the 2017 IDSA/SHEA guidelines, metronidazole was largely removed from being a recommended treatment of an initial episode of CDI; essentially stating that it should be given only when either vancomycin or fidaxomicin are not available.
