## Question

Inpatient UTI treatment

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about inpatient UTI treatment. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about distinguishing true UTI from asymptomatic bacteriuria and confirming diagnostic criteria. Then, I should classify infection type and severity, including catheter-associated disease and sepsis risk. Next, I will address source control in catheterized patients, followed by empiric antimicrobial selection aligned with EAU and IDSA guidance. After that, I need to tailor therapy to patient-specific factors, determine duration using stewardship principles and emerging evidence, plan IV-to-oral transition and de-escalation, implement stewardship interventions, monitor for failure, and close with special population considerations and a concise summary algorithm.

> Let me first confirm whether we are dealing with a true UTI rather than asymptomatic bacteriuria, because treating bacteriuria without symptoms confers harm without benefit in most scenarios; pyuria alone does not distinguish CA-UTI from ASB, so I should not anchor on leukocytes in urine without compatible urinary symptoms, and I must obtain the urine culture before starting antibiotics to avoid obscuring microbiology and to guide de-escalation later [^115m8mLR] [^1141TKM5] [^1131y89g].

> Wait, let me verify the role of dipsticks and screening tests in hospitalized patients; the diagnostic accuracy of dipsticks to rule in UTI among inpatients is limited given the high prevalence of ASB and non-clean catch specimens, so I should not overinterpret dipstick positivity in the absence of symptoms or compatible signs, especially in older or frail patients where misdiagnosis is common [^116cdMGw] [^1131y89g].

> Next, I should classify the syndrome and severity; if there are systemic features such as fever or flank pain without shock, I would think acute pyelonephritis or cUTI, whereas hemodynamic instability indicates urosepsis and mandates immediate broad-spectrum IV therapy, while uncomplicated cystitis is rare among inpatients and CA-UTI requires both catheter exposure and compatible symptoms for diagnosis [^115RNX8k] [^117J5i6v] [^111xwYMR].

> I will now examine source control in catheterized patients; if the indwelling catheter has been in place longer than two weeks at symptom onset, I should replace it and culture from the freshly placed device, and if the catheter is no longer indicated, I should remove it to reduce recurrence risk, while maintaining closed drainage and using aseptic insertion techniques to prevent CA-UTI going forward [^116rxmtC] [^116gHYk5] [^117SVS32] [^116hQAt1].

> Let me think about empiric therapy for cUTI or acute pyelonephritis without sepsis; EAU 2025 supports amoxicillin plus an aminoglycoside, a second-generation cephalosporin plus an aminoglycoside, or an IV third-generation cephalosporin, while IDSA 2025 allows third- or fourth-generation cephalosporins or piperacillin/tazobactam, with cautious use of fluoroquinolones and avoidance of carbapenems up front unless high risk for resistant pathogens, and I should reconcile that EAU generally discourages empiric fluoroquinolones in many inpatient contexts [^115RNX8k] [^1136ebsk] [^114umbrL].

> Hold on, I should verify the empiric approach for catheter-associated UTI without severe illness; it largely mirrors cUTI regimens, but I should avoid empiric ciprofloxacin unless strict criteria are met such as low local resistance and outpatient oral management with severe beta-lactam allergy, and I need to predefine duration targets: 7 days with prompt response, 10–14 days if response is delayed, consider 5 days if using levofloxacin in non-severe CA-UTI, and use 3 days only in carefully selected women aged 65 or younger after catheter removal and without upper tract features [^1127QRf6] [^116gHYk5] [^116EXLaV] [^111SqEwW] [^116wYFkp].

> For patients with sepsis or urosepsis, I need to ensure early effective therapy within the first hour of recognition and then adapt based on cultures, because delays worsen outcomes and early de-escalation improves stewardship and safety; I should also ensure appropriate hemodynamic resuscitation and source control in parallel [^117J5i6v] [^115EMcVZ].

> I should double-check patient-specific factors that modify empiric choices; beta-lactam allergy, renal function for aminoglycosides, recent antibiotic exposures, local antibiograms, and especially the most recent prior urine culture can inform likely pathogens and susceptibility, with about 57% organism concordance at 4–8 weeks and nearly half even beyond 32 weeks, so using recent cultures can refine empirical therapy while awaiting current results [^111xwYMR] [^111M2WqX].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially read the IDSA 2025 language as "avoid antibiotics for complicated UTI if a resistant pathogen was previously isolated", but that cannot be correct; let me reconsider and clarify that the intent is to avoid choosing agents to which prior isolates were resistant and instead to leverage the most recent culture to guide safer empiric selection pending new cultures, not to withhold necessary antibiotics in cUTI or pyelonephritis [^111M2WqX].

> Next, I should review duration using stewardship principles; with prompt clinical improvement, 7 days is generally adequate for CA-UTI and many cUTI cases, while afebrile men did as well with 7 versus 14 days of ciprofloxacin or TMP-SMX, and delayed responses or ongoing device needs justify extending to 10–14 days, with biomarker-guided strategies such as PCT plus pyuria algorithms safely reducing antibiotic exposure by approximately 2–3 days in selected adults [^116RiYrc] [^116EXLaV] [^1171F9GK] [^1147KkDT].

> Let me verify when to step down to oral and de-escalate; once the patient is hemodynamically stable, afebrile for 48 hours, tolerating oral intake, and improving symptomatically, I should switch to the narrowest effective oral agent based on culture and susceptibility, because narrow-spectrum choices reduce harms and studies repeatedly show frequent overuse of broader agents at discharge, which stewardship can correct without compromising outcomes [^115fZRu5] [^116AgzG9] [^115t9T5V].

> I need to ensure robust stewardship interventions around these decisions; computerized prompts that present individualized MDRO risk and recommend standard-spectrum options can reduce empiric extended-spectrum days, institutional policies and education for catheter use and CAUTI prevention remain essential, and system-level shifts away from fluoroquinolones after FDA warnings have decreased their use and resistance, supporting caution with empiric fluoroquinolones in inpatient UTI care [^115t9T5V] [^115bL5j8] [^117QuuGa].

> Hold on, I should verify the 48–72 hour reassessment; at that point I should review clinical response, culture results, and renal function, and if the patient is not improving, I need to question the diagnosis, look for obstruction or abscess, reassess for non-urinary sources, and consider resistant bacteria or fungi, while also remembering that reporting and acting on colony counts below 100,000 CFU/mL can drive overtreatment, and that the absence of pyuria in a symptomatic catheterized patient should prompt alternative diagnoses [^116A5Pq6] [^111fBDCC].

> I will now examine special populations; in older hospitalized adults, overdiagnosis is common and I must apply stringent symptom criteria to avoid inappropriate antibiotics and their complications, in infants less than 60 days treatment failure is uncommon and not associated with short versus long initial IV durations, and in male patients the microbiology is more variable so empiric choices and durations should follow severity and culture guidance with careful follow-up [^1131y89g] [^115q7x87] [^112TE65A].

> But wait, what about prevention and device practices that affect recurrence; maintaining closed drainage, using aseptic insertion, implementing reminders or stop-orders to limit catheters, and removing unnecessary catheters reduce CA-UTI risk and downstream antibiotic exposure, supporting the emphasis on source control and prevention in parallel with treatment [^117SVS32] [^116hQAt1] [^11732Ydm] [^112Tdxtr].

> In summary, I need to ensure a disciplined algorithm: confirm symptomatic UTI and culture pre-antibiotics, perform source control for catheters, classify severity including sepsis, select guideline-concordant empiric therapy avoiding unnecessary fluoroquinolones and carbapenems, reassess at 48–72 hours to de-escalate and transition to oral, target 7 days when response is prompt while extending only if clinically indicated, and embed stewardship checks daily to minimize spectrum and duration while safeguarding outcomes [^111xwYMR] [^115RNX8k] [^116RiYrc] [^115t9T5V].

Inpatient UTI treatment requires **prompt empiric IV antibiotics** tailored to local resistance and patient risk [^1136ebsk], with **early de-escalation** to narrow-spectrum agents [^111xwYMR] once cultures are available [^115EMcVZ]. For severe or septic cases, initiate broad-spectrum coverage (e.g. piperacillin-tazobactam, carbapenem, or cefepime plus aminoglycoside) **within the first hour** [^117J5i6v]. For stable patients without sepsis, use a third-generation cephalosporin or piperacillin-tazobactam; avoid fluoroquinolones unless resistance is < 10% and no recent exposure [^115RNX8k] [^1136ebsk] [^1127QRf6] [^114umbrL]. Treat for 7–14 days based on response [^116EXLaV], **switch to oral therapy when stable**, and remove or replace catheters as indicated [^116rxmtC] [^116RiYrc]. Monitor for clinical improvement, adverse effects, and complications, and apply stewardship [^113wmtYX] to minimize resistance and C. difficile risk [^116cdMGw].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

- **Clinical assessment**: Evaluate for dysuria, frequency, urgency, suprapubic pain, flank pain [^115RNX8k], fever, chills, or altered mental status, especially in elderly or catheterized patients [^113kGXtE].

- **Laboratory tests**: Obtain urinalysis and urine culture before antibiotics [^1141TKM5]; in catheterized patients, collect from a freshly replaced catheter [^116gHYk5] or midstream voided specimen if the catheter is removed [^112qTX31].

- **Blood cultures**: Obtain in febrile, septic, or immunocompromised patients to detect bacteremia [^115RNX8k].

- **Imaging**: Use renal ultrasound or CT if obstruction, abscess, or structural abnormality is suspected [^115RNX8k].

---

## Empiric antibiotic therapy

Empiric therapy should be guided by **local resistance patterns**, patient-specific factors, and severity of illness [^1136ebsk].

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended empiric therapy** |
|-|-|
| Severe illness or sepsis | - Piperacillin-tazobactam [^115RNX8k] <br/> - Carbapenem (e.g. meropenem) <br/> - Cefepime plus aminoglycoside [^117J5i6v] |
| Stable, non-septic patients | Third-generation cephalosporin (e.g. ceftriaxone) [^115RNX8k] or piperacillin-tazobactam [^1136ebsk] |
| Fluoroquinolone use | Avoid empiric fluoroquinolones unless resistance < 10% [^1127QRf6] and no recent exposure [^114umbrL] |

---

## Duration of antibiotic therapy

- **Uncomplicated pyelonephritis**: 7–10 days [^115RNX8k].

- **Complicated UTI or delayed response**: 10–14 days [^116EXLaV].

- **Catheter-associated UTI**: 7 days if prompt response [^116RiYrc]; 10–14 days if delayed [^116EXLaV].

- **Short-course therapy**: Consider 5-day levofloxacin in non-severely ill CA-UTI [^111SqEwW].

---

## Transition from intravenous to oral therapy

Transition to oral therapy is appropriate once the patient is **clinically stable** [^1136ebsk], defined as at least 24 hours afebrile, hemodynamic stability, and improving symptoms. Select oral agents based on susceptibilities — typically fluoroquinolones, TMP-SMX, or beta-lactams. An **early switch** shortens hospital stay and reduces costs [^116AgzG9].

---

## Management of catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTI)

Management centers on catheter intervention and targeted antibiotics. Remove or replace catheters **in place for more than two weeks** at CA-UTI onset [^116rxmtC]. Base empiric therapy on local resistance and patient factors, and avoid fluoroquinolones when there has been recent use or resistance is high [^114umbrL]. Treat for 7 days with a prompt response, or 10–14 days if the response is delayed [^116RiYrc] [^116EXLaV].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Monitoring should include daily assessment of fever, symptoms, and hemodynamic status [^1136ebsk]. If there is no improvement within 48–72 hours, **repeat cultures** [^115RNX8k]. Monitor for antibiotic adverse reactions, Clostridioides difficile infection [^113wmtYX], and emerging resistance [^113w9t1z].

---

## Special considerations

In immunocompromised patients, use **broader empiric coverage** with close monitoring [^1136ebsk]. In pregnancy, **avoid fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides** and favor beta-lactams [^115RNX8k]. In pediatric patients, tailor therapy to age, weight, and organism susceptibilities [^112SQDPL].

---

## Prevention strategies

- **Catheter management**: Limit use, maintain closed systems [^117SVS32], and use aseptic technique [^116hQAt1].

- **Antimicrobial stewardship**: Use narrow-spectrum agents [^111xwYMR] and shortest effective duration [^1136ebsk].

- **Infection control**: Hand hygiene and standard precautions [^1169qNxC].

---

Inpatient UTI management centers on **timely empiric therapy** aligned with local resistance, rapid de-escalation, and appropriate duration, with catheter management and prevention strategies to reduce recurrence and resistance.

### Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI): Clinical guidelines for treatment and management [^1136ebsk]. IDSA (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for acute pyelonephritis, more specifically with respect to empiric antibiotics, the IDSA 2025 guidelines recommend considering the administration of a third- or fourth-generation cephalosporin, piperacillin/tazobactam, or a fluoroquinolone for the initial management of patients with suspected complicated UTI without sepsis, using the four-step assessment. This is preferred over carbapenems and newer agents such as novel β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitors, cefiderocol, plazomicin, or older aminoglycosides.

Recognize that other agents, such as TMP/SMX, amoxicillin/clavulanate, and first- or second-generation cephalosporins, are less well studied. However, they may be appropriate in select settings or situations for empiric oral treatment of complicated UTI.

### Diagnosis and management of urinary tract infection in hospitalized older people [^1131y89g]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2009). Low credibility.

To compare the diagnosis and management of urinary tract infection (UTI) in hospitalized older people using clinical criteria and therapeutic guidelines, a retrospective case series of emergency hospital admissions was conducted over an 18-month period. The study took place in an acute general hospital in northwest England.

Two hundred sixty-five patients aged 75 and older were diagnosed with UTI at hospital discharge. Data were collected relating to age, sex, presenting complaint, admission and discharge destinations, background comorbidities and medications, investigations performed, treatment given, length of hospital stay, and complications through chart review.

Of the 265 patients (mean age 85.4), overdiagnosis of UTI was common, with 43.4% of patients not meeting the criteria. Only 32.1% of patients overall had any urinary tract symptoms (48.7% in the UTI group). Of the non-UTI group, 12 (10.4%) had urinary tract symptoms with a negative urine culture, 43 (37.4%) had asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB), and 60 (52.2%) had neither urinary tract symptoms nor bacteriuria. Treatment given varied greatly. The mortality rate was 6.0%, and the average length of stay was 29.9 days (median 17.0, range 1–192). Complications were frequent, including Clostridium difficile diarrhea (8%), falls (4%), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection (3%), and fractures (2%).

The conclusion drawn from this study suggests that more reliable criteria are needed to aid the diagnosis of UTI in hospitalized older people. Better adherence to clinical management guidelines may improve outcomes.

### Strategies to prevent catheter-associated urinary tract infections in acute-care hospitals: 2022 update [^1169qNxC]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2023). High credibility.

This document was developed following the process outlined in the Handbook for SHEA-Sponsored Guidelines and Expert Guidance Documents. No guideline or expert guidance document can anticipate all clinical situations, and this document is not meant to be a substitute for individual clinical judgment by qualified professionals. It focuses on the prevention of catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs) in acute-care hospitals. The strategies highlighted may or may not be applicable to other healthcare settings, such as ambulatory settings or long-term or postacute-care facilities. Furthermore, there may be differences in healthcare environments within the hospital, such as acute-care wards versus intensive care units versus perioperative spaces, that may affect the feasibility of specific recommendations, which should be considered by stakeholders implementing these strategies.

This document is based on a synthesis of evidence, theoretical rationale, practical considerations, writing group consensus, and consideration of potential harm, where applicable.

### Diagnostic accuracy of dipsticks for urinary tract infections in acutely hospitalised patients: a prospective population-based observational cohort study [^116cdMGw]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

Urinary dipsticks are often used to guide the need for urine cultures and empirical antibiotics in patients with suspected urinary tract infections (UTIs), which are a leading cause of antibiotic treatment. Guidelines by Public Health England as well as the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence do not recommend dipsticks for the diagnosis of UTI, except in females below 65 years of age with mild to moderate symptoms. This consistency is observed with previous studies that found dipsticks to be moderately effective for ruling out UTI using clean midstream urine samples in premenopausal women outside a hospital setting, whereas their diagnostic accuracy among inpatients remains uncertain.

Nonetheless, the clinical use of dipsticks has expanded to rule in UTI in other patient groups, including elderly and hospitalized individuals with suspected UTI, severe infection, or an unclear clinical presentation. Importantly, urine is rarely obtained as clean midstream samples in these patient populations, and the prevalence of asymptomatic bacteriuria is high, ranging from 15% to 50%. This may lead to incorrect antibiotic treatment with associated risks of side effects and toxicity, Clostridioides difficile enterocolitis, and antibiotic resistance. Equally important is the potential delay in time to correct diagnosis attributable to fixation on an erroneous assumption of UTI, especially in elderly frail patients.

This study aimed to examine the added diagnostic accuracy of dipsticks to a symptom-driven approach at admission and associated management among acute inpatients.

### Diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of catheter-associated urinary tract infection in adults: 2009 international clinical practice guidelines from the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^115bL5j8]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2010). High credibility.

Regarding quality improvement for catheter-associated urinary tract infection, more specifically with respect to infection prevention, the IDSA 2010 guidelines recommend ensuring that hospitals and long-term care facilities develop, maintain, and promulgate policies and procedures. These should cover recommended catheter insertion indications, insertion and maintenance techniques, discontinuation strategies, and replacement indications. Additionally, the guidelines emphasize the necessity for education and training of staff relevant to these policies and procedures.

### Improving antibiotic prescribing for children with urinary tract infection in emergency and urgent care settings [^1161TjC9]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2020). Low credibility.

Children with urinary tract infection (UTI) are often diagnosed in emergency and urgent care settings and are increasingly unnecessarily treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics. This study evaluated the effect of a quality improvement intervention on empiric antibiotic prescribing for the treatment of uncomplicated UTI in children.

- **Methods**: A local clinical pathway for uncomplicated UTI, introduced in June 2010, recommended empiric treatment with cephalexin, a narrow-spectrum (first-generation) cephalosporin antibiotic. A retrospective quasi-experimental study was conducted on pediatric patients older than 1 month presenting to emergency and urgent care settings from January 1, 2009, to December 31, 2014, with uncomplicated UTI. Hospitalized patients and those with chronic conditions or urogenital abnormalities were excluded. Control charts and interrupted time-series analysis were used to analyze the primary outcome of narrow-spectrum antibiotic prescribing rates and the balancing measures of 72-hour revisits, resistant bacterial isolates, and subsequent inpatient admissions for UTI.

- **Results**: A total of 2134 patients were included. There was an immediate and sustained significant increase in cephalexin prescribing before (19.2%) versus after (79.6%) pathway implementation, and a significant decline in oral third-generation cephalosporin (cefixime) prescribing from 50.3% to 4.0%. There was no significant increase in 72-hour revisits, resistant bacterial isolates, or inpatient admissions for UTI.

- **Conclusions**: A clinical pathway produced a significant and sustained improvement in prescribing practices for children with uncomplicated UTI without increasing adverse events.

### Antibiotic overprescription for "urinary tract infections" is associated with poor diagnostic stewardship and low adherence to guidelines [^116DjuoS]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2025). Low credibility.

All consecutive patients bearing an isolated diagnostic code for UTI/cystitis within a single healthcare system during July 2019 were identified by the ICD-10 diagnostic code (Appendix SA). The healthcare system utilized was a large tertiary medical center in a major metropolitan city with high patient volumes. July 2019 was selected to avoid any alterations in treatment delivery resulting from the coronavirus pandemic. Patients demonstrating clinical signs or hemodynamic features of bacteremia, positive blood cultures, medical comorbidities associated with complicated UTI (e.g. indwelling catheter, recent urologic surgery, pregnancy, immunodeficiency, or transplant), or those admitted for inpatient care were excluded, resulting in a cohort of 909 patients.

- **Data collection**: Manual chart review was utilized to extract demographic (e.g. age, gender), clinical (e.g. symptoms), and microbial (e.g. features of microscopic urinalysis, urine microbiological testing) data from patients who met inclusion criteria. We also catalogued antibiotic treatments used, alternative diagnoses explored, and urine culture and susceptibility results. Symptoms were designated as "acute" if arising 28 days before presentation. The presence of "UTI symptoms", specified by the American Urological Association and expert consensus, was defined as either dysuria or hematuria with at least one additional urinary symptom, including urinary urgency, urinary frequency, worsening incontinence, or suprapubic pressure.

Regarding specific circumstances for catheter-associated urinary tract infection, more specifically with respect to patients with asymptomatic bacteriuria, IDSA 2010 guidelines recommend diagnosing CA-ASB in male patients with:

- **Condom catheter**: Use a condom catheter accompanied by the absence of symptoms or signs compatible with UTI and growth ≥ 10⁵ CFU/mL of ≥ 1 bacterial species in a single urine specimen from a freshly applied condom catheter.

### Appropriate antibiotic use for patients with urinary tract infections reduces length of hospital stay [^116AgzG9]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

To define appropriate antibiotic use for patients with a complicated urinary tract infection (UTI), we developed in a previous study a key set of four valid, guideline-based quality indicators (QIs). In the study, we evaluated the association between appropriate antibiotic use for patients with a complicated UTI, as defined by these QIs, and length of hospital stay (LOS).

- **Methods**: A retrospective, observational multicenter study included 1,252 patients with a complicated UTI, hospitalized at internal medicine and urology departments of 19 university and non-university Dutch hospitals. Data from the patients' medical charts were used to calculate QI performance scores. Multilevel mixed-model analyses were performed to relate LOS to QI performance (appropriate use or not). We controlled for the potential confounders: sex, age, (urological) comorbidity, febrile UTI, and intensive care unit admission < 24 hours.

- **Results**: Prescribing therapy in accordance with local hospital guidelines was associated with a shorter LOS (7.3 days vs. 8.7 days; p = 0.02), as was early intravenous-oral switching (4.8 days vs. 9.1 days; P < .001). There was an inverse relationship between the proportion of appropriate use in a patient (QI sum score/number of applicable QIs) and LOS (9.3 days for lower tertile vs. 7.2 days for upper tertile; overall P < .05).

- **Conclusions**: Appropriate antibiotic use in patients with a complicated UTI seems to reduce length of hospital stay and therefore favors patient outcomes and healthcare costs. In particular, adherence to the total set of QIs showed a significant impact.

### CDC grand rounds: Getting smart about antibiotics [^113wmtYX]. MMWR Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2015). Low credibility.

Inappropriate antibiotic use is not limited to the outpatient setting. A recent evaluation of prescribing for inpatients in two specific scenarios (urinary tract infections in patients without indwelling catheters and treatment with intravenous vancomycin) identified that antibiotic use could have been improved in 37% of cases. The frequency of antibiotic prescribing among inpatients varies considerably among hospitals. A recent study of 19 hospitals that had completed data validation and submitted antibiotic use data from one or more patient care settings found threefold differences in usage rates among 26 medical/surgical wards.

Visits for acute respiratory tract infections lead to more inappropriate antibiotic prescribing than visits for any other group of diagnoses. For example, antibiotic treatment for acute uncomplicated bronchitis is not recommended. Despite decades-long, widespread efforts to curb antibiotic prescribing, in 2010, 71% of all outpatient visits for this condition resulted in an antibiotic prescription. Similarly, overprescribing for pharyngitis is common. Only 5%–10% of pharyngitis cases among adults are caused by group A Streptococcus, for which antibiotic treatment is recommended, yet antibiotics are prescribed for approximately 60% of ambulatory care visits for adult pharyngitis. Outpatient antibiotic prescribing for children with acute respiratory tract infections has been decreasing since the mid- to late-1990s, but the rate of decline has slowed and might have reached a plateau. Several factors have been hypothesized to have contributed to this trend.

### Procalcitonin and pyuria-based algorithm reduces antibiotic use in urinary tract infections: a randomized controlled trial [^1147KkDT]. BMC Medicine (2015). High credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common drivers of antibiotic use. The minimal effective duration of antibiotic therapy for UTIs is unknown, but any reduction is important to diminish selection pressure for antibiotic resistance, costs, and drug-related side-effects. The aim of this study was to investigate whether an algorithm based on procalcitonin (PCT) and quantitative pyuria reduces antibiotic exposure.

- **Methods**: From April 2012 to March 2014, we conducted a factorial design randomized controlled open-label trial. Immunocompetent adults with community-acquired non-catheter-related UTI were enrolled in the emergency department of a tertiary-care 600-bed hospital in northwestern Switzerland. Clinical presentation was used to guide initiation and duration of antibiotic therapy according to guidelines (control group) or with a PCT-pyuria-based algorithm (PCT-pyuria group). The primary endpoint was overall antibiotic exposure within 90 days. Secondary endpoints included duration of the initial antibiotic therapy, persistent infection 7 days after the end of therapy and 30 days after enrollment, recurrence, and rehospitalizations within 90 days.

- **Results**: Overall, 394 patients were screened, 228 met predefined exclusion criteria, 30 declined to participate, and 11 were not eligible. Of these, 125 (76% women) were enrolled in the intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis and 96 patients with microbiologically confirmed UTI constituted the per protocol group. Among the enrolled, 84 of 125 (67%) patients had a febrile UTI, 28 (22%) had bacteremia, 5 (4%) died, and 3 (2%) were lost to follow-up.

### Optimal antibiotics at hospital discharge for children with urinary tract infection [^115fZRu5]. Hospital Pediatrics (2020). Low credibility.

Antibiotic stewardship at hospital discharge is an area of need. We assessed the rate of optimal antibiotic prescriptions at hospital discharge based on urine culture and susceptibility data for children diagnosed with a urinary tract infection (UTI).

- **Methods**: We conducted a retrospective study of patients ≤ 18 years of age who were admitted to a general pediatrics service at a freestanding children's hospital during 2017 with a diagnosis of UTI and received an antibiotic prescription at discharge. Optimal antibiotic at hospital discharge was determined by evaluating if the cultured urinary pathogen was susceptible to the prescribed antibiotic and if the antibiotic was the narrowest-spectrum option available. Secondary objectives included assessment of antibiotic dosing accuracy and description of antibiotic treatment duration.

- **Results**: A total of 78 cases were included. Sixty-eight (83%) cases were caused by cefazolin-susceptible Escherichia coli and Klebsiella species. Thirty-one (40%) cases had a discharge antibiotic prescription that was determined to be optimal. Of the 47 (60%) cases that were suboptimal, 44 (94%) were considered to be excessively broad spectrum. In 3 (6%) cases, the causative organism was nonsusceptible to the prescribed antibiotic. Ten (13%) discharge antibiotic prescriptions had inaccurate dosing and/or frequency.

- **Conclusions**: Missed opportunities for narrow-spectrum antibiotic selection at hospital discharge for pediatric UTIs frequently occurred. In particular, higher-generation cephalosporins and c…

### Antibiotic overprescription for "urinary tract infections" is associated with poor diagnostic stewardship and low adherence to guidelines [^111ag7A6]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2025). Low credibility.

With nearly half of women experiencing a urinary tract infection (UTI) in their lifetime, these infections are one of the leading reasons for antibiotic prescriptions in the United States and worldwide. Despite their clinical ubiquity, physicians exhibit significant variation in their approaches to the workup and treatment of uncomplicated UTIs, which may not always follow clinical practice guidelines. The use of unvalidated approaches to the management of UTIs may lead to inaccurate diagnoses and inappropriate antibiotic treatments; prior studies demonstrate that 50%–70% of antibiotic prescriptions for UTIs may be inappropriate, contributing to worsening global rates of antibiotic resistance.

Treatment guidelines from the American Urological Society (AUA), Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA), and American Geriatrics Society (AGS) agree that UTI diagnosis should be based on clinical symptomatology of urinary symptoms (e.g. dysuria, hematuria, urinary frequency, new incontinence in the absence of vaginal symptoms) associated with culture-proven bacteriuria with a bacterial uropathogen. Rates of asymptomatic bacteriuria range from 1% to 5% in premenopausal women to 16% in older women in the community, and as high as 50% in older women in long-term care facilities, demonstrating why appropriate clinical symptoms are needed to diagnose a UTI.

Prior studies have shown that among patients diagnosed with a UTI in the emergency room (ER), only 32% of adults and 17% of the oldest adults have urinary symptoms, demonstrating poor adherence to clinical guidelines.

### Stewardship prompts to improve antibiotic selection for urinary tract infection: The INSPIRE randomized clinical trial [^115t9T5V]. JAMA (2024). High credibility.

- **Importance**: Urinary tract infection (UTI) is the second most common infection leading to hospitalization and is often associated with gram-negative multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs). Clinicians overuse extended-spectrum antibiotics, although most patients are at low risk for MDRO infection. Safe strategies to limit overuse of empiric antibiotics are needed.

- **Objective**: To evaluate whether computerized provider order entry (CPOE) prompts providing patient- and pathogen-specific MDRO risk estimates could reduce use of empiric extended-spectrum antibiotics for treatment of UTI.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: A cluster-randomized trial was conducted in 59 US community hospitals. It compared the effect of a CPOE stewardship bundle, which included education, feedback, and real-time and risk-based CPOE prompts (29 hospitals), versus routine stewardship (30 hospitals) on antibiotic selection during the first 3 hospital days (empiric period) in noncritically ill adults (≥ 18 years) hospitalized with UTI. The study consisted of an 18-month baseline period (April 1, 2017-September 30, 2018) and a 15-month intervention period (April 1, 2019-June 30, 2020).

- **Interventions**: CPOE prompts recommended empiric standard-spectrum antibiotics in patients ordered to receive extended-spectrum antibiotics who had a low estimated absolute risk (< 10%) of MDRO UTI, coupled with feedback and education.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: The primary outcome was empiric (first 3 days of hospitalization) extended-spectrum antibiotic days of therapy. Secondary outcomes included empiric vancomycin and antipseudomonal days of therapy. Safety outcomes involved days to in…

### Importance of urinary tract infection to antibiotic use among hospitalized patients [^116CrwHV]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2009). Low credibility.

Many patients with asymptomatic bacteriuria receive extended courses of broad-spectrum antibiotics. Antibiotic use was analyzed in patients admitted to the hospital with urinary tract infection. Strategies to optimize antibiotic use for such patients are discussed and include implementing a process whereby a urine culture is automatically performed if a urinalysis result suggests infection.

### A decision algorithm to promote outpatient antimicrobial stewardship for uncomplicated urinary tract infection [^111RMPhH]. Science Translational Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Antibiotic resistance is a major cause of treatment failure and leads to increased use of broad-spectrum agents, which begets further resistance. This vicious cycle is epitomized by uncomplicated urinary tract infection (UTI), which affects one in two women during their lifetime and is associated with increasing antibiotic resistance and high rates of prescription for broad-spectrum second-line agents. To address this, we developed machine learning models to predict antibiotic susceptibility using electronic health record data and built a decision algorithm for recommending the narrowest possible antibiotic to which a specimen is susceptible.

When applied to a test cohort of 3,629 patients presenting between 2014 and 2016, the algorithm achieved a 67% reduction in the use of second-line antibiotics relative to clinicians. At the same time, it reduced inappropriate antibiotic therapy, defined as the choice of a treatment to which a specimen is resistant, by 18% relative to clinicians. For specimens where clinicians chose a second-line drug but the algorithm chose a first-line drug, 92% (1,066 of 1,157) of decisions ended up being susceptible to the first-line drug. When clinicians chose an inappropriate first-line drug, the algorithm chose an appropriate first-line drug 47% (183 of 392) of the time.

Our machine learning decision algorithm provides antibiotic stewardship for a common infectious syndrome by maximizing reductions in broad-spectrum antibiotic use while maintaining optimal treatment outcomes. Further work is necessary to improve generalizability by training models in more diverse settings.

### A comparison of short versus long course intravenous antibiotics when treating urinary tract infection in infants < 60 days of age [^115q7x87]. Clinical Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are a common reason for hospitalization in infants younger than 60 days, and the optimal approach to intravenous (IV) antibiotic therapy upon UTI diagnosis in this cohort is unknown. We determined whether there was an association between IV antibiotic therapy duration (long [> 3 days] vs. short [≤ 3 days]) and treatment failure via a retrospective review of infants with confirmed UTIs receiving IV antibiotics at a tertiary referral center. A total of 403 infants were included; 39% were treated with ampicillin and cefotaxime, and 34% with ampicillin and gentamycin or tobramycin. The median IV antibiotic duration was 5 (interquartile range: 3–10) days, and 5% of patients experienced treatment failure. The treatment failure rate was similar in both short- and long-course IV antibiotic groups (P > .05), and there was no significant association between treatment duration and failure. We conclude that treatment failure for infants hospitalized with UTI is uncommon and not associated with IV antibiotic duration.

Regarding the medical management of acute pyelonephritis, specifically concerning empiric antibiotic selection, the IDSA 2025 guidelines recommend avoiding antibiotics for patients with complicated UTIs, including acute pyelonephritis, if a resistant pathogen has been previously isolated from the urine. It is advised to use more recent urine cultures as a better guide than relying on older urine cultures.

### The epidemiology of urinary tract infection [^113KDEcE]. Nature Reviews Urology (2010). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are among the most common bacterial infections acquired in both community and hospital settings. In individuals without anatomical or functional abnormalities, UTIs are generally self-limiting but have a propensity to recur. Uropathogens possess specialized characteristics, such as the production of adhesins, siderophores, and toxins, which enable them to colonize and invade the urinary tract. These pathogens are transmitted between individuals both through person-to-person contact and potentially via food or water.

Although UTIs are generally self-limiting, treatment with antibiotics leads to a more rapid resolution of symptoms and is more likely to clear bacteriuria. However, antibiotic treatment also selects for resistant uropathogens and commensal bacteria, adversely affecting gut and vaginal microbiota. As uropathogens are increasingly becoming resistant to currently available antibiotics, it may be time to explore alternative strategies for managing UTIs.

### Urinary tract infection in male patients: Challenges in management [^112TE65A]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2024). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections in male patients share many of the management principles used in the treatment of female patients. This includes the need to accurately define the clinical syndrome, choose empirical therapy based on the severity of illness and potential for antimicrobial resistance, and consider the necessity for source control in severely ill patients. The microbiology of the causative organisms is more unpredictable compared to female patients, and data to inform treatment decisions from clinical trials specific to male patients are relatively scarce.

### A comparison of inpatient versus outpatient resistance patterns of pediatric urinary tract infection [^1164Tin1]. The Journal of Urology (2014). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study is to compare antibiotic resistance patterns for urinary tract infections between outpatients and inpatients on a national level. Prior single-center studies indicated that antibiotic resistance patterns differ between these two groups.

- **Materials and methods**: We examined outpatient and inpatient urinary isolates from children younger than 18 years using The Surveillance Network (Eurofins Scientific, Luxembourg, Luxembourg), a database of antibiotic susceptibility results, and patient demographic data from 195 American hospitals. We determined the prevalence and antibiotic resistance patterns of the six most common uropathogens: Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterococcus. Differences in uropathogen prevalence and resistance patterns for outpatient and inpatient isolates were compared using chi-square analysis.

- **Results**: We identified 25,418 outpatient (86% female) and 5,560 inpatient (63% female) urinary isolates. Escherichia coli was the most common uropathogen overall, but its prevalence varied by gender and visit setting. It accounted for 79% of uropathogens overall for outpatient isolates, including 83% of females and 50% of males, compared to 54% for overall inpatient isolates, including 64% of females and 37% of males (p < 0.001). Uropathogen resistance to many antibiotics was lower in the outpatient versus inpatient setting, including trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole at 24% vs. 30% and cephalothin at 16% vs. 22% for E. coli (each p < 0.001), cephalothin 7% vs. 14% for Klebsiella (p = 0.03), and ceftriaxone…

### Poor clinical outcomes associated with suboptimal antibiotic treatment among older long-term care facility residents with urinary tract infection: a retrospective cohort study [^116bp6GG]. BMC Geriatrics (2021). Low credibility.

Antibiotic resistance poses one of the most urgent and widespread threats to public health and is driven by antibiotic use. Antibiotic use is highly prevalent in long-term care facilities (LTCFs). Antibiotics are frequently used in older residents for many reasons, including their higher risk of infection due to immunosuppression, malnutrition, dehydration, presence of multiple comorbidities, and functional impairment. Several other issues, such as diagnostic uncertainty, the atypical and subtle presentation of common infections, and the frequency of colonization with antibiotic-resistant pathogens, also contribute to antibiotic use in this population. Approximately 10% of residents are on at least one antibiotic at any given time, and between 50% and 75% of residents receive an antibiotic over the course of a year. Up to 75% of antibiotic treatment in LTCFs may be inappropriate, putting already vulnerable residents at risk for unintended consequences of antibiotic use, including selection for colonization or infection with resistant organisms, Clostridioides difficile, antibiotic allergies, and other adverse drug effects and toxicities.

- **Urinary tract infection as a common driver**: The most common driver of antibiotic use and reason for inappropriate antibiotic use in LTCFs is urinary tract infection (UTI). A study, which included one-day point prevalence surveys from nine nursing homes in four states, demonstrated that one in three antibiotics given to residents is for UTI, and at least half of these antibiotics are inappropriate regarding the drug choice, dose, or duration given.

### Current and emerging strategies to curb antibiotic-resistant urinary tract infections [^113w9t1z]. Nature Reviews Urology (2024). High credibility.

Rising rates of antibiotic resistance in uropathogenic bacteria compromise patient outcomes and prolong hospital stays. Consequently, new strategies are needed to prevent and control the spread of antibiotic resistance in uropathogenic bacteria. Over the past two decades, sizeable clinical efforts and research advances have changed urinary tract infection (UTI) treatment and prevention strategies to conserve antibiotic use.

- **Antimicrobial stewardship**: The emergence of antimicrobial stewardship, policies from national societies, and the development of new antimicrobials have shaped modern UTI practices. Future UTI management practices could be driven by the evolution of antimicrobial stewardship, improved and readily available diagnostics, and an improved understanding of how the microbiome affects UTI.

Forthcoming UTI treatment and prevention strategies could employ novel bactericidal compounds, combinations of new and classic antimicrobials that enhance bacterial killing, medications that prevent bacterial attachment to uroepithelial cells, repurposing drugs, and vaccines to curtail the rising rates of antibiotic resistance in uropathogenic bacteria and improve outcomes in people with UTI.

### Procalcitonin and pyuria-based algorithm reduces antibiotic use in urinary tract infections: a randomized controlled trial [^112Axdyr]. BMC Medicine (2015). High credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common drivers of antibiotic use and hospitalizations. In the United States, almost 10 million outpatients are diagnosed with UTIs each year, and UTIs account for 16% of all infectious disease-related hospitalizations and 6% of all infectious disease-related deaths. Despite various prevention strategies, recurrent UTIs (reUTIs) are very common.

Any reduction of antibiotic exposure is important to diminish selection pressure for antibiotic resistance, costs, and drug-related side effects. Guidelines for the duration of antibiotic treatment for febrile UTI/pyelonephritis largely reflect expert opinion, as only few intervention studies have compared different durations. Most studies in this regard were performed to establish short-term therapy in uncomplicated simple UTIs. Motivated by the emerging antibiotic resistance of uropathogens and the ecological effects of antibiotics, the minimal effective duration of antibiotic therapy is being challenged, especially in the elderly, in whom UTIs are often over-diagnosed and therefore over-treated. The use of biomarkers might improve the management of patients with UTIs.

The biomarker procalcitonin (PCT) was established for antibiotic stewardship in respiratory tract infections and sepsis. As an indicator for systemic infections, it showed high prognostic value in predicting bacteremia in patients with urosepsis. In the PRORATA trial, which documented a safe reduction of antibiotic usage through a PCT-guided strategy in patients with sepsis, UTIs were the source of infection in 7% of patients.

### Impact of laboratory-reported urine culture colony counts on the diagnosis and treatment of urinary tract infection for hospitalized patients [^116A5Pq6]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2012). Low credibility.

Reducing health care-associated urinary tract infection (UTI) is a National Patient Safety Goal. The purpose of this investigation was to establish a colony count threshold to predict clinically significant UTIs that develop in hospitalized patients. A total of 185 cases were reviewed sequentially by two physicians. The information extracted included subjective complaints, presence of an indwelling urinary catheter, clinical signs and symptoms, WBC count, urinalysis, and urine culture results. The first reviewer recorded whether the patient was diagnosed and treated for a UTI by the clinician. The second reviewer determined if the patient met National Healthcare Safety Network guidelines for nosocomial UTI.

Compared with patients with colony counts less than 100,000 colony-forming units per milliliter (CFU/mL), patients with colony counts of 100,000 CFU/mL or more were 73.86 times more likely to have a clinically significant UTI (odds ratio, 73.86; 95% confidence interval, 24.23 ∼ 225.15; P < .0001; c-statistic, 0.859). Reporting positive results only for patients with 100,000 CFU/mL or more would have reduced the number of positive cultures by 38%.

These data suggest that reporting colony counts less than 100,000 CFU/mL encourages treatment of non-clinically significant UTIs in hospitalized patients, causing inappropriate antibiotic use.

### Critically ill health care-associated urinary tract infection: Broad vs. narrow antibiotics in the emergency department have similar outcomes [^117DzMZP]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is the second most common infection requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission in emergency department (ED) patients. Optimal empiric management for health care-associated (HCA) UTI is unclear, particularly in the critically ill.

- **Objective**: To compare clinical failure of broad vs. narrow antibiotic selection in the ED for patients presenting with HCA UTI admitted to the ICU.

- **Methods**: Observational cohort of patients started on empiric antibiotic for UTI with at least one HCA risk factor (reUTI, chronic urinary catheter or dialysis, urologic procedures, previous antibiotic exposure, hospitalization, or group facility residence). Broad antibiotics covered Pseudomonas spp. and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase. Clinical failure was a composite of multiorgan dysfunction (MODS) by day 2 and in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes were length of stay (LOS), readmission, reinfection, development of multidrug-resistant organisms, and Clostridium difficile infection. Associations were reported with odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI).

- **Results**: There were 272 patients included; 196 (72.1%) received broad and 76 (27.9%) received narrow therapy. There was no association between antibiotic selection and clinical failure (OR 1.05, 95% CI 0.5–2.25, p = 0.89) or between antibiotic selection and number of HCA risk factors (OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.73–1.31, p = 0.87). There was an association between clinical failure and MODS on ICU admission (OR 9.14, 95% CI 4.70–17.78, p < 0.001). Hospital LOS and readmission did not_marker_

### Antibiotic use in hospital urinary tract infections after FDA regulation [^117QuuGa]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2024). High credibility.

The FDA issued a "black box" warning regarding the risks of fluoroquinolones in 2008, with updates in 2011, 2013, and 2016.

- **Objective**: To examine antimicrobial use in hospital-treated UTIs from 2000 to 2020.

- **Design**: Cross-sectional study with interrupted time series analysis.

- **Participants**: Patient encounters with a diagnosis of UTI from January 2000 to March 2020, excluding diagnoses of renal abscess, chronic cystitis, and infection of the gastrointestinal tract, lungs, or prostate.

- **Main measures**: Monthly use of fluoroquinolone and non-fluoroquinolone antibiotics was assessed. Fluoroquinolone resistance was evaluated in available cultures. An interrupted time series analysis examined the level and trend changes of antimicrobial use with each FDA label change.

- **Key results**: A total of 9,950,790 patient encounters were included. From July 2008 to March 2020, fluoroquinolone use declined from 61.7% to 11.7%, with similar negative trends observed in inpatients and outpatients, age ≥ 60 and < 60 years, males and females, patients with and without pyelonephritis, and across physician specialties. Ceftriaxone use increased from 26.4% of encounters in July 2008 to 63.6% of encounters in March 2020. Among encounters with available culture data, fluoroquinolone resistance declined by 28.9% from 2009 to 2020. In the interrupted time series analysis, the July 2008 FDA warning was associated with a trend change (-0.32%, p < 0.001) and a level change (-5.02%, p < 0.001) in monthly fluoroquinolone use.

- **Conclusions**: During this era of "black box" warnings, there was a decline in fluoroquinolone use.

### Current prescribing practices and guideline concordance for the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women [^1153i1uC]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). High credibility.

Uncomplicated urinary tract infections are one of the most common bacterial infections in the United States. Clinical practice guidelines from the Infectious Diseases Society of America recommend nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and fosfomycin as first-line antibiotic treatments and discourage the use of fluoroquinolone antibiotic agents. The US Food and Drug Administration has released several black box warnings about fluoroquinolones over the past decade due to antibiotic resistance and a high burden of adverse events. Historically, these infections have had high rates of guideline-discordant treatments, with past studies noting substantial use of fluoroquinolones, directly contradicting clinical practice guidelines.

- **Objective**: This study aimed to assess the concordance of physician prescribing practices with Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines for the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women and identify patient and physician predictors of guideline concordance.

- **Study design**: A retrospective observational secondary analysis was conducted using a series of cross-sectional data extracted from the IQVIA (Plymouth Meeting, Pennsylvania) National Disease and Therapeutic Index from 2015 to 2019. An estimated 44.9 million women with uncomplicated urinary tract infections, aged 18 to 75 years, were treated as outpatients. This population was selected to lack relevant comorbidities or urological abnormalities to match the Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines.

### A comparison of short versus long course intravenous antibiotics when treating urinary tract infection in infants < 60 days of age [^1159u2uV]. Clinical Pediatrics (2023). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are a common reason for hospitalization in infants younger than 60 days. The optimal approach to intravenous (IV) antibiotic therapy upon UTI diagnosis in this cohort is unknown. We investigated whether there was an association between the duration of IV antibiotic therapy — long (> 3 days) versus short (≤ 3 days) — and treatment failure, via a retrospective review of infants with confirmed UTIs receiving IV antibiotics at a tertiary referral center.

A total of 403 infants were included in the study. Of these, 39% were treated with ampicillin and cefotaxime, and 34% with ampicillin and gentamycin or tobramycin. The median IV antibiotic duration was 5 days (interquartile range: 3–10 days), and 5% of the patients experienced treatment failure. The treatment failure rate was similar in both short- and long-course IV antibiotic groups (P > .05), indicating no significant association between treatment duration and failure.

In conclusion, treatment failure for infants hospitalized with UTIs is uncommon and not associated with the duration of IV antibiotic therapy.

### Predictive utility of prior positive urine cultures [^111M2WqX]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

A patient's prior urine cultures are often considered when choosing empiric antibiotic therapy for a suspected urinary tract infection. We sought to evaluate how well previous urine cultures predict the identity and susceptibility of organisms in a patient's subsequent urine cultures.

- **Methods**: We conducted a multinational, multicenter, retrospective cohort study, including 22,019 pairs of positive urine cultures from 4,351 patients across 2 healthcare systems in Toronto, Ontario, and Chicago, Illinois. We examined the probability of the same organism being identified from the same patient's positive urine culture as a function of time elapsed from the previous positive urine specimen; in cases where the same organism was identified, we also examined the likelihood of the organism exhibiting the same or better antimicrobial susceptibility profile.

- **Results**: At 4–8 weeks between cultures, the correspondence in isolate identity was 57% (95% confidence interval, 55%-59%), and at > 32 weeks it was 49% (95% CI, 48%-50%), still greater than expected by chance (P < .001). Despite high local rates of ciprofloxacin resistance in urine isolates across all patients (40%; 95% CI, 39.5%-40.5%), ciprofloxacin resistance was < 20% among patients with a prior ciprofloxacin-sensitive organism and no subsequent fluoroquinolone exposure.

- **Conclusions**: A patient's prior urine culture results can be a valuable consideration in predicting subsequent positive urine culture findings.

### Diagnosis and management of urinary tract infection and pyelonephritis [^115e9Bwk]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are the most common bacterial infections treated in the outpatient setting, ranging in severity from minimally symptomatic cystitis to severe septic shock in a wide array of patients. Diagnosis of uncomplicated cystitis can be inferred from history and physical examination and confirmed by urinalysis. Appropriate antimicrobial therapy should rapidly improve symptoms in all UTIs. Treatment can be further tailored according to the severity of illness, analysis of individualized risk factors, and antimicrobial resistance patterns. This article discusses treatment options in light of bacterial resistance in the twenty-first century.

### Procalcitonin and pyuria-based algorithm reduces antibiotic use in urinary tract infections: a randomized controlled trial [^112VzpBs]. BMC Medicine (2015). High credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common drivers of antibiotic use. The minimal effective duration of antibiotic therapy for UTIs is unknown, but any reduction is important to diminish selection pressure for antibiotic resistance, costs, and drug-related side effects. This study aimed to investigate whether an algorithm based on procalcitonin (PCT) and quantitative pyuria reduces antibiotic exposure.

From April 2012 to March 2014, a factorial design randomized controlled open-label trial was conducted. Immunocompetent adults with community-acquired non-catheter-related UTI were enrolled in the emergency department of a tertiary-care 600-bed hospital in northwestern Switzerland. Clinical presentation was used to guide initiation and duration of antibiotic therapy according to guidelines (control group) or with a PCT-pyuria-based algorithm (PCT-pyuria group).

The primary endpoint was overall antibiotic exposure within 90 days. Secondary endpoints included the duration of the initial antibiotic therapy, persistent infection 7 days after the end of therapy and 30 days after enrollment, recurrence, and rehospitalizations within 90 days.

Overall, 394 patients were screened. Of these, 228 met predefined exclusion criteria, 30 declined to participate, and 11 were not eligible. A total of 125 patients (76% women) were enrolled in the intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis, and 96 patients with microbiologically confirmed UTI constituted the per protocol group. Of the 125 patients, 84 (67%) had a febrile UTI, 28 (22%) had bacteremia, 5 (4%) died, and 3 (2%) were lost to follow-up.

Regarding specific circumstances for catheter-associated urinary tract infection, more specifically with respect to patients with asymptomatic bacteriuria, the IDSA 2010 guidelines recommend diagnosing CA-ASB in patients with:

- **Indwelling or intermittent catheterization**: This includes an indwelling urethral or suprapubic catheter, or intermittent catheterization.

- **Absence of UTI symptoms**: Patients should not show symptoms and signs compatible with a urinary tract infection.

- **Bacterial growth in urine specimen**: There should be growth of ≥ 10⁵ CFU/mL of ≥ 1 bacterial species in a single catheter urine specimen.

### Urinary tract infection and asymptomatic bacteriuria in older adults [^113kGXtE]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are a significant cause of morbidity among older adults. However, antibiotic prescriptions for clinically suspected UTIs are often inappropriate. Health care providers frequently struggle to differentiate UTI from asymptomatic bacteriuria, particularly in patients presenting with nonspecific symptoms. Patients with baseline cognitive impairments that limit history-taking can be particularly challenging.

This article reviews the epidemiology and pathogenesis of UTI in older adults and discusses an approach to diagnosis and treatment focused on recognizing patients who would likely benefit from antibiotic treatment and identifying patients for whom empiric antibiotic therapy should not be given.

### Antibiotic switches in urinary tract infection are associated with atypical symptoms and emergent care [^116bEBSt]. Urogynecology (2024). Low credibility.

Given worsening global antibiotic resistance, antimicrobial stewardship aims to use the shortest effective duration of the most narrow-spectrum, effective antibiotic for patients with specific urinary symptoms and laboratory testing consistent with urinary tract infection (UTI). Inappropriate treatment and unnecessary antibiotic switching for UTIs harms patients in a multitude of ways.

This study sought to analyze antibiotic treatment failures as measured by antibiotic switching for treatment of UTI in emergent and ambulatory care.

For this retrospective cohort study, 908 encounters during July 2019 bearing a diagnostic code for UTI/cystitis in a single health care system were reviewed. Urinary and microbiological testing, symptoms endorsed at presentation, and treatments prescribed were extracted from the medical record.

Of 908 patients diagnosed with UTI, 64% of patients (579/908) received antibiotics, 86% of which were empiric. All patients evaluated in emergent care settings were prescribed antibiotics empirically in contrast to 71% of patients in ambulatory settings (P < 0.001). Of patients given antibiotics, 89 of 579 patients (15%, 10% of all 908 patients) were switched to alternative antibiotics within 28 days. Emergent care settings and positive urine cultures were significantly associated with increased antibiotic switching. Patients subjected to switching tended to have higher rates of presenting symptoms inconsistent with UTI.

Empiric treatment, particularly in an emergent care setting, was frequently associated with antibiotic switches.

### Proposing the "continuum of UTI" for a nuanced approach to diagnosis and management of urinary tract infections [^116TBNh8]. The Journal of Urology (2024). High credibility.

Patients with suspected UTIs are commonly categorized into three clinical phenotypes based on guidelines: no UTI, asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB), or UTI. However, not all patients fit neatly into these groups. This study aimed to characterize clinical presentations of patients who receive urine tests using the "continuum of UTI" approach.

This retrospective cohort study analyzed a random sample of adult noncatheterized inpatient and emergency department encounters. These encounters included paired urinalysis and urine cultures from five hospitals across three states between January 1, 2017, and December 31, 2019. Trained abstractors collected clinical (e.g. symptom) and demographic data. A focus group discussion with multidisciplinary experts was conducted to define the continuum of UTI, establishing a five-level classification scheme. This scheme included two new categories: lower urinary tract symptoms/other urologic symptoms and bacteriuria of unclear significance. The newly defined continuum of UTI categories was compared to the traditional UTI classification scheme.

Out of 220,531 encounters, 3,392 randomly selected encounters were reviewed. According to the traditional classification scheme, 32.1% (n = 704) were deemed to have ASB, and 53% (n = 1,614) were classified as not having a UTI. When applying the continuum of UTI categories, 68% of patients (n = 478) with ASB were reclassified as having bacteriuria of unclear significance. Additionally, 29% of patients (n = 467) initially classified as having "no UTI" were reclassified as having lower urinary tract symptoms/other urologic symptoms.

Our data suggest the need to reframe our conceptual model of UTI vs. ASB to reflect the findings of this study.

### Antibiotic management of urinary tract infections in the post-antibiotic era: a narrative review highlighting diagnostic and antimicrobial stewardship [^114hHBBu]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2023). Low credibility.

As one of the most common indications for antimicrobial prescription in the community, the management of urinary tract infections (UTIs) is both complicated by, and a driver of, antimicrobial resistance.

- **Objectives**: To highlight the key clinical decisions involved in the diagnosis and treatment of UTIs in adult women, focusing on clinical effectiveness and both diagnostic and antimicrobial stewardship as we approach the post-antimicrobial era.

- **Sources**: Literature was reviewed via directed PubMed searches and manual searching of the reference list for included studies to identify key references to respond to the objectives. A strict time limit was not applied, but we prioritized recent publications, randomized trials, and systematic reviews (with or without meta-analyses) where available. Searches were limited to English-language articles. A formal quality assessment was not performed; however, the strengths and limitations of each paper were reviewed by the authors throughout the preparation of this manuscript.

- **Content**: We discuss the management of UTIs in ambulatory adult women, with a particular focus on uncomplicated infections. We address the diagnosis of UTIs, including the definition and categorization; bedside assessments and point-of-care tests; and the indications for, and use of, laboratory tests. We then discuss the treatment of UTIs, including the indications for treatment, antimicrobial sparing approaches, key considerations when selecting a specific antimicrobial agent, specific treatment scenarios, and the duration of treatment.

### Defining effective durations of antibiotic therapy for community-acquired pneumonia and urinary tract infections in hospitalized children [^112SQDPL]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2022). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and urinary tract infections (UTI) are two common childhood infections often leading to hospital admission. National guidelines for CAP and UTI in children recommend durations of antibiotic therapy of 10 days and 7–14 days, respectively. Due to concerns of rising antimicrobial resistance and an increased awareness of harms associated with prolonged courses of antibiotics, there is a renewed emphasis on reevaluating commonly prescribed durations of antibiotic therapy across bacterial infections. Recent clinical trials and observational studies have evaluated durations of therapy for CAP and UTI in adults and children. We translate these findings to suggest an approach for selecting durations of antibiotic therapy in hospitalized children.

- **Recent findings**: There is a growing body of evidence, primarily in adults, that shorter durations of therapy than are commonly prescribed are just as effective as longer durations for CAP and UTIs.

- **Summary**: Combining clinical trial data from adults with available data in children, we believe it is reasonable to consider 5 days of therapy for CAP, 3–5 days of therapy for cystitis, and 7 days of therapy for pyelonephritis for most hospitalized children with uncomplicated infections.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis for urinary tract infections after removal of urinary catheter: Meta-analysis [^113zMkff]. BMJ (2013). Low credibility.

To determine whether antibiotic prophylaxis at the time of removal of a urinary catheter reduces the risk of subsequent symptomatic urinary tract infection, a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies published before November 2012 was conducted. Studies were identified through PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library, and conference abstracts from 2006–2012 were also reviewed.

Studies were included if they examined antibiotic prophylaxis administered to prevent symptomatic urinary tract infection after the removal of a short-term (≤ 14 days) urinary catheter. Seven controlled studies were identified with symptomatic urinary tract infection after catheter removal as an endpoint. Six were randomized controlled trials (five published; one in abstract form) and one was a non-randomized controlled intervention study. Five of these seven studies were conducted in surgical patients.

- **Results**: The studies were heterogeneous in the type and duration of antimicrobial prophylaxis and the period of observation. Overall, antibiotic prophylaxis was associated with benefit to the patient, with an absolute reduction in risk of urinary tract infection of 5.8% between intervention and control groups. The risk ratio was 0.45 (95% confidence interval 0.28 to 0.72). The number needed to treat to prevent one urinary tract infection was 17 (12 to 30).

- **Conclusions**: Patients admitted to the hospital who undergo short-term urinary catheterization might benefit from antimicrobial prophylaxis when the catheter is removed, as they experience fewer subsequent urinary tract infections.

### Antibiotic overprescription for "urinary tract infections" is associated with poor diagnostic stewardship and low adherence to guidelines [^117EvPBG]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2025). Low credibility.

Overtesting for urinary tract infections (UTIs) is leading to overtreatment in asymptomatic patients. The presence of urinary symptoms occurring with a positive culture in the absence of vaginal symptoms are key features of appropriate UTI diagnosis; however, our data showed that of the patients in the ER who were diagnosed with a UTI, only 28% had symptoms consistent with a UTI. This aligns well with previous studies examining rates of cystitis symptoms in those diagnosed with a UTI in the ER.

In addition to being more likely to be tested for a UTI, patients treated in the ER were also more likely to receive antibiotics for a UTI than patients who sought care in an outpatient setting (ER: 95%, 189/209 vs. Office: 55%, 390/740). While it might be hypothesized that ER patients would have a more severe presentation or be more frail, our data showed the ER patients tended to be younger overall with similar clinical features, including similar rates of urinary symptoms, vaginal symptoms, and culture positivity. Together, these findings may indicate that overtesting of patients in the ER for UTI is driving much of the inappropriate treatment of both asymptomatic bacteriuria and culture-negative subjects with nonspecific symptoms.

Urinary testing should be reserved for patients with symptoms consistent with a UTI. It is important to note that more than half of urine cultures for both patients evaluated in the ER and outpatient-based clinics were negative. In most of the encounters in which culture-negative patients were treated with antimicrobials for UTI, the rationale to provide antibiotics was either poor or unsupported.

### Antibiotic utilization and symptom improvement in a retrospective cohort of women with urinary tract infection symptoms [^111s6SGX]. International Urogynecology Journal (2024). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are one of the most common bacterial infections in women. We hypothesized that over half of those treated empirically would receive inappropriate antibiotics, those treated expectantly would have lower symptom improvement without antibiotics, and that overall progression to sequelae would be uncommon.

- **Methods**: In this retrospective cohort study of women with UTI symptoms, we quantified the proportion who received inappropriate antibiotics in those treated empirically. This group was defined as those with a negative urine culture or antibiotics that were changed according to culture sensitivities. We also identified factors associated with symptom improvement during expectant management. Secondarily, we sought to determine the proportion of UTI sequelae in both groups. During the study timeframe, a modified UTI Symptom Assessment (UTISA) questionnaire was administered at baseline and again, with a global rating for change instrument, when urine culture results were relayed.

- **Results**: Analyses included 152 women, with a mean age of 66.5 years (SD 15.0). Of these, 30 (20%) received empiric antibiotics, and 122 (80%) underwent expectant management. At baseline, the empiric group reported greater mean scores for dysuria, urgency, frequency, and incomplete emptying (p < 0.01 for each). Positive culture results were reported for 16 (53%) in the empiric group and 72 (59%) in the expectant group. Inappropriate antibiotics were prescribed to 18 (60%) of the empiric group. A negative urine culture was associated with improvement in symptoms in the expectant management group.

### Effect of 7 vs 14 days of antibiotic therapy on resolution of symptoms among afebrile men with urinary tract infection: A randomized clinical trial [^1171F9GK]. JAMA (2021). High credibility.

Determination of optimal treatment durations for common infectious diseases is an important strategy to preserve antibiotic effectiveness. This study aimed to determine whether 7 days of treatment is noninferior to 14 days when using ciprofloxacin or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole to treat urinary tract infection (UTI) in afebrile men.

The research was conducted as a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled noninferiority trial. It involved afebrile men with presumed symptomatic UTI treated with ciprofloxacin or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole at two US Veterans Affairs medical centers. The enrollment period was from April 2014 through December 2019, with the final follow-up on January 28, 2020. Of 1058 eligible men, 272 were randomized.

Participants continued the antibiotic prescribed by their treating clinician for 7 days of treatment. They were then randomized to receive either continued antibiotic therapy (n = 136) or a placebo (n = 136) for days 8 to 14 of treatment.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: The prespecified primary outcome was the resolution of UTI symptoms by 14 days after completion of active antibiotic treatment. A noninferiority margin of 10% was selected. The as-treated population (participants who took ≥ 26 of 28 doses and missed no more than 2 consecutive doses) was used for the primary analysis. A secondary analysis included all patients as randomized, regardless of treatment adherence. Secondary outcomes included the recurrence of UTI symptoms and/or adverse events within 28 days of stopping the study medication.

- **Results**: Among 272 patients (median [interquartile range] age, 69 [62–73] years), the study aimed to establish the efficacy of shorter-duration antibiotic therapy.
