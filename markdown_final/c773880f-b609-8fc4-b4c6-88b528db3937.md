## Question

Why there is Finestra in liver sinusoid

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking why there are fenestrae in liver sinusoids. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the unique anatomy and definition of liver sinusoidal endothelial cells. Then, I should verify the core physiological functions enabled by fenestrae, including filtration, lipoprotein handling, and immune surveillance. Next, I will examine the immunologic and hemodynamic consequences of fenestration. After that, I need to check how fenestrae are dynamically regulated and what molecular pathways control their number and size. Finally, I will consider what happens when fenestrae are lost in disease and whether restoring them is therapeutically meaningful, before synthesizing a concise conclusion.

> Let me first confirm the anatomical uniqueness. Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) are discontinuous endothelial cells that lack a basement membrane and possess transcytoplasmic pores called fenestrae, typically 50–300 nm in diameter and organized in sieve plates. This contrasts with continuous capillaries and even other fenestrated beds, making LSECs the most permeable endothelial barrier in mammals [^7c4034ec] [^7a844cfe] [^48146d4e].

> Now, I should verify the primary physiological rationale: filtration and exchange. Fenestrae create a size-selective sieve that permits free passage of solutes, macromolecules, and lipoprotein remnants while excluding chylomicrons, thereby enabling efficient bidirectional exchange between sinusoidal blood and the space of Disse where hepatocytes reside. This architecture underpins hepatic metabolic processing and clearance functions [^7c4034ec] [^7a844cfe] [^48146d4e].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about lipoproteins without checking the evidence. The liver sieve hypothesis is supported by data showing that defenestration impairs chylomicron remnant clearance and contributes to postprandial hypertriglyceridemia, linking LSEC porosity to systemic lipid homeostasis and even atherogenesis in aging and disease states [^15530f8c] [^e3a2ee41].

> Next, I should review the immunologic implications. Fenestrae allow direct contact between circulating lymphocytes and hepatocytes, enabling intrahepatic antigen recognition and contributing to the liver's unique tolerogenic milieu. Effector CD8+ T cells extend filopodia through fenestrae to survey hepatocytes, and LSECs themselves present antigen and modulate T cell function, including via cAMP–PKA signaling that can restrain effector responses in chronic viral hepatitis [^7a009fef] [^06befa87] [^f3b691be].

> I need to ensure I address hemodynamics and microcirculation. LSECs regulate vascular tone and maintain low portal pressure despite variable hepatic blood flow; fenestrae and the absence of a basement membrane reduce resistance and facilitate shear-dependent signaling that helps preserve LSEC differentiation and anti-fibrotic properties, illustrating a structural–functional coupling that protects the microcirculation [^7a844cfe] [^701782f1].

> Let me consider dynamic regulation, because static anatomy is not the whole story. Fenestrae are plastic: their number and porosity can change within minutes to hours in response to biomechanical and biochemical cues. Semaphorin-3A via neuropilin-1 reduces fenestra frequency, while BMP9 maintains LSEC differentiation and fenestration; oxidative stress and lipotoxicity promote defenestration, and actin cytoskeletal regulators like p130Cas are required for fenestra formation, indicating a tightly controlled, reversible phenotype [^48146d4e] [^a2a6279b] [^85e46bf0] [^2a718aaa] [^3441a6bc].

> But wait, what if fenestrae are lost — does it matter clinically? Capillarization, with loss of fenestrae and acquisition of a basement membrane, is an early pathogenic switch in chronic liver disease that precedes and promotes hepatic stellate cell activation and fibrosis; it also impairs drug and vector delivery to hepatocytes, complicating gene and RNA therapies, and correlates with portal hypertension and metabolic dysfunction in MASLD/MASH, underscoring that fenestrae are not just structural curiosities but gatekeepers of liver homeostasis [^9776989d] [^d7bf9730] [^6d677fa1] [^7e072d3d] [^701782f1].

> I should double-check therapeutic implications, because they test causal relevance. Restoring LSEC fenestration reverses capillarization and fibrosis in preclinical models: MSC-secreted miR-325–3p delivered via spherical nucleic acids, sGC activators, and anti-angiogenic strategies that normalize LSECs all reduce fibrosis and improve microcirculation, supporting the concept that fenestrae are a viable therapeutic target in liver disease [^193a1d57] [^c9a57d23] [^47f06f3c] [^5c2be916].

> In summary, I need to ensure the synthesis is precise. Fenestrae exist in liver sinusoids because they enable the liver's core tasks: size-selective filtration of blood, efficient uptake and processing of lipoproteins, direct immune surveillance and tolerance induction, and low-resistance hemodynamics with shear-dependent maintenance of endothelial differentiation. Their dynamic regulation and early loss in disease explain why preserving or restoring fenestrae is a promising strategy to treat fibrosis and metabolic liver disease [^7c4034ec] [^7a844cfe] [^15530f8c] [^f3b691be] [^701782f1] [^193a1d57].

The liver sinusoid has fenestrae to enable **selective permeability** for efficient exchange of macromolecules, lipoproteins, and immune cells between blood and hepatocytes, supporting metabolism, clearance, and immune surveillance [^7c4034ec] [^88ccb5ad]. Fenestrae are **absent in other capillaries** because continuous endothelium with tight junctions is needed to maintain barrier function in most tissues; by contrast, the liver's discontinuous endothelium with fenestrae and no basement membrane permits rapid, bidirectional transport while preserving hepatocyte function and immune tolerance [^7a844cfe] [^ca46d162]. Loss of fenestrae (capillarization) impairs these functions and contributes to fibrosis and portal hypertension, underscoring their physiological importance [^9776989d] [^701782f1].

## Structural features of liver sinusoidal endothelium

Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) are **highly specialized** and differ markedly from endothelial cells in other capillaries:

- **Fenestrae**: Transcytoplasmic pores 50–300 nm in diameter, organized in sieve plates, allowing passage of macromolecules and lipoproteins [^48146d4e] [^54b678c8].
- **Absence of basement membrane**: Facilitates direct contact between blood and hepatocytes.
- **Low shear stress environment**: Supports unique immune and metabolic functions [^0c6793a5].

---

## Physiological functions enabled by fenestrae

Fenestrae are essential for **multiple liver functions**:

| **Function** | **Mechanism** | **Physiological significance** |
|-|-|-|
| Selective permeability | Fenestrae allow passage of macromolecules, lipoproteins, and immune cells | - Efficient nutrient delivery <br/> - Waste removal <br/> - Lipid metabolism <br/> - Immune surveillance [^7c4034ec] [^88ccb5ad] |
| Immune surveillance | Direct contact between immune cells and hepatocytes via fenestrae | - Antigen presentation <br/> - Tolerance induction <br/> - Pathogen clearance [^06befa87] [^ca46d162] |
| Lipoprotein metabolism | Fenestrae enable passage of chylomicron remnants and lipoproteins | - Regulation of lipid homeostasis <br/> - Prevention of hyperlipidemia [^15530f8c] [^e3a2ee41] |
| Drug delivery | Fenestrae allow therapeutic agents to reach hepatocytes | Enhanced efficacy of hepatocyte-targeted therapies [^e02dee0a] [^b30d6fdb] |

---

## Comparison with other capillaries

Unlike liver sinusoids, most capillaries have **continuous endothelium** with tight junctions and a basement membrane, which restricts macromolecular passage and maintains tissue-specific barriers. Fenestrated capillaries (e.g. kidney glomeruli, endocrine glands) have small fenestrae with diaphragms, but they lack the large, open pores and sieve plates characteristic of LSECs [^dfc2dff9].

---

## Consequences of fenestrae loss (capillarization)

Loss of fenestrae (**capillarization**) is a hallmark of chronic liver disease and has major consequences:

- **Impaired metabolic exchange**: Reduced nutrient delivery and waste removal.
- **Increased vascular resistance**: Contributes to portal hypertension [^701782f1].
- **Promotes fibrosis**: Activates hepatic stellate cells and extracellular matrix deposition [^9776989d].
- **Impairs drug delivery**: Reduces efficacy of hepatocyte-targeted therapies [^d7bf9730].

---

## Regulatory mechanisms of fenestrae dynamics

Fenestrae are **dynamically regulated** by multiple signaling pathways:

- **VEGF signaling**: Maintains LSEC differentiation and fenestration [^9776989d].
- **Nitric oxide (NO)**: Preserves fenestrae and LSEC function [^notfound].
- **Semaphorin-3A**: Reduces fenestrae number and porosity, linking metabolic stress to capillarization [^a2a6279b] [^d480f3f8].
- **BMP9**: Promotes LSEC differentiation and fenestration, protecting against fibrosis [^85e46bf0].

---

## Clinical implications and therapeutic strategies

Understanding fenestrae has led to **targeted therapies** aimed at restoring LSEC function:

- **Anti-fibrotic therapies**: Targeting LSEC capillarization to reverse fibrosis [^193a1d57].
- **Drug delivery**: Designing nanoparticles that exploit fenestrae for hepatocyte targeting [^e02dee0a].
- **Gene therapy**: Leveraging fenestrae for efficient hepatocyte transduction [^b30d6fdb].

Fenestrae in liver sinusoids are essential for **selective permeability**, enabling efficient metabolic exchange, immune surveillance, and drug delivery. Their unique structure distinguishes liver sinusoids from other capillaries, and their loss in disease contributes to fibrosis and portal hypertension.

### Role of liver sinusoidal endothelial cells in liver diseases [^7c4034ec]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2021). High credibility.

Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) form the wall of the hepatic sinusoids. Unlike other capillaries, they lack an organized basement membrane and have cytoplasm that is penetrated by open fenestrae, making the hepatic microvascular endothelium discontinuous. LSECs have essential roles in the maintenance of hepatic homeostasis, including regulation of the vascular tone, inflammation and thrombosis, and they are essential for control of the hepatic immune response. On a background of acute or chronic liver injury, LSECs modify their phenotype and negatively affect neighbouring cells and liver disease pathophysiology. This Review describes the main functions and phenotypic dysregulations of LSECs in liver diseases, specifically in the context of acute injury (ischaemia-reperfusion injury, drug-induced liver injury and bacterial and viral infection), chronic liver disease (metabolism-associated liver disease, alcoholic steatohepatitis and chronic hepatotoxic injury) and hepatocellular carcinoma, and provides a comprehensive update of the role of LSECs as therapeutic targets for liver disease. Finally, we discuss the open questions in the field of LSEC pathobiology and future avenues of research.

### Determinants of hepatic effector CD8T cell dynamics [^7a009fef]. Journal of Hepatology (2017). Low credibility.

Antigen-specific effector CD8 + T cells play a critical role in controlling hepatic infections, such as the one caused by hepatitis B virus (HBV). We review here recent results where we coupled advanced dynamic imaging with dedicated mouse models of HBV pathogenesis to show that circulating effector CD8 + T cells aimed at viral clearance initially arrest in liver sinusoids by preferentially docking onto platelets that have previously adhered to liver sinusoids. Upon detachment from platelets, effector CD8 + T cells crawl within the sinusoids irrespective of bloodstream direction, and probe underlying hepatocytes for the presence of antigen by extending filopodia-like protrusions through the sinusoidal fenestrae. Effector CD8 + T cells recognize hepatocellular antigen and perform effector functions (i.e. IFN-γ production and hepatocyte killing) while still in the intravascular space. They later extravasate in the parenchyma. Finally, we provide our perspective on how, in the next few years, intravital microscopy might shed new light on yet unresolved issues with particular regard to identifying the determinants of hepatic effector CD8 + T cell trafficking, antigen recognition and effector functions during hepatocellular carcinoma and understanding the mechanisms whereby intrahepatic T cell priming induces functionally defective T cell responses. A better understanding of how adaptive immunity mediates pathogen clearance and tumor elimination may lead to improved vaccination and treatment strategies for immunotherapy of infectious diseases and cancer.

### The role of liver sinusoidal cells in hepatocyte-directed gene transfer [^e02dee0a]. The American Journal of Pathology (2010). Low credibility.

Hepatocytes are a key target for gene therapy of inborn errors of metabolism as well as of acquired diseases such as liver cancer and hepatitis. Gene transfer efficiency into hepatocytes is significantly determined by histological and functional aspects of liver sinusoidal cells. On the one hand, uptake of vectors by Kupffer cells and liver sinusoidal endothelial cells may limit hepatocyte transduction. On the other hand, the presence of fenestrae in liver sinusoidal endothelial cells provides direct access to the space of Disse and allows vectors to bind to receptors on the microvillous surface of hepatocytes. Nevertheless, the diameter of fenestrae may restrict the passage of vectors according to their size. On the basis of lege artis measurements of the diameter of fenestrae in different species, we show that the diameter of fenestrae affects the distribution of transgene DNA between sinusoidal and parenchymal liver cells after adenoviral transfer. The small diameter of fenestrae in humans may underlie low efficiency of adenoviral transfer into hepatocytes in men. The disappearance of the unique morphological features of liver sinusoidal endothelial cells in pathological conditions like liver cirrhosis and liver cancer may further affect gene transfer efficiency. Preclinical gene transfer studies should consider species differences in the structure and function of liver sinusoidal cells as important determinants of gene transfer efficiency into hepatocytes.

### Transcriptional dynamics of hepatic sinusoid-associated cells after liver injury [^b74222f5]. Hepatology (2020). Medium credibility.

The hepatic sinusoid is a vascular matrix defined by liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs), intrasinusoidal Kupffer cells (KCs), natural killer cells, perisinusoidal hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), and extracellular matrix (ECM) components. (6) In particular, LSECs and pericytic HSCs are intimately associated along the porous sinusoid, (7) where they manage blood flow, the trans‐sinusoidal migration of cells, and exchange of lipoprotein particles. (8, 9, 10) Hepatic injury and inflammatory cues trigger sinusoidal cell activation, causing sinusoidal capillarization and fibrogenesis. Cytokines and growth factors from the microenvironment directly activate HSCs, which transdifferentiate into fibrogenic myofibroblasts. (11) Similarly, LSECs are transformed by angiogenic cytokines and growth factors, which act in concert with hypoxic and mechanical stress from altered blood flow and tissue stiffness. (12) LSEC activation leads to their dedifferentiation and loss of fenestration, resulting in endothelial dysfunction. (13) If the underlying insults persist, capillarization and widespread fibrosis increase portal vascular resistance, resulting in portal hypertension and aberrant angiogenesis. (8) Despite these insights and the urgency of decoding the concerted response to hepatic injury, the molecular events that forego advanced liver disease remain poorly understood. Hepatic tissue complexity, cellular heterogeneity of the sinusoids, and dynamic sinusoidal communication demand systems‐level approaches for their analysis.

### The liver as an immunological organ [^ca46d162]. Hepatology (2006). Low credibility.

The liver is a unique anatomical and immunological site in which antigen-rich blood from the gastrointestinal tract is pressed through a network of sinusoids and scanned by antigen-presenting cells and lymphocytes. The liver's lymphocyte population is selectively enriched in natural killer and natural killer T cells which play critical roles in first line immune defense against invading pathogens, modulation of liver injury and recruitment of circulating lymphocytes. Circulating lymphocytes come in close contact to antigens displayed by endothelial cells, Kupffer cells and liver resident dendritic cells in the sinusoids. Circulating lymphocytes can also contact hepatocytes directly, because the sinusoidal endothelium is fenestrated and lacks a basement membrane. This unique anatomy of the liver may facilitate direct or indirect priming of lymphocytes, modulate the immune response to hepatotrophic pathogens and contribute to some of the unique immunological properties of this organ, particularly its capacity to induce antigen-specific tolerance.

### The size of endothelial fenestrae in human liver sinusoids: implications for hepatocyte-directed gene transfer [^23eac230]. Gene Therapy (2008). Low credibility.

Fenestrae allow the passage of gene transfer vectors from the sinusoidal lumen to the surface of hepatocytes. We have previously shown that the diameter of fenestrae correlates with species and strain differences of transgene expression following intravenous adenoviral transfer. In the current study, we demonstrate that the diameter of fenestrae in humans without liver pathology is 107 ± 1.5 nm. This is similar to the previously reported diameter in New Zealand White (NZW) rabbits (103 ± 1.3 nm) and is significantly smaller than in C57BL/6 mice (141 ± 5.4 nm) and Sprague-Dawley rats (161 ± 2.7 nm). We show that the diameter of fenestrae in one male NZW rabbit and its offspring characterized by a more than 50-fold increase of transgene expression after adenoviral gene transfer is significantly (113 ± 1.5 nm; P < 0.001) larger than in control NZW rabbits. In vitro filtration experiments using polycarbonate filters with increasing pore sizes demonstrate that a relatively small increment of the diameter of pores potently enhances passage of adenoviral vectors, consistent with in vivo data. In conclusion, the small diameter of fenestrae in humans is likely to be a major obstacle for hepatocyte transduction by adenoviral vectors.

### Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells: physiology and role in liver diseases [^7a844cfe]. Journal of Hepatology (2017). Low credibility.

Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) are highly specialized endothelial cells representing the interface between blood cells on the one side and hepatocytes and hepatic stellate cells on the other side. LSECs represent a permeable barrier. Indeed, the association of 'fenestrae', absence of diaphragm and lack of basement membrane make them the most permeable endothelial cells of the mammalian body. They also have the highest endocytosis capacity of human cells. In physiological conditions, LSECs regulate hepatic vascular tone contributing to the maintenance of a low portal pressure despite the major changes in hepatic blood flow occurring during digestion. LSECs maintain hepatic stellate cell quiescence, thus inhibiting intrahepatic vasoconstriction and fibrosis development. In pathological conditions, LSECs play a key role in the initiation and progression of chronic liver diseases. Indeed, they become capillarized and lose their protective properties, and they promote angiogenesis and vasoconstriction. LSECs are implicated in liver regeneration following acute liver injury or partial hepatectomy since they renew from LSECs and/or LSEC progenitors, they sense changes in shear stress resulting from surgery, and they interact with platelets and inflammatory cells. LSECs also play a role in hepatocellular carcinoma development and progression, in ageing, and in liver lesions related to inflammation and infection. This review also presents a detailed analysis of the technical aspects relevant for LSEC analysis including the markers these cells express, the available cell lines and the transgenic mouse models. Finally, this review provides an overview of the strategies available for a specific targeting of LSECs.

### T lymphocytes interact with hepatocytes through fenestrations in murine liver sinusoidal endothelial cells [^06befa87]. Hepatology (2006). Low credibility.

The liver has an established ability to induce tolerance. Recent evidence indicates that this unique property might be related to its distinctive architecture allowing T cells to be activated in situ independently of lymphoid tissues. Unlike lymph node-activated T cells, liver-activated T cells are short-lived, a mechanism that might contribute to the "liver tolerance effect". Although the potential role of hepatocytes as tolerogenic antigen-presenting cells has been demonstrated, the question as to whether these cells are able to interact with CD8(+) T cells in physiological settings remains controversial. Contradicting the immunological dogma stating that naïve T lymphocytes are prevented from interacting with parenchymal cells within non-lymphoid organs by an impenetrable endothelial barrier, we show here that the unique morphology of the liver sinusoidal endothelial cell (LSEC) permits interactions between lymphocytes and hepatocytes. Using electron microscopy, we demonstrate that liver resident lymphocytes as well as circulating naïve CD8(+) T cells make direct contact with hepatocytes through cytoplasmic extensions penetrating the endothelial fenestrations that perforate the LSECs. Furthermore, the expression of molecules required for primary T cell activation, MHC class I and ICAM-1, is polarized on hepatocytes to the perisinusoidal cell membrane, thus maximizing the opportunity for interactions with circulating lymphocytes. In conclusion, this study has identified, at the ultrastructural level, a unique type of interaction between naïve T lymphocytes and liver parenchymal cells in vivo. These results hold implications for the pathogenesis of viral hepatitis in which hepatocytes may represent the main antigen-presenting cell, and for the development of immune tolerance as lymphocytes pass through the liver.

### Tracking fenestrae dynamics in live murine liver sinusoidal endothelial cells [^54b678c8]. Hepatology (2019). Medium credibility.

The fenestrae of liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) allow passive transport of solutes, macromolecules, and particulate material between the sinusoidal lumen and the liver parenchymal cells. Until recently, fenestrae and fenestrae-associated structures were mainly investigated using electron microscopy on chemically fixed LSECs. Hence, the knowledge about their dynamic properties has remained to date largely elusive. Recent progress in atomic force microscopy (AFM) has allowed the study of live cells in three dimensions (X, Y, and Z) over a prolonged time (t) and this at unprecedented speeds and resolving power. Hence, we employed the latest advances in AFM imaging on living LSECs. As a result, we were able to monitor the position, size, and number of fenestrae and sieve plates using four-dimensional AFM (X, Y, Z, and t) on intact LSECs in vitro. During these time-lapse experiments, dynamic data were collected on the origin and morphofunctional properties of the filtration apparatus of LSECs. We present structural evidence on single laying and grouped fenestrae, thereby elucidating their dynamic nature from formation to disappearance. We also collected data on the life span of fenestrae. More especially, the formation and closing of entire sieve plates were observed, and how the continuous rearrangement of sieve plates affects the structure of fenestrae within them was recorded. We observed also the dawn and rise of fenestrae-forming centers and defenestration centers in LSECs under different experimental conditions. Conclusion: Utilizing a multimodal biomedical high-resolution imaging technique we collected fine structural information on the life span, formation, and disappearance of LSEC fenestrae; by doing so, we also gathered evidence on three different pathways implemented in the loss of fenestrae that result in defenestrated LSECs.

### Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells-gatekeepers of hepatic immunity [^88ccb5ad]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2018). Medium credibility.

Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) line the low shear, sinusoidal capillary channels of the liver and are the most abundant non-parenchymal hepatic cell population. LSECs do not simply form a barrier within the hepatic sinusoids but have vital physiological and immunological functions, including filtration, endocytosis, antigen presentation and leukocyte recruitment. Reflecting these multifunctional properties, LSECs display unique structural and phenotypic features that differentiate them from the capillary endothelium present within other organs. It is now clear that LSECs have a critical role in maintaining immune homeostasis within the liver and in mediating the immune response during acute and chronic liver injury. In this Review, we outline how LSECs influence the immune microenvironment within the liver and discuss their contribution to immune-mediated liver diseases and the complications of fibrosis and carcinogenesis.

### Transcriptional dynamics of hepatic sinusoid-associated cells after liver injury [^a8112573]. Hepatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Sinusoidal remodeling is a defining event during the development of hepatic fibrosis. HSCs and LSECs associated along the healthy sinusoids undergo phenotypic transitions, leading to the loss of sinusoidal fenestrations, basal lamina formation, and perisinusoidal fibrosis. (13) This perturbs microvascular exchange between the sinusoid and hepatic parenchyma, increases vascular resistance, and raises portal pressure.

In the current study we applied single‐cell RNA sequencing to determine the transcriptional dynamics of sinusoidal cell populations during DILI in mice and validated key findings using patient data and liver tissue. Experimental DILI led to global activation of all HSCs, followed by stepwise progression through discrete activation states from Angptl6 ‐, Bmp5 ‐, Ecm1 ‐, and Plvap ‐expressing pericytes to myofibroblastic cells expressing ECM proteins and profibrotic mediators. The acute repression of genes upon HSC activation, causing an immediate decline in pericyte function, may directly implicate HSC activation in LSEC capillarization. The loss of PLVAP in particular could have major implications for microvascular dynamics. In fetal and neonatal livers, PLVAP is confined to the diaphragmed fenestra of LSECs, forming a physical sieve that regulates cellular transmigration and passage of lipoprotein particles across the sinusoid. (10, 32) Our findings indicate that PLVAP expression partly shifts to HSCs in the adult sinusoid, displaying open fenestra without diaphragm. The expression of PLVAP by HSCs highlights HSCs and LSECs as a functional entity of the sinusoidal barrier, where suppression of PLVAP upon injury may affect permeability and parenchymal accessibility for immune cells. Notably, Plvap ‐null livers are marked by inflammation and diffuse perisinusoidal fibrosis. (32)

### Semaphorin-3A regulates liver sinusoidal endothelial cell porosity and promotes hepatic steatosis [^b3a70654]. Nature Cardiovascular Research (2024). High credibility.

Heterozygous deletion of Sema3a increases fenestrae number

As our gain-of-function experiments revealed that SEMA3A lowers frequency of fenestrae in LSECs, we next asked whether, in turn, deletion of Sema3a increases the fenestrae frequency in LSECs. Due to high perinatal lethality of homozygous Sema3a −/− (knockout) mice, we analyzed adult heterozygous Sema3a +/− mice and their wild-type littermates. Sema3a +/− mice were viable, showed no obvious phenotypic differences from their control littermates, and displayed an approximate 40% reduction in LSEC Sema3a mRNA compared to wild-type controls (Extended Data Fig. 4a). To analyze the LSEC ultrastructure in these mice, we prepared liver samples from adult (29-week-old) Sema3a +/− mice and littermate controls for SEM (Fig. 6a). Sinusoids of Sema3a +/− mice were characterized by fenestrated LSECs and not easily distinguishable from control sinusoids at a cellular level. To quantify fenestrae frequency and diameter as well as porosity of hepatic sinusoids, we developed a fenestrae-detecting plugin for liver sinusoids based on a dataset-trained-classifier segmentation algorithm by using the image analysis software Fiji. This plugin generated probability maps for surface area and fenestrae area (Extended Data Fig. 5a), which were used to quantify fenestrae diameter and frequency as well as LSEC porosity in liver tissue from Sema3a +/− and wild-type littermate controls.

### Vasomics of the liver [^51107ef9]. Gut (2025). Medium credibility.

Histology

A key feature of the liver sinusoidal dysfunction is the capillarisation process, the reduction in number and size of the fenestrae. This process can be driven by chronic liver disease as well as due to ageing. In HCC, the tumour vasculature includes distinct types of abnormal microvessels: sinusoid like and capillary like. Sinusoid-like microvessels resemble the irregular, dilated hepatic sinusoids with a discontinuous endothelium, reflecting the tumour's attempt to mimic the normal liver environment. In contrast, capillary-like microvessels are more uniform and structured, with a continuous endothelium and a defined basement membrane, resembling typical capillaries found in other tissues. This vascular heterogeneity, driven by the need to recapitulate liver vasculature and at the same time to furnish an appropriate perfusion for the aberrant growth rate, in HCC influences tumour progression, prognosis and response to therapies, particularly those targeting angiogenesis. A critical pathological feature in HCC is the microvascular invasion (MVI) that, besides its diagnostic role, has a prognostic value. Histological grade and extranodular growth are closely associated with MVI in HCC. Sinusoid-like microvessels are associated with more MVI than capillary-like microvessels. Patients with MVI in the sinusoid-like microvessel group had higher risks of recurrence and poor prognosis. In addition, there is a need for a prospectively validated grading scale to assess MVI in relation to the type of vessel (portal vein, hepatic vein, vessel with thick muscular wall, artery and capsular vessel), number of vessels involved and distance of the vessels involved from the primary tumour. Porto-sinusoidal vascular disease is a nomenclature used to identify complex and multifaceted diseases affecting intrahepatic microvascular structures. The alterations of histology include a variety of vascular phenotypes, such as a hypervascularised portal tract, the existence of periportal abnormal vessels, herniated portal vein branches, irregularly distributed portal tracts and central veins.

Arterial density observed during liver biopsy has been demonstrated to be a valuable indicator for staging liver fibrosis and cirrhosis. It increased significantly with Ishak and Laennec fibrosis stage and decreased after antiviral therapy in patients with chronic hepatitis B, indicating that artery density might be a measure of hepatic lobular collapse. In advanced cirrhosis, new hepatocyte nodules derived from the budding of ductulus occur along portal vein branches. This special structure hinders the restoration of normal liver structures. Septal thickness and nodule size have also been reported to be linked to the severity of PH.

### The fibrotic and immune microenvironments as targetable drivers of metastasis [^d3b872cb]. British Journal of Cancer (2021). Medium credibility.

The formation of a metastatic microenvironment in the liver

Following metastatic spread, cancer cells from a number of primary malignancies find themselves in the liver, which appears to be a preferred site of metastasis for many tumours. – Why the liver is such a privileged site is a topic of much debate. Nevertheless, for a metastatic cell to take hold, the recipient organ requires an extensive vascular network to provide ready access for the cancer cell. Moreover, to establish a secondary tumour, the cancer cells must be able to take over a dynamic local immune environment that it can utilise to facilitate its growth.

Sinusoids: cellular suppressors of metastasis

The vasculature of the liver is highly specialised, with blood entering through the portal circulation and passing through sinusoids. These narrow vessels, which are lined with sieve-like fenestrated endothelial cells (liver sinusoidal endothelial cells; LSECs), form a highly permeable barrier that facilitates the rapid exchange of biological and xenobiotic compounds between the blood and the metabolic hepatocytes. As blood passes through this highly efficient filtration system, it is surveyed by local populations of immune cells adjacent to the LSECs, including Kupffer cells (resident hepatic macrophages) and other circulating lymphocytes (Fig. 3). Within the lumen of hepatic sinusoids, CTCs have the potential to extravasate to initiate a metastasis; however, relatively few do. Although a number of CTCs might pass through the hepatic sinusoids, many will be killed by a complex sinusoidal immune surveillance network. Importantly, the sinusoids function as active cellular suppressors of metastasis, with cytokine and chemokine crosstalk between sinusoidal endothelial cells, Kupffer cells, and circulating lymphocytes acting together to identify CTCs and mark them for cellular killing. This multicellular approach involves the release of pro-apoptotic factors, such as reactive oxygen species, nitric oxide and interferon-γ, by sinusoidal endothelial cells, thereby inducing the direct apoptosis of CTCs. In tandem with this, Kupffer cells lining the sinusoids are able to detect the presence of cancer cells and, through the release of a number of pro-inflammatory cytokines, recruit a transient lymphocyte niche that senses and targets metastatic cells, thereby clearing them from the microvasculature and preventing them from establishing a new metastatic tumour.

### The fibrotic and immune microenvironments as targetable drivers of metastasis [^a2b91750]. British Journal of Cancer (2021). Medium credibility.

Fig. 3
The metastatic microenvironment in the liver.

The liver provides a permissive environment for metastatic colonisation. (1) Circulating tumour cells (CTCs) within the liver microvasculature must survive immune attack from circulating immune cell populations. (2) Cells then enter the lumen of the hepatic sinusoid via specialised sieve-like fenestrated endothelial cells (liver sinusoidal endothelial cells; LSECs). (3) Cells are subjected to further immune surveillance mediated via cytokine and chemokine crosstalk between sinusoidal endothelial cells, Kupffer cells and lymphocytes. (4) The tumour cells must then establish themselves within the space of Dissé, where they recruit hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), myeloid-derived suppressor cells and lymphocytes to establish a metastatic-promoting environment required for the initiation of micrometastases. (5) The further outgrowth of metastases is accompanied by matrix deposition and stiffening mediated by activated HSCs and the formation of a local vasculature and recruitment of pro-inflammatory immune cells.

Surmounting the sinusoids

The initiation of metastasis in the liver requires cancer cells to cross the immunologically defensive barrier of endothelial cells and immune cells, and establish themselves within the space of Dissé, a region adjacent to the sinusoid which, in healthy individuals, accommodates HSCs — liver fibroblasts that are central for establishing scar formation following injury (Fig. 3). Somewhat counterintuitively, many of the cell types that are required for immune surveillance and the formation of a physical barrier to prevent metastatic colonisation of the liver are co-opted by cancer cells. Several studies have highlighted the importance of cell adhesion molecules such as integrins and selectins on sinusoidal endothelial cells, which immobilise cancer cells as they move through the sinusoids. This strategy enables the CTCs to delaminate through the endothelial layer of the sinusoid and into the space of Dissé, where they are protected from immediate immune sensing and the processes of tumour cell clearance. –

### Nucleic acid spheres for treating capillarisation of liver sinusoidal endothelial cells in liver fibrosis [^bd3575fa]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

The liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSEC) are indispensable for maintaining the distinctive architecture and functionality of the hepatic sinusoids, which facilitate efficient blood circulation and metabolic exchange. Furthermore, these specialized endothelial cells play an indispensable role in propelling the progression of liver fibrosis. Within the context of this condition, LSEC undergo a transformative process known as capillarization - relinquishing their fenestrations and sieve plate structures while adopting a more dedifferentiated and pro-fibrogenic phenotype. This phenomenon called endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) intensifies the fibrotic mechanism by facilitating extracellular matrix component deposition and augmenting inflammatory cell recruitment. As such, reverting LSEC's capillarization has emerged as an auspicious therapeutic approach to alleviate liver fibrosis and reinstate optimal hepatic functionality.

The transplantation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) has garnered significant attention as an exceedingly promising and arguably the only valid therapeutic approach for reversing liver fibrosis. MSCs possess remarkable immunomodulatory and regenerative properties that can effectively mitigate fibrosis through various mechanisms, including the secretion of paracrine factors and their ability to differentiate into hepatic cell types. In recent years, an increasing body of research has revealed that MSCs possess the ability to reverse the capillarization process of LSEC, thereby reinstating fenestrae in the sinusoidal endothelium and restoring the normal structure and function of liver sinusoids. This process of revascularization not only alleviates fibrosis but also enhances hepatic microcirculation, facilitating overall recovery of liver function. Nevertheless, the clinical translation of stem cell transplantation is impeded by safety concerns such as tumorigenicity and immune rejection, ethical dilemmas associated with cell sourcing, technical complexities in differentiation and transplantation, and exorbitant costs. Hence, revealing the underlying mechanism of MSC in reversing the capillarized LSEC and subsequently developing an alternative approach that can be swiftly translated into clinical practice, while ensuring utmost safety during treatment for liver fibrosis, becomes an imperative task from this point forward.

### Kupffer cells determine intrahepatic traffic of PEGylated liposomal doxorubicin [^8d87bda4]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Intrahepatic accumulation dominates organ distribution for most nanomedicines. However, obscure intrahepatic fate largely hampers regulation on their in vivo performance. Herein, PEGylated liposomal doxorubicin is exploited to clarify the intrahepatic fate of both liposomes and the payload in male mice. Kupffer cells initiate and dominate intrahepatic capture of liposomal doxorubicin, following to deliver released doxorubicin to hepatocytes with zonated distribution along the lobule porto-central axis. Increasing Kupffer cells capture promotes doxorubicin accumulation in hepatocytes, revealing the Kupffer cells capture-payload release-hepatocytes accumulation scheme. In contrast, free doxorubicin is overlooked by Kupffer cells, instead quickly distributing into hepatocytes by directly crossing fenestrated liver sinusoid endothelium. Compared to free doxorubicin, liposomal doxorubicin exhibits sustained metabolism/excretion due to the extra capture-release process. This work unveils the pivotal role of Kupffer cells in intrahepatic traffic of PEGylated liposomal therapeutics, and quantitively describes the intrahepatic transport/distribution/elimination process, providing crucial information for guiding further development of nanomedicines.

### Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells in hepatic fibrosis [^9776989d]. Hepatology (2015). Low credibility.

Capillarization, lack of liver sinusoidal endothelial cell (LSEC) fenestration, and formation of an organized basement membrane not only precedes fibrosis, but is also permissive for hepatic stellate cell activation and fibrosis. Thus, dysregulation of the LSEC phenotype is a critical step in the fibrotic process. Both a vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-stimulated, nitric oxide (NO)-independent pathway and a VEGF-stimulated NO-dependent pathway are necessary to maintain the differentiated LSEC phenotype. The NO-dependent pathway is impaired in capillarization and activation of this pathway downstream from NO restores LSEC differentiation in vivo. Restoration of LSEC differentiation in vivo promotes HSC quiescence, enhances regression of fibrosis, and prevents progression of cirrhosis.

### Semaphorin-3A regulates liver sinusoidal endothelial cell porosity and promotes hepatic steatosis [^48146d4e]. Nature Cardiovascular Research (2024). High credibility.

Main

The liver is a key regulator of lipid metabolism. It receives blood-borne free fatty acids (FFAs), lipoproteins and carbohydrates and utilizes these to produce new triglycerides (TGs), which are packaged and secreted into the bloodstream as very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL). Previous data suggest that the exchange of macromolecules between the blood and hepatocytes is facilitated by highly permeable liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs), which separate the sinusoidal vascular lumen from the microvilli of the hepatocytes –. LSECs typically harbor 50–300 nm-sized fenestrae or pores, which are organized in sieve plates. They are thought to allow a free passage of virtually all macromolecules as well as lipoproteins and their remnants, except for chylomicrons, which are too large. The number of fenestrae and their diameter in LSECs is dynamic, thought to be adapted to physiologic needsand can (at least in vitro) be changed within minutes.

### Platelets: No longer bystanders in liver disease [^0c6793a5]. Hepatology (2016). Low credibility.

The Interaction Between Platelets and Liver Sinusoidal Endothelium Regulates Hepatic Leukocyte Infiltration

Hepatic sinusoids are lined by unique fenestrated endothelial cells, which are exposed to only minimal shear stress 5 and have scavenger‐like functions. 9 The unique phenotype of sinusoidal endothelium characterized by a paucity of P‐selectin expression (both constitutive and inflammation‐induced) and low levels of von Willebrand factor 5 helps to set the hepatic vasculature apart from the majority of other endothelial beds, thus rendering the liver a specialized environment for platelet‐endothelial interactions. The combinations of signals which govern recruitment of immune cells across the sinusoidal bed are distinct from those reported in other solid organs, 5, 10 and platelets may compensate for the lack of expression of attachment factors such as selectins 10 to assist in leukocyte recruitment during inflammation. Studies in viral models of murine hepatitis, 11, 12, 13 human liver regeneration, and ischemia‐reperfusion injury 14 demonstrate platelet sequestration within hepatic sinusoids. In vitro studies with human hepatic sinusoidal endothelial cells (HSECs) demonstrate that platelet adhesion is partly integrin (GPIIb/IIIa and αVβ3)‐mediated, 5 with the precise location of hepatic platelet adhesion varying dependent on the type of injury. For instance in ischemia‐reperfusion injury platelets are selectively sequestered to the periportal and midzonal sinusoidal endothelium. 5 Bound platelets activate isolated HSECs to express chemokine (C‐X‐C motif) ligand 8 (CXCL‐8) and chemokine (C‐C motif) ligand 2 (CCL‐2), thereby promoting neutrophil and lymphocyte recruitment (Fig. 1). 5 Studies in rats have revealed that platelet‐driven leukocyte recruitment results in hepatic damage during systemic endotoxemia and that platelet‐endothelial interactions precede and drive leukocyte adherence. 15 Furthermore, leukocytes themselves can also recruit platelets to the liver. Models of ischemia‐reperfusion injury in mice reveal the ability of cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) T cells to activate endothelial cells, thus driving platelet recruitment to the liver sinusoids (Fig. 1). The end result is a self‐perpetuating cycle of microvascular dysfunction and hepatocellular injury. 16 A schematic summarizing platelet HSECs and lymphocyte interactions is shown in Fig. 1.

### Drug-induced liver injury: premarketing clinical evaluation… [^f859fc2c]. FDA (2019). Medium credibility.

- **Docket Number**:
- FDA-2008-D-0128
- **Issued by**: This guidance is intended to assist the pharmaceutical industry and other investigators who are conducting new drug development in assessing the potential for a drug2 to cause severe liver injury. In particular, the guidance addresses how laboratory measurements that signal the potential for such druginduced liver injury can be obtained and evaluated during drug development. This evaluation is important because most drugs that cause severe DILI do so infrequently; typical drug development databases with up to a few thousand subjects exposed to a new drug will not show any cases. Databases may, however, show evidence or signals of a drug's potential for severe DILI if the clinical and laboratory data are properly evaluated for evidence of lesser injury that may not be severe, but may predict the ability to cause more severe injuries.

This guidance describes an approach that can be used to distinguish signals of DILI that identify drugs likely to cause severe liver injury from signals that do not suggest such a potential. This guidance does not address issues of preclinical evaluation for signals of DILI, nor the detection and assessment of DILI after drug approval and marketing.

### Spatial metabolomics and its application in the liver [^5f11e37e]. Hepatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Liver lobules are hexagonal-shaped anatomical functional units, centered on a branch of the hepatic vein called the central vein (CV). The portal triads are located in the hexagonal corners and the junction with the neighboring lobules, and are formed by PV, the hepatic arteriole, and bile ducts. Liver lobules are composed of concentric layers of hepatocytes distributed into hepatic cords and containing two intertwined radially distributed networks, the sinusoids for blood flow and the bile canaliculi for bile flux and secretion. In the basolateral domains, hepatocytes face fenestrated liver sinusoidal endothelial cells that form the radial sinusoidal blood vessels. HSCs, the primary cell type involved in fibrosis, reside in the "space of Disse" between the hepatocytes and sinusoids. In contrast, KCs, the liver-resident macrophages, are largely immotile cells in the sinusoids. Liver lobules can be further divided into 3 zones: the region surrounding the portal triads is called periportal (zone 1), hepatocytes adjacent to the CV are known as pericentral (zone 3), and the regions in between are referred to as midlobular (zone 2)(Figure 1 A). Alternatively, another way to conceptualize the microscopic structure of the liver lobe is by dividing them into portal lobules, centered in the portal triads instead of the CV, or dividing them into acini, the functional units in terms of blood flow. The acinus contains a small portal tract at the center and terminal hepatic venules at the periphery. The liver acinus was first divided by Rappaport into zones 1, 2, and 3, wherein zone 1 surrounds the portal tract and zone 3 surrounds the hepatic venule. Acinar zones 1, 2, and 3 correspond to the periportal, middle, and pericentral zones of the lobule. As blood flows inward from the periportal region to the pericentral region, hepatocytes take up and secrete nutrients and sense hormones. Sequential hepatocyte consumption and production, together with local tissue morphogens, give rise to a graded microenvironment of oxygen concentrations, nutrients, and signaling along the PV-CV axis and create different radial layers of subspecialized hepatocytes, a phenomenon termed zonation. Liver metabolic zonation is a highly regulated process critical for optimal liver function by maintaining energy homeostasis, regulating the metabolism of nutrients and xenobiotics, and controlling the production, regulation, and recycling of various proteins.

### Altered AKAP12 expression in portal fibroblasts and liver sinusoids mediates transition from hepatic fibrogenesis to fibrosis resolution [^22f5992c]. Experimental & Molecular Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Liver fibrosis is the final outcome of chronic hepatic damage caused by multiple etiologies, such as virus infections, alcohol over-consumption, and autoimmune or metabolic diseases. In cirrhosis — the end stage of liver fibrosis — liver malfunction with severe complications arises due to the distortion of liver architecture caused by aberrant extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition. However, an important characteristic of liver fibrosis that can provide new therapeutic strategies is its reversibility, even at an advanced stage, upon removal of the causative injury.

Hepatic non-parenchymal cells are involved not only in fibrogenesis but also in fibrosis resolution. Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) and portal fibroblasts (PFs) are mesenchymal cells capable of transforming into myofibroblasts that aberrantly produce ECM proteins under fibrogenic conditions. These cells are removed by apoptosisor senescenceduring fibrosis resolution; however, some remain in a quiescent state. The molecular mechanisms underlying the transition from fibrogenesis to fibrosis resolution are not fully understood; however, shifting the balance between pro-fibrotic pathways, such as TGF-β1 and PDGF signaling, and anti-fibrotic ones, such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) and cAMP pathways –, may mediate this transition.

Under fibrotic conditions, liver sinusoids undergo vascular remodeling, which includes angiogenesis and capillarization characterized by the loss of fenestrae and the formation of basement membrane. As differentiated liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) function to maintain the quiescent status of HSCs, loss of LSEC differentiation under fibrosis contributes to HSC activation. Forced re-differentiation of LSECs by a soluble guanylate cyclase activator promotes fibrosis regression in rodent models, suggesting that the normalization of LSECs to their differentiated state is a prerequisite for proper liver fibrosis resolution.

AKAP12 is a scaffold protein known to integrate effector proteins such as protein kinase A, protein kinase C, and protein phosphatase 2B for the β-adrenergic receptor pathway, through which it has a role in regulating cAMP compartmentalization and the re-sensitization of β-adrenergic receptors. As AKAP12 is widely expressed by several cell types, it is reported to have diverse physiological functions, such as inhibition of angiogenesis, promotion of meningeal reconstruction, and tumor suppression. In connection to chronic liver diseases, AKAP12 is reported to be downregulated by an epigenetic mechanism in human hepatocellular carcinoma. However, little is known regarding its expression and function in normal and fibrotic livers.

### Cell-to-cell and organ-to-organ crosstalk in the pathogenesis of alcohol-associated liver disease [^4522fff5]. Egastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells

LSECs, the most abundant non-parenchymal cells in the liver, form the vascular bed of the liver and play a critical role in maintaining hepatic homeostasis. Their unique structural features, including the presence of fenestrae and the absence of a basement membrane, facilitate the selective filtration of blood components and ensure efficient exchange between the bloodstream and liver parenchymal cells. These fenestrae are essential for maintaining liver function, as they allow macromolecules to pass freely between the blood and hepatocytes, facilitating nutrient and waste exchange.

Beyond their physical filtration role, LSECs serve several functional roles, including scavenging bloodborne molecules, regulating immune responses and maintaining HSC quiescence, which prevents excessive liver fibrosis. These functions are critical for overall liver health and are essential for preventing liver diseases, such as fibrosis and cirrhosis, particularly in conditions like metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD).LSECs are also involved in the metabolism of various substances, including ethanol, through the expression of key enzymes such as ADH1 and CYP2E1. While much research has focused on the role of LSECs in MASLD, their involvement in ALD is less well understood and requires further exploration. In ALD, LSECs metabolise ethanol primarily through CYP2E1, which is upregulated on ethanol exposure. This ethanol metabolism in LSECs leads to a decrease in nitric oxide (NO) production, largely due to alterations in the acetylation of heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) and its interaction with endothelial nitric oxide synthase. Importantly, studies suggest that blocking Hsp90 acetylation may restore NO production and improve LSEC function.

In addition to ethanol metabolism, LSECs are implicated in the progression of fibrosis and inflammation in liver diseases. For instance, capillarisation of LSECs, characterised by the loss of fenestrae and the development of a basement membrane, has been observed in liver diseases such as metabolic-associated steatohepatitis and AH. Inducing apoptosis in capillarised LSECs has been shown to reduce fibrosis and inflammation in murine models, highlighting the significance of maintaining LSEC integrity to prevent disease progression.

One of the key regulators of redox homeostasis and inflammation in LSECs is TXNIP, which is significantly elevated in both patients and murine models of ALD.TXNIP modulates the inflammatory response and plays a pivotal role in ethanol-induced liver injury. Specific knockout of TXNIP in LSECs leads to sinusoidal capillarisation, reduced NO production and increased inflammation, thereby aggravating liver injury, fibrosis and HCC development in ALD. Conversely, overexpression of TXNIP reverses these effects.

### Role of liver sinusoidal endothelial cells in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease [^7e072d3d]. Journal of Hepatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and its complications are an expanding health problem associated with the metabolic syndrome. Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) are highly specialized endothelial cells localized at the interface between the blood derived from the gut and the adipose tissue on the one side, and other liver cells on the other side. In physiological conditions, LSECs are gatekeepers of liver homeostasis. LSECs display anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrogenic properties by preventing Kupffer cell and hepatic stellate cell activation and regulating intrahepatic vascular resistance and portal pressure. This review focusses on changes occurring in LSECs in NAFLD and on their consequences on NAFLD progression and complications. Capillarization, namely the loss of LSEC fenestrae, and LSEC dysfunction, namely the loss of the ability of LSECs to generate vasodilator agents in response to increased shear stress both occur early in NAFLD. These LSEC changes favour steatosis development and set the stage for NAFLD progression. At the stage of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, altered LSECs release inflammatory mediators and contribute to the recruitment of inflammatory cells, thus promoting liver injury and inflammation. Altered LSECs also fail to maintain hepatic stellate cell quiescence and release fibrogenic mediators, including Hedgehog signalling molecules, promoting liver fibrosis. Liver angiogenesis is increased in NAFLD and contributes to liver inflammation and fibrosis, but also to hepatocellular carcinoma development. Thus, improving LSEC health appears to be a promising approach to prevent NAFLD progression and complications.

### Species differences in transgene DNA uptake in hepatocytes after adenoviral transfer correlate with the size of endothelial fenestrae [^7c010c04]. Gene Therapy (2007). Low credibility.

Sinusoidal fenestrae may restrict the transport of gene transfer vectors according to their size. Using Vitrobot technology and cryo-electron microscopy, we show that the diameter of human adenoviral serotype 5 vectors is 93 nm with protruding fibers of 30 nm. Thus, a diameter of fenestrae of 150 nm or more is likely to be sufficient for passage of vectors from the sinusoidal lumen to the space of Disse and subsequent uptake of vectors in hepatocytes. The average diameter of fenestrae in New Zealand White rabbits (103 ± 1.3 nm) was 1.4-fold (P < 0.0001) lower than in C57BL/6 mice (141 ± 5.4 nm). The percentage of sinusoidal fenestrae with a diameter larger than 150 nm was 10-fold (P < 0.01) lower in rabbits (3.2 ± 0.24%) than in C57BL/6 mice (32 ± 5%), and this resulted in 8.8-fold (P = 0.01) lower transgene DNA levels in hepatocytes in rabbits after adenoviral transfer. Injection of N-acetylcysteine combined with transient liver ischemia preceding intraportal transfer in rabbits increased the percentage of sinusoidal fenestrae above 150 nm 2.0-fold (P < 0.001) and increased transgene DNA levels in hepatocytes 6.6-fold (P < 0.05). In conclusion, species differences in transgene DNA uptake in hepatocytes after adenoviral transfer correlate with the diameter of fenestrae.

### Pathology of the liver sinusoids [^1f6d2f9a]. Histopathology (2014). Low credibility.

The hepatic sinusoids comprise a complex of vascular conduits to transport blood from the porta hepatis to the inferior vena cava through the liver. Under normal conditions, portal venous and hepatic artery pressures are equalized within the sinusoids, oxygen and nutrients from the systemic circulation are delivered to the parenchymal cells and differentially distributed throughout the liver acini, and proteins of liver derivation are carried into the cardiac/systemic circulation. Liver sinusoid structures are lined by endothelial cells unique to their location, and Kupffer cells. Multifunctional hepatic stellate cells and various immune active cells are localized within the space of Disse between the sinusoid and the adjacent hepatocytes. Flow within the sinusoids can be compromised by physical or pressure blockage in their lumina as well as obstructive processes within the space of Disse. The intimate relationship of the liver sinusoids to neighbouring hepatocytes is a significant factor affecting the health of hepatocytes, or transmission of the effects of injury within the sinusoidal space. Pathologists should recognize several patterns of injury involving the sinusoids and surrounding hepatocytes. In this review, injury, alterations and accumulations within the liver sinusoids are illustrated and discussed.

### Extracellular vesicles targeting non-parenchymal cells: the therapeutical effect on liver fibrosis [^79ed9554]. Egastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Targeting LSECs in liver fibrosis

During the development of liver fibrosis, the capillarisation of LSECs restricts substance exchange between the blood and the Disse space. This capillarisation accelerates HSC activation and fibrosis progression. To address this issue, a systemic strategy for liver fibrosis treatment has been developed. The first step involves restoring the function of LSECs in therapeutic transport through the liver sinusoid.

Two approaches have been explored for this purpose. The first approach involves using an sGC stimulator called riociguat or LSEC-targeting and fenestrae-repairing nanoparticles (HA-NPs/SMV). These interventions aim to repair the fenestrae (pores) in LSECs, allowing better access for antifibrosis agents or nanoparticles targeting HSCs to enter the Disse space. This can inhibit HSC proliferation, reduce collagen deposition and degrade deposited collagen.

Targeted drug delivery systems have also been developed using modified peptides. For instance, a peptide-lipid conjugate has been designed to efficiently deliver molecules to LSECs. Peptide-modified PEG-liposomes (RLTR35) demonstrate potential for delivering drugs specifically to LSECs, offering a feasible approach for treating liver fibrosis. These modified peptides enhance the specificity and effectiveness of drug delivery to LSECs, allowing for targeted treatment of liver fibrosis.

Although EVs targeting LSECs have hardly been reported, the thoughts above can be used in the development of them. For example, RLTR peptide attached EVs are supposed to target LSECs in theory and our team is trying to testify it and create EVs with LSECs targeting function.

Targeting non-parenchymal cells provides a promising treatment for liver fibrosis due to particular types of EVs working in targeted cells and finally to alleviate liver fibrosis (figure 4, table 2).

Figure 4
Therapeutic effects of targeted extracellular vesicles (EVs) in non-parenchymal cells. After treatments of EVs, proliferation, chemotaxis and profibrogenic signals of activated HSCs decrease while expression of antifibrotic miRNA and apoptosis increase. As for KCs, their polarisation changes and expression of Notch declines while CD73 and CD5L raise. LSECs restore their fenestrae function and therapeutic agent or nanoparticles are allowed to access the space of Disse to play a role.

### Protein phosphatases regulate the liver microenvironment in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma [^ce326b4b]. Experimental & Molecular Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Fig. 1
Model of liver regeneration or HCC development by hepatic progenitor cell expansion or hepatocyte dedifferentiation following liver injury/damage.

a The liver consists of hexagonal liver lobules. b In the normal liver, regeneration occurs by compensatory proliferation of hepatic progenitor cells. However, in chronic liver diseases, dedifferentiation of mature hepatocytes can be induced. Tumor-initiating cells can promote the development of HCC through oncogenic proliferation.

Although immune cells maintain liver homeostasis in a steady state, they can create a proinflammatory liver microenvironment by secreting proinflammatory cytokines and promoting the recruitment of inflammatory immune cells to sites of liver injury. Activated HSCs in a proinflammatory liver microenvironment can induce ECM deposition of collagen fiber and promote hepatic cirrhosis, which is a late-stage liver disease. Excess ECM deposition can disrupt the hepatic architecture and induce capillarization of hepatic sinusoids, into which the fenestrae of LSECs shrink and disappear and a subcutaneous basement membrane is formed –. Hepatic sinusoidal capillarization reduces blood flow following increased vesicular resistance and causes hypoxia in the liver microenvironment. Hypoxia induces angiogenesis and activates immune suppressive cells such as MDSCs and regulatory T cells (Tregs), contributing to a protumoral liver microenvironment. Hence, the hepatic architecture plays a critical role in the function and interaction of liver cells. It is highly involved in HCC progression by transitioning the liver microenvironment.

### Semaphorin-3A regulates liver sinusoidal endothelial cell porosity and promotes hepatic steatosis [^a2a6279b]. Nature Cardiovascular Research (2024). High credibility.

Prevalence of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), formerly known as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, increases worldwide and associates with type 2 diabetes and other cardiometabolic diseases. Here we demonstrate that Sema3a is elevated in liver sinusoidal endothelial cells of animal models for obesity, type 2 diabetes and MASLD. In primary human liver sinusoidal endothelial cells, saturated fatty acids induce expression of SEMA3A, and loss of a single allele is sufficient to reduce hepatic fat content in diet-induced obese mice. We show that semaphorin-3A regulates the number of fenestrae through a signaling cascade that involves neuropilin-1 and phosphorylation of cofilin-1 by LIM domain kinase 1. Finally, inducible vascular deletion of Sema3a in adult diet-induced obese mice reduces hepatic fat content and elevates very low-density lipoprotein secretion. Thus, we identified a molecular pathway linking hyperlipidemia to microvascular defenestration and early development of MASLD.

### Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells: friend or foe in metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease / metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis [^d9f0ef11]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is the predominant liver disease and is becoming the paramount contributor to end-stage liver disease and liver-related deaths. Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) located between the hepatic parenchyma and blood from viscera and gastrointestinal tract are the gatekeepers for the hepatic microenvironment and normal function. In normal physiological conditions, LSECs govern the substance exchange between hepatic parenchyma and blood through dynamic regulation of fenestration and maintain the quiescent state of Kupffer cells (KCs) and hepatic stellate cells. In MASLD, lipotoxicity, insulin resistance, gastrointestinal microbiota dysbiosis, and mechanical compression caused by fat-laden hepatocytes result in LSECs capillarization and dysfunction. The altered LSECs progressively shift from healer to injurer, exacerbating liver inflammation and advancing liver fibrosis. This review focuses on the deteriorative roles of LSECs and related molecular mechanisms involved in MASLD and their contribution to metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) and liver fibrosis development and progression. Furthermore, in this review, we propose that targeting LSECs dysfunction is a prospective therapeutic strategy to restore the physiological function of LSECs and mitigate MASLD progression.

### P130Cas, crk-associated substrate plays essential roles in liver development by regulating sinusoidal endothelial cell fenestration [^3441a6bc]. Hepatology (2010). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

p130Cas, Crk-associated substrate (Cas), is an adaptor/scaffold protein that plays a central role in actin cytoskeletal reorganization. We previously showed that mice in which Cas was deleted (Cas(-/-)) died in utero because of early cardiovascular maldevelopment. To further investigate the in vivo roles of Cas, we generated mice with a hypomorphic Cas allele lacking the exon 2-derived region (Cas(Deltaex2/Deltaex2)), which encodes Src homology domain 3 (SH3) of Cas. Cas(Deltaex2/Deltaex2) mice again died as embryos, but they particularly showed progressive liver degeneration with hepatocyte apoptosis. Because Cas expression in the liver is preferentially detected in sinusoidal endothelial cells (SECs), the observed hepatocyte apoptosis was most likely ascribable to impaired function of SECs. To address this possibility, we stably introduced a Cas mutant lacking the SH3 domain (Cas DeltaSH3) into an SEC line (NP31). Intriguingly, the introduction of Cas DeltaSH3 induced a loss of fenestrae, the characteristic cell-penetrating pores in SECs that serve as a critical route for supplying oxygen and nutrients to hepatocytes. The disappearance of fenestrae in Cas DeltaSH3-expressing cells was associated with an attenuation of actin stress fiber formation, a marked reduction in tyrosine phosphorylation of Cas, and defective binding of Cas to CrkII.

Conclusion

Cas plays pivotal roles in liver development through the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and formation of fenestrae in SECs.

### Semaphorin-3A regulates liver sinusoidal endothelial cell porosity and promotes hepatic steatosis [^dffa53f3]. Nature Cardiovascular Research (2024). High credibility.

The porosity of LSECs is reduced in liver tissue of aged mice and rats showing age-related capillarization of sinusoids, which is called 'pseudocapillarization' and is characterized by LSEC thickening, basement membrane formation and defenestration (loss of fenestrae). Most notably, pseudocapillarization and defenestration are observed in chronic liver diseases, including MASLD, previously known as 'non-alcoholic fatty liver disease' (NAFLD), and may precede more severe stages of MASLD, including fibrosis and inflammation, culminating in metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), previously known as 'non-alcoholic steatohepatitis' (NASH) –. For example, in mice fed with a choline-deficient-amino acid-defined diet, LSEC porosity (the ratio of fenestrae area to total cell area) declines before severe steatosis with 'ballooning hepatocytes'. Moreover, a rise in the blood concentration of palmitic acid correlates with a reduced porosity of LSECs in high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice. Information about LSEC porosity and defenestration in individuals with MASLD is still scarce, even though a recent study reported less defenestration in liver biopsies from human individuals with MASH compared to those with MASLD, but without MASH, indicating that defenestration preferentially takes place during an early stage of MASLD. It can be speculated that defenestration of LSEC reduces the export of VLDL from the liver (possibly contributing to hepatic steatosis) and prevents hepatic removal of chylomicron remnants from the bloodstream (possibly contributing to hyperlipidemia), thus triggering early development of MASLD; however, the molecular basis of LSEC defenestration and its contribution to MASLD, including genetic triggers of defenestration, are largely unknown.

### FDA warns about rare occurrence of serious liver injury with use of… [^35b531c1]. FDA (2019). Medium credibility.

In many of the reported cases, liver failure occurred in patients who had signs and symptoms of moderate to severe liver impairment or other serious liver problems and should not have been treated with these medicines. In some cases, patients were reported to have no cirrhosis or compensated cirrhosis with mild liver impairment despite having evidence of decreased platelets at baseline or an increase in the pressure within the portal vein that carries blood from the digestive organs to the liver. In addition, some cases had other significant pre-existing risk factors such as liver cancer, alcohol abuse, or serious medical illnesses associated with serious liver problems. These factors may have contributed to clinical worsening of liver function or liver failure during treatment with these hepatitis C medicines. In most cases, liver failure or decompensation typically occurred within the first 4 weeks of starting treatment.

We will continue to monitor this safety concern and will communicate any new information to the public if it becomes available.
- Genotype 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 infection and have previously been treated with an HCV regimen containing an NS5A inhibitor
- Genotype 1a or 3 infection and have previously been treated with an HCV regimen containing sofosbuvir without an NS5A inhibitor.
- In many of the reported cases, liver failure occurred in patients who had signs and symptoms of advanced liver disease or other serious liver problems and should not have been treated with these medicines. In some cases, patients were reported as having no liver impairment or mild liver impairment at baseline despite having evidence of a previous decompensation event, portal hypertension or decreased platelets at baseline.

In addition, some cases had other significant pre-existing risk factors such as hepatocellular carcinoma, alcohol abuse, or serious medical illnesses associated with serious liver problems. The median time to onset of a liver-related event or liver decompensation after initiating treatment was 22 days, ranging from 2 days to 16 weeks. The most frequently reported liver-related events were hyperbilirubinemia, jaundice, ascites, and hepatic encephalopathy. Discontinuation of the drug resulted in resolution of symptoms or reduced liver biochemical values in 39 of the 63 cases, and there were two cases of recurrence of symptoms upon re-initiating treatment.

### ALK1 controls hepatic vessel formation, angiodiversity, and angiocrine functions in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia of the liver [^ca98b73c]. Hepatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Investigating HHT and ALK1 signaling in preclinical models is challenging due to the high mortality that has been observed. Therefore, most preclinical models have to be used at very early time points after HHT induction, and ex vivo systems such as the retina are preferred. Notably, vascular malformations of the liver are not covered well by currently available mouse models.

The vascular system of the liver is highly complex featuring hepatic arteries and veins, portal vessels, and a special microvascular bed, i.e. the hepatic sinusoids. The hepatic sinusoids are lined by LSEC, a discontinuous variety of endothelial cells (EC) featuring wide transcellular pores called fenestrae.LSEC lack a continuous basement membrane, but they are embedded in extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins in the space of Disse that extends from the abluminal side of LSEC to the luminal pole of hepatocytes. LSEC are not only morphologically distinct EC, but they exert specialized functions in regulating liver immunity and inflammation, and by clearing a variety of blood factors from the circulation via endocytic receptors, such as the mannose receptor, CD32b, lymphatic vessel endothelial hyaluronan receptor 1 (LYVE‐1), Stabilin‐1, and Stabilin‐2 (Stab2). In addition, the microvascular niche of the liver sinusoids comprises Kupffer cells, i.e. sinusoidal macrophages, and hepatic stellate cells, which store vitamin A and may transdifferentiate upon liver injury to myofibroblasts, developing a cytoskeleton rich in alpha smooth muscle actin (ACTA2).

With its dual blood supply and its highly specialized sinusoidal microvascular niche, the liver vasculature represents a paradigm of organotypic and segmental angiodiversity. Previously, we have shown that microvascular angiodiversity in the liver depends on a special LSEC differentiation program controlled by transcription factor GATA‐4. GATA‐4–dependent organ‐specific endothelial differentiation controls liver development and embryonic hematopoiesis. In the adult liver, LSEC control liver function and hepatic fibrogenesis by paracrine signaling via organotypic angiocrine factors. In particular, loss of portmanteau of the names Wingless and Int‐1 (Wnt) factors disrupts metabolic liver zonation, whereas de novo expression of endothelial platelet‐derived growth factor (PDGF) promotes stellate cell activation and fibrogenesis upon endothelial GATA‐4 deficiency in the adult liver. Within the hepatic vascular niche, however, the role of endothelial ALK1 signaling has not yet been comprehensively analyzed.

### Hedgehog signalling regulates liver sinusoidal endothelial cell capillarisation [^c5e424a1]. Gut (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

Vascular remodelling during liver damage involves loss of healthy liver sinusoidal endothelial cell (LSEC) phenotype via capillarisation. Hedgehog (Hh) signalling regulates vascular development and increases during liver injury. This study therefore examined its role in capillarisation.

Design

Primary LSEC were cultured for 5 days to induce capillarisation. Pharmacological, antibody-mediated and genetic approaches were used to manipulate Hh signalling. Effects on mRNA and protein expression of Hh-regulated genes and capillarisation markers were evaluated by quantitative reverse transcription PCR and immunoblot. Changes in LSEC function were assessed by migration and tube forming assay, and gain/loss of fenestrae was examined by electron microscopy. Mice with acute or chronic liver injury were treated with Hh inhibitors; effects on capillarisation were assessed by immunohistochemistry.

Results

Freshly isolated LSEC expressed Hh ligands, Hh receptors and Hh ligand antagonist Hhip. Capillarisation was accompanied by repression of Hhip and increased expression of Hh-regulated genes. Treatment with Hh agonist further induced expression of Hh ligands and Hh-regulated genes, and upregulated capillarisation-associated genes; whereas Hh signalling antagonist or Hh ligand neutralising antibody each repressed expression of Hh target genes and capillarisation markers. LSEC isolated from Smo(loxP/loxP) transgenic mice that had been infected with adenovirus expressing Cre-recombinase to delete Smoothened showed over 75% knockdown of Smoothened. During culture, Smoothened-deficient LSEC had inhibited Hh signalling, less induction of capillarisation-associated genes and retention of fenestrae. In mice with injured livers, inhibiting Hh signalling prevented capillarisation.

Conclusions

LSEC produce and respond to Hh ligands, and use Hh signalling to regulate complex phenotypic changes that occur during capillarisation.

### Semaphorin-3A regulates liver sinusoidal endothelial cell porosity and promotes hepatic steatosis [^60e6ff13]. Nature Cardiovascular Research (2024). High credibility.

Source data

Notably, heterozygous deletion of Sema3a increased fenestrae frequency by 14% compared to wild-type littermates (Fig. 6b), whereas the fenestrae diameter was only slightly increased (Fig. 6c). This added up to an increase of 22% in LSEC porosity in Sema3a +/ − mice compared to their wild-type littermate controls (Fig. 6d). We then compared these results to LSEC fenestration of 10-week-old db/db and db /+ control mice (Fig. 6e), as LSECs from db/db mice at around this age (12 weeks) had a close to fourfold increase in Sema3a expression (Fig. 1d). Conversely to Sema3a +/ − mice, db/db mice displayed a numeric decrease in fenestrae frequency and diameter (Fig. 6f, g), leading to a 36% reduction of LSEC porosity in db/db versus db /+ liver tissue (Fig. 6h). In addition, LSEC porosity negatively correlated with body weight and blood glucose concentrations (Fig. 6i–k). We conclude that in obese, diabetic mice, LSEC porosity is reduced, but that deletion of just one Sema3a allele even in non-diabetic mice increases LSEC porosity in a haplo-insufficient manner.

### A hepatic network of dendritic cells mediates CD4 T cell help outside lymphoid organs [^7683ee2a]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

It is interesting to note that although portal tracts contain professional APCs and are able to facilitate the transfer of CD4 help to CD8 + T cells, they do not possess all the properties generally associated with SLOs. The main differences are not only structural (extended vs compact compartment), but also relate to anatomical and vascular differences that dictate distinct rules of T cell access and egress. Portal tracts form a compartment continuous with the space of Disse, the intercellular area separating hepatocytes from the fenestrated sinusoidal endothelium, which lacks a basement membrane. This unique anatomy allows antigens derived from hepatocytes and the blood circulation to easily access portal tracts where they could be captured and cross-presented by resident cDC1s. However, the late accumulation of cognate CD8 + T cells in portal tracts observed in this work would suggest that it is antigen-experienced rather than naïve CD8 + T cells that encounter antigen in this compartment. Naïve T cells are too large to passively go through LSEC fenestrations and are unlikely to express the chemokine receptors and adhesion molecules that would allow efficient migration through LSECs. Consequently, while naïve T cells circulating in the blood continuously traffic through SLOs after trans-endothelial migration through HEVs or via the lymph circulation, their inability to cross the sinusoidal and portal endothelial barrier makes it unlikely that they access the space of Disse and portal tracts. As T cells undergo activation, they acquire the ability to cross endothelial barriers. Thus, while SLOs can be considered as the main site of T cell priming that support both primary and secondary activation of naïve and central memory T cells respectively, portal tracts likely exclusively support re-activation of effector and memory T cells in the periphery, amplifying the CD8 + T cell response by further expanding the pool of CD8 + T cells that were initially activated in lymphoid tissues.

### A liver immune rheostat regulates CD8 T cell immunity in chronic HBV infection [^f3b691be]. Nature (2024). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

Chronic infection with HBV arises from the failure of virus-specific immunity to control viral replication and eliminate virus-infected hepatocytes. Here we demonstrate that LSECs act as a liver immune rheostat which curbs the effector function of those virus-specific CD8 T cells recognizing their antigen on infected hepatocytes by rendering them dysfunctional through increased cAMP–PKA signalling. Enhanced cAMP–PKA signalling activates the kinase Csk and activated Csk, in turn, inhibits Lck, which shuts down TCR signalling –. This process may contribute to the scarcity and loss-of-function of HBV-specific T cells in the liver because it deprives them of the activation signals necessary for proliferation and expansion, cytokine production and execution of specific cytotoxicity against HBV-infected hepatocytes. The unique micro-architecture of the liver, in which virus-specific CD8 T cells remain in sinusoidal vessels and reach through endothelial fenestrae to contact virus-infected hepatocytes, enforces the close physical contact of T cells with LSECs that increase T cell adenylyl cyclase activity and consequently inhibitory cAMP–PKA signalling. This process, which selectively, locally and dynamically induces the inhibitory cAMP axis in those virus-specific T cells, which engage in close contact with LSECs while they recognize their antigen on hepatocytes, may serve as a physiological mechanism to protect the liver from immune-mediated pathology but also favouring viral persistence at the same time. These roles are underscored by human HBV data which show higher CREM activity in HBV-specific CXCR6 + CD8 T cells in patients with active hepatitis and less CREM activity with increasing viral control and absence of liver damage.

### The effects of oxidative stress on the liver sieve [^2a718aaa]. Journal of Hepatology (2004). Low credibility.

Background/Aims

Oxidative stress is implicated in the pathogenesis of age-related and disease-associated changes in the hepatic sinusoid. We studied the effects of oxidative stress on the morphology of the liver, focusing specifically on the hepatic sinusoidal endothelium (the 'liver sieve').

Methods

The effects of tert-butyl hydroperoxide on the intact liver and isolated sinusoidal endothelial cells were assessed by electron microscopy, immunohistochemistry and biochemical analysis.

Results

Immunohistochemistry revealed a dose-dependent increase in peri-sinusoidal 3-nitrotyrosine staining, particularly in the regions adjacent to the portal triads. Electron microscopy showed dose-dependent formation of large intracellular gaps in the sinusoidal endothelium with reduction in the diameter of the remaining endothelial fenestrations. Activated Kupffer cells extending processes through the fenestrations to contact hepatocytes were noted. Biochemical analysis of total liver tissue showed no significant changes in malondialdehyde content but a decrease in the ratio of GSH to GSSG. tert-Butyl hydroperoxide administered directly onto isolated liver sinusoidal endothelial cells was associated with similar gap formation, indicating a direct effect on the endothelial cells by tert-butyl hydroperoxide.

Conclusions

Oxidative stress selectively damages hepatic sinusoidal endothelial cells. This has implications for those processes associated with changes in the sinusoidal endothelium such as ageing, cirrhosis and exposure to hepatotoxins.

### Extracellular vesicles targeting non-parenchymal cells: the therapeutical effect on liver fibrosis [^40e72971]. Egastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells

LSECs are specialised endothelial cells (EC) in the liver with distinct morphology and functions. Morphologically, LSECs feature fenestrae (pores) of 100–150 nm size, enabling exchange between the sinusoidal blood and Disse space. Functionally, LSECs exhibit a high capacity for endocytosis due to various endocytosis receptors such as collagen-α-chain/mannose receptor, hyaluronan/scavenger receptor and FccIIb2 receptor.

During sustained hepatic injury, LSECs undergo phenotypic changes and lose their protective properties, contributing to liver fibrosis progression. In response to liver injury, LSECs transform into capillarised LSECs characterised by the loss of fenestrae and LSEC markers. This process is facilitated by upregulated endothelial Notch signalling, which inhibits endogenous nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) transcription and leads to Delta-like ligand 4 overexpression. Vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 expression activation further promotes LSEC capillarisation by activating YAP1 protein. Additionally, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) secreted by HSCs and hepatocytes helps maintain LSEC phenotype through nitric oxide (NO)-dependent and NO-independent pathways. In detail, VEGF stimulates NO release from eNOS in LSEC. NO in turn acts through soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC), conversion of GTP to cGMP and stimulation of protein kinase G, which can then phosphorylate protein targets and maintain LSEC phenotype. Single-cell transcriptomics studies have revealed the spatial distribution of heterogeneous liver ECs in normal and cirrhotic mouse livers. Capillarisation-associated genes and ECM genes were found to be upregulated in LSECs of zone 3 in cirrhotic mice, while expression of endocytic receptors decreased. Transcription factors involved in NO production, such as Kruppel-like factor (Klf)2, Klf4 and activator protein 1, were downregulated. As a result of phenotypic transition, LSECs lose their antifibrotic capacities and directly or indirectly participate in fibrosis. They secrete ECM components in response to TGF-β1, contributing to fibrosis initiation. Capillarisation occurs prior to HSC activation and disrupts metabolic interchange while exacerbating hepatocyte hypoxia. Furthermore, dedifferentiated LSECs play a role in generating the inflammatory milieu and altering intrahepatic immunity, promoting fibrosis.

### Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD): mechanisms, clinical implications and therapeutic advances [^ec094f23]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

FIGURE 1
Diverse liver cell types cooperatively drive health and contribute to MASLD pathogenesis. (A) In healthy liver tissue, distinct parenchymal (hepatocytes) and non‐parenchymal (Kupffer, hepatic stellate, liver sinusoidal endothelial and cholangiocytes) cell types coordinate essential functions, including energy metabolism, detoxification, immune surveillance and protein and bile acid synthesis. (B) During MASLD progression, all major liver cell types undergo pathological changes. Hepatocytes accumulate fat and become inflamed and injured. Kupffer cells and hepatic stellate cells are activated, promoting inflammation and fibrosis through cytokine secretion and extracellular matrix deposition. Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells lose their fenestrations (capillarisation) and develop basement membranes, impairing nutrient and oxygen exchange. Cholangiocytes expand and remodel, contributing to ductular reactions and disease progression.

MASLD, formerly known as non‐alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), represents a spectrum of liver pathologies characterised by excessive fat accumulation in hepatocytes in the absence of significant alcohol consumption, and is associated with metabolic syndrome (defined as the presence of at least three of: elevated waist circumference, impaired fasting glucose, hypertension, hypertriglyceridemia or low HDL cholesterol) (Figure 2). The recent shift in nomenclature from NAFLD to MASLD reflects a more accurate framing of the condition as a metabolic disorder, centering diagnostic criteria on metabolic dysfunction rather than exclusion of alcohol use. This reclassification aims to improve diagnostic clarity and align with emerging evidence linking liver disease to systemic metabolic derangements. A subset of MASLD patients develops metabolic dysfunction‐associated steatohepatitis (MASH), formerly known as non‐alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), a more severe form of the disease marked by hepatic inflammation and fibrosis, which significantly increases the risk of progression to cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

FIGURE 2
Transition from NAFLD/NASH to MASLD/MASH nomenclature. Updated terminology for fatty liver disease, reflecting the shift from exclusion‐based definitions (NAFLD and NASH) to a framework grounded in metabolic dysfunction (MASLD and MASH).

Both genetic and metabolic factors impact MASLD progression and severity. For example, cardiometabolic diseases, which comprise a constellation of obesity, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia and hypertension, are well‐established drivers of MASLD progression. Insulin resistance promotes hepatic lipogenesis (excessive fatty acid synthesis) and impairs lipid clearance, while dyslipidemia exacerbates hepatic fat deposition. Systemic hypertension also further contributes to disease progression through vascular inflammatory mechanisms.

### Bone morphogenetic protein 9 is a paracrine factor controlling liver sinusoidal endothelial cell fenestration and protecting against hepatic fibrosis [^85e46bf0]. Hepatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Bone morphogenetic protein 9 (BMP9) is a circulating factor produced by hepatic stellate cells that plays a critical role in vascular quiescence through its endothelial receptor activin receptor-like kinase 1 (ALK1). Mutations in the gene encoding ALK1 cause hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia type 2, a rare genetic disease presenting hepatic vessel malformations. Variations of both the circulating levels and the hepatic mRNA levels of BMP9 have been recently associated with various forms of hepatic fibrosis. However, the molecular mechanism that links BMP9 with liver diseases is still unknown. Here, we report that Bmp9 gene deletion in 129/Ola mice triggers hepatic perisinusoidal fibrosis that was detectable from 15 weeks of age. An inflammatory response appeared within the same time frame as fibrosis, whereas sinusoidal vessel dilation developed later on. Proteomic and mRNA analyses of primary liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) both revealed that the expression of the LSEC-specifying transcription factor GATA-binding protein 4 was strongly reduced in Bmp9 gene knockout (Bmp9-KO) mice as compared with wild-type mice. LSECs from Bmp9-KO mice also lost the expression of several terminal differentiation markers (Lyve1, Stab1, Stab2, Ehd3, Cd209b, eNos, Maf, Plvap). They gained CD34 expression and deposited a basal lamina, indicating that they were capillarized. Another main characteristic of differentiated LSECs is the presence of permeable fenestrae. LSECs from Bmp9-KO mice had a significantly reduced number of fenestrae. This was already observable in 2-week-old pups. Moreover, we could show that addition of BMP9 to primary cultures of LSECs prevented the loss of their fenestrae and maintained the expression levels of Gata4 and Plvap. Conclusion: Taken together, our observations show that BMP9 is a key paracrine regulator of liver homeostasis, controlling LSEC fenestration and protecting against perivascular hepatic fibrosis.

### Hepatic pseudocapillarisation and atherosclerosis in ageing [^15530f8c]. Lancet (2002). Excellent credibility.

Cardiovascular disease secondary to atherosclerosis is the main cause of death and disability in industrialised countries, and ageing is the foremost risk factor for atherosclerosis. We present a hypothesis linking age-specific structural change in the liver with accepted pathogenic mechanisms leading to atherosclerosis. Ageing in the liver is associated with pseudocapillarisation of the sinusoidal endothelium, which is characterised by thickening of endothelium, basement membrane formation, and defenestration (loss of pores). Fenestrations (pores) normally form a liver sieve that allows passage of chylomicron remnants for subsequent uptake and metabolism by hepatocytes. Ageing is associated with impaired clearance of chylomicron remnants, postprandial hypertriglyceridaemia, and hence, atherosclerosis, which we propose is linked directly to loss of permeability of the liver sieve because of defenestration associated with pseudocapillarisation. Development of methods to maintain fenestrations of sinusoidal endothelium or to facilitate refenestration might be a new therapeutic strategy for management of cardiovascular disease in old people.

### Altered AKAP12 expression in portal fibroblasts and liver sinusoids mediates transition from hepatic fibrogenesis to fibrosis resolution [^3b0fdc13]. Experimental & Molecular Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Results

Expression patterns of AKAP12 in normal and fibrotic mouse livers

Immunofluorescence staining of normal mouse liver tissues showed that AKAP12 was expressed along the endothelium and in cells surrounding the portal tract but not in the central vein (Fig. 1a). Double immunofluorescence staining identified AKAP12-expressing cells in the portal tract as PFs as the AKAP12 signal merged with the PF markers thy-1 (Fig. 1b, upper row), desmin, and PDGFRα but not with EpCAM or CD31 (Supplementary Figure 1a). Interestingly, AKAP12-positive cells in the liver parenchyma were LSECs, as revealed by colocalization of AKAP12 with SE-1 signals (Fig. 1b, bottom row) and sinusoidal basement membrane marker collagen type IV (Supplementary Figure 1b). Desmin-positive HSCs were in close proximity to AKAP12-positive cells, but they rarely overlapped (Supplementary Figure 1b). The livers of AKAP12 KO mice exhibited disorganized sieve plates with a ~25% reduction in the number of fenestrae per unit area (Supplementary Figure 2a). However, under normal circumstances, we found no indication of liver disease or histological/functional changes due to the AKAP12 gene (data not shown). To investigate the role of AKAP12 in hepatic fibrosis, we used a biliary fibrosis model induced by DDC-feeding. Aberrant ECM accumulation was induced after 3 weeks of DDC-feeding, by which time AKAP12 expression drastically decreased in both PFs and LSECs (Supplementary Figure 2b and c). We then investigated the course of fibrogenesis and fibrosis resolution by feeding mice a DDC diet for 3 weeks, followed by feeding them a normal diet for 2 weeks (Fig. 1c). ECM accumulation, which was observed from the first week of DDC-feeding, gradually increased until the third week. Fibrosis resolution began as soon as the mice began feeding on a normal diet; regression in ECM deposition was clearly evident by the second week of fibrosis resolution (Fig. 1d). AKAP12 expression in the portal tract and sinusoids decreased sharply from the first week of DDC-feeding but was restored during fibrosis resolution (with the removal of DDC-induced injury), even reaching up to 80% of its normal level after 2 weeks of fibrosis resolution (Fig. 1e, f). These data indicate that AKAP12 expression in PFs and LSECs in the liver is dynamically altered during fibrogenesis and fibrosis resolution.

### Hyperlipidemia and surfactants: the liver sieve is a link [^e3a2ee41]. Atherosclerosis (2006). Low credibility.

Poloxamer 407 is a ubiquitous synthetic surfactant that causes massive hyperlipidemia and atherosclerosis in the rodent. The initial step in hepatic metabolism of lipoproteins is their transfer through 100–200 nm pores (fenestrations) in the liver sinusoidal endothelial cell, prior to receptor-mediated uptake. The 'liver sieve hypothesis' emphasizes the role of these fenestrations in the regulation of lipoprotein disposition. Here we show that P407 causes dramatic defenestration of the liver sinusoidal endothelium in vivo. By 24h after intraperitoneal administration in mice, fenestrations were reduced by approximately 80% coincident with a 10-fold increase in plasma lipids. Moreover impulse-response experiments in the perfused rat liver showed that P407 prevented the passage of small chylomicrons across the liver sinusoidal endothelium. Defenestration was also induced acutely with P407 in isolated liver sinusoidal endothelial cells, indicating this is a direct effect of P407 on fenestrations. The results establish the role of the porosity of the liver sinusoidal endothelial cell as a pivotal yet relatively unrecognised mechanism for hyperlipidemia. Furthermore, the results establish an intriguing mechanism for surfactant-induced hyperlipidemia. Thus the liver sieve is a new and untapped target for the treatment and prevention of hyperlipidemia.

### The size of sinusoidal fenestrae is a critical determinant of hepatocyte transduction after adenoviral gene transfer [^b30d6fdb]. Gene Therapy (2004). Low credibility.

The hepatotropism and intrahepatic distribution of adenoviral vectors may be species dependent. Hepatocyte transduction was evaluated in three rabbit strains after transfer with E1E3E4-deleted adenoviral vectors containing a hepatocyte specific alpha1-antitrypsin promoter-driven expression cassette (AdAT4). Intravenous administration of 4 x 10(12) particles/kg of AdAT4 induced human apo A-I levels above 40 mg/dl in Dutch Belt, but below 1 mg/dl in New Zealand White and Fauve de Bourgogne rabbits. Diameters of sinusoidal fenestrae were significantly (P = 0.0014) larger in Dutch Belt (124 ± 3.4 nm) than in New Zealand White (108 ± 1.3 nm) and Fauve de Bourgogne (105 ± 2.6 nm) rabbits, suggesting that a smaller size constitutes a barrier for hepatocyte transduction. Indeed, intraportal transfer preceded by intraportal injection of sodium decanoate, which increases the diameter of sinusoidal fenestrae to 123 ± 3.4 nm (P < 0.01) in New Zealand White rabbits, increased human apo A-I levels 32- and 120-fold in New Zealand White and Fauve de Bourgogne rabbits, respectively, but did not affect expression in Dutch Belt rabbits. In conclusion, size of sinusoidal fenestrae appears to be a critical determinant of hepatocyte transduction after adenoviral transfer.

As capillarization of the sinusoids results in a distorted structure of hepatic sinusoids and loss of specific endothelial fenestration, we examined the level of fenestration in the mouse livers of CCl 4 ‐induced liver fibrosis models using scanning electron microscopy. Liver sinusoid endothelial cells (LSECs) from CCl 4 ‐treated mice lost their fenestration, indicating increased sinusoid capillarization (Figure 1D, E). Decreased expression of LYVE1 and increased expression of CD34 have also been used as the characteristics of capillarization. Our data showed that LYVE1 staining was significantly decreased in the mouse livers of CCl 4 ‐induced liver fibrosis models (Figure 1F, G), and the mRNA expression of CD34 was significantly increased in the mouse livers of CCl 4 ‐induced liver fibrosis models (Figure 1H).

### Endothelial RUNX3 controls LSEC dysfunction and angiocrine LRG1 signaling to prevent liver fibrosis [^0381d5c6]. Hepatology (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

More than two million people die from chronic liver disease annually, representing 4% of all deaths globally. Liver fibrosis, an abnormal repair mechanism in response to injury, represents the final pathway of almost all chronic liver diseases regardless of etiology. Liver fibrosis is reversible in the early stages; however, given the scarcity of effective treatments, it gradually develops into cirrhosis and HCC, which are the 2 major attributes of liver disease–related mortality. Unfortunately, effective diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for liver fibrosis remain elusive due to the complex and poorly understood molecular mechanisms underlying the disease. Therefore, understanding the underlying molecular mechanisms of liver fibrogenesis is vital for the development of such effective therapeutic strategies.

Various factors, such as genetic anomalies, alcohol, drugs, cholestasis, metabolic dysfunction, and viral infections, can trigger liver fibrosis and disrupt hepatic architecture and function, secondary to excessive accumulation of the extracellular matrix. After liver injury, activated HSCs transdifferentiate into fibrogenic myofibroblasts, which are key drivers of liver fibrogenesis.HSC activation highly depends on the interaction between different cell types, including hepatocytes, KCs, liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs), and infiltrating immune cells involving several soluble and secreted mediators.

In organ-specific microvascular heterogeneity, LSECs are prime examples of structural and functional angiodiversity. Unlike other endothelial cells (ECs), LSECs possess a unique morphology because they exhibit an open fenestration and no basement membrane. In response to injury, LSECs undergo defenestration and formation of the basement membrane, known as capillarization, which triggers HSC activation; thus, LSECs may be the gatekeeping cells of fibrosis progression. LSEC-derived angiocrine factors are involved in liver homeostasis and disease pathogenesis through intercellular crosstalk regulation, which is essential for deciphering the pathogenic mechanisms and therapeutic targets of liver fibrosis. – However, studies on the mechanisms by which LSECs maintain their gatekeeping and angiocrine functions are limited; hence, further examination is needed.

### Albumin in decompensated cirrhosis: new concepts and perspectives [^3e021a2e]. Gut (2020). Medium credibility.

Figure 4
Albumin recycling by endothelial cells. Endothelial cell recycling is the mechanism maintaining high concentrations of healthy albumin within the systemic circulation. Albumin is synthesised by the liver and rapidly released to the intravascular compartment. The total amount of albumin in humans is approximately 360 g, 120 g being in the intravascular and 240 g in the extravascular compartment. intravascular albumin is constantly being exchanged (4%–5%/hour through the endothelium with the extravascular pool. In organs having sinusoids or capillaries with fenestrated endothelium, albumin can pass through the large capillary gaps. In the remaining capillaries with continuous endothelium, albumin is transported by an active transcytotic mechanism mediated by the gp60 receptor albondin (not shown). There is a second group of receptors (gp18 and gp30) expressed in many tissues that governs degradation of albumin. These surface cell receptors (not drawn in the figure) show 1000-fold higher affinity for chemically modified albumin (ie, oxidised albumin). Once internalised, this modified albumin is degraded in the lysosomes. Finally, a third type of albumin receptor (FcRn) that rescues albumin from lysosomal degradation contributes to extend the albumin half-life. The low endosomal pH promotes the link of healthy albumin and FcRn in the acidified endosome. When the recycling endosome contacts the higher plasma pH, healthy albumin is released to the systemic circulation.

Liver fibrosis and cirrhosis

Liver fibrosis is a wound-healing response to liver inflammation and injury, which can further progress to cirrhosis and HCC with currently no approved treatment options. Although the uptake of drugs into the liver is usually high, this is not the case in a fibrotic liver. Drug targeting to fibrogenic cells in a fibrotic liver is relatively low and often associated with off-target effects due to compromised hepatic metabolism and excretion, and therefore, researchers are currently in dire need of a breakthrough to safely treat liver fibrosis, which could also reduce its progression to cirrhosis and HCC.

A key event during liver fibrosis is the activation of quiescent HSCs, and therefore, strategies to specifically target these cells are necessary. Furthermore, activated HSCs differentiate into myofibroblasts and lead to excessive extracellular matrix (ECM) secretion and accumulation at all stages of fibrosis and cirrhosis. The accumulation of ECM further causes sinusoidal remodeling by reducing the fenestrations on sinusoidal endothelial cells, and this in return hinders the normal bidirectional metabolic exchange between the hepatic portal vein and hepatocytes along with reduced passive transport of therapeutic drugs as depicted in Figure 4. – Moreover, this also limits and compromises the RNA-based drug delivery to HSCs for the treatment of liver fibrosis. For RNA therapies to exert their therapeutic effect, NPs need to be taken up by the HSCs and should be capable of cytosolic RNA release. However, in liver fibrosis, the accumulation of ECM hinders and limits the overall NP transport; hence, there is reduced or low NP uptake by the HSCs. Also, considering the stability of the RNA nanoformulations, ECM hindrance can delay the overall cellular transport and lead to the degradation of the RNA nanotherapies. It is therefore of utmost importance to consider these limitations, and therefore, researchers are attempting to target ECM reduction as a potential treatment strategy irrespective of the stimuli causing the disease. – In return, a successful ECM reduction therapy would not only decrease these hindering ECM fenestrations but also increase cellular uptake of RNA-based therapies for a more stable and efficient therapeutic response in liver fibrosis.

### Angiocrine signaling in sinusoidal homeostasis and liver diseases [^e5ae2b99]. Journal of Hepatology (2024). Medium credibility.

The hepatic sinusoids are composed of liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs), which are surrounded by hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) and contain liver-resident macrophages called Kupffer cells, and other patrolling immune cells. All these cells communicate with each other and with hepatocytes to maintain sinusoidal homeostasis and a spectrum of hepatic functions under healthy conditions. Sinusoidal homeostasis is disrupted by metabolites, toxins, viruses, and other pathological factors, leading to liver injury, chronic liver diseases, and cirrhosis. Alterations in hepatic sinusoids are linked to fibrosis progression and portal hypertension. LSECs are crucial regulators of cellular crosstalk within their microenvironment via angiocrine signaling. This review discusses the mechanisms by which angiocrine signaling orchestrates sinusoidal homeostasis, as well as the development of liver diseases. Here, we summarise the crosstalk between LSECs, HSCs, hepatocytes, cholangiocytes, and immune cells in health and disease and comment on potential novel therapeutic methods for treating liver diseases.

### Age-related pseudocapillarization of the human liver [^d08fcf9f]. The Journal of Pathology (2003). Low credibility.

Age-related changes in liver function are important because they may promote susceptibility to adverse drug reactions, neurotoxicity, atherosclerosis, and other important diseases in older people. Age-related changes in the rat hepatic sinusoidal endothelium, termed pseudocapillarization, have been described recently and these may contribute to hepatic impairment. The present study has examined surgical and post-mortem specimens with immunohistochemistry and transmission electron microscopy to determine whether pseudocapillarization also occurs in older humans. The age of the subject, independent of systemic disease or hepatic pathology in surgical and post-mortem samples of human liver, was associated with increased peri-sinusoidal expression of von Willebrand's factor, collagen I, collagen IV, and staining with Masson's trichrome. Electron microscopy revealed significant age-related thickening of the sinusoidal endothelium (young 165 ± 17 nm, middle age 222 ± 11 nm, older 289 ± 9 nm, p < 0.001) with loss of fenestrations (young 7.7 ± 0.7 per 10 micro m, middle age 3.6 ± 0.5 per 10 micro m, older 1.5 ± 0.4 per 10 micro m, p < 0.001), and age-related deposition of basal lamina and collagen. In conclusion, ageing in humans is associated with morphological changes in the sinusoidal endothelium and space of Disse which are presumptively related to the ageing process and potentially represent an important link between the ageing process and disease susceptibility.

### Quantitative modeling of the physiology of ascites in portal hypertension [^deabee00]. BMC Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

B. Fluid transport across the intestinal mesothelium

The mesothelial membrane (Figure 1) separates the intestinal tissue space from the peritoneal space. It is assumed that the "intestinal" mesothelial and capillary membrane have similar protein permeability properties, with the rate of fluid exchange between the tissue and peritoneal space (J I) described by:

where P A and Π A are the hydrostatic and colloid osmotic pressures in the peritoneal (ascitic) space and L I is the mesothelial hydraulic permeability. It is also assumed that the mesothelial membrane cannot support appreciable mechanical forces so that, to a first approximation, there is no hydrostatic pressure gradient across this membrane:

and eq. (4) reduces to:

As discussed in detail in the Additional file 1 Section IB, the mesothelial barrier is ignored in the peritoneal dialysis literatures where it is assumed that this membrane is highly permeable to both protein and fluid. This assumption would not significantly change any of our model results or conclusions and, as is shown Section III, the quantitative steady state relations are identical, with or without, a mesothelial barrier. We feel experimental evidence supporting a significant mesothelial barrier is sufficient to keep this barrier in the model.

C. Fluid transport across the liver

The fenestrated liver sinusoids allow relatively free passage of proteins between the blood and tissue. Thus, to a first approximation, the sinusoidal and tissue hydrostatic and colloid osmotic pressures are approximately equal:

The normal liver sinusoidal pressure (P S) and, therefore, the liver tissue pressure (P L) is about 5 mm Hg (see Section IIC), significantly greater than the normal pressure in the peritoneal space (P A ≈ 2 mmHg). It follows that the liver capsule, in contrast to the intestinal mesothelium, is able to maintain a hydrostatic pressure difference between the tissue and peritoneal space. Assuming that the capsule is relatively impermeable to albumin, the pressure difference between the liver tissue and peritoneal space (P L -P A) would have to overcome the tissue colloid osmotic pressure (≈ 25 mmHg) before there would be net fluid movement across the liver surface. As is discussed below, fluid leaks from the liver into the peritoneal space at pressures well below 25 mm Hg indicating that the source of this fluid is rupture of either the capsule or surface lymphatics.

### Microenvironmental regulation of the sinusoidal endothelial cell phenotype in vitro [^0b511e5f]. Hepatology (2009). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) differ, both structurally and functionally, from endothelial cells (ECs) lining blood vessels of other tissues. For example, in contrast to other ECs, LSECs possess fenestrations, have low detectable levels of platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1 expression, and in rat tissue, they distinctively express a cell surface marker recognized by the SE-1 antibody. These unique phenotypic characteristics seen in hepatic tissue are lost over time upon culture in vitro; therefore, this study sought to systematically examine the effects of microenvironmental stimuli — namely, extracellular matrix and neighboring cells, on the LSEC phenotype in vitro. In probing the role of the underlying extracellular matrix, we identified collagen I and collagen III as well as mixtures of collagen I/collagen IV/fibronectin as having a positive effect on LSEC survival. Furthermore, using a stable hepatocellular model (hepatocyte-fibroblast) we were able to prolong the expression of both SE-1 and phenotypic functions of LSEC such as factor VIII activity and AcLOL uptake in cocultured LSECs through the production of short-range paracrine signals. In the course of these experiments, we identified the antigen recognized by SE-1 as CD32b.

Conclusion

Collectively, this study has identified several microenvironmental regulators of liver sinusoidal endothelial cells that prolong their phenotypic functions for up to 2 weeks in culture, enabling the development of better in vitro models of liver physiology and disease.

### Guidance for industry drug-induced liver injury… [^3426bbe0]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

### Hydroporation as the mechanism of hydrodynamic delivery [^d6fa89e5]. Gene Therapy (2004). Low credibility.

We have reported that a rapid tail vein injection of a large volume of plasmid DNA solution into a mouse results in high level of transgene expression in the liver. Gene transfer efficiency of this hydrodynamics-based procedure is determined by the combined effect of a large volume and high injection speed. Here, we show that the hydrodynamic injection induces a transient irregularity of heart function, a sharp increase in venous pressure, an enlargement of liver fenestrae, and enhancement of membrane permeability of the hepatocytes. At the cellular level, our results suggest that hepatic delivery by the hydrodynamic injection is accomplished by the generation of membrane pores in the hepatocytes.

### Semaphorin-3A regulates liver sinusoidal endothelial cell porosity and promotes hepatic steatosis [^d480f3f8]. Nature Cardiovascular Research (2024). High credibility.

Source data

We next treated LSECs with 1 µg mL −1 SEMA3A-Fc (or 1 µg mL −1 control IgG2a-Fc) for 30, 60 or 90 min and observed a time-dependent SEMA3A-Fc-mediated reduction of fenestrae frequency and LSEC porosity (Fig. 3g–i). Neither fenestrae frequency and diameter nor porosity changed after 30 min of SEMA3A-Fc treatment. In contrast, while fenestrae frequency and LSEC porosity increased after culturing LSECs for 60 min under IgG2a-Fc control culture conditions (a likely result of the recovery of LSECs from the MACS isolation process), a significant reduction of fenestrae frequency and porosity was visible after 60 and 90 min of SEMA3A-Fc treatment (Fig. 3g, i). In contrast to the fenestrae frequency, the fenestrae diameter remained unchanged during treatment with SEMA3A-Fc at all time points (Fig. 3h). Our experiments therefore suggest that SEMA3A reduces LSEC porosity by decreasing the frequency (rather than the diameter) of fenestrae.

### Cell-to-cell and organ-to-organ crosstalk in the pathogenesis of alcohol-associated liver disease [^d69da39e]. Egastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

The loss of fenestrae and the capillarisation of LSECs are also associated with disrupted crosstalk between LSECs and other liver cells, including hepatocytes, HSCs and macrophages, further contributing to the development of liver fibrosis. Moreover, elevated plasma markers such as vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, E-selectin and von Willebrand factor are observed in patients with severe AH and are associated with disease severity and prognosis. These endothelial dysfunction markers suggest that LSECs play a critical role in the pathogenesis of ALD and may serve as predictors of patient outcomes in AH.

Furthermore, LSECs have been shown to recruit bone marrow progenitor cells in response to liver injury, such as partial hepatectomy or toxin exposure, facilitating liver regeneration. However, their role in the regenerative response in ALD remains unclear and is an area of ongoing research. Understanding how LSECs contribute to liver repair mechanisms in ALD could unlock new therapeutic strategies to enhance liver regeneration in these patients.

In summary, LSECs are integral to various aspects of ALD pathogenesis, including ethanol metabolism, oxidative stress regulation, inflammation, fibrosis and potentially regeneration. Given their central role in liver function and disease progression, targeting LSECs and their associated molecular pathways represents a promising therapeutic approach for treating ALD and improving patient outcomes.

Macrophages

The liver contains two distinct populations of macrophages: resident KCs and infiltrating macrophages derived from circulating monocytes. KCs are specialised macrophages that maintain liver homeostasis by clearing pathogens and cellular debris under normal conditions. However, during liver injury, such as chronic ethanol exposure, the liver's inflammatory environment triggers the recruitment of circulating monocytes. These monocytes differentiate into infiltrating macrophages, which play a crucial role in tissue homeostasis, particularly in response to the heightened demands of pathogen clearance, tissue repair and immune modulation.

In mouse models, infiltrating macrophages arise from two major subsets of circulating monocytes: classical Ly-6C hi and non-classical Ly-6C low cells. These are analogous to the human monocyte subsets CD14 hi CD16 − and CD14 dim CD16 + monocytes, respectively. Ly-6C low macrophages are characterised by their anti-inflammatory and tissue-protective properties. They promote tissue repair and help resolve inflammation, thus contributing to liver recovery following injury. In contrast, Ly-6C hi macrophages adopt a pro-inflammatory phenotype, releasing cytokines that exacerbate liver damage and inflammation. Interestingly, Ly-6C hi macrophages can transition to a Ly-6C low phenotype after phagocytosing apoptotic hepatocytes, indicating a possible regulatory mechanism that aids in resolving inflammation and promoting tissue repair.

### Three-dimensional ultrastructure of capillary endothelial glycocalyx under normal and experimental endotoxemic conditions [^dfc2dff9]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The sugar-protein glycocalyx coats all healthy vascular endothelium and plays a key role in microvascular and endothelial physiology through its influence on the regulation of microvascular tone and endothelial permeability, maintenance of an oncotic gradient across the endothelial barrier, regulation of adhesion/migration of leukocytes, and inhibition of intravascular thrombosis. Components of glycocalyx include cell-bound proteoglycans, glycosaminoglycan side chains, and sialoproteins. Proteoglycans consist of a core protein, such as a syndecan family protein, to which glycosaminoglycan is linked. Because glycosaminoglycan side chains contain a high density of negative charges, electrostatic repulsion drives albumin away from the vessel wall, toward the center of the lumen.

Endothelial cell structures are specific for each organ and include at least three types of capillaries: continuous, fenestrated, and sinusoidal. Continuous capillaries are characterized by the presence of an uninterrupted endothelium with a continuous basal lamina. This type is found in muscle tissues, heart, lung, brain, and other organs. Fenestrated capillaries are found in the renal glomeruli and endocrine glands, among other tissues. They are characterized by the presence of circular fenestrae or pores that penetrate the endothelium. Sinusoids are found in the liver and hematopoietic organs such as the bone marrow and the spleen. Sinusoidal capillaries are a special type of open-pore capillary also known as discontinuous capillaries, which have larger openings with diameters of 30–40 μm in the endothelium. Given the structural and functional differences among the endothelium types, one could speculate that the morphology of glycocalyx would also vary among the different types of endothelial cells.

The endothelial glycocalyx has matrix properties and restricts larger macromolecules to the vessel lumen, which called into question the conventional theory that simple filtration is regulated through variable gaps between the cells, as stated in the Starling Principle of transvascular fluid dynamics. However, the revised Starling Principle suggests Starling forces are only applied across the endothelial glycocalyx as a molecular sieve for plasma proteins. In fact, the hydraulic permeability rises dramatically when the endothelial glycocalyx is experimentally removed. The endothelial glycocalyx is reportedly damaged under stress conditions such as sepsis. Diffuse and persistent alterations in the glycocalyx are linked to widespread endothelial dysfunction, altered permeability, and impaired oxygen and nutrient delivery to cells. However, there have been few reports directly examining the morphology of the glycocalyx in each capillary type. In the present study, therefore, we investigated the three-dimensional ultrastructure of vascular endothelial glycocalyx in the heart, kidney, and liver under normal and pathological conditions.

### Deconvoluting hepatic processing of carbon nanotubes [^7fdfff30]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

The vascular endothelial architecture serves as the primary conduit to distribute fCNT in vivo but there was no evidence that these cells accumulated this nanomaterial (Fig. 2e). This particular result calls attention to the differential functionality and receptor expression of these two endothelial cell types with continuous or discontinuous fenestrated cytoplasm. Cultured endothelial cells were observed to accumulate SWCNT, albeit under non-physiologic conditions over a prolonged time, however, our PET imaging and IF studies have not identified any fCNT accumulation in the VE.

Intact fCNT cleared the liver via secreted bile (Fig. 1f and Supplementary Figs 2 and 3). The presence of intact radiolabeled fCNT in the bile, intestines and faeces strongly supported a mechanism of hepatobiliary clearance. The epithelial bile duct cells that comprise these channels did not show any fCNT accretion (Supplementary Fig. 8). We propose that a portion of the fCNT in the sinusoid, not endocytosed by LSEC, diffused from the Disse space into the biliary canaliculi and subsequently mixed with bile. Because we observed no evidence of fCNT in hepatocytes and the bile contained intact nanomaterial, it is difficult to reconcile a mechanism whereby hepatocytes mediated transport of fCNT from blood to bile. Evidence does exist for a permeable barrier permitting pigments and cellular debris to bypass hepatocyte processing and transit directly from blood to bile; scanning electron microscopy has shown 100 nm zones between the space of Disse and the bile canaliculi that were interpreted as sites for molecular diffusion. These permeable Disse/canalicular junctions have been utilized to effect retrograde, non-viral gene therapy to the liver via infusion from the biliary tree. Conventional views of hepatocyte-mediated elimination of blood-borne solutes into bile have overlooked this interesting diffusion process across the Disse/canalicular junction.

### Quantitative modeling of the physiology of ascites in portal hypertension [^11a8537b]. BMC Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

The protein concentration in ascitic peritoneal fluid in portal hypertension is low, roughly equal to the protein concentration of intestinal lymph. There is a definite "capillarization" of liver sinusoids in cirrhosis and some authors have suggested that the ascites protein is roughly equal to the low liver tissue protein produced by this capillarization. However, even in severe cirrhosis sinusoidal fenestra are still present and the liver lymph protein/plasma ratio (which is a measure of tissue protein) is about 0.6, much greater than the corresponding ascites protein ratio of 0.17. Furthermore, this liver lymph protein/plasma ratio of 0.6 may underestimate the liver tissue protein because of lymphatic contributions from peribiliary capillaries and admixture from intestinal lymph. An alternative explanation for this low ascites protein, which is directly supported by our quantitative model (Section III), is that the high protein fluid leaking from the liver pulls fluid osmotically from the "intestinal" tissue space (eq. (4)), diluting the peritoneal fluid protein until it roughly equals the intestinal tissue protein concentration. This implies that the rate of formation of ascitic fluid is determined primarily by two factors: the rate of protein leak from the liver and the interstitial protein concentration of the intestine, a concept alluded to in the older literature but seldom discussed in recent reviews of ascites. This mechanism provides a straight forward explanation for use of the serum-ascites albumin gradient (SAAG) in the differential diagnosis of ascites (see Section IIE).

Since the ascites protein concentration in portal hypertension is only about 1/3 of that of the fluid leaking from the liver, the bulk of ascitic fluid is derived from the intestine rather than the liver. This fluid movement from the intestine into the peritoneum continues as long as the liver continues to leak protein. Homeostasis is achieved when the rising ascitic pressure (P A) increases the rate of peritoneal lymph and protein drainage until it equals the rate at which protein leaks from the liver. Although it has been hypothesized that increased ascites pressure (P A) should slow the rate of liver leak, as is discussed below, this should be a small to negligible effect because an increase in P A should produce a proportional increase in P L. The crucial parameter characterizing the rate of leakage of fluid from the liver is the value of (P L - P A). Experimental measurements of this parameter are discussed in the next section.

### Deconvoluting hepatic processing of carbon nanotubes [^665684bc]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

The spleen and lymph nodes also accumulated fCNT and clearance was connected to the expression of both Stabilin receptors in these tissues. The implications are exciting because one can now predict fCNT accumulation based on receptor recognition. Lymph node clearance of fCNT has not been reported until now and only discovered on the basis of lymph expression of Stabilin receptors. Based on our identification of Stabilin-mediated endocytosis of fCNT, we looked for and confirmed accumulation in lymph nodes. The specific accumulation of fCNT by these organs was observed in biodistribution studies (Fig. 1f and Supplementary Fig. 2) and blocked in heparin competition studies (Fig. 3a). In parallel with the liver, the specialized splenic sinusoidal endothelium (SSEC) also internalized fCNT while splenic macrophage clearance was not observed (Supplementary Fig. 17). The splenic sinusoids are tortuous VE termini lined with SSEC. The SSEC differ from LSEC in that they exhibit continuous cytoplasm and disorganized basement membrane. The spleen is another important reticuloendothelial tissue and it paralleled the liver in the cell types that localized fCNT. Lymphatic endothelial cell accumulation of fCNT now warrants further investigation.

These data contribute significantly to our understanding of the hepatic processing of fCNT in vivo. The pharmacokinetic and safety profile of fCNT in a non-human primate strongly proposes extrapolation to humans. The predominant hepatic cell type that accumulated this fibrillar nanocarbon was a professional scavenger endothelial cell in the sinusoid that performed rapidly and at high capacity. Mouse LSEC has 14 ± 5 fenestrae per μm 2 (humans have 15–25 per μm 2) with diameters of 99 ± 18 nm (humans, 50 < d < 300 nm). This is an avid, dedicated mammalian scavenger cell and in combination with intact biliary elimination of fCNT has yielded a very favourable biological outcome for soluble fibrillar nanocarbon in animal models. Biocompatibility has been confirmed in several model systems and now these results explain the action of the host on fCNT and add further weight to arguments for use in man.

### Hydrogen flush after cold storage as a new end-ischemic Ex vivo treatment for liver grafts against ischemia / reperfusion injury [^c0fc1d4c]. Liver Transplantation (2018). Low credibility.

Regarding the functional integrity of the sinusoidal endothelia, hyaluronic acid clearance was more than 7 times higher in HyFACS‐PV (880.4 ± 138.6 ng/g liver/hour) and ‐PV + HA (928.4 ± 370.5) than in the control group (119.1 ± 63.4; P < 0.01; Fig. 4 B). Of interest, HyFACS‐HA (188.0 ± 117.0) could not efficiently protect SEC function, indicating HyFACS via PV route maintained the viability of SECs more effectively rather than via HA.

Consistently, SEM observation revealed apparent damage of fused and enlarged fenestrae on SECs in control livers, whereas sinusoidal linings and fenestrae therein were well maintained in all of the HyFACS groups, particularly in HyFACS‐PV and ‐PV + HA (Fig. 4 C‐F).

### A strategy of vascular-targeted therapy for liver fibrosis [^5c2be916]. Hepatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Scanning electron microscopy analysis, LYVE1 staining, and CD34 mRNA measurement showed that compared with that in the control group, decreased sinusoid capillarization was observed in AAV9‐LECT2‐shRNA‐infected mice. Bevacizumab treatment significantly decreased sinusoid capillarization and rVEGF treatment significantly increased sinusoid capillarization, respectively. Compared with the bevacizumab treatment alone, the combinational treatment of AAV9‐LECT2‐shRNA and bevacizumab further decreased sinusoid capillarization. Compared with the rVEGF treatment alone, the combinational treatment of AAV9‐LECT2‐shRNA and rVEGF also further decreased sinusoid capillarization (Figure 6A‐E; Figure S4). These results and the results in Figure 4 suggest that the decrease of sinusoid capillarization alleviated liver fibrosis.

### Nucleic acid spheres for treating capillarisation of liver sinusoidal endothelial cells in liver fibrosis [^193a1d57]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) lose their characteristic fenestrations and become capillarized during the progression of liver fibrosis. Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) transplantation can reverse this capillarization and reduce fibrosis, but MSC therapy has practical limitations that hinder its clinical use. Here, with the help of artificial intelligence (AI), we show that MSCs secrete a microRNA (miR-325-3p) that helps restore LSEC fenestrations (tiny pores) by modulating their cytoskeleton, effectively reversing capillarization. We further develop a spherical nucleic acid (SNA) nanoparticle carrying miR-325-3p as an alternative to MSC therapy. This SNA specifically enters fibrotic LSECs via the scavenger receptor A (Scara). In three mouse models of liver fibrosis, the SNA treatment restores LSEC fenestrations, reverses capillarization, and significantly reduces fibrosis without adverse effects. Our findings highlight the potential of SNA-based therapy for liver fibrosis, paving the way for targeted nucleic acid treatments directed at LSECs and offering hope for patients.

Off-drug induces enlargement of pore sizes of liver vessels

Under physiological condition, liver microvasculatures consist of sinusoidal discontinuous capillaries that possess incomplete basal membrane and fenestrated endothelial lining, manifesting sinusoidal open pores on the vessel wall. The average size of sinusoidal open pores in mouse liver was ∼75 nm in diameter and anti-VEGF treatment did not significantly alter fenestration pore sizes (Fig. 2a, c). Cessation of anti-VEGF blockade and sunitinib resulted in marked structural changes of liver sinusoidal capillaries with marked enlargement of pore sizes. Sinusoidal pore sizes of 15–20-fold increase were often observed after discontinuation of anti-VEGF treatments (Fig. 2a–d). For the VEGF blockade-treated liver, pore enlargement occurred at day 6 off-drug and persisted at least until day 28 after treatment (Fig. 2a, c and Supplementary Fig. 4a). At day 42 off-drug, sinusoidal pore sizes returned to those before treatment (Supplementary Fig. 4). Compared with VEGF blockade, sunitinib-treated liver showed early expansion of sinusoidal pore sizes already at day 2 off-drug (Fig. 2b, d). However, enlarged pores reversed to normal sizes already at day 21 off-drug (Supplementary Fig. 4b). Diameters of some sinusoidal pores reached 1,000 nm (Supplementary Fig. 4c). The off-sunitinib triggered early occurrence and termination of pore enlargement again reflected a short half-life relative to the VEGF blockade. Of note, vascular cast imaging analysis showed distinctive features of liver sinusoidal capillaries after discontinuation of treatment. Both off-VEGF blockade and off-sunitinib triggered bulb-like structures, reflecting highly leakiness of liver sinusoidal capillaries (Fig. 2a, b, e, f).

### The importance of endothelial protection: the emerging role of defibrotide in reversing endothelial injury and its sequelae [^3e72d43a]. Bone Marrow Transplantation (2021). Medium credibility.

VOD/SOS, a potentially life-threatening HCT complication, is caused by prolonged sinusoidal endothelial cell activation and subsequent injury from radiation or toxic metabolites of chemotherapy within HCT conditioning regimens. Endothelial cell damage increases expression of von Willebrand factor (vWF), which stimulates platelet aggregation, and tissue factor, which promotes activation of coagulation factors. Endothelial cell damage also increases expression of inflammatory mediators, such as intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and releases heparanase, which results in loss of cytoskeletal structure. In the liver, as the sinusoidal endothelium deteriorates, gaps form in the endothelial lining, allowing cellular debris to enter the space of Disse, leading to sinusoidal narrowing. This is accompanied by downstream embolism of sinusoidal endothelial cells which cause a progressive blockage of sinusoidal flow. Changes induced by endothelial cell activation induce a shift in phenotype, from antithrombotic to procoagulant, with hypofibrinolysis reflected by downregulation of tissue plasminogen activator and markedly increased plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) levels, leukocyte adhesion molecule expression, cytokine production, and loss of vascular integrity. These changes appear to be a common pathogenic mechanism underlying a range of conditions. Notably, endothelial cells are not all the same, performing different functions depending on their location in the body. The endothelium arises from cell differentiation in the mesoderm; however, other cell lineages may also transdifferentiate into endothelial cells. Therefore, features such as Weibel–Palade bodies or fenestrae are not found in every endothelial cell. Consequently, endothelial cell heterogeneity has posed a challenge for developing treatments.

This article discusses and reviews the proposed mechanism of action of defibrotide, an endothelial cell protector.

### Semaphorin-3A regulates liver sinusoidal endothelial cell porosity and promotes hepatic steatosis [^e235e4a9]. Nature Cardiovascular Research (2024). High credibility.

NRP1 is essential for SEMA3A-mediated defenestration of LSECs

SEMA3A and VEGF-A can both bind to NRP1, but to different subdomains. To find out whether NRP1 is required for the defenestrating effect of SEMA3A, we pretreated mouse LSECs with three different blocking antibodies against NRP1: (1) an antibody that blocks the VEGF-A binding domain of NRP1 (anti-NRP1 B or anti-NRP1 VEGF); (2) an antibody blocking the SEMA3A-binding domain of NRP1 (anti-NRP1 A or anti-NRP1 SEMA3A); and (3) a commercial antibody blocking the complete extracellular domain of NRP1 (anti-NRP1 pan) (Fig. 4a). We found that SEMA3A-Fc led to a reduction of fenestrae frequency in the presence of anti-NRP1 VEGF antibodies (Fig. 4b, c). In contrast, SEMA3A-Fc-mediated defenestration was reduced in LSECs in the presence of either anti-NRP1 SEMA3A or anti-NRP1 pan (Fig. 4b–e). Again, fenestrae diameter was not affected by SEMA3A signaling (Fig. 4d) and consistent with the observed changes in fenestrae frequency (Fig. 4c), LSEC porosity was also dependent on the binding of SEMA3A-Fc to the SEMA3A-binding domain of NRP1 rather than its VEGF-A binding domain (Fig. 4e). We conclude that SEMA3A selectively induces LSEC defenestration by binding to NRP1.

### Capillarization of hepatic sinusoid by liver endothelial cell-reactive autoantibodies in patients with cirrhosis and chronic hepatitis [^45e07a89]. The American Journal of Pathology (2003). Low credibility.

The special features of liver sinusoidal endothelium (LSE) are crucial for normal liver physiology. Cirrhotic livers, especially in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), are characterized by transformation of the LSE into a continuous, vascular type. The transformation is important for disease progression and explains some of the pathological hallmarks of the cirrhotic liver. Here, we investigated the presence of liver sinusoidal endothelial cell (LSEC)-reactive autoantibodies (Abs) in the sera of patients with autoimmune liver diseases, and assessed the ability of these Abs to transform LSE into vascular endothelium. Compared to healthy individuals (9%), significantly higher numbers of patients with PBC (59%; P < 0.001) and autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) (32%; P < 0.05) had Abs against LSECs. Incubation of primary LSEC cultures with F(ab')(2) fragments of anti-LSEC Abs isolated from sera of patients with PBC and AIH, induced 1) cell surface expression of vascular endothelium-associated markers, CD31, and factor VIII-related antigen; 2) significant production of fibronectin, laminin and collagen type IV; 3) loss of fenestrae, formation of tight junctions and Weibel-Palade bodies. Deposition of immunoglobulins on LSECs were found in liver biopsies of AIH and PBC patients. Thus, anti-LSEC autoAbs transform LSE into a vascular type and may therefore play an important role in the development of hepatocellular failure and portal hypertension in PBC and AIH patients.

### Deconvoluting hepatic processing of carbon nanotubes [^272a26b3]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

This paper reports several novel and unexpected details of hepatic processing of covalently functionalized nanotubes including receptor-mediated endocytosis, cellular trafficking and biliary elimination. First, water-soluble ammonium-functionalized fibrillar nanocarbon is found to preferentially localize in the fenestrated sinusoidal endothelium of the liver but not hepatocytes or resident macrophages. Second, both scavenger Stabilin receptors mediate the endocytic clearance of nanotubes. This particular receptor specificity for nanocarbon leads us to find that lymph tissue also accumulates carbon nanotubes. Third, we propose a mechanism for the hepatobiliary elimination of nanocarbon. Fourth, biocompatibility is evidenced by the absence of cell death and no immune cell infiltration. Towards clinical application of this platform, nanotubes were evaluated for the first time in non-human primates. The pharmacologic profile in cynomolgus monkeys is equivalent to what was reported in mice and suggests that nanotubes should behave similarly in humans.

### Fungal dissemination is limited by liver macrophage filtration of the blood [^01f38a5f]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

The liver is the biggest internal organ receiving blood supply from both the hepatic artery and the portal vein. It is estimated that every minute, 30% of the body's total volume of blood passes through the liver. Kupffer cells (KCs) are liver-resident macrophages and constitute ~90% of total tissue macrophages in the body. They generally reside within the lumen of the liver sinusoids, and adhere to the endothelial lining of blood vessels –. Recent studies showed that the liver is a primary surveillance organ for intravascular infections, and is especially important for filtering bacterial pathogens via KCs to maintain blood sterility –. It remains unknown whether the liver plays an important role in preventing fungal dissemination during invasive fungal infections (including cryptococcosis) which kill about one and a half million people every year worldwide.

We formulated a hypothesis that the liver plays a prominent role in filtering disseminating fungi out of the vasculature. In the current study, with the use of intravital microscopy (IVM), we examined the dynamic interactions between liver KCs and disseminating fungal cells and the underlying mechanisms using mouse models of infection with C. neoformans and Candida albicans. The results show that liver KCs actively capture circulating fungal cells, thus reducing their dissemination to target organs. Moreover, KCs internalize captured fungal cells and inhibit their proliferation in an IFN-γ independent manner.

### Endothelial damage and dysfunction in acute graft-versus-host disease [^f7c3eab7]. Haematologica (2021). Medium credibility.

In order to investigate, if the reduced expression of tight junction and intercellular connection proteins of the endothelium during aGvHD have functional consequences in vivo, we injected Evans blue solution intravenously and analyzed the penetration into the organs. In allo-HSCT recipients with aGvHD endothelial leakage was significantly increased in liver (Figure 3F) and colon (Figure 3L) as compared to HSCT recipients without aGvHD.

Next, we were interested if the detected endothelial changes occurred exclusively in the target organs during aGvHD or if this is a systemic effect. We therefore analyzed endothelial leakage in the kidney and skeletal muscle, which are typically not affected in human aGvHD. We have previously confirmed these organs to be unaffected by aGvHD in our models. The Evans blue assay revealed no significant changes of endothelial leakage in these non-target organs during aGvHD (Online Supplementary Figure 3A and B) suggesting that increased endothelial leakiness predominantly occurs in aGvHD target organs.

### Early endostatin treatment inhibits metastatic seeding of murine colorectal cancer cells in the liver and their adhesion to endothelial cells [^5f440a48]. British Journal of Cancer (2005). Low credibility.

As in a previous study, we found that endostatin is effective against colorectal liver metastases. Solaun et al showed that the antiangiogenic mechanism (i.e. endothelial cell apoptosis) was selective for sinusoidal-type metastases, in which the neovasculature originating from sinusoidal endothelium cells was targeted by endostatin. Differences in the tumour's microenvironment are known to determine antitumour efficacy of the treatment The precursor of endostatin, the long form of collagen XVIII, is almost exclusively found in the liver and mainly expressed by hepatocytes. Continuous capillaries contain both XV and XVIII collagen, but fenestrated capillaries (e.g. liver sinusoids, glomeruli, lung alveoli and splenic sinusoids) express only type XVIII. In our hands, endostatin had no effect on subcutaneous tumours, possibly because the outgrowth of these tumours does not depend on cell seeding (data not shown; see also). We could speculate that endostatin action in the liver is mediated by dominant-negative competition with its precursor. Such insights into organ specificity might be useful in the design of future clinical trials. Furthermore, since we found optimal antitumour effects even as early as within 15 min after intrasplenic tumour cell injection, endostatin prophylaxis might prove very promising to augment surgical treatment of colorectal carcinoma and liver metastases. Even in no-touch surgery, preventing metastatic seeding and combined with mesenterical vessel ligation, 12.5% of patients have detectable tumour spill in the circulation. Overall, as many as 75% of colorectal cancer patients develop liver metastases. In this respect, it is worth mentioning that clinical trials in patients with established metastatic disease have shown that endostatin, although well tolerated, generated marginal tumour responses. Others also found that the efficacy of endostatin improved when administered before tumour cell injection, as measured by tumour load 21 days following tumour cell injection.correspondingly showed that endostatin, among others, was capable of treating early stages of cancer. Finally, in vivo endostatin gene transfection with a cationic lipid inhibited the outgrowth of fibrosarcoma cells as pulmonary metastases and this was most effective when treatment was started prior to tumour cell inoculation. Taken together, it seems likely that endostatin efficacy will be optimal when administered during the early stages of the disease. Therefore, the antitumour activity of endostatin should be further tested in patients with minimal or microscopic metastatic disease. In vitro studies provide evidence to support an early effect of endostatin: disassembly of focal adhesions and actin stress fibres in endothelial cells in vitro was described to be already visible 1 h after endostatin administration. In addition, early-response genes responsible for cell–matrix interactions were downregulated rapidly after endostatin treatment.

### The multifaceted role of the microenvironment in liver metastasis: biology and clinical implications [^c73d5b2e]. Cancer Research (2013). Low credibility.

The liver is host to many metastatic cancers, particularly colorectal cancer, for which the last 2 decades have seen major advances in diagnosis and treatment. The liver is a vital organ, and the extent of its involvement with metastatic disease is a major determinant of survival. Metastatic cells arriving in the liver via the bloodstream encounter the microenvironment of the hepatic sinusoid. The interactions of the tumor cells with hepatic sinusoidal and extrasinusoidal cells (endothelial, Kupffer, stellate, and inflammatory cells) determine their fate. The sinusoidal cells can have a dual role, sometimes fatal to the tumor cells but also facilitatory to their survival and growth. Adhesion molecules participate in these interactions and may affect their outcome. Bone marrow-derived cells and chemokines also play a part in the early battle for survival of the metastases. Once the tumor cells have arrested and survived the initial onslaught, tumors can grow within the liver in 3 distinct patterns, reflecting differing host responses, mechanisms of vascularization, and proteolytic activity. This review aims to present current knowledge of the interactions between the host liver cells and the invading metastases that has implications for the clinical course of the disease and the response to treatment.

### Extracellular vesicles targeting non-parenchymal cells: the therapeutical effect on liver fibrosis [^47f06f3c]. Egastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Fibrosis is considered a dynamic and reversible process termed fibrosis resolution/regression when the underlying causes are eliminated. Coculturing differentiated LSECs with activated HSCs and using an sGC activator to maintain LSEC differentiation can lead to the reversion of activated HSCs back to a quiescent state. sGC participates in VEGF stimulation of NO-dependent signalling with increased eNOS expression to promote hepatic EC-dependent regression of liver fibrosis. Moreover, LSECs coordinate immune cell recruitment and actively participate in the endocytosis and clearance of denatured collagen-α chains. In summary, LSECs play a crucial role in fibrosis resolution.

During development of liver fibrosis, non-parenchymal cells play an important role in many ways (figure 1).

Figure 1
Phenotypic changes in non-parenchymal cells during development of liver fibrosis. In response to chronic stimuli such as alcohol abuse, viral infection, NAFLD/NASH and toxic damage, liver loses its normal structure and non-parenchymal cells including HSCs, KCs and LSECs undergo phenotypic changes. HSCs and KCs are in activation and LSECs become capillarised with loss of fenestrae and markers followed by release of fibrogenic stimuli such as TGF-β, LOX and so on, which play important roles in the development of liver fibrosis.

### Transcriptional dynamics of hepatic sinusoid-associated cells after liver injury [^95451ef7]. Hepatology (2020). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, our study offers a comprehensive molecular account of drug‐induced injury of the mammalian liver and highlights the power of single‐cell resolution in elucidating complex biological systems. By dissecting sinusoidal cell populations, we mapped transitions of individual cell types upon injury and interactions between their subpopulations. Combining single‐cell transcriptomics with WGCNA, we identified key HSC genes that may play important roles in human sinusoidal integrity and serve as composite markers of advanced fibrosis in patients.

### Ethanol binging exacerbates sinusoidal endothelial and parenchymal injury elicited by acetaminophen [^acd9ca4d]. Journal of Hepatology (2005). Low credibility.

Background/Aims

The pathophysiology of binge drinking of ethanol and its potentiation of acetaminophen (APAP) toxicity has received very little attention. To evaluate if ethanol binging sensitizes hepatic sinusoidal endothelial cells (SEC) and liver to APAP toxicity.

Methods

The histopathological responses to APAP were evaluated in the livers of mice gavaged with APAP alone, following a single, week-end type ethanol binge (4 g/kg every 12 h x 5 doses) or three weekly binges.

Results

Six hours after APAP, 600 mg/kg elicited severe centrilobular necrosis together with hemorrhagic congestion and infiltration of erythrocytes into the Space of Disse through large gaps that had formed in SEC. There was no evidence of parenchymal injury at 2 h, but gaps already were formed through the cytoplasm of the SEC by coalescence of fenestrae. A single binge followed by 300 mg/kg APAP elicited SEC and parenchymal injury equivalent to 600 mg/kg APAP alone at 2 and 6 h. The responses were exacerbated following three binges. Lower glutathione levels in the liver were shown in ethanol-binged animals.

Conclusions

Ethanol binging increases APAP hepatotoxicity. SEC are an early target for APAP-induced injury and ethanol binging enhances the SEC injury prior to evidence of parenchymal cell injury.

### Human liver sinusoidal endothelial cells promote intracellular crawling of lymphocytes during recruitment: a new step in migration [^4e8bb2da]. Hepatology (2017). Low credibility.

Why should intracellular lymphocyte migration be a characteristic of hepatic sinusoidal endothelium? One explanation may be the important role played by sinusoidal endothelium in the liver in removing particulates and other factors that constantly enter the liver from the gut via the portal vein. Hepatic sinusoidal endothelium expresses a large number of scavenger receptors that are not found on vascular endothelium and has the capability to remove, internalize, and process or degrade a range of antigens. It also plays an important role in determining the nature of the adaptive immune response to such antigens by inducing antigen‐specific tolerance in T lymphocytes. It is thus possible that the intracellular migration we have observed contributes to this function by allowing lymphocytes to perform immune surveillance for intracellular pathogens.

Our findings may also demonstrate a key step in the lymphocyte migratory route through the liver. Lymphocytes continually recirculate through the liver under steady‐state conditions. Although hepatic sinusoids have been established as the major site of leukocyte recruitment, the migratory route taken by lymphocytes through the liver is poorly understood. Different zones within the hepatic acinus are associated with different hepatocyte functions defined by differential expression of, for instance, cytochrome P450 enzymes. Lymphocytes may thus need to be directed to particular compartments within the hepatic parenchyma to provide efficient detection and clearance of pathogens or harmful antigens. Furthermore, most forms of hepatitis are associated with a portal infiltrate even when the presumed antigen is confined to hepatocytes (e.g. viral hepatitis or autoimmune hepatitis). Kinetic studies in experimental models have demonstrated that lymphocytes migrate from the hepatic sinusoids to the portal tract and then drain to hepatic lymph nodes. 34 During chronic inflammatory diseases lymphocyte recruitment increases often leading to portal infiltrates. 35 However, the route taken by lymphocytes from the sinusoids to the portal tracts is not known. Migration from the hepatic sinusoids to the portal tract may occur via the space of Disse, the subendothelial layer containing the hepatic pericyte or stellate cell, and this appears to be the route taken by activated dendritic cells to exit the liver parenchyma and enter portal tracts. Our findings suggest that lymphocytes may also crawl intracellularly from endothelial cell to endothelial cell toward the portal regions. This route may become more relevant during chronic disease when collagen accumulates in the space of Disse, which may make it difficult for lymphocytes to use this pathway to portal tracts. The fact that we saw a marked increase in intravascular crawling in HSECs treated with a combination of TNFα and IFNγ supports a particular role in inflammation. We therefore believe this novel finding provides a new insight into lymphocyte migration and could lead to new treatments for inflammatory liver diseases.

### Three-dimensional ultrastructure of capillary endothelial glycocalyx under normal and experimental endotoxemic conditions [^7294d627]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Sugar-protein glycocalyx coats healthy endothelium, but its ultrastructure is not well described. Our aim was to determine the three-dimensional ultrastructure of capillary endothelial glycocalyx in the heart, kidney, and liver, where capillaries are, respectively, continuous, fenestrated, and sinusoidal.

Methods

Tissue samples were processed with lanthanum-containing alkaline fixative, which preserves the structure of glycocalyx.

Results

Scanning and transmission electron microscopy revealed that the endothelial glycocalyx layer in continuous and fenestrated capillaries was substantially thicker than in sinusoids. In the heart, the endothelial glycocalyx presented as moss- or broccoli-like and covered the entire luminal endothelial cell surface. In the kidney, the glycocalyx appeared to nearly occlude the endothelial pores of the fenestrated capillaries and was also present on the surface of the renal podocytes. In sinusoids of the liver, glycocalyx covered not only the luminal side but also the opposite side, facing the space of Disse. In a mouse lipopolysaccharide-induced experimental endotoxemia model, the capillary endothelial glycocalyx was severely disrupted; that is, it appeared to be peeling off the cells and clumping. Serum concentrations of syndecan-1, a marker of glycocalyx damage, were significantly increased 24 h after administration of lipopolysaccharide.

Conclusions

In the present study, we visualized the three-dimensional ultrastructure of endothelial glycocalyx in healthy continuous, fenestrated, and sinusoidal capillaries, and we also showed their disruption under experimental endotoxemic conditions. The latter may provide a morphological basis for the microvascular endothelial dysfunction associated with septic injury to organs.

### Microfluidic platform accelerates tissue processing into single cells for molecular analysis and primary culture models [^17053023]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Taken together, the performance of the microfluidic processing platform with liver was quite unique relative to kidney and tumor. We believe that this caused by the fact that fluid shear forces are needed to break down tissue, but can also damage some cell types that have already been liberated. All tissues require proper balancing of these effects. For softer tissues like liver, the balance must be shifted away from breakdown and toward preservation, particularly for sensitive hepatocytes, which can be accomplished using interval recovery. Endothelial cells and leukocytes also exhibited some sensitivity to over-processing, although to a lesser degree. It is unclear whether this finding can be generalized to other tissues, including kidney and tumor. Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells are highly specialized, with abundant fenestrae and no underlying basement membrane. These properties could also make sinusoidal endothelial cells particularly sensitive to damage. For leukocytes, we did not distinguish between those that originated within the liver, which would predominantly be Kupffer cells, from those that came from blood, which may be less sensitive to shear. Future studies directly assessing Kupffer cells, as well as hepatic stellate cells, would be of high interest, particularly to make progress toward complex liver models that utilize multiple cell types.

Heart failure is another leading cause of drug withdrawal from the market, combining with liver failure to account for ~70% of withdrawals. Thus, there is robust interest in developing heart-on-chip technologies using primary cardiomyocytes for preclinical drug screening. Cardiomyocytes have been shown to be highly sensitive to mechanical and enzymatic dissociation techniques. In addition, they are disproportionately long in one direction, on the order of 100 μm or more. For these experiments, murine heart was minced into ~1 mm 3 pieces and cardiomyocytes were detected based on Troponin T expression. Since Troponin T is an intracellular marker, we used a fixable viability dye, Zombie Violet, in place of 7-AAD. Given potential concerns about cardiomyocyte size and shape, we first tested the effect of filter pore size in the integrated dissociation/filtration device. After 15 min processing with the minced digestion device, sample was passed through the original integrated dissociation/filter device with both 50 and 15 µm pore size membranes or the modified version with only the 50 μm membrane. Cell numbers and viability were similar for all conditions (see Supplementary Information, Supplementary Fig. S17), and thus we selected to use the original version with both membranes for heart tissue.

### Human liver sinusoidal endothelial cells promote intracellular crawling of lymphocytes during recruitment: a new step in migration [^35da7d76]. Hepatology (2017). Low credibility.

Chronic inflammation is a major cause of global morbidity and mortality, often leading to tissue fibrosis and organ failure, and is also a recognized risk factor for carcinogenesis. 1, 2, 3, 4 It is characterized by the recruitment of immune cells into organs via their interaction with endothelial cells followed by their positioning in strategic locations within the tissue. 5 This is seen in nearly all adult liver diseases that are driven by chronic inflammation, where leukocytes are recruited via specialized channels known as sinusoids, which are lined by hepatic sinusoidal endothelial cells (HSECs). 6 This influx of immune cells often leads to lymphoid aggregates/follicles around the portal tract in a range of liver diseases. 7

Despite this common pathway of chronic inflammation, several features contribute to the liver being a unique site for leukocyte recruitment. The extravasation occurs within the hepatic sinusoidal channels in contrast to the postcapillary venules as seen in most other organs. 8, 9 These channels are characterized by a low flow environment, and the sinusoidal endothelium (i.e. HSECs) has a unique morphology and performs specialized functions including scavenging and filtration. 10 Conventional adhesion molecules, such as selectins which mediate leukocyte rolling, are absent from this vascular bed, and recruitment is mediated by atypical adhesion molecules such as vascular adhesion protein‐1 and the common lymphatic endothelial and vascular endothelial receptor‐1 (CLEVER‐1) also known as stabilin‐1. 11, 12

The aim of this study was to perform a detailed analysis of the transendothelial pathway used by lymphocytes to cross human liver sinusoidal endothelium to identify organ‐specific targets of chronic inflammation within the liver. We developed real‐time cell imaging by laser scanning confocal microscopy under conditions of physiologically relevant shear stress to visualize the migration of lymphocytes across HSECs. We visualized lymphocyte migration into the cytoplasm of HSECs from where the cells crossed junctional membranes to allow them to crawl from within one HSEC into another. We noted this process more frequently in HSECs compared with conventional vascular endothelium and found it was enhanced by interferon‐γ (IFNγ) treatment of the endothelium. Although crawling of leukocytes on the luminal surface has been described previously, 13 we believe this is the first description of "intracellular crawling," which may play an important role in leukocyte recruitment and positioning within the liver.

### Spatial dimension of macrophage heterogeneity in liver diseases [^fa79e184]. Egastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Spatial localisation as a novel phenotypic marker

The liver anatomical location matters for its function in the organism. Also, at a cellular scale, hepatocyte spatial zonation has been well described and shown to be essential for liver metabolic functions. This is increasingly recognised as true for liver macrophages as well. Their location within the hepatic lobules appears to be intrinsically linked to KC subpopulation functions. As such, KCs are located within the liver sinusoids and harbour numerous cytoplasmic expansions within the sinusoids, and prolonged through the space of Disse to as far as the hepatocytic cellular layers. As a consequence, KCs are ideally located not only to sense changes occurring in the bloodstream (eg, pathogens, toxins), but also hepatocyte stress. This goes along with their attributed functions in organ immune tolerance and acute response. Interestingly, KCs are also subject to varying spatial distribution in the centrilobular–portal axis. Indeed, Gola et al evidenced that murine KCs are specifically accumulating around the portal areas during weaning of offspring mice from their mothers, a phenomenon absent in germ-free mice or in mice with a defect in MyD88 signalling in liver sinusoidal endothelial cells, revealing its dependence on gut-derived microbial antigens. Their manuscript also suggested that KC zonation was crucial to the control of pathogen dissemination. While it is recognised that distinct subpopulations of KCs coexist even at steady state, their differential distribution remains to be demonstrated on a larger scale for in-depth understanding of the functional zonation of KCs, despite a study previously reporting that at least two major KC populations are evenly distributed in overlapping regions.

Contrastingly, MoMFs are circulating through the blood sinusoids and the larger blood vessels, and are of smaller sizes and lower shape complexity, as compared with KCs. Noteworthy, a population of macrophages, mostly derived from bone marrow-derived macrophages, seem to home to the vicinity of bile ducts in the healthy liver. This particular localisation may define them as primary responders to bile duct leakage or portal vein-borne pathogens, although they were shown to be less responsive than KCs to Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 stimulation. In the healthy liver, a small population of these portal area-located macrophages were identified as 'lipid-associated macrophages' (LAMs) due to their similarities with macrophages accumulating during liver steatosis. In the same line, spatial transcriptomics applied to healthy livers revealed a zonation of liver macrophages, with the subpopulations present in the centrilobular areas exhibiting a more proinflammatory phenotype than the macrophages located near the portal areas.

### Sinusoidal and lymphatic vessel growth is controlled by reciprocal VEGF-C-CDH5 inhibition [^1c90ebad]. Nature Cardiovascular Research (2022). High credibility.

Sinusoids are specialized, low pressure blood vessels in the liver, bone marrow, and spleen required for definitive hematopoiesis. Unlike other blood endothelial cells (ECs), sinusoidal ECs express high levels of VEGFR3. VEGFR3 and its ligand VEGF-C are known to support lymphatic growth, but their function in sinusoidal vessels is unknown. In this study, we define a reciprocal VEGF-C/VEGFR3-CDH5 (VE-cadherin) signaling axis that controls growth of both sinusoidal and lymphatic vessels. Loss of VEGF-C or VEGFR3 resulted in cutaneous edema, reduced fetal liver size, and bloodless bone marrow due to impaired lymphatic and sinusoidal vessel growth. Mice with membrane-retained VE-cadherin conferred identical lymphatic and sinusoidal defects, suggesting that VE-cadherin opposes VEGF-C/VEGFR3 signaling. In developing mice, loss of VE-cadherin rescued defects in sinusoidal and lymphatic growth caused by loss of VEGFR3 but not loss of VEGF-C, findings explained by potentiated VEGF-C/VEGFR2 signaling in VEGFR3-deficient lymphatic ECs. Mechanistically, VEGF-C/VEGFR3 signaling induces VE-cadherin endocytosis and loss of function via SRC-mediated phosphorylation, while VE-cadherin prevents VEGFR3 endocytosis required for optimal receptor signaling. These findings establish an essential role for VEGF-C/VEGFR3 signaling during sinusoidal vascular growth, identify VE-cadherin as a powerful negative regulator of VEGF-C signaling that acts through both VEGFR3 and VEGFR2 receptors, and suggest that negative regulation of VE-cadherin is required for effective VEGF-C/VEGFR3 signaling during growth of sinusoidal and lymphatic vessels. Manipulation of this reciprocal negative regulatory mechanism, e.g. by reducing VE-cadherin function, may be used to stimulate therapeutic sinusoidal or lymphatic vessel growth.

### Spatial dimension of macrophage heterogeneity in liver diseases [^41c64d7c]. Egastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

The specificities of the liver microenvironment driving Kupffer cell functions

Kupffer cells (KCs) represent the liver resident macrophages, which derive from embryonic liver precursors. KCs' uniqueness resides in their ability to contribute to the liver metabolic functions, notably by participating in lipid and iron metabolism, and their crucial roles in supporting liver regeneration. In addition, the liver is populated by multiple monocyte and macrophage populations, such as capsular or peritoneal macrophages. However, in most acute and chronic liver diseases, two main populations are drawing a lot of interest due to their complementary functions: the liver resident macrophages (KCs) and the monocyte-derived macrophages (MoMFs). KCs originate from embryonic liver progenitors and are capable of self-renewing. They are located within the hepatic blood sinusoids and present long cytoplasmic expansions allowing them to sense blood content changes. KCs are also characterised by potent phagocytic capacities, regarded as the immune system sentinels, able to drive a rapid immune response on tissue injury, lipid exposure or PAMP stimulation, but also making them responsible for detrimental compounds trapping in the liver and making them a privileged port of entry for liver-targeted interventions. Nonetheless, KC-driven response is believed to be mostly immune-tolerant, which is regarded as a protective mechanism against excessive immune response towards harmless antigens during homeostasis.

On acute and specific depletion of KCs in mice, MoMFs are recruited to acquire a KC-like phenotype. This generation of 'bone marrow-derived KCs' is driven by multiple signals, such as chemokines, growth factors and adherence proteins, expressed by hepatocytes, liver sinusoidal endothelial cells and hepatic stellate cells. All these events occur within a few hours, defining a 'transient window' of niche availability. During homeostasis, MoMFs patrol the liver through the hepatic sinusoids. However, in most settings of tissue injury, MoMFs originating from the bone marrow are recruited to the liver. MoMFs are characterised by their enormous plasticity, making them a myeloid cell population with a wide range of functions and a broad phenotypic diversity.

### Liver fibrosis negatively impacts in vivo gene transfer to murine hepatocytes [^d7bf9730]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

The different gene transfer outcomes observed in our fibrosis models may also depend on the underlying pathogenic mechanisms and specific cell responses. Primarily, chronic activation of the fibrogenic pathway leads to an altered tissue structure due to changes in the composition and distribution of the extracellular matrix throughout the liver lobules. The deposition of collagen, alterations of structures like endothelial fenestrae, and induction of neo-angiogenesis result in higher pressure on the liver microvasculature, causing portal hypertension and changes in overall blood flow. In turn, this leads to abnormal circulation of substances between blood vessels and the liver parenchyma. All these changes could hamper the physical accessibility of the viral vectors to hepatocytes when administered systemically. Notably, LV and AAV vectors have different sizes, approximately 120 nm and 25 nm, respectively. Therefore, a physical barrier may inhibit more strongly LV rather than AAV vector delivery to hepatocytes. However, our finding that periportal liver fibrosis inhibited both LV and AAV vector gene transfer supports that other mechanisms contribute to transduction impairment. Interestingly, we observed an overall change in the zonation of gene transfer in the presence of liver damage, and even when transduction was not reduced per se. Regarding LV, the periportal transduction bias was reduced in the case of periportal fibrosis (DDC-induced, Abcb11 −/−, Agl −/−). This may be due to the collagen deposition restricting access to periportal hepatocytes. However, also in the context of CCl 4 -induced pericentral fibrosis, the periportal LV transduction was reduced. This observation may be explained by an overall alteration of the liver metabolism following CCl 4 chronic administration, which reduced the transduction of periportal hepatocytes, even if they were not near the area of collagen deposition. The AAV serotype 8 pericentral bias of transduction was maintained in the presence of CCl 4 and DDC-induced fibrosis. The DDC diet impaired transduction overall, independently on the lobule area. On the other hand, in Abcb11 −/− mice, the pericentral bias appeared to increase, while in Agl −/− mice, it decreased. The overall changes in zonation of transduction in the tested models may be due to alteration of the metabolic state of the liver rather than to a simple physical barrier caused by extracellular matrix deposition. In this regard, an altered metabolic state of hepatocytes and other liver cells may also affect the expression of vector receptors and impact other post-entry steps of the vector transduction process, such as capsid trafficking, nuclear import, and nucleic acid synthesis. Moreover, the presence of inflammatory cell infiltrates, as observed in most fibrosis models, may cause an increase in phagocytosis and reinforce cellular anti-viral defenses, thus leading to reduced transduction. We addressed whether LV gene transfer into hepatocytes was accompanied by increased vector clearance or skewed vector distribution to other liver cell types or tissues. However, in our experimental settings, we did not detect any change in LV clearance from the blood and no major skewing of LV transduction away from the liver or hepatocytes to other major organs or liver non-parenchymal cells. These observations might be explained by the inflammatory state of the liver impairing hepatocyte transduction without an evident increase in VCN in other cell types and tissues. Overall, our study highlights that inhibition of vector transduction is likely caused by multifactorial mechanisms driven by the liver damage occurring in the different models that we investigated.

### Semaphorin 3E secreted by damaged hepatocytes regulates the sinusoidal regeneration and liver fibrosis during liver regeneration [^7a5e419b]. The American Journal of Pathology (2014). Low credibility.

The liver has a remarkable capacity to regenerate after injury. Although the regulatory mechanisms of hepatocytic regeneration have been a subject of intense study, the dynamism of the sinusoids, specialized blood vessels in the liver, remains largely unknown. Transient activation of hepatic stellate cells and hepatic sinusoidal endothelial cells, which constitute the sinusoids, contributes to liver regeneration during acute injury, whereas their sustained activation causes liver fibrosis during chronic injury. We focused on understanding the association between damaged hepatocytes and sinusoidal regeneration or liver fibrogenesis using a carbon tetrachloride-induced liver injury mouse model. Damaged hepatocytes rapidly expressed semaphorin 3E (Sema3e), which induced contraction of sinusoidal endothelial cells and thereby contributed to activating hepatic stellate cells for wound healing. In addition, ectopic and consecutive expression of Sema3e in hepatocytes by the hydrodynamic tail-vein injection method resulted in disorganized regeneration of sinusoids and sustained activation of hepatic stellate cells. In contrast, liver fibrosis ameliorated in Sema3e-knockout mice compared with wild-type mice in a chronic liver injury model. Our results indicate that Sema3e, secreted by damaged hepatocytes, affects sinusoidal regeneration in a paracrine manner during liver regeneration, suggesting that Sema3e is a novel therapeutic target in liver fibrogenesis.

### Platelet-derived growth factor signaling through ephrin-b2 regulates hepatic vascular structure and function [^c02b6390]. Gastroenterology (2008). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Cirrhosis is associated with prominent changes in sinusoidal structure and function. Although the resident pericyte in liver, the hepatic stellate cell (HSC), is well characterized in the process of fibrogenesis, signaling pathways that regulate HSC vascular function are less developed. Because pericyte populations outside the liver are increasingly being recognized as a key cell type for angiogenesis and changes in vascular structure, in this study, we explore new HSC-signaling pathways that regulate sinusoidal structure and function.

Methods

Real-time video microscopy and quantitative software analysis of vascular tube formation were used to measure HSC angiogenesis in vitro. Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and ephrin-signaling pathways were modulated using molecular and pharmacologic techniques. Complementary whole animal studies were performed to correlate in vitro findings with pericyte functions in vivo.

Results

We show that PDGF promotes a phenotype of HSC evidenced by enhanced HSC-driven vascular tube formation in vitro and enhanced HSC coverage of sinusoids in vivo. This angiogenic phenotype modulates specific pericyte vascular functions including permeability and pressure regulation. Furthermore, we identify a key role for ephrin-B2 as a downstream effector of PDGF signaling.

Conclusions

These studies elucidate novel HSC-signaling pathways that regulate microvascular structure and function in liver.

Reduced hepatic uptake of CLF after BDL. (A) Mice at 3 and 21 days post‐BDL as well as sham‐operated controls received intravenous injections of CLF. Subsequently, CLF is seen in the sinusoids, liver sinusoidal endothelial cells/Disse space, cytoplasm of hepatocytes, and bile canaliculi of controls (upper panel). At day 3 post‐BDL (middle panel) uptake of CLF through the sinusoidal membrane is strongly reduced, but export to the bile canaliculus is still active. At day 21 after BDL sinusoidal CLF uptake is blocked to such a degree that almost no increase of green fluorescence can be detected in hepatocytes and in bile canaliculi.

### Cell atlas of the regenerating human liver after portal vein embolization [^eb62036c]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

We observed differential abundance of pericentral LSEC populations, with more cycling cells and high mitochondrial content cells in the regenerating condition, and an enrichment of interferon and ANGPT2+ remodeling cells in the embolized condition (Fig. 4e). Pseudozonation trajectory alignment to the healthy reference suggested a moderate shift towards pericentral identity in the regenerating liver, whereas LSECs from embolized samples had a slight inclination towards a periportal expression pattern (Fig. 4f, Supplementary Fig. 11a, b). Regenerating and embolized LSEC, when compared to healthy, both upregulated genes related to developmental, cell adhesion, and migration programs (Supplementary Fig. 11c, d). Zonation of various genes also differed between conditions (Supplementary Fig. 11e, Supplementary Data 6), yet these did not translate into any enriched GO Terms.

Projection of LSEC populations to the healthy pseudozonation reference revealed that remodeling, interferon-high, and stress-associated LSECs primarily map pericentrally, while fenestrated LSECs had a predominantly periportal signature (Fig. 4g). Fenestrated cells had a strong matching signature to scar-associated (SA) endothelial cells with a strong pro-fibrinogenic signature(Supplementary Fig. 11f), highlighting potential fibrosis appearing near portal vessels in the post-PVE liver.

### A bile duct-on-a-chip with organ-level functions [^f510f232]. Hepatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Chronic cholestatic liver diseases, such as primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) and primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), are often associated with alterations in the tight junctions of bile duct epithelial cells (cholangiocytes). Data from mouse models similarly suggest that impaired tight junction integrity plays an important role in the pathogenesis of cholangiopathies. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 Most in vitro research on biliary physiology and pathology, however, uses cells either cultured in two‐dimensional (2D) monolayers or as organoids in three‐dimensional (3D) extracellular matrix (ECM). 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 These conventional methods fail to replicate many key aspects of bile duct structural organization or to recapitulate important tissue‐level integrated physiological functions, such as forming a protective barrier and compartmentalizing bile.

Microfluidic organs‐on‐chips can overcome some of these limitations. 12 Soft lithography, which is used to design organs‐on‐chips, allows control of surface features over a range of physiologically relevant scales. Organs‐on‐chips can mimic aspects of the physiology of cell‐cell and cell‐ECM junctions in tissues, including the alveolar‐capillary interface, 13 the blood–brain barrier, 14, 15, 16 and liver sinusoids, 17 in a controllable way, allowing both high‐resolution imaging and biochemical and metabolic analyses in real time. The technology has great potential to advance the study of tissue development, physiology, and pathophysiology.

To capture the structure and environment of the bile ducts, we used organ‐on‐chip technology with a microengineered bile duct with controllable architecture and surrounding matrix. We demonstrate that a self‐organized cholangiocyte‐lined channel faithfully recapitulates key functions of the bile duct and enables us to study the barrier function of the cholangiocyte monolayer quantitatively and independently from either the apical or basolateral side. As a proof of concept, we use this model to show that the cholangiocyte apical glycocalyx plays a protective role and to demonstrate, through changes in cholangiocyte calcium flux in response to applied luminal flow, that cholangiocytes are mechanosensitive.

### Nucleic acid spheres for treating capillarisation of liver sinusoidal endothelial cells in liver fibrosis [^c9a57d23]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

In this work, a fundamental mechanism underlying the reversal of LSEC capillarization by MSCs has been unveiled with the assistance of artificial intelligence (AI). Herein, MSCs intricately secrete miR-325-3p to modulate the cytoskeleton of LSECs, thereby reinstating their fenestrations and sieve plate structures at differentiation state. Based on this foundation, a spherical nucleic acid (SNAs) targeting LSEC was ingeniously crafted by assembling sulfhydryl and Au(I)-modified miR-325-3p into a mesmerizing spheroid polyhedron measuring approximately 39 nm through the captivating phenomenon of aurophilic interaction. Thanks to two remarkable factors: 1) the highly specific overexpression of scavenger receptor A (Scara) in hepatic fibrotic LSECs and 2) the Scara's exceptional affinity for spherical nucleic acids, SNAs selectively infiltrates into LSECs. More significantly, SNAS effectively reversed the capillarization of liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSEC) and exhibited remarkable therapeutic efficacy in three mouse models of liver fibrosis, encompassing oxidative stress-induced fibrosis caused by carbon tetrachloride (CCl 4), drug toxicity-induced fibrosis induced by thioacetamide (TAA), and cholestasis-derived fibrosis induced by bile duct ligation (BDL). Importantly, these beneficial effects were accompanied by a maintained favorable biosafety profile. The development and translation of this SNAs into clinical applications, so to speak, has the potential to revolutionize the management of liver fibrosis, offering newfound hope for patients suffering from chronic liver diseases.

### Sinusoidal obstruction syndrome / veno-occlusive disease: current situation and perspectives-a position statement from the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) [^b2595d83]. Bone Marrow Transplantation (2015). Low credibility.

Pathophysiology

It is now clearly established that the first morphological change in SOS/VOD occurs in the sinusoidal endothelial cells, leading to the obstruction of the hepatic sinusoids in the zone 3 of the hepatic acinus (Figure 1). Endothelial cell lesions after HSCT are not limited to those lining the sinusoids and can lead to a wide range of endothelial syndromes early after transplant, including SOS/VOD, capillary leak syndrome, engraftment syndrome, transplant-associated microangiopathy or diffuse alveolar hemorrhage.

The proposed hypothesis to explain the SOS/VOD pathophysiology during HSCT is that sinusoidal endothelial cells can be activated and damaged by factors such as the chemotherapy or radiotherapy included in the conditioning regimen, cytokines produced by the injured tissues, endogenous microbial products translocated through damaged mucosal barriers, drugs used during the procedure (such as granulocyte colony-stimulating factors or calcineurin inhibitors), and the complex process of engraftment. All these factors produce a physiological activation of the endothelial cells (Figure 2a); however, if they are intense and sustained, such activation can evolve to endothelial damage: sinusoidal endothelial cells round up, favoring the appearance of gaps in the sinusoidal barrier(Figure 2b). These changes facilitate the egress of RBCs, leucocytes and cellular debris into the space of Disse beneath the endothelial cells and dissect the endothelial lining (Figure 2c). Finally, the sloughed sinusoidal lining embolizes downstream and obstructs sinusoidal flow (Figure 2d). In these early stages, histological examinations show thickening of the subintimal zone, which leads to the narrowing of the venular lumen and an increased resistance to blood flow. This contributes to the post-sinusoidal portal hypertension, worsening liver dysfunction and ascites seen in the disease, eventually resulting in multi-organ failure (characterized by pulmonary and renal dysfunction, as well as encephalopathy) and death.

### Hepatic microcirculation and mechanisms of portal hypertension [^701782f1]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2019). High credibility.

The liver microcirculatory milieu, mainly composed of liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs), hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) and hepatic macrophages, has an essential role in liver homeostasis, including in preserving hepatocyte function, regulating the vascular tone and controlling inflammation. Liver microcirculatory dysfunction is one of the key mechanisms that promotes the progression of chronic liver disease (also termed cirrhosis) and the development of its major clinical complication, portal hypertension. In the present Review, we describe the current knowledge of liver microcirculatory dysfunction in cirrhotic portal hypertension and appraise the preclinical models used to study the liver circulation. We also provide a comprehensive summary of the promising therapeutic options to target the liver microvasculature in cirrhosis.

### Human liver sinusoidal endothelial cells promote intracellular crawling of lymphocytes during recruitment: a new step in migration [^c31c0d95]. Hepatology (2017). Low credibility.

The recruitment of lymphocytes via the hepatic sinusoidal channels and positioning within liver tissue is a critical event in the development and persistence of chronic inflammatory liver diseases. The hepatic sinusoid is a unique vascular bed lined by hepatic sinusoidal endothelial cells (HSECs), a functionally and phenotypically distinct subpopulation of endothelial cells. Using flow-based adhesion assays to study the migration of lymphocytes across primary human HSECs, we found that lymphocytes enter into HSECs, confirmed by electron microscopy demonstrating clear intracellular localization of lymphocytes in vitro and by studies in human liver tissues. Stimulation by interferon-γ increased intracellular localization of lymphocytes within HSECs. Furthermore, using confocal imaging and time-lapse recordings, we demonstrated "intracellular crawling" of lymphocytes entering into one endothelial cell from another. This required the expression of intracellular adhesion molecule-1 and stabilin-1 and was facilitated by the junctional complexes between HSECs.

Conclusion

Lymphocyte migration is facilitated by the unique structure of HSECs. Intracellular crawling may contribute to optimal lymphocyte positioning in liver tissue during chronic hepatitis. (Hepatology 2017;65:294–309).
