## Question

Treatment fibrosarcoma

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how to treat fibrosarcoma. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to classify fibrosarcoma by subtype and age group because treatment hinges on these distinctions. Then, I should verify the role of surgery and whether the extent of resection affects survival. Next, I will examine when and how to use radiotherapy, including sequencing and hypofractionation. After that, I need to check systemic therapy options, including NTRK-directed therapy for infantile fibrosarcoma and cytotoxic chemotherapy for adult-type disease. I will then consider special scenarios like radiation-induced fibrosarcoma and cardiac or intracranial primaries. Finally, I should integrate multidisciplinary care, prognostic factors, and follow-up into a practical algorithm, making sure each step aligns with guideline-level evidence and key studies [^111pbhYT] [^116GdUCH] [^1173RwAR].

> Let me first confirm the classification framework because treatment diverges substantially by subtype and age. Infantile fibrosarcoma (IFS) typically presents in infants, often harbors NTRK fusions, and is chemo-sensitive, whereas adult-type fibrosarcoma behaves more like other high-grade soft tissue sarcomas and is managed per adult STS algorithms; dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans with fibrosarcomatous change (DFSP-FS) is a cutaneous entity with distinct surgical and targeted considerations, and radiation-induced fibrosarcoma carries a particularly aggressive biology and worse prognosis, which I should keep in mind as I weigh options [^115UMWv6] [^115xTTv8] [^113NvBud] [^111oEU3y].

> I will now examine the role of surgery, since I need to ensure I'm not overextending resection when it won't change outcomes. Wait, let me verify whether radical resection improves survival in pediatric fibrosarcoma; a large SEER analysis found that radical resection was not an independent predictor of survival in localized or regional disease, suggesting that function-sparing, margin-appropriate surgery is preferred over overly aggressive mutilating approaches, especially in infants where mutilation should be avoided when possible [^112A6cup]. Hold on, I should also check whether secondary R0/R1 resection helps after initial incomplete excision; CWS data indicate that secondary R0/R1 resection improves event-free and overall survival in adult-type pediatric fibrosarcoma but not in infants, reinforcing a more conservative stance in IFS and a more aggressive salvage strategy in older children with residual disease [^113SWrtb]. For DFSP-FS, complete excision with micrographically controlled surgery is recommended when available, with wide local excision as an alternative, and I should confirm that margins are prioritized over width when anatomy limits clearance [^1152AdPU] [^111VTqsc].

> Next, I should review radiotherapy indications and sequencing, and I need to be careful not to overgeneralize from adult data to pediatrics. For adult extremity/trunk STS, ASTRO recommends preoperative RT over postoperative RT when RT is indicated, balancing local control against wound complications; however, pediatric fibrosarcoma cohorts show excellent long-term survival with surgery ± chemotherapy and relatively selective RT use, so I should avoid routine RT in children unless there are adverse features or positive margins after maximal surgery [^116su96B] [^112A6cup]. Let me double-check scenarios where RT can be omitted: small, low-grade, superficial tumors with widely negative margins can often be managed with surgery alone, and nomograms can help estimate recurrence risk to guide omission decisions; conversely, unplanned excisions or adverse pathologic features favor postoperative RT or, when feasible, preoperative RT to improve resectability and reduce late fibrosis [^116UJBMT] [^116su96B]. I should also note emerging hypofractionated preoperative regimens (for example, 30 Gy in 5 fractions) that achieve high local control with acceptable toxicity, though pediatric-specific data are limited and extrapolation requires caution [^113sbryp].

> Now, I need to check systemic therapy, and I must distinguish IFS from adult-type disease because the biology and evidence differ. For IFS, NTRK fusion positivity is common, and larotrectinib produces very high response rates and facilitates limb- or organ-sparing surgery; frontline larotrectinib is now supported by pediatric trials and expert recommendations, with response-adapted durations and careful integration with surgical local control, and I should confirm NTRK status early in unresectable or mutilating cases [^115xTTv8] [^112Ux13g]. But wait, what if TRK inhibition is contraindicated or ineffective? Case-based evidence suggests VEGFR/PDGFR inhibitors like pazopanib can induce necrosis and enable resection in select IFS, though this remains investigational and should be individualized in a multidisciplinary setting [^1124vreR]. For adult-type fibrosarcoma, I should verify that doxorubicin-based regimens remain the cytotoxic backbone, with ifosfamide considered in fit patients when tumor shrinkage is desirable; however, pediatric series show high chemosensitivity in IFS but more limited benefit in adult-type disease, so chemotherapy should be tailored to histology, grade, and resectability [^116JgyWB].

> I will now examine special scenarios, starting with radiation-induced fibrosarcoma, because I need to ensure I don't under-treat these aggressive tumors. Compared with sporadic fibrosarcoma, RIF presents later, is less often amenable to surgery, and has significantly worse disease-specific survival; thus, aggressive multimodal therapy and early referral to sarcoma centers are warranted, and I should maintain a high index of suspicion for new masses in prior radiation fields even outside typical latency windows [^111oEU3y] [^111vkcvb]. For intracranial or brainstem fibrosarcoma, gross total resection is rarely feasible; case reports describe disease control with metronomic cyclophosphamide plus imatinib after subtotal resection, but I should emphasize that this is low-level evidence and management should be individualized with neuro-oncology input [^115RJosg] [^1144dycw]. For primary cardiac fibrosarcoma, prognosis is dismal; in highly selected cases, cardiac transplantation or aggressive combined-modality approaches have achieved prolonged survival, so I should involve cardiac surgery and transplant teams early when feasible [^113Crrwb] [^1177g8z8].

> Let me consider dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans with fibrosarcomatous change, since the margin strategy and systemic options differ from conventional STS. I should confirm that micrographically controlled surgery is preferred to achieve negative margins, with imatinib considered neoadjuvantly when resection would cause unacceptable morbidity; importantly, once fibrosarcomatous transformation is present, metastatic risk rises and management should follow adult STS algorithms with multidisciplinary oversight and nodal/chest surveillance as indicated [^111VTqsc] [^113NvBud] [^111pbhYT].

> Next, I should review prognostic factors and how they shape treatment intensity. Hold on, I should verify that non-dermatofibrosarcoma histology and regional stage independently predict worse survival in pediatric cohorts, which supports more aggressive multimodal therapy in higher-risk, non-DFSP subtypes; in adults, grade, size, depth, and margin status drive recurrence risk and inform the need for adjuvant RT, while histologic subtype refines systemic choices and surveillance planning [^112A6cup] [^114cgQsh] [^116GdUCH].

> I need to ensure multidisciplinary care is embedded throughout, because sarcoma outcomes hinge on centralized, expert management. Management at high-volume sarcoma centers with dedicated MDTs improves adherence to guidelines, access to clinical trials, and coordination of surgery, RT, and systemic therapy; for adolescents and young adults, I should also consider AYA-specific pathways to optimize supportive care and survivorship [^111JKWZC] [^116GdUCH] [^111A4gbw].

> Let me synthesize a practical algorithm, and I will double-check each branch against the evidence before concluding. For infantile fibrosarcoma, confirm diagnosis and assess NTRK fusions; if resectable with acceptable function, proceed to limb-sparing surgery, and if unresectable or mutilating, use larotrectinib to induce response and then pursue definitive resection; chemotherapy can be reserved for non–NTRK-driven disease or when targeted therapy is not feasible, and RT is generally avoided in young infants unless absolutely necessary [^115xTTv8] [^112Ux13g] [^113SWrtb]. For adult-type fibrosarcoma, prioritize function-preserving surgery with negative margins; add preoperative RT for high-grade, deep, or large tumors when resectability or wound healing is a concern, and consider doxorubicin ± ifosfamide for high-risk or unresectable disease, integrating histology-specific nuances and patient fitness [^116su96B] [^116JgyWB] [^116GdUCH]. For DFSP-FS, employ micrographically controlled surgery or wide excision with attention to deep margins, consider neoadjuvant imatinib for morbidity-sparing cytoreduction, and escalate to STS algorithms if transformation is extensive or metastatic [^111VTqsc] [^113NvBud]. For RIF, pursue aggressive multimodal therapy with early sarcoma center referral given inferior outcomes, and for intracranial or cardiac primaries, coordinate neurosurgical or cardiothoracic strategies including transplantation when appropriate [^111oEU3y] [^115RJosg] [^113Crrwb].

> Finally, I should confirm follow-up and surveillance elements that vary by risk and treatment. Regular clinical examination and MRI are appropriate for local recurrence surveillance, with chest imaging for high-grade histologies and consideration of nodal basin imaging for DFSP-FS; long-term surveillance is prudent given late recurrences, and patient education about new masses in prior radiation fields is essential [^111pbhYT] [^113NvBud] [^111oEU3y].

Fibrosarcoma treatment is **multidisciplinary** and **individualized**, with surgery as the cornerstone for localized disease [^113SWrtb] and adjuvant radiotherapy for high-risk features [^116su96B]. Chemotherapy is reserved for **unresectable, metastatic, or high-grade tumors** [^116JgyWB], and targeted therapy (e.g. larotrectinib) is indicated for NTRK fusion–positive cases [^115xTTv8]. Management should be guided by **tumor grade, size, margins, and patient factors** [^114cgQsh], with close follow-up for recurrence [^116GdUCH].

---

## Surgical management

- **Primary treatment**: Wide local excision with negative margins (≥ 2 cm) is the standard for localized fibrosarcoma [^notfound].

- **Margins**: Positive margins increase recurrence risk; re-excision or adjuvant radiotherapy is recommended [^114cgQsh].

- **Extremity sparing**: Limb-sparing surgery is preferred over amputation when feasible [^112tYb6z].

---

## Radiation therapy

Radiation therapy is indicated for **high-grade tumors, positive margins, or tumors > 5 cm** [^notfound]. Preoperative radiotherapy is favored over postoperative radiotherapy when feasible [^116su96B]. Typical doses are 50–66 Gy, delivered in 1.8–2 Gy fractions [^notfound].

---

## Chemotherapy

Chemotherapy is indicated for **unresectable, metastatic, or high-grade tumors** [^1168SZbE]. Standard regimens include doxorubicin, ifosfamide, and dacarbazine [^112Y46Ym]. Response rates are modest (~20–30%), and chemotherapy is generally reserved for advanced disease [^1168SZbE].

---

## Targeted therapy

Targeted therapy includes **NTRK inhibitors** — larotrectinib or entrectinib — for NTRK fusion–positive fibrosarcoma, particularly infantile cases [^115xTTv8]. These agents achieve high response rates (~70–90%) and favorable outcomes [^notfound].

---

## Special considerations

- **Infantile fibrosarcoma**: Highly chemosensitive; chemotherapy (e.g. vincristine/actinomycin D/cyclophosphamide) is often used to facilitate limb-sparing surgery [^113SWrtb].

- **Radiation-induced fibrosarcoma**: Aggressive biology; multimodal therapy with surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy is recommended [^111oEU3y].

- **Recurrent disease**: Surgical resection is the mainstay; consider re-irradiation or systemic therapy for unresectable cases [^notfound].

---

## Follow-up and surveillance

Follow-up should include regular clinical exams and imaging (MRI/CT) every 3–6 months for the first 2–3 years, then annually. Long-term surveillance is essential because of the **risk of late recurrence** [^notfound].

---

## Prognostic factors

Prognosis is influenced by **tumor grade** (high-grade tumors have worse outcomes), **size** (larger tumors correlate with higher recurrence), and **margins** (positive margins increase recurrence risk) [^114cgQsh]. Metastasis at diagnosis significantly worsens prognosis [^1168SZbE].

---

Fibrosarcoma treatment is **multidisciplinary**, with surgery as the primary modality and adjuvant therapies tailored to risk features. Targeted therapy is effective for NTRK fusion–positive cases, and close surveillance is essential for early detection of recurrence.

### Radical resection of pediatric fibrosarcoma is not associated with survival benefit: a nationwide database analysis [^112A6cup]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Fibrosarcoma is one of the most common nonrhabdomyosarcoma soft tissue sarcomas in the pediatric population. Surgical resection is the cornerstone of treatment; however, optimal factors regarding the extent of fibrosarcoma resection in localized versus regional disease is poorly understood.

Methods

The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database was queried for patients who are 19 y old or younger with a diagnosis of fibrosarcoma from 1975 to 2016. Kaplan-Meier analyses were performed for disease-specific survival on clinical and pathologic variables. Multivariate analysis was performed based on significant predictors of disease-specific survival.

Results

There were 1290 patients (median age 13 [7–17] y) identified with fibrosarcoma. The overall survival rate at 20 y was 93%. Radical resection was performed on 22%, 40%, and 52% of patients with localized, regional, and distant Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results disease stage, respectively. Chemotherapy (P < 0.001), radiation (P < 0.001), histology (P < 0.001), and stage (P = 0.004) were significant predictors of increased mortality using univariate Kaplan-Meier analysis. Most patients (86%) with localized or regional stage who underwent radiation had fibrosarcomas of nondermatofibrosarcoma histology (P < 0.001). Dermatofibrosarcoma subtype comprised most radical resections (41%). Excluding distant stage, nondermatofibroma histology (hazard ratio 16.94, 95% confidence interval 3.77–76.01) and regional stage (hazard ratio 8.15, 95% confidence interval 2.93–22.69) were independent prognostic factors of mortality (both P < 0.001). Radical resection was not a significant independent prognostic indicator of survival.

Conclusions

Nondermatofibrosarcoma subtype is independently associated with increased mortality. Although surgery remains the mainstay of treatment, the extent of resection is not a predictor of survival for patients with the localized and regional stage of disease.

### Secondary fibrosarcoma of the brain stem treated with cyclophosphamide and imatinib [^115RJosg]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2010). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Post radiation fibrosarcomas most likely arise from the adjacent tissues which have been exposed to radiation in the process of treating the primary tumor. The treatment of these tumors is not well defined, and this severely impacts their prognosis. New research on the molecular pathology of radiation-induced brain fibrosarcoma and more targeted therapies is currently needed. Aggressive therapeutic approaches are required to maintain tumor control. We found metronomic cyclophosphamide and Imatinib to be appropriate therapeutic options for maintaining local tumor control in a patient with a very aggressive tumor. Our treatment regimen provided progression free survival for 6 months.

Regarding specific circumstances for soft tissue sarcoma, more specifically with respect to patients with dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (fibrosarcomatous transformation), EADO/EADV/EDF/UEMS 2025 guidelines recommend to perform complete surgical excision with micrographically controlled surgery for the management of fibrosarcomatous transformation. Consider performing wide-local excision with 2–3 cm safety margin if no variant of micrographically controlled surgery is available.

### Secondary fibrosarcoma of the brain stem treated with cyclophosphamide and imatinib [^111euUeR]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2010). Low credibility.

Radiation-induced fibrosarcoma has become more common in the recent years as the number of long-term survivors consistently increased with new methods of treatment. We have identified 25 cases in the literature (Table 1), where patients received radiation therapy for a pituitary adenoma. Subsequently these patients developed fibrosarcomas with a latent period of 2.5–20 years, with most of the patients developing the secondary tumor approximately 10–12 years after receiving radiation therapy for the initial tumor. From analyzing these cases, we also inferred a clinical picture of fibrosarcoma as a highly aggressive tumor, with extensive infiltration in the surrounding tissue and quick progression.

Table 1
Literature review of post irradiation fibrosarcoma cases

The surgical treatment for these tumors is highly limited — the areas the tumor extends into are not easily accessible by traditional or modern neurosurgical techniques, and the resection is limited due to the highly eloquent areas the tumor invades. Chemotherapy or additional radiation are the best options for treating these highly malignant tumors affecting the brain.

Presently no clinical trials have been conducted to define the optimal chemotherapy regimen appropriate to treat these tumors. We were able to identify in our extensive literature search only four case reports which have used chemotherapy for the treatment of secondary fibrosarcomas of the brain (see Table 2). The overall survival of the adult patients described in the case reports were similar to the one described by us. However, none of the older chemotherapy regimens contained pathway-selective drugs. The drugs used had the potential for severe side-effects and impact on the patient quality of life.

Table 2
Literature cases regarding chemotherapy treatment of fibrosarcoma

With recent advances in molecularly targeted treatments for cancers, new agents are emerging to treat different types of sarcomas. Imatinib is one molecule which is gaining acceptance in the treatment of other types of fibrosarcoma, such as dermatofibrosarcoma and soft-tissue sarcomas. Cyclophosphamide is another agent that is valuable in the treatment of brain neoplasms and has been used to treat sarcomas with some success. As the two chemotherapy agents have different targets in the neoplastic cells, their combination has a potential synergistic activity. In our case, this regimen was also very well tolerated, with no limiting toxicities.

Fibrosarcomatous transformation in dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (FS-DFSP) — if areas of transformation to fibrosarcoma or other sarcoma subtypes are identified, multidisciplinary consultation for consideration of further treatment and surveillance is recommended. FS-DFSP is associated with a higher metastasis risk. The patient should be referred to a center with expertise in management of soft tissue sarcomas, and referenced guidance notes multimodal therapy and surveillance considerations including CT of draining nodal basin and chest.

### An unusual case of secondary fibrosarcoma after treatment for breast cancer [^111vkcvb]. Gynecologic Oncology (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Post-irradiation breast sarcoma is a rare and highly aggressive tumor, associated with poor prognosis. However, the mean latent periods reported for postradiation sarcomas after treatment of breast cancer ranges from 5 to 10 years.

Case

We present a rare case of fibrosarcoma of the axilla, diagnosed 23 months after breast surgery and irradiation for medullary poorly differentiated carcinoma, treated with wide local excision with resection of the serratus anterior muscle until pleural wall.

Conclusion

This case confirm a possible early appearance of sarcoma in the irradiation field after radiotherapy. Thus, when a nodule appears in the irradiation field even if within 2 years after radiotherapy, physician should be alert for a possible sarcoma and wide biopsy with histologic confirmation is auspicable.

### Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans, version 1.2025, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^117FaRHE]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). Medium credibility.

Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP) is a rare cutaneous soft tissue sarcoma and affects an estimated 1,500 people annually in the United States. DFSP frequently exhibits extensive local infiltration. Initial treatment is through surgical excision, and care should be taken to ensure that negative margins are achieved to minimize recurrence. Although DFSP has a reported high rate of recurrence, metastasis is more uncommon. Fibrosarcomatous DFSP is an aggressive variant with an increased risk for local recurrence and metastasis. If achieving negative margins or resection is not feasible, radiation therapy or systemic treatment are options that may be considered by a multidisciplinary team. The NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines) outline recommended treatment options available for DFSP.

### Fibrosarcoma: a review and update [^112BvYHL]. Histopathology (2014). Low credibility.

Adult fibrosarcoma, defined by the World Health Organization as a 'malignant neoplasm composed of fibroblasts with variable collagen production and, in classical cases, a "herringbone" architecture', is a very rare soft tissue sarcoma. Once considered the most common adult sarcoma, the incidence of adult fibrosarcoma has declined dramatically over the past several decades. This is due to (i) evolution in the classification of soft tissue tumours (ii) recognition of clinically, morphologically and genetically distinctive subtypes of fibrosarcoma and (iii) increased understanding of the many other mesenchymal and non-mesenchymal tumours that may mimic fibrosarcoma. This review article will summarize the current state of our knowledge about strictly defined adult fibrosarcoma and discuss important entities in its differential diagnosis, including various fibrosarcoma variants, monophasic synovial sarcoma and other potential mesenchymal and non-mesenchymal mimics.

### Radiation-induced fibrosarcoma after radiotherapy for osteosarcoma in the mandibular condyle [^114kUDsH]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

With recent improvements in survival duration after cancer treatment, it is becoming increasingly important to study treatment-related morbidity and mortality. Radiation-induced sarcomas in the irradiated field are well-known potential late sequelae of radiotherapy. These tumors are biologically aggressive. In the case described here, a radiation-induced fibrosarcoma appeared at 20 years after initial surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy for an osteosarcoma of the mandibular condyle. Radiation-induced fibrosarcoma is relatively rare in the head and neck region. The details of this case are presented, and diagnostic and management considerations are described.

### Diagnosis and management of tropomyosin receptor kinase (TRK) fusion sarcomas: expert recommendations from the world sarcoma network [^115xTTv8]. Annals of Oncology (2020). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL MANAGEMENT OF TRK FUSION SARCOMAS

The labeled indications for larotrectinib (FDA and EMA) and entrectinib (FDA) include patients for whom surgery is likely to result in severe morbidity or who have no satisfactory alternative therapy. Therefore, the advantages and disadvantages of TRK inhibitors compared with other available therapies should be discussed by the patient and the treating physician.

In addition to the overall efficacy of TRK inhibitors described earlier (Table 2), efficacy of neoadjuvant larotrectinib therapy has also been demonstrated in situations where surgery would otherwise result in life-changing operations (e.g. amputation). Five children with locally advanced TRK fusion sarcomas (three with infantile fibrosarcomas and two with other soft tissue sarcomas) achieved a partial response to neoadjuvant larotrectinib and underwent resection after a median of six treatment cycles. Resections were R0 (negative resection margins with no tumor at the inked resection margin) in three patients, R1 (microscopic residual tumor at the resection margin) in one patient and R2 (incomplete resection with macroscopic residual tumor) in one patient. Three patients achieved complete or near-complete pathological responses and at last follow-up remained disease-free 7–15 months after surgery. While these data are encouraging, the question of if and when to discontinue TRK inhibitor therapy following a complete response still remains.

### Secondary fibrosarcoma of the brain stem treated with cyclophosphamide and imatinib [^1144dycw]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

Secondary fibrosarcoma of the brain is an exceedingly rare tumor, occurring almost exclusively as a complication of therapeutic radiation to a preexisting intracranial tumor. Fibrosarcomas are aggressive tumors, with poor prognosis. These tumors tend to spread rapidly with extensive involvement of the optic nerves, hypothalamus, and the brain stem, which makes total surgical resection impossible. No clinical trial for brain fibrosarcoma has been conducted to date, and current treatment options based on case reports encompass subtotal resection attempts, Glia-Site brachytherapy system, or chemotherapy.

We report a case of a 48 year old man who presented with a brainstem lesion 20 years after he received radiation therapy for a pituitary tumor. Upon further investigation, the new tumor was diagnosed as fibrosarcoma secondary to radiation therapy. A subtotal resection of the tumor was performed followed by chemotherapy. We chose to treat the patient with cyclophosphamide and Gleevec chemotherapy and to follow him with serial imaging, which showed evidence of tumor stability for 6 months.

### Larotrectinib for newly diagnosed infantile fibrosarcoma and other pediatricFusion-positive solid tumors (children's oncology group ADVL1823) [^112Ux13g]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The TRK inhibitor larotrectinib is US Food and Drug Administration approved for NTRK fusion-positive solid tumors that lack a satisfactory alternative or have progressed after treatment but has not been systematically studied as a frontline therapy with a defined duration of treatment. ADVL1823 evaluated larotrectinib in patients with newly diagnosed NTRK fusion-positive solid tumors with response-adapted duration of therapy and local control.

Methods

Patients received larotrectinib twice daily in 28-day cycles for a predefined duration of treatment, ranging from 6 to 26 cycles depending on response to therapy and surgical resectability. The primary end point was the objective response rate (ORR) within six cycles in patients with infantile fibrosarcoma (IFS); patients with other histologic diagnoses were analyzed in a separate cohort. Secondary objectives included event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS).

Results

Thirty-three patients were enrolled: 18 with IFS and 15 with other solid tumors. The ORR within six cycles was 94% (17/18; 95% adjusted CI, 72.7 to 98.6) among children with IFS and 60% (9/15; 95% CI, 32.3 to 83.7) among children with other solid tumors. Six percent (2/33; 95% CI, 0.7 to 22.2) patients developed progressive disease while on therapy. Two-year EFS and OS among these groups were 82.2% (95% CI, 54.3 to 93.9) and 93.8% (95% CI, 63.2 to 99.1) for IFS and 80% (95% CI, 50.0 to 93.1) and 93.3% (95% CI, 61.3 to 99.0) for other solid tumors, respectively. Patients undergoing surgical resection of their tumor had prolonged EFS, with only 1 of 16 such patients experiencing disease progression. Four of 33 patients had dose-limiting toxicities.

Conclusion

Larotrectinib is highly active in patients with newly diagnosed NTRK fusion-positive solid tumors. Larotrectinib should be a frontline option for patients with IFS and other NTRK fusion-positive solid tumors. Local control with surgical resection remains important in the treatment of patients with IFS.

### The impact of local control in the treatment of children with advanced infantile and adult-type fibrosarcoma: experience of the cooperative weichteilsarkom studiengruppe (CWS) [^113SWrtb]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

This study aims at examining the potential survival benefits of primary versus secondary surgery of children diagnosed with advanced infantile (iFS) and adult-type fibrosarcoma (aFS).

Methods

Treatment and outcome of 89 children with FS treated within prospective Cooperative Studiengruppe (CWS) trials (1981–2016) were analyzed retrospectively.

Results

Localized disease (LD) was diagnosed in 87 patients: 64/66 patients with iFS (≤ 2 years) and 23 with aFS (> 2 ≤ 18 years). Two patients (iFS) had metastatic disease. Resection was the mainstay of therapy of patients with LD resulting in microscopically complete (R0, IRS group I) (n = 29/87, 33%), microscopically incomplete (R1, IRS group II) (n = 17/87, 20%) and macroscopically incomplete (R2, IRS group III) (n = 41/87, 47%). Advanced LD (IRS group III) was present in 32/64 (50%) patients with iFS and in 9/23 (39%) with aFS. Chemotherapy was added predominantly in patients with advanced disease and an assessable objective response to CHT was seen in 71% iFS and 75% aFS. The 5-year event-free survival (EFS) of patients with iFS and aFS was 81% (± 10, 95% CI) and 70% (± 19, 95% CI) (p = 0.24); the 5-year overall survival (OS) was 98% (± 3, 95% CI) and 82% (± 16, 95% CI) (p = 0.02). Primary resection was no prognostic factor. Secondary R0/ R1 resection in patients with advanced disease improved 5-year EFS and OS in aFS (p = 0.002 and p = 0.000) but not in infants.

Conclusions

Secondary resection improves outcome in advanced aFS but not in infants. Mutilating surgery in infants should be avoided.

Mini-Abstract

Fibrosarcoma is a very rare malignant tumor. Little is known about differences of local treatment of advanced infantile and adult-type. Data of 89 patients registered in five prospective trials and one registry of the Cooperative Weichteilsarkom Studiengruppe (CWS) (1981–2016) were analyzed.

Extremity/body wall and head/neck soft tissue sarcoma footnotes — these guidelines are intended to treat the adult population, and "All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated". Imaging guidance states "Imaging studies should include cross-sectional imaging (MRI with and without contrast and/or CT with contrast)" and "Other imaging studies such as angiogram and plain x-ray may be warranted in selected circumstances". It notes that "Different subtypes have different propensities to spread to various locations". For neurofibromatosis, "Patients with neurofibromatosis are at risk for multiple sarcomas at various locations and their assessment and follow-up should be different", and to "Consider FDG-PET/CT as part of initial workup to differentiate between neurofibroma(s) and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST)". For DFSP with fibrosarcomatous change, "Patients with DFSP with fibrosarcomatous changes and/or malignant transformations should be treated according to the algorithms for other soft tissue sarcomas of the extremity/body wall and head/neck (EXTSARC-1 and SARC-G, 4 of 14)".

### New strategies in sarcoma therapy: linking biology and novel agents [^113JSPPA]. Clinical Cancer Research (2012). Low credibility.

The ability to better interrogate the genetic state of a given cancer is giving rise to a new paradigm in cancer therapeutics in which the specific genetic alterations that give rise to the cancer inform the therapeutic decision-making for that specific patient. Sarcomas of soft tissue and bone represent model diseases that underscore this paradigm. However, many barriers prevent linkage of one of the 75 or more different types of sarcoma to novel therapeutic agents. In the present perspective, the authors outline key therapeutic opportunities and hurdles in clinical sarcoma research, focusing on specific examples of sarcomas that are on the verge of new breakthroughs, as well as those in which promise has not lived up to expectations. Focused clinical trial design, ideally with several biomarker or histology-specific arms, is one means to be simultaneously parsimonious and inclusive.

### Prognosis of fibrosarcoma in patients with and without a history of radiation for nasopharyngeal carcinoma [^111oEU3y]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose

To determine whether radiation-induced fibrosarcoma (RIF) in patients with a history of radiotherapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) was associated with an inferior prognosis compared to sporadic fibrosarcoma of the head and neck.

Methods

Forty-two patients with RIF who previously received radiotherapy for NPC and 124 patients with sporadic fibrosarcoma of the head and neck were identified between January 1965 and December 2013 at our institution. Information on clinicopathologic characteristics and treatment was abstracted from medical records. The primary end point was disease-specific survival (DSS).

Results

The median latency from NPC diagnosis to RIF diagnosis was 9.9 years (range 3.1–36.8 years). RIF was diagnosed at an older age than sporadic fibrosarcoma. Treatment modality was significantly different between the two groups, with only 64.3% of the RIF group receiving surgery ± adjuvant treatment versus 91.1% in the sporadic fibrosarcoma group (P < 0.001). Patients with RIF had poorer 5-year DSS compared to the sporadic fibrosarcoma group (36.2 vs. 50.4%; P = 0.026). Multivariate analysis of the combined group indicated that patient group (P = 0.032), tumor, node, metastasis classification system stage (P = 0.019), histologic grade (P = 0.046) and treatment modality (P < 0.001) were independent variables affecting DSS.

Conclusions

Compared to patients with sporadic fibrosarcoma, NPC survivors who develop RIF are older at diagnosis of fibrosarcoma and have an inferior prognosis.

### A combined modality approach to recurrent cardiac sarcoma resulting in a prolonged remission: a case report [^1177g8z8]. Chest (2003). Low credibility.

We report a case of cardiac fibrosarcoma that was treated with cardiac tumor resection, chemotherapy, cardiac explantation, tumor repeat resection, and autotransplantation followed by external beam irradiation. The patient was able to achieve clinical remission and remained disease free > 2 years after the initial diagnosis. This case report demonstrates that a sustained remission from cardiac sarcoma is possible with an aggressive combined modality approach.

We believe this case represents the first confirmed congenital infantile fibrosarcoma (CIFS) of the heart. We describe an infant with congenital infantile fibrosarcoma of the heart who was treated with chemotherapy and who had a life-threatening complication develop that was successfully corrected by surgery. This demonstrates an unusual presentation, remarkable imaging, and diagnostic and treatment dilemmas. More significantly, this emphasizes the importance of a multidisciplinary approach for successful treatment of congenital infantile fibrosarcoma.

### Clinical characteristics and surgical features of intracranial fibrosarcoma [^117Tf9NK]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Intracranial fibrosarcoma is an extremely rare neoplasm in the central nervous system. Insofar there were only sporadic case reports describing its features. The purpose of this study is to review the clinical and surgical features of cases who were treated in our department.

Method

The authors retrospectively reviewed and detailed the clinical and surgical data obtained from 5 patients with fibrosarcoma who underwent treatment at our institute between January 2009 and January 2019.

Results

There were 3 males and 2 females including 2 juvenile and 3 senior patients. The most frequent sign was intermittent pain and vomiting. The location of the tumor included middle fossa, thalamus and midbrain, sellar and suprasellar region and right parietal-occipital lobe. Surgical observation demonstrated the consistency of the tumor was tenacious with abundant blood supply. Gross total resection was achieved in 2 cases. Pathological analysis showed spindle cells in a herringbone form with positive Vimentin staining in all 5 cases, with the absence of GFAP or S-100. All 5 patients were deceased eventually after a varied period of time after the first surgery.

Conclusion

Intracranial fibrosarcoma was a highly malignant entity presented in the central nervous system. Surgery still remains the first-line treatment followed by radiotherapy, however, the prognostic outcome was very poor. Future studies should be more focused on accumulation of the relevant information on this disease thus hopefully in assisting to developing more optimized treatment.

### Systemic treatment in advanced soft tissue sarcoma: what is standard, what is new [^113u16W4]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Soft tissue sarcomas (STS) are a heterogeneous group of rare neoplasms with mesenchymal origin, encompassing approximately 70 different entities. The natural history of these aggressive diseases is characterised by a strong tendency toward local recurrence and metastatic spreading, which occur in 10–30% and 30–40% of patients, respectively, despite optimal initial strategies. The lung is the most common site of STS metastases and pulmonary metastasectomy is the standard treatment for selected patients with limited lung disease. For metastatic patients not eligible for surgery, chemotherapy still plays the most relevant role in the management of the disease. Despite advances over the last decades, the outcome for metastatic patients remains poor, with a median reported overall survival (OS) of 14–17 months. In this review, we aim to summarise the results from the most recent studies on metastatic STS and provide indications on the treatment of this rare condition.

### Preoperative treatment with pazopanib in a case of chemotherapy-resistant infantile fibrosarcoma [^1124vreR]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2016). Low credibility.

Clinical and radiological diagnosis of infantile fibrosarcoma (IFS) is challenging because of its similarity to vascular origin tumors. Treatment involves complete resection. Although chemotherapy may allow more conservative resection, treatment guidelines are not strictly defined. One IFS patient with an unresectable tumor had disease progression during chemotherapy. A primary tumor sample showed high VEGFR-1/2/3 and PDGFR-α/β expression. After pazopanib therapy, most tumor showed necrosis within 29 days and could be removed completely, with no relapse in 8 months post-resection. When IFS features hypervascularity, VEGFR and PDGFR expression may be high, thus allowing consideration of VEGFR inhibitors such as pazopanib.

### Aggressive fibromatosis of the parapharyngeal space: two cases and treatment recommendations [^112J4KUt]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2004). Low credibility.

Aggressive fibromatosis is an uncommon tumor that is locally aggressive but not malignant. Therefore, its classification falls between the benign and malignant neoplasms of soft-tissue origin. In the past, these lesions were misdiagnosed as low-grade fibrosarcomas. Otolaryngologists should be familiar with these lesions because as many as 15% of them occur in the head and neck. The treatment of choice is wide surgical excision, which is often difficult. Postexcision recurrence rates are high. Nonsurgical treatment includes radiation and chemotherapy, both of which are usually reserved for recurrences. We describe two cases of aggressive fibromatosis of the parapharyngeal space, and we review the available treatment options.

### Pivotal role of innate and adaptive immunity in anthracycline chemotherapy of established tumors [^112auakT]. Cancer Research (2011). Low credibility.

We show, in a series of established experimental breast adenocarcinomas and fibrosarcomas induced by carcinogen de novo in mice, that the therapeutic efficacy of doxorubicin treatment is dependent on CD8 T cells and IFN-γ production. Doxorubicin treatment enhances tumor antigen-specific proliferation of CD8 T cells in tumor-draining lymph nodes and promotes tumor infiltration of activated, IFN-γ-producing CD8 T cells. Optimal doxorubicin treatment outcome also requires both interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-17 cytokines, as blockade of IL-1β/IL-1R or IL-17A/IL-17Rα signaling abrogated the therapeutic effect. IL-23p19 had no observed role. The presence of γδ T cells, but not Jα18(+) natural killer T cells, at the time of doxorubicin treatment was also important. In tumor samples taken from breast cancer patients prior to treatment with anthracycline chemotherapy, a correlation between CD8α, CD8β, and IFN-γ gene expression levels and clinical response was observed, supporting their role in the therapeutic efficacy of anthracyclines in humans. Overall, these data strongly support the pivotal contribution of both innate and adaptive immunity in treatment outcomes of anthracycline chemotherapy.

ASTRO quality of evidence (QoE) grades characterize study types and evidence interpretation: High: 2 or more well-conducted and highly generalizable randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or meta-analyses of such trials; evidence interpretation: the true effect is very likely to lie close to the estimate of the effect based on the body of evidence. Moderate: 1 well-conducted and highly generalizable RCT or a meta-analysis of such trials OR 2 or more RCTs with some weaknesses of procedure or generalizability OR 2 or more strong observational studies with consistent findings; evidence interpretation: the true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect based on the body of evidence, but it is possible that it is substantially different. Low: 1 RCT with some weaknesses of procedure or generalizability OR 1 or more RCTs with serious deficiencies of procedure or generalizability or extremely small sample sizes OR 2 or more observational studies with inconsistent findings, small sample sizes, or other problems that potentially confound interpretation of data; evidence interpretation: the true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect and there is a risk that future research may significantly alter the estimate of the effect size or the interpretation of the results. Expert Opinion: consensus of the panel based on clinical judgment and experience, due to absence of evidence or limitations in evidence; evidence interpretation: strong consensus (≥ 90%) of the panel guides the recommendation despite insufficient evidence to discern the true magnitude and direction of the net effect. Further research may better inform the topic.

### UK guidelines for the management of soft tissue sarcomas [^111JKWZC]. British Journal of Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Rationale and objective of guidelines

Soft tissue sarcomas (STS) are a relatively uncommon group of malignancies. On average a general practitioner may only see one sarcoma in their career. To improve diagnosis and treatment of these tumours, management was rationalised to peer-reviewed regional soft-tissue sarcoma services. An outline of best practice was set out in the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence Improving Outcomes Guidance for people with sarcoma published in 2006 and subsequent quality standards for benchmarking published in 2015.

These guidelines review current evidence concerning management of soft-tissue sarcoma and provide recommendations to support best practice. They are not intended to be prescriptive but aim to improve the quality of care for patients with STS by helping identify and inform the key decisions involved in their management. They will hopefully provide a useful resource for sarcoma services to help guide multidisciplinary team (MDT) case discussions, and patient management.

Methods

This updated guideline has been authored and reviewed by specialists from the British Sarcoma Group involved in diagnosing and treating patients with sarcoma. As with previous versions, the current NICE (National Institute for Clinical Excellence), ESMO (European Society for Medical Oncology) and NCCN (National Comprehensive Cancer Network) guidance documents have been reviewed, tailoring the recommendations for UK practice. It provides a summary of the current state of established knowledge in sarcoma diagnosis and management, with guidance on what is considered current best practice in the UK. It has been derived by a consensus of expert opinion based on their interpretation of currently available data, and their own clinical experience. Levels of evidence and grades of recommendation (Table 1) have been provided (where appropriate) for all of the key recommendations.

Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP) special considerations and technique notes: If areas of transformation to fibrosarcoma or other sarcoma subtypes are identified, multidisciplinary consultation for consideration of further treatment and surveillance is recommended, and FS-DFSP is associated with a higher metastasis risk; the patient should be referred to a center with expertise in management of soft tissue sarcomas. The most commonly used form of PDEMA is Mohs, and when anatomic structures at the deep margin preclude complete histologic evaluation, Mohs or other forms of PDEMA should be used to evaluate as much of the marginal surface as feasible. If PDEMA is unavailable, consider wide excision and wide undermining is discouraged prior to confirmation of clear margins. Consider neoadjuvant Imatinib for patients in whom resection with negative margins may result in unacceptable functional or cosmetic outcomes, and see Principles of Radiation Therapy (DFSP-C).

### A newborn with a large NTRK fusion positive infantile fibrosarcoma successfully treated with larotrectinib [^111TVuZ2]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2020). Medium credibility.

Infantile fibrosarcoma (IFS) is a rare pediatric cancer that typically presents early in life. Surgical resection is commonly curative; however, resection is sometimes not possible requiring additional multimodal treatment. IFS commonly harbors a fusion in one of the neurotrophic receptor tyrosine kinase (NTRK) genes. Larotrectinib, a highly selective inhibitor of tropomyosin receptor kinase (TRK), has been shown to be well tolerated and effective in children as young as 1-month old. We report a case of IFS in a newborn treated with larotrectinib. The patient experienced a rapid clinical and radiographic response demonstrating the potential to treat newborns with larotrectinib.

### Infantile fibrosarcoma with NTRK3-ETV6 fusion successfully treated with the tropomyosin-related kinase inhibitor LOXO-101 [^111zrYfi]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2016). Low credibility.

The radiologic tumor regression and clinical response seen in this patient with an ETV6–NTRK3 fusion positive IFS provide further clinical validation not only of this molecular target in oncology but also for NTRK fusions as drivers of clinical disease. This case report supports the clinical development of selective TRK inhibitors such as LOXO‐101 in pediatric patients with an NTRK fusion. This case report underscores the potential promise of targeted therapies in pediatric populations when compelling oncogenic drivers can be identified and potent investigational inhibitors are available. Their role in the neoadjuvant, adjuvant, and metastatic settings as well as safety in inhibiting TRK in infants deserves further clinical investigation.

### Congenital infantile fibrosarcoma in a very low-birth-weight infant [^115Zckm2]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

We describe a prenatally diagnosed case with congenital infantile fibrosarcoma, which is a rare malignant tumor, of which there have been only 14 cases reported in the English literature. A giant mass on the left thigh was detected at 24 weeks' gestation by prenatal ultrasonography. Because of its rapid growth and nonreassuring fetal status in utero, the baby was delivered by cesarean delivery at 27 weeks' gestation. The case was complicated by hemorrhagic anemia, coagulopathy, and cardiac failure, and a tumor resection was performed on day 3. As of age 2.5 years, he was healthy without evidence of recurrence. Because some fetal cases with congenital infantile fibrosarcoma have a poor prognosis, termination of pregnancy at an appropriate time and postnatal early treatment are crucial for successful treatment.

### Safety and feasibility of anlotinib in children with high risk, recurrent or refractory sarcomas: an open-label, single-centre, single-arm, phase Ia / Ib trial [^113uHmRy]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

In terms of safety, anlotinib displayed an overall favourable safety profile in paediatric patients. The most commonly observed non-hematological toxicities were hypothyroidism, abdominal pain, and diarrhoea. These findings are consistent with previous studies on anlotinib and provide further evidence of the drug's manageable safety profile in this patient population. Importantly, no Grade 4 toxicities were reported during the study, underscoring the tolerability of anlotinib.

The effectiveness of anlotinib in paediatric patients with sarcoma has been impacted by prior exposure to multiple lines of chemotherapy. The administration of various chemotherapeutic agents before enrolment in our study might have induced resistance mechanisms or exhausted treatment options for these patients. Moreover, the complexity and heterogeneity of pathological subtypes of sarcomas may lead to varied responses to anlotinib. Anlotinib showed antitumour activity in several histologic types of STS, such as fibrosarcoma, alveolar soft-part sarcoma, liposarcoma, and synovial sarcoma. In this study, only one patient with fibrosarcoma was included, and the efficacy evaluation result was SD, with a tumour increase of 14.8%. Due to significant differences in the common pathological subtypes of sarcomas between adults and children, this study has not yet included other pathological types suggested in adult studies that might respond effectively to anlotinib. It is worth noting that the small sample size is not sufficient for a comprehensive evaluation of the efficacy of anlotinib. While the observed DCR of 52.4% suggests preliminary activity of the treatment, the small efficacy cohort (n = 21) limits the generalizability of conclusions. A multicentre real-world study suggests the efficacy of pazopanib in paediatric sarcoma. Nineteen patients were eligible for efficacy analysis and no objective response was observed, but 10 patients (52.6%) achieved stable disease. The median PFS and OS were 3.0 months and 6.2 months, respectively. Although the results of efficacy are similar to those of anlotinib, anlotinib achieved a longer OS in our study. It is necessary to increase the sample size to further explore the efficacy of anlotinib in this population and future studies should prioritize predefined subgroup analyses to confirm these signals, particularly in histology-driven populations.

### Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase signaling promotes growth and vascularization of fibrosarcoma [^1163psxw]. Molecular Cancer Therapeutics (2008). Low credibility.

We hypothesized that signaling through multiple mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase (MKK) pathways is essential for the growth and vascularization of soft-tissue sarcomas, which are malignant tumors derived from mesenchymal tissues. We tested this using HT-1080, NCI, and Shac fibrosarcoma-derived cell lines and anthrax lethal toxin (LeTx), a bacterial toxin that inactivates MKKs. Western blots confirmed that LeTx treatment reduced the levels of phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase and p38 MAPK in vitro. Although short treatments with LeTx only modestly affected cell proliferation, sustained treatment markedly reduced cell numbers. LeTx also substantially inhibited the extracellular release of angioproliferative factors including vascular endothelial growth factor, interleukin-8, and basic fibroblast growth factor. Similar results were obtained with cell lines derived from malignant fibrous histiocytomas, leiomyosarcomas, and liposarcomas. In vivo, LeTx decreased MAPK activity and blocked fibrosarcoma growth. Growth inhibition correlated with decreased cellular proliferation and extensive necrosis, and it was accompanied by a decrease in tumor mean vessel density as well as a reduction in serum expression of angioproliferative cytokines. Vital imaging using high-resolution ultrasound enhanced with contrast microbubbles revealed that the effects of LeTx on tumor perfusion were remarkably rapid (< 24 h) and resulted in a marked reduction of perfusion within the tumor but not in nontumor tissues. These results are consistent with our initial hypothesis and lead us to propose that MKK inhibition by LeTx is a broadly effective strategy for targeting neovascularization in fibrosarcomas and other similar proliferative lesions.

### Aggressive fibromatosis [^112kV6im]. American Journal of Clinical Oncology (2005). Low credibility.

The purpose of this article is to review the pertinent literature and to define the optimal treatment of patients with aggressive fibromatosis. Data indicate the likelihood of local recurrence after surgery is high, particularly if margins are positive. Moderate-dose radiotherapy alone for gross disease or after a microscopically incomplete resection yields local control rates of approximately 75% to 80%. Treatment with pharmacologic agents results in objective response rates of approximately 40% to 50%; duration of response is variable. Thus, the optimal management for aggressive fibromatosis depends on tumor location and extent. Surgery is indicated if the lesion appears to be completely resectable with acceptable function and cosmesis. Radiotherapy is indicated for patients with unresectable tumors; those with positive margins after resection should be considered for adjuvant radiotherapy depending on the location and extent of the tumor. Pharmacologic treatment should be considered for patients with progressive disease after unsuccessful local-regional therapy.

### Infantile fibrosarcoma of the perineum with dorsal metastasis in a neonate: a case report original [^116LZoQj]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Infantile fibrosarcoma is a rare pediatric soft tissue tumor and usually appears in children before one year of age. Distal extremities constitute the most frequently affected locations, and other tissues such as the trunk, head and neck, gut, sacrococcygeal region, and viscera are uncommon sites.

Case presentation

We describe a rare case of infantile fibrosarcoma arising from the perineum. First, a cystic mass was detected using prenatal ultrasonography, and then an echo was changed in serial ultrasound examinations. A solid cystic lesion was found at term; a hypoechoic lesion occurred in the back. The tumor became so large that massive bleeding occurred, which then underwent surgical resection. Pathological examination confirmed infantile fibrosarcoma.

Conclusion

Our report demonstrates not all ultrasonographic findings in cases of infantile fibrosarcoma exhibit a solid mass during the initial examination — an early-stage lesion may reveal a cystic echo. Infantile fibrosarcoma has a good prognosis and surgery constitute the main treatment, with adjuvant chemotherapy being received if necessary.

### Growth rate and outcomes in locally recurrent extremity and truncal soft tissue sarcoma [^116vtThK]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

A prior study from our institution, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York, New York, identified short DFI, large LR tumor size, and histological grade to be associated with worse disease-specific survival in patients with LR of an extremity or soft tissue sarcoma, although neither the effect on second LR nor the impact of histological subtype was examined. Prior studies have also examined the prognostic utility of the treatment-naïve growth rate of primary soft tissue sarcomas, and 18 F-fludeoxyglucose peak uptakeand rate of uptakeon positron emission tomography of primary and recurrent soft tissue sarcomas. Future work with larger multi-institutional datasets could investigate comprehensive models, including both LR growth rate and these other imaging variables.

Interestingly, we did not find that histological subtype was associated with DSD or second LR in the locally recurrent setting when stratified by DSD risk after primary tumor resection. One hypothesis is that the presence of LR selects for more aggressive subsets of low-risk histological subtypes. Furthermore, the exclusion of patients with prior or synchronous distant recurrences also removes the most aggressive subsets of high-risk histological subtypes. Thus, the clinical behavior in this specific patient cohort may be more uniform across histological subtypes, although histological grade remained independently associated with DSD in the locally recurrent setting. Within histological risk subgroups, an exploratory analysis identified that the average LR growth rate remained associated with incidence of DSD, except for the low-risk subgroup, which may not have had an adequate sample size to detect a small difference. Average LR growth rate was also highest in the high-risk subgroup, which appeared to be associated with differences in DFI across histological risk groups as opposed to tumor size.

Limitations

Our study has several limitations. First, this was a retrospective single-institution study and is thus subject to selection bias and unmeasured confounders. Since the database we used dates back to 1982, some histological examination findings, such as fibrosarcoma have since been reclassified, and older cases do not have pathology slides readily available for re-review. Patients who experienced a LR but received treatment elsewhere may have been missed in our cohort. Some subgroups, such as patients with truncal tumors or patients who underwent R2 resection for LR, were too small in our cohort to assess for association with our primary outcomes on their own. Local recurrence growth rate also cannot be applied to tumors for which a size cannot be precisely obtained, such as angiosarcomas. Finally, we also need to validate our findings in an external dataset to confirm applicability to a broader patient population.

FIGURE 1
Fibrosarcoma infiltrates the segmental airway of the right lower lobe. Arrow shows the tumor infiltrating the segmental airways of the right lower lobe bronchus.

Eventually the patient underwent successful pneumonectomy with médiastinal lymphadenectomy. The pneumonectomy specimen confirmed the 2 separate origins of the tumor (Fig. 2).

FIGURE 2
Pneumonectomy specimen shows the infiltration of the segmental airway of the RLLB. Arrow shows the macroscopic infiltration of the RLLB. RLLB indicates right lower lobe bronchus.

The juvenile bronchopulmonary fibrosarcoma is a rare tumor of the airways with < 100 cases reported. This case is of interest as the tumors developed asynchronously at 2 separate locations. The site of origin could have been either the endobronchial tree or the lung parenchymal. This rare malignant tumor occurs in the large airways of younger individuals but tends to localize in the parenchyma in older individuals. Endobronchial fibrosarcoma has been shown to have a better diagnosis than inraparenchymal fibrosarcoma.

We used rigid bronchoscopy accompanied by high-frequency electrocautery to resect the tumors. The combination of rigid bronchoscopy and electrocautery or laser is useful in establishing airway patency from the lesion. Kunst and colleagues have used rigid bronchoscopy with electrocautery to completely remove a tumor from the right mainstem bronchus that originated from the right upper lobe carina. The patient had no recurrence or metastasis and remained free of the disease for over 5 years.

Surgery remains a mainstay treatment for fibrosarcoma. In our case, although we achieved a complete endobronchial resection of the tumor with rigid bronchoscopy and electrocautery, the appearance of tumor at a second location led us to use surgery as a curative option. Mitotic index is useful in deciding for surgical treatment and is of prognostic significance. Besides, it has been showed that tumors with 8 mitotic figures per 10 high-power fields behave aggressively. Our patient had a much higher mitotic index which also helped us choose the appropriate treatment modality. Our patient continues to do well without any evidence of recurrence.

### Systemic treatment in advanced soft tissue sarcoma: what is standard, what is new [^112Y46Ym]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Doxorubicin remains to date the standard in the treatment of advanced STS. The combination with ifosfamide should be considered upfront in fit patients who might benefit from tumour response and in histologies with selective sensitivity to alkylating agents. Despite encouraging preliminary data, results from the recently completed phase 3 study on olaratumab and doxorubicin are required to confirm the value of this combination in first-line treatment. Beyond the first line, the treatment for STS is being increasingly driven by histology. Newer strategies, including drugs targeting epigenetic mechanisms and immunotherapies, are currently being developed to improve the outcome in this population.

### Long-term results of intrathoracic chemohyperthermia (ITCH) for the treatment of pleural malignancies [^1161UeF7]. British Journal of Cancer (2003). Low credibility.

There is no standard treatment for patients with pleural malignancies. The aim of this prospective study was to investigate the toxicity and long-term results of a multimodality treatment consisting of surgery and intrathoracic chemohyperthermia (ITCH) for the treatment of patients with pleural malignancies. From January 1990 to August 2000, 24 patients with mesothelioma (n = 17), fibrosarcoma (n = 3), pleural adenocarcinoma (n = 3) and thymoma (n = 1) were included. The mesothelioma stages were T1 or T2 in 10 cases, and T3 or T4 in seven cases. After cytoreductive surgery, ITCH was carried out for over 60 min, at inflow temperatures less than 45 degrees C, either with mitomycin C (n = 7) or cisplatin (n = 5) or both (n = 12). One patient died from major thoracic air leaks after major decortication and pleurectomy. Seven patients had complications, one pleural clotting necessitating reoperation. After a median follow-up of 89 months, the overall 1-year and 5-year survival rates were 74 and 27%, respectively. For T1 and T2 mesothelioma patients, the median survival was 41.3 months, and for T3 and T4 tumours, it was 4.5 months (P = 0.001). The fibrosarcoma patients are alive with no evidence of recurrence at 24, 43 and 54 months. In the conclusion, the combination of surgery with ITCH with mitomycin and/or cisplatin is relatively safe. This procedure may offer unexpected long-term survival in a selected group of patients (T1 and T2 mesothelioma patients and fibrosarcoma patients).

Unresectable or metastatic disease occurs in 40% to 60% of soft-tissue sarcoma (STS) patients and portends a poor prognosis. For decades, doxorubicin has formed the backbone of systemic treatment, with response rates of approximately 26%. Patients progressing following first-line therapy were left with few proven options. No other cytotoxic chemotherapy agent or combination has demonstrated superiority to doxorubicin. Advances in targeted therapy of STS have been hindered by STS heterogeneity and poorly understood disease biology. Despite challenges, progress has been made in specific STS subtypes. Here, we highlight the challenges, progress, and lessons learned from STS trials published in the last 20 to 25 years.

### Fibroblastic and myofibroblastic soft-tissue tumors: imaging spectrum and radiologic-pathologic correlation [^115UMWv6]. Radiographics (2023). Medium credibility.

Fibroblastic and myofibroblastic tumors are a variable group of neoplasms ranging from benign to malignant. These lesions may affect patients of any age group but are more frequently encountered in the pediatric population. Patient clinical presentation depends on the location, growth pattern, adjacent soft-tissue involvement, and pathologic behavior of these neoplasms. In the 2020 update to the World Health Organization (WHO) classification system, these tumors are classified on the basis of their distinct biologic behavior, histomorphologic characteristics, and molecular profiles into four tumor categories: (a) benign (eg, fibrous hamartoma of infancy, nodular fasciitis, proliferative fasciitis, fibroma of the tendon sheath, calcifying aponeurotic fibroma); (b) intermediate, locally aggressive (eg, desmoid fibromatosis); (c) intermediate, rarely metastasizing (eg, dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans, myxoinflammatory fibroblastic sarcoma, low-grade myofibroblastic sarcoma, infantile fibrosarcoma); and (d) malignant (eg, sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcomas; low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma; myxofibrosarcoma; fibrosarcoma, not otherwise specified). Detection of various components of solid tumors at imaging can help in prediction of the presence of corresponding histopathologic variations, thus influencing diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment planning. For example, lesions with a greater myxoid matrix or necrotic components tend to show higher signal intensity on T2-weighted MR images, whereas lesions with hypercellularity and dense internal collagen content display low signal intensity. In addition, understanding the radiologic-pathologic correlation of soft-tissue tumors can help to increase the accuracy of percutaneous biopsy and allow unnecessary interventions to be avoided. © RSNA, 2023 Quiz questions for this article are available in the supplemental material.

### Secondary fibrosarcoma of the brain stem treated with cyclophosphamide and imatinib [^113ZXT6z]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2010). Low credibility.

Case report

Clinical course

A 48-year old Caucasian man presented to clinic for evaluation of his options for the treatment of brainstem fibrosarcoma. In 1977, 26 years prior to this presentation, the patient was diagnosed with a large pituitary adenoma based on a head computer tomography. Biopsy was not performed at the time. However, he received conformal fractionated radiotherapy of unknown dose. He also had concurrent hydrocephalus and a ventriculo–peritoneal shunt was placed. The patient was asymptomatic until 2003 when he started to develop eye left eyelid drooping and diplopia. A magnetic resonance study performed in February of 2004 showed a right brainstem lesion. Stereotactic needle brain biopsy was performed but the results were inconclusive. The patient was followed with serial neuroimaging until August of 2006 when the tumor experienced significant growth associated with progressive neurologic impairment. At that time a second stereotactic biopsy was performed, which also failed to show the pathology of the tumor. In May of 2007, the patient underwent subtotal resection of his large right pontine enhancing mass. Pathology results revealed that the tissue was most consisted with grade 2 fibrosarcoma. Post operatively the patient suffered a pseudomeningocele at the incision site, which required a VP shunt revision. Subsequently he presented to our clinic for reevaluation of this therapeutic options. After careful consideration of the different options available we decided to use a combination of metronomic cyclophosphamide at 50 mg a day and Imatinib 400 mg a day. The choice of Imatinib was based on the newest published data on the soft-tissue sarcoma and gastrointestinal stromal tumors sensitivity to Imatinib and the recent clinical trials showing that this chemotherapy agent is a potential option for primary malignant gliomas. Cyclophosphamide is very commonly used in the treatment of multiple CNS malignancies such as malignant glioma and meningioma, and also shows good activity in the treatment of systemic fibrosarcoma which motivates our decision to include this drug in this patient's regimen.

### The T-box transcription factor 3 is a promising biomarker and a key regulator of the oncogenic phenotype of a diverse range of sarcoma subtypes [^112EvbjM]. Oncogenesis (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

There is a significant body of evidence implicating TBX3 as an oncoprotein in several carcinomas; however, nothing is known about its status and role in sarcomas. Here we show that TBX3 is highly expressed in a panel of soft tissue and bone sarcoma cell lines and patient-derived sarcoma tissue. Significantly, chondrosarcoma and fibrosarcoma cell culture models in which TBX3 was either depleted or overexpressed revealed that while TBX3 contributes to cell proliferation, migration and tumour formation in chondrosarcoma cells, it has an inhibitory effect on these processes in fibrosarcomas. A positive effect of TBX3 on cell migration was also observed in liposarcoma and rhabdomyosarcoma cells. Together these findings provide evidence that the overexpression of TBX3 may be a feature of a wide range of sarcoma subtypes and that TBX3 impacts directly on their development as either an oncogene or a tumour suppressor.

Sarcomas represent a diverse cluster of malignancies with vastly different biology and clinical behaviour and this presents a serious obstacle to early and reliable diagnosis as well as therapy. In addition, many sarcoma subtypes are associated with poor prognosis due to resistance to conventional therapies such as surgery, chemotherapy and radiation, and hence a major goal in sarcoma research has been to develop molecular targetted therapies. Our observations that TBX3 expression is elevated in sarcoma cell lines and patient-derived tissue sections representative of both simple (synovial sarcoma) and complex (fibrosarcoma, chondrosarcoma, liposarcoma and embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma) karyotypes suggest that TBX3 is a common feature in multiple signalling networks involved in sarcomagenesis. This raises the possibility that TBX3 may represent a promising diagnostic marker for a diverse range of sarcoma subtypes. Moreover, early and accurate diagnosis of sarcomas is often masked by the high occurrence of benign soft tissue masses that largely outnumber malignant sarcomas. Our observation that TBX3 is expressed in tumour cells and tissues indicates that TBX3 expression may be useful to differentiate sarcomas from benign soft tissue masses which will assist with appropriate treatment planning. However, the sample size of our study was small due to the rarity of these tumours and future studies will be necessary to confirm our observations in many more patient samples. Furthermore, our data showing that depleting TBX3 inhibits the cancer phenotype of several sarcoma subtypes suggests that it may also represent a common target to treat diverse sarcomas.

### Evolving treatment of soft tissue sarcoma [^114v7EQL]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2017). Low credibility.

Soft tissue sarcomas comprise multiple histologic subtypes, occur at a number of anatomic sites, and require individualized treatment. Over the past 5 years, 4 new drugs were approved for sarcoma, most of which are driven by histology or the anticipated response to treatment. Surgical resection remains the primary treatment for resectable tumors. For unresectable or metastatic disease, doxorubicin remains the backbone of chemotherapy, but other agents have improved on its single-agent efficacy. Chief among them is olaratumab, which, in combination with doxorubicin, is preferred over doxorubicin alone in the updated NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology for Soft Tissue Sarcoma.

Soft tissue sarcomas (STS) are malignancies of mesenchymal origin that represent approximately 1% of cancers in adults. Systematic research into the treatment of STS is challenging given its rarity and disease heterogeneity. Despite the ability to histologically subtype STS, only recently has our approach to therapy begun to differentiate along these lines. The purpose of this review is to highlight emerging therapeutic targets and therapies that hold the potential to add to the current state of systemic treatment for STS.

### TIMP-1 gene deficiency increases tumour cell sensitivity to chemotherapy-induced apoptosis [^114R9C3N]. British Journal of Cancer (2006). Low credibility.

Taken together, this raises the hypothesis that TIMP-1 protects cells against chemotherapeutic treatment by inhibiting apoptosis. In order to investigate this hypothesis, we have established TIMP-1 gene deficient and TIMP-1 wild-type fibrosarcoma cell lines from lung tissue originating from littermate mice. We have confirmed these two different TIMP-1 variants by PCR, RT–PCR, Western blotting and ELISA. We have demonstrated that the cells display immortalised and clonogenic growth, showing that the cells had spontaneously transformed to a malignant phenotype. In addition, we have analysed the sensitivity of the cells to chemotherapy-induced apoptosis and shown that TIMP-1 gene-deficient cells are considerably more sensitive to induced apoptosis compared to the corresponding TIMP-1 wild-type cells. This confirms that TIMP-1 plays a role in inhibition of chemotherapy-induced apoptosis in the established cell lines. This cell system represents a powerful tool for further studies of the antiapoptotic role of TIMP-1 in cancer, especially considering the quality of having a model system consisting of gene deficient cells and their identically genetic wild-type control. Furthermore, this cell system can be used to uncover the mechanisms and signalling pathways involved in the TIMP-1-mediated inhibition of apoptosis. Evidence from a number of recent studies suggests that the focal adhesion kinase (FAK)/phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI-3 kinase)/Akt/Bad/Bcl-X L /Bcl-2 signalling pathway is involved in the TIMP-1-mediated inhibition of apoptosis; however, further studies are still needed to identify the mechanisms involved.

Importantly, as suggested by the present study, TIMP-1 may be a new therapeutic target in the optimisation of treatment with conventional anticancer drugs and future studies using this cell system offers the opportunity to investigate this hypothesis.

### Soft-tissue sarcomas of the head and neck: a retrospective analysis of the Alberta experience 1974 to 1999 [^1159sWZg]. The Laryngoscope (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Soft-tissue sarcomas (STS) of the head and neck constitute a heterogeneous group of rare malignant tumors occurring in an uncommon site. The most common subtypes of STS in the head and neck are malignant fibrous histiocytoma, dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans, and fibrosarcoma. Evidence based subtype-specific treatment decisions are often not possible.

Methods

The medical records of 110 patients diagnosed with head and neck sarcomas were reviewed. All were treated at one of the two major Cancer Centers in Alberta, Canada, between 1974 and 1999. Potential prognostic factors including age, sex, tumor size, histology, grade, tumor location (superficial or deep), and use of adjuvant treatment were evaluated. Cox proportional hazards models were developed to study the impact of these covariates on survival.

Results

The median duration of follow-up was 61.5 months. Five year overall, disease specific, and relapse free survival were 65.8%, 83.4%, and 74.2%, respectively. With use of a Cox proportional-hazards model, tumor stage and grade were important prognostic factors affecting survival.

Conclusions

Tumor size and grade were important prognostic factors affecting survival. Tumor location in relation to the superficial fascia (depth) was the best predictor of outcome. The overall and disease-free survival in this patient group was excellent. However, this likely caused by the high proportion of patients with low-grade tumors in our study.

### S-p-bromobenzyl-glutathione cyclopentyl diester (BBGC) as novel therapeutic strategy to enhance trabectedin anti-tumor effect in soft tissue sarcoma preclinical models [^116mCDYx]. Oncogene (2024). Medium credibility.

Trabectedin, approved for the treatment of soft tissue sarcoma (STS), interferes with cell division and genetic transcription processes. Due to its strong anti-tumor activity in only certain histotypes, several studies on trabectedin combinations are currently ongoing to improve its efficacy. In this study, we aimed to investigate novel potential therapeutic strategies to enhance the anti-tumor effect of trabectedin using integrated in silico, in vitro, and in vivo approaches. For in silico analysis, we screened two public datasets, GSEA M5190 and TCGA SARC. Fibrosarcoma, leiomyosarcoma, dedifferentiated, and myxoid liposarcoma cell lines were used for in vitro studies. For in vivo experiments, fibrosarcoma orthotopic murine model was developed. In silico analysis identified Glo1 as the only druggable target upregulated after trabectedin treatment and correlated with poor prognosis. The specific Glo1 inhibitor, S-p-bromobenzylglutathione cyclopentyl diester (BBGC), increased trabectedin cytotoxicity in STS cells, and restored drug sensitivity in myxoid liposarcoma cells resistant to trabectedin. Moreover, the combined treatment with BBGC and trabectedin had a synergistic antitumor effect in vivo without any additional toxicity to mice. Based on these results, we believe that BBGC warrants further investigation to evaluate its potential clinical use in combination with trabectedin.

### Infantile fibrosarcoma of the hand associated with coagulopathy [^112tYb6z]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Large congenital neoplasms of the extremities may be associated with coagulopathies and significant hemorrhage in the neonatal period. At times, the differences between coagulation derangements can be very subtle, leading to errors in diagnosis. Infants with vascular lesions and coagulopathies are often found to have the Kasabach-Merritt phenomenon, which is a platelet-trapping coagulopathy. However, other neoplasms or vascular malformations can be accompanied by disseminated intravascular coagulation. It is important to obtain accurate diagnoses of the neoplasm and the coagulopathy because the treatments of similar-appearing tumors and coagulopathies can be markedly different.

Methods

The authors report the case of a newborn with a congenital tumor of the left hand that was accompanied by a coagulopathy that caused significant bleeding.

Results

A presumption was made by the neonatal critical care physicians and hematologists that the infant had a kaposiform hemangioendothelioma along with the Kasabach-Merritt phenomenon. However, steroid treatment did not reduce the size of the mass or correct the coagulopathy. Only after obtaining consultation with a hand surgeon and a tissue diagnosis was it learned that the patient had an infantile fibrosarcoma that was accompanied by disseminated intravascular coagulation. Limb-sparing resection of the lesion along with chemotherapy markedly improved the patient's condition.

Conclusions

Large congenital neoplasms presenting with attendant bleeding diatheses must be rapidly and accurately diagnosed with both a biopsy-proven tissue diagnosis and a hematologic characterization of the nature of the coagulopathy. The differential diagnosis of a vascular-appearing mass in the extremity can be subtle, and presumptive diagnosis, as occurred in this case, can lead to incorrect or delayed treatment. Specifically, kaposiform hemangioendothelioma must be differentiated from infantile fibrosarcoma. The principles of infantile fibrosarcoma treatment are limb-sparing resection and chemotherapy.

### Lurbinectedin reduces tumour-associated macrophages and the inflammatory tumour microenvironment in preclinical models [^115yV61s]. British Journal of Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

In vivo anti-tumour efficacy of lurbinectedin and effects on the tumour microenvironment

The results presented above with human monocytes raised the question whether the apoptotic-inducing effect of lurbinectedin has a role in its in vivo anti-tumour activity. This was addressed by testing a variant of the fibrosarcoma MN/MCA1 with stable resistance to trabectedin (MN/MCA1-RES), which was confirmed to have cross-resistance with lurbinectedin (Supplementary Figure 2). In previous experiments we reported that the wild-type fibrosarcoma MN/MCA1 is highly susceptible to standard doses of trabectedin and lurbinectedin (0.15 and 0.2 mg kg −1) with a treatment-to-control ratio T/C of 13% and 15%, respectively. Furthermore, spontaneous lung metastases were significantly reduced: untreated (median 45); trabectedin: (median 4); lurbinectedin: (median 2). Thus, the two compounds showed similarly high anti-tumour activity.

In this study, to investigate the tumour microenvironment, we employed doses that did not completely abrogate tumour growth (i.e. 0.10 mg kg −1 of trabectedin and 0.13 mg kg −1 of lurbinectedin, i.v. q7d × 3, in the wild-type MN/MCA1 model; and 0.20 mg kg −1 of lurbinectedin and 0.15 mg kg −1 of trabectedin i.v. q7d × 3, in the resistant model). In vivo treatment of mice bearing the wild-type fibrosarcoma achieved a T/C of 43% and 40% (lurbinectedin and trabectedin) (Figure 3A). In mice bearing the resistant fibrosarcoma, T/C was 53% and 41.5% (Figure 3B).

Risk assessment for adding RT to oncologic resection — determinants and margin considerations: Determining which patients benefit from the addition of RT to oncologic resection requires assessment of local recurrence risk, and this evaluation is complex and considers clinical, pathologic, and surgical factors; these factors include surgical margins, grade, tumor size, anatomic location, and histopathologic subtype. The consequences of a recurrence, impact on functional outcome, and other potential morbidity of future surgical salvage options are also considered when determining the role for RT, and margin status is the major and most consistent factor predictive of local recurrence. While a negative margin resection (R0) is defined as histologically negative margins, there is a lack of international consensus on what constitutes an adequate surgical margin in STS, given the variability in anatomic sites and feasibility of obtaining widely negative margins.

### Chemotherapeutic management of soft tissue sarcoma [^111v1BJB]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

Soft tissue sarcomas are a heterogeneous group of connective tissue tumors, with more than 50 different subtypes. Given the heterogeneity, and the relative small numbers of patients, performing large adequately powered clinical trials in which one can glean any overall broad treatment decisions based on outcome is difficult at best. There is controversy on which chemotherapeutic agents to use in the adjuvant and metastatic settings, or even if to use chemotherapy in the adjuvant setting. In the metastatic setting, doxorubicin and ifosfamide have remained the standards of care for more than 20 years. This review discusses the data on chemotherapy for treatment of metastatic sarcomas and the utility of chemotherapy in the adjuvant and neoadjuvant settings. In addition, the utility of newer biologic agents in the treatment for sarcomas is considered.

Where surgery and RT are indicated, preoperative RT is recommended over postoperative RT (Strength of Recommendation: Strong; Quality of Evidence: Moderate). For patients treated with initial oncologic resection (without preoperative RT) found to have unanticipated adverse pathologic features, postoperative RT is recommended (Strength of Recommendation: Strong; Quality of Evidence: Moderate). Where surgery and RT are indicated, initial oncologic resection followed by postoperative RT is conditionally recommended in specific clinical circumstances (eg, uncontrolled pain or bleeding, fungating tumors), or when the risk of wound healing complications outweighs that of late toxicity (Strength of Recommendation: Conditional; Quality of Evidence: Expert Opinion). Following an unplanned excision where oncologic resection is planned and RT is indicated, preoperative RT is recommended over postoperative RT (Strength of Recommendation: Strong; Quality of Evidence: Moderate). Following an unplanned excision when oncologic resection is not feasible, postoperative RT is recommended (Strength of Recommendation: Strong; Quality of Evidence: Moderate).

### On TRacK with larotrectinib in a neonate with a giant congenital ETV6:: NTRK3 fusion-positive infantile fibrosarcoma of the head and neck [^116TDycV]. Head & Neck (2025). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT

Background

Infantile fibrosarcoma (IFS) is a rare pediatric tumor of intermediate malignancy with high local aggressiveness that typically presents in young infants. Its occurrence in the head and neck region is rare. Complete non‐mutilating surgical resection is often not possible, requiring multimodal treatment. IFS frequently harbors neurotrophic receptor tyrosine kinase (NTRK) fusions. Targeted therapy with NTRK inhibitors is modifying treatment paradigms of IFS.

Methods

Herein, we report the case of a neonate with a giant unresectable congenital ETV6::NTRK3 (+) IFS of the head and neck region without rapid response to chemotherapy who was treated with larotrectinib oral suspension.

Results

Larotrectinib was well tolerated and induced an impressive clinical and radiologic response.

Conclusions

This case illustrates an example of pediatric precision oncology in a neonate with an ETV6::NTRK3 (+) congenital IFS of the head and neck region and provides further reference for the use of larotrectinib in the neonatal period.

### Is 5 the new 25? Long-term oncologic outcomes from a phase II, prospective, 5-fraction preoperative radiation therapy trial in patients with localized soft tissue sarcoma [^113sbryp]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2022). Medium credibility.

More recently, Kalbasi et al prospectively enrolled 52 patients in a phase II preoperative hypofractionation trial. In this study, radiation was delivered over 5 consecutive days to 30 Gy at 6 Gy per fraction with an EQD2 of 50 Gy. Major acute wound complications occurred in 32% of patients, and grade ≥ 2 fibrosis and joint stiffness were present in 11% of patients each. After a minimum 2-year follow-up, local control was 94.3% and 21.2% of patients developed distant disease. In the current study, the primary endpoint was local control, which was 100% in all patients and in those who had a minimum 2-year follow-up. In addition, neoadjuvant chemotherapy was administered in 31% of patients, and the addition of chemotherapy did not influence local control, DMFS (P = 0.66), or OS (P = 0.48).

### Functional combinatorial precision medicine for predicting and optimizing soft tissue sarcoma treatments [^112AjjXm]. NPJ Precision Oncology (2025). Medium credibility.

Precision medicine in cancers traditionally involves linking the genomic and functional signatures of patient tumors to prioritize rational treatments that target the driver alterations in each individual's cancer. This approach often requires the clinical application of omics technologies for which progress has been limited. Most STS patients do not possess any actionable mutations; moreover, this strategy necessitates prior knowledge of established genomic biomarkers of drug responses, which might be lacking in individual cases. To overcome these hurdles, we employed a mechanism-agnostic, quantitative phenotype-based analysis via QPOP in individual tumor samples to rapidly profile patient-specific therapeutic sensitivity and resistance. QPOP bypasses the need for predictive biomarkers to assess drug responses from a functional standpoint. QPOP recommendations were successfully generated for 88% of all samples received and delivered to clinicians within a rapid turnaround time of a week from sample collection to report generation. We further demonstrated concordant QPOP response to clinical outcomes and showed that QPOP can effectively guide clinicians by expanding on, and ranking all available treatment options in patients with limited options. As highlighted in our first patient (Fig. 2), inter-tumor heterogeneity and differential drug response between lesions may exist. However, it is also possible to identify drugs that share a common sensitivity across lesions, as demonstrated with eribulin which showed remarkable clinical efficacy. Nevertheless, the ability to identify effective drugs in rare sarcomas with no other systemic options remains highly valuable in the clinic. Taken together, our study not only represents one of the largest STS cohorts for which ex vivo drug testing was achieved, but also showcased the value of QPOP in the rare disease space for which clinical decisions are hindered by the design of trials to identify effective regimens.

Regarding medical management for soft tissue sarcoma, more specifically with respect to management of localized disease, wide excision, ERN GENTURIS/ESMO/EURACAN 2021 guidelines recommend to recognize that the sequence of the two treatments varies among institutions, but there is an overall shift towards the use of preoperative radiotherapy, especially when preserving a critical structure is one of the goals. Consider omitting radiotherapy only after multidisciplinary discussion in reference centers considering several variables.

### Radiation therapy for treatment of soft tissue sarcoma in adults: executive summary of an ASTRO clinical practice guideline [^116UJBMT]. Practical Radiation Oncology (2021). High credibility.

Soft tissue sarcoma — scenarios for omission of RT and surgery-alone management describe when surgery may suffice. There are certain clinical scenarios for which the omission of RT is reasonable, particularly when patients with smaller (T1 ≤ 5 cm), usually low grade, and superficial (ie, external to fascia) tumors can often be managed with surgery alone when wide margins are obtainable. When patients are appropriately selected for this approach, similar local control is achievable with surgery alone as those treated with the addition of RT, and nomograms have been developed and are available in the medical literature that may aid practitioners and patients in decision-making regarding whether RT might be omitted.

First-line treatment in STS

Cytotoxic agents

Doxorubicin and ifosfamide have been used in STS for more than 30 years and remain the cornerstone for the treatment of metastatic disease. Nevertheless, whether doxorubicin alone or the combination of doxorubicin and ifosfamide should be used routinely remains debatable. The results from a large, prospective, randomised trial, which compared full-dose doxorubicin–ifosfamide versus doxorubicin alone in patients with advanced STS of all types showed no significant difference in OS between groups (14.3 vs. 12.8 months, respectively, P = 0.076). Conversely, a significant advantage in both progression free survival (PFS; 7.4 vs. 4.6 months, P = 0.003) and overall response rate (ORR; 26% vs. 14%, P < 0.0006) was highlighted in the group treated with doxorubicin and ifosfamide. Therefore, it could be reasonable to advocate the use of the combination in fit patients, when disease shrinkage is desirable in order to achieve surgical resection or improve symptom control. Nevertheless, the pooling of several histologies, particularly at a time when different agents have been proven to exert selective activity in specific subtypes, represents a strong limitation in the study. Histology should be considered during decision-making, extending the use of the combination to those subtypes that could benefit more from ifosfamide addition (i.e. synovial sarcoma). Conversely, according to the available retrospective data, the activity of ifosfamide is limited in leiomyosarcoma; in this subtype, the combination of doxorubicin and dacarbazine is a potential multi-agent first-line treatment option. Given the key role of doxorubicin in the treatment of STS, several types of anthracycline have been recently tested in first-line treatment, with the view of improving the outcome in patients with advanced disease.

### Intratumoral combination therapy with poly (I: C) and resiquimod synergistically triggers tumor-associated macrophages for effective systemic antitumoral immunity [^115R8AhP]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) play a key immunosuppressive role that limits the ability of the immune system to fight cancer and hinder the antitumoral efficacy of most treatments currently applied in the clinic. Previous studies have evaluated the antitumoral immune response triggered by (TLR) agonists, such as poly(I:C), imiquimod (R837) or resiquimod (R848) as monotherapies; however, their combination for the treatment of cancer has not been explored. This study investigates the antitumoral efficacy and the macrophage reprogramming triggered by poly(I:C) combined with R848 or with R837, versus single treatments.

Methods

TLR agonist treatments were evaluated in vitro for toxicity and immunostimulatory activity by Alamar Blue, ELISA and flow cytometry using primary human and murine M-CSF-differentiated macrophages. Cytotoxic activity of TLR-treated macrophages toward cancer cells was evaluated with an in vitro functional assay by flow cytometry. For in vivo experiments, the CMT167 lung cancer model and the MN/MCA1 fibrosarcoma model metastasizing to lungs were used; tumor-infiltrating leukocytes were evaluated by flow cytometry, RT-qPCR, multispectral immunophenotyping, quantitative proteomic experiments, and protein–protein interaction analysis.

Results

Results demonstrated the higher efficacy of poly(I:C) combined with R848 versus single treatments or combined with R837 to polarize macrophages toward M1-like antitumor effectors in vitro. In vivo, the intratumoral synergistic combination of poly(I:C)+R848 significantly prevented tumor growth and metastasis in lung cancer and fibrosarcoma immunocompetent murine models. Regressing tumors showed increased infiltration of macrophages with a higher M1:M2 ratio, recruitment of CD4 + and CD8 + T cells, accompanied by a reduction of immunosuppressive CD206 + TAMs and FOXP3 + /CD4 + T cells. The depletion of both CD4 + and CD8 + T cells resulted in complete loss of treatment efficacy. Treated mice acquired systemic antitumoral response and resistance to tumor rechallenge mediated by boosted macrophage cytotoxic activity and T-cell proliferation. Proteomic experiments validate the superior activation of innate immunity by poly(I:C)+R848 combination versus single treatments or poly(I:C)+R837, and protein–protein-interaction network analysis reveal the key activation of the STAT1 pathway.

Discussion

These findings demonstrate the antitumor immune responses mediated by macrophage activation on local administration of poly(I:C)+R848 combination and support the intratumoral application of this therapy to patients with solid tumors in the clinic.

### Brief report: potent clinical and radiological response to larotrectinib in TRK fusion-driven high-grade glioma [^112UtZvM]. British Journal of Cancer (2018). Low credibility.

Genes encoding TRK are oncogenic drivers in multiple tumour types including infantile fibrosarcoma, papillary thyroid cancer and high-grade gliomas (HGG). TRK fusions have a critical role in tumourigenesis in 40% of infant HGG. Here we report the first case of a TRK fusion-driven HGG treated with larotrectinib — the first selective pan-TRK inhibitor in clinical development. This 3-year-old girl had failed multiple therapies including chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Tumour profiling confirmed an ETV6–NTRK3 fusion. Treatment with larotrectinib led to rapid clinical improvement with near total resolution of primary and metastatic lesions on MRI imaging. This is the first report of a TRK fusion glioma successfully treated with a TRK inhibitor.

### Adjuvant chemotherapy for soft tissue sarcomas [^114PhSse]. Surgical Oncology Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Soft tissue sarcomas are rare mesenchymal neoplasms with considerable heterogeneity in biologic behavior and response to systemic therapy. Most patients present with localized disease and are potentially curable with multidisciplinary treatment. In patients with a high risk of developing metastatic disease, optimal use of neoadjuvant/adjuvant therapy has a definite role in improving patient outcomes by decreasing local and distant recurrences. Histology-specific clinical trials enrolling a homogenous high-risk population have been more successful in demonstrating benefit than larger trials with unselected heterogeneous patient populations. In specific histologic subtypes responsive to chemotherapy, neoadjuvant chemotherapy with close monitoring of response is recommended.
