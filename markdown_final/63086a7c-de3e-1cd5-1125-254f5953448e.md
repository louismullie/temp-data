## Question

When a patient is not more contagious once get diagnosed with HFMD

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking when a patient with hand-foot-and-mouth disease (HFMD) is no longer contagious. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the highest-quality sources that define the infectious period. Then, I should verify how contagiousness varies by timing and by virus serotype. Next, I will examine the implications of asymptomatic shedding and what that means for return-to-school or daycare decisions. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, clinically actionable timeline and highlight exceptions and caveats, making sure I anchor each point to the best available evidence.

> Let me first confirm the core answer from authoritative sources. Patients with HFMD are usually most contagious during the first week of illness, but they can continue to shed virus in stool for days to weeks after symptoms resolve, which means contagiousness does not abruptly stop at symptom resolution and can persist even when the child looks well [^f522f73e] [^eabfd0c4].

> Wait, let me verify the timing details so I don't overstate this. The CDC notes peak contagiousness in the first week, while the AAFP review explicitly states that active virus may be present in stool for four to eight weeks after onset, which explains why transmission risk lingers even after clinical recovery. This is consistent with virologic studies showing prolonged fecal shedding across serotypes, reinforcing the need for sustained hygiene precautions [^f522f73e] [^eabfd0c4] [^80e48125].

> Hold on, I should verify how serotype affects shedding dynamics, because this can influence how long we counsel families to maintain precautions. A systematic review and meta-analysis found that in the first five weeks after onset, pooled virus-positive rates declined but remained substantial, with CVA16 and CVA6 around 50% positive in week 3, and EV71 reaching a 50% positive rate by week 4, indicating that different viruses have somewhat different shedding trajectories even though all can persist beyond the symptomatic period [^80e48125].

> I need to check the implication of asymptomatic transmission, because this is where families often get confused. Even after symptoms resolve, many children continue to shed enterovirus in stool, and a meaningful fraction of infections are asymptomatic altogether, so absence of symptoms does not equal absence of contagiousness. This is why hand hygiene and surface disinfection remain critical for several weeks after illness onset [^f522f73e] [^eabfd0c4].

> Let me consider the practical, clinical timeline and make sure it aligns with public health guidance. For return to group settings, many schools and childcare programs use a symptom-based approach rather than a strict test-based clearance, typically allowing return once the child is afebrile, feels well enough to participate, and oral lesions have crusted or healed, while emphasizing strict handwashing because fecal shedding persists. This balances transmission risk with developmental and family needs, but families should be counseled that stool shedding can continue for weeks and to maintain hygiene at home [^f522f73e] [^eabfd0c4].

> But wait, what if the child had severe disease or is immunocompromised? I should double-check whether that changes recommendations. Severe HFMD, particularly with EV71, does not necessarily extend the shedding period in a way that changes standard precautions, but clinicians may individualize return-to-school decisions based on clinical trajectory and local outbreak context, while still relying on hygiene measures rather than prolonged isolation, given the lack of evidence that extended isolation beyond symptom resolution meaningfully reduces community transmission in typical settings [^f522f73e] [^eabfd0c4].

> I will now examine the bottom line and make sure I'm not missing a nuance. A patient with HFMD is not "no longer contagious" simply because they have been diagnosed; in fact, they are often most contagious in the first week and can remain contagious for weeks thereafter due to persistent fecal shedding, so the correct counseling is that contagiousness declines after the first week but does not end when symptoms resolve, necessitating continued hand hygiene and surface cleaning for several weeks [^f522f73e] [^eabfd0c4] [^80e48125].

---

Patients with HFMD are **most contagious during the first week of illness** [^f522f73e], especially when fever and active lesions are present [^eabfd0c4]. However, the virus can persist in stool for **4–8 weeks** [^eabfd0c4] [^80e48125], so patients remain contagious to varying degrees for weeks after symptoms resolve. Contagiousness drops significantly after the first week but **does not end at diagnosis**; strict hand hygiene and avoidance of close contact are essential to limit transmission [^1a19679c] [^f9afb323].

---

## Infectious period of HFMD

The infectious period of HFMD **varies by symptom stage and virus shedding**:

| **Phase of illness** | **Contagiousness level** | **Key evidence** |
|-|-|-|
| First week of illness (acute phase) | High contagiousness | - Patients are most infectious during the first week [^f522f73e] <br/> - Virus is present in saliva, nasal secretions, blister fluid, and feces [^f522f73e] [^83584cfb] |
| After first week (convalescent phase) | Moderate contagiousness | - Virus shedding declines but persists in stool for 4–8 weeks [^eabfd0c4] [^80e48125] <br/> - Household transmission rates remain substantial (52–84%) [^eabfd0c4] |
| Asymptomatic carriers | Low to moderate contagiousness | - Asymptomatic individuals can shed virus and transmit disease [^f522f73e] [^e7e52adc] |

---

## Factors influencing contagiousness

Several factors **influence the duration and level of contagiousness** in HFMD:

- **Age**: Younger children (≤ 5 years) are more contagious due to higher viral loads and poorer hygiene [^eabfd0c4] [^c14c1a09].
- **Immune status**: Immunocompromised patients may shed virus longer and remain contagious for extended periods.
- **Virus serotype**: EV71 may persist longer and cause more severe disease, potentially extending contagiousness [^80e48125] [^ed2089b5].

---

## Clinical guidelines on contagion and isolation

Current clinical guidelines emphasize the following:

- **Isolation**: Patients should avoid close contact, especially with young children, for at least the first week of illness [^f522f73e].
- **Hand hygiene**: Strict handwashing is critical to reduce transmission, especially given prolonged fecal shedding [^1a19679c] [^f9afb323].
- **Return to school/daycare**: Children may return once fever resolves, lesions crust, and they feel well, but hygiene measures should continue due to ongoing fecal shedding [^f522f73e].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Patients with HFMD are **most contagious during the first week** [^f522f73e] but can remain contagious for weeks due to persistent fecal shedding [^80e48125]. Diagnosis does not mark the end of contagiousness; therefore, strict hygiene and avoidance of close contact are essential to limit transmission [^1a19679c].

### Hand-foot-and-mouth disease: rapid evidence review [^83584cfb]. American Family Physician (2019). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on hand-foot-and-mouth disease:

- **Definition**: HFMD is a common viral illness caused by enteroviruses, primarily affecting infants and children, although it can occasionally occur in adults.
- **Pathophysiology**: HFMD is caused by enteroviruses, most commonly Coxsackievirus A16 and Enterovirus 71. It transmitted through direct contact with the saliva, nasal mucus, blister fluid, and feces of infected individuals.
- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of HFMD in China is estimated at 197 per 100,000 person-years. HFMD shows seasonal variation, with a peak in cases typically occurring in spring and early summer, and possesses the potential to escalate to epidemic levels.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for HFMD include young age, having close contact with infected individuals, being in group settings like schools or daycare centers, the summer and early fall seasons, and poor hygiene practices.
- **Disease course**: The clinical manifestations of HFMD typically include fever, sore throat, and a characteristic skin rash that presents as small, red, painful papules progressing to blisters on the hands, feet, and sometimes in the mouth, which can subsequently develop into ulcers.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The disease course is generally self-limiting, with symptoms resolving within a week without specific treatment. However, in rare cases, severe cardiac and neurologic complications can occur.

### Workshop on use of intravenous immunoglobulin in hand, foot and mouth disease in southeast Asia [^7d8ec5b9]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

The South East Asia Infectious Disease Clinical Research Network convened subject matter experts at a workshop to make consensus recommendations for study design of a clinical trial for use of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) in severe hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD). HFMD is a highly contagious emerging infection among children in the region, a small proportion of whom develop neurologic and cardiopulmonary complications with high case-fatality rates. The use of IVIg for treatment of severe disease is widespread and a part of local, national, and international guidelines, but no clinical evidence warrants the use of this drug, which is expensive and has potentially serious side effects. During a 2-day workshop in March 2014, a group of HFMD experts reviewed the current evidence related to use of IVIg in HFMD and discussed potential study design, feasibility, inclusion and exclusion criteria, sample size, primary and secondary endpoints, and subsidiary studies for a randomized, placebo-controlled trial.

### Atypical presentations of hand, foot, and mouth disease caused by coxsackievirus A6 – Minnesota, 2014 [^8b3ebc53]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2015). Low credibility.

HFMD is a common, contagious childhood disease caused by members of the genus Enterovirus, usually the coxsackieviruses. HFMD is typically a mild, febrile illness, characterized by mouth sores and a red, sometimes blistery rash involving the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. Nail loss occasionally occurs, often weeks after symptom onset. In the United States, HFMD is commonly caused by coxsackievirus A16. Cases of HFMD with atypical rashes, involving the arms, legs, trunk, perioral regions, buttocks, and genitalia have been recently reported in association with CVA6. Although HFMD is most common among children aged ≤ 5 years, adults can also be infected. However, clusters of HFMD in adults are unusual.

During 2011–2012, an outbreak of HFMD caused by CVA6 occurred in North America. Sixty-three cases were reported to CDC, including 15 among adults. Approximately 50% of the adult patients had reported exposure to children with HFMD. The college outbreak reported here might also have begun with an exposure to a symptomatic child. The spread of HFMD among adults in a college setting has not been previously described.

Most cases of HFMD are mild and treatment is supportive, although CVA6 has been associated with more severe disease. HFMD is transmitted person-to-person through contact with vesicle fluid, respiratory secretions, and feces. Hand washing and routine disinfection of surfaces help prevent spread. Awareness of unusual features of CVA6, including the occurrence of a varicella-like rash (,–) or a rash with an atypical distribution, can assist health care providers in diagnosing HFMD and recommending appropriate care.

### Hand-foot-and-mouth disease: rapid evidence review… [^eabfd0c4]. AAFP (2019). Medium credibility.

Hand-foot-and-mouth disease is a common viral disease that presents in primary care. This article presents a brief summary and review of the etiology, clinical features, diagnosis, prognosis, and evidence for the care of patients with hand-foot-and-mouth disease. Epidemiology Hand-foot-and-mouth disease was first described after an outbreak in Canada in the 1950s. 1It is caused by picornaviruses, specifically human enteroviruses and coxsackieviruses. 2 The most common viruses that cause hand-foot-and-mouth disease are enterovirus 71 and coxsackievirus A16. 2Currently, hand-foot-and-mouth disease is not listed as a notifiable condition in the United States by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; however, it has been a reportable illness in the Western Pacific region, where there are more severe outbreaks. 3–5 Coxsackievirus A6 can cause severe disease manifestations with atypical lesions such as vesicles, bullae, and scabs on the trunk, extremities, and face.

Transmission Humans are the only carrier for hand-foot-and-mouth disease–causing viruses. 1The disease is spread by fecal-oral, oral-oral, and respiratory droplet contact. 10 The patient is most infectious during the first week of illness 7; however, an active virus may be present in the stool for up to four to eight weeks. 10Therefore, the household transmission rate for hand-foot-and-mouth disease enterovirus 71 is 52% to 84%.
10. Clinical Features Hand-foot-and-mouth disease is a clinical diagnosis based on the presentation of a low-grade fever with a maculopapular or papulovesicular rash on the hands and soles of the feet and by painful oral ulcerations. 7 If the diagnosis is unclear, serologic and polymerase chain reaction studies may be obtained to detect enterovirus or coxsackievirus. 1, 4, 5, 12. 39and the potential for harm. 40 Antiviral treatments are not available.

One clinical trial of acyclovir reported a reduction of fever and skin changes within 24 hours; however, more evidence is needed. 41 Indications for hospitalization include a failure to maintain adequate hydration or the development of neurologic or cardiopulmonary complications.

### Virus shedding in patients with hand, foot and mouth disease induced by EV71, CA16 or CA6: systematic review and meta-analysis [^80e48125]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

As the highly contagious hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) spreads rapidly among children, isolation is the most effective way to control its spread. However, studies on the duration of virus shedding of the HFMD-related enterovirus and a reasonable quarantine period for HFMD patients are inconsistent.

Methods

We undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis evaluating the viral shedding of patients with HFMD caused by Enterovirus 71 (EV71) and coxsackievirus A16 (CVA16) and coxsackievirus A6.

Results

A total of 17 observational studies evaluating 626 participants were included. In the first 5 weeks after onset, the pooled virus positive rate in specimens of EV71-related patients decreased from 0.79 (P < 0.001 for heterogeneity) to 0.38 (P < 0.001 for heterogeneity). The positive rate of CVA16 was reduced from 0.91 (P < 0.001 for heterogeneity) to 0.29 (P < 0.001 for heterogeneity). The positive rates of CVA16 and coxsackievirus A6 were approximately 50% in the third week after onset, while a 50% positive rate appeared in the fourth week in EV71 related cases.

Conclusions

We found the positive rates of virus shedding were still high among the patients released from quarantine, and the duration of viral shedding was inconsistent among HFMD patients caused by different serotypes. Our findings provide comprehensive evidence for a possible flexible quarantine period according to the serotype.

Search Strategy and Selection Criteria

Using a combination of search terms, including "Hand foot and mouth disease," "Hand foot and mouth," "HFMD," "Enterovirus," "Enterovirus 71," "EV-A71," "Coxsackie A16," "CV-A16," "CVA16," we searched PubMed, Thomson Reuters Web of Science and Google Scholar to identify 1305, 1255 and 100 articles, respectively.

Eligibility criteria were articles that: (1) were published in peer-reviewed journals from January 1957 to December 2014; (2) were studies with epidemiologic and/or serologic information (quantitative/qualitative) about incidence and prevalence of HFMD; and/or (3) contained information about factors associated with prevalence and incidence and/or (4) employed statistical models to derive the above. Articles not in English, not related to HFMD, or HFMD articles that did not cover epidemiologic or clinical factors were excluded.

Two independent readers examined each of the 407 abstracts to determine if specific research questions were answered. The 8 specific research questions were as follows: (1) What time of the year do HFMD outbreaks occur, and with what seasonal factors are outbreaks associated? (2) How long have EV-A71 and CV-A16 been circulating in Asia? (3) What age groups are at higher risk of infection? (4) What risk factors are associated with infection and severe outcomes? (5) Where do infections predominantly occur (home or school)? (6) What is the incubation period? (7) What proportion of infections are symptomatic? and (8) What is the basic reproduction number for HFMD by virus? An article was retained as long as both readers indicated that it answered at least 1 specific research question and was discarded if both readers agreed that no questions were answered. A third independent reader arbitrated when there was a disparity between the original readers.

### Coxsackievirus B5 associated with hand-foot-mouth disease in a healthy adult [^06875797]. JAAD Case Reports (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Hand-foot-mouth disease (HFMD) is an acute and highly contagious viral exanthem that commonly affects children younger than 5 years. The infection can be symptomatic and the clinical manifestations include mild fever with a characteristic vesicular eruption on the hands, feet, and oral cavity. Historically, HFMD is known as a self-limited disease process. However, recurrent outbreaks over the last 2 decades in the Asian and Pacific populations have caused severe illness and debilitating complications, even death. In addition, North American outbreaks were recently documented and have affected unexpected numbers of healthy adults and children. The purpose of this case report is to present an atypical case of HFMD in a healthy adult caused by coxsackievirus B5 and to recognize the potential danger of HFMD epidemics.

### Coxsackievirus A6-induced hand-foot-mouth disease [^8304953c]. JAMA Dermatology (2013). Medium credibility.

Importance

Hand-foot-mouth disease (HFMD) is an acute, self-limited, highly contagious viral illness that commonly affects children younger than 5 years. It is most typically caused by enterovirus 71 or coxsackievirus A16 and results in asymptomatic infection or mild disease. Immunocompetent adults are rarely affected. Recently, there have been increasing reports of a more severe form of HFMD associated with fevers, joint pains, and widespread painful eruptions. Some of these patients required hospitalization for supportive care. These severe cases were most commonly caused by coxsackievirus A6.

Observations

We describe a 37-year-old white man with widespread, crusted, pruritic papules on the scalp, ears, and face and a purpuric and targetoid painful vesicular eruption on his hands and feet, with associated fevers, neurologic symptoms, and arthritis, who required hospitalization for supportive care. His infection with coxsackievirus A6 was confirmed based on polymerase chain reaction from his oral mucosa and cutaneous vesicle fluid.

Conclusions and Relevance

Dermatologists should be familiar with the severe variant of HFMD caused by coxsackievirus A6, include it in their differential diagnosis of acute febrile blistering diseases, and be aware that certain patients may require hospitalization.

### The epidemiology of hand, foot and mouth disease in Asia: a systematic review and analysis [^5f1a06a2]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Context

Hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) is a widespread pediatric disease caused primarily by human enterovirus 71 (EV-A71) and Coxsackievirus A16 (CV-A16).

Objective

This study reports a systematic review of the epidemiology of HFMD in Asia.

Data Sources

PubMed, Web of Science and Google Scholar were searched up to December 2014.

Study Selection

Two reviewers independently assessed studies for epidemiologic and serologic information about prevalence and incidence of HFMD against predetermined inclusion/exclusion criteria.

Data Extraction

Two reviewers extracted answers for 8 specific research questions on HFMD epidemiology. The results are checked by 3 others.

Results

HFMD is found to be seasonal in temperate Asia with a summer peak and in subtropical Asia with spring and fall peaks, but not in tropical Asia; evidence of a climatic role was identified for temperate Japan. Risk factors for HFMD include hygiene, age, gender and social contacts, but most studies were underpowered to adjust rigorously for confounding variables. Both community-level and school-level transmission have been implicated, but their relative importance for HFMD is inconclusive. Epidemiologic indices are poorly understood: No supporting quantitative evidence was found for the incubation period of EV-A71; the symptomatic rate of EV-A71/Coxsackievirus A16 infection was from 10% to 71% in 4 studies; while the basic reproduction number was between 1.1 and 5.5 in 3 studies. The uncertainty in these estimates inhibits their use for further analysis.

Limitations

Diversity of study designs complicates attempts to identify features of HFMD epidemiology.

Conclusions

Knowledge on HFMD remains insufficient to guide interventions such as the incorporation of an EV-A71 vaccine in pediatric vaccination schedules. Research is urgently needed to fill these gaps.

### Climate change and children's health: building a healthy future for every child [^ac91557a]. Pediatrics (2024). High credibility.

Hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) and climate associations — HFMD, a common human enterovirus infection, is generally mild and self-limited in the United States where it tends to have a single seasonal peak, but in Asia over the past few decades it has caused large-scale outbreaks of more severe disease; a literature review identified a positive, statistically significant relationship between HFMD cases and both temperature and relative humidity, whereas no significant relationship was identified between HFMD and wind speed, sunshine, and/or precipitation.

### The epidemiology of hand, foot and mouth disease in Asia: a systematic review and analysis [^3fbd452c]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) has become an endemic childhood disease in East and Southeast Asia. Its main etiologic agents are human enterovirus 71 (EV-A71) and Coxsackievirus 16 (CV-A16). Although usually mild — with symptoms limited to > 38°C fever, malaise, rashes on the volar regions of the hands and feet, herpangina and difficulty eating and drinking — more rarely, infection can lead to complications of the nervous or cardiopulmonary systems. Such cases can result in long-term sequelae such as cognitive and motor disorders, or death, usually from pulmonary edema or brainstem encephalitis. Although complications are rare, the number of children being infected in high-incidence countries such as China (≈2.7 M cases in 2014) means the death toll can be substantial (384 deaths in China in 2014). The EV-A71 virus seems to be responsible for more severe outcomes, while CV-A16 and other Coxsackieviruses, such as CV-A2, CV-A6 and CV-A10, usually present milder symptoms that resolve within a few weeks. –

There are nearly 25 years of literature from Asia that describes the epidemiology of HFMD, drawing on pediatric cohorts, national surveillance systems, outbreak investigations and clinical data, and from disparate countries that span stages of economic development and with climates that range from tropical to temperate. This diversity complicates attempts to identify general features of HFMD epidemiology and conceals gaps in the body of knowledge of this important pediatric disease.

The objective of this paper is to provide a robust systematic review of the epidemiology of HFMD that informs public health policy making about HFMD epidemics. The review covers 3 major areas: (1) history and seasonality of HFMD, and the efforts in predictive modeling; (2) risk factors for infection, to guide control and (3) global epidemiologic parameters, such as the incubation period and basic reproduction number, which may determine the effectiveness of control policies.

### Changing epidemiology of hand, foot, and mouth disease causative agents and contributing factors [^7d4b1990]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2024). Medium credibility.

Hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) is a common viral infection primarily affecting children. It causes vesicles on the skin and inside the mouth. Although most cases get better on their own, severe cases can lead to complications such as brain stem encephalitis, meningoencephalitis, acute flaccid paralysis, and pulmonary edema. Hand, foot, and mouth disease is caused by various enteroviruses, with enterovirus A71 (EV-A71) and coxsackievirus A16 being the most common. However, recent studies have shown a shift in the molecular epidemiology of HFMD-causing pathogens, with coxsackievirus A6 and coxsackievirus A10 causing more infections. In addition, extensive recombination events have been identified among enterovirus strains, which may have a role in faster evolution and extinction of dominant enterovirus serotypes. Other strains of enterovirus can also cause severe complications, and there has been an increase in mortality associated with brain stem encephalitis in children under 3 years of age and teenagers. Currently, there are no effective antiviral therapies available to treat enterovirus infections. Vaccines against EV-A71 have been approved and are now used in mainland China. Studying the changing epidemiology of HFMD pathogens and the evolution patterns of its causative agents is crucial in developing effective prevention and control strategies. Increased interest in the molecular epidemiology of HFMD causative agents has led to a better understanding of the critical drivers of HFMD outbreaks, which can inform efforts to prevent and control the disease.

### Severity and burden of hand, foot and mouth disease in Asia: a modelling study [^98f38f5c]. BMJ Global Health (2018). Medium credibility.

Such a high asymptomatic rate for HFMD has implications on estimates of R 0, the basic reproduction number. A large proportion of unobserved infections imparts a downward bias on estimated infection rate parameters in compartmental models (such as susceptible-infected-removed variants) that assume all cases are symptomatic, and accounting for the high asymptomatic rate could be the key to reconciling the highly heterogeneous R 0 estimates in the literature, which vary from almost unity to over 20. Other assumptions that may not always be justified include the assumption that the entire population of a school are susceptible before each outbreak.

When performing data synthesis, there is a particular challenge in the allocation of collected information into the severity tiers defined in this study. For instance, we were concerned that the identified EV-A71 cases in the literature were subject to selection bias as it is more likely for physicians to take samples from sicker children. We therefore excluded studies that reported clinically diagnosed cases of EV-A71 because of this potential for bias, and as a result, the lowest level on the severity pyramid we could estimate for EV-A71 was 'hospitalisations' rather than 'symptomatic cases'. To obtain the CFR for EV-A71, therefore, required assuming the case hospitalisation rate is the same for EV-A71 and other aetiologies (ie, 6%, 95% CI 2.8% to 14.9%, table 1). This is a lower bound estimate since EV-A71 is usually more severe than others. Under that assumption, the CFR of EV-A71 infection is at least 0.23% (0.075% to 0.67%, table 1). This estimate is lower by a factor of 7 than the 2015 systematic review of EV-A71 CFR of 1.7% (1.2% to 2.4%)which we attribute to a difference in denominator, with the Zhao review more in line with our estimated hospitalisation fatality rate of 3.8% (1.7% to 7.0%, table 1). Based on symptomatic CFRs, EV-A71 is less severe than the relatively mild influenza A(H1N1-2009pdm) strain, which had a symptomatic CFR ranged between 0% and 1.2% in 50 published studies reviewed in ref. Our other estimates, of case hospitalisation, case severity and CFRs of symptomatic HFMD, align with those from an epidemiological analysis of Chinese data, giving credibility to both sets of estimates.

### Neutralizing antibodies against enteroviruses in patients with hand, foot and mouth disease [^f75d5ca2]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) is an emerging infection with pandemic potential. Knowledge of neutralizing antibody responses among its pathogens is essential to inform vaccine development and epidemiologic research. We used 120 paired-plasma samples collected at enrollment and > 7 days after the onset of illness from HFMD patients infected with enterovirus A71 (EV-A71), coxsackievirus A (CVA) 6, CVA10, and CVA16 to study cross neutralization. For homotypic viruses, seropositivity increased from < 60% at enrollment to 97%-100% at follow-up, corresponding to seroconversion rates of 57%-93%. Seroconversion for heterotypic viruses was recorded in only 3%-23% of patients. All plasma samples from patients infected with EV-A71 subgenogroup B5 could neutralize the emerging EV-A71 subgenogroup C4. Collectively, our results support previous reports about the potential benefit of EV-A71 vaccine but highlight the necessity of multivalent vaccines to control HFMD.

### Notes from the field: outbreak of hand, foot, and mouth disease caused by coxsackievirus A6 among basic military trainees-Texas, 2015… [^677e1212]. CDC (2019). Medium credibility.

A viral infection was considered most likely because of the patient's age, absence of fever or constitutional symptoms, and the distribution and morphology of the lesions. The initial differential diagnosis included Henoch-Schönlein purpura, parvovirus B19, and Rocky Mountain spotted fever. However, the clinical signs, including the unique morphology and distribution of grouped vesicles and papules was suggestive of hand, foot, and mouth disease, although the patient did not have oral lesions and reported no contact with another person with HFMD. A viral culture and punch biopsy of one of the lesions were obtained. A suspected case of HFMD was defined as the occurrence of multiple erythematous papulovesicular lesions on the legs, arms, face, or oral mucosa in a person involved in basic military training activities at Lackland AFB during July 6–September 18.

A confirmed case was defined as an illness meeting the clinical case definition with laboratory identification of an enterovirus. This method most likely captured all cases of HFMD occurring on the installation during the defined period: basic trainees are in a closed environment under strict supervision, and all basic training instructors were directed to have any trainee displaying symptoms be seen by a provider on base. Eight of 12 nasopharyngeal specimens tested locally by reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction were positive for enterovirus. HFMD typically occurs in children in the United States during summer and autumn. Clinical manifestations usually begin with fever and malaise and can progress to painful oral lesions and a rash involving the hands and feet; infected adults often are asymptomatic.

Although coxsackievirus A16 has historically been the primary etiologic agent of HFMD in the United States, CVA6 has emerged as the cause in many recently reported outbreaks, but the disease was confined to 20 of the 117 basic military training units on the installation during the outbreak period. All 53 cases resolved spontaneously with supportive therapy; none required hospitalization. HFMD infection is primarily determined by clinical diagnosis because CVA6 is a fastidious enterovirus and typically does not easily grow in culture; VP1 RT-PCR followed by sequencing and sequence analysis can be used to confirm the diagnosis. Measures to prevent transmission should be implemented as soon as clinical suspicion of the disease occurs.

### Severity and burden of hand, foot and mouth disease in Asia: a modelling study [^a411bf42]. BMJ Global Health (2018). Medium credibility.

Background

Hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) affects millions of children across Asia annually, leading to an increase in implemented control policies such as surveillance, isolation and social distancing in affected jurisdictions. However, limited knowledge of disease burden and severity causes difficulty in policy optimisation as the associated economic cost cannot be easily estimated. We use a data synthesis approach to provide a comprehensive picture of HFMD disease burden, estimating infection risk, symptomatic rates, the risk of complications and death, and overall disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) losses, along with associated uncertainties.

Methods

Complementary data from a variety of sources were synthesised with mathematical models to obtain estimates of severity of HFMD. This includes serological and other data extracted through a systematic review of HFMD epidemiology previously published by the authors, and laboratory investigations and sentinel reports from Singapore's surveillance system.

Results

HFMD is estimated to cause 96900 (95% CI 40600 to 259000) age-weighted DALYs per annum in eight high-burden countries in East and Southeast Asia, with the majority of DALYs attributed to years of life lost. The symptomatic case hospitalisation rate of HFMD is 6% (2.8%-14.9%), of which 18.7% (6.7%-31.5%) are expected to develop complications. 5% (2.9%-7.4%) of such cases are fatal, bringing the overall case fatality ratio to be 52.3 (24.4–92.7) per 100000 symptomatic infections. In contrast, the EV-A71 case fatality ratio is estimated to be at least 229.7 (75.4–672.1) per 100000 symptomatic cases. Asymptomatic rate for EV-A71 is 71.4% (68.3%-74.3%) for ages 1–4, the years of greatest incidence.

Conclusion

Despite the high incidence rate of HFMD, total DALY due to HFMD is limited in comparison to other endemic diseases in the region, such as dengue and upper respiratory tract infection. With the majority of DALY caused by years of life lost, it is possible to mitigate most with increased EV-A71 vaccine coverage.

### Coxsackievirus B5 associated with hand-foot-mouth disease in a healthy adult [^caf0dae3]. JAAD Case Reports (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

HFMD is a highly contagious childhood exanthem caused by viruses that belong to the genus Enterovirus in the Picornaviridae family. It is classically characterized by a papulovesicular eruption on the hands and feet and within the oral cavity. Enteroviruses are spread by direct vesicular contact and fecal-oral and respiratory routes. Prodromal symptoms may consist of fever, malaise, abdominal pain, poor appetite, sore throat, and myalgias. After a 3- to 7-day incubation period, painful oral ulcers are usually the first clinical signs of the disease, with skin manifestations occurring concurrently or shortly after. Complete resolution of symptoms typically occurs by 7 to 10 days and treatment is mainly supportive.

After reviewing the literature, it is unclear whether there are significant differences in the disease course and outcome of HFMD depending on the pathogen responsible. The most common causes of HFMD are CVA16 followed by Enterovirus 71 (HEV71). Recent data show that CVA6, CVA10, and CVB5 are becoming common as well. In 2014, Hubiche et alset out to characterize the dermatologic spectrum of HFMD in 82 patients with confirmed and serotyped disease and found most patients were infected with CVA6 (51.2%) and CVA16 (34.1%). Patients infected with CVA6 exhibited more perioral lesions, but both strains caused similar rates of generalized skin findings and resulted in a benign disease course. These data can infer that differentiation between CVA6 and CVA16 does not have much clinical utility. In addition, all of the patients in the Hubiche et al sample did have involvement of at least 2 of the 3 classic sites (hand, feet, and/or mouth), highlighting that even an atypical presentation will adhere to the classic distribution. Onychomadesis is a minor complication of the nail beds that has been most commonly seen after infection with CVA6 and CVA10, although reports of nail shedding after CVA5, CVA16, CVB1, and CVB3 infection have been reported.

### Recombinant human enterovirus 71 in hand, foot and mouth disease patients [^35c72bd3]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) is a common illness of infants and young children < 10 years of age. It is characterized by fever, ulcers in the oral cavity, and rashes with blisters that appear on the palm and sole. The most common causal agents of HFMD are coxsackievirus A16 (CV-A16) and human enterovirus 71 (HEV71), but other enteroviruses, including CV-A5 and CV-A10, can also cause it. When caused by CV-A16 infection, it is usually a mild disease, and patients normally recover without requiring any special medical attention.

In rare instances, the disease leads to aseptic meningitis and more serious diseases, such as encephalitis or poliomyelitis-like paralysis. HFMD caused by HEV71 has been associated with the more severe forms of the disease, including a high number of cases of fatal encephalitis during the outbreaks in Malaysia in 1997 and Taiwan in 1998. During these outbreaks, several HEV71 subgenotypes were isolated; two subgenotypes, B4 and C2, were identified as the main causal agents associated with the fatal infections. During the Malaysia 1997 outbreak, HEV71 subgenotype B3 was the most prevalent subgenotype isolated from patients with the milder form of HFMD. The B3 virus was also found in neighboring countries in 1997 and western Australia in 1999; it has since disappeared.

Case Definitions

We defined a probable HFMD patient as a patient who had rashes on the hands, feet, mouth, or buttocks and ulcers or vesicles in the mouth with or without fever. We defined a laboratory-confirmed patient as a probable patient with laboratory evidence of infection with EV-A71, CV-A16, or other enteroviruses. The diagnostic tests used for enterovirus detection were reverse transcription PCR and real-time reverse transcription PCR. Patients were classified as having severe HFMD if they had any complications (i.e. aseptic meningitis, brainstem encephalitis, encephalitis, encephalomyelitis, acute flaccid paralysis or autonomic nervous system dysregulation, pulmonary edema, pulmonary hemorrhage, or cardiorespiratory failure). Otherwise, patients were classified as having mild HFMD.

We identified patients with > 2 episodes of HFMD reported in the national HFMD surveillance system by matching records using any of the following 3 screening criteria: 1) having identical identification number and identical or highly similar patient name; 2) having identical patient's parent name, home address, and birth date and identical or highly similar patient name; and 3) having identical contact telephone number, home address, and birth date and identical or highly similar patient name (Technical Appendix). We considered patients to have recurrent HFMD if they experienced > 2 independent episodes of HFMD. We defined independent episodes as consecutive episodes separated by an interval of > 14 days if the previous episode was mild and > 23 days if the previous episode was severe. We had estimated the time intervals defining 2 independent episodes by adding the longest duration of HFMD reported (7 days for mild illness and 16 days for severe illness) plus the longest incubation period reported (7 days) (,–). We classified patients with > 2 independent episodes of laboratory-confirmed HFMD as having recurrent laboratory-confirmed HFMD. Otherwise, we classified patients as having recurrent probable HFMD. When counting the number of cases of reinfection with EV-A71, CV-A16, or other enteroviruses (Figure 1; Table 1), we considered any 2 laboratory-confirmed episodes as 1 case of reinfection; therefore, we classified patients with 3 laboratory-confirmed HFMD episodes as having 3 cases of reinfection (i.e. we grouped episodes 1 and 2, 1 and 3, and 2 and 3 together) and 4 laboratory-confirmed HFMD episodes as having 6 cases of reinfection (i.e. we grouped episodes 1 and 2, 1 and 3, 1 and 4, 2 and 3, 2 and 4, and 3 and 4 together).

### Risk factors for critical disease and death from hand, foot and mouth disease [^f06b012f]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Background

There has been a high mortality and morbidity rate of critical and fatal patients from hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) in China in recent. Causes for development of critical and fatal disease remain unclear.

Methods

We performed a case-control study to assess the association between use of drugs and development of critical disease and death from HFMD.

Results

We found that glucocorticoids treatment was associated with a greater incidence of severe HFMD, whereas andrographolides treatment was associated with a protective effect when they are used for treatment within 48 hours after onset or before being diagnosed as critical.

Conclusions

We recommend that glucocorticoids should not be used for mild HFMD and andrographolides should undergo clinical trials for treatment of enterovirus 71 infections.

Hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) is a common viral illness caused by enteroviruses that predominantly affects children aged < 5 years. In the United States, outbreaks of HFMD typically occur during summer and autumn months. The most common cause of HFMD in the United States has been enterovirus serotype coxsackievirus A16. Most infections are asymptomatic; persons with signs and symptoms typically have a mild febrile illness with rash on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet, and sores in the mouth. HFMD also has been associated, often weeks after initial symptom onset, with nail dystrophies (e.g. Beau's lines or nail shedding).

### Acute unilateral maculopathy associated with adult onset of hand, foot and mouth disease: a case report [^4cdc1fc0]. BMC Ophthalmology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) is a common and highly contagious infectious disease caused by Coxsackie viruses which belong to the Picornaviridae family of viruses. In Germany 80.000 to 140.000 cases are reported per year according to data of the Robert Koch Institut. It predominantly affects children and is characterized by fever and maculopapular or vesicular erupions on the hands, feet, and inside the mouth. Symptoms and rash normally disappear spontaneously within a week. However, systemic complications are possible such as gastrointestinal and respiratory symptoms, meningoencephalitis, and cardiac inflammation. Ocular complications such as conjunctivitis, keratoconjunctivitis, iridocyclitis, scattered hemorrhagic dots, and occlusive retinal vasculitis can rarely occur and result in temporary vision loss.

Here we report the case of a 31-year-old patient with HFMD and concurrent acute monocular maculopathy and describe multimodal imaging findings, including previously undescribed optical coherence tomography angiography (OCT-A).

### Severity and burden of hand, foot and mouth disease in Asia: a modelling study [^66e47ec7]. BMJ Global Health (2018). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) is a paediatric disease which, although usually self-limiting, can result in complications associated with the central nervous system (CNS) or death. The viruses that cause HFMD are particularly widespread in Asia, where they are responsible for millions of infections each year. An outbreak in Malaysia between April and June 1997 in which 29 children diedwas a harbinger of fatal outbreaks that have continued to recent years (170 deaths in Vietnam in 2011and 98 deaths in Cambodia in 2012). These fatal outbreaks have influenced the perceived severity of HFMD and led to the demand for control measures, such as the recent phase III vaccine trials in China, despite the limited information on the disease burden. Many affected countries, such as China, Japan and Singapore, adopted routine control measures akin to those from pandemic preparedness plans — including surveillance, mandatory reporting, isolation, school closures and social distancing — but optimal use of such interventions requires the disease burden of HFMD to be quantified so that the public health response can be calibrated accordingly.

The main aetiological agents of HFMD are the human enterovirus A71 (EV-A71) and coxsackieviruses 10 and 16, with EV-A71 being associated with more severe outcomes. As with other usually mild diseases where infections vastly exceed severe cases, efforts to track all HFMD infections to determine indices for different levels of severity are impractical due to the large number of cases involved. With the exception of a few jurisdictions, much of the data on HFMD are based on subpopulations, such as the catchment of a health system, a network of sentinel clinics or from passive surveillance using symptomatic case notifications (for instance, ref). Such studies may provide an incomplete view of the true burden of disease. Obtaining a more comprehensive picture requires synthesising available information from studies across all severity levels, from serological studies that estimate infection risk, to notification data that provide information on symptomatic cases that could be clinically identified, to hospital records that showcase the risk of more severe expressions such as CNS complications or death. Such estimates need to be constructed carefully to allow uncertainty to be properly reflected and accounted for. This can be achieved through Bayesian methods which provide a flexible framework to integrate data from multiple sources and have been used to estimate infection rates and severity indices for influenzaand HIV.

### Evaluating the transmission routes of hand, foot, and mouth disease in guangdong, China [^df0b860f]. American Journal of Infection Control (2016). Low credibility.

Although it is an enteroviral infectious disease, recent studies suggest that respiratory transmission might play a role in the transmission of hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD). We evaluated the transmission modes (respiratory and fecal-oral transmission) of HFMD among children using a case-control study in Guangdong, China. Our analyses suggested that fecal-oral transmission might be the principal transmission mode of HFMD among children in the study area, and handwashing habits of the children and their parents should be emphasized to control this infection.

### Hand-foot-and-mouth disease: rapid evidence review [^f9afb323]. American Family Physician (2019). Medium credibility.

Hand-foot-and-mouth disease is caused by human enteroviruses and coxsackieviruses. Outbreaks can occur in the spring to fall and are common in North America, and most cases occur in patients younger than 10 years. Hand-foot-and-mouth disease is transmitted by fecal-oral, oral-oral, and respiratory droplet contact. Patients present with a low-grade fever, a maculopapular or papulovesicular rash on the hands and soles of the feet, and painful oral ulcerations. Lesions usually resolve in seven to 10 days; however, in rare cases, patients may have neurologic or cardiopulmonary complications. The differential diagnosis for childhood rashes and oral enanthems is broad and includes erythema multiforme, herpes, measles, and varicella. Treatment is supportive and directed toward hydration and pain relief as needed with acetaminophen or ibuprofen. Oral lidocaine is not recommended, and antiviral treatment is not available. The best methods to prevent the spread of hand-foot-and-mouth disease are handwashing and disinfecting potentially contaminated surfaces and fomites.

Age Distribution of HFMD Cases

The age distribution of HFMD cases in Asia, compiled from a variety of sources including surveillance and cohort data, is summarized in Figure 5. Data from China. and Taiwan,– are particularly abundant. Other sources include Hong Kong, India, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam.

FIGURE 5.
HFMD cases by age and estimates of incubation period. Left: Each line indicates a unique data set (total 79 lines). Distributions within age ranges were assumed to be constant. The black dots are average proportion for that age (with 95% CI). Right: Reported incubation periods for HFMD, by year of publication and provision of evidence to support claimed period. Lines indicate that the incubation period "is X days." Gray bars indicate that the incubation period is "usually" or "typically" X days. Gray bars with lines shows an extended interval "can be up to X days." The point indicates a median. Notes: (1) provides information within the paper, which is inconsistent in this estimate; (2) uses generation interval distribution as a proxy for incubation period; (3) cites a US CDC factsheet on aseptic meningitis, which in turn provides no supporting evidence and (4) cites Goh et al.CI indicates confidence interval.

The symptomatic HFMD incidence rate varies widely even within the narrow 0- to 6-year age-band. The greatest proportion of cases occur at ages 1 [18.8% (17.4%–20.2%)] and 2 [17.9% (16.6%–19.2%)]. By the age of formal schooling, from 6 years in most Asian countries, the proportion is substantially lower [8.7% (7.9%–9.5%)]. Overall, 82.6% (82.2%–82.9%) of all cases occur before age 6. The lower rate during the first year of life could be because of lack of contact with other children or to presence of maternal antibodies.

### Severity and burden of hand, foot and mouth disease in Asia: a modelling study [^36c78189]. BMJ Global Health (2018). Medium credibility.

Despite the high incidence rate of HFMD, the relative scarcity of severe symptoms and the generally short disability durations led to estimated annual DALY losses in eight high-incidence Asian countries of only 96 900 (40 500–258 400), considerably below the disability caused by upper respiratory tract infections (603 000) but comparable to dengue (100 000 in the same countries) which has low incidence in China. However, the disability caused by HFMD is mostly associated with years of life lost (> 99%), driven by long expected remaining lifespan of children in comparison to the mild, temporary disability from acute HFMD symptoms. Overall, the years of life lost due to HFMD, 96 322 (39 911–257 613), are higher than dengue 43 762 (25 444–76 488), and upper respiratory tract infection 10 767 (8 459–13 636), because the majority of the DALY were caused by years lived with disability for the latter two diseases. These findings provide evidence to support decision-making on adoption of the EV-A71 vaccines.

The challenge in calculating the disease burden of HFMD lies in integrating and synthesising available data from decades of research into useful quantities for public health actions. In doing so, many assumptions were made. In particular, we integrated data from serological and epidemiological studies from a mixture of country-level and city-level studies across Asia to develop an overall 'Asian' average which summarises the severity across affected parts of the continent, which differ in economic development and healthcare systems. These differences cannot be easily adjusted using statistical methods due to low amounts of information from each individual country. Differences between and within countries, however, mean that these overall estimates may not apply to local decision-making. Second, the age-specific asymptomatic rate estimates were based on surveillance data from Singapore, which we believe has a notification system for symptomatic infections presenting at primary care or in education that is close to complete, but with room for misdiagnosis. Third, societal impacts — such as the indirect costs that result from caregivers taking time off work or other impacts of control policies — are not measured in our disease burden estimates, and future research should seek to quantify such indirect impacts of HFMD so that the full cost effectiveness of intervention strategies can be evaluated.

Submodel 3: hierarchical model of disease severity

For HFMD in general (ie, without reference to the specific viral agent), the symptomatic case hospitalisation ratio is estimated to be 6% (2.8%–14.9%). Among hospitalised cases, 18.7% (6.7%–31.5%) develop CNS complications, of which 5.0% (2.9%–7.4%) were fatal. Overall, the CFR for HFMD is estimated to be 52.3 (24.4–92.7) per 100 000 symptomatic infections. Among the papers which identified EV-A71 as the pathogen, the majority recruited children seeking treatment in hospitals. Of these, 36.9% (25.9%–48%) were associated with CNS complications, of which 10.5% (4.9%–17.8%) died. In contrast, there were no discernible differences in the fatality rate of HFMD patients with CNS complications between cases with EV-A71 and all HFMD infections, possibly because most severe cases were indeed caused by EV-A71. Estimates within studies and overall are presented in figure 4 and table 1, which show a summary of all estimated severity quantities of HFMD in Asia with their associated uncertainties.

Figure 4
Data and results from the hierarchical model (submodel 3). Top: hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) severity for total HFMD. Bottom: HFMD severity for lab-tested EV-A71 cases. These were modelled in two separate hierarchical pyramid models. The median and 95% credible intervals for each individual paper are shown by the black dot and lines, respectively. All estimates at the individual level are based from a hyperparameter or a higher-level parameter. The vertices of the diamond show the median (also the red line) and 95% Bayesian credible Intervals. These represent the overall estimate for each severity index, where the estimates are linked together with a multiplicative relationship: P(D|C) = P(D|S) × P(S|H) × P(H|C). All parameters were estimated using a Bayesian hierarchical approach using Markov chain Monte Carlo. Case hospitalisation ratio estimate for EV-A71 cannot be calculated as studies on EV-A71 cases are almost performed exclusively from hospital data, and thus the lowest level is 'hospitalised' and not 'cases'.

Basic Reproduction Number for HFMD by Virus

Only 3 papers have sought to estimate the reproduction number for HFMD or the viruses that cause it. One paperestimates what they call the "local effective reproduction number" in China — meaning using the average number of secondary cases from a randomly selected index to estimate the cases that would be caused in a fully susceptible population (note, this is substantially different from the effective reproduction numberin a partially susceptible population) — using a sophisticated Poisson regression model that incorporated infection from the environment, the prefecture and neighboring prefectures. This model did not, however, account for the accumulation of herd immunity and required arbitrary assignment of the infectious period, so the estimated local effective reproduction number of 1.1–1.2 during peak periods may be biased.

A second paperused a method from Choi and Pakto estimate the basic reproduction number to be 5.5 (interquartile range, 4.2–6.5) for EV-A71 and 2.5 (interquartile range, 2.0–3.7) for CV-A16. These estimates are likely inaccurate because the method assumes (i) a known generation time distribution, labeled incubation period in the paper; (ii) a completely immunonaïve population, though applied to groups of individuals for whom past exposure was highly plausible and (iii) an early exponential growth period, despite being applied to complete outbreak data.

The third paperattempted to estimate the reproduction number using a SEIQRS (Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, Quarantined, Recovered) simulation model and obtained an estimate of 1.1 for the years 2009 to 2012 in China. However, the model used 10% of China population as the initial susceptible population, but did not conduct a sensitivity analysis on this vital parameter.

### Severity and burden of hand, foot and mouth disease in Asia: a modelling study [^0b6291ba]. BMJ Global Health (2018). Medium credibility.

The EV-A71-specific incidence is a proportion of all HFMD cases. We obtain, the year effect due to EV-A71, by taking it as a binomial sample from the total year effect. The proportion of cases attributed to EV-A71 in 2008–2015, was estimated from data obtained from the National Surveillance Program in Singapore which collects clinical specimens from patients in 107 clinics and 2 hospitals, KK Women's and Children's Hospital and National University Hospital (figure 3, right). Throat or vesicle swabs were collected from patients < 12 years of age with clinical diagnosis of HFMD. Specimens were stored at room temperature or 4° (preferred) for no longer than 48 hours, before being sent to the National Public Health Laboratory for testing and typing. Data onprior to 2008 were estimated in a study by Ang et al. The average EV-A71 incidence rate by age is the average of the EV-A71 year effect, weighted by the age effect, or. The model is described in detail in online supplementary appendix B.

The black line reflects the overall proportion of incidence for each year of age, and red line represents the age effect for individual years from 2005 to 2012. Middle: the year effect. The black line is an index which reflects the number of notified cases for 2005–2012. The year effect for 2013–2015 is estimated from data (notified cases) obtained from the Weekly Infectious Disease Bulletin released by the Ministry of Health, Singapore, using linear regression. The year effect of EV-A71 (blue) is mathematically derived from the proportion of cases due to EV-A71 estimated by laboratory data (right). Right: laboratory data from Singapore's surveillance system. This shows the proportion of cases due to each virus in each year from 2005 to 2015.

### Seasonal distribution and meteorological factors associated with hand, foot, and mouth disease among children in XI' an, northwestern China [^ac114303]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) is a common infectious disease caused by enteroviruses (e.g. EV-71, Coxsackievirus 16 [CV-A16], CV-A4, CV-A6, and CV-A10) that primarily affects children younger than 5 years. Although the symptoms are usually mild (fever, skin rash on the hands and feet, and vesicles in the mouth), some rare complications can lead to cognitive and motor disorders as well as death. Therefore, this disease poses a serious threat to public health in countries with a high incidence, such as China and other Asia-Pacific countries. – China accounted for 86% of the total cases reported to the WHO between 2010 and 2014, and it reported an alarming number of approximately 2.7 million cases of HFMD, resulting in 384 deaths in 2014. Although vaccines against EV-71 for children aged 6 months to 5 years have been available since 2015, no effective vaccines for other Coxsackieviruses exist yet, and the incidence of HFMD has not decreased. Because HFMD is a major public health issue in China, ranking first among all notifiable infectious diseases and affecting more than two million children annually, it is of utmost importance to identify the risk factors of HFMD for better prevention and control of the disease.

Sex

Although most papers show that being male is a risk factor for both mild,– and severe, HFMD (OR ranges between 1.2 and 2), surprisingly, serologic evidence does not support this finding: A study from Singaporeshows marginal evidence that females are more likely to have seroconverted to EV-A71 [OR: 0.79 (0.61–1.01)], while a Taiwanesestudy shows no statistically significant differences [OR: 0.94 (0.76–1.16)]. Taken together, these suggest that infection rates are comparable, but that boys are more likely to develop symptoms, more involved in propagation of outbreaks or more likely to be brought for medical care than girls.

Other

A case–control study in Xi'an, China, found that breastfeeding may lower the risk of developing severe HFMD [adjusted OR: 0.57 (0.33–0.98)], even though breastfeeding does not apparently lower the chance of being infected by EV-A71 [OR: 1.1 (0.93–1.3)]. It further found that patients with a history of Epstein–Barr virus are at greater risk of contracting severe, rather than mild, HFMD [adjusted OR: 2.6 (1.5–4.4)]. A spatial-temporal model of Guangdongshowed that sunshine could be protective against HFMD. This is agreed by a matched case-control study of preschoolers in Beijing, which showed that UV radiation in classrooms is associated with lower HFMD attack rate (P value of 0.027), and recommended installing UV lamps to sterilize unoccupied classrooms. These findings are, however, inconsistent with the seasonal nature of HFMD, where outbreaks in temperate countries tend to occur in summer, when sunlight and UV exposure are strongest.

### Epidemic hand, foot and mouth disease caused by human enterovirus 71, Singapore [^f199c0df]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

In September and October 2000, HEV71 caused the largest HFMD epidemic recorded to date in Singapore, an epidemic that involved mainly young children < 4 years of age. Five deaths occurred, and HEV71 was isolated from four case-patients. Autopsies of four case-patients showed encephalitis, interstitial pneumonitis, and myocarditis. Virulence determinants of HEV71 and the precipitating factors for the epidemic itself unfortunately remain unknown. Based on our experiences during this epidemic, we found that an HFMD epidemic preparedness plan was useful in providing the framework for prompt actions to monitor the situation, identify the causative agent, interrupt virus transmission, and communicate with and solicit the cooperation of the media, parents, physicians, and preschool center personnel.

‡For patients with recurrence of laboratory-confirmed HFMD, the highest number of episodes was 4. For patients with recurrence of probable HFMD, the highest number of episodes was 8.

### Hand, foot, and mouth disease caused by coxsackievirus a6 [^71d8135d]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

To the Editor: Coxsackievirus A6 (CVA6) is a human enterovirus associated with herpangina in infants. In the winter of 2012, we evaluated a cluster of 8 patients, 4 months–3 years of age, who were brought for treatment at Boston Children's Hospital (Boston, MA, USA) with a variant of hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) that has now been linked to CVA6 (Table). During this same period, the Boston Public Health Commission's syndromic surveillance system detected a 3.3-fold increase in emergency department discharge diagnoses of HFMD. In the United States, HFMD typically occurs in the summer and early autumn and is characterized by a febrile enanthem of oral ulcers and macular or vesicular lesions on the palms and soles; the etiologic agents are most often CVA16 and enterovirus 71.

Data Analysis

We used medians and interquartile ranges (IQRs) to describe continuous variables and numbers and percentages to summarize categorical variables. We used logistic regression with the forward stepwise selection approach to explore the association between HFMD recurrence and severe disease. We denoted the results as odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs. All statistical tests were 2-sided, and we considered an α of 0.05 statistically significant.

We defined the probability of HFMD recurrence as the probability of occurrence of HFMD among children who previously had HFMD and estimated recurrence using survival analysis (the Kaplan-Meier method). To calculate the probability of HFMD recurrence, we took only the event of interest into account and censored other events at the end of observation. When estimating the probability of HFMD recurrence, we enrolled all patients with recurrent HFMD (whether probable or laboratory-confirmed) in the analysis. We censored patients with only 1 HFMD episode. When estimating the probability of reinfection after EV-A71 with EV-A71, we included only the case-patients with a primary episode of EV-A71 infection who were later reinfected with EV-A71. We censored case-patients who had just 1 infection with EV-A71 (i.e. case-patients who were infected with EV-A71 then infected with CV-A16 or other enteroviruses, case-patients who were infected with EV-A71 then had probable HFMD, and case-patients with a single episode of EV-A71 infection). We used similar analyses to estimate the probability of reinfection with the same serotype for other serotypes of enterovirus.

We also conducted a sensitivity analysis to account for the uncertainty of the intervals used to define 2 independent HFMD episodes; in this analysis, we used 16 days (for previous mild episodes) and 61 days (for previous severe episodes) as cutoff values, which were derived from another investigation conducted in China that also investigated HFMD recurrence. We conducted data cleaning and analyses using R Project version 3.2.5 and ArcGIS 10.2. This study was approved by the ethics review committees of China CDC (Beijing, China).

### The epidemiology of hand, foot and mouth disease in Asia: a systematic review and analysis [^02cfa8a3]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2016). Low credibility.

A recently developed EV-A71 vaccine has undergone phase 3 trials in China. – To determine the cost-effectiveness of incorporating the vaccine in pediatric vaccination schedules, or of other interventions such as school closure or isolation, would require epidemiologic models that account for the protective effects of herd immunity. However, this review indicates that vital parameters for such models remain unknown. The asymptomatic rate and relative infectiousness of asymptomatic cases are both poorly known, while estimates of the incubation period, although commonly cited as 3–5 days, appear to be based solely on expert opinion. Most importantly, estimates of the basic reproduction number range widely from 1.1 to 5.5. This uncertainty prohibits utilitarian estimation of the necessary vaccine coverage to prevent epidemics of EV-A71.

To reconcile the differences between the disparate estimates, the age distributions of the samples need to be considered. As shown in this review, symptomatic HFMD incidence rate differ greatly even between ages 0 and 6, and thus, studies conducted predominantly on preschoolers may derive higher estimates of R 0 compared with studies in older children. Accordingly, future studies on HFMD should use narrower age bands and also state the distribution clearly to allow adjustments or standardization.

Two final omissions from the literature are quantitative estimates of the impact of infection on complications, child and caregiver absenteeism and costings of complications, and qualitative evidence on the impact of infection and enforced isolation on families and schools. Given the promising direct effects of the EV-A71 vaccine and the huge public health impacts of HFMD in East and Southeast Asia, research is urgently needed to fill these gaps.

The research questions in this systematic review were generally answered only by a limited number of papers, with substantial differences in their study design, and thus, most data were not synthesized through meta-analysis. More research to assess risk factors and measure key epidemiologic parameters is needed. We were also unable to trace the earliest cases of HFMD in Asia as our scope only covers published material on outbreaks, which leads us back to 1967 in Japan. Finally, we limited the scope of this study to exclude virologic characteristics or molecular epidemiology, which have been well reviewed elsewhere,– and clinical manifestations of EV-A71 and CV-A16. A recent review of the case-fatality rate has recently been published, as has a review of the epidemiology in Taiwan.

Risk Factors

Risk factors for infection are depicted in Figure 4 (Appendix 2) and summarized below.

FIGURE 4.
Excerpts from studies on risk factors. Ruan et al case-control study in Qiaosi, China, was conducted by taking 273 diagnosed HFMD/herpangina as cases (6 years of age or younger) and 273 stratified random sample as controls. Park et al case-control study uses hospital cases of enteroviral aseptic meningitis (n = 205) and HFMD (n = 116), and nonenteroviral disease controls (n = 170). Their case-crossover design uses only cases. 1–7 days before admission was set as the hazard period, and 22–28 days prior to admission was set as the nonhazard period. Both studies gather data via questionnaires. White points indicate nonadjusted ORs, black points indicate adjusted OR. For the effect of sex (bottom right), confidence intervals are omitted from complete case notifications, and colored gray and white alternately for visual distinction.

Hygiene

Evidence from Qiaosi, China, indicates the importance of hygiene for protection against HFMD infection. Children who always wash their hands before meals are about 50 times less likely to contract HFMD, while those whose caregivers wash their hands before feeding are about 25 times less likely. Additional protective habits include washing of hands after play, washing of hands more than 4 times per day, using soap, and not sucking fingers.

A study in Korearevealed that drinking unboiled water [odds ratio (OR): 3.34 (1.59–6.99)], a change in water quality such as color, taste, smell, presence of precipitation or floating materials [OR: 6.93 (2.17–22.15)], using communal toilets/toilets outside the house [OR: 2.77 (1.14–6.74)] and eating outside the home [OR: 37.0 (5.1–269.5)] were risk factors for HFMD.

Rural Versus Urban Areas

All papers,– that compared urban with rural areas agreed that the latter conferred a higher risk for HFMD. However, this might be confounded by socioeconomic status and hygiene practices.

### Enterovirus 71 related severe hand, foot and mouth disease outbreaks in south-east Asia: current situation and ongoing challenges [^7b9bf944]. Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health (2014). Low credibility.

Chinese surveillance data from 2008 to 2012 of over seven million children with HFMD identified the highest incidence to be in children aged 12–23 months. Children aged less than 6 months had the highest risk for severe and fatal disease, with the risk declining with increasing age. Of the 1.1% that had neurological or cardiopulmonary complications, 3% died. Overall, the case-fatality rate was 0.03% (n = 2457), and 93% of the laboratory-confirmed deaths (n = 1737) were associated with EV71. In contrast, worldwide 385, 71 and 79 patients died from influenza virus A/H5N1, A/H7N9 and Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus, respectively, between 1997 and 2103. Feeding difficulties, ventilator dependence due to central hypoventilation and persistent limb weakness have been reported as sequelae following severe disease. Attention deficit hyperactivity in school-aged children, and speech delay in children under 2 years have been reported among milder cases. However the long-term effects on the large numbers of children affected by these outbreaks remain unknown.

Hand-foot-and-mouth disease (HFMD) is a common self-limited viral illness seen in the United States and around the world. Its classic features are easily recognizable; however, nail changes are not well known or characterized. This case demonstrates onychomadesis and Beau lines in a child following clinical diagnosis of hand-foot-and-mouth disease. In this setting, nail dystrophies should be reassuring to pediatricians and families.

### The effect of school closure on hand, foot, and mouth disease transmission in Singapore: a modeling approach [^22df2759]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) is a common pediatric disease that is endemic in East and Southeast Asia, and increasingly found in North America, and Europe. When caused by Coxsackieviruses, HFMD usually leads to relatively mild infections with symptoms that are self-limiting. However, HFMD caused by human enterovirus 71 may lead to complications involving the nervous system and result in reduced cognitive function, delayed neurodevelopment, and motor impairment, or death –; in China, an estimated 350–900 children die of HFMD annually.

Because of this potential severity, the Ministry of Health in Singapore imposes strict control policies, especially in preschools. In preschools, daily routine health checks for all children and isolation of suspected cases are implemented for early detection and control of outbreaks. Should transmission continue within an outbreak, school closure is enforced. This policy was implemented following an outbreak in 2000 in which several children died from enterovirus 71 complications; the details have evolved over time, but until recently, if a school has more than 16 cases or an attack rate more than 23% with a transmission period more than 24 days, the school will be required to close for a period of 10 days. In the most updated guideline, the policy has been relaxed somewhat, and Ministry of Health will consider the predominant circulating strain when assessing closure in addition to the trigger. This change provides an avenue to assess the impact of this policy.

### Epidemic hand, foot and mouth disease caused by human enterovirus 71, Singapore [^170ddcd3]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

Singapore experienced a large epidemic of hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) in 2000. After reviewing HFMD notifications from doctors and child-care centers, we found that the incidence of HFMD rose in September and declined at the end of October. During this period, 3,790 cases were reported. We performed enteroviral cultures on 311 and 157 specimens from 175 HFMD patients and 107 non-HFMD patients, respectively; human enterovirus 71 (HEV71) was the most frequently isolated virus from both groups. Most of the HFMD patients were ≤ 4 years of age. Three HFMD and two non-HFMD patients died. Specimens from two HFMD and both non-HFMD patients were culture positive for HEV71; a third patient was possibly associated with the virus. Autopsies performed on all three HFMD and one of the non-HFMD case-patients showed encephalitis, interstitial pneumonitis, and myocarditis. A preparedness plan for severe HFMD outbreaks provided for the prompt, coordinated actions needed to control the epidemic.

### The epidemiology of hand, foot and mouth disease in Asia: a systematic review and analysis [^0955fcca]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2016). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

Despite the substantial number of papers on HFMD, this systematic review shows that many fundamental questions about EV-A71 and CV-A16 persist. Both viruses occur year round in tropical Asia, but are epidemic in the summer in Northeast Asia. A role for temperature or humidity therefore seems plausible,– although given the relative lack of seasonality in equatorial Asia, it is not clear whether prediction of outbreaks is possible there. In Japan, summer temperatures peak after HFMD incidence does, suggesting correlation but not temporality, and that it may not be possible to provide early warning of impending epidemics. This also differs from other human enteric viruses including poliovirus 1 (also an enterovirus), hepatitis A and adenovirus that have been shown to survive longer on colder surfaces.

Urashima et alclaimed that enteroviruses experience a more rapid virus decline during dry seasons than during wet seasons, which could explain the seasonality. This result is supported by Wang et al, where they showed that precipitation patterns has the most similar structure as HFMD incidence, more so than other meteorologic variables, albeit with only 11 months of data.

While any causal relationship between climate and HFMD is unknown, speculations include a lower HFMD incidence because of decreased social contact during temperate zones' winter. In contrast, increased social contacts during winter have been speculated to facilitate spread of other droplet-borne diseases, such as influenza, which are epidemic in winter. Given the unknowns surrounding this issue, further research is clearly required to ascertain whether meteorologic factors or seasonal social contact patterns is an adequate explanation for the seasonality of HFMD.

The next step to analyzing the dynamics of HFMD seasonality is likely to involve social and environmental factors, another under-researched area for this pediatric disease. For instance, the literature is unclear on the relative importance of school versus community transmission, with evidence to support both, yet knowledge of where HFMD most often is transmitted is important as school closure policies are employed to control outbreaks in some countries. Further, the environment of schools in Asia may vary widely, and attributes such as hygiene practices should be characterized and quantified to allow more definitive results and conclusions in future studies.

### Prevalence and management of severe hand, foot, and mouth disease in xiangyang, China from 2008–2013 [^9d6c5958]. Journal of Medical Virology (2020). Medium credibility.

Therapeutic strategies for severe hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) are currently either inconsequent or deficient in evidence. We retrospectively surveyed HFMD outbreaks in Xiangyang from June 2008 to December 2013. HFMD is staged form I to V according to clinical severity and the case with central nervous system involvement is defined as a severe one. We analyzed risk factors for fatality of severe cases and compared the efficiency and outcome of some therapies by binary logistic regression. The overall HFMD cases included 637 (1.26%) severe cases, 38 fatalities (0.75‰). Analysis indicates that age (< 3 y), enterovirus 71 (+), autonomic nervous system dysregulation, pulmonary edema/hemorrhage, CRP (> 40 mg/L) and cardiac troponin I (> 0.04 ng/mL) are risk factors for fatality (all P < 0.05). Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and mechanical ventilation applied only in early stage IV significantly improved HFMD progression (both P < 0.05) with odds ratios of 0.24 (95% CI: 0.10–0.57) and 0.01 (95% CI: 0.00–0.10), respectively. Neither methylprednisolone nor milrinone administered in any stage made any significant difference on mortality (all P > 0.05). Precise recognition of the severe HFMD cases in early stage IV and prompt IVIG and mechanical ventilation application may decrease mortality. Mechanical ventilation training programs and dispatching specialists to county-level or district hospitals when there is no chance of transfer critical HFMD cases to a superior hospital are two key successful administrative initiatives.

### Neonatal hand, foot, and mouth disease due to coxsackievirus A6 in shanghai [^b742bf27]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

HFMD can be transmitted both horizontally (faecal-oral/respiratory route) and vertically (prenatal infection). Most new-borns presenting with serious EV disease acquire the infection from a symptomatic mother in the perinatal period; up to 60% of the mothers of infected infants report febrile illness during the last week of pregnancy. Additionally, serious EV disease may be acquired through nosocomial transmission, spreading throughout nurseries via caregivers engaged in mouth care, gavage feeding, and other activities requiring direct contact. Close contact with infected family members may be also an important route of transmission.

In this prospective cohort study, the neonates with HFMD and their families were recruited in Shanghai in 2016–2017, and the epidemiological features, clinical presentation, pathogens, genes, and immune function were compared in neonates with HFMD and their diseased siblings.

### The epidemiology of hand, foot and mouth disease in Asia: a systematic review and analysis [^e7e52adc]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Even without being able to determine the relative importance of school versus community transmission, the effectiveness of school closure to prevent large-scale HFMD outbreaks is questionable, as the interruption to social networks cannot be enforced while children are out of school. Additionally, although we know little about the infectiousness of asymptomatic cases of HFMD, the proportion of infections that are asymptomatic is substantial, and so even quite modest school closure attack rate thresholds, such as Singapore's 25%, corresponds to a possible majority of students being infected before the trigger for closure being met. Further, EV-A71 can be found in fecal samples for up to 54 days after infection, and thus continue to be shed after a school is closed, disinfected and reopened.

Studies on risk factors were rare, and we identified only 3 papers that describe risk factors for hygiene and contact patterns, making a meta-analysis of risk factors unfeasible. These typically were only powered to provide unadjusted effect sizes, and so provide evidence of correlation, not causation. One interesting finding was the apparent protective effect of a caregiver "always washing" their hands. This suggests that adult to child transmission might be important, even if adults are mostly asymptomatic with EV-A71 and CV-A16, but may reflect confounding with general hygiene. Future work may elicit hygiene factors at the preschool level and relate these to attack rates.

### Seasonal distribution and meteorological factors associated with hand, foot, and mouth disease among children in XI' an, northwestern China [^cd5c59e8]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Medium credibility.

Previous studies have found a negative linear relationship between monthly precipitation and HFMD in eastern central China and Vietnam, which is different from the inverted-U pattern relationship observed in Xi'an. – The positive association between precipitation and HFMD may be due to the moisture content in the surface soil or water, which mimics the water content in human feces, thus enabling and activating the virus and affecting the activity and transmission of the enteroviruses so that they are more contagious and survive longer. On the other hand, the negative association between precipitation and HFMD could be explained by the fact that because of excessive precipitation, children spend less time participating in outdoor activities and have a decreased risk of coming into contact with enteroviruses. Thus, the incidence of HFMD decreases with increasing precipitation.

Over the past few decades, HFMD has emerged as a serious public health threat worldwide because of its high incidence and severe complications. Although the incidence of HFMD in Xi'an is high and has shown a slowly increasing trend, the case fatality rate (CFR) of this disease has declined and is significantly lower than the national average level. The increased incidence and decreased CFR may reflect the improvements in disease reporting and surveillance, suggesting that HFMD cases have been reported in a timely and accurate manner, subsequently leading to timely and effective treatment. Although the incidence of HFMD in Xi'an has not decreased after the widespread use of the EV-71 vaccine since 2017, the number of severe HFMD cases due to EV-71 infection has decreased dramatically, which is a good sign. However, high and inapparent infection rates of HFMD have been observed mainly among children younger than 4 years, peaking between April and June in Xi'an, suggesting that preventative measures should be installed for high-risk children in addition to vaccination before the epidemic seasons every year.

### Coxsackievirus A6-related hand foot and mouth disease: skin manifestations in a cluster of adult patients [^7e895065]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Hand foot and mouth disease (HFMD) is a common childhood manifestation of enterovirus (EV) infection. It predominantly affects young children, and has been mainly associated with coxsackievirus (CV) A16 and EV 71.

Objectives

We report an unusual cluster of adult patients with HFMD.

Study Design

Throat swabs and vesicular fluid samples obtained from patients admitted to the emergency room (ER) with HFMD were tested for EV by reverse transcription (RT)-real time PCR, and further subjected to sequencing and phylogenetic analysis.

Results

CVA6 was identified as the causative agent of HFMD in five epidemiologically-unrelated adult patients (28–37 years old) admitted to the ER between December 2012 and February 2013. Phylogenetic analysis mapped the CVA6 strains into one cluster. All patients manifested with fever and a severe vasculitis-like rash, followed by spontaneous recovery.

Conclusions

This cluster identifies CVA6 as an emerging cause of HFMD of unusual age distribution, seasonality, and clinical severity, underscoring the need for continued alertness and clinical-genotypic surveillance of EV HFMD.

### Emerging coxsackievirus A6 causing hand, foot and mouth disease, Vietnam [^ee206a4a]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) is a major public health issue in Asia and has global pandemic potential. Coxsackievirus A6 (CV-A6) was detected in 514/2,230 (23%) of HFMD patients admitted to 3 major hospitals in southern Vietnam during 2011–2015. Of these patients, 93 (18%) had severe HFMD. Phylogenetic analysis of 98 genome sequences revealed they belonged to cluster A and had been circulating in Vietnam for 2 years before emergence. CV-A6 movement among localities within Vietnam occurred frequently, whereas viral movement across international borders appeared rare. Skyline plots identified fluctuations in the relative genetic diversity of CV-A6 corresponding to large CV-A6-associated HFMD outbreaks worldwide. These data show that CV-A6 is an emerging pathogen and emphasize the necessity of active surveillance and understanding the mechanisms that shape the pathogen evolution and emergence, which is essential for development and implementation of intervention strategies.

### Hand, foot, and mouth disease outbreak by coxsackievirus A6 during COVID-19 pandemic in 2021, S ã o paulo, Brazil [^1acc2e99]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) is an acute febrile illness characterized by fever; sore throat; and vesicular eruptions on the hands, feet, and oral mucosa. Outbreaks of HFMD in children aged < 5 years have been reported worldwide and the major causative agents are Coxsackievirus (CV)A16, enterovirus (EV)-A71 and recently CVA6.

Aim and Methods

The aim of this study was to investigated a large outbreak of Hand, foot, and mouth disease during COVID-19 pandemic in 2021 from clinical samples of 315 suspected cases, in São Paulo State, Brazil. Diagnostic evaluation was performed by RT-qPCR, culture cell isolation and serological neutralization assay. EV-positive were genotyped by partial VP1 genome sequencing.

Results

One hundred and forty-nine cases analyzed were positive for enterovirus (47.3%; n = 149/315) by neutralizing test (n = 10 patients) and RT-qPCR (n = 139 patients), and identified as CVA6 sub-lineage D3 by analysis of VP1 partial sequences.

Conclusions

This finding indicated the reemergence of CVA6 in HFMD, soon after the gradual easing of non-pharmaceutical interventions during-pandemic COVID-19 and the relevance of continued surveillance of circulating enterovirus types in the post-COVID pandemic era.

### Sudden secondary sensorineural hearing loss following hand, foot, and mouth disease in an adult patient: a case report [^72472ed0]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction: Sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL) can present as sudden hearing loss within 72 hours. Studies have shown that viral infection, including direct invasion, indirect reactions, stress responses, and immune-mediated hearing loss, is the main cause of SSNHL. Viral infection may play an important role in SSNHL by causing injury to the inner ear through blood or cerebrospinal fluid. In this article, we describe an adult case of SSNHL following hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD). Case Report: A 34-year-old man presented with sudden hearing loss in the right ear 4 days after HFMD onset. Tinnitus, ear fullness, and a slightly heavy head appeared synchronously as accompanying symptoms. Before 6 days, he had a fever for 2 days (the highest temperature was 39.4°C), followed by vesicles in the oral mucosa and papules on the hands and feet after cohabitation with his child diagnosed with HFMD.

### Epidemiology of recurrent hand, foot and mouth disease, China, 2008–2015 [^4289092f]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Three monovalent EV-A71 vaccines are administered in China. Our study indicates that children who receive an EV-A71 vaccine can still develop HFMD after vaccination, which is a challenge for monovalent EV-A71 vaccines. Even though the EV-A71 vaccine protects against > 90% of the EV-A71 infections that occur in children, children still face the risk for infection with other enterovirus serotypes after vaccination. Hence, public health authorities should inform parents and caregivers about the risk for the development of HFMD after EV-A71 vaccination, and multivalent vaccines for HFMD (e.g. EV-A71 combined with other prevalent circulating serotypes CV-A16 and CV-A6) are needed for the HFMD epidemic.

This study has several limitations. First, the burden of HFMD recurrence was underestimated because the disease is substantially underreported in the surveillance system (16%–36% estimated) and the observation period for assessing recurrence was insufficient, especially among patients identified in more recent years. Although the recurrence of HFMD is rarely reported in other countries, our study suggests that it is not uncommon. Second, because clinical samples were not collected from all patients during each HFMD episode and tested, we could not determine the real number of recurrent HFMD cases; thus, the probabilities of reinfection with an identical enterovirus serotype (i.e. EV-A71 and CV-A16) we calculated might be underestimated. It is not favorable to estimate the number of patients with reinfections of the same serotype because only a small proportion (4.2%) of HFMD episodes have been tested for enterovirus diagnosis, although mathematical modeling methods could be used to solve this problem. This topic requires further exploration. Third, we were unable to describe the features of patients with reinfection of non–EV-A71 and non–CV-A16 serotypes. Fourth, the short interval between consecutive episodes in some patients suggests the potential for co-infections rather than reinfections; thus, co-infections might have occurred and caused a slight overestimation of the recurrence rate for HFMD. However, patients with short intervals between consecutive episodes accounted for a small proportion of the patients with recurrent HFMD, so the effect that co-infections played is relatively limited.

### The population-based health effect of hand, foot and mouth disease in children in shanghai [^ea436cfc]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Background

An effective enterovirus 71 (EV71) vaccine is needed to control the annual outbreaks of hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) in China. Adequate epidemiologic data relating to HFMD are needed to make decisions about appropriate public health interventions and implementation of the new EV71 vaccine.

Methods

We analyzed the population-based epidemiologic characteristics, clinical outcome and laboratory investigation of the 2011 HFMD outbreak in children based on the citywide surveillance system in Shanghai.

Results

The incidence rate of HFMD was 25.8 per 1000 in children < 10 years of age in Shanghai in 2011, ranging from 2.5 per 1000 in the age group 7 to 9.9 years to 48.4 per 1000 in the age group 3 to 3.9 years. Children 1 to 1.9 years were at the highest risk of developing severe complications and most susceptible to HFMD. Boys and migrant children had significantly increased risks of contracting HFMD and developing severe disease. More institutional clusters/outbreaks occurred in the winter peak months than in the summer peak months. Migrant young children played a central role in the spread of HFMD in the community. EV71 was identified in 39.7% of mild HFMD outpatients, 47.4% of hospitalized patients, 92.1% of severe inpatients with complications, 50% of outbreaks and 38.8% of clusters in institutions.

Conclusion

HFMD and EV71 infections have a significant health effect on Shanghai children.

### Risk factors for hand, foot, and mouth disease and herpangina and the preventive effect of hand-washing [^c14c1a09]. Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Hygiene and social distancing are recommended control measures for hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) and herpangina. However, empirical data to support this recommendation are limited.

Methods

During an outbreak of HFMD and herpangina due to infection by the human enterovirus 71, we defined a case as a vesicular papular rash on the hands, feet, buttocks, or oral mucosa and onset from April 30 to June 26, 2008. We selected 176 HFMD and herpangina case-children and a stratified random sample of 201 asymptomatic control-children; frequency matched according to residency status. We administered a questionnaire to the parents about their children's exposures and hygienic behaviors.

Results

Risk factors for HFMD and herpangina included playing with neighborhood children (odds ratio [OR]: 11 [95% confidence interval (CI): 6.2–17]), visiting an outpatient clinic for another reason ≤ 1 week before onset (OR: 20 [95% CI: 5.0–88]), and community exposures to crowded places (OR: 7.3 [95% CI: 4.1–13]). By using a score summarizing responses to 4 hand-washing questions, we found that 50% of the case-children and 2.5% of control-children had a poor score of 1 to 3, whereas 12% of the case-children and 78% of control-children had a good score of ≥ 7 (OR: 0.00069 [95% CI: 0.0022–0.022]) after we adjusted for residency, age, and community exposures by using logistic regression.

Conclusions

Hand-washing by preschool-aged children and their caregivers had a significant protective effect against community-acquired HFMD and herpangina from the human enterovirus 71 infection.

The atypical seasonality of the outbreak, during the winter in Boston, could be related to the unusually mild temperatures in the winter of 2012.

Recent CVA6 outbreaks have been characterized by a febrile illness associated with an oral enanthem and lesions on the palms, soles, and buttocks. CVA6 infections in Taiwan during 2004–2009 were associated with HFMD in 13% of cases, with disease defined as oral ulcers on the tongue or buccal mucosa and vesicular rashes on the palms, soles, knees, or buttocks. In Singapore, where CVA6 accounted for 24% of HFMD cases, patients had oral lesions and < 5 peripheral papules, placing them on a spectrum closer to the herpangina more typically observed in CVA6 infection.

### Enterovirus 71 related severe hand, foot and mouth disease outbreaks in south-east Asia: current situation and ongoing challenges [^ae5805cc]. Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health (2014). Low credibility.

Challenges

As yet, EV71 HFMD outbreaks have not spread beyond South-East Asia. It is important to monitor and study this disease and pathogen to evaluate future risk. The role of host genetics and the duration and efficacy of cross protection provided by past infections with any of the closely related human EVs will need to be assessed to evaluate pandemic potential. Vaccine development has progressed but routine use is still distant. Monitoring viral genetic and antigenic evolution, cross protection and waning of immunity will inform vaccine development and implementation. Public health interventions should be based on understanding transmission chains of EVs, and the duration of viral shedding. There is an urgent need to identify early clinical predictors of severe disease. Countries currently affected typically have frail health infrastructures which can easily be overburdened by outbreaks. Costly interventions already implemented have not been clearly evaluated. Severe HFMD occurs at a time of rapid brain development. Concerns over long-tem outcomes have not been prospectively evaluated. If long-term sequelae are present, the economic and social burden of the disease may be higher than that seen during the acute illness.

These challenges are immense. A first step is to establish regional clinical and laboratory networks. This is crucial to harmonise diagnosis, treatment and management protocols across countries and monitor the evolutionary biology of EV71.

Improved evidence-based management of outbreaks in affected regions is essential preparation for potential outbreaks in novel regions. Multicentre intervention trials allow implementation of successful interventions in several countries at once. Studies are underway in Vietnam to assess the efficacy of magnesium sulfate as a therapeutic intervention, to identify genetic and antigenic evolution of the virus, to look at host genetic factors associated with severe disease, and to evaluate clinical predictors of disease progression and neurodevelopmental complications of severe disease. EV71 and HFMD will continue to be a serious public health issue in South-East Asia.

### Workshop on use of intravenous immunoglobulin in hand, foot and mouth disease in southeast Asia [^f58d41fb]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Outbreaks of EV71 in Asia

Currently, EV71-associated HFMD is endemic in large parts of Southeast Asia. Large outbreaks have occurred in Taiwan in 1998 (≈1,500,000 cases and 78 deaths); in China in 2008 and 2009 (490,000 and 1,150,000 cases and 127 and 353 deaths, respectively); in Vietnam in 2011–2012 (260,000 cases and 211 deaths); and in Cambodia in 2012 (unknown total number of cases and > 54 deaths). In the Taiwan outbreak, EV71 was isolated in 49% of patients with uncomplicated infection, in 75% of hospitalized patients, and in 92% of the 78 patients who died; this evidence suggests that EV71 is strongly associated with severe illness and death. A 2–3-year EV71 outbreak pattern has been described in Japan, Taiwan, Malaysia, and provinces of China, with seasons of less severe HFMD caused by the other enterovirus A types between the EV71 peak years. This pattern is assumed to relate to the presence of birth cohorts of children who have not been exposed to the virus of a size that is large enough to sustain human-to-human transmission. Coxsackievirus A6 and A10 have been dominant in the region recently.

### Pseudomembranous conjunctivitis with hand, foot and mouth disease in a pregnant woman: a case report [^82f11337]. BMC Ophthalmology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) is a common and highly contagious infectious disease caused by an enterovirus, generally Coxsackie A16. However, other serotypes have also been described, such as Enterovirus 71. HFMD predominantly affects children and immunocompromised adults and is rarely prevalent in immunocompetent adults. It is characterized by mild fever and maculopapular or vesicular eruptions on the extremities and genitalia as well as ulceration of the mouth, palate, and pharynx. Symptoms usually disappear spontaneously within a week. Systemic complications, including respiratory issues, meningoencephalitis, and pericarditis, can also rarely occur.

Although ocular involvement is rare, uveoretinitis, outer retinitis, exudative maculopathy, and occlusive retinal vasculitis have been described. However, there are few reports of pseudomembranous conjunctivitis. Brown reports the case of a 9-year-old child with HFMD who had an ulcerated phlyctenule. However, cases of conjunctivitis in adults are rare, and no clinical progress has been reported.

We report the case of a 37-year-old female who was 28 weeks pregnant that was diagnosed with HFMD and concurrent acute pseudomembranous conjunctivitis. Herein, we report the clinical course of this patient, who received topical and systemic treatment.

### Hand, foot, and mouth disease outbreak and coxsackievirus A6, Northern Spain, 2011 [^68a0b71b]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

To the Editor: Hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) is an acute, febrile viral infection characterized by vesicular exanthema on the palms of the hands, soles of the feet, and oral mucosa. The infection is transmitted through oral and respiratory secretions, vesicular fluid, and/or feces of affected persons. The most common etiologic agents are coxsackievirus (CV) A16 and human enterovirus (HEV) 71, but other HEVs, mainly belonging to species A, have also been associated with illness. HFMD mainly affects infants and children < 5 years of age.

On May 10, 2011, an outbreak of HFMD was reported in a daycare center in the city of Irun in Basque Country, Spain. Monitoring subsequently was conducted for HFMD cases among children in the health district that contained the daycare center (a total of 4,540 children < 14 years of age). Children with fever and vesicular rash on the palms and/or soles and in the mouth were considered HFMD patients. Pharyngeal and/or dermal exudate and/or feces were collected for virologic confirmation from 37 representative HFMD patients (17 with multiple specimens) selected by sentinel pediatricians in outpatient clinics. Viral RNA was extracted directly from specimens (NucliSENS Easy-Mag, Bio-Mèrieux, Marcy-l'Étoile, France) and was used in the amplification methods. Enterovirus RNA was detected by an in-house real-time PCR that amplified a fragment within the 5′ untranslated region by using described primers. For genotyping, the viral protein 1 gene was amplified by using described methods, followed by partial sequencing of the obtained amplicons by using the 3130XL Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Control measures recommended were frequent and careful handwashing with soap and running water by children and staff and increasing the cleaning of surfaces and objects in daycare centers and nursery schools.

### Elevated antigen-specific Th2 type response is associated with the poor prognosis of hand, foot and mouth disease [^69b614ab]. Virus Research (2013). Low credibility.

The immunopathogenesis of severe hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) remains elusive. This study revealed that enterovirus 71 (EV71) epitope-specific CD4+ T cell responses of HFMD patients were skewed toward a Th2 cytokine profile. Patients that demonstrated higher levels of IL-4 expression in their CD4 T cells following antigen stimulation in vitro tended to have a more prolonged period of high fevers and a longer duration of illness. Thus, an increase of EV71 epitope-specific Th2 type response may portend the poor prognosis for some HFMD patients.

### Emerging coxsackievirus A6 causing hand, foot and mouth disease, Vietnam [^2cb260a7]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

We report the evolutionary process of CV-A6 in Vietnam during 2011–2015. In addition, we summarize its detection rate in HFMD patients and associated demographics and clinical outcomes. Of 510 patients with CV-A6 infection, 93 (18%) had severe HFMD (grade 2b1 or above). However, 18% should not be interpreted as the proportion of CV-A6 infections associated with severe disease because most severe cases (76/93 [82%]; Table) came from the first phase of the study, during which only patients with severe HFMD were enrolled. However, when patients with all severities of HFMD were enrolled in the second phase of the study, CV-A6–associated severe HFMD accounted for 4% (17/434; Table) of the total number of CV-A6 patients. This result is in accordance with previous reports showing that HFMD is a mild disease with sporadic severe cases and demonstrates the potential association of CV-A6 with severe HFMD.

Our analysis placed the Vietnam CV-A6 strains within cluster A of CV-A6. This cluster A includes viruses sampled from various countries worldwide, and has emerged only recently: in Finland in 2008, followed by France, the United Kingdom, and subsequently the United States and countries in Asia in subsequent years. Although this migration highlights the global dispersal of cluster A viruses, and their potential to cause outbreaks worldwide, phylogeographic analysis of global strains did not reveal a high frequency of CV-A6 movement between endemic countries. In contrast, viral transmission between geographic locations within southern Vietnam appeared frequently; Ho Chi Minh City is a likely source of viral circulation given the observed phylogeographic patterns, and transmission is highly connected with other endemic countries in the region and southern provinces in Vietnam through international and domestic transport. This observation is in agreement with previously observed patterns of EV-A71 transmission within and between endemic countries.

### The epidemiology of hand, foot and mouth disease in Asia: a systematic review and analysis [^77663e26]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2016). Low credibility.

The earliest recorded cases of HFMD in Asia are from Japan (1967), Singapore (1970), Taiwan (1980)and Shanghai, China (1981). Since then, outbreaks have been reported in many parts of Asia, including mainland China. 52 Korea, – Japan, – Taiwan,– Hong Kong, India, – Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia,– Singapore, and Brunei, as summarized in Figure 3. These reported outbreaks are unlikely to reflect the true first outbreaks of HFMD, as serologic studies provide evidence that by the time surveillance systems were established, EV-A71 and CV-A16 were already endemic in many of these countries. Early serologic tests conducted in Japan in 1970 show evidence of EV-A71 and CV-A16 circulation. Serum taken in the late 1990s in Singapore, before the start of surveillance in 2000, shows that around 50% children and 44% cord blood, indicating maternal infection, had already seroconverted to EV-A71. Blood samples from Taiwan (1989–1997) show 3%–11% EV-A71 incidence per year, and up to 68% of childrenhad serologic evidence of EV-A71 infection before the large HFMD outbreak of 1997. Similarly, although China has reported millions of HFMD cases since the beginning of the HFMD surveillance program in 2008, evidence from Anhuishows high seroprevalence of up to 74.6% in older children before the 2008 outbreaks. Retrospective seroepidemiologic tests from blood serum collected in 2005also show that China had positive rates of 32.0% to EV-A71 and 43.4% to CV-A16, indicating that outbreaks happened earlier but were simply not reported in the literature.

### Epidemic hand, foot and mouth disease caused by human enterovirus 71, Singapore [^a34105d4]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

Coinfection with a second virus has been suggested as yet another possible pathogenetic factor, and this theory is supported by the concomitant isolation of a subgenus B adenovirus with an enterovirus from three persons who died during a HFMD outbreak in Sarawak. Among the Singaporean patients with HEV71 infection, three had a second virus isolated concurrently. However, the presence of dual viruses did not result in severe disease, although a child with HEV71 and CAV16 coinfection died in Singapore in 1997.

We considered whether any unusual medications, treatments, or dietary exposures contributed to the deaths. No evidence from the fatalities in Singapore suggests this possibility. Conversely, we reviewed whether any particular therapeutic modality improved clinical outcome, but found that this idea cannot be argued conclusively because the HFMD patient with aseptic meningitis recovered well with symptomatic treatment. The child who survived his two younger siblings had no complications from HFMD and was not cared for differently from his siblings before hospitalization. He was given prophylactic intravenous immunoglobulin solely because his siblings died. Whether this treatment, which was not administered to the patients who died, helped prevent severe disease in him is uncertain.

Considering that transmission of enteroviruses is mainly fecal-oral and through the respiratory route (to some extent), we note that spread of the viruses is prevalent in child-care centers. To break the chain of transmission during the epidemic, the HFMD Task Force coordinated a swift, nationwide closure of preschool centers on October 1, 2000, reopening them on October 16, 2000, only when the HFMD reports recorded a declining trend, and no additional severe cases and deaths associated with the disease were reported. Other measures included repeated public health education through the mass media on observance of good personal hygiene, cleaning and disinfection of premises and articles both at home and at preschool centers, and keeping children away from crowds. These interventions may have played a role in bringing the epidemic under control by the end of October, although the outbreak may have also run its natural course by that time.

### Epidemiological and genetic characterizations of hand, foot, and mouth disease and acute respiratory infections due to CV-A6 infection in henan province, China between 2021 and 2022 [^2155944f]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) is a common infectious disease in children, characterized by the appearance of rash on the hands, feet and mouth, and mainly affects young children under the age of five. The disease is self-limiting and its severity varies among individuals, with complications such as meningitis, myocarditis, and pulmonary edema occurring in a small number of patients. Human enteroviruses are the main pathogens of HFMD, of which the most common enteroviruses are coxsackievirus (CV) A16 and enterovirus (EV) A71. However, after 2016, the number of EV-A71 cases declined year by year, and even tended to disappear during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Instead, CV-A6 and CV-A10 have become the major prevalent serotypes, with the detection rate of CV-A6 reaching 71.1%. Large-scale CV-A6 outbreaks have been reported globally, such as Brazil, Vietnam, and France. In recent years, some Provinces in China have also reported HFMD outbreaks associated with CV-A6. Patients affected by CV-A6 tend to endure a higher fever, have a more prolonged disease course, and display more severe skin manifestations than typically associated with HFMD. In addition, the atypical manifestations of HFMD caused by CV-A6 have increased significantly, including Gianotti Rossi-like rash, Coxsackie eczema, petechiae/purpura rash, onychomadesis, and blister. Due to their skin manifestations, similar to those of other serious skin diseases, it is difficult to accurately and timely diagnose them in clinical practice. Severely ill patients infected with CV-A6 will exhibit neurologic symptoms such as vomiting and convulsions. In severe cases, acute myocardial injury and left ventricular dysfunction may also occur. Animal studies have shown that CV-A6 infection induces brain and spinal cord damage in mice, accompanied by neuronal reduction, apoptosis, and astrocyte activation. This cardiophilic and neurophilic nature of CV-A6 places a tremendous burden on society and families.

In this study, we aimed to analyze the epidemiological and genetic characterizations of CV-A6 infection and explore the risk factors for severe disease, which will provide a reference for related medical workers and a scientific basis for the prevention of CV-A6.

### Atypical cutaneous findings of hand-foot-mouth disease in children: a systematic review [^1491cd82]. Pediatric Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hand-foot-mouth disease (HFMD) is a common childhood infectious disease. Atypical skin findings of HFMD, often associated with coxsackievirus A6 (CVA6), were first reported in 2008, with increasing reports worldwide since. Atypical lesions of HFMD often involve sites beyond the palms and soles and tend to have unusual, polymorphic morphology.

Methods

A systematic review was conducted on clinical features and outcomes of pediatric HFMD with atypical cutaneous manifestations.

Results

Eighty-five studies were included, representing 1359 cases with mean age 2.4years and a male predominance of 61%. The most reported morphologies were vesicles (53%), papules (49%), and bullae (36%). Other morphologies included eczema herpeticum-like (19%), purpuric/petechial (7%), and Gianotti Crosti-like (4%). Common atypical sites included the arms and/or legs (47%), face (45%), and trunk (27%). CVA6 was identified in 63% of cases. Symptoms resolved in a mean of 10days. Overall, 16% of cases received treatment, most commonly with acyclovir, intravenous antibiotics, or topical steroids. The most common complications were nail changes (21%) and desquamation (4%) which occurred a mean of 3 and 2weeks after symptoms, respectively.

Conclusion

Due to unusual morphologies resembling other conditions, HFMD with atypical cutaneous findings may be misdiagnosed, leading to inappropriate and unnecessary investigations, hospitalization, and treatment. Greater awareness of atypical presentations of HFMD is warranted to improve patient care and counseling on infection control precautions.

Coxsackievirus A6 emerged as one of the predominant causative agents of hand, foot and mouth disease epidemics in many provinces of China in 2013 and 2015. This virus strain accounted for 25.9% of mild and 15.2% of severe cases in 2013 and 25.8% of mild and 16.9% of severe cases in 2015.

Relationship between HFMD Recurrence and Severe Illness

Unsurprisingly, we found that illness severity was inversely associated with age and onset-to-diagnosis interval. EV-A71 infections (OR 7.2, 95% CI 4.0–13.0) and other enterovirus infections (OR 2.7, 95% CI 1.5–5.0) were more severe than CV-A16 infections. Patients who lived in urban areas also had increased risk for severe illness (OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.3–2.5). After adjusting for these risk factors, recurrent HFMD episodes were not found to be associated with illness severity, which means the second and third HFMD episodes did not appear to be more or less severe than the first episode. In addition, the interval between the 2 episodes was not related to disease severity of the latter episode (OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.95–1.01) (Table 2).

### Epidemiological characterization of hand, foot, and mouth disease among hospitalized children from 2014 to 2023 in a hospital in henan province: longitudinal surveillance study [^00e98f43]. Journal of Medical Virology (2024). Medium credibility.

Hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) is an acute infectious illness primarily caused by enteroviruses. The present study aimed to describe the epidemiological characteristics of hospitalized HFMD patients in a hospital in Henan Province (Zhengzhou, China), and to predict the future epidemiological parameters. In this study, we conducted a retrospective analysis of general demographic and clinical data on hospitalized children who were diagnosed with HFMD from 2014 to 2023. We used wavelet analysis to determine the periodicity of the disease. We also conducted an analysis of the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic on the detection ratio of severe illness. Additionally, we employed a Seasonal Difference Autoregressive Moving Average (SARIMA) model to forecast characteristics of future newly hospitalized HFMD children. A total of 19487 HFMD cases were included in the dataset. Among these cases, 1515 (7.8%) were classified as severe. The peak incidence of HFMD typically fell between May and July, exhibiting pronounced seasonality. The emergence of COVID-19 pandemic changed the ratio of severe illness. In addition, the best-fitted seasonal ARIMA model was identified as (2,0,2)(1,0,1) 1.200000000000000e+01 The incidence of severe cases decreased significantly following the introduction of the vaccine to the market (χ 2 = 109.9, p < 0.05). The number of hospitalized HFMD cases in Henan Province exhibited a seasonal and declining trend from 2014 to 2023. Non-pharmacological interventions implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic have led to a reduction in the incidence of severe illness.

### Emerging enterovirus A71 subgenogroup B5 causing severe hand, foot, and mouth disease, Vietnam, 2023 [^95afef6f]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Previous peaks of EV-A71 outbreaks in Vietnam occurred during September–November, coinciding with school reopening after the summer holiday (June–August). As of November 2023, the outbreak in Vietnam was still ongoing and had resulted in > 100,000 infections and 23 deaths across the country. The potential for severe EV-A71–associated HFMD outbreaks to spread to other parts of the world should be closely monitored.

Inactivated EV-A71 vaccines have been developed in China and Taiwan but have only been used in China. Real-world data have shown that those vaccines substantially reduced EV-A71–associated disease transmission in China. Thus, using EV-A71 vaccines in other HFMD-endemic countries could have a similar effect. However, the extent to which EV-A71 vaccines might shape HFMD dynamics as a whole should be closely monitored. Because HFMD is transmitted through the oral-fecal route, good hygiene is critical to reduce EV-A71 transmission.

In conclusion, the 2023 outbreak of severe HFMD in Vietnam has mainly been caused by an emerging EV-A71 subgenogroup B5 lineage, and older children have been affected. Clinicians should recognize the diverse clinical manifestations of HFMD. Furthermore, enhanced EV-A71 surveillance is needed to inform the outbreak response in Vietnam and elsewhere, should the virus spread.

### Coxsackievirus B5 associated with hand-foot-mouth disease in a healthy adult [^36c5b1c2]. JAAD Case Reports (2017). Low credibility.

Based on the history and physical examination, HFMD was diagnosed. The elevated CVB5 titer and pathology results were also strongly suggestive of this diagnosis. Other diagnoses to be considered were herpangina, aphthous ulcers, varicella, gingivostomatitis, erythema multiforme, and drug eruption. Symptomatic treatment was discussed, and the patient was given prescriptions for viscous and topical lidocaine for the painful oral and scalp lesions, respectively. In addition, as-needed analgesics, such as Tylenol and ibuprofen, and maintaining adequate oral fluid intake were discussed. At 1 week of follow-up, the patient stated his sore throat had decreased slightly, and the lesions on his scalp had already begun to resolve. At 1 month, the patient stated his fingernails had begun to shed from the nail base (onychomadesis). In addition, the skin and mucosal lesions almost completely resolved at this point. He reached his normal state of health with regrowth of new fingernails by 2 months postinfection.

### The effect of school closure on hand, foot, and mouth disease transmission in Singapore: a modeling approach [^190cd15f]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2018). Low credibility.

Public holiday effect.

There are typically 11 public holidays in Singapore each year, as detailed in; these are a mix of secular and religious holidays, some of which rotate around the year following the lunar calendar. If a public holiday falls on Sunday, the following Monday will be a public holiday. We derived the dates of all public holidays from 2003 to 2012 from the official listing of the Ministry of Manpower.

The effect of public holiday on HFMD transmission was measured by quantifying the reduction attributable to the public holiday. Because time points not immediately preceding or following a public holiday contribute little information to the effect of the public holiday, rather than considering a time series model, we developed a Bayesian model of the time points surrounding public holidays. The number of cases in the week before the holidayis modeled as, and the number the week after as, orfor two-day-long holidays. Here, represents the average number of cases on a typical day; estimates ofand a 95% credible interval provide a measure of the public holiday effect (i.e.is the reduction in the number of infections on a public holiday compared with that on a normal day); andis an individual week effect which has an expected value of 1 and allows for autocorrelation in the time series. The window length of 1 week was selected to ensure balance in the number of weekdays in each window and to correspond roughly to the assumed incubation period of HFMD of around 3–7 days. This model assumes that the difference between the number of cases prior or after the public holidays is purely because of the difference in the number of infections happening on the public holiday, which is unobservable but indirectly represented by the change in the number of symptomatic cases in the following weeks.

To assess whether there was any longer term impact, we repeated the analysis comparing incidence in the second week (days 8–14) following the holiday with the week before it, as well as in the third week (days 15–21).

The main analysis does not treat public holidays that were less than 7 days apart specially. In sensitivity analysis, we removed data corresponding to both holidays from the fitting procedure if they were less than 7 days apart. Sensitivity analysis was also conducted by applying different forms of the non-informative prior distributions for the parameters to test the robustness of the inference.

### Hand, foot, and mouth disease in China, 2008–12: an epidemiological study [^ed2089b5]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

Background

Hand, foot, and mouth disease is a common childhood illness caused by enteroviruses. Increasingly, the disease has a substantial burden throughout east and southeast Asia. To better inform vaccine and other interventions, we characterised the epidemiology of hand, foot, and mouth disease in China on the basis of enhanced surveillance.

Methods

We extracted epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory data from cases of hand, foot, and mouth disease reported to the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention between Jan 1, 2008, and Dec 31, 2012. We then compiled climatic, geographical, and demographic information. All analyses were stratified by age, disease severity, laboratory confirmation status, and enterovirus serotype.

Findings

The surveillance registry included 7,200,092 probable cases of hand, foot, and mouth disease (annual incidence, 1·2 per 1000 person-years from 2010–12), of which 267,942 (3·7%) were laboratory confirmed and 2457 (0·03%) were fatal. Incidence and mortality were highest in children aged 12–23 months (38·2 cases per 1000 person-years and 1·5 deaths per 100,000 person-years in 2012). Median duration from onset to diagnosis was 1·5 days (IQR 0·5–2·5) and median duration from onset to death was 3·5 days (2·5–4·5). The absolute number of patients with cardiopulmonary or neurological complications was 82,486 (case-severity rate 1·1%), and 2457 of 82486 patients with severe disease died (fatality rate 3·0%); 1617 of 1737 laboratory confirmed deaths (93%) were associated with enterovirus 71. Every year in June, hand, foot, and mouth disease peaked in north China, whereas southern China had semiannual outbreaks in May and September-October. Geographical differences in seasonal patterns were weakly associated with climate and demographic factors (variance explained 8–23% and 3–19%, respectively).

Interpretation

This is the largest population-based study up to now of the epidemiology of hand, foot, and mouth disease. Future mitigation policies should take into account the heterogeneities of disease burden identified. Additional epidemiological and serological studies are warranted to elucidate the dynamics and immunity patterns of local hand, foot, and mouth disease and to optimise interventions.

### Risk factors for severe hand, foot, and mouth disease infected with coxsackievirus A6: a hospital-based case-control study [^c0cbf3a3]. Journal of Medical Virology (2020). Medium credibility.

Coxsackievirus 6 (CV-A6) has been emerging as another predominant serotype for severe hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) in China, after the introduction of enterovirus 71 inactivated vaccine (EV71 vaccine) for 3 years. Data on the risk factors for severe HFMD infected with CV-A6 are limited. We interviewed the caregivers to collected data on HFMD patients who sought medical care in the People's Hospital of Baoan district, Shenzhen, from 2015 to 2017. Totally, 131 severe patients were frequency-matched by age and gender with 174 mild patients infected with CV-A6. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were conducted to analyze the risk factors for severe CV-A6 HFMD. The average age was 20.62 ± 14.18 months and 20.52 ± 12.76 months for severe and mild patients, respectively. Multivariate analyses indicated complications at birth (odds ratio [OR], 4.18; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.64–10.63), peak body temperature over 39°C (OR, 4.04; 95% CI: 2.29–7.10) and first-born child (OR, 2.17; 95% CI: 1.27–3.70) increased the risk of severe HFMD infected with CV-A6. Breastfeeding (OR, 0.52; 95% CI: 0.32–0.87), and washing hands after playing frequently (OR, 0.58; 95% CI: 0.34–0.97) were negatively associated with severe illness. Compared with HFMD with infection of EV-A71, complications at birth and first-born child were newly found to be associated with severe illness in HFMD patients infected with CV-A6.

### Hand, foot, and mouth disease caused by coxsackievirus A6, Japan, 2011 [^32b58fa0]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

In Japan, HFMD and herpangina are classified as category V infectious diseases. On the basis of clinical diagnosis, suspected infections were reported by pediatric sentinel sites on a weekly basis to the Infectious Disease Surveillance Center of the National Institute of Infectious Diseases (Tokyo, Japan). Typical clinical signs and symptoms of HFMD cases caused by CVA6 were fever, mild vesicles in oral mucosa, and skin blisters on hands, arms, feet, legs, buttocks, and nail matrixes (Figure). Some patients with HFMD had onychomadesis (periodic shedding of the nails) 1–2 months after onset of HFMD. Most cases of HFMD were self-limited. However, additional follow-up may be necessary for patients with onychomadesis who are treated at dermatology clinics.

As in other countries in the Asia–Pacific region, major causes of HFMD in Japan were CVA16 and enterovirus 71. In 2010, enterovirus 71 was identified as a major cause of HFMD. In contrast, CVA6 was consistently associated with herpangina, as were CVA2, CVA4, CVA5, and CVA10, but CVA6 was occasionally detected in HFMD case-patients. CVA6 was the major cause of herpangina in 2007, but an increase in the detection rate of CVA6 in HFMD case-patients was reported in Japan in 2009.

### Hand, foot, and mouth disease as differential diagnosis of monkeypox, Germany, August 2022 [^e92d05ff]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

To the Editor: Lewis et al. recommend considering hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) as a differential diagnosis for monkeypox on the basis of a series of 9 patients from Argentina and Bolivia with suspicion of monkeypox, of which 3/9 patients had laboratory-confirmed monkeypox and 4/9 patients had HFMD. HFMD is common in young children worldwide. Symptoms are usually mild and transient and consist of influenza-like illness, oral sores or pustules, and a palmar and plantar rash. However, reports about atypical HFMD, which is characterized by severe symptoms, unusual localization of the rash, and occurrence in immunocompetent adults, have recently increased.

Like HFMD, monkeypox often clinically manifests with influenza-like symptoms and a pustular rash. As of September 2022, > 3,500 cases have been reported in Germany, and differential diagnosis and testing has become increasingly necessary.

We report a case of a 20-year-old man who sought evaluation for monkeypox at University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf (Germany). Two days before, he began experiencing myalgias and fever, followed by a generalized rash with painful pustular lesions on the arms, hands, feet, mouth, scalp, and anus (Figure). He was taking HIV preexposure prophylaxis but had no concurrent conditions. He reported sexual contact with 2 male partners in the 14 days before symptom onset and had regularly visited his family in the previous 29 days, during which time multiple family members experienced influenza-like symptoms and a rash. The patient had called an urgent care provider the day before our evaluation and had been placed under quarantine for suspicion of monkeypox because of his clinical manifestations and medical history.

Figure

We swabbed anal, oral, and skin lesions and assessed the specimens for orthopoxvirus and enterovirus nucleic acids by PCR, which was positive for enterovirus but negative for orthopoxvirus, confirming HFMD. In conclusion, we support the suggestion to consider atypical HFMD as a differential diagnosis of monkeypox.

### The effect of school closure on hand, foot, and mouth disease transmission in Singapore: a modeling approach [^8aeb7909]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2018). Low credibility.

Table 2
Observed number of cases 1 week before and 1/2/3 weeks after the public holidays and posterior mean and 95% confidence interval derived from posterior distribution of the public holiday effect for models based on 1 week before and the first (days 1–7), second (days 8–14), and third weeks (days 15–21) after the public holiday

During school vacations, weekly number of cases were modeled to be reduced to 93% (95% CI: [0.90, 0.97]) relative to nonschool holidays for all children less than 12 years of age: 94% (95% CI: [0.90, 0.98]) for age 0–2 years, 93% (95% CI: [0.88, 0.97]) for age 3–5 years, and 90% (95% CI: [0.84, 0.96]) for age 6–11 years. Figure 1 shows the simulations for a typical year based on the modeled effects of school vacations on HFMD transmission, using typical timing of school holidays. Both overall analysis and separate models for different age groups showed similar results and are consistent with the patterns of the data for the 10-year period. The temporally structured distribution of residuals in the 1-week-ahead model forecasts is shown in. No trends were observed, suggesting that the model with a constantis adequate.

### Seasonal distribution and meteorological factors associated with hand, foot, and mouth disease among children in XI' an, northwestern China [^c1e6e65f]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Medium credibility.

In addition, the current study used the DLNM to describe the potentially nonlinear and lag effects in the time-series data; this model has been widely used to estimate the relationships between seasonal variations of infectious diseases, such as malaria, HFMD, tuberculosis, and mumps, and meteorological factors. As a result, we found that meteorological factors, including temperature, precipitation, and evaporation, had a significant impact on the occurrence of HFMD, with a lag period of 0 to 8 weeks. The positive role that temperature plays in the incidence of HFMD is well understood. The increased temperature may lead to enhanced survival, reproduction, and transmission of enteroviruses as well as higher chances of exposure for children through contact. – An increased temperature also has been shown to lower immunity in humans as well as to facilitate the spread and susceptibility of HFMD among children. – In the present study, we observed a positive impact of temperature within a short time of 2 weeks, after which the impact became negative. This may be due to a rapid change in temperature, which may cause people to alter their activities accordingly. Evaporation has been observed to have a high correlation with temperature; therefore, not surprisingly, the effects of evaporation on HFMD were similar to those of temperature. Furthermore, higher levels of evaporation may increase the transmission of virus through the additional promotion of air flow. Global climate change may be a primary contributor to the change in temperature, and children represent the most vulnerable group and are particularly at greater risk of disease.

### Epidemic hand, foot and mouth disease caused by human enterovirus 71, Singapore [^526efa4a]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

Results

Cases

The number of notifications of HFMD cases to the Ministry of the Environment increased in early September 2000 (Figure 1). The incidence peaked at 308 cases per day on October 10 and decreased to 10 cases per day by October 28. Hospital and general practice physicians and preschool-center operators reported a total of 3,790 cases during these 2 months.

Figure 1
Number of cases of hand, foot and mouth disease reported to the Singapore Ministry of Environment as surveillance for the disease, July 2000–March 2001. Each epidemiologic week begins on Sunday. Mandatory reporting of the disease began on October 1, 2000.

During the epidemic, 311 samples from 175 clinically diagnosed HFMD case-patients were submitted for virus culture. A total of 138 (78.8%) of these patients were < 4 years of age, with 12 (6.9%) > 10 years of age, the oldest being 71 years old (Table 1). The male-to-female ratio was 1.7:1.

Table 1
Age distribution of clinical and virus-positive hand, foot and mouth disease patients

At least one virus was isolated from 147 (47.3%) of the samples collected from 104 (59.4%) HFMD patients, including 2 of 3 who died. Almost all (91.5%) of these patients were < 5 years of age with the peak incidence at 1 year (Table 1). A 21-year-old woman was the only patient > 10 years of age to yield a virus, identified as HEV71, from vesicles on her hands and feet.

HEV71 was the most commonly isolated virus, detected in 76 (73.1%) of 104 case-patients (Table 2). Three of these patients had a second virus isolated concurrently: echovirus (EV) 25, Rhinovirus, and CMV. Other enteroviruses were isolated in 24 (23.1%) of samples from case-patients. Five cases of CAV16 were identified, as well as four cases each of CAV6, CAV24, and EV18; three cases of CAV10; and one case each of CAV4, CBV3, CBV4, and CBV5. Four patients (3.8%) tested positive for nonenteroviruses; CMV was isolated from their mouth and from throat swabs.

### The impact of anti-COVID-19 nonpharmaceutical interventions on hand, foot, and mouth disease – A spatiotemporal perspective in XI' an, northwestern China [^50a69da2]. Journal of Medical Virology (2022). Medium credibility.

Growing evidence has shown that anti-COVID-19 nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) can support prevention and control of various infectious diseases, including intestinal diseases. However, most studies focused on the short-term mitigating impact and neglected the dynamic impact over time. This study is aimed to investigate the dynamic impact of anti-COVID-19 NPIs on hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) over time in Xi'an City, northwestern China. Based on the surveillance data of HFMD, meteorological and web search data, Bayesian Structural Time Series model and interrupted time series analysis were performed to quantitatively measure the impact of NPIs in sequent phases with different intensities and to predict the counterfactual number of HFMD cases. From 2013 to 2021, a total number of 172,898 HFMD cases were reported in Xi'an. In 2020, there appeared a significant decrease in HFMD incidence (-94.52%, 95% CI: -97.54% to -81.95%) in the first half of the year and the peak period shifted from June to October by a small margin of 6.74% compared to the previous years of 2013 to 2019. In 2021, the seasonality of HFMD incidence gradually returned to the bimodal temporal variation pattern with a significant average decline of 61.09%. In particular, the impact of NPIs on HFMD was more evident among young children (0–3 years), and the HFMD incidence reported in industrial areas had an unexpected increase of 51.71% in 2020 autumn and winter. Results suggested that both direct and indirect NPIs should be implemented as effective public health measures to reduce infectious disease and improve surveillance strategies, and HFMD incidence in Xi'an experienced a significant rebound to the previous seasonality after a prominent decline influenced by the anti-COVID-19 NPIs.

### Prolonged breastfeeding is associated with lower risk of severe hand, foot and mouth disease in Chinese children [^0eb7e457]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2016). Low credibility.

To assess whether breastfeeding duration can affect risk of severe hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) later in childhood, we retrospectively analyzed demographic, environmental and breastfeeding data on 603 children with severe HFMD and 1036 children with mild HFMD. Multivariate analysis showed that breastfeeding for 6–12 months significantly reduced the risk of severe HFMD, as did breastfeeding for > 12 months.

### Causes and transmission of hand, foot, and mouth disease… [^f522f73e]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

How Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease Spreads Hand, foot, and mouth disease spreads easily through:

- Person-to-person contact.
- Droplets made when a person who is sick with HFMD sneezes, coughs, or talks.
- Contact with contaminated surfaces and objects. Is hand, foot, and mouth disease contagious. Yes. HFMD is caused by viruses. A person infected with one of these viruses is contagious, which means that they can pass the virus to other people. If someone is sick with HFMD, the virus can be found in their:

- Nose and throat secretions, such as saliva, drool, or nasal mucus
- Fluid from blisters
- Feces. People with HFMD are usually most contagious during the first week that they are sick. However, people can still sometimes spread the virus to others for days or weeks after symptoms go away, or even if they have no symptoms at all. How do you get hand, foot, and mouth disease.

Contact with droplets that contain the virusmade when a person sick with HFMD coughs, sneezes, or talks. Touching an infected personor making other close contact with them, such as kissing, hugging, or sharing cups or eating utensils. Touching an infected person's poop, such as changing diapers, and then touching your eyes, nose, or mouth. Touching objects and surfacesthat have the virus on them, like doorknobs or toys, and then touching your eyes, nose, or mouth. What viruses cause hand, foot, and mouth disease. HFMD is caused by viruses that belong to the enterovirus family: Coxsackievirus A16is typically the most common cause of HFMD in the United States. Other coxsackieviruses can also cause the illness. Coxsackievirus A6can also cause HFMD and the symptoms may be more severe. Enterovirus 71 has been associated with cases and outbreaks in East and Southeast Asia.

Although rare, EV-A71 has been associated with more severe diseases such as encephalitis.

### The epidemiological and clinical characteristics of hand, foot, and mouth disease in hangzhou, China, 2016 to 2018 [^36575b0f]. Clinical Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) is most frequently caused by several serotypes of human enterovirus (EV) including Enterovirus 71 (EV-A71), coxsackievirus A16 (CV-A16), or other types of EV. The aim of this study was to determine the epidemiological characteristics of HFMD and to describe the epidemiologic characteristics of HFMD among severe and mild cases. We collected 4760 HFMD cases in Hangzhou from 2016 to 2018. Specimens from these cases were collected and tested for EV-A71, CV-A16, CV-A6, CV-A10, CV-A2, and CV-A5 by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. From 2016 to 2018, the prevalence of HFMD was seasonal each year. Among the 4760 probable HFMD cases, 3559 cases were confirmed (74.8%), including 426 cases of EV-A71 infections (8.9%), 249 cases of CV-A16 infections (5.2%), and 2884 cases of other EV infections (60.6%). The percentage of other EV infections was more than 80%, which increased year by year. Random selection of samples for detection of other EV infections in 2017 and 2018, among the 1297 cases, showed there were 835 (64.4%) cases of CV-A6 infections, 177 (13.6%) cases of CV-A10 infections, 100 (7.7%) cases of CV-A2 infections, 40 (3.1%) cases of CV-A5 infections, 3 (0.02%) cases of mixed infections, and 11.0% untyped EV infections. Preschool children were still the primary population susceptible to HFMD. In severe cases, EV-A71 infection was the main cause. Characterizing the epidemiology and the relationship between severe and common cases of HFMD would provide relevant evidences for the prevention and treatment of HFMD.

### The epidemiology of hand, foot and mouth disease in Asia: a systematic review and analysis [^b45eee24]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Incubation Period

Several papers describe the incubation period (Fig. 5, Appendix 3) though it is striking that the majority do not provide a source to justify the claimed period. These unsupported claims vary substantially from paper to paper, from the incubation period "is" 3–6 daysor 3–7 days,"is usually 3–4 days, but can be. 10 days or more,"or "is usually 3–5 days (range, 2–12 days),"is "typically" 3–7 daysor 3–5 days, ranges from 5 to 7 days, or 3 to 7 daysand the "usual period" is 3–5 days "with longest period of 7 days."Only a few provide evidence to justify the claim: one reportsthat the incubation period is usually 3–7 days, citing a US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) factsheet on aseptic meningitis. Another citesan early study from Singapore, which presented the median and range for the serial interval (3 days [1–7]), not the incubation period. Another early studystates that the incubation period is "said to be" 3–5 days, but notes that this is inconsistent with the serial interval observed in the study. It appears that there is no empirical support whatsoever for any distribution of incubation periods.

### The effect of school closure on hand, foot, and mouth disease transmission in Singapore: a modeling approach [^5a3b1236]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2018). Low credibility.

Singapore implements a school closure policy for institutional hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) outbreaks, but there is a lack of empirical evidence on the effect of closure on HFMD transmission. We conducted a retrospective analysis of 197,207 cases of HFMD over the period 2003–2012 at the national level and of 57,502 cases in 10,080 institutional outbreaks over the period 2011–2016 in Singapore. The effects of school closure due to 1) institutional outbreaks, 2) public holidays, and 3) school vacations were assessed using a Bayesian time series modeling approach. School closure was associated with a reduction in HFMD transmission rate. During public holidays, average numbers of secondary cases having onset the week after dropped by 53% (95% credible interval 44–62%), and during school vacations, the number of secondary cases dropped by 7% (95% credible interval 3–10%). Schools being temporarily closed in response to an institutional outbreak reduced the average number of new cases by 1,204 (95% credible interval 1,140–1,297). Despite the positive effect in reducing transmission, the effect of school closure is relatively small and may not justify the routine use of this measure.

Epidemiological characteristics, clinical manifestations and laboratory test result

During this outbreak, to obtain more detailed information about the prognosis and the delayed symptoms such as desquamation and onychomadesis, we contacted all the HFMD patients in this the outbreak. Five parents of the patients refused, thus, 51(91.1%) volunteered to enroll in this study and were successfully followed up at 4th and 9th week after illness onset. Among the 51 patients, 26 (51.0%) were girls, and the median age was 44 months (IQR 41.0–51.0). Six out of 51 cases (11.8%) had a history of HFMD disease.

All the cases sought for medical treatment and were clinically diagnosed as mild HFMD in seven hospitals and fully recovered without any complications. Epidemiology and clinical presentations of HFMD cases in this study were shown in Table 2. The most common clinical manifestation was skin rash (51/51, 100.0%), followed by fever (43/51, 84.3%). A total of 35 children (68.6%, 35/51) developed desquamation within the 1st and the 4rd week after disease onset. Of the 51 patients, 22 (43.1%) experienced onychomadesis between the 3rd and 8th week after disease onset (Additional file 1). The most common location of onychomadesis on the hands and feet were the thumbs (17/51, 33.3%) and halluces (8/51, 15.7%), respectively. In total, 68 finger nails from 22 kids and 17 ft nails from 8 children were found with onychomadesis. Twelve (54.5%, 12/22) cases showed the symptom of onychomadesis on symmetrical location. Among the 51 patients, two (3.9%) lost all their fingernails.

### Atypical presentations of hand, foot, and mouth disease caused by coxsackievirus A6 – Minnesota, 2014 [^fc8a868a]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2015). Low credibility.

In June, 2014, the Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) was notified of a suspected varicella case in a child aged 2 years. The patient had a generalized rash with relative sparing of the trunk and was hospitalized overnight for treatment of dehydration. The child's mother, who was near the end of a pregnancy, also had a generalized rash, which included the perineal area. Identifying the cause of the rash was important to determine whether administration of varicella zoster immune globulin was indicated to prevent neonatal varicella. Enterovirus was detected in specimens from the woman and child by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing performed at MDH; partial genome sequencing by CDC showed that both patients were infected with coxsackievirus A6 (CVA6), one of the members of the genus Enterovirus that causes hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD).

In September 2014, MDH received reports of nine suspected HFMD cases at a college with approximately 1,000 students. Patients ranged in age from 19–47 years and included seven students, one faculty member, and one staff member. Upon arrival at the campus clinic, all had lesions in the mouth, on the palms of the hands, and on the soles of the feet. One patient, aged 20 years, reported having been exposed to a child with HFMD during the previous month; this patient reported the shedding of a thumbnail about 1 month after symptom onset. Throat swabs were obtained from five patients, and an open lesion was swabbed from a sixth. Testing by MDH using RT-PCR identified Enterovirus in four of five throat swab specimens and in the swab from the lesion; isolates were subsequently sequenced and identified by CDC as CVA6. There were no complications, and all patients recovered.

### Spectrum of enterovirus serotypes causing uncomplicated hand, foot, and mouth disease and enteroviral diagnostic yield of different clinical samples [^228b7b0c]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) represents a substantial disease burden in the Western Pacific region. We investigated the spectrum of causative enteroviruses of HFMD, and evaluated different clinical samples' diagnostic yield for enteroviruses.

Methods

We enrolled pediatric patients hospitalized for HFMD among 6 hospitals in Anhua County, Hunan Province, China between October 2013 and September 2016. Throat swabs and stool samples (or rectal swabs) were collected to detect the enterovirus serotypes by real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or nested PCR.

Results

Among the 2836 patients, only 1 developed severe illness. Seventeen serotypes were identified in 2401 patients (85%), with the most frequently detected being CV-A16 (29% [814]), CV-A6 (28% [784]), EV-A71 (17% [491]), CV-A10 (4% [114]), and CV-A4 (2% [53]). Children were younger in CV-A6, CV-A10, and CV-A4 infections (median, 12 months; interquartile range [IQR], 12–24 months) than EV-A71 and CV-A16 infections (median, 24 months; IQR, 12–36 months; P < .05). The predominant enterovirus serotype shifted between CV-A16 and CV-A6 during the 3 years. Stool had a higher diagnostic yield (89%) than rectal (77%) and throat swabs (74%). Detection rates reached 93% when testing stools followed by throat swabs if stools were negative, and 89% when testing rectal swabs followed by throat swabs if rectal swabs were negative.

Conclusions

Our results provide a virological benchmark for future surveillance and diagnostics. Continuous comprehensive virological surveillance is essential, especially after implementation of the EV-A71 vaccine in China, to monitor serotype replacement and the vaccine's impact.

Background

Hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) has posed a serious threat to children's health. Three inactivated monovalent enterovirus 71 (EV71) vaccines are proved to be highly efficacious in phase III clinical trials and are now available in China.

Methods

We analyzed the citywide surveillance data on HFMD cases in Chengdu during 2009–2018, and estimated cumulative first-dose EV71 vaccination coverage among children eligible to EV71 vaccination after August 2016 in Chengdu. Time series susceptible-infected-recovered model was developed to analyze basic reproduction number and herd immunity threshold of HFMD. Overall and serotype-specific HFMD incidences and severity risks were compared before and after the EV71 vaccination.

Results

Among 3 laboratory-identified serotype categories, i.e. EV71, coxsackievirus A16 (CV-A16), and other enteroviruses, the major serotype attributed to HFMD has been changing across years. The cumulative first-dose EV71 vaccination coverage rate was estimated as 60.8% during the study period in Chengdu. By contrast, herd immunity threshold for EV71-related HFMD was 94.0%. After introduction of EV71 vaccines, the overall incidence of HFMD increased 60.8%, mainly driven by 173.7% and 11.8% increased in HFMD caused by other enteroviruses and CV-A16, respectively, which offset a significant reduction in the incidence of HFMD caused by EV71. The overall case-severity risk decreased from 1.4% to 0.3%, with significantly declined presented in all serotype categories.

Conclusions

The incidence and severity of EV71-related HFMD decreased following implementation of EV71 vaccination. Developing multivalent vaccines and strengthening laboratory-based surveillance could further decline burden of HFMD.

### Risk factors of enterovirus 71 infection and associated hand, foot, and mouth disease / herpangina in children during an epidemic in Taiwan [^bff7db33]. Pediatrics (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

In 1998, an enterovirus 71 (EV71) epidemic in Taiwan was associated with hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD)/herpangina and involved 78 fatal cases. We measured EV71 seroprevalence rates before and after the epidemic and investigated risk factors associated with EV71 infection and illness.

Methods

Neutralizing antibodies to EV71 were assayed for 539 people before the epidemic and 4619 people of similar ages after the epidemic. Questionnaires, which were completed during household interviews after the epidemic, solicited demographic variables, exposure history, and clinical manifestations.

Results

A total of 129 106 cases of HFMD were reported during the epidemic. Age-specific pre-epidemic EV71 seroprevalence rates were inversely related to age-specific periepidemic mortality rates (r = -0.82) or severe case rates (r = -0.93). Higher postepidemic EV71 seropositive rates among children who were younger than 3 years positively correlated with higher mortality rates in different areas (r = 0.88). After the epidemic, 51 (56%) of 91 younger siblings of elder siblings who were EV71-seropositive were EV71-seropositive; otherwise, 2.2% (4 of 186) of younger siblings were EV71-seropositive (matched odds ratio [OR]: 10; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.4–29). Stepwise multiple logistic regression revealed other factors associated with EV71 infection to be older age (adjusted OR: 2.5; 95% CI: 1.9–3.4), attendance at kindergartens/child care centers (adjusted OR: 1.8; 95% CI: 1.3–2.5), contact with HFMD/herpangina (adjusted OR: 1.6; 95% CI: 1.2–2.1), greater number of children in a family (adjusted OR: 1.4; 95% CI: 1.1–1.7), and rural residence (adjusted OR: 1.4; 95% CI: 1.2–1.6). Twenty-nine percent of preschool children who were infected with EV71 developed HFMD/herpangina. Younger age and contact with HFMD/herpangina were significant factors for the development of EV71-related HFMD/herpangina in these children.

Conclusions

An increased incidence of EV71 infection in young children occurred more often in geographic areas with increased mortality rates. Intrafamilial and kindergarten transmissions among preschool children were major modes of disease transmission during the widespread EV71 epidemic in Taiwan in 1998.

Table
Demographic and clinical characteristics of patients with CVA6-associated HFMD, Boston, Massachusetts, USA, 2012*

*CVA6, coxsackievirus A6; HFMD, hand, foot, and mouth disease; Tmax, maximum measured temperature; URI, upper respiratory infection, including symptoms of congestion or cough; RT-PCR, reverse transcription PCR; +, positive; VF, vesicular fluid; TS, throat swab; RS, rectal swab; NP, nasopharyngeal swab.
†Diagnosis was made by sequencing and analysis of the viral protein 1 coding region after RT-PCR.

In contrast to the typical manifestation, the patients in the Boston cluster exhibited symptoms in late winter (Table) and had perioral (Figure, panel A) and perirectal (Figure, panel B) papules and vesicles on the dorsal aspects of the hands and feet (Figure, panel C). Patients experienced a prodrome lasting 1–3 days, consisting of fever (8 patients), upper respiratory tract symptoms (4 patients), and irritability (7 patients). This prodrome was followed by the development of a perioral papular rash (8 patients), which was often impetiginized with secondary crusting; a prominent papulovesicular rash on the dorsum of the hands and feet (6 patients); and a perirectal eruption (7 patients). Half of the patients had intraoral lesions. Fever abated in most of the patients within a day after onset of the exanthem. The rash resolved over 7–14 days with no residual scarring. Samples from the oropharynx, rectum, and vesicles from these patients were sent to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Atlanta, GA, USA) for analysis. Reverse transcription PCR and sequencing by using primers specific for a portion of the viral protein 1 coding region identified CVA6 (Table).
