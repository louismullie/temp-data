## Question

A 49-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 5-month history of progressive fatigue and exertional dyspnea. Cardiac examination shows a loud S2 in the 2nd left intercostal space. Right heart catheterization shows a pulmonary artery pressure of 32 mm Hg. Treatment with bosentan is initiated. The beneficial effect of this drug is due to binding to which of the following?
A. L-type voltage-gated calcium channels
B. Phosphodiesterase-5
C. Adenosine receptors
D. Endothelin receptors

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which receptor or molecular target bosentan binds to in order to produce its therapeutic effect in pulmonary arterial hypertension, and to choose the correct option among L-type calcium channels, PDE-5, adenosine receptors, or endothelin receptors. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the patient's clinical context and whether bosentan is an appropriate therapy for PAH. Then, I should verify bosentan's mechanism of action from authoritative sources. Next, I will review the other options to ensure they map to different PAH drug classes. Finally, I will synthesize and confirm the answer with guideline and regulatory support.

> Let me first confirm the clinical scenario and drug choice. The patient has exertional dyspnea and fatigue with a mean pulmonary artery pressure around 32 mmHg, which meets hemodynamic criteria for pulmonary hypertension, and the loud pulmonic S2 suggests elevated pulmonary pressures. Bosentan is an approved oral therapy for PAH targeting the endothelin pathway, which fits this presentation and guideline-supported initial therapy in appropriate functional classes [^114NeWJE] [^113chKnp].

> Now, I need to check the exact mechanism of action. Wait, let me verify the FDA label first because it is the most definitive source for mechanism. The FDA labeling states bosentan is a specific and competitive antagonist at endothelin receptor types ETA and ETB, with slightly higher affinity for ETA, and that endothelin-1 concentrations are elevated in PAH, supporting pathogenic relevance and the rationale for receptor blockade [^117GVtqi] [^115xEiFT]. I should also confirm this with independent reviews; multiple sources describe bosentan as a dual endothelin receptor antagonist that blocks ETA and ETB to oppose vasoconstriction and proliferation, aligning with the label's mechanism [^116bjCvL] [^115HBBCJ].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — I should review the distractors to ensure I'm not missing a nuance. L-type calcium channel blockers are a different class used selectively in vasoreactive PAH responders, not the target of bosentan; phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors like sildenafil and tadalafil act on the nitric oxide–cGMP pathway, not endothelin receptors; and adenosine receptors are not a recognized target of PAH therapies in this context, so these options do not match bosentan's pharmacology [^116LKmCx] [^111cqLsL] [^113Xe9BT].

> I should double-check the clinical implications of this mechanism to ensure internal consistency. By competitively blocking ETA and ETB, bosentan reduces endothelin-1–mediated pulmonary vasoconstriction and smooth muscle proliferation, improving pulmonary vascular resistance and exercise capacity in randomized trials and real-world cohorts, which is consistent with observed benefits in WHO functional class II–IV PAH patients [^111hjNbD] [^114FuFJK] [^114NeWJE].

> Putting this together, the correct answer is D, endothelin receptors, because bosentan functions as a dual ETA/ETB receptor antagonist that competitively inhibits endothelin-1 signaling to achieve vasodilation and antiproliferative effects in PAH, as established in regulatory labeling and corroborated by clinical literature and guidelines [^117GVtqi] [^114NeWJE] [^116bjCvL].

---

The beneficial effect of bosentan in pulmonary arterial hypertension is due to its **dual antagonism of endothelin A and B receptors** [^117GVtqi], which blocks endothelin-1–mediated vasoconstriction and proliferation, thereby lowering pulmonary vascular resistance and improving hemodynamics and exercise capacity [^111hjNbD] [^114FuFJK]. The correct answer is **D. Endothelin receptors**.

---

## Mechanism of action of bosentan

Bosentan is a **non-selective endothelin receptor antagonist** that competitively blocks both ETA and ETB receptors [^117GVtqi], with slightly higher affinity for ETA [^115xEiFT]. Endothelin-1 (ET-1), a potent vasoconstrictor and mitogen, is elevated in PAH and drives vasoconstriction, smooth muscle proliferation, and fibrosis via ETA/ETB signaling [^116bjCvL]. By blocking these receptors, bosentan reduces pulmonary vascular resistance, improves cardiac output, and enhances exercise capacity [^111hjNbD] [^114FuFJK].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting endothelin receptor antagonism

Multiple randomized trials and guidelines confirm that **bosentan improves outcomes in PAH** [^114NeWJE]:

- **BREATHE-1**: Improved 6-minute walk distance (6MWD), functional class, and delayed clinical worsening [^111hjNbD].
- **EARLY**: Reduced pulmonary vascular resistance and improved hemodynamics in WHO FC II patients [^114FuFJK].
- **ESC/ERS 2022**: Recommends bosentan to improve exercise capacity and reduce clinical worsening in PAH [^114NeWJE].

---

## Comparison with other options

| **Option** | **Mechanism of action** | **Relevance to bosentan** |
|-|-|-|
| A. L-type voltage-gated calcium channels | Calcium channel blockade causes vasodilation | Not targeted by bosentan; used by calcium channel blockers |
| B. Phosphodiesterase-5 | Increases cGMP, causing vasodilation | Not targeted by bosentan; used by sildenafil/tadalafil |
| C. Adenosine receptors | Mediates vasodilation via cAMP | Not targeted by bosentan; not a PAH therapy |
| D. Endothelin receptors | Blocks ETA/ETB, reducing vasoconstriction and proliferation | Primary target of bosentan |

---

## Clinical implications of endothelin receptor antagonism

Bosentan's dual ETA/ETB blockade provides **hemodynamic and clinical benefits**, including reduced pulmonary vascular resistance, improved cardiac output, and better exercise capacity [^111hjNbD] [^114FuFJK]. It also delays clinical worsening and is recommended for PAH management [^114NeWJE].

---

## Safety considerations

Bosentan carries **hepatotoxicity risk**; monthly liver function monitoring is required [^115rSrwm] [^114NeWJE]. It is teratogenic and contraindicated in pregnancy, and interacts with CYP3A4/CYP2C9 substrates, including warfarin and hormonal contraceptives [^115WdHc9].

---

Bosentan's benefit in PAH is due to its **dual antagonism of endothelin A and B receptors** [^114NeWJE], which reduces pulmonary vascular resistance and improves hemodynamics and exercise capacity [^111HEUPx]. The correct answer is **D. Endothelin receptors**.

Comparative trials

A unique data set is provided by the STRIDE-2 trial, in which 245 patients were randomized to placebo, sitaxentan (50 or 100 mg q.d.), or bosentan (62.5 mg b.i.d. for 1 month followed by 125 mg b.i.d.). The bosentan arm was, however, open label and included only as a comparator arm (events were rater-blinded). At 18 weeks, both sitaxentan 100 mg and bosentan arms showed significant increases in 6MWD, the primary endpoint. Improvements in functional class (secondary endpoint) were observed with sitaxentan 100 mg (P = 0.04). Time to clinical worsening did not improve with either treatment.

After 18 weeks, patients were entered into the extension study STRIDE-2X where patients who received sitaxentan (100 mg) or bosentan during STRIDE-2 continued on their respective therapies, in an open-label fashion. Patients receiving sitaxentan 50 mg daily during STRIDE-2 had their dosages increased to 100 mg daily, and the patients on placebo were assigned to sitaxentan (100 mg daily) or bosentan. Preliminary results of pre-specified analyses for patients treated for up to 1 year (bosentan, n = 84; sitaxentan, n = 145) revealed differences between the treatment arms, with better outcomes for the sitaxentan-treated patients when compared with bosentan therapy in parameters such as risk of discontinuation of monotherapy (25 vs. 45%, P = 0.003) and abnormal liver enzyme levels (4 vs. 14%, P = 0.01). However, no significant differences between both treatment regimens were observed for functional class, 6MWD, or survival. Thus, no clinically meaningful differences between these drugs with respect to selectivity-related efficacy were observed.

### Evidence for the use of combination targeted therapeutic approaches for the management of pulmonary arterial hypertension [^113inYpj]. Respiratory Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

The last decade has witnessed a remarkable increase in the number of effective treatment options available for the management of patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension. In this regard, agents belonging to the therapeutic classes that specifically target the prostacyclin, endothelin and nitric oxide pathways have shown the greatest efficacy in clinical studies to date. These various drug treatments have individually been shown to confer improvements in symptoms, exercise capacity, pulmonary haemodynamics and possibly survival in different patient subgroups. However, pulmonary arterial hypertension is characterised by dysregulation of a variety of pathways. In addition, disease worsening is inevitable for the majority of patients receiving monotherapy. As a consequence, there is increasing interest in the use of treatment combinations in order to target multiple targets with the aim of restoring normal pulmonary vascular function in order to improve clinical status. Indeed, use of multiple specific-treatment regimens is now part of routine clinical practice and is emphasized in recently published therapeutic guidelines. This review details the rationale for the different combination strategies and examines the clinical evidence in favour of some of the approaches that have been evaluated.

First-line combination therapy

There are few data available on the use of combination therapy as a first-line treatment. The BREATHE-2study investigated the effect of combined treatment with bosentan and epoprostenol versus epoprostenol and placebo in a small group of 33 patients with severe PAH (WHO FC III and IV) over 16 weeks, but did not demonstrate a significant difference between the two treatments in the primary endpoint of total pulmonary resistance. Three deaths were reported, all in the bosentan arm; however, investigators concluded that they reflected the severity and progressive nature of PAH and were not related to study treatment.

First-line combination therapy with ambrisentan and tadalafil was evaluated in the randomised, multicentre AMBITION study. This study had a dual placebo design, with one placebo group receiving ambrisentan monotherapy with placebo tadalafil, while the second placebo group received tadalafil monotherapy with placebo ambrisentan. With 610 patients enrolled, and followed up for up to 3.5 years, AMBITION was a considerably larger trial than the pioneer BREATHE-2 study. Significant improvements were seen in the composite primary endpoint of morbidity/mortality in the combination group compared with the pooled monotherapy arms, which were driven by differences in hospitalisation. Hierarchical testing of secondary endpoints showed significant improvements in N -terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), proportion of patients with satisfactory clinical response, and 6MWD. No important safety signals were observed. At the time of writing, the results of the AMBITION trial have only been presented in abstract form and have not yet been published.

Bosentan

Bosentan is an orally active, non-peptidic, non-selective, sulphonamide-class ET A /ET B antagonist with twice-daily (b.i.d.) dosing. It was the first ETRA to receive approval for the treatment of patients with PAH in NYHA functional class III (Europe, USA, and Canada) and IV (USA and Canada) at a target dose of 125 mg b.i.d.

In two randomized, controlled trials, bosentan was shown to improve exercise capacity, functional class, haemodynamics, and time to clinical worsening. Additional open-label, long-term studies in patients with PAH demonstrated persistent efficacy of bosentan over time and potential for improved survival, compared with predicted survival.

Since these first pivotal studies, significant benefits of bosentan treatment have been shown in separate studies ('Bosentan Randomized Trials of Endothelin Antagonist Therapy': BREATHE) in children with PAH[BREATHE-3: idiopathic PAH and congenital heart disease (CHD)], in PAH associated with HIV(BREATHE-4), in patients with PAH and Eisenmenger syndrome(BREATHE-5), and in patients with portopulmonary hypertension.

In addition, the 'Endothelin Antagonist tRial in miLdlY symptomatic PAH patients' (EARLY) was the first study specifically designed to evaluate the effects of ETRA treatment in 185 PAH patients in functional class II. Preliminary results from this 6 month trial highlight a significant reduction in PVR while the other primary endpoint, the 6 min walk distance (6MWD), did not reach statistical significance. The secondary endpoint, time to clinical worsening, showed a significant improvement with bosentan, translating into a 70% risk reduction.

In another group of 157 patients with chronic thrombo-embolic pulmonary hypertension (WHO Group 4), bosentan therapy led to significant reductions in PVR and improved dyspnoea score, while the 6MWD remained unchanged over the 6 month study period ('BosEntan in iNopErable Forms of chronIc Thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension': BENEFIT).

### Therapy for pulmonary arterial hypertension in adults: update of the CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^111vGA9w]. Chest (2019). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for pulmonary hypertension, more specifically with respect to PAH-specific therapy, sequential therapy, ACCP 2019 guidelines recommend to consider adding a second class of PAH therapy to improve exercise capacity in patients with PAH with WHO functional class III-IV symptoms and unacceptable clinical status despite established PAH-specific monotherapy:

| **Situation** | **Guidance** |
|-|-|
|Patients on an endothelin receptor antagonist or a PDE5 inhibitor|- Add inhaled iloprost <br/> - or inhaled treprostinil, <br/> - to improve 6MWD|
|Patients on IV epoprostenol|- Add sildenafil or up-titrate epoprostenol to improve 6MWD|
|Patients on bosentan, ambrisentan, or an inhaled prostanoid|- Add riociguat to improve 6MWD and WHO functional class, and delay the time to clinical worsening|
|Patients on a PDE5 inhibitor or an inhaled prostanoid|- Add macitentan to improve 6MWD and WHO functional class, and delay the time to clinical worsening.|

### Advanced therapies for the management of adults with pulmonary arterial hypertension due to congenital heart disease: a systematic review [^114V8mkb]. Open Heart (2018). Low credibility.

Another major limitation is that some of the studies in this review evaluated medications used as monotherapy for PAH-CHD, while others evaluated the study drug after patients had received prior treatment with other PAH-specific medications. If patients had already received prior treatment, then their response to the study drug may be blunted by any improvements previously attained in response to those earlier treatments, a finding which may hold particularly true for the currently available studies on macitentan, where many patients had previously been treated with bosentan for an extended period. Additionally, pharmacokinetic interactions between drugs may also occur; some studies have suggested that bosentan may significantly decrease plasma concentrations of sildenafil when co-administered to patients with PAH, and it is possible that similar interactions may occur between other PAH medications as well.

Finally, PATENT-1, PATENT-2, BREATHE-5 and ALPHABET were placebo-controlled trials. However, many of the studies were not placebo-controlled, making it difficult to assess whether or not a placebo effect was impacting the results reported in those studies.

14.1 Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension

WHO Functional Class III-IV

Two randomized, double-blind, multi-center, placebo-controlled trials were conducted in 32 and 213 patients. The larger study (BREATHE-1) compared 2 doses (125 mg twice daily and 250 mg twice daily) of bosentan with placebo. The smaller study (Study 351) compared 125 mg twice daily with placebo. Patients had severe (WHO functional Class III–IV) PAH: idiopathic or heritable PAH (72%) or PAH associated with scleroderma or other connective tissue diseases (21%), or to autoimmune diseases (7%). There were no patients with PAH associated with other conditions such as HIV disease or recurrent pulmonary emboli.

In both studies, bosentan or placebo was added to patients' current therapy, which could have included a combination of digoxin, anticoagulants, diuretics, and vasodilators (e.g., calcium channel blockers, ACE inhibitors), but not epoprostenol. Bosentan was given at a dose of 62.5 mg twice daily for 4 weeks and then at 125 mg twice daily or 250 mg twice daily for either 12 (BREATHE-1) or 8 (Study 351) additional weeks. The primary study endpoint was 6-minute walk distance. In addition, symptoms and functional status were assessed. Hemodynamic measurements were made at 12 weeks in Study 351.

Results

Characteristics of the studies

Tables 1 and 2 show the 23 RCTs characteristics recruiting 3199 patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension that have been published over a 18-year period (January 1990–October 2008, Figure 1). In the 21 studies included in the primary analysis, 3140 patients were enrolled. Only in one study57 patients with non-operable chronic thrombo-embolic pulmonary hypertension (Group 4) were recruited. Eight RCTs assessed the effects of prostanoids (intravenous epoprostenol, subcutaneous treprostinil, inhaled iloprost, and oral beraprost), eight RCTs assessed the effects of endothelin receptor antagonists (oral bosentan, sitxsentan, and ambrisentan), four RCTs assessed the effects of the phosphodiesterase type-5 inhibitor sildenafil, and one study the effects of the thromboxane synthase inhibitor terbogrel. Two studies, compared two different, concurrently initiated treatment regimens in naïve patients: in the BREATHE-2 study, the groups were treated with epoprostenol alone or with a combination of epoprostenol and bosentan, respectively, and in the SERAPH study, the groups were treated with bosentan or sildenafil, respectively. In four studies background therapy with bosentan, sildenafil, or epoprostenol, respectively, was allowed.

The average length of the study periods was 14.3 ± 5.9 weeks (range 8–36 weeks).

In 17 studies, the exclusive or predominant aetiology was idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension, two studies included exclusively patients with the scleroderma spectrum of diseasesor patients with Eisenmenger's syndrome.

The majority of the patients included in the RCTs were in NYHA/WHO functional class III, only one study included exclusively NYHA/WHO functional class II patients.

The 6MWD alone or in combination was the primary endpoint in 17 studies; additional primary endpoints included maximal oxygen consumption, treadmill exercise test duration, pulmonary vascular resistance, right ventricular muscle mass, and systemic blood oxygen saturation.

### Effects of the dual endothelin-receptor antagonist bosentan in patients with pulmonary hypertension: a randomised placebo-controlled study [^116Z883M]. Lancet (2001). Excellent credibility.

Background

Endothelin 1, a powerful endogenous vasoconstrictor and mitogen, might be a cause of pulmonary hypertension. We describe the efficacy and safety of bosentan, a dual endothelin-receptor antagonist that can be taken orally, in patients with severe pulmonary hypertension.

Methods

In this double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 32 patients with pulmonary hypertension (primary or associated with scleroderma) were randomly assigned to bosentan (62.5mg taken twice daily for 4 weeks then 125 mg twice daily) or placebo for a minimum of 12 weeks. The primary endpoint was change in exercise capacity. Secondary endpoints included changes in cardiopulmonary haemodynamics, Borg dyspnoea index, WHO functional class, and withdrawal due to clinical worsening. Analysis was by intention to treat.

Findings

In patients given bosentan, the distance walked in 6 min improved by 70 m at 12 weeks compared with baseline, whereas it worsened by 6 m in those on placebo (difference 76 m [95% CI 12–139], p = 0.021). The improvement was maintained for at least 20 weeks. The cardiac index was 1.0 L min⁻¹ m⁻² (95% CI 0.6–1.4, p < 0.0001) greater in patients given bosentan than in those given placebo. Pulmonary vascular resistance decreased by 223 dyn s cm⁻⁵ with bosentan, but increased by 191 dyn s cm⁻⁵ with placebo (difference -415 [-608 to -221], p = 0.0002). Patients given bosentan had a reduced Borg dyspnoea index and an improved WHO functional class. All three withdrawals from clinical worsening were in the placebo group (p = 0.033). The number and nature of adverse events did not differ between the two groups.

Interpretation

Bosentan increases exercise capacity and improves haemodynamics in patients with pulmonary hypertension, suggesting that endothelin has an important role in pulmonary hypertension.

Selectivity and PAH associated with connective tissue disease

Of the wide spectrum of diseases encompassed by the term 'pulmonary hypertension', PAH with associated CTD (PAH-CTD) is a disease for which patients have a particularly poor prognosis. Importantly, this subgroup has been included in several trials evaluating ETRAs; however, the clinical relevance of ET-receptor selectivity in this patient group has not been specifically explored.

The BREATHE-1 trial included 47 patients with systemic sclerosis (22%). In contrast to patients with IPAH, bosentan did not significantly increase 6MWD. However, the decline in walking distance of 40 m at 16 weeks in the systemic sclerosis placebo group (n = 14) was prevented by bosentan (+3 m, n = 33).

For ambrisentan, comparable efficacy with respect to functional capacity, measured as 6MWD, was described for 19 patients (30%) with PAH associated with collagen vascular disease, when compared to patients with idiopathic PAH.

A post hoc analysis of 42 patients with PAH-CTD enrolled in the STRIDE-1 studyshowed that during the 12 week placebo-controlled phase, sitaxentan (pooled 100 and 300 mg groups) increased the placebo-subtracted 6MWD by 58 m (P = 0.027), improved haemodynamics, as well as certain domains within the quality-of-life assessment. Notably, in contrast to the bosentan data, sitaxentan not only prevented deterioration of exercise capacity but also significantly improved 6MWD by 20 m (P = 0.037), compared with baseline. In another post hoc meta-analysis pooling 512 patients from STRIDE-1, STRIDE-2, and STRIDE-4, a subgroup of 129 patients with PAH-CTD was analysed. Within this subgroup, 39 patients treated with sitaxentan 100 mg daily showed a significantly improved 6MWD by 38 m (P = 0.0419), compared with placebo. This effect was not seen with sitaxentan 50 or 300 mg daily in this PAH subgroup.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Bosentan is a specific and competitive antagonist at endothelin receptor types ETAand ETB. Bosentan has a slightly higher affinity for ETAreceptors than for ETBreceptors. The clinical impact of dual endothelin blockage is unknown.

Endothelin-1 (ET-1) is a neurohormone, the effects of which are mediated by binding to ETAand ETBreceptors in the endothelium and vascular smooth muscle. ET-1 concentrations are elevated in plasma and lung tissue of patients with PAH, suggesting a pathogenic role for ET-1 in this disease.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

General

After oral administration, maximum plasma concentrations of bosentan are attained within 3 to 5 hours and the terminal elimination half-life is about 5 hours in healthy adult subjects. The exposure to bosentan after intravenous and oral administration is about twice as high in adult patients with PAH as it is in healthy adult subjects.

Absorption

The absolute bioavailability of bosentan in normal volunteers is about 50% and is unaffected by food.

Bosentan is highly bound (> 98%) to plasma proteins, mainly albumin. Bosentan does not penetrate into erythrocytes. The volume of distribution is about 18 L.

Elimination

Metabolism

Bosentan has three metabolites, one of which is pharmacologically active and may contribute 10% to 20% of the effect of bosentan. Bosentan is an inducer of CYP2C9 and CYP3A and possibly also of CYP2C19. Upon multiple oral dosing, plasma concentrations in healthy adults decrease gradually to 50% to 65% of those seen after single dose administration, probably the effect of auto-induction of the metabolizing liver enzymes. Steady-state is reached within 3 to 5 days.

Excretion

Bosentan is eliminated by biliary excretion following metabolism in the liver. Less than 3% of an administered oral dose is recovered in urine. Total clearance after a single intravenous dose is about 4 L/h in patients with PAH.

Treatment Advances and Clinical Course

Drug strategies in PAH have largely focused on exerting vasodilatory activity with reverse remodeling, selectively targeting pulmonary arterioles. All 12 PAH‐approved pharmacotherapies modulate 1 of 3 major signaling pathways administrated with a variety of methodologies,: (1) prostacyclin signaling (eg, epoprostenol, iloprost, treprostinil, selexipag),(2) endothelin receptor antagonists (eg, ambrisentan, macitentan, bosentan), and (3) nitric oxide bioactivity (eg, tadalafil, sildenafil, riociguat). In a subset of patients with PAH, high‐dose calcium channel blockers have sustained clinical resolution, including in patients initially experiencing beneficial response to vasodilator therapy.

### Endothelin receptor antagonist and airway dysfunction in pulmonary arterial hypertension [^115iYGBf]. Respiratory Research (2009). Low credibility.

Conclusion

This is the first study evaluating the effects of ET-I receptor antagonist therapy on lung function in patients with IPAH. Significant expiratory airflow limitation indicating peripheral airway obstruction was found. During 3 and 12 months of bosentan treatment, the markers of hemodynamic, functional and serum biomarker disease severity improved. However, expiratory airflow limitation persisted.

Given the still suboptimal therapeutical options to improve the functional state in IPAH patients, the underlying mechanisms and possible interventions of peripheral airway obstruction should be further evaluated.

Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) with WHO functional class (FC) II symptoms — oral therapy context and approvals are summarized as follows: Direct comparisons of available oral monotherapies have not been performed, and "we do not make recommendations or suggestions of one agent, or class of agent, over another". Three orally active ETRAs (bosentan, ambrisentan, and macitentan), two orally active PDE5 inhibitors (sildenafil and tadalafil), and riociguat are approved in the United States, and "All six drugs are approved for the treatment of patients with PAH in WHO FC II"; however, "Only about one-third of the patients enrolled into any of these studies were FC II at baseline", and "With the exception of a single clinical trial of bosentan, no clinical trial has been designed to specifically examine the effect of treatment on patients with PAH in FC II". Accordingly, "the available data suggest that patients with PAH with WHO FC II disease are likely to benefit from treatment with an ETRA, PDE5 inhibitor, or the soluble guanylate cyclase stimulator riociguat", but "The committee did not believe adequate information is available to permit recommending one agent over another".

### Effects of the dual endothelin receptor antagonist bosentan in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension: a 1-year follow-up study [^112gsey3]. Chest (2003). Low credibility.

Study Objectives

We report on the long-term safety and efficacy of bosentan treatment in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH).

Background

In a preceding study, bosentan was well tolerated and significantly improved the exercise capacity and hemodynamics of patients with PAH after 12 weeks of treatment.

Design

The present study was an open-label extension to the preceding double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 32 patients with PAH (primary or associated with scleroderma) who received bosentan or placebo at 125 mg bid for 3 to 7 months.

Patients

Twenty-nine of the original 32 patients received bosentan for an additional year (62.5 mg bid for 4 weeks and then 125 mg bid).

Interventions

Study end points included long-term safety, 6-min walk distance at week 4, modified New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class of PAH at month 12, and the occurrence of withdrawal due to clinical worsening. Additional exploratory analyses included a walk test at month 6 for 19 patients and hemodynamic assessment at month 12 for 11 patients.

Results

At month 6, assessed patients continuing bosentan treatment maintained the improvement in walk distance observed at the end of the previous study (mean ± SEM, 60 ± 11 m), and patients starting bosentan treatment improved their walk distance by 45 ± 13 m. Long-term treatment with bosentan for > 1 year was associated with an improvement in hemodynamic parameters and modified NYHA functional class. Overall, bosentan treatment was well tolerated. No patient underwent transplantation or died.

Conclusions

Long-term treatment with bosentan is safe and has sustained benefits on exercise capacity and hemodynamics in patients with PAH.

### Bosentan (Tracleer) [^115xEiFT]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Bosentan is a specific and competitive antagonist at endothelin receptor types ETAand ETB. Bosentan has a slightly higher affinity for ETAreceptors than for ETBreceptors. The clinical impact of dual endothelin blockage is unknown.

Endothelin-1 (ET-1) is a neurohormone, the effects of which are mediated by binding to ETAand ETBreceptors in the endothelium and vascular smooth muscle. ET-1 concentrations are elevated in plasma and lung tissue of patients with PAH, suggesting a pathogenic role for ET-1 in this disease.

General

After oral administration, maximum plasma concentrations of bosentan are attained within 3–5 hours and the terminal elimination half-life is about 5 hours in healthy adult subjects. The exposure to bosentan after intravenous and oral administration is about twice as high in adult patients with PAH as it is in healthy adult subjects.

In a relative bioavailability study in healthy adults, the peak plasma concentration and area under the plasma concentration-time curve for bosentan are on an average 14% and 11%, respectively, lower following administration of the oral dispersible tablet compared to the film-coated tablet.

Absorption

The absolute bioavailability of bosentan in normal volunteers is about 50% and is unaffected by food.

Bosentan is highly bound (> 98%) to plasma proteins, mainly albumin. Bosentan does not penetrate into erythrocytes. The volume of distribution is about 18 L.

Elimination

Metabolism

Bosentan has three metabolites, one of which is pharmacologically active and may contribute 10%–20% of the effect of bosentan. Bosentan is an inducer of CYP2C9 and CYP3A and possibly also of CYP2C19. Upon multiple oral dosing, plasma concentrations in healthy adults decrease gradually to 50–65% of those seen after single dose administration, probably the effect of auto-induction of the metabolizing liver enzymes. Steady-state is reached within 3–5 days.

Excretion

Bosentan is eliminated by biliary excretion following metabolism in the liver. Less than 3% of an administered oral dose is recovered in urine. Total clearance after a single intravenous dose is about 4 L/h in patients with PAH.

### Inhibition of endothelin receptors in the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension: does selectivity matter? [^116ZX2UZ]. European Heart Journal (2008). Low credibility.

Haemodynamics

Since ET A and ET B receptors counter-regulate vascular tone, variations in receptor selectivity could result in different haemodynamic profiles.

The haemodynamic changes from baseline to Week 12 for bosentan and sitaxentan are shown in Table 3. Despite differing study populations, both drugs equally reduced PVR by an average of 220 dynes s cm −5 following a 3 month treatment period; comparable with the decrease of 226 ± 202 dynes s cm −5 reported for ambrisentan. Small differences in favour of less-selective ETRAs were observed with respect to right atrial pressure reductions.

Haemodynamic superiority of selective ET A blockade, theoretically mediated by unblocked ET B receptors, cannot be inferred from these data. Likewise, non-selective ETRA blockade does not seem to be associated with clear haemodynamic advantages when indirectly compared with selective blockade.

### Pulmonary arterial hypertension: from the kingdom of the near-dead to multiple clinical trial meta-analyses [^116KURwz]. European Heart Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Progress of medical treatment in pulmonary arterial hypertension

Two decades ago, patients with idiopathic PAH were defined as the 'kingdom of the near-dead'to outline their dismal median survival rate that, at that time, was 2.8 years from the diagnosis, despite any available supportive treatment. Usually, rare and severe conditions are neglected by both the medical community and the pharmaceutical industry due to the intrinsic difficulties of performing experimental and clinical research in these fields. In fact, meaningful randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in these settings require a worldwide collaboration of expert centres operating with a similar standard of medical care and relatively large financial resources with a rather high risk of study failure. The recent history of drug development in PAH contradicts this traditional perspective and it is worthwhile to analyse the details of this phenomenon.

Without a doubt, the progress made in the medical treatment of PAH in the past 15 years is unique, particularly for a rare and severe condition: almost 30 RCTs have been completed and more than 10 are either ongoing or planned. Twenty-five RCTs have been published as of May 2010 (Figure 3). Eight drugs (ambrisentan, bosentan, epoprostenol, iloprost, sildenafil, sitaxentan, tadalafil, treprostinil) belonging to three pharmacological classes (endothelin receptor antagonists, phosphodiesterase type-5 inhibitors, and prostanoids) administered by four different routes (oral, inhaled, subcutaneous, and intravenous) have been currently approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and/or by the European Medicines Agency (EMA). All three classes of drugs exert both vasodilator and antiproliferative effects and interfere with the endothelial dysfunction abnormalities observed in PAH patients (Figure 2).

European Heart Journal (2009). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) pharmacotherapy in advanced disease — Non-responders to acute vasoreactivity testing, or responders who remain in (or progress to) WHO-FC III should be considered candidates for treatment with either an ERA or a phosphodiesterase type-5 inhibitor, or a prostanoid. As head-to-head comparisons among different compounds are not available, no evidence-based first-line treatment can be proposed, and some experts still use first-line i.v. epoprostenol in WHO-FC III patients because of its survival benefits. For WHO-FC IV, continuous i.v. epoprostenol is recommended as first-line therapy; although ambrisentan, bosentan, and sildenafil are approved in WHO-FC IV patients in the USA, most experts consider these treatments as a second line in severely ill patients. In WHO-FC IV patients, initial combination therapy should also be considered. In the case of inadequate clinical response, sequential combination therapy should be considered; combinations can include either an ERA plus a phosphodiesterase type-5 inhibitor, or a prostanoid plus an ERA, or a prostanoid plus a phosphodiesterase type-5 inhibitor, and in expert centres triple combination therapy is considered. For inadequate responders despite optimal therapy or where treatments are unavailable, BAS and/or lung transplantation are indicated and should be performed only in experienced centres.

Pediatric Studies

The efficacy of bosentan was evaluated in an open-label, uncontrolled study in 19 pediatric patients with PAH aged 3 to 15 years. Patients had primary pulmonary hypertension (n = 10) or PAH related to congenital heart diseases (9 patients) and were WHO functional class II (n = 15, 79%) or class III (n = 4; 21%) at baseline. Patients were dosed with bosentan at approximately 2 mg/kg twice daily (body weight adjusted dose, corresponding to the recommended adult dose) [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)] for 12 weeks. Half of the patients in each group were already being treated with intravenous epoprostenol and the dose of epoprostenol remained constant for the duration of the study.

Hemodynamics were measured in 17 patients (Table 7). The mean decrease in PVR was 389 dyn•sec•cm⁻⁵, which was similar to the effect seen in adults. Hemodynamic improvements from baseline were similar with or without coadministration of epoprostenol.

### Role of ambrisentan in the management of pulmonary hypertension [^116DoQyn]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the role of ambrisentan in the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH).

Data Sources

Literature was accessed through MEDLINE (1950-June 2008), Iowa Drug Information Service (1966-March 2008), EMBASE (1966-June 2008), bibliographies of pertinent articles, and unpublished data provided by the manufacturer and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Search terms included ambrisentan, endothelin antagonist, pulmonary hypertension, and pulmonary arterial hypertension. Due to limited literature available, additional criteria to limit searches were not used.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Abstracts and original preclinical and clinical research reports available in the English language were identified for review. All manufacturer-provided data were also evaluated. Literature related to ambrisentan, endothelin antagonists, pulmonary hypertension, and pulmonary arterial hypertension were included. Four clinical trials evaluated the efficacy of ambrisentan in adults with symptomatic PAH.

Data Synthesis

Ambrisentan is the latest endothelin-receptor antagonist (ERA) to obtain FDA approval for the treatment of PAH. It joins the first FDA-approved ERA, bosentan. Like bosentan, ambrisentan is available orally (with once-daily dosing compared with bosentan's twice-daily dosing) and has been shown to improve exercise capacity and delay clinical worsening. As with bosentan, the most significant safety concerns with ambrisentan relate to potential liver injury and a contraindication in pregnancy. Although ambrisentan has higher affinity for the endothelin type A receptor than for the endothelin type B receptor, specific advantages of this selectivity, in terms of efficacy compared with bosentan, a nonselective agent, have not been demonstrated.

Conclusions

Ambrisentan has been shown to be an effective ERA in patients with PAH. A significant advantage of ambrisentan is the lack of any clinically important drug interactions with warfarin and sildenafil, which are frequently used by patients being treated for PAH.

Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension in Adults related to Congenital Heart Disease with Left-to-Right Shunts

A small study (N = 54) and its open-label extension (N = 37) of up to 40 weeks in adult patients with Eisenmenger physiology demonstrated effects of TRACLEER on exercise and safety that were similar to those seen in other trials in patients with PAH (WHO Group 1).

14.2 Lack of Benefit in Congestive Heart Failure

TRACLEER is not effective in the treatment of congestive heart failure with left ventricular dysfunction. In a pair of studies, 1613 subjects with NYHA Class III-IV heart failure, left ventricular ejection fraction < 35%, on diuretics, ACE inhibitor, and other therapies, were randomized to placebo or TRACLEER (62.5 mg twice daily titrated as tolerated to 125 mg twice daily) and followed for up to 70 weeks. Use of TRACLEER was associated with no benefit on patient global assessment (the primary end point) or mortality. However, hospitalizations for heart failure were more common during the first 4 to 8 weeks after TRACLEER was initiated. In a placebo-controlled trial of patients with severe chronic heart failure, there was an increased incidence of hospitalization for CHF associated with weight gain and increased leg edema during the first 4–8 weeks of treatment with TRACLEER. Patients required intervention with a diuretic, fluid management, or hospitalization for decompensating heart failure.

Endothelin Receptor Antagonists

Activation of endothelin receptors on endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells leads to potent vasoconstriction. Increased expression of endothelin‐1 in vascular endothelial cells has been associated with PH development, rendering it a potential treatment target in this disease. In fact, endothelin receptor antagonists (ERAs) such as bosentan, ambrisentan, and macitentan have been approved for the treatment of PAH. Some evidence has also suggested an association of endothelin‐1 with HF development and progression, further emphasizing the importance of investigating its role in the treatment of PH‐LHD. The ERAs bosentan, macitentan, and darusetan have not shown significant benefit in clinical trials of PH‐LHD and have raised concern for greater adverse effects. The goal of the REACH‐1 (Research on Endothelin Antagonism in Chronic Heart Failure) pilot study was to investigate the long‐term clinical outcomes of bosentan in patients with advanced HFrEF, but it was terminated before reaching the recruitment goal because of high rates of liver function abnormalities in the treatment arm. Although the study did report significant improvement in the New York Heart Association class with bosentan in the subgroup of patients who were followed up for the entire study period, it also showed a higher risk of death and HF worsening with bosentan early after treatment initiation. In the ENABLE (Endothelin Antagonist Bosentan for Lowering Cardiac Events in Heart Failure) trial, endothelin antagonism with bosentan in patients with advanced HFrEF did not improve the New York Heart Association functional class or the global clinical assessment of patients at 9 months, but resulted in early and increased fluid retention manifested as increased peripheral edema and weight gain leading to a significant increase in hospitalization for HF. Bosentan also failed to show significant improvement in systolic pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP) or tricuspid regurgitation velocity in patients with PH‐LHD in a multicenter randomized controlled trial, while showing a higher rate of serious adverse events.

### Endothelin receptor antagonists in pulmonary arterial hypertension [^1154kveZ]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2004). Low credibility.

Endothelin receptor antagonism has emerged as an important therapeutic strategy in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Laboratory and clinical investigations have clearly shown that endothelin (ET)-1 is overexpressed in several forms of pulmonary vascular disease and likely plays a significant pathogenetic role in the development and progression of pulmonary vasculopathy. Oral endothelin receptor antagonists (ERAs) have been shown to improve pulmonary hemodynamics, exercise capacity, functional status, and clinical outcome in several randomized placebo-controlled trials. Bosentan, a dual-receptor antagonist, is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for class III and IV patients with PAH, based on two phase III trials. In addition to its efficacy as sole therapy, bosentan may have a role as part of a combination of drugs such as a prostanoid or sildenafil. The selective endothelin receptor-A antagonists sitaxsentan and ambrisentan are currently undergoing investigation.

### Tadalafil therapy for pulmonary arterial hypertension [^111cqLsL]. Circulation (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Treatment options for pulmonary arterial hypertension target the prostacyclin, endothelin, or nitric oxide pathways. Tadalafil, a phosphodiesterase type-5 inhibitor, increases cGMP, the final mediator in the nitric oxide pathway.

Methods and Results

In this 16-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 405 patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (idiopathic or associated), either treatment-naive or on background therapy with the endothelin receptor antagonist bosentan, were randomized to placebo or tadalafil 2.5, 10, 20, or 40 mg orally once daily. The primary end point was the change from baseline to week 16 in the distance walked in 6 minutes. Changes in World Health Organization functional class, clinical worsening, and health-related quality of life were also assessed. Patients completing the 16-week study could enter a long-term extension study. Tadalafil increased the distance walked in 6 minutes in a dose-dependent manner; only the 40-mg dose met the prespecified level of statistical significance (P < 0.01). Overall, the mean placebo-corrected treatment effect was 33 m (95% confidence interval, 15 to 50 m). In the bosentan-naive group, the treatment effect was 44 m (95% confidence interval, 20 to 69 m) compared with 23 m (95% confidence interval, -2 to 48 m) in patients on background bosentan therapy. Tadalafil 40 mg improved the time to clinical worsening (P = 0.041), incidence of clinical worsening (68% relative risk reduction; P = 0.038), and health-related quality of life. The changes in World Health Organization functional class were not statistically significant. The most common treatment-related adverse events reported with tadalafil were headache, myalgia, and flushing.

Conclusions

In patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension, tadalafil 40 mg was well tolerated and improved exercise capacity and quality of life measures and reduced clinical worsening.

### Treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension with targeted therapies [^116acG13]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2011). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rare disorder characterized by progressive obliteration of the pulmonary microvasculature that results in elevated pulmonary vascular resistance and premature death. Although no cure exists for PAH, improved understanding of the pathobiological mechanisms of this disease has resulted in the development of effective therapies that target specific aberrant pathways. Agents that modulate abnormalities in the prostacyclin, endothelin, and nitric oxide pathways have been shown in randomized, controlled studies to confer improvements in functional status, pulmonary hemodynamics, and possibly even slow disease progression. Several additional pathways believed to play an important role in the pathogenesis of PAH have been identified as potentially useful therapeutic targets and a number of investigative approaches focusing on these targets are in active development. In this Review, we highlight the pharmacological agents currently available for the treatment of PAH and discuss potential novel strategies.

### Efficacy, safety and tolerability of bosentan in Chinese patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension [^1178ZLFh]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Bosentan has an established role in the management of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). This clinical trial assessed the benefits of bosentan in the Chinese population.

Methods

We investigated the efficacy and safety of bosentan in 92 Chinese citizens (mean ± standard deviation age, 29.0 ± 3.8 years) with PAH for a minimum of 12 weeks. All received bosentan (62.5 mg twice daily) for 4 weeks; then, patients who weighed < 40 kg received 62.5 mg bosentan twice daily and patients who weighed > 40 kg received 125 mg twice daily. All patients were eligible to continue bosentan beyond 12 weeks. The primary end point was a change in exercise capacity from baseline to 12 and 24 weeks. Secondary end points included a change in World Health Organization (WHO) functional class and changes in cardiopulmonary hemodynamics.

Results

At baseline, 66 patients (72%) were in WHO functional class III; presentation was 37 (40%) with idiopathic PAH (iPAH), 34 (37%) with PAH related to congenital heart disease (CHD), and 21 (23%) with PAH related to connective tissue disease (CTD). Exercise capacity increased to 67.8 m after 12 weeks and 92.6 m after 24 weeks (p < 0.001). After 24 weeks, WHO functional class decreased (-0.8 ± 0.6; p < 0.001), mean pulmonary artery pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance decreased (p < 0.01), and cardiac output increased (p < 0.001). Twelve patients (13%) experienced at least 1 adverse event.

Conclusions

Bosentan improved exercise capacity, functional class, and cardiopulmonary hemodynamics in this patient cohort and was well tolerated.

Specific medications of PAH

At present, the available drugs for the treatment of PAH remain reliant on differential action in 3 well-established pathways. These pathways are the antagonism of the prostacyclin and nitric oxide pathways and the antagonism of the endothelin pathway (Fig. 1). Although there is no specific drug for the treatment of PAH, modern PAH-specific treatment can improve exercise tolerance and quality of life and, in some cases, improve the time to clinical worsening and reduce mortality.

Endothelin receptor antagonists (ERAs)

Endothelin plays an important role in the pathogenesis of PAH. Endothelin-1 can competitively inhibit the binding of type A and type B endothelin receptors in pulmonary vascular smooth muscle and endothelial cells, cause vasoconstriction, promote mitosis, and participate in the occurrence and development of PAH. ERAs can treat PAH by inhibiting endothelin. At present, the main ERAs are bosentan, ambrisentan and macitentan, which selectively block the effects of ET-1 on several receptors. Bosentan, which is a dual antagonist of endothelin receptors A and B, was the first orally available medication for the treatment of PAH. It has been shown to improve exercise capacity, clinical deterioration time and various hemodynamic measures in patients with WHO FC II-IV symptoms compared with placebo. Bosentan has certain teratogenicity and hepatotoxicity, necessitating monthly assessment of liver function. Alisentan is a highly selective endothelin A receptor antagonist. Studies have shown that alisentan can significantly improve exercise tolerance and hemodynamic parameters in patients with PAH. It has less potential for hepatotoxicity than bosentan; however, it is associated with more peripheral edema. Maxitengtan is a new generation of dual ERAs with better tissue penetration and receptor affinity. A number of studies have shown that maxitengtan can significantly reduce the mortality or hospitalization rate of patients with PAH and improve 6MWD, cardiac function, quality of life, hemodynamic parameters and NT–proBNP.

Hepatic safety requires that "Dose-dependent increases in liver transaminases can occur in ~10% of treated patients (reversible after dose reduction or discontinuation)" and "liver function testing should be performed monthly in patients receiving bosentan". Drug–drug interactions are noted: "Due to pharmacokinetic interactions, bosentan may render hormonal contraceptives unreliable and lower serum levels of warfarin, sildenafil, and tadalafil".

Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) combination therapy randomized trials — iloprost, treprostinil, and sildenafil add-on — report mixed efficacy signals. The small BREATHE-2 study showed a trend to better haemodynamics for initial epoprostenol–bosentan vs epoprostenol alone. In STEP-1, adding inhaled iloprost to bosentan for 12 weeks increased post-inhalation 6-minute walk test (6MWT) by +26 m (P = 0.051) and, at pre-inhalation, placebo-corrected 6MWT by +19 m (P = 0.04), while time to clinical worsening improved with 0 events vs. 5 events in the placebo group; P = 0.02. The COMBI trial of iloprost plus bosentan was stopped prematurely after a planned futility analysis with no effect on 6 min walking distance or time to clinical worsening. In TRIUMPH, inhaled treprostinil on background bosentan or sildenafil improved peak 6MWT by 20 m (P < 0.0006) and at trough exposure after > 4 h post-inhalation by 14 m (P < 0.01); there were no significant differences in Borg dyspnoea index, functional class, and time to clinical worsening. In PACES, adding sildenafil to epoprostenol in 267 PAH patients yielded significant improvements after 12 weeks in 6MWT and time to clinical worsening, with seven deaths occurring, all in the placebo group.

### Bosentan for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension [^116bGU1H]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and safety of bosentan in the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH).

Data Sources

A MEDLINE and Current Contents search (1966-June 2002) of the English-language literature was conducted to identify published dose-ranging, pharmacokinetic, pivotal efficacy trials and review articles of bosentan and endothelin antagonists. Additional references were identified from the bibliographies of the retrieved articles.

Data Synthesis

Bosentan is the first orally active, nonpeptide endothelin receptor antagonist approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use in patients with World Health Organization (WHO) functional class III and IV PAH. Titrated to a dose of 125 mg twice daily, bosentan produces pulmonary vasodilation, improving cardiopulmonary hemodynamics leading to better outcomes for patients. It is metabolized primarily by the hepatic system via the cytochrome P450 enzyme pathway and eliminated by biliary excretion. Bosentan is an inducer of the isoenzymes CYP3A4 and 2C9. It possesses a unique pharmacokinetic profile with a terminal elimination half-life of approximately 5 hours, yet steady-state plasma concentrations are not achieved for 3–5 days as a result of enhanced drug clearance and autoinduction following multiple daily dosing. The major adverse effects of bosentan are the potential for birth defects and hepatotoxicity.

Conclusions

The use of bosentan in patients with WHO functional class III and IV PAH is associated with improved exercise tolerance, cardiopulmonary hemodynamics, and increased time to clinical worsening when compared with placebo. It offers significant advantage in ease of administration and quality of life compared with epoprostenol therapy, with similar efficacy.

Study A1481243 (NCT00323297) - REVATIO Added to Bosentan Therapy – Lack of Effect on Exercise Capacity

A randomized, double-blind, placebo‑controlled study was conducted in 103 patients with PAH who were on bosentan therapy for a minimum of 3 months. The PAH patients included those with primary PAH and PAH associated with CTD. Patients were randomized to placebo or sildenafil (20 mg three times a day) in combination with bosentan (62.5 to 125 mg twice a day). The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline at Week 12 in 6-minute walk distance (6MWD). The results indicate that there is no significant difference in mean change from baseline on 6MWD observed between sildenafil 20 mg plus bosentan and bosentan alone.

STARTS-1 (NCT00159913) - Sildenafil in Treatment-Naive Children, Aged 1 to 17 Years, with Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension

A total of 234 patients with PAH aged 1 to 17 years were treated in a randomized, double-blind, multi-center, placebo-controlled parallel group, dose-ranging study. Patients (38% male and 62% female) had body weight ≥ 8 kg and had idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (33%), or PAH associated with congenital heart disease (systemic-to-pulmonary shunt 37%, surgical repair 30%). In this trial, 27% of patients were < 7 years old. Patients were WHO Functional Class I (32%), II (51%), III (15%), or IV (0.4%).

Ambrisentan

Ambrisentan is a selective ET A R antagonist with a longer half-life than bosentan (9 h vs 5.4 h, respectively), administered orally. It is approved for the treatment of patients with PAH in WHO FC II and III in the USA, Europe and several other regions. Theoretically, selective ET A R antagonists should be more effective than dual ERAs in that they only target the vasoconstrictive and mitogenic activities of ET-1–ET A R, while preserving the vasodilatory and antimitogenic effect of ET-1–ET B R. Despite its selectivity for ET A R, ambrisentan has not shown greater efficacy in non-comparative monotherapy clinical trials, compared with bosentan. This may be because the distribution or function of ET B R is altered in disease states, and thus dual receptor blockers appear to perform as well as those ERAs with a specific target. Unlike bosentan, ambrisentan was not associated with elevated liver toxicity, but peripheral oedema was reported more frequently compared with placebo. Details of the ARIES-1 and ARIES-2 trials are given in table 3, and the ARIES-E extension study is detailed in table 4.

Macitentan

Macitentan is a dual receptor ERA, administered orally. It is approved for the treatment of PAH for the long-term treatment of WHO FC II and III patients with PAH in the USA and Europe. Macitentan was not associated with liver toxicity. Decreased haemoglobin levels have been reported more frequently in patients receiving macitentan versus placebo in randomised controlled trials. Details of the SERAPHIN study are given in table 3.

Blockade of endothelin receptors

Endothelin 1 (ET-1) is a potent vasoconstrictor and promoter of pulmonary artery smooth muscle cell proliferationwhich is upregulated in PAH. There are two ET-1 receptor subtypes: endothelin receptors A (ET A R) and B (ET B R). ET A R is highly expressed in VSMCs and contributes to ET-1-induced contraction and proliferation of VSMCs in PAH.ET B R is predominantly expressed in vascular endothelial cells where activation with ET-1 promotes vasodilation through accelerated production of PGI 2 and nitric oxide (NO) and clearance of ET-1, but is also expressed in VSMCs, where it has vasoconstrictive and proliferative actions.ET receptors are also upregulated in PAH. The dual ERAs bosentan and macitentan, and the selective ET A R antagonist ambrisentan bind and block the ET receptors, preventing ET-1-mediated responses.

Bosentan

Bosentan is a dual ERA, administered orally. It is approved for the treatment of patients with PAH in WHO FC II–IV in the USA and several other regions, and in patients in WHO FC II–III in Europe. It may be associated with increased levels of liver transaminases; therefore patients are started on a low dose, which is up-titrated to the therapeutic dose as long as liver transaminase levels remain normal. Monthly monitoring of liver transaminases is mandatory for patients taking bosentan. Details of the BREATHE-1 and EARLY studies are given in table 3.

Macitentan has been shown to be effective in patients already receiving either non-intravenous prostanoids or PDE5 inhibitors. The SERAPHIN studyinvestigated whether long-term treatment with macitentan reduced a combined endpoint of morbidity or mortality in patients with PAH as either combination or monotherapy over 3 years. Of 742 patients treated, 471 were receiving either PDE5 inhibitors (n = 454) or non-intravenous prostanoids (n = 40). Overall, there was a significant reduction in the risk of a combined endpoint event in patients receiving macitentan compared with placebo, which was driven by deterioration in PAH. The risk of a combined endpoint event for patients receiving macitentan as monotherapy was lower than for patients receiving macitentan in combination therapy. However, patients receiving combination therapy showed a significant improvement in 6MWD, whereas patients receiving macitentan monotherapy did not. Nasopharyngitis, headache and anaemia were more common in patients receiving macitentan than in those receiving placebo.

The efficacy of adding bosentan to other therapies has not been proven, despite its evaluation in several studies. In the phase IV, event-driven COMPASS-2study, 334 patients receiving sildenafil for at least 12 weeks were randomised to either placebo or bosentan. The primary endpoint of time to the first morbidity/mortality event (defined as death, hospitalisation for PAH worsening or intravenous prostanoid initiation, atrial septostomy, lung transplant, or worsening PAH) was not met, with a non-significant observed risk reduction for morbidity/mortality. Improvements were observed in secondary endpoints 6MWD and NT-proBNP. The safety profile was consistent with that of bosentan, with no new signals observed.

In a study design that was essentially a reversal of COMPASS-2, NCT00323297investigated the addition of sildenafil to the treatment of 103 patients with PAH already receiving bosentan. The trial did not meet its primary endpoint of a significant increase in 6MWD in patients treated with combined bosentan and sildenafil compared with patients treated with bosentan alone. The most common AEs in the sildenafil group were diarrhoea, headache and peripheral oedema.

Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) drug interactions — bosentan–sildenafil pharmacokinetics and endothelin receptor antagonist (ERA) comparators — outline CYP-mediated effects and clinical considerations. A pharmacokinetic interaction has been described between bosentan and sildenafil, which act as inducers or inhibitors of cytochrome P450 CYP3A4, respectively. The co-administration of both substances results in a decline of sildenafil plasma levels and in an increase in bosentan plasma levels. So far there is no indication that these interactions are associated with reduced safety, but the question of whether the clinical efficacy of sildenafil is significantly reduced is still under debate. No pharmacokinetic interactions have been reported between sildenafil and the two other available ERAs, sitaxsentan and ambrisentan. Bosentan is an inducer of cytochrome P450 isoenzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2C9.

Inhaled iloprost for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) has been studied in one RCT using daily repetitive inhalations 6–9 times at 2.5–5 μg/inhalation (median 30 μg daily) versus placebo, showing increased exercise capacity and improvements in symptoms, pulmonary vascular resistance, and clinical events; a second RCT on 60 patients on background bosentan increased exercise capacity (P < 0.01). Common adverse effects include cough, headache, flushing, and jaw pain; continuous i.v. iloprost appears to be as effective as epoprostenol in a small series, and the effects of oral iloprost have not been assessed in PAH.

Future study designs

The future decisive challenge is the identification of the most appropriate study designs to demonstrate the efficacy-to-safety ratio of combination strategies either with already approved drugs or with novel therapies. The replication of the traditional phase III strategy (placebo-controlled design in treatment-naïve patients, 6MWT as primary endpoint assessed after 3–4 months of treatment) appears not to be suitable for practical and ethical reasons. In fact, the inclusion of patients on background effective therapies will reduce our ability to demonstrate a difference between the 'placebo-treated group' and the 'actively treated group', in particular, if exercise capacity is the primary endpoint. This phenomenon was observed in the more recently completed RCTs in which the treatment effect on the 6MWT ranged from 15 to 25 m, when compared with the traditional 35 to 55 m observed in historical monotherapy studies. A possible solution is the adoption of different primary endpoints, such as TtCW, accepted by the regulatory agencies. This approach also presents challenges, including the objective and uniform definition of this composite endpoint and the sample size and/or duration of the study, which can be either pre-specified or based on the number of observed events. Additional problems of multicentre and international studies are linked to the country-related heterogeneity of the PAH-approved medications, the different attitudes for hospitalization in different geographic areas, and the availability of centres with experience in combination therapy.

Initial appropriate answers to solve these difficulties have been given by the regulatory agencies and by the investigators. In fact, in the recently published 'Guideline on the Clinical Investigations of Medicinal Products for the Treatment of PAH', the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the EMA clarified the requirements for the approval of PAH medications, indicating the characteristics of acceptable primary endpoints, including 6MWT and TtCW. Randomized controlled trials adopting novel designs and TtCW as primary endpoint have already been initiated. For example, a morbidity and mortality primary endpoint has been adopted in the SERAPHIN study (Study with Endothelin Receptor Antagonist in Pulmonary arterial Hypertension to Improve cliNical outcome), testing the efficacy of a new tissular dual endothelin receptor antagonist, and in the AMBITION study (A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre study of first-line combination therapy with AMBrIsentan and Tadalafil vs. monotherapy in subjects with pulmonary arterial hypertensION), testing the efficacy of the initial combination therapy of a selective endothelin receptor antagonist and a phosphodiesterase type-5 inhibitor when compared with monotherapy using single compounds.

Pulmonary arterial hypertension — endothelin receptor antagonists (ERAs): Endothelin-1 exerts vasoconstrictor and mitogenic effects by binding to endothelin receptors type A and B. Ambrisentan preferentially binds endothelin receptor type A, and reports note that the incidence of abnormal liver function tests ranges from 0.8 to 3%, that monthly liver function assessment is not mandated in the USA, and that an increased incidence of peripheral oedema has been reported with ambrisentan use. Bosentan, an oral dual endothelin receptor antagonist, has been associated with increases in hepatic aminotransferases in approximately 10% of patients, which were dose dependent and reversible after dose reduction or discontinuation, and liver function tests should be performed monthly in patients receiving bosentan. Macitentan was evaluated in an event-driven RCT in which 742 PAH patients received 3 mg or 10 mg for an average of 100 weeks; while no liver toxicity was shown, reduction in blood haemoglobin ≤ 8 g/dL occurred in 4.3% of patients receiving 10 mg of macitentan.

### Use of a mixed endothelin receptor antagonist in portopulmonary hypertension: a safe and effective therapy? [^115JuUBr]. Gastroenterology (2005). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Portopulmonary hypertension (PPHTN), a severe complication of portal hypertension is observed in 3%-6% of patients evaluated for liver transplantation. Endothelin-1, a potent vasoconstrictor, is likely to play a role in the pathogenesis of primary pulmonary hypertension, and, in 2 recent trials, the dual endothelin receptor antagonist bosentan has shown beneficial effects in this disease. A role for endothelins in the development of both pulmonary hypertension and cirrhosis has been suggested. We therefore hypothesized that endothelin receptor blockade may be beneficial in the treatment of PPHTN.

Methods

We report a case of a 42-year-old patient with PPHTN and alcoholic cirrhosis treated with the mixed endothelin receptor antagonist bosentan.

Results

The patient rapidly improved from NYHA IV to stage II, experienced a remarkable improvement of 6-minute walking distance from 0 to 590 m within 6 months, and resumed working full-time as a locksmith after 7 months of treatment. Improvement of cardiovascular parameters included a reduction of pulmonary vascular resistance by 60%, a decrease of mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP) from 55 to 44 mm Hg at 9 months, and a decline of plasma B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) from 339 pg/mL to 19 pg/mL after 1 year. There were no adverse events except for a transient decrease in systemic blood pressure.

Conclusions

To our knowledge, this is the first report of a patient with PPHTN treated with an endothelin receptor antagonist. The marked and sustained improvement supports the undertaking of controlled studies of the safety and efficacy of bosentan in PPHTN.

### Randomized study of adding inhaled iloprost to existing bosentan in pulmonary arterial hypertension [^1121fzTF]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Rationale

Small, open-label studies suggest that combinations of existing therapies may be effective for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH).

Objective

To evaluate the safety and efficacy of adding inhaled iloprost, a prostacyclin analog, to the endothelin receptor antagonist bosentan in patients with PAH.

Methods

In a randomized, multicenter, double-blind trial, inhaled iloprost (5 mug) or placebo was added to stable monotherapy with bosentan for 12 wk. Efficacy endpoints included change from baseline in 6-min-walk distance (6-MWD), modified New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class, hemodynamic parameters, and time to clinical worsening.

Measurements and Main Results

A total of 67 patients with PAH (55% idiopathic PAH, 45% associated PAH, 94% NYHA class III, and mean baseline 6-MWD of 335 m) were randomized. At Week 12, patients receiving iloprost had a mean increase in 6-MWD of 30 m (p = 0.001); placebo patients had a mean 6-MWD increase of 4 m (p = 0.69), with a placebo-adjusted difference of +26 m (p = 0.051). NYHA status improved by one class in 34% of iloprost versus 6% of placebo patients (p = 0.002). Iloprost delayed the time to clinical worsening (p = 0.0219). Improvements were noted in postinhalation placebo-adjusted change in mean pulmonary artery pressure (-8 mm Hg; p < 0.001) and pulmonary vascular resistance (-254 dyn x s x cm⁻⁵; p < 0.001). Combination therapy was well tolerated.

Conclusions

Within the limitations of a relatively small sample size, results of this study demonstrate that the addition of inhaled iloprost in patients with PAH with reduced exercise capacity on bosentan monotherapy is safe and efficacious.

### Phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor plus endothelin receptor antagonist compared to either alone for group 1 pulmonary arterial hypertension [^116KrdM3]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), a rare disorder, causes elevated pressure in the pulmonary arteries, leading to heart failure. Untreated PAH has a poor prognosis, emphasising the need for effective intervention. Pharmacological treatment includes pulmonary vasodilators such as endothelin receptor antagonists (ERA), prostacyclin analogues, phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (PDE5i), and soluble guanylate cyclase stimulators, often used together to improve symptoms and quality of life while reducing mortality and risk of hospitalisation.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of combination therapy involving a phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor (PDE5i) and an endothelin receptor antagonist (ERA) in adults and adolescents with group 1 pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) compared to either agent alone.

Search Methods

We searched Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Scopus, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform for randomised controlled trials (RCTs). The most recent searches were conducted on 13 March 2024.

Eligibility Criteria

We included published and unpublished RCTs comparing combinations of ERAs and PDE5is versus either agent alone lasting at least 12 weeks. Participants were aged 12 years or older with WHO group 1 PAH meeting specific haemodynamic criteria. We excluded cluster-, cross-over, and quasi-RCTs, and other PAH-specific medications.

Outcomes

Critical outcomes were clinical worsening, mortality, and hospitalisation. Important outcomes were changes in six-minute walk distance (6MWD), WHO functional class, Borg Dyspnea Scale, serious adverse events, and withdrawal from the trial.

Risk Of Bias

Two review authors independently assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane RoB 2 tool. We resolved disagreements through discussion or consultation. This informed GRADE ratings and summary of findings tables.

Synthesis Methods

We used a random-effects model to address study differences, switching to a fixed-effect model if there was variation primarily due to random error. We conducted meta-analyses if deemed meaningful, with data pooled if treatments, participants, and clinical questions were sufficiently similar.

Included Studies

We included nine studies with 1807 participants. The median duration of the studies was 16 weeks, ranging from 12 to 129 weeks. Treatment regimens included combinations of medications such as ambrisentan, bosentan, macitentan, tadalafil, and sildenafil.

Synthesis Of Results

Combination therapy versus endothelin receptor antagonist Combination therapy reduces clinical worsening compared to ERA alone (risk ratio (RR) 0.53, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.41 to 0.68; 113 fewer per 1000 participants, 95% CI 141 fewer to 77 fewer; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial effect (NNTB) 9, 95% CI 7 to 13; 5 trials, 1139 participants; high-certainty evidence). Hospitalisation is likely reduced (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.55; 70 fewer per 1000 participants, 95% CI 83 fewer to 46 fewer; NNTB 14, 95% CI 12 to 22; moderate-certainty evidence). Combination therapy may result in little to no difference in mortality (low-certainty evidence), and a clinically negligible improvement in 6MWD (mean difference (MD) 19.4 m, 95% CI 10.5 to 28.3; moderate-certainty evidence). There was little to no change in Borg Dyspnea Scale (low-certainty evidence). The evidence for WHO functional class was very uncertain. There may be little to no difference in serious adverse events and trial withdrawals between the groups (low-certainty evidence). Combination therapy versus phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of combination treatment on clinical worsening compared to PDE5i alone (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.33 to 1.39; 142 fewer per 1000 participants, 95% CI 298 fewer to 173 more; 4 trials, 1372 participants; very low-certainty evidence), although exclusion of high-bias studies suggested a potential benefit (RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.73). The evidence on hospitalisations was very uncertainty, while there was little to no difference in mortality (low-certainty evidence). There was a clinically negligible improvement in 6MWD (MD 20.4 m, 95% CI 10.7 to 30.2; moderate-certainty evidence) and little to no change in Borg Dyspnea Scale (low-certainty evidence). The evidence for WHO functional class was very uncertain. Serious adverse events may be comparable (low-certainty evidence). Combination therapy reduces withdrawal from the trial compared to PDE5i alone (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.99; 64 fewer per 1000 participants, 95% CI 117 fewer to 4 fewer; NNTB 16, 95% CI 9 to 250; low-certainty evidence). Phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor versus endothelin receptor antagonist PDE5i likely results in little to no difference in clinical worsening compared to ERA (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.20; 3 trials, 644 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). The evidence is very uncertain for mortality and hospitalisation. PDE5i results in little to no difference in 6MWD compared to ERA (MD 18.4 m, 95% CI -50.2 to 86.9; low-certainty evidence). The impact on WHO functional class worsening, serious adverse events, and trial withdrawal was also uncertain, with all outcomes supported by very low- or low-certainty evidence. Overall, current data do not provide reliable conclusions on the relative efficacy or safety of PDE5i versus ERA.

Authors' Conclusions

Combination therapy for PAH offers benefits over monotherapies, reducing clinical worsening compared to ERA alone (high certainty). Their benefits over PDE5i are less certain, although potentially favourable when studies at high risk of bias are excluded. Hospitalisation rates are likely reduced with combination therapy compared to ERA, but the effect is very uncertain when combination therapy is compared to PDE5i. Uncertainty also persists regarding its impact on mortality and functional outcomes, such as 6MWD and WHO functional class. Serious adverse events and withdrawal rates are similar between combination therapy and monotherapies, with varying levels of certainty, although withdrawals may favour combination therapy over PDE5i. Comparative analyses of PDE5i and ERA provided mixed results with varying levels of certainty. These findings could inform whether initial combination therapy should become the standard of care in people with group 1 PAH with WHO functional class levels of II or III. However, the review's limited representation of Black people raises concerns about generalisability, given the observed differences in response to ERAs between Black and White people with PAH in the literature.

### Bosentan therapy for pulmonary arterial hypertension [^111hjNbD]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2002). Excellent credibility.

Background

Endothelin-1 is a potent vasoconstrictor and smooth-muscle mitogen. In a preliminary study, the orally administered dual endothelin-receptor antagonist bosentan improved exercise capacity and cardiopulmonary hemodynamics in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension. The present trial investigated the effect of bosentan on exercise capacity in a larger number of patients and compared two doses.

Methods

In this double-blind, placebo-controlled study, we randomly assigned 213 patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (primary or associated with connective-tissue disease) to receive placebo or to receive 62.5 mg of bosentan twice daily for 4 weeks followed by either of two doses of bosentan (125 or 250 mg twice daily) for a minimum of 12 weeks. The primary end point was the degree of change in exercise capacity. Secondary end points included the change in the Borg dyspnea index, the change in the World Health Organization (WHO) functional class, and the time to clinical worsening.

Results

At week 16, patients treated with bosentan had an improved six-minute walking distance; the mean difference between the placebo group and the combined bosentan groups was 44 m (95 percent confidence interval, 21 to 67; P < 0.001). Bosentan also improved the Borg dyspnea index and WHO functional class and increased the time to clinical worsening.

Conclusions

The endothelin-receptor antagonist bosentan is beneficial in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension and is well tolerated at a dose of 125 mg twice daily. Endothelin-receptor antagonism with oral bosentan is an effective approach to therapy for pulmonary arterial hypertension.

### Inhibition of endothelin receptors in the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension: does selectivity matter? [^115yDHQm]. European Heart Journal (2008). Low credibility.

Treatment options for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) have considerably improved in the past few years. Endothelin (ET)-receptor antagonism has been established as a first-line option for the majority of PAH patients. Endothelin-receptor antagonists (ETRAs) comprise sulfonamide and non-sulfonamide agents with different affinities for ET-receptor subtypes (ET A and ET B), and the focus of development has shifted from drugs with less selectivity to those with high selectivity. There is ongoing debate as to whether selective or non-selective ET-receptor antagonism is more beneficial in the treatment of PAH. This paper reviews the current evidence from experimental and clinical studies obtained from a thorough literature search focusing on the three marketed drugs bosentan, sitaxentan, and ambrisentan. A clinically meaningful difference among the three approved ETRAs with respect to their ET-receptor selectivity could not be demonstrated to date. Therefore, in clinical practice, other features are likely to be of greater relevance when considering treatment, such as the potential for serious drug–drug interactions, convenience of dosing schedule, or rates of limiting side effects. These characteristics bear more relation to the chemical or pharmacological properties of the drugs than to receptor selectivity itself.

### Combining inhaled iloprost with bosentan in patients with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension [^115QtSty]. The European Respiratory Journal (2006). Low credibility.

Addition of inhaled iloprost to bosentan may have beneficial effects in patients with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH). A multicentre, open, randomised, controlled trial was performed to assess the safety and efficacy of inhaled iloprost in patients with IPAH who had already been treated with bosentan. The trial was terminated early after a futility analysis predicted failure with respect to the predetermined sample size. At that time, 40 patients were randomised to receive either bosentan alone (control group) or bosentan plus inhaled iloprost (combination group) for a 12-week period. The primary end-point, change in 6-min walking distance, was not met (mean changes +1 m and -9 m in the control and combination group, respectively). These results may have been skewed by three outliers in the iloprost group who presented with severe clinical worsening. None of the secondary end-points including functional class, peak oxygen uptake, and time to clinical worsening differed significantly between groups. The current study failed to show a positive effect of adding inhaled iloprost to bosentan in idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension patients. Further studies involving larger sample sizes and long-term follow-up are needed to determine the efficacy of adding inhaled iloprost to bosentan in patients with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension.

### Evidence synthesis in pulmonary arterial hypertension: a systematic review and critical appraisal [^116YXM5u]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rare and debilitating chronic disease of the pulmonary vasculature. Disease progression is characterized by increasing pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) and non-specific symptoms (e.g. dyspnoea during exercise, fatigue, chest pain, and light-headedness), that ultimately leads to right heart failure and premature death. Prior to the availability of PAH-specific therapies, median survival time was documented as 2.8 years in the US patients with PAH. Five-year survival rate in newly diagnosed patients is reported to be 61.2%.

Therapies in PAH have been approved with one or more routes of administration for three key pathogenesis pathways. Approved therapies targeting the nitric oxide pathway are the phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors (PDE-5I): sildenafil (oral or intravenous [IV]) and tadalafil (oral), and the soluble guanylate cyclase stimulator (sGCS) riociguat (oral). Therapies targeting the endothelin pathway currently approved are macitentan, bosentan and ambrisentan, all administered orally. One of the endothelin receptor antagonist (ERA) drugs, sitaxentan, was authorised in Europe in 2006, but subsequently withdrawn due to liver toxicity. Approved drugs targeting the prostacyclin [PGI2] pathway include epoprostenol (IV), iloprost (inhaled), treprostinil (IV, inhaled, oral, subcutaneous [SC]), beraprost (oral), and selexipag (oral), a selective non-prostanoid PGI2 receptor (IP receptor) agonist.

### Endothelin receptor antagonists for pulmonary arterial hypertension [^115qHgvv]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a devastating disease, which leads to right heart failure and premature death. Pulmonary arterial hypertension can be classified into five categories according to Venice classification: (1) Idiopathic PAH; (2) Familial PAH; (3) PAH associated with collagen vascular disease, congenital systemic-to-pulmonary shunts, portal hypertension, HIV infection, drugs and toxins or other (thyroid disorders, glycogen storage disease, Gaucher disease, hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, hemoglobinopathies, myeloproliferative disorders, splenectomy); (4) PAH associated with significant venous or capillary involvement, which includes pulmonary veno-occlusive disease (PVOD) and pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis (PCH); (5) Persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn. PAH can also be secondary to chronic hypoxic lung disease as part of the "cor-pulmonale" syndrome, and also secondary to left sided heart disease, but these conditions are usually distinguished from those listed here.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy of endothelin receptor antagonists in pulmonary arterial hypertension.

Search Strategy

A search was carried out using the CENTRAL (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials), MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the reference section of retrieved articles. Searches are current as of August 2005.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-randomised controlled trials involving patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) were selected by two reviewers.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently selected studies; assessed study quality; and extracted data. We analysed outcomes as continuous and dichotomous data.

Main Results

In this updated version of the review, we added two RCTs. Altogether, five RCTs met the entry criteria of the review (reporting eight group comparisons). The studies were of short duration (12–16 weeks), recruiting a total of 482 participants. Three studies compared a non-selective ERA (bosentan) with placebo, one compared bosentan with sildenafil (a phosphodiesterase inhibitor), and one compared a selective ERA (sitaxsentan) with placebo. Over a 12–16 week period ERAs improved exercise capacity, improve Borg dyspnoea score, some measures of cardiopulmonary haemodynamics (pulmonary artery pressure, pulmonary vascular resistance, and cardiac index) in symptomatic patients with mainly idiopathic PAH. The effect of ERAs on mortality was not significant. The most severe side effect, hepatic toxicity, was not common.

Authors' Conclusions

ERAs in conjunction with conventional therapy over 12 to 16 weeks can improve exercise capacity, Borg dyspnoea scores and several cardiopulmonary haemodynamics variables in patients mainly with idiopathic PAH. The data on mortality do not currently show a benefit of this class of drugs on this endpoint. Additional assessment of this outcome is important in order to establish whether there is evidence that ERAs have an impact on the risk of death. Longer studies are required.

### Pharmacologic therapy for pulmonary arterial hypertension in adults: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^1111Hoot]. Chest (2014). Medium credibility.

Bosentan — randomized trials in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) adults — showed improved exercise capacity and hemodynamics with mixed effects on clinical worsening. In one study, 6-minute walk distance (6MWD) among bosentan-treated patients was 44 m greater than placebo (95% CI, 21–67 m; P < .001) over 28 weeks, with two deaths (3%) in placebo vs 1 [1%] with bosentan (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.23; 95% CI, 0.02–2.63) and fewer combined hospitalization/worsening PAH events (nine occurrences (13%) vs six occurrences (4%); HR = 0.29; 95% CI, 0.10–0.85). In WHO FC III Eisenmenger syndrome, 54 patients were randomized 2:1 to bosentan (n = 37) or placebo (n = 17) for 16 weeks; bosentan decreased pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) index (−472.0 dyn/s/cm⁵, P = 0.04), reduced mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP) (−5.5 mm Hg, P = 0.04), and increased 6MWD (53.1 m, P = 0.008). In a WHO FC II cohort, 93 were randomized to bosentan and 92 to placebo, with 14 (15%) and 15 (16%) receiving concomitant sildenafil; after 6 months the mean 6MWD (N = 177) changed by 11.2 m (95% CI, −4.6 to 27.0 m) with bosentan vs −7.9 m (95% CI, −24.3 to 8.5) with placebo, yielding a mean treatment effect of 19.1 m (95% CI, 3.6–41.8; p = 0.08). At month 6, mean PVR (N = 168) was 83.2% (95% CI, 73.8–93.7) of baseline with bosentan and 107.5% (95% CI, 97.6–118.4) with placebo (treatment effect, −22.6%; 95% CI, −33.5 to −10.0; P < .0001). Death and hospitalization at 6 months showed one death (1%) in each group (HR = 0.29; 95% CI, 0.06–1.065) and hospitalizations of one patient (1%) vs three patients (3%) (HR = 0.32; 95% CI, 0.03–3.16). Adverse events included abnormal liver function tests, peripheral edema, palpitations, and chest pain, and monthly monitoring of liver function tests is required for patients receiving bosentan therapy.

### Repurposing medications for treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension: what's old is new again [^11463qu8]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Although there have been significant gains in the understanding of the pathophysiology of PAH in recent years, advances in PAH therapeutics have not kept pace, and many promising basic science discoveries have not been tested in patients. Approved PAH medications are predominately pulmonary vasodilators that modulate the endothelin, nitric oxide, and prostacyclin pathways. 34 These therapies primarily address the vasoconstrictive phenotype of PAH, which is the predominant feature in only 5% to 10% of patients 35 or those patients deemed vasoresponders. 36 Although current medications provide benefits to nearly all PAH patients even if they are not vasoresponders, they were approved because they significantly increase exercise capacity (6‐minute walk distance [6MWD]), improve quality of life, and/or reduce morbidity 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45; however, only epoprostenol confers a clear survival benefit. 46 Consequently, there is an urgent need to develop novel, effective therapies that target additional molecular pathways that drive the pathogenesis of PAH in order to supplement our current treatment options with the hopes of accelerating progress toward a cure.

Current treatments

The currently available medical treatments for pulmonary arterial hypertension target the three main pathways involved in the control of pulmonary vascular tone and proliferation: prostacyclin pathway, with prostacyclin analogues and prostacyclin receptor agonists (epoprostenol, treprostinil, iloprost, selexipag) that induce vasodilation by increasing levels of cyclic AMP; nitric oxide pathway, targeted by phosphodiesterase inhibitors (sildenafil, tadalafil) and by the guanylate cyclase activator, riociguat; and endothelin pathway, targeted by receptor antagonists (bosentan, ambrisentan, macitentan). These drug treatments, or a combination of treatments, such as tadalafil and ambrisentan in the AMBITION (A Study of First-Line Ambrisentan and Tadalafil Combination Therapy in Subjects With Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension) trial, are the mainstay of treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension, and have been shown to benefit patients through improvements in exercise capacity, quality of life, and time to clinical worsening. Survival benefit has only been found with epoprostenol, although meta-analyses and post hoc survival analyses have suggested survival benefit from upfront combination dual or triple treatment. Riociguat is the only approved medical treatment for group 4 pulmonary hypertension, and has been shown to improve exercise capacity and haemodynamic variables in patients with inoperable or recurrent chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension.

Pulmonary artery thromboendarterectomy is the treatment of choice for chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension. Balloon pulmonary angioplasty can be used in inoperable cases. Recently, inhaled treprostinil became the only treatment approved by the FDA for patients with group 3 pulmonary hypertension after the drug was shown to improve exercise capacity in patients with pulmonary hypertension caused by interstitial lung disease. Recent guidelines and reviews provide a detailed overview of the treatment strategies for pulmonary hypertension.

### Treatment of patients with mildly symptomatic pulmonary arterial hypertension with bosentan (EARLY study): a double-blind, randomised controlled trial [^114FuFJK]. Lancet (2008). Excellent credibility.

Background

Treatments for pulmonary arterial hypertension have been mainly studied in patients with advanced disease (WHO functional class [FC] III and IV). This study was designed to assess the effect of the dual endothelin receptor antagonist bosentan in patients with WHO FC II pulmonary arterial hypertension.

Methods

Patients with WHO FC II pulmonary arterial hypertension aged 12 years or over with 6-min walk distance of less than 80% of the normal predicted value or less than 500 m associated with a Borg dyspnoea index of 2 or greater were enrolled in this double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre trial. 185 patients were randomly assigned to receive bosentan (n = 93) or placebo (n = 92) for the 6-month double-blind treatment period via a centralised integrated voice recognition system. Primary endpoints were pulmonary vascular resistance at month 6 expressed as percentage of baseline and change from baseline to month 6 in 6-min walk distance. Analyses of the primary endpoints were done with all randomised patients who had a valid baseline assessment and an assessment or an imputed value for month 6. This trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00091715.

Findings

Analyses were done with 168 patients (80 in the bosentan group, 88 in the placebo group) for pulmonary vascular resistance and with 177 (86 and 91) for 6-min walking distance. At month 6, geometric mean pulmonary vascular resistance was 83.2% (95% CI 73.8–93.7) of the baseline value in the bosentan group and 107.5% (97.6–118.4) of the baseline value in the placebo group (treatment effect -22.6%, 95% CI -33.5 to -10.0; p < 0.0001). Mean 6-min walk distance increased from baseline in the bosentan group (11.2 m, 95% CI -4.6 to 27.0) and decreased in the placebo group (-7.9 m, -24.3 to 8.5), with a mean treatment effect of 19.1 m (95% CI 3.6–41.8; p = 0.0758). 12 (13%) patients in the bosentan group and eight (9%) in the placebo group reported serious adverse events, the most common of which were syncope in the bosentan group and right ventricular failure in the placebo group.

Interpretation

Bosentan treatment could be beneficial for patients with WHO FC II pulmonary arterial hypertension.

### Drug-drug interactions in the management of patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension [^115WdHc9]. Chest (2022). Medium credibility.

The Endothelin Pathway: Bosentan, Ambrisentan, and Macitentan

Endothelin receptor antagonists (ERAs) competitively inhibit endothelin 1 to decrease pulmonary vascular resistance. Endothelin 1 is a potent vasoconstrictor that also mediates cell proliferation, fibrosis, and inflammation. Endothelin 1 binds to endothelin receptor A (ET A), which leads to pulmonary vasoconstriction and smooth muscle cell proliferation, and endothelin receptor B (ET B), which reduces endothelin 1 and induces endothelial cell vasodilation via NO and prostacyclin release.ERAs differ in selectivity between ET A and ET B receptors. Ambrisentan shows 100 times greater selectivity for ET A than ET B. Bosentan and macitentan are considered nonselective for the ET A and ET B receptors, with bosentan being 20 times more selective for ET A than ET B and macitentan being 50 times more selective for ET A than ET B. ERAs block the activation of ET A and ET B receptors on endothelial or smooth muscle cells and inhibit the vasoconstriction and cellular proliferation mediated by endothelin 1.

Of the three available ERAs, bosentan has the most potential for adverse events resulting from drug-drug interactions because of its side effect profile and multiple metabolism mechanisms via CYP450 isoenzymes (Table 2). Elevations in liver aminotransferase levels more than three times the upper limit of normal have been observed with bosentan use because of active transport into the liver via OATP transporters. Other drugs with known hepatotoxicity should be used with caution, especially glyburide, which is contraindicated with bosentan because of an increased risk of liver enzyme elevations. Bosentan is metabolized by CYP3A4 and CYP2C9; therefore, other medications that affect these enzymes through inhibition or induction will affect bosentan levels. Cyclosporine, a CYP3A4, and OATP inhibitor, substantially increases bosentan plasma concentrations, and concomitant use is contraindicated. Combinations of a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor, a CYP2C9 inhibitor, or both with bosentan likely will cause a significant increase in plasma bosentan levels and are not recommended. Notably, bosentan also is an inducer of CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 and can reduce plasma concentrations of coadministered drugs metabolized by these isoenzymes. Patients taking oral hormonal contraceptives, which commonly are CYP3A4 substrates, should be advised of possible decreased contraceptive efficacy, especially considering the teratogenic properties of bosentan. Warfarin is a CYP2C9 substrate; however, therapeutic doses of bosentan did not cause clinically relevant changes in international normalized ratio when used together.

### Treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension with the selective endothelin – A receptor antagonist sitaxsentan [^116h5xEc]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2006). Low credibility.

Objectives

We sought to determine the optimal dose of the selective endothelin A (ET(A)) receptor antagonist sitaxsentan for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH); for observation only, an open-label (OL) bosentan arm was included.

Background

Endothelin is a mediator of PAH. In a preliminary PAH study, the selective ET(A) receptor antagonist sitaxsentan improved six-min walk (6MW) distance, World Health Organization (WHO) functional class (FC), and hemodynamics.

Methods

In this double-blind, placebo-controlled 18-week study, 247 PAH patients (idiopathic, or associated with connective tissue disease or congenital heart disease) were randomized; 245 patients were treated: placebo (n = 62), sitaxsentan 50 mg (n = 62) or 100 mg (n = 61), or OL (6MW tests, Borg dyspnea scores, and WHO FC assessments third-party blind) bosentan (n = 60). The primary end point was change in 6MW distance from baseline to week 18. Secondary end points included change in WHO FC, time to clinical worsening, and change in Borg dyspnea score.

Results

At week 18, patients treated with sitaxsentan 100 mg had an increased 6MW distance compared with the placebo group (31.4 m, p = 0.03), and an improved WHO FC (p = 0.04). The placebo-subtracted treatment effect for sitaxsentan 50 mg was 24.2 m (p = 0.07) and for OL bosentan, 29.5 m (p = 0.05). The incidence of elevated hepatic transaminases (> 3x the upper limit of normal) was 6% for placebo, 5% for sitaxsentan 50 mg, 3% for sitaxsentan 100 mg, and 11% for bosentan.

Conclusions

Treatment with the selective ET(A) receptor antagonist sitaxsentan, orally once daily at a dose of 100 mg, improves exercise capacity and WHO FC in PAH patients, with a low incidence of hepatic toxicity.

Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) initial therapy — treatment‑naive adults with World Health Organization functional class (WHO FC) II or WHO FC III without evidence of rapid disease progression or poor prognosis: For WHO FC II, the branch "Is the patient willing or able to tolerate combination therapy?" directs Yes to "Combination therapy with ambrisentan and tadalafil (Recommendation 10: weak recommendation, moderate quality evidence)" and No to "Monotherapy with either bosentan, macitentan, ambrisentan, riociguat, sildenafil, or tadalafil (See Box 1)". For WHO FC III without evidence of rapid disease progression or poor prognosis, the branch "Is the patient willing and able to tolerate combination therapy?" directs Yes to "Combination therapy with ambrisentan and tadalafil (Recommendation 10: weak recommendation, moderate quality evidence)" and No to "Monotherapy with either bosentan, macitentan, ambrisentan, riociguat, sildenafil, or tadalafil (See Box 2)". The figure notes "there is no comparative effectiveness data to suggest greater benefit of one therapy over the other", and explains that combination therapy "carries with it costs as well as multiple medications, including the potential for increased adverse events", so when patients are unwilling or unable to tolerate it "the panel suggests monotherapy".

### Evidence-based pharmacologic management of pulmonary arterial hypertension [^116LKmCx]. Clinical Therapeutics (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a debilitating chronic disorder of the pulmonary vasculature characterized by elevated mean pulmonary arterial pressure, right-sided heart failure, and early mortality.

Objectives

This paper reviews the available information on PAH, including its pathophysiology, classification of its severity, current treatment options, drug interactions, pharmacokinetics, and cost considerations. The results of clinical trials of the available treatments are summarized, and a suggested treatment algorithm is provided as a guide to the medical management of PAH.

Methods

Pertinent articles were identified by a search of MEDLINE through May 2007 using the terms primary pulmonary hypertension, pulmonary arterial hypertension, prostacyclin, pulmonary vasodilators, endothelin-receptor antagonists, and phosphodiesterase inhibitors. Trials with prospective, randomized designs were given precedence, and prospective studies having nonrandomized, open-label designs or using historical controls were included if they contributed useful knowledge. Retrospective studies were not included.

Results

In two 12-week, randomized, open-label trials in patients with moderate to severe PAH (N = 81 and N = 111), exercise capacity, measured on the 6-minute walk test (6-MWT), was significantly improved with intravenous epoprostenol compared with conventional therapy (+31 vs -29 m, respectively, in one study [P = 0.002]; +46 vs -48 m in the other [P < 0.001]). In one of these trials, intravenous epoprostenol also was associated with a significant survival benefit (P < 0.003). In a 12-week, randomized, doubleblind, placebo-controlled trial in 470 patients with moderate to severe PAH, subcutaneous treprostinil plus conventional therapy was associated with a significant improvement on the 6-MWT compared with conventional therapy alone (+10 vs 0 m, respectively; P = 0.006). In a 16-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 213 patients with mild to moderate symptoms, the oral endothelin-receptor antagonist bosentan was associated with a significant improvement on the 6-MWT compared with placebo (+36 vs -8 m, respectively; P ≤ 0.001) and significantly less clinical worsening at 28 weeks (9/144 vs 14/69; P = 0.002). In a 12-week, prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 277 patients with PAH, sildenafil 20, 40, and 80 mg TID were associated with significant improvements on the 6-MWT compared with placebo (all, P < 0.001). In a prospective trial in 76 patients with idiopathic PAH, the inhaled prostacyclin iloprost was associated with overall survival rates of 93%, 79%, 70%, 59%, 59%, and 49% at 3 months and 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years, respectively. In an early trial in 64 patients receiving highdose calcium channel blockers, those who had responded to initial drug challenge (defined as a > 20% decrease in pulmonary arterial pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance immediately after challenge) had a survival rate of 94% at 1, 3, and 5 years.

Conclusions

Patients who respond to an acute trial of a vasodilator may be treated with an oral calcium channel blocker, whereas oral therapies such as sildenafil and bosentan have been effective in patients with mild to moderate symptoms. Infusions of the prostacyclin analogues epoprostenol and treprostinil appear to be the treatment of choice for moderate to severe PAH, and agents with alternate routes of delivery such as inhaled iloprost may be advantageous in adjunctive roles. Future trials that focus on the long-term effects of currently available agents, as well as on combination therapy, are needed.

### Endothelin receptor antagonists for pulmonary arterial hypertension [^114FCNNw]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a devastating disease, which leads to right heart failure and premature death. Pulmonary arterial hypertension can be classified into two categories: 1) sporadic primary pulmonary hypertension (PPH) or familial PPH and 2) PAH secondary to collagen vascular diseases, congenital systemic to pulmonary shunts, portal hypertension, HIV infection, drugs or toxins, and persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn. They have identical pathologic features, a similar clinical course. Endothelin receptor antagonists (ERAs) are a class of potent vasodilators, which could specifically dilate the pulmonary arterial system.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy of endothelin receptor antagonists in pulmonary arterial hypertension.

Search Strategy

A search was carried out using the CENTRAL (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials), MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the reference section of retrieved articles. Searches are current as of August 2004.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-randomised controlled trials involving patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) were selected by two reviewers.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently selected studies; assessed study quality; and extracted data. We analysed outcomes as continuous and dichotomous data.

Main Results

We identified three RCTs of short duration (12–16 weeks), recruiting a total of 423 participants. Two studies compared a non-selective ERA (bosentan) with placebo and one compared a selective ERA (sitaxsentan) with placebo. Over a 12–16 week period ERAs improved exercise capacity, improve Borg dyspnoea score, some measures of cardiopulmonary haemodynamics (pulmonary artery pressure, pulmonary vascular resistance, and cardiac index) in symptomatic patients with PAH. The most severe side effect, hepatic toxicity, was not common.

Authors' Conclusions

ERAs in conjunction with conventional therapy over 16 weeks can improve exercise capacity, Borg dyspnoea scores and several cardiopulmonary haemodynamics variables in PAH patients. Longer studies are required.

Bosentan added to sildenafil in symptomatic pulmonary arterial hypertension — event-driven randomized trial and guideline stance: Patients on stable sildenafil at ≥ 20 mg three times daily for at least 3 months were randomized to receive placebo or bosentan at 62.5 mg twice daily for 1 month followed by 125 mg twice daily; three hundred and thirty-four patients were randomized overall, and the between-group mean difference for 6MWD was 21.8 m (95% CI, 5.9–37.8; p = 0.0106) favoring bosentan, which was less than the MID (33 m), with no differences identified in other outcomes of interest, and there is currently insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for or against the addition of bosentan to patients on sildenafil.

Endothelin receptor antagonists

Bosentan

Endothelin-1 is a vasoconstrictor which is overproduced in the pulmonary vasculature of patients with PAH; overexpression of endothelin results in increased PVR and obstruction of pulmonary blood flow. ERAs, such as bosentan, prevent endothelin-1 from binding to its receptors. ERAs are commonly used to treat patients with PAH. To date, bosentan is the most well-studied drug used in the treatment of PAH-CHD.

Two small, short-term studies supported the use of bosentan in patients with PAH-CHD. Each study observed 10 patients over the course of 3–4 months and found that bosentan improved 6MWD by 9.21%and 39.76%. One study also reported that WHO FC improved in 50% of patients and remained stable in the other 50%. Two patients experienced serious adverse events requiring hospitalisation in one study (peripheral oedema related to bosentan use and hypoglycaemia unrelated to bosentan use). The other study reported transient peripheral oedema in four patients, but no serious adverse events.

Larger studies on the use of bosentan for up to 1 year of treatment or longer also reported encouraging results, with improvements in 6MWD ranging between 8.49% and 43.66% and improvements in PVR between 23.98% and 36.36%. One study by Kotlyar et al did note that 6MWD only improved among their patients who were naive to prior treatment with PAH-specific medications, while those patients who were already receiving some form of therapy did not experience any significant improvement in 6MWD. Most studies also reported a significant improvement in WHO FC in many patients, with only one patient experiencing a worsening of WHO FC. Among these studies, four patients discontinued bosentan due to peripheral oedema, four discontinued due to elevated LFTs, two discontinued due to perceived lack of improvementand two died (one due to worsening PAH, and the other due to progressive heart failure in a patient with 'single ventricle' physiology).

Clinical trials in pulmonary arterial hypertension patients

ETRAs have been studied in numerous open and several controlled clinical trials in patients with PAH. The differences between the three approved drugs may be because of ET-receptor selectivity, but also linked to other properties, such as pharmacokinetics or drug–drug interactions. Table 2 provides an overview of the pharmacological properties of the three available ETRAs. Patient characteristics and outcomes of the pivotal studies of each agent are shown in Table 3 and discussed below.

### New strategies for the conduct of clinical trials in pediatric pulmonary arterial hypertension: outcome of a multistakeholder meeting with patients, academia, industry, and regulators, held at the European medicines agency on monday, June 12, 2017 [^116vnfNy]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Table 2
Summary of Efficacy End Points Used to Obtain Regulatory Approval of Medicines for Use in PAH for Adults and Children

Pharmacokinetic and safety data cannot be extrapolated from adults and would need to be assessed in the pediatric population.

On the basis of the data presented at the meeting and existing knowledge at the time of the workshop, there was consensus among stakeholders that our understanding of the pathophysiological features of various PAH subgroups is still insufficient to draw detailed comparison between those seen in the adult versus the child, and consequently to extrapolate efficacy as a general rule.

A positive example in which progress has been made through adequate data collection over the past years and in which existing knowledge can translate in facilitating regulatory requirements is idiopathic PAH and some forms of associated PAH in adults and children, making progress toward extrapolation of efficacy possible. Such progress has been integrated by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, which is the European Medicines Agency's committee responsible for human medicines in the pediatric addendum to its guideline on the clinical investigations of medicinal products for the treatment of PAH. Such an agreement means that there would no longer always be the necessity to run studies in which the main aim is to confirm clinical benefits, and it might not necessarily be required to conduct placebo‐controlled trials. Placebo control can lead to recruitment issues, even for short‐term placebo withdrawal studies, as particularly highlighted by the patient's representatives. The use of extrapolation of efficacy from adults to children could allow pediatric licensing on the basis of studies evaluating pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and safety in the pediatric population. 25 For classes of products already authorized, and with appropriate end points, adult and pediatric PAH clinical programs may proceed simultaneously, leading to timely access for children. To date, only bosentan has obtained a claim for use in the pediatric population on the basis of an extrapolation approach in the United States. During the meeting, stakeholders agreed that pharmacokinetics data alone (ie, matching blood concentrations in pediatric patients with PAH to those achieved in adult patients with PAH) would not be sufficient for extrapolation. There is the need to confirm the adequate doses with pharmacodynamics end points. Studies focusing on pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics may not need a control arm of another medicinal compound or placebo, but could be dose controlled with at least 3 doses to characterize the dose‐response curve. Further considerations to the pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics study design will need to be developed, particularly paying careful attention to pediatric clinical pharmacological features early in study design, which can also help to optimize initial dose selection and data sampling.
