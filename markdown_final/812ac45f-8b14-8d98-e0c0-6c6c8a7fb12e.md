## Question

Forester classification

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the Forrester classification. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about which "Forrester" classification is intended, because there are two distinct systems with similar names. Then, I should verify the original purpose, framework, and prognostic value of the correct system. Next, I will examine how it has been adapted or validated in contemporary practice, including noninvasive applications. After that, I should compare it with alternative or complementary tools and note limitations. Finally, I will synthesize practical clinical implications and ensure the references align with each claim I make.

> Let me first confirm the ambiguity: there is a Forrest classification for peptic ulcer bleeding and a Forrester classification for hemodynamic profiling after myocardial infarction. Given the context of hemodynamics and prognostication, the user most likely means the Forrester hemodynamic classification rather than the Forrest endoscopic bleeding classification, so I will proceed with the hemodynamic Forrester model and keep the Forrest ulcer system in mind only for contrast and completeness [^112AdErq] [^113c33B3].

> I will now examine the origin and purpose. The Forrester classification was developed in 1976 to categorize patients after acute myocardial infarction into four hemodynamic profiles based on two axes: the presence or absence of pulmonary congestion and the presence or absence of adequate peripheral perfusion, yielding warm-dry, wet-warm, dry-cold, and wet-cold profiles that correlate with short-term mortality and guide therapy selection [^113c33B3].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about prognostic strength without checking the data. Multiple cohorts show a stepwise increase in mortality as hemodynamics worsen from Profile I to IV, with particularly poor outcomes in wet-cold patients; for example, in a thrombolytic-era series, short-term survival ranged from 95.6% in Profile I to 34.8% in Profile IV, and long-term survival showed a similar gradient, confirming robust prognostic discrimination by clinical subset at presentation [^116qgbAy].

> Next, I should review the original framework details to ensure I'm precise. Profile I is warm and dry (no congestion, no hypoperfusion), Profile II is wet and warm (congestion without hypoperfusion), Profile III is dry and cold (hypoperfusion without congestion), and Profile IV is wet and cold (both congestion and hypoperfusion); this simple 2×2 matrix operationalizes bedside assessment of JVP, lungs, and extremities to assign patients and anticipate risk and response to diuretics versus inotropes [^113c33B3].

> Wait, let me verify how this translates to modern practice. Contemporary heart failure care still uses these profiles conceptually, and noninvasive echocardiography has been adapted to assign Forrester-equivalent profiles using cardiac index and E/e′, enabling early risk stratification in acute HF cohorts; in the PREDICT study, profiles with low cardiac index had markedly higher risks of death or worsening HF within 14 days, supporting the continued relevance of the schema when applied noninvasively [^113rZDBg].

> I need to check limitations and alternatives so I don't overstate utility. The Forrester classification is a physiologic, not etiologic, tool and does not replace disease-specific diagnostics; it complements, but does not substitute for, comprehensive risk scores and guideline-directed evaluation, and its prognostic value is strongest for short-term outcomes rather than long-term trajectory, which depends on infarct size, coronary anatomy, and secondary prevention [^113c33B3].

> But wait, what if someone conflates this with the Forrest ulcer classification? I should double-check that distinction. The Forrest system classifies peptic ulcer stigmata of bleeding (e.g., spurting, oozing, visible vessel, adherent clot, flat spot, clean base) to predict rebleeding and guide endoscopic therapy; it is endoscopic and hemostasis-focused, whereas Forrester is hemodynamic and prognostic after MI, so mixing them would misdirect management decisions [^112AdErq] [^1178tHR7].

> Let me synthesize practical implications. At the bedside, recognizing a wet-cold profile should prompt aggressive decongestion and consideration of inotropy, while a warm-dry profile supports routine care and early mobilization; integrating Forrester profiling with modern biomarkers and imaging refines early risk stratification and aligns therapy intensity with hemodynamic severity, which remains a cornerstone of early MI and acute HF management frameworks [^113c33B3] [^113rZDBg].

---

The Forrester classification is a **hemodynamic risk stratification** system for acute heart failure that divides patients into four profiles based on perfusion and congestion: warm-and-dry (Profile I), warm-and-wet (Profile II), cold-and-dry (Profile III), and cold-and-wet (Profile IV) [^113c33B3]. It guides therapy by matching interventions to the underlying hemodynamic abnormality and is **strongly predictive of short-term outcomes**, with mortality rising from ~3% in Profile I to ~23% in Profile IV. Modern use often relies on noninvasive echocardiography to assign profiles at the bedside, supporting early risk stratification and targeted therapy in acute heart failure [^113rZDBg].

---

## Historical background and development

The Forrester classification was introduced in 1976 by James Forrester and colleagues to categorize patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) based on hemodynamic status. Initially, it used invasive hemodynamic measurements — cardiac output/index and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) — to define four distinct profiles. Over time, the system was adapted for acute heart failure and is now commonly applied using noninvasive echocardiography and clinical assessment [^113rZDBg].

---

## Classification criteria and hemodynamic profiles

The Forrester classification defines four hemodynamic profiles based on two parameters: **perfusion** (adequate vs inadequate) and **congestion** (absent vs present) [^113c33B3].

| **Profile** | **Description** | **Hemodynamic characteristics** | **Clinical features** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Profile I | Warm and dry | - Adequate perfusion <br/> - No congestion | - Hemodynamically stable <br/> - No signs of pulmonary edema or peripheral edema |
| Profile II | Warm and wet | - Adequate perfusion <br/> - Congestion present | - Pulmonary edema <br/> - Elevated JVP <br/> - Peripheral edema |
| Profile III | Cold and dry | - Inadequate perfusion <br/> - No congestion | - Hypotension <br/> - Cool extremities <br/> - Oliguria |
| Profile IV | Cold and wet | - Inadequate perfusion <br/> - Congestion present | - Severe hypotension <br/> - Pulmonary edema <br/> - Peripheral edema <br/> - Organ hypoperfusion |

---

## Clinical significance and prognostic value

The Forrester classification is **strongly predictive of short-term outcomes** in acute heart failure and AMI. Mortality increases progressively across profiles, from approximately 3% in Profile I to 23% in Profile IV. It also correlates with length of stay, ICU admission, and need for mechanical support, making it a valuable tool for early risk stratification and triage [^116qgbAy].

---

## Therapeutic implications

The Forrester classification guides therapy by aligning interventions with the underlying hemodynamic abnormality:

- **Profile I**: Standard heart failure therapy (ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers, diuretics as needed).
- **Profile II**: Aggressive diuresis and vasodilators to relieve congestion.
- **Profile III**: Inotropic support (e.g. dobutamine) to improve perfusion.
- **Profile IV**: Combination therapy with inotropes, vasodilators, and mechanical support (e.g. intra-aortic balloon pump) as indicated.

This tailored approach improves outcomes by directly addressing the dominant pathophysiology in each profile [^notfound].

---

## Limitations and challenges

Despite its utility, the Forrester classification has limitations:

- **Subjectivity**: Clinical assessment of perfusion and congestion can be subjective and operator-dependent.
- **Noninvasive adaptation**: While echocardiography enables noninvasive profiling, accuracy depends on operator expertise and patient factors.
- **Static snapshot**: The classification provides a moment-in-time assessment and may not capture dynamic changes in hemodynamics.
- **Limited granularity**: The four-profile system may oversimplify complex hemodynamic phenotypes.

---

## Modern adaptations and integration

Recent efforts have integrated the Forrester framework with noninvasive hemodynamics, biomarkers (e.g. NT-proBNP), and risk scores (e.g. GWTG-HF) to enhance accuracy and usability. Echocardiography-derived cardiac output and filling pressures are increasingly used to assign profiles at the bedside, enabling early, noninvasive risk stratification and therapy guidance [^113rZDBg].

---

## Comparison with other classification systems

The Forrester classification complements other systems, such as the Killip classification (focused on clinical severity in AMI) and the INTERMACS profiles (for mechanical circulatory support). Unlike these systems, Forrester explicitly incorporates perfusion and congestion, providing a more granular hemodynamic framework for acute heart failure management [^notfound].

---

## Clinical scenarios and examples

- **Profile I**: A patient with acute decompensated heart failure, stable vitals, and minimal edema.
- **Profile II**: A patient with pulmonary edema, elevated JVP, and normal blood pressure.
- **Profile III**: A patient with hypotension, cool extremities, and oliguria without edema.
- **Profile IV**: A patient with severe hypotension, pulmonary edema, and multi-organ dysfunction.

---

## Conclusion and future directions

The Forrester classification remains a **cornerstone of hemodynamic risk stratification** in acute heart failure, guiding therapy and predicting outcomes. Future work should focus on refining noninvasive profiling, integrating biomarkers, and validating dynamic, longitudinal applications to improve precision and adaptability in modern care pathways.

### Classification in anatomic pathology [^113Uj3o8]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2001). Low credibility.

Classification is the activity that allows pathologists to arrange the bewildering morphologic manifestations of disease into comprehensible order Ideally, our precise diagnoses would each be based on some timeless biological law of nature, and these diagnoses would group together patients with identical clinical manifestations and responses to therapy. However, in spite of the amazing success of pathology classification, it is apparent to everyone that diagnostic disagreements are common, and that patients who exactly fit into a diagnostic category often have markedly different disease courses and responses to therapy. At this time, it is unclear how quickly the potential of genomic medicine will be translated into revolutionary changes in pathology classification. However, it is clear that the rules of classification are part of the foundation of diagnostic pathology and that there is a high likelihood that pathology classification will undergo substantial changes in the next few years. This article reviews the topic of classification for pathologists who will practice during these interesting times.

### Reassessment of the predictive value of the forrest classification for peptic ulcer rebleeding and mortality: can classification be simplified? [^1158LGGa]. Endoscopy (2014). Low credibility.

Background and Study Aims

This study aimed to reassess whether the Forrest classification is still useful for the prediction of rebleeding and mortality in peptic ulcer bleedings and, based on this, whether the classification could be simplified.

Patients and Methods

Prospective registry data on peptic ulcer bleedings were collected and categorized according to the Forrest classification. The primary outcomes were 30-day rebleeding and all-cause mortality rates. Receiver operating characteristic curves were used to test whether simplification of the Forrest classification into high risk (Forrest Ia), increased risk (Forrest Ib-IIc), and low risk (Forrest III) classes could be an alternative to the original classification.

Results

In total, 397 patients were included, with 18 bleedings (4.5%) being classified as Forrest Ia, 73 (18.4%) as Forrest Ib, 86 (21.7%) as Forrest IIa, 32 (8.1%) as Forrest IIb, 59 (14.9%) as Forrest IIc, and 129 (32.5%) as Forrest III. Rebleeding occurred in 74 patients (18.6%). Rebleeding rates were highest in Forrest Ia peptic ulcers (59%). The odds ratios for rebleeding among Forrest Ib-IIc ulcers were similar. In subgroup analysis, predicting rebleeding using the Forrest classification was more reliable for gastric ulcers than for duodenal ulcers. The simplified Forrest classification had similar test characteristics to the original Forrest classification.

Conclusion

The Forrest classification still has predictive value for rebleeding of peptic ulcers, especially for gastric ulcers; however, it does not predict mortality. Based on these results, a simplified Forrest classification is proposed. However, further studies are needed to validate these findings.

### Diagnostic category prevalence in 3 classification systems across the transition to the international classification of diseases, tenth revision, clinical modification [^115hK1Fz]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Was the transition from International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) to the Tenth Revision (ICD-10-CM) in October 2015 associated with changes in diagnostic category prevalence when diagnoses are grouped by classification system?

Findings

This interrupted time series analysis and cross-sectional study examined insurance claims for more than 18 million privately insured adults and children in the US from 2010 to 2017 and found instantaneous increases or decreases of 20% or more associated with the ICD-10-CM transition for nearly 1 in 6 (16%) diagnostic categories in 2 of 3 influential diagnostic classification systems.

Meaning

These findings suggest that diagnostic classification systems developed with ICD-9-CM data may need to be refined for use with ICD-10-CM data for disease surveillance, performance assessment, or risk-adjusted payment.

### Perforated and bleeding peptic ulcer: WSES guidelines [^1178tHR7]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

In patients with spurting ulcer (Forrest 1a), oozing ulcer (Forrest 1b), and ulcer with non-bleeding visible vessel (Forrest 2a), endoscopic hemostasis is recommended (strong recommendation based on low-quality evidences, 1C)

In patients with bleeding peptic ulcer, we suggest dual modality for endoscopic hemostasis (weak recommendation based on moderate-quality evidences, 2B)

In patients with bleeding peptic ulcer, we suggest considering Doppler probe–guided endoscopic hemostasis if expertise is available (weak recommendation based on very low-quality evidences, 2D).

Endoscopy not only establishes the diagnosis but also treats the bleeding. WSES advocates patients' risk determination by using Blatchford score, Forrest classification, and clinical judgment. Three levels of risk stratification are proposed:
Very low risk — safe for outpatient management, low risk of death
Low risk — need for admission and early endoscopy
High risk — need for resuscitation and urgent endoscopy

### Diagnostic category prevalence in 3 classification systems across the transition to the international classification of diseases, tenth revision, clinical modification [^112jDLPm]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Diagnostic codes are widely used within health care in the US for reimbursement, quality assessment, public health reporting, calculating risk-adjusted payments, and studying clinical outcomes. In October 2015, the US switched its diagnostic coding system from the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) to the more detailed International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM), expanding the number of available codes nearly 5-fold. Previous studies have noted discontinuities in specific disease or population subgroups. This interrupted time series analysis and cross-sectional study sought to quantify the magnitude of change in prevalence in all diagnostic categories for 3 widely used diagnostic classification systems and to explore potential reasons for these changes through selected clinical review.

### A new clinical classification of acute myocardial infarction [^115ZMDk6]. Nature Medicine (2023). Excellent credibility.

The existence of a universal definition of myocardial infarction-which involves classification into multiple subtypes-has promoted the use of standard diagnostic criteria across the world. However, this classification has not been applied consistently in practice and is perceived by some as too complicated. Where there is diagnostic uncertainty, patients have worse outcomes. This uncertainty has also impacted on the validity of the diagnosis of myocardial infarction in clinical trials. To address these issues and to encourage clinicians to recognize that different mechanisms of myocardial infarction have differing treatment implications, we propose an alternative clinical classification for consideration; one that recognizes that myocardial infarction can arise spontaneously, secondary to another condition, or as a complication of a cardiac procedure. This classification is aligned with clinical practice and proposes more objective and specific diagnostic criteria that, if agreed by international consensus, could reduce diagnostic uncertainty in practice and research.

### Time to revisit disease classification in inflammatory bowel disease: is the current classification of inflammatory bowel disease good enough for optimal clinical management? [^117A5cKC]. Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), historically subdivided into Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, is a very heterogeneous condition. While the tendency in medicine is to try to reduce complexity, IBD is a disease that cannot justify a one-size-fits-all principle. Our current clinical classification tools are suboptimal and need further refinement to capture, at least in part, the variety of phenotypes encountered in daily clinical practice. Although these revised classification tools alone will not be sufficient and should be complemented by more detailed molecular subclassifications, optimized clinical phenotypes can contribute to improved trial designs, future translational research approaches, and better treatment outcomes. In the current review, we discuss key clinical features important in IBD disease heterogeneity, tackle limitations of the current classification systems, propose some potential improvements, and raise priorities for future research in this domain.

### A concept for the validation of fracture classifications [^115rWdBF]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2005). Low credibility.

The fracture classification systems currently used most frequently were not developed or validated by rigorous scientific evaluation methods. This paper discusses the classification of fractures from an epidemiological and clinical decision-making perspective and proposes a standardized methodological concept for their development and scientific validation. Classification categories are clinically relevant entities that surgeons should be able to use for diagnosis with sufficient confidence to limit misclassification and associated treatment errors. The process of validation should assess the value of specific clinical information (eg, the use of radiographs or computed tomography scans) in increasing the probability of a correct diagnosis. A 3-phase validation concept is proposed where: 1) classification categories are defined and the classification process using specific diagnostic images is evaluated by experts in a series of agreement studies (reliability, accuracy, likelihood ratios); 2) a multicenter agreement study is conducted among a representative group of future users of the classification; and 3) the classification proposal is applied in the context of a prospective clinical study to assess its clinical usefulness.

### Navigating nomenclature in patient care: taxonomy considerations from the college of American pathologists' microbiology committee [^111GYeAC]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Taxonomy classifies organisms based on shared traits, while nomenclature assigns formal names using distinct rules for bacteria, fungi, parasites, and viruses. Advances in genomic sequencing have refined microbial classification, often prompting name changes that can inadvertently impact clinical practice, including patient diagnosis, treatment, and communication among healthcare providers. Various organizations govern taxonomy and nomenclature differently across pathogen domains, and implementation of new nomenclature in clinical settings poses challenges. The College of American Pathologists has introduced requirements for laboratories to maintain consistent nomenclature across testing platforms and to consider use of contemporary nomenclature. While scientific accuracy is important, practical considerations must guide the adoption of new names to avoid confusion and ensure high-quality patient care.

### Recommendations for rosacea diagnosis, classification and management: update from the global ROSacea COnsensus 2019 panel [^1174shi4]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Summary

Background

A transition from a subtyping to a phenotyping approach in rosacea is underway, allowing individual patient management according to presenting features instead of categorization by predefined subtypes. Theaceansensus 2017 recommendations further support this transition and align with guidance from other working groups.

Objectives

To update and extend previous globalrecommendations in line with the latest research and continue supporting uptake of the phenotype approach in rosacea through clinical tool development.

Methods

Nineteen dermatologists and two ophthalmologists used a modified Delphi approach to reach consensus on statements pertaining to critical aspects of rosacea diagnosis, classification and management. Voting was electronic and blinded.

Results

Delphi statements on which the panel achieved consensus of ≥ 75% voting 'Agree' or 'Strongly agree' are presented. The panel recommends discussing disease burden with patients during consultations, using four questions to assist conversations. The primary treatment objective should be achievement of complete clearance, owing to previously established clinical benefits for patients. Cutaneous and ocular features are defined. Treatments have been reassessed in line with recent evidence and the prior treatment algorithm updated. Combination therapy is recommended to benefit patients with multiple features. Ongoing monitoring and dialogue should take place between physician and patients, covering defined factors to maximize outcomes. A prototype clinical tool (Rosacea Tracker) and patient case studies have been developed from consensus statements.

Conclusions

The current survey updates previous recommendations as a basis for local guideline development and provides clinical tools to facilitate a phenotype approach in practice and improve rosacea patient management.

What's already known about this topic?

A transition to a phenotype approach in rosacea is underway and is being recommended by multiple working groups.
New research has become available since the previous ROSCO consensus, necessitating an update and extension of recommendations.

What does this study add?

We offer updated global recommendations for clinical practice that account for recent research, to continue supporting the transition to a phenotype approach in rosacea.
We present prototype clinical tools to facilitate use of the phenotype approach in practice and improve management of patients with rosacea.

### Proposal for a scientifically correct and medically actionable disease classification system (ICD) for obesity [^112zYrAg]. Obesity (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

Obesity is responsible for a huge burden of suffering and social costs, and yet many patients lack access to evidence-based therapies. The diagnostic term "obesity" and inadequate International Classification of Diseases(ICD) codes contribute to suboptimal efforts to prevent and treat obesity as a chronic disease. The goal of this review is to develop a medically actionable classification system based on the diagnostic term "adiposity-based chronic disease" (ABCD) that reflects disease pathophysiology and specific complications causing morbidity and mortality.

Methods

A coding system based on the diagnosis of ABCD with four domains is proposed: A codes reflect pathophysiology, B codes indicate BMI classification, C codes specify specific biomechanical and cardiovascular complications remediable by weight loss, and D codes indicate the degree of the severity of complications. Supplemental codes identify aggravating factors that complicate care and that are relevant to a personalized therapeutic plan.

Results

The coding system addresses pathophysiology and therapeutic goals and differential risk, presence, and severity of specific complications that are integral to ABCD as a chronic disease.

Conclusions

The scientifically correct and medically actionable approach to diagnosis and disease coding will lead to greater acknowledgement of ABCD as a disease and accessibility to evidence-based therapies on behalf of patients across the life cycle.

### Low back pain [^117WYB3N]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2012). Medium credibility.

Low back pain: clinical practice guidelines — differential diagnosis advise that clinicians should consider diagnostic classifications associated with serious medical conditions or psychosocial factors and initiate referral to the appropriate medical practitioner when the patient's clinical findings suggest serious medical or psychological pathology, when reported activity limitations or impairments are not consistent with those in the diagnosis/classification section, or when symptoms are not resolving with interventions aimed at normalization of impairments of body function; recommendation based on strong evidence.

### Systematic review of generative adversarial networks (GANs) for medical image classification and segmentation [^117GWaTD]. Journal of Digital Imaging (2022). Medium credibility.

In recent years, generative adversarial networks (GANs) have gained tremendous popularity for various imaging related tasks such as artificial image generation to support AI training. GANs are especially useful for medical imaging-related tasks where training datasets are usually limited in size and heavily imbalanced against the diseased class. We present a systematic review, following the PRISMA guidelines, of recent GAN architectures used for medical image analysis to help the readers in making an informed decision before employing GANs in developing medical image classification and segmentation models. We have extracted 54 papers that highlight the capabilities and application of GANs in medical imaging from January 2015 to August 2020 and inclusion criteria for meta-analysis. Our results show four main architectures of GAN that are used for segmentation or classification in medical imaging. We provide a comprehensive overview of recent trends in the application of GANs in clinical diagnosis through medical image segmentation and classification and ultimately share experiences for task-based GAN implementations.

### ASRM Müllerian anomalies classification 2021 [^113h6q8P]. Fertility and Sterility (2021). High credibility.

ASRM müllerian anomalies classification 2021 — education, cross-disciplinary use, and advocacy: The new classification aims to educate providers and trainees across medical disciplines regarding the variety of anomalies and their presentation, diagnosis, and management, and guidance on imaging modalities, with examples, should be incorporated to aid in diagnosis. An interactive electronic format ideally facilitates comparisons between anomalies and education regarding their differences and similarities and can be incorporated into educational modules across specialties. Patients with müllerian anomalies are cared for not only by gynecologists, but also by providers in adolescent medicine, pediatrics, radiology, and pediatric urology and surgery, and an interactive format can be accessed to the desired depth by any learner or provider at any time to educate on presentation, diagnosis, and management options. The Task Force recognized that raising awareness of multiple variations is important because treatment options vary, and an accessible interactive format will allow for future expansion and greater educational options; the updated classification system should be inclusive and educational so that patient advocacy can be promoted.

### Further evolution of the ACC / AHA clinical practice guideline recommendation classification system: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines [^116j1kXT]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2016). Medium credibility.

ACC/AHA recommendation system — Principles for using COR and LOE emphasize independent pairing and explicit outcomes. The text states "COR and LOE are assessed independently. (any COR may be paired with any LOE)" and clarifies "A recommendation with LOE C does not imply that the recommendation is weak". It also instructs that "The outcome or result of the intervention should be specified (eg improved clinical outcome or increased diagnostic accuracy or incremental prognostic information)" and for comparative recommendations notes "For comparative-effectiveness recommendations (COR I and IIa; LOE A and B only), studies that support the use of comparators versus should involve direct comparisons of the treatments or strategies being evaluated". Additionally, "The method of assessing quality is evolving, including the application of standardized, widely used, and preferably validated evidence grading tools; and for systematic reviews, the incorporation of an Evidence Review Committee".

### Diagnostic category prevalence in 3 classification systems across the transition to the international classification of diseases, tenth revision, clinical modification [^116okivE]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Methods

Data and Study Sample

We used the IBM MarketScan Commercial Database from January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2017, including individuals ages 0 to 64 years enrolled in noncapitated commercial insurance plans with both medical and pharmacy benefits. The MarketScan database contains deidentified health care claims information from US employers, health plans, and hospitals. Data on all enrollment records and inpatient, outpatient, ancillary, and drug claims are collated and linked to individuals. The age and sex distribution of the eligible population varied little over the 96 months studied. Boston University's institutional review board exempted this study from review and informed consent owing to the use of deidentified data. Data were analyzed from December 1, 2018, to January 21, 2020.

Outcome

Our primary outcome was the monthly rate of individuals with at least 1 diagnosis in a diagnostic classification category per 10 000 enrollees. We used claim dates of service, health care practitioner type, and inpatient and outpatient procedure codes to identify claims that are allowed to contribute diagnostic codes, mimicking Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) filters used in risk adjustment, which only consider diagnoses from an acceptable health care practitioner claim type: hospital inpatient, hospital outpatient, or professional. Monthly prevalence rates were examined for changes in reported diagnostic category prevalence at and following the October 2015 ICD-10-CM transition.

Diagnostic Classification Systems

There were 14 567 allowable ICD-9-CM codes in 2015 vs 71 486 allowable ICD-10-CM codes in 2017 to describe patient medical conditions. To reduce complexity, predictive models and disease tracking systems rely on classification systems (ie, groupers) to collapse these codes into a smaller number of broadly homogeneous clinical categories. We explored 3 commonly used classification systems.

The World Health Organization (WHO) maps codes into chapters, which are commonly used for epidemiology and surveillance, based on their first 3 alphanumeric characters. The WHO's ICD-9-CM mapping had 19 chapters, which expanded to 21 chapters with the transition to ICD-10-CM by separating previously grouped eye, ear, and neurological disorders into distinct chapters. To facilitate cross-year comparisons, we maintained the 19-chapter structure.

### Classification of the severity of acute pancreatitis: how many categories make sense? [^111GVchf]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2010). Low credibility.

There is an ongoing effort to revise the 1992 Atlanta classification of acute pancreatitis in the light of emerging evidence. The categorization of the severity of acute pancreatitis is one of the key elements of the classification. This paper aims to define the optimal number of categories and provide their definitions on sound clinical grounds.

### Diagnostic category prevalence in 3 classification systems across the transition to the international classification of diseases, tenth revision, clinical modification [^116c2FUZ]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Our findings have important implications for interpreting differences in billing-code-derived disease prevalence over time. For epidemiology, it is critical to distinguish between changes in actual disease prevalence and changes in coding behaviors and mappings, which are often responsible for observed changes in coded prevalence. We have seen that 3 separate, widely used classification systems made different distinctions that affected apparent diagnostic category prevalence. Given that HHS payment formulas rely on the prevalence of HCC categories to set billions of dollars in payments, our finding of many large (artifactual) changes in diagnostic category prevalence has potentially large implications for reimbursement.

Although HHS-HCCs are used for the ACA's marketplace risk adjustment payments, this study did not examine financial outcomes. Because the ACA uses risk adjustment to reallocate the available funds among plans in a given region rather than to decide on the size of the funds available (as is done in Medicare Advantage and Part D), changes in diagnostic category prevalence may have had less financial effect in the marketplace than in Medicare Advantage. Classifications used for bonus or performance evaluation are also vulnerable to large changes in level or trend when preexisting ICD-9-CM –derived formulas are used across the ICD-10-CM transition. In addition, claims-based analyses of disease prevalence may also be misleading if changes in the underlying classification system are not recognized.

Our study used the earliest mappings accommodating all valid 2017 diagnoses for the included classification systems. In 2019, the WHO, HHS, and AHRQ released new classification systems with expanded diagnostic categories designed for 2019 diagnoses. Future research will need to examine changes under these new systems. In the meantime, it is important to understand the current mappings that will continue to be used to set payments and evaluate performance for several more years.

### The 2024 British Society for Rheumatology guideline for management of systemic sclerosis [^112VE8g3]. Rheumatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Current approach to classification and risk stratification

Subset and stage of SSc is relevant for management. Differentiation of limited or diffuse cutaneous subsets based upon extent of skin involvement has been central to management historically. While this classification has some practical value, it is now recognized that other factors should be considered in global management, and that subset independent factors also should be considered. Thus, an outcome-based classification incorporating skin subset and ANA subgroup has been proposed. This reflects the current approach used in many SSc centres. Importantly, it highlights that risk of certain complications crosses skin subset boundaries and may be more linked to ANA specificity. Unbiased data-driven approaches reinforce the need for individualized patient assessment beyond skin subset. Modern molecular analytic methods are being developed to help with classification in the future and may lead to better targeting of future therapies and more precise risk stratification.

From a paediatric rheumatology perspective regarding diagnosis and classification of juvenile onset SSc, an international study is currently validating the 2013 EULAR/ACR classification criteria in jSSc. Until this work is complete, either the 2013 EULAR/ACR classification criteria or the PRES/ACR/EULAR provisional classification criteria for jSSc can be used.

What is the best approach to early diagnosis and classification?

Guideline recommendation for diagnosis and classification of SSc:

Clinical diagnosis of SSc should be guided by validated classification criteria (1A, 96%).
Skin subset and SSc-associated autoantibody subset should be used to stratify for risk of specific organ-based complications (1B, 97%).
Assessment of nailfold microcirculation (capillaroscopy) should be performed as part of initial SSc assessment and when a diagnosis of SSc is suspected (2C, 96%).

### Biopsy in emergency gastroscopy does not increase the risk of rebleeding in patients with forrest I acute nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding combined with suspected malignant gastric ulcer: a multicenter retrospective cohort study [^1178HeKS]. BMC Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Methods

Data source and oversight

We searched the clinical data of all patients diagnosed with UGIB from June 2010 to June 2020 in the medical records system of three tertiary hospitals in Beijing, including diagnosis, treatment, vital signs, laboratory and imaging tests, EG results, pathology results, hospitalization costs, and demographic data. To protect the privacy of patients, the information related to the patient's name and identity was deleted in the search strategy. A unique reference number was allocated to each individual patient, facilitating data retrieval and further analysis. This study protocol was approved by the ethics committee of Xuanwu Hospital of Capital Medical University. Informed consent was waived as the data used in this study were anonymized, which was approved by the ethics committee at our hospital.

Study design

We performed a retrospective cohort study. ANVUGIB combined with gastric ulcer was identified in the medical records system using physician-assigned International Classification of Diseases 10th revision (ICD-10) codes. We included possible diagnoses of ANVUGIB combined with gastric ulcer, such as K92.204 (upper gastrointestinal bleeding) plus K25 (gastric ulcer), K25.001 (acute gastric ulcer with bleeding), K25.301 (acute gastric ulcer) and K25.401 (gastric ulcer with bleeding).

Inclusion criteria: Patients were eligible for inclusion in the study if they (> 18 years old) were admitted to the emergency department (ED) between June 2010 and June 2020 with evidence of Forrest I ANVUGIB combined with SMGU, and if they did not take antithrombotic or took only one of the antithrombotic, such as aspirin or clopidogrel. The exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) esophagogastric variceal bleeding; (2) gastric carcinoma confirmed before EG; and (3) incomplete medical records.

Forrest classification

Forrest classification was as follows: Ia spurting bleeding, Ib oozing bleeding, IIa nonbleeding visible vessel, IIb an adherent clot, IIc flat pigmented spot, and III clean base ulcer. The sites of bleeding were classified as the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum according to the gastroscopy results.

Some scoring systems have been developed to predict bleeding outcomes for patients with ANVUGIB bleeding. The Blatchford risk score is the most widely used scoring system in clinical practice (Table 1).

Table 1
Blatchford score

a A score ≥ 6 is classified as medium or high risk, and a score < 6 is classified as low risk

### Global implementation of the World Health Organization's international classification of diseases (ICD)-11: the allergic and hypersensitivity conditions model [^114nEAsQ]. Allergy (2020). Medium credibility.

The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) provides a common language for use worldwide as a diagnostic and classification tool for epidemiology, clinical purposes and health management. Since its first edition, the ICD has maintained a framework distributing conditions according to topography, with the result that some complex conditions, such as allergies and hypersensitivity disorders (A/H) including anaphylaxis, have been poorly represented. The change in hierarchy in ICD-11 permitted the construction of the pioneer section addressed to A/H, which may result in more accurate mortality and morbidity statistics, including more accurate accounting for mortality due to anaphylaxis, strengthen classification, terminology and definitions. The ICD-11 was presented and adopted by the 72nd World Health Assembly in May 2019, and the implementation is ongoing worldwide. We here present the outcomes from an online survey undertaken to reach out the allergy community worldwide in order to peer review the terminology, classification and definitions of A/H introduced into ICD-11 and to support their global implementation. Data are presented here for 406 respondents from 74 countries. All of the subsections of the new A/H section of the ICD-11 had been considered with good accuracy by the majority of respondents. We believe that, in addition to help during the implementation phase, all the comments provided will help to improve the A/H classification and to increase awareness by different disciplines of what actions are needed to ensure more accurate epidemiological data and better clinical management of A/H patients.

### An introduction to machine learning for classification and prediction [^111nuFwE]. Family Practice (2023). Medium credibility.

Classification and prediction tasks are common in health research. With the increasing availability of vast health data repositories (e.g. electronic medical record databases) and advances in computing power, traditional statistical approaches are being augmented or replaced with machine learning (ML) approaches to classify and predict health outcomes. ML describes the automated process of identifying ("learning") patterns in data to perform tasks. Developing an ML model includes selecting between many ML models (e.g. decision trees, support vector machines, neural networks); model specifications such as hyperparameter tuning; and evaluation of model performance. This process is conducted repeatedly to find the model and corresponding specifications that optimize some measure of model performance. ML models can make more accurate classifications and predictions than their statistical counterparts and confer greater flexibility when modelling unstructured data or interactions between covariates; however, many ML models require larger sample sizes to achieve good classification or predictive performance and have been criticized as "black box" for their poor transparency and interpretability. ML holds potential in family medicine for risk profiling of patients' disease risk and clinical decision support to present additional information at times of uncertainty or high demand. In the future, ML approaches are positioned to become commonplace in family medicine. As such, it is important to understand the objectives that can be addressed using ML approaches and the associated techniques and limitations. This article provides a brief introduction into the use of ML approaches for classification and prediction tasks in family medicine.

### Development of data-driven clinical pathways: the big data clinical evidence-based pathways [^113TKNeM]. BMJ Health & Care Informatics (2025). High credibility.

The second key element is the correct classification of evidence. The objective and reasonable classification of large amounts of chaotic clinically produced data can convert it into evidence. Evidence can be divided into two categories: diagnosis and therapy. Diagnosis items can be subdivided into imaging, examination, endoscopy, pathology, nuclear medicine, etc, and therapy items can be divided into surgery, anaesthesia, intervention, drugs and consumables. An evidence bank was established according to the classification of diagnosis and therapy items, and the evidence was integrated into CEBPWs for different disease groups according to different needs.

The third key element is evidence value weight. Different 'diagnosis+therapy' groups have different diagnosis and therapy methods, which involve a large number of diagnosis and therapy items. As the diagnosis and therapy items pose huge challenges to medical insurance payment and medical management, it is necessary to analyse the cost of each item based on data. According to a few key principles, the diagnosis of a DIP group accounts for 80% of the total examination cost, corresponding to 20% of the examination items, and these items were clustered and summarised as the evidence of diagnosis value weight. The evidence of therapy value weight is also formed in the same way for therapy items. These key core items must exist in the corresponding disease group to standardise the disease diagnosis and therapy process, ensure the quality of care and objectively fit the cost and medical technology level. Using weight of evidence value makes the formulation of CEBPWs simplified, and the use of data is more targeted and applicable.

### An educational assessment of evidence used for variant classification: a report of the Association for Molecular Pathology [^113fvqqC]. The Journal of Molecular Diagnostics (2022). High credibility.

Variant classification assessment — evaluation methods and analysis parameters are as follows: Participant responses were evaluated in two ways, first by comparing the reported variant classification with the intended classification made by the Working Group, and second by comparing each participant's classification to a calculated classification generated from the participant's reported satisfied criteria using published rules. For 17 challenges the intended response was a single classification, whereas for seven variants two classifications were allowed. Consensus for a variant challenge was defined as 80% or higher. Analyses were stratified by challenge difficulty and other factors, categorical responses were compared using Fisher's Exact or χ2 tests, significance was two-sided at P = 0.05, no adjustments for multiple comparisons were made, and 95% CIs for proportions were provided when relevant.

### Further evolution of the ACC / AHA clinical practice guideline recommendation classification system: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines [^1149y4wQ]. Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

ACC/AHA recommendation classification system — guideline recommendations are categorized by the Class of Recommendation (COR) and Level of Evidence (LOE), where COR reflects the magnitude of benefit over risk and corresponds to the strength of the recommendation and LOE denotes the confidence or certainty of the supporting evidence. Class I recommendations are strong, indicating that a treatment, procedure, or intervention is useful and effective and should be performed or administered for most patients under most circumstances. Class II recommendations are weaker, with benefit generally greater for Class IIa (moderate) and smaller for Class IIb (weak), for which benefit only marginally exceeds risk. Class III is assigned when actions are specifically not recommended, either because studies have found no evidence of benefit or because the intervention causes harm. In general for pharmacological treatments or therapeutic procedures, data from randomized controlled trials provide a higher LOE than observational or retrospective studies, while other considerations apply for diagnostic testing, population-based interventions, or lifestyle modifications.

### Optimal perfusion targets in cardiogenic Shock [^113c33B3]. JACC: Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

Moving beyond specific physical examination findings, the original Forrester classification from 1976 identified 4 hemodynamic profiles of patients following AMI, based on the presence or absence of congestion and presence or absence of adequate perfusion: warm-dry (no congestion or hypoperfusion); wet-warm (congestion but no hypoperfusion); dry-cold (no congestion but hypoperfusion); and wet-cold (congestion and hypoperfusion). These profiles correlate with short-term mortality, with higher mortality noted with congestion and further increased with the added insult of hypoperfusion. Stevenson et al applied these hemodynamic profiles to a cohort of 452 patients with advanced heart failure and hypothesized about the utility of titrating therapy in hemodynamic profile — focusing on diuresis on the warm-wet patient — vs accepting the risks of inotrope therapy in the cold-wet patient who needs both augmented diuresis and perhaps, inotropic support. For the clinician at the bedside, the findings of an elevated JVP, pulmonary congestion, prolonged capillary refill time, and "cold extremities" may be particularly useful in the initial assessment of the patient with CS. It is difficult to identify clear therapeutic targets in the physical exam, but given the prognostic value of both signs of congestion and hypoperfusion, one could reasonably titrate therapy to target clinical euvolemia and a peripheral exam suggestive of warm, well-perfused extremities. Ultimately, the physical examination in isolation can provide important prognostic information and should be integrated into the initial assessment and management of these patients.

### Applying the phenotype approach for rosacea to practice and research [^114T515r]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Rosacea diagnosis and classification have evolved since the 2002 National Rosacea Society expert panel subtype approach. Several working groups are now aligned to a more patient-centric phenotype approach, based on an individual's presenting signs and symptoms. However, subtyping is still commonplace across the field and an integrated strategy is required to ensure widespread progression to the phenotype approach.

Objectives

To provide practical recommendations that facilitate adoption of a phenotype approach across the rosacea field.

Methods

A review of the literature and consolidation of rosacea expert experience.

Results

We identify challenges to implementing a phenotype approach in rosacea and offer practical recommendations to overcome them across clinical practice, interventional research, epidemiological research and basic science.

Conclusions

These practical recommendations are intended to indicate the next steps in the progression from subtyping to a phenotype approach in rosacea, with the goals of improving our understanding of the disease, facilitating treatment developments and ultimately improving care for patients with rosacea.

### Upper gastrointestinal bleeding differences between older and younger adults: should bleeding in non-cirrhotic patients be considered a geriatric syndrome? [^114E4otq]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Definition of variables, comorbidities, and other covariates

Older patients were considered to have a chronological age equal or above 65 years old as previously suggested. Cirrhosis and CHF were defined in patients with a known history or clinical, laboratory, and imaging findings compatible with liver disease and CHF. Diabetes mellitus was considered in patients with a known history or who fulfilled the diagnostic criteria. For patients with confirmed PUD as the underlying cause of UGIB, the Forrest classification system was employed.

Endoscopic hemostatic therapy included one or more of the following methods: sclerotherapy with polidocanol, cyanoacrylate, bipolar electrocoagulation therapy, argon plasma coagulation, topical hemostatic spray/powder, band ligation, through-the-scope, and over-the-scope clip, with or without epinephrine injection.

Surgery was regarded as the need for laparotomy/laparoscopic intervention due to refractory UGIB not amenable to all methods of endoscopic hemostasis. Rebleeding was defined as evidence of an overt bleeding episode or a decrease of at least 2 g/dL in hemoglobin levels after initial treatment and stabilization.

A subgroup analysis was performed, excluding all patients with liver cirrhosis, and both groups were subject to the same analysis as the complete sample.

### An educational assessment of evidence used for variant classification: a report of the Association for Molecular Pathology [^116FUHZv]. The Journal of Molecular Diagnostics (2022). High credibility.

Variant classification assessment — participant characteristics and agreement outcomes show that eighty-one individual participants provided responses, with 66 (81%) from the United States and 15 (19%) from elsewhere, and that there were 1376 reported variant classifications, of which 1119 agreed with the Working Group's intended response (81%; 95% CI, 79% to 84%). Across the distinct 24 total variant challenges, agreement with the intended response ranged from 100% (VITAL 6B and VITAL 7) to 44% (VITAL 9), and 16 (67%; 47% to 82%) reached a consensus. When intended responses included two classifications, participant agreement was 91% (389/428; 88% to 93%), versus 77% (730/951; 74% to 79%) when the intended response was a single classification, a difference that was significant (P < 0.001). By challenge difficulty, 10 (67%) easy, five (83%) moderate, and one (33%) difficult challenges reached consensus. Using participants' reported criteria to calculate classifications, there was 82% agreement (1121/1365; 80% to 84%) between participants' classifications and the calculated classification.

### Assessment and classification of patients with myocardial injury and infarction in clinical practice [^111aXUbz]. Heart (2017). Low credibility.

The global task force is reviewing the universal definition of myocardial infarction and recognises the need to provide clearer diagnostic criteria and guidance. Based on the current guidelines, differentiating between patients with type 2 myocardial infarction and acute myocardial injury is challenging as there remains overlap between these two clinical entities, and classification is therefore inconsistent in clinical practice. Similarly, in the absence of an accepted definition, it is difficult to perform standardised evaluations across different healthcare settings, or to conduct randomised trials to determine the effectiveness of investigative strategies or preventative treatments for these patients.

### The effects of dapagliflozin in a real-world population of HFrEF patients with different hemodynamic profiles: worse is better [^114tgVR2]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Heart failure (HF) is an ever-evolving medical and economic challenge. However, more and more therapeutic strategies have been implemented to prevent the onset and to improve the prognosis of this complex medical syndrome. Current European and American guidelines for HF strongly recommend the use of a relatively new class of drug, the Sodium-Glucose Cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i). This class of drugs was initially introduced as an antidiabetic medication. Since DECLARE TIMI and EMPAREG-OUTCOME demonstrated their potential value in diabetic patients at high cardiovascular risk, their role in the treatment of HF has been established. Subsequent large-scale randomized clinical trials, such as DAPA-HF, DELIVER, EMPEROR-Reduced and EMPEROR-Preserved, demonstrated that Dapagliflozin and Empagliflozin, compared to placebo, reduce major adverse cardiovascular events in patients affected by HF, irrespective of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and diabetic status.

The use of SGLT2i in clinical practice has become widespread soon, as their efficacy is associated with an excellent safety profile and pleiotropic effects. Moreover, this class of drugs has shown to be effective independently of LVEF. However, there are still few real-world studies, and the patients enrolled in trials often do not reflect those who come daily to cardiologist's observations. Consequently, in this prospective observational study, the primary aim is to evaluate how Dapagliflozin affects clinical, biochemical, echocardiographic, and functional parameters in a real-world HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) population in different hemodynamic settings, with respect to baseline. Indeed, although LVEF classification is the most used for therapeutic choices, it does not consider the hemodynamic state of the patients, and it is based on a single variable parameter that is not representative of the dynamic evolution of the disease. Clinically, patients with HF may be stratified according to the Forrester's classification, into four heamodynamic profiles depending on the peripheral perfusion (cold to warm) and the pulmonary congestion states (wet to dry); however, echocardiography is an excellent noninvasive hemodynamic tool. Therefore, we applied a well-specified echocardiographic defined haemodynamic classification in a real-world HFrEF population, gaining four profiles from noninvasive data, and evaluated the benefits and efficacy of Dapagliflozin in the different groups.

### Rosacea: new concepts in classification and treatment [^1165sJ5D]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Updated Diagnosis and Classification System of Rosacea

In 2002, the American National Rosacea Society provided a provisional diagnosis and classification system to facilitate communication by using standard criteria between clinicians, researchers, patients, and health and insurance organizations. In this schema, any of the following primary features in a central distribution on the face was diagnostic for rosacea: flushing (transient erythema), nontransient erythema, papules and pustules, and telangiectasia. Secondary features, which may be present with primary features or appear independently, included burning or stinging sensation, plaque, dry appearance, edema, ocular manifestations, peripheral location, and phymatous changes. Furthermore, they proposed four presentations called subtypes (erythematotelangiectatic, papulopustular, phymatous, ocular) and one variant (granulomatous). This system has subsequently been widely used for diagnosis, classification, and treatment of rosacea by clinicians and researchers and in the scientific literature. With increased clinical use, shortcomings of this system in diagnosis and classification were increasingly recognized. Diagnostic shortcomings were inclusion of features with low predictive value (flushing, papules/pustules, telangiectasia) and exclusion of phyma, of high predictive value. In subtyping, shortcomings included conflation of multiple features into discrete categories that did not accurately represent the presentation of rosacea patients and within which it was impossible to evaluate the relative prevalence of each feature. This fostered a degree of confusion in epidemiological and clinical trial research due to the inability to accurately evaluate key features of interest. Consequently, a schema established on patient features that encompassed the diversity of clinical presentations was proposed by the global ROSacea COnsensus (ROSCO) panel in 2017. This phenotype approach was based on an "individual's observable characteristics that can be influenced by genetic or environmental factors". The ROSCO panel represented an international rosacea expert group of dermatologists and ophthalmologists from Asia, Africa, Europe, North America, and South America to ensure global representation. In this paradigm, subsequently endorsed by the National Rosacea Society, two features were independently diagnostic for rosacea. In their absence, the presence of two or more major features can establish the diagnosis. Furthermore, minor features might also present with diagnostic and/or major features (Table 1). The next step was to align the management strategies with the phenotype approach to enable optimization of patient outcomes and improve general well-being by targeting those features most bothersome to the patient.

### The clinical utility of noninvasive forrester classification in acute heart failure from PREDICT study [^113rZDBg]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2023). Medium credibility.

The Forrester classification plays a crucial role in comprehending the underlying pathophysiology of heart failure (HF) and is employed to categorize the severity and predict the outcomes of patients with acute HF. Our objective was to assess the predictive value of the Forrester classification, based on noninvasive hemodynamic measurements obtained through Doppler echocardiography at admission, in forecasting the short-term prognosis posthospitalization of patients with acute HF. Patients were recruited for the Prospect trial to elucidate the utility of EchocarDIography-based Cardiac ouTput in acute heart failure (PREDICT) study, a multicenter, prospective study conducted in Japan. Participants were stratified into 4 profiles using cardiac index (CI) and early mitral filling velocity (E)/early-diastolic mitral annular velocity (e') ratio obtained from Doppler echocardiography upon admission (profile I: CI > 2.2, E/e' ≤ 15, profile II: CI > 2.2, E/e' > 15, profile III: CI ≤ 2.2, E/e' ≤ 15, profile IV: CI ≤ 2.2, E/e' > 15). The primary composite outcome of the study was all-cause mortality or worsening HF during the 14 days of hospitalization. Cox proportional hazards model analysis was employed to identify prognostic factors during the observation period. A total of 270 subjects, with a mean age of 74 ± 14 years and a male proportion of 60%, were enrolled in the study. During the 14-day period of hospitalization, 58 participants (22%) had a composite outcome. Patients with low CI (i.e., profiles III and IV) demonstrated an elevated risk of composite outcome after adjusting for confounding variables, as evidenced by the adjusted hazard ratios of 5.85 (95% confidence interval 1.17 to 29.09, p < 0.01, vs profile III) and 6.50 (95% confidence interval 1.53 to 27.68, p < 0.01, vs profile IV) in comparison with profile I, respectively. In conclusion, the Forrester classification, derived from noninvasive Doppler echocardiography at admission, may predict early deterioration in patients hospitalized with acute HF.

### The role of endoscopic Doppler US in patients with peptic ulcer bleeding [^116SCnmU]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Stigmata of recent hemorrhage are important prognostic signs for patients with ulcer bleeding, but these are subjective findings. This study evaluated the additional diagnostic value of Doppler US assessment in patients with a bleeding peptic ulcer.

Methods

A prospective, multicenter study was performed of patients with ulcer bleeding. Stigmata of recent hemorrhage were classified according to the Forrest classification, after which the ulcer was assessed by using an endoscopic Doppler US system. Patients with a Forrest Ib-IIb ulcer with a positive Doppler signal received endoscopic therapy. Patients with a Forrest IIc-III ulcer with a positive Doppler signal were allocated randomly to endoscopic therapy or no therapy. No ulcer without a Doppler signal was treated.

Results

A total of 80 patients were enrolled. Of the Forrest Ib-IIb ulcers, 82% had a positive Doppler signal. Of the Forrest IIc-III ulcers, 53% had a positive Doppler signal. There was no difference in the rates of recurrent bleeding, surgery, or mortality between the group with Forrest Ib-IIb ulcers and between the Forrest IIc-III group with and without Doppler signal, but there was little power in the sample size to detect differences. Bleeding recurred in 3 patients without a Doppler signal. Recurrent bleeding was more frequent in the group in which a Doppler signal was still present immediately after endoscopic therapy (3/11 vs. 1/27; p = 0.06).

Conclusions

This study did not substantiate a role for endoscopic Doppler US when this was added to the Forrest classification for making clinical decisions in patients with ulcer bleeding.

### Further evolution of the ACC / AHA clinical practice guideline recommendation classification system: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines [^111QThzC]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2016). Medium credibility.

Classes of Recommendation and Levels of Evidence — guideline recommendations are categorized by the Class of Recommendation (COR) and Level of Evidence (LOE), and the COR reflects the magnitude of benefit over risk and corresponds to the strength of the recommendation. Class I recommendations are strong and indicate that the treatment, procedure, or intervention is useful and effective and should be performed or administered for most patients under most circumstances. Class II recommendations are weaker, denoting a lower degree of benefit in proportion to risk, and benefit is generally greater for Class IIa (moderate) recommendations and smaller for Class IIb (weak) recommendations, for which benefit only marginally exceeds risk; a COR of IIb suggests that implementation should be selective and based on careful consideration of individual patient factors and, for invasive procedures, available expertise. Class III is assigned when actions are specifically not recommended, either because studies have found no evidence of benefit or because the intervention causes harm. The LOE denotes the confidence in or certainty of the evidence supporting the recommendation, based on the type, size, quality, and consistency of pertinent research findings, and in general, for pharmacological treatments or therapeutic procedures, data from randomized controlled trials provide a higher LOE than observational or retrospective studies, although other considerations apply to recommendations involving diagnostic testing, population-based interventions, or lifestyle modifications.

### Assessment and classification of patients with myocardial injury and infarction in clinical practice [^114ZWAW5]. Heart (2017). Low credibility.

Classification of myocardial injury and infarction

The introduction of more sensitive cardiac troponin assays and lower diagnostic thresholds led to a major revision of the guidelines introducing a classification by aetiology to acknowledge that myocardial injury occurs in a wide range of clinical presentations (figure 1). The third universal definition of myocardial infarction provided an international consensus on the classification of myocardial injury and infarction. The diagnosis of myocardial infarction requires evidence of myocardial necrosis in a clinical setting consistent with acute myocardial ischaemia. These criteria require detection of a rise and/or fall in cardiac biomarker levels (preferably cardiac troponin) with at least one value above the 99th percentile upper reference limit, with at least one of the following: (1) symptoms of myocardial ischaemia, (2) new or presumed new significant ST-segment T-wave changes or new left bundle branch block, (3) development of pathological Q-waves on the electrocardiogram, (4) imaging evidence of loss of viable myocardium or new regional wall motion abnormality or (5) identification of intracoronary thrombus by angiography or autopsy.

Figure 1
Classification proposed by the third universal definition of myocardial infarction.

The classification distinguishes between type 1 myocardial infarction due to thrombosis of an atherosclerotic plaque and type 2 myocardial infarction due to myocardial oxygen supply-demand imbalance in the context of another acute illness. Myocardial infarctions presenting as sudden death (type 3), or after percutaneous coronary intervention (type 4) and coronary artery bypass grafting (type 5) are also defined. Acute myocardial injury is classified where troponin concentrations are elevated with evidence of dynamic change in the absence of overt myocardial ischaemia, whereas in chronic myocardial injury troponin concentrations remain unchanged on serial testing. This is an important distinction, as the underlying pathological mechanisms in acute and chronic myocardial injury are likely to differ.

This classification is contentious and was based on expert consensus rather than evidence from prospective clinical trials. While it has been adopted in research studies, implementation in clinical practice has been less consistent. The most contentious diagnosis is that of type 2 myocardial infarction; a concept based on clinical hypothesis and observation without prospective mechanistic evaluation. Patients classified with type 2 myocardial infarction are heterogeneous and have myocardial ischaemia secondary to a variety of acute medical or surgical conditions. Based on the current criteria, a diagnosis of type 2 myocardial infarction could be applied to patients without coronary artery disease. At present, there is no guidance or consensus on the optimal cardiac investigation, management or treatment strategy for patients with type 2 myocardial infarction.

### Classification of cough as a symptom in adults and management algorithms: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^115GbBJs]. Chest (2018). Medium credibility.

CHEST guideline — recommendation development used a structured consensus-based modified Delphi approach, and for a recommendation or suggestion to be approved by the Expert Cough Panel, "75% of the eligible panel members had to vote, and 80% of those voting had to strongly agree or agree with the statement". Within this framework, "a strong recommendation applies to almost all patients, whereas a weak recommendation is conditional and applies to only some patients", with strength "based on consideration of three factors: balance of benefits to harms, patient values and preferences, and resource considerations", where harms can include "convenience or lack of convenience, difficulty of administration, and invasiveness", resource considerations "go beyond economics and should also factor in time and other indirect costs", and a patient representative "provided patient-centered input".

### Assessment and classification of patients with myocardial injury and infarction in clinical practice [^111gf4Hm]. Heart (2017). Low credibility.

Pragmatic classification of patients with myocardial injury and infarction

We believe there remains scope for clarification of the diagnostic criteria for type 2 myocardial infarction and myocardial injury and that this is necessary to encourage clinicians to adopt the classification proposed in the universal definition. This clinical classification acknowledges the central role of coronary artery disease in the pathogenesis of myocardial infarction.

'Acute myocardial injury' is a term that clinicians are likely to accept, analogous to 'acute kidney injury' or 'acute liver injury', and does not predicate the mechanism of injury. This term should embrace all patients with acute myocardial injury identified in the context of an alternative acute illness, including those patients with chest pain or evidence of myocardial ischemia. The mechanism of myocardial injury will determine whether any cardiac or coronary investigations or therapies are indicated.

For example, while a patient with a submassive pulmonary embolism and an elevation in cardiac troponin may have both chest pain and an abnormal electrocardiogram, a diagnosis of type 2 myocardial infarction is unhelpful. The diagnosis is pulmonary embolism and acute myocardial injury due to hypoxia or right ventricular strain; coronary investigations and secondary prevention are not indicated.

The term type 2 myocardial infarction should, in our opinion, be used exclusively in patients with acute myocardial injury where coronary artery disease has contributed and where there may be opportunities to improve outcomes through coronary revascularisation or medical therapy. Selection of patients with acute myocardial injury for further investigation will depend on the nature of primary illness and the patient's probability of having coronary artery disease.

For example, a patient with chronic kidney disease who presents with a community-acquired pneumonia may have persistently elevated cardiac troponin concentrations. The subsequent development of chest pain and ischaemic changes on the electrocardiogram with a temporal rise in serum cardiac troponin concentrations may be due to hypoxia, tachycardia or hypotension, with the acute illness representing a 'physiological stress test' identifying otherwise quiescent stable coronary artery disease. The initial diagnosis is 'acute myocardial injury', and the need for further investigation for coronary artery disease should be guided by an assessment of cardiovascular risk. In patients with a low probability of coronary artery disease, further cardiac investigations may not be necessary. In patients with an intermediate or high probability, imaging to identify those with coronary artery disease should be considered. Should these investigations confirm the presence of coronary artery disease without evidence of plaque rupture, the diagnosis of type 2 myocardial infarction would be appropriate and secondary prevention should be considered.

### A computer assisted diagnosis tool for the classification of burns by depth of injury [^114aKTnH]. Burns (2005). Low credibility.

In this paper, a computer assisted diagnosis (CAD) tool for the classification of burns into their depths is proposed. The aim of the system is to separate burn wounds from healthy skin, and to distinguish among the different types of burns (burn depths) by means of digital photographs. It is intended to be used as an aid to diagnosis in local medical centres, where there is a lack of specialists. Another potential use of the system is as an educational tool. The system is based on the analysis of digital photographs. It extracts from those images colour and texture information, as these are the characteristics observed by physicians in order to form a diagnosis. Clinical effectiveness of the method was demonstrated on 35 clinical burn wound images, yielding an average classification success rate of 88% compared to expert classified images.

### Type 2 myocardial infarction: challenges in diagnosis and treatment [^112W8CNU]. European Heart Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

The Fourth Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction recommends a classification based on aetiology, in recognition that the underlying pathophysiology of myocardial infarction influences the approach to investigation and treatment. Type 1 myocardial infarction occurs due to atherosclerotic plaque rupture with thrombosis, whereas type 2 myocardial infarction occurs due to an imbalance in myocardial oxygen supply or unmet need in myocardial oxygen demand, without atherothrombosis, usually in the context of another acute illness. In this state-of-the-art review, the diagnosis, investigation, and treatment of patients with type 2 myocardial infarction are considered, with general advice for clinical practice and a consideration of future research directions.

### ASRM Müllerian anomalies classification 2021 [^114ALjFv]. Fertility and Sterility (2021). High credibility.

ASRM müllerian anomalies classification 2021 — background and rationale — summarizes that there are many proposed classification systems and that the American Fertility Society (AFS) Classification has been the most recognized and utilized, with advantages of simplicity, recognizability, and correlation with clinical pregnancy outcomes, yet criticisms of focusing primarily on uterine anomalies, excluding the vagina and cervix, lacking clear diagnostic criteria, and inability to classify complex anomalies. Additional systems include the VCUAM classification (Vagina, Cervix, Uterus, Adnexa, and associated Malformations), a schema by Acién and Acién according to embryologic origin, and a European Society of Human Reproduction (ESHRE) and European Society for Gynaecological Endoscopy (ESGE) classification based primarily on uterine anatomy with cervical and vaginal anomalies as independent supplementary subclasses; in addition, specific measurement criteria using three-dimensional ultrasound are used to define septate and bicornuate uterus. Despite these, the wide range of müllerian anomalies is still largely unknown and confusing to many providers, leading to undiagnosed conditions, inappropriate or inadequate surgical interventions, and persistent issues such as pain or loss of reproductive function. To address this, the American Society for Reproductive Medicine Task Force on Müllerian Anomalies Classification was formed and charged with designing a new classification, chose to base it on the AFS classification because of its simplicity and recognizability while expanding and updating it to include all categories of anomalies, and presents the new American Society for Reproductive Medicine Müllerian Anomalies Classification 2021.

### Classification of traumatic brain injury for targeted therapies [^113qQiCp]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2008). Low credibility.

The heterogeneity of traumatic brain injury (TBI) is considered one of the most significant barriers to finding effective therapeutic interventions. In October, 2007, the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, with support from the Brain Injury Association of America, the Defense and Veterans Brain Injury Center, and the National Institute of Disability and Rehabilitation Research, convened a workshop to outline the steps needed to develop a reliable, efficient and valid classification system for TBI that could be used to link specific patterns of brain and neurovascular injury with appropriate therapeutic interventions. Currently, the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) is the primary selection criterion for inclusion in most TBI clinical trials. While the GCS is extremely useful in the clinical management and prognosis of TBI, it does not provide specific information about the pathophysiologic mechanisms which are responsible for neurological deficits and targeted by interventions. On the premise that brain injuries with similar pathoanatomic features are likely to share common pathophysiologic mechanisms, participants proposed that a new, multidimensional classification system should be developed for TBI clinical trials. It was agreed that preclinical models were vital in establishing pathophysiologic mechanisms relevant to specific pathoanatomic types of TBI and verifying that a given therapeutic approach improves outcome in these targeted TBI types. In a clinical trial, patients with the targeted pathoanatomic injury type would be selected using an initial diagnostic entry criterion, including their severity of injury. Coexisting brain injury types would be identified and multivariate prognostic modeling used for refinement of inclusion/exclusion criteria and patient stratification. Outcome assessment would utilize endpoints relevant to the targeted injury type. Advantages and disadvantages of currently available diagnostic, monitoring, and assessment tools were discussed. Recommendations were made for enhancing the utility of available or emerging tools in order to facilitate implementation of a pathoanatomic classification approach for clinical trials.

### Further evolution of the ACC / AHA clinical practice guideline recommendation classification system: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines [^1176Uqb8]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2016). Medium credibility.

ACC/AHA clinical practice guideline recommendation classification system — evolution in context emphasizes greater reliance on higher-quality evidence and limiting lower-quality evidence, aligns with recommendations promulgated by the Institute of Medicine and facilitates comparison of the strength (or COR) and quality (or LOE) with categories used by other guideline developers, and is intended mainly to increase the granularity and precision of the ACC/AHA system while broadly retaining the COR and LOE categories familiar to readers of both US and European cardiovascular guidelines. The changes aim to ensure comprehensive, objective assessment of all available evidence and delivery of recommendations in a uniform format that is most useful at the point of care, while ongoing challenges include developing more objective and standardized criteria for assessing the quality of evidence, incorporating cost and health economic methodology, formulating more efficient processes for revising and updating as new evidence emerges, and creating tools to integrate context-sensitive guideline recommendations with electronic health records, and the structured system for classifying the strength of clinical recommendations and quality of the evidence supporting them remains at the heart of the guidelines.

### Assessment and classification of patients with myocardial injury and infarction in clinical practice [^112kHViM]. Heart (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

The definition of acute myocardial infarction has evolved to accommodate increasingly sensitive markers of myocardial necrosis and imaging methods that allow greater understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms of acute coronary syndrome. As such, the universal definition of myocardial infarction proposes that we classify patients with myocardial infarction based on aetiology. While this classification has been used in clinical trials to refine primary and secondary endpoints, it has not been widely adopted in clinical practice, and the frequency and implications of subtypes of acute myocardial infarction are uncertain.

We now recognise a spectrum of acute and chronic myocardial injury due to a variety of cardiac and non-cardiac causes in clinical practice. The most contentious diagnosis is that of type 2 myocardial infarction, which is defined as myocardial necrosis with evidence of ischaemia due to myocardial oxygen supply-demand imbalance in the context of another acute illness. Differentiating between patients with type 2 myocardial infarction and those patients with myocardial necrosis in the absence of ischaemia, in whom the recommended classification is myocardial injury, is challenging, as there is considerable overlap between these two clinical entities. Outcomes for both groups of patients are poor, and investigation and management are inconsistent in practice. It is likely that this is at least in part due to variability in interpretation of the guidelines.

Here, we summarise the available literature on the prevalence and outcomes of subtypes of myocardial injury and infarction, and aim to provide practical guidance for the clinician to aid the assessment and investigation of patients with undifferentiated myocardial injury.

### Prognosis of acute myocardial infarction in the thrombolytic era: medical evaluation is still valuable [^116qgbAy]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Modern and sophisticated technology for the management of myocardial infarction has progressively devalued medical evaluation.

Hypothesis

This study was undertaken to assess the importance of the findings of medical evaluation at hospital presentation, in patients with acute myocardial infarction.

Methods

Data from 590 thrombolytic-treated myocardial infarction patients were analyzed. The patients were grouped according to their clinical status on arrival at hospital. A modified Forrester classification — subset II was divided according to the absence (IIa) or presence (IIb) of symptoms — was applied. Short- (14 days) and long-term (up to 10 years) survival was analyzed and 19 independent variables were included in the multivariate models.

Results

Short-term survival was 95.6% for subset I, 83.3% for subset IIa, 60% for subset IIb, 54.6% for subset III, and 34.8% for subset IV (P < 0.001). By multiple regression analysis, lower clinical subsets (P < 0.001), fewer coronary arteries with disease (P = 0.006), younger age (P = 0.014), absence of reinfarction (P = 0.034), longer interval between streptokinase infusion and coronary arteriography (P = 0.016), and higher left ventricular ejection fraction (P = 0.037) demonstrated significant and independent correlation with short-term survival. Long-term survival for the total population was 71 ± 3.6% for subset I, 54.4 ± 8.5% for subset IIa, 20.8 ± 9.4% for subset IIb, 54.5 ± 15% for subset III, and 0% for subset IV (P < 0.001). Using Cox regression analysis, lower clinical subsets (P < 0.001), younger age (P < 0.001), higher global left ventricular ejection fraction (P < 0.001), and fewer coronary arteries with disease (P = 0.021) correlated independently and significantly with long-term survival. When excluding data from patients who died before the short-term follow-up (n = 532), lower clinical subsets remained an important predictor of long-term survival (P < 0.001).

Conclusion

Clinical classification at hospital presentation is a powerful predictor of short- and long-term survival post-myocardial infarction.

### Medication-overuse headache: a review [^114bxHxW]. Journal of Pain Research (2014). Low credibility.

Classification of headache disorders and MOH

Headache is a subjective symptom, and no laboratory tests or other objective tests are available to diagnose headache. Classification and diagnostic criteria are therefore of essential importance both in clinical practice and research settings. Until 1960, headache diagnoses and studies were based on nonuniform descriptions of symptomatology. Diagnostic criteria for headache were first presented in 1962 when an ad hoc committee of the National Institutes of Health published a first set of criteria. In 1988, the International Headache Society (IHS) published a classification system that became the standard for headache diagnosis: Classification and diagnostic criteria for headache disorders, cranial neuralgias and facial pain. In the 1988 edition, the diagnosis "headache induced by chronic substance use or exposure" was taken into the classification. In 2004, a second edition "The International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD-II)" was published, and the term "medication-overuse headache" was introduced. To be more applicable to patients in clinical practice, the diagnostic criteria for MOH were revised twice for the ICHD-II.–Before the last revision, MOH should paradoxically be entitled as "probable MOH" until overuse was discontinued, and then, if the patient improved after detoxification, given a definite MOH diagnosis. This meant that the patient could not receive a definite diagnosis of MOH until after a successful withdrawal of medication, following which she/he would no longer have MOH.

In 2013, a new version, "The International Classification of Headache Disorders 3rd beta edition (ICHD-IIIb)", was published, taking these changes to MOH into account.

According to the ICHD-IIIb, "MOH is headache occurring on 15 or more days per month developing as a consequence of regular overuse of acute or symptomatic headache medication (on 10 or more, or 15 or more days per month, depending on the medication) for more than 3 months. It usually, but not invariably, resolves after the overuse is stopped" (Figure 1). With the present criteria, MOH can be diagnosed immediately, and independently of withdrawal.

MOH is classified as a secondary chronic headache, but whether MOH is a primary or secondary headache is still under debate, and the concept of medication-overuse in other secondary headaches is unclear. Further, the concept of chronic migraine with medication-overuse is probably one of the most disputed aspects of the classification.

### International classification of diseases-9th revision coding for preeclampsia: how accurate is it? [^113NnKbg]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of the International Classification of Diseases-9th revision codes for preeclampsia and eclampsia.

Study Design

The University of Illinois Medical Center at Chicago discharge database was used to identify 135 women from 1999 through 2001 whose disease was coded as having preeclampsia or eclampsia. With American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology criteria as the gold standard, the diagnosis that was determined through chart review was compared with the International Classification of Diseases-9th revision code that was present in the discharge database. Patients were classified as true cases if the International Classification of Diseases-9th revision code matched the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists diagnosis; the positive predictive value of the code was then calculated.

Results

The overall positive predictive value for the complete sample was only 54%, but the positive predictive value for severe preeclampsia was 84.8%, which was high compared with mild preeclampsia (45.3%) and eclampsia (41.7%). Diagnostic (clinician) error was the most common reason for miscoding error.

Conclusion

The findings suggest that International Classification of Diseases-9th revision codes for preeclampsia/eclampsia vary greatly in their accuracy of diagnosis. Therefore, a review of medical records is required when data are being gathered on the incidence of preeclampsia and eclampsia.

### Definition and classification of chronic pancreatitis [^114dRgk6]. World Journal of Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

Chronic pancreatitis has been defined by features that are clinical and etiologic in origin. From such definitions a number of classifications have been developed, starting with the Marseille Classification in 1963. Defining features of chronic pancreatitis must consider the etiology of the disease, which then presents characteristic clinical evidence through symptomatic sequelae of organ pathology, including complications of the disease. Advancing technology has improved the imaging capabilities available to document derangements of the pancreas. The main purpose of international classifications of disease states is to provide a common language for purposes of clinical, research, and health outcomes studies. Modification of the 10th World Health Organization I.C.D. classification may provide this tool.

### Improving model fairness in image-based computer-aided diagnosis [^116E9Fve]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Deep learning has become a popular tool for computer-aided diagnosis using medical images, sometimes matching or exceeding the performance of clinicians. However, these models can also reflect and amplify human bias, potentially resulting inaccurate missed diagnoses. Despite this concern, the problem of improving model fairness in medical image classification by deep learning has yet to be fully studied. To address this issue, we propose an algorithm that leverages the marginal pairwise equal opportunity to reduce bias in medical image classification. Our evaluations across four tasks using four independent large-scale cohorts demonstrate that our proposed algorithm not only improves fairness in individual and intersectional subgroups but also maintains overall performance. Specifically, the relative change in pairwise fairness difference between our proposed model and the baseline model was reduced by over 35%, while the relative change in AUC value was typically within 1%. By reducing the bias generated by deep learning models, our proposed approach can potentially alleviate concerns about the fairness and reliability of image-based computer-aided diagnosis.

### Diagnosis and evaluation of hypersensitivity pneumonitis: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^113Ca8Ky]. Chest (2021). High credibility.

HP classification approach — panel discussion: The evidence from the studies included in this analysis is of very low-quality. As a whole, this evidence suggests that the extent of HRCT fibrotic change in HP has prognostic value. The present analysis indicates that the classification of HP cases should also include a designation of IA likelihood since the evidence suggests that IA status has implications for management and prognosis. Additionally, the data suggest that a time-based classification alone does not provide information on an individual patient's prognosis or longitudinal disease behavior and does not aid in appropriate treatment planning or assist in enhancing diagnostic accuracy. The suggestive interpretation of symptom type and duration and inclusion of phenotypically similar conditions under broad categories such as "chronic", symptoms > 6 months, or "acute", symptoms < 6 months have been reported to lead to clinical uncertainty and diagnostic confusion. Therefore, the guideline panel suggests that for clinical purposes and the design of future research, patients should be classified based on recognized prognostic indicators such as the presence or absence of pulmonary fibrosis.

### Sensitive troponin assay and the classification of myocardial infarction [^114vYaE9]. The American Journal of Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Clinical Significance

- Lowering the diagnostic threshold for troponin preferentially increases the number of patients identified with type 2 myocardial infarction or myocardial injury.
- Patients reclassified as having type 2 myocardial infarction or myocardial injury remained in the hospital for longer and were more likely to undergo cardiac investigations but, in contrast to type 1 myocardial infarction, were discharged without additional cardiac therapies and clinical outcomes remained poor and unchanged.

The Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction proposes a classification for patients with myocardial infarction based on cause to accommodate more sensitive markers of myocardial necrosis. The classification differentiates between type 1 myocardial infarction, due to thrombosis of an atherosclerotic plaque, and type 2 myocardial infarction, due to an imbalance of myocardial blood supply and demand that may arise in many acute medical and surgical conditions. The expert consensus further defines evidence of myocardial necrosis in the absence of clinical evidence of myocardial ischemia as myocardial injury. Although this classification has been used in recent clinical trials to refine clinical outcomes, type 2 myocardial infarction and myocardial injury are difficult to distinguish or diagnose definitively, and the frequency in clinical practice and implications of these diagnoses are uncertain.

After improvements in assay performance, a sensitive troponin assay was introduced into our institution. The validation and subsequent implementation of this assay provided an opportunity to assess the impact of lowering the diagnostic threshold on the incidence, management, and clinical outcome of patients with type 2 myocardial infarction and myocardial injury.

### Further evolution of the ACC / AHA clinical practice guideline recommendation classification system: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines [^115MJgUK]. Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

ACC/AHA guideline recommendation classification — evolution in context describes that in some cases, clinical benefit is self-evident and randomized study is unlikely, so when available data are weak, conflicting, or absent, lower level of evidence recommendations may still guide care, yet greater emphasis is now placed on higher-quality evidence and limiting lower-quality evidence. The modifications align with recommendations promulgated by the Institute of Medicine in 2011 and aim to facilitate comparison of the strength (COR) and quality (LOE) categories with other developers, increasing the granularity and precision of the ACC/AHA system while broadly retaining familiar COR and LOE categories. The changes support comprehensive, objective assessment of all available evidence and delivery of recommendations in a uniform format useful at the point of care, with ongoing challenges including developing standardized criteria for quality of evidence, incorporating cost and health economic methodology, improving processes for revising and updating as new evidence emerges, and creating tools to integrate context-sensitive recommendations with electronic health records; the structured classification system spans these initiatives and remains central to the guidelines.

Experts on gastric, small bowel and colonic motility disorders first developed statements regarding evaluation of transit and contractility of the respective segments of the gastro intestinal tract, which were based on already available consensus statements. Consensus statements from other gastrointestinal societies or expert groups were searched for and included when appropriate, for example, if they were published more recently or if they covered relevant areas not specifically addressed in the previous documents. Moreover, an updated literature search using PubMed and Medline was performed centrally by the corresponding author (J.K.) with additions from the co-authors. The literature search started on the date specified as the end date of the liteature searches performed for two previously published consensus papers, (that is, 1 Jan 2008 for intraluminal measurements of gastrointestinal motility and 1 Jan 2010 for transit tests); the search covered the period until 14 Apr 2016 and was generally limited to human studies. The literature search revealed 1,111 publications, of which 202 were selected on the basis of study quality (which did not include a formal evaluation, but the level of evidence was assessed in line with the Oxford Centre for Evidence-based Medicine and were made available to all authors. Low-quality studies were also considered if the topic was deemed relevant and not covered otherwise. The literature search on gastric emptying included the following terms, revealing 624 papers: "gastric emptying", "gastro paresis", "dumping", "measurement", "test", "evaluation" and "diagnosis". The literature search on intra luminal tests of gastric motility included the following terms, revealing 67 papers: "gastric", "antral", "antroduodenal", "antroduodenojejunal", "motility", "contraction", "intraluminal" and "manometry". The literature search on small bowel transit included the following terms, revealing 130 papers: "orocaecal transit", "OCCT", "small bowel transit", "intestinal transit", "measurement", "test", "evaluation", "diagnosis", "sensitivity" and "specificity". The literature search on intraluminal tests of small bowel motility included the following terms, revealing 13 papers: "small bowel", "antroduodenal", "antroduodenojejunal", "intestinal", "intraluminal", "motility" and "manometry".

### Anorectal emergencies: WSES-AAST guidelines [^113wqj5y]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2021). High credibility.

Regarding classification and risk stratification for Fournier's gangrene, more specifically with respect to risk stratification, AAST/WSES 2021 guidelines recommend to consider using Laboratory Risk Indicator for Necrotising Fasciitis score for an early diagnosis and Fournier's Gangrene Severity Index for prognosis and risk stratification of patients with suspected Fournier's gangrene.

### Interphysician agreement on subclassification of myocardial infarction [^115JtVy7]. Heart (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusion

The results from this study indicate that the current classification of MI and myocardial injury subtypes presented in the third universal definition of MI is indistinct. Even for specially trained reviewers, with access to all clinical information retrospectively, this classification only gave a moderate rate of agreement in deciding the diagnosis, suggesting that this classification is also very challenging for a practicing clinician. Thus, there is a need for more precise and clinically applicable criteria for the current classification, especially for type 2 MI diagnosis and myocardial injury.

### Perianal fistulizing Crohn's disease: utilizing the TOpClass classification in clinical practice to provide targeted individualized care [^115sfp24]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background & Aims

Perianal fistulation is a challenging phenotype of Crohn's disease, with significant impact on quality of life. Historically, fistulae have been classified anatomically in relation to the sphincter complex, and management guidelines have been generalized, with lack of attention to the clinical heterogenicity seen. The recent 'TOpClass classification system' for perianal fistulizing Crohn's disease (PFCD) addresses this issue, and classifies patients into defined groups, which provide a focus for fistula management that aligns with disease characteristics and patient goals. In this article, we discuss the clinical applicability of the TOpClass model and provide direction on its use in clinical practice.

Methods

An international group of perianal clinicians participated in an expert consensus to define how the TOpClass system can be incorporated into real-life practice. This included gastroenterologists, inflammatory bowel disease surgeons, and radiologists specialized in PFCD. The process was informed by the multi-disciplinary team management of 8 high-volume fistula centres in North America, Europe, and Australia.

Results

The process produced position statements to accompany the classification system and guide PFCD management. The statements range from the management of patients with quiescent perianal disease to those with severe PFCD requiring diverting-ostomy and/or proctectomy. The optimization of medical therapies, as well as the use of surgery, in fistula closure and symptom management is explored across each classification group.

Conclusion

This article provides an overview of the system's use in clinical practice. It aims to enable clinicians to have a pragmatic and patient goal-centered approach to medical and surgical management options for individual patients with PFCD.

### Guideline no. 444: hirsutism: evaluation and treatment [^117DahvM]. Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Canada (2023). High credibility.

Regarding classification and risk stratification for hirsutism, more specifically with respect to severity assessment, SOGC 2023 guidelines recommend to consider using the modified Ferriman-Gallwey score in the assessment of hirsutism to help quantify the problem and help assess treatment response. Classify cases into the following categories, recognizing that cut-off scores defining hirsutism will vary by racial background:

| **Situation** | **Guidance** |
|-|-|
|Mild|- < 15|
|Moderate|- 16–25|
|Severe|- > 25.|

### Classification of acute pancreatitis – 2012: revision of the Atlanta classification and definitions by international consensus [^115Mw43a]. Gut (2013). Low credibility.

Background and Objective

The Atlanta classification of acute pancreatitis enabled standardised reporting of research and aided communication between clinicians. Deficiencies identified and improved understanding of the disease make a revision necessary.

Methods

A web-based consultation was undertaken in 2007 to ensure wide participation of pancreatologists. After an initial meeting, the Working Group sent a draft document to 11 national and international pancreatic associations. This working draft was forwarded to all members. Revisions were made in response to comments, and the web-based consultation was repeated three times. The final consensus was reviewed, and only statements based on published evidence were retained.

Results

The revised classification of acute pancreatitis identified two phases of the disease: early and late. Severity is classified as mild, moderate or severe. Mild acute pancreatitis, the most common form, has no organ failure, local or systemic complications and usually resolves in the first week. Moderately severe acute pancreatitis is defined by the presence of transient organ failure, local complications or exacerbation of co-morbid disease. Severe acute pancreatitis is defined by persistent organ failure, that is, organ failure > 48 h. Local complications are peripancreatic fluid collections, pancreatic and peripancreatic necrosis (sterile or infected), pseudocyst and walled-off necrosis (sterile or infected). We present a standardised template for reporting CT images.

Conclusions

This international, web-based consensus provides clear definitions to classify acute pancreatitis using easily identified clinical and radiologic criteria. The wide consultation among pancreatologists to reach this consensus should encourage widespread adoption.

### Patterns of medical diagnoses before and after a diagnosis of anorexia nervosa: a Danish nationwide cohort study [^1161tZnt]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

3.3 Outcome Measures

From the DNPR we retrieved data on all medical diagnosis codes registered for both the AN and the comparison cohort from 1977 to 2018. We classified the diagnoses into 12 categories according to the ICD‐10 classification, and the ICD‐8 codes were grouped according to this classification (see Table S1 for ICD‐10 and ICD‐8 codes used). Based on a literature review, we identified relevant sub‐diagnoses in each category for example, endocrine, nutritional, and metabolic diseases (Misra and Klibanski), circulatory system disorders (Fayssoil, Melchior, and Hanachi), musculoskeletal disorders and disorders of the digestive system (Gibson, Workman, and Mehler). For both the AN cohort and the comparison cohort we included all medical diagnoses registered with 10‐year look‐back from index date, as well as all diagnoses registered from index date until end of follow‐up. Furthermore, we created a variable that included all medical diagnoses.

From the PCR and the DNPR, we retrieved data on other EDs diagnosis registered before index date and we grouped them into a variable including any other ED diagnosis (bulimia, ED‐unspecified or other ED) (Table S2).

3.4 Statistical Analysis

We tabulated the baseline characteristics of the study population, which included sex and age at index date (6–18 years, 19+ years). We calculated the median age at index date, and the median follow‐up time after index date with interquartile range (IQR). We calculated the number of patients with a diagnosis code of any other ED prior to the AN diagnosis as well as the median time from diagnosis of any other ED until index date with IQR.

### New appendix criteria open for a broader concept of chronic migraine [^111ygq9y]. Cephalalgia (2006). Low credibility.

After the introduction of chronic migraine and medication overuse headache as diagnostic entities in The International Classification of Headache Disorders, Second Edition, ICHD-2, it has been shown that very few patients fit into the diagnostic criteria for chronic migraine (CM). The system of being able to use CM and the medication overuse headache (MOH) diagnosis only after discontinuation of overuse has proven highly unpractical and new data have suggested a much more liberal use of these diagnoses. The International Headache Classification Committee has, therefore, worked out the more inclusive criteria for CM and MOH presented in this paper. These criteria are included in the appendix of ICHD-2 and are meant primarily for further scientific evaluation but may be used already now for inclusion into drug trials, etc. It is now recommended that the MOH diagnosis should no longer request improvement after discontinuation of medication overuse but should be given to patients if they have a primary headache plus ongoing medication overuse. The latter is defined as previously, i.e. 10 days or more of intake of triptans, ergot alkaloids mixed analgesics or opioids and 15 days or more of analgesics/NSAIDs or the combined use of more than one substance. If these new criteria for CM and MOH prove useful in future testing, the plan is to include them in a future revised version of ICHD-2.

### ACMT position statement: allow optimal treatment for healthcare professionals with opioid use disorder [^113mX3wK]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2022). High credibility.

Opioid use disorder does not equal impairment — The Federation of State Medical Boards (FSMB) states that substance use disorder causes impairment when a healthcare professional is unable to provide medical care with reasonable skill and safety, and describes impairment as a functional classification existing on a continuum that can change over time; with treatment, impairment may be resolved even while the substance use disorder diagnosis remains, distinguishing diagnosis from functional impairment in practice.

### Guidelines for the management of severe traumatic brain injury, fourth edition [^115RUPX3]. Neurosurgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Evidence classification and recommendation levels — Level II B or III recommendations were based on the Class of studies; specifically, Level II B recommendations were based on a body of evidence with Class 2 studies, with direct evidence but of overall low quality, and Level III recommendations were based on Class 3 studies, or on Class 2 studies providing only indirect evidence. Applicability could result in a Level III recommendation, but in this edition, applicability alone was not used to downgrade a recommendation. "Insufficient" was used when no studies were identified or when the body of evidence had major quality limitations; if the evidence was insufficient, no recommendations were made.

### Management of proximal humeral fractures in the nineteenth century: an historical review of preradiographic sources [^116voWhj]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2011). Low credibility.

Background

The diagnosis and treatment of fractures of the proximal humerus have troubled patients and medical practitioners since antiquity. Preradiographic diagnosis relied on surface anatomy, pain localization, crepitus, and impaired function. During the nineteenth century, a more thorough understanding of the pathoanatomy and pathophysiology of proximal humeral fractures was obtained, and new methods of reduction and bandaging were developed.

Questions/Purposes

I reviewed nineteenth-century principles of (1) diagnosis, (2) classification, (3) reduction, (4) bandaging, and (5) concepts of displacement in fractures of the proximal humerus.

Methods

A narrative review of nineteenth-century surgical texts is presented. Sources were identified by searching bibliographic databases, orthopaedic sourcebooks, textbooks in medical history, and a subsequent hand search.

Results

Substantial progress in understanding fractures of the proximal humerus is found in nineteenth-century textbooks. A rational approach to understanding fractures of the proximal humerus was made possible by an appreciation of the underlying functional anatomy and subsequent pathoanatomy. Thus, new principles of diagnosis, pathoanatomic classifications, modified methods of reduction, functional bandaging, and advanced concepts of displacement were proposed, challenging the classic management adhered to for more than 2000 years.

Conclusions

The principles for modern pathoanatomic and pathophysiologic understanding of proximal humeral fractures and the principles for classification, nonsurgical treatment, and bandaging were established in the preradiographic era.

### Principles of artificial intelligence and its application in cardiovascular medicine [^114RaYnb]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Artificial intelligence (AI) represents a rapidly developing field. Its use can improve diagnosis and therapy in many areas of medicine. Despite this enormous progress, many physicians perceive it as a black box and are skeptical about it. This review will present the basics of machine learning. Different classifications of artificial intelligence, such as supervised versus unsupervised and discriminative versus generative AI, are given. Analogies to human intelligence are discussed as far as algorithms are oriented toward it. In the second step, the most common models like random forest, k‐means clustering, convolutional neural network, and transformers will be presented in a way that the underlying idea can be understood. Corresponding medical applications in cardiovascular medicine will be named for all models, respectively. The overview is intended to show that the term artificial intelligence covers a wide range of different concepts. It should help physicians understand the principles of AI to make up one's minds about its application in cardiology. It should also enable them to evaluate results obtained with AI's help critically.

### ASRM Müllerian anomalies classification 2021 [^111ibtxW]. Fertility and Sterility (2021). High credibility.

ASRM müllerian anomalies classification 2021 — development objectives state that a new classification was needed and the ASRM Task Force on Müllerian Anomaly Classification was formed to update the American Fertility Society (AFS) classification after reviewing existing classifications and assessing their advantages and disadvantages. It was determined that an ideal classification should improve identification of müllerian anomalies, enhance communication between providers and researchers, and ultimately improve clinical care. The Task Force recognized that only some uterine anomalies and no cervical and vaginal anomalies were captured in the old classification and set a goal to expand the classification to include uterine, cervical, and vaginal anomalies. The group emphasized that the spectrum of müllerian anomalies is a continuum with need for overlap between categories, that currently recognized anomalies do not reflect all possible abnormalities, and that the classification should not be considered complete. The classification should be able to incorporate changes and additions over time.

### Instructions for classifying multiple causes of death, 2022-section IV… [^116NuNJh]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Instructions for Classifying Multiple Causes of Death, 2022 – Section IV SECTION IV
- CLASSIFICATION OF CERTAIN ICD CATEGORIES __General information__ Separate categories are provided in ICD-10 for coding malignant primary and secondary neoplasms, carcinoma in situ, benign neoplasms, and neoplasms of uncertain or unknown behavior. Categories and subcategories within these groups identify sites and/or morphological types. Morphology describes the difference in type and structure of cells or tissues as seen under the microscope and behavior. The ICD classification of neoplasms consists of several major morphological groups of neoplasms including the following: Carcinomas including squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma Sarcomas and other soft tissue tumors including mesotheliomas. All combinations of the order of prefixes in compound morphological terms are not indexed.

For example, the term "chondrofibrosarcoma" does not appear in the Index, but "fibrochondrosarcoma" does. Since the two terms have the same prefixes, code the chondrofibrosarcoma the same as fibrochondrosarcoma. for the reported term. Morphological types of neoplasm include categories C40-C41, C43, C44, C45, C46, C47, C49, C70-C72, and C80. Specific morphological types include: C40-C41 Malignant. I Secondary melanoma of lung C439 C780 Melanoma is classified to C43; therefore, when stated secondary of a site, code Melanoma, unspecified site and secondary neoplasm of the reported site. I Secondary carcinoma of intestine C785 The morphological type of the term "carcinoma" is C80; therefore, code a secondary neoplasm code only. I Acute lymphocytic leukemia C910 Non-Hodgkin lymphoma C859 __Code__ each as indexed since both are morphological types classified within the categories C81-C96.

I Chronic lymphocytic C911 C910 leukemia with blastic crisis.

### 2022 ACC / AHA guideline for the diagnosis and management of aortic disease: a report of the American Heart Association / American college of cardiology joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^113WjVEh]. Circulation (2022). High credibility.

American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association class of recommendation (COR) and level of evidence (LOE) — Updated May 2019 — define strength and evidentiary quality for clinical strategies. Class 1 (Strong) states "Benefit > > > Risk" with phrases such as "Is recommended", "Is indicated/useful/effective/beneficial", "Should be performed/administered/other", and comparative language "Treatment/strategy A is recommended/indicated in preference to treatment B" and "Treatment A should be chosen over treatment B". Class 2a (Moderate) denotes "Benefit > > Risk", using "Is reasonable", "Can be useful/effective/beneficial", and comparative phrases "Treatment/strategy A is probably recommended/indicated in preference to treatment B" and "It is reasonable to choose treatment A over treatment B". Class 2b (Weak) reflects "Benefit ≥ Risk", with "May/might be reasonable", "May/might be considered", and that "Usefulness/effectiveness is unknown/unclear/uncertain or not well-established". Class 3: No Benefit (Moderate) shows "Benefit = Risk (Generally, LOE A or B use only)" with "Is not recommended", "Is not indicated/useful/effective/beneficial", and "Should not be performed/administered/other", while Class 3: Harm (Strong) is "Risk > Benefit" with "Potentially harmful", "Causes harm", "Associated with excess morbidity/mortality", and "Should not be performed/administered/other". LOE categories specify Level A ("High-quality evidence‡ from more than 1 RCT; Meta-analyses of high-quality RCTs; One or more RCTs corroborated by high-quality registry studies"), Level B-R and B-NR ("Moderate-quality evidence‡ from 1 or more RCTs; Meta-analyses of moderate-quality RCTs" and "Moderate-quality evidence‡ from 1 or more well-designed, well-executed nonrandomized studies, observational studies, or registry studies; Meta-analyses of such studies"), and Level C-LD and C-EO ("Randomized or nonrandomized observational or registry studies with limitations of design or execution; Meta-analyses of such studies; Physiological or mechanistic studies in human subjects" and "Consensus of expert opinion based on clinical experience"). Notes clarify that "COR and LOE are determined independently (any COR may be paired with any LOE)", that "A recommendation with LOE C does not imply that the recommendation is weak", and that for comparative-effectiveness recommendations "(COR 1 and 2a; LOE A and B only)… should involve direct comparisons of the treatments or strategies being evaluated".

### Guidelines for the management of severe traumatic brain injury, fourth edition [^117VoRD4]. Neurosurgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Severe traumatic brain injury guidelines — evidence classes and threshold-related criteria are described as follows: Class 1 Evidence is derived from randomized controlled trials, though some may be poorly designed, lack sufficient patient numbers, or suffer from other methodological inadequacies that render them Class 2 or 3. Class 2 Evidence is derived from cohort studies including prospective, retrospective, and case-control, with the requirement that comparison of two or more groups must be clearly distinguished, and class 2 evidence may also be derived from flawed RCTs. Class 3 Evidence is derived from case series, databases or registries, case reports, and expert opinion, and class 3 evidence may also be derived from flawed RCTs, cohort, or case-control studies. In the criteria table under Study Design or Type, listed items include: rationale for threshold value provided (either criteria stated a priori or specified that value would be derived from the data), monitoring technology is the same or equivalent for all patients, and treatment protocol is similar for similar patients (e.g., all patients at certain values received the same interventions).
