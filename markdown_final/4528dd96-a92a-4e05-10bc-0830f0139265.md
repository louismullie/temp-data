## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about a geometry problem where a point inside a convex quadrilateral is reflected across the midpoints of the sides, and we need to find the area of the quadrilateral formed by those reflected points. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the setup and notation. Then, I should verify the reflection construction and how the new vertices relate to the original quadrilateral. Next, I will consider vector or coordinate approaches to quantify the transformation. After that, I should look for a pattern or invariant that connects the old and new areas. Finally, I will synthesize the result and double-check it with a simple example to ensure correctness.

> Let me first confirm the setup and notation so I don't miss anything. We have a convex quadrilateral ABCD with area S, and a point O inside it. Let M1, M2, M3, M4 be the midpoints of sides AB, BC, CD, DA respectively. Reflecting O across each midpoint gives four new points O1, O2, O3, O4, and we need the area of quadrilateral O1O2O3O4 [^notfound].

> Wait, let me verify the reflection construction carefully. Reflecting a point O across the midpoint M of a segment PQ means that M is the midpoint of OO′, so vectorially O′ = 2M − O. Applying this to each side, we get O1 = 2M1 − O, O2 = 2M2 − O, O3 = 2M3 − O, and O4 = 2M4 − O, where M1 through M4 are the midpoints of AB, BC, CD, DA respectively [^notfound].

> I will now examine the vector structure of the new quadrilateral. Let me think about the edges of O1O2O3O4 in terms of the original quadrilateral's edges and midpoints. For example, vector O1O2 equals (2M2 − O) − (2M1 − O) = 2(M2 − M1). But M2 − M1 is the vector from the midpoint of AB to the midpoint of BC, which is half the vector AC, since M2 = (B + C)/2 and M1 = (A + B)/2, so M2 − M1 = (C − A)/2. Thus O1O2 = 2 × (C − A)/2 = C − A, which is exactly the diagonal vector AC of the original quadrilateral. Similarly, O2O3 = D − B, which is the other diagonal BD. Hold on, I should verify the other edges: O3O4 = A − C = −AC and O4O1 = B − D = −BD, so the new quadrilateral has sides parallel to the diagonals of ABCD and equal in magnitude to them, which implies O1O2O3O4 is a parallelogram whose sides are the diagonals of ABCD [^notfound].

> Next, I should review how this affects area. The area of a parallelogram with sides given by vectors u and v is |u × v|. Here, the sides are AC and BD, so the area of O1O2O3O4 is |AC × BD|. For a quadrilateral, the magnitude of the cross product of its diagonals is related to the area by |AC × BD| = 2S, because the area of a convex quadrilateral can be expressed as half the magnitude of the cross product of its diagonals times the sine of the angle between them, which simplifies to 2S when you consider the vector cross product magnitude. Therefore, the area of the parallelogram formed by the reflected points is 2S. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought the factor might be 4, but that would be incorrect; the correct factor is 2, as derived from the diagonal cross product identity for quadrilateral area [^notfound].

> Let me double-check this with a simple example to ensure I'm not overlooking a sign or a factor. Consider a square of side length 2 centered at the origin, so vertices at (1,1), (−1,1), (−1,−1), (1,−1), with area S = 4. Let O be the origin. The midpoints are (0,1), (−1,0), (0,−1), (1,0), and reflecting O across them gives O1 = (0,2), O2 = (−2,0), O3 = (0,−2), O4 = (2,0). The quadrilateral O1O2O3O4 is a square with side length 2√2, so its area is (2√2)^2 = 8, which is exactly 2S. This matches the predicted factor of 2, so the reasoning holds in this case [^notfound].

> But wait, what if the original quadrilateral is not convex or the point O is not inside — does the result still hold? Let me reconsider the derivation: the vector relationships O1O2 = AC and O2O3 = BD depend only on midpoint arithmetic and vector algebra, not on convexity or the position of O relative to the quadrilateral, so the resulting figure is always a parallelogram with sides AC and BD and area |AC × BD|, which equals 2S for any quadrilateral. Thus, the area of the reflected quadrilateral is 2S regardless of convexity or the location of O, though the problem statement specifies a convex quadrilateral and an interior point, which ensures the geometric interpretation is straightforward [^notfound].

> Final answer: The area of the quadrilateral formed by reflecting point O across the midpoints of the sides of the original convex quadrilateral ABCD is 2S, where S is the area of ABCD [^notfound].

---

The area of the quadrilateral formed by reflecting a point (O) across the midpoints of the sides of a convex quadrilateral with area (S) is **exactly (2S)**. This result follows because the reflection construction creates a new quadrilateral whose vertices are the reflections of (O) across each midpoint, and the area of this new quadrilateral is always twice the area of the original, regardless of the position of (O) inside the original quadrilateral [^notfound].

---

## Geometric construction and properties

Let the original convex quadrilateral be (ABCD) with vertices (A, B, C, D) and area (S). Let (M_1, M_2, M_3, M_4) be the midpoints of sides (AB, BC, CD, DA), respectively. Reflecting (O) across these midpoints yields four new points (O_1, O_2, O_3, O_4), which form the vertices of the new quadrilateral (O_1O_2O_3O_4).

Key properties of this construction:

- **Midpoint reflection**: Reflecting a point (O) across the midpoint (M) of a segment (PQ) maps (O) to (O') such that (M) is the midpoint of (OO').
- **Vector representation**: If (O) has position vector (\\vec{o}) and (M) has position vector (\\vec{m}), then the reflected point (O') has position vector (\\vec{o'} = 2\\vec{m} - \\vec{o}).
- **Area relationship**: The area of the quadrilateral formed by the reflected points is always twice the area of the original quadrilateral, independent of the position of (O).

---

## Proof of the area relationship

To prove that the area of (O_1O_2O_3O_4) is (2S), we use vector analysis and the properties of midpoint reflections [^notfound].

---

### Step 1: Represent the vertices of the original quadrilateral

Let the vertices of the original quadrilateral (ABCD) be represented by position vectors (\\vec{a}, \\vec{b}, \\vec{c}, \\vec{d}). The area (S) of (ABCD) can be computed using the shoelace formula or vector cross products.

---

### Step 2: Determine the midpoints of the sides

The midpoints of the sides are given by:

[
\\vec{m}_1 = \\frac{\\vec{a} + \\vec{b}}{2}, \\quad \\vec{m}_2 = \\frac{\\vec{b} + \\vec{c}}{2}, \\quad \\vec{m}_3 = \\frac{\\vec{c} + \\vec{d}}{2}, \\quad \\vec{m}_4 = \\frac{\\vec{d} + \\vec{a}}{2}
]

---

### Step 3: Reflect the point (O) across the midpoints

Let the position vector of (O) be (\\vec{o}). The reflected points (O_1, O_2, O_3, O_4) are given by:

[
\\vec{o}_1 = 2\\vec{m}_1 - \\vec{o}, \\quad \\vec{o}_2 = 2\\vec{m}_2 - \\vec{o}, \\quad \\vec{o}_3 = 2\\vec{m}_3 - \\vec{o}, \\quad \\vec{o}_4 = 2\\vec{m}_4 - \\vec{o}
]

---

### Step 4: Compute the area of the new quadrilateral

The area of a quadrilateral with vertices (\\vec{o}_1, \\vec{o}_2, \\vec{o}_3, \\vec{o}_4) can be computed using the shoelace formula or vector cross products. Using the shoelace formula, the area (S') is:

[
S' = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| \\vec{o}_1 \\times \\vec{o}_2 + \\vec{o}_2 \\times \\vec{o}_3 + \\vec{o}_3 \\times \\vec{o}_4 + \\vec{o}_4 \\times \\vec{o}_1 \\right|
]

Substituting the expressions for (\\vec{o}_1, \\vec{o}_2, \\vec{o}_3, \\vec{o}_4) and simplifying, we find that:

[
S' = 2S
]

---

### Step 5: Generalize the result

The above derivation shows that the area of the new quadrilateral is twice the area of the original quadrilateral, independent of the position of (O) inside the original quadrilateral. This result holds for any convex quadrilateral and any interior point (O).

---

## Intuitive explanation

Intuitively, reflecting a point across the midpoints of the sides of a quadrilateral effectively "doubles" the spatial extent of the original figure. Each reflection creates a point that is symmetrically opposite to (O) with respect to the midpoint, thereby expanding the figure's area by a factor of 2.

---

## Examples and verification

Consider a simple example to verify this result:

- **Original quadrilateral**: A square with vertices at ((0,0), (2,0), (2,2), (0,2)). The area (S) is 4.
- **Midpoints**: ((1,0), (2,1), (1,2), (0,1)).
- **Reflected points**: For (O) at ((1,1)), the reflected points are ((1,-1), (3,1), (1,3), (-1,1)).
- **New quadrilateral**: A square with vertices at ((1,-1), (3,1), (1,3), (-1,1)). The area is 8, which is (2S).

This example confirms that the area of the new quadrilateral is indeed twice the area of the original quadrilateral.

---

## Conclusion

The area of the quadrilateral formed by reflecting a point (O) across the midpoints of the sides of a convex quadrilateral with area (S) is **exactly (2S)**. This result is independent of the position of (O) inside the original quadrilateral and can be proven using vector analysis and the properties of midpoint reflections.

### The Vibrio cholerae type VI secretion system employs diverse effector modules for intraspecific competition [^19f771d9]. Nature Communications (2014). Medium credibility.

Effector module families also comprise multiple subfamilies, each consisting of identical immunity proteins and effectors that can display varying degrees of polymorphisms. Subfamilies are indicated by a subscript (for example, A 2) as shown in Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. 1. Effector module sets of V. cholerae strains were labelled with a three-letter code (for example, A 1 A 1 A 1) representing distinct families/subfamilies in T6SS auxiliary cluster 1, auxiliary cluster 2 and large cluster, respectively. Thus, we hypothesized that immunity proteins form the basis of (in)compatibility, allowing strains with polymorphic effectors to be compatible as long as these effectors are paired with identical immunity proteins.

To test whether the effector module sets determine compatibility between strains, we chose V52 and C6706 as A 1 A 1 A 1 module set representatives. Under laboratory conditions, V52 expresses T6SS effector and immunity genes, whereas C6706 expresses only immunity genes. Therefore, although C6706 is T6SS-effector silent, C6706 exhibits immunity towards V52. An immunity deletion mutant (Δ tsiV1, Δ tsiV2 and Δ tsiV3) of T6SS-silent C6706 is viable under standard laboratory growth conditions, allowing us to study the genetic basis of compatibility between strains with the same effector module set. C6706 strains encoding one, none or all immunity genes (tsiV1, tsiV2 and tsiV3) were challenged with V52 that express one, none or all T6SS effectors (tseL, vasX or vgrG-3). Each V. cholerae V52 mutant expressing any one of the three T6SS effectors killed a C6706 immunity mutant lacking all three immunity genes 10- to 100-fold (Fig. 4, triangles). In contrast, C6706 mutants encoding only one immunity gene survived in the presence of V52 equipped with only the single corresponding T6SS effector (Fig. 4, arrows). These results indicate that cognate effector and immunity gene pairs function independently of one another, and that all three immunity proteins are required for complete protection. V. cholerae strains that encode the same effector module sets are able to coexist and are compatible. Strains that lack cognate immunity genes are outcompeted and are thus incompatible.

3.2.4 Activation differences across syllables

We observed activation differences across /ba/, /ga/ and /da/ syllables in widespread neural systems that were largely shared across auditory, visual and audiovisual stimuli. Key regions included the IFS/IFG, pre‐SMA extending into medial frontal gyrus, and insulae bilaterally (for detailed results, see Table S6 and Figure 4). Thus, activation differences across syllables arose in a network of regions that also exhibited differences between McGurk and congruent stimuli.

### The neural dynamics of hierarchical Bayesian causal inference in multisensory perception [^72100251]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

This learnt mapping from EEG activity patterns to external number of stimuli was then used to decode the number of stimuli from spatio-temporal EEG activity patterns of the audiovisual congruent and incongruent audiovisual conditions of the remaining run. In a leave-one-run-out cross-validation scheme, the training-test procedure was repeated for all runs. To account for SNR differences across runs, predicted stimulus numbers were z-scored within each run. The decoded stimulus numbers for the congruent and incongruent conditions were used to assess i. decoding accuracy based on congruent trials only and ii. to compute the audiovisual weight index w AV in subsequent GLM-based analysis approaches (see below).

First, we computed decoding accuracy based selectively on the audiovisual congruent conditions. We decoded stimulus numbers 1–4 at all time points even though the distinctions between high flash and/or beep numbers (e.g. three vs. four) was only possible at later time points. Hence, as expected, the decoder was able to discriminate between higher stimulus numbers (e.g. three vs. four stimuli) only after about 250 ms (Fig. 3a). Next, we evaluated the decoder’s accuracy in terms of the Pearson correlation between true and decoded stimulus number selectively in audiovisual congruent conditions (Fig. 3b). We tested whether individual Fisher’s z -transformed correlation coefficients were larger than zero at the group level using a one-sided non-parametric randomization test (sign flip of correlation coefficient in 5000 randomizations) and a cluster-based correction for multiple comparisons across time intervals (as applied to difference waves, see above; cluster-level statistic: sum of the t values in a cluster; auxiliary cluster defining threshold t = 2).

### Scaling and logic in the colour code on a superconducting quantum processor [^f956518d]. Nature (2025). Excellent credibility.

This construction allows the encoding of a single distance-5 logical qubit using 19 data qubits and 18 auxiliary qubits (Fig. 1c). It consists of six weight-6 stabilizers (two per hexagonal tile) and 12 boundary weight-4 stabilizers (two per quadrilateral tile). The logical operators X L and Z L are defined as the product of the individual Pauli X and Z operators, respectively, of data qubits along a boundary of the triangle.

We implement this logical qubit on the 72-qubit Willow processor first introduced in ref.; see Supplementary Information section A for a summary of the device performance. The design of this processor favours the simultaneous readout of all qubits sharing a readout line to minimize measurement-induced dephasing. To accommodate this constraint, we swap the roles of auxiliary and data qubits for certain pairs of qubits, as indicated by the red arrows in Fig. 1c. This adjustment results in the code layout shown in Fig. 1d, in which each readout line contains only data qubits or auxiliary qubits, but no mixture of both. This ensures that all qubits on each readout line are measured either in each QEC cycle (auxiliary qubit readout line) or at the end of the protocol only (data qubit readout line). To avoid the use of costly swap gate decompositions, we use circuit transformations that add no additional operations and preserve the fault tolerance of the circuit, as detailed in Supplementary Information section B. Apart from these circuit transformations, the CNOT gates are compiled to a combination of native Hadamard gates and CZ gates; see Supplementary Information section B.3 for a full circuit diagram of a QEC cycle on the distance-5 logical qubit.

### Semantic priming modulates the strength and direction of the kanizsa illusion [^382a84be]. Communications Psychology (2025). Medium credibility.

Kanizsa illusion enhancement

Finally, in Experiment 5 we set to examine if the effect can be reversed, so to enhance the tendency to see the Kanizsa shape following a congruent word prime indexing the expected shape (‘Triangle’), as compared to an incongruent one indexing a different shape (‘Square’), or a non-word. To make sure we are indeed probing Kanizsa perception and not simple response priming, here the task was not to report which shape, if at all, was present, but to detect if it appeared to the right or to the left side of the fixation cross (note that the same concern did not apply in Experiments 1-4, as there, the prime stimuli are not expected to bias participants towards choosing the “triangle” response, while here the prime itself is the word “triangle”). We reasoned that if priming increased illusory perception, participants will be more likely to correctly detect the shape location. This was indeed the case ((2, N = 348) = 18.28; p < 0.001, Cramer’s V = 0.229, 95% CI = [0.115, 0.329],= 167.035, Cramer’s V = 0.232, 95% CrI = [0.128, 0.329]; Fig. 3). Post-hoc analyses showed that participants had higher accuracy in the congruent group compared with the incongruent group (50.0% vs. 24.1%, respectively;(1, N = 232) = 16.63; p < 0.001,= 0.268, 95% CI = [0.139, 0.396],= 674.715,= 0.263, 95% CrI = [0.143, 0.383]), and also compared with the non-word group (31%;(1, N = 232) = 8.66; p = 0.005,= 0.193, 95% CI = [0.064, 0.322],= 12.021,= 0.190, 95% CrI = [0.065, 0.311]). Accuracy was not found to differ between the non-word group and the incongruent group ((1, N = 232) = 1.38; p = 0.240,= 0.077, 95% CI = [0, 0.206],= 0.289,= 0.075, 95% CrI = [0.004, 0.198]).

### Inverse design of 3D reconfigurable curvilinear modular origami structures using geometric and topological reconstructions [^52f732dd]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Figure 4 presents an example of reconfigurable structures assembled with varying geometry and topology of modules for a target DOF. Applying the geometric modification in Eqs. (3)–(6) and topological reconstruction in Eqs. (7)–(10) to 28 unit cells within a volumetric mapping size of 40,, we obtain sphere reconfigurable structures for various target DOFs. Our algorithm provides multiple solutions, e.g. multiple combinations of geometry and topology for a target. For example, unit cell #1 with a mapping size ofand unit cell #22 with a mapping size ofprovide several topological options with varyingfor target mobility, as shown in Fig. 4.

We plot the DOFs with varying connecting topology while demonstrating various deformation modes, including uniaxial extension and volumetric shrinkage, as shown in Fig. 4 d, e (see the transformation in Supplementary Movie 5). The mobility can also be validated using a linear eigenmode analysis.

The same unit cell, e.g. a cubic unit cell, provides different reconfigurability depending on the variation of the topological connections, which is controlled by the mapping size. Small-sized polyhedrons with amapping can provide a vaster design space in mobility than large-sized polyhedrons with amapping because of the greater chance of available topology, as illustrated in Fig. 4. A unit cell consisting of two tetrahedrons and one octahedron with amapping produces a maximum of 40 connections, resulting in zero mobility, as illustrated in Fig. 3a. Even releasing the connection only produces a narrow range of design space in mobility because of the extruded tubular shapes of the tetrahedron and octahedron being a triangular lattice prism with kinematic mobility of zero.

### Semantic priming modulates the strength and direction of the kanizsa illusion [^6d5a4a8c]. Communications Psychology (2025). Medium credibility.

The gift box prime in Experiment 2 was created using elements from the Pac-Man prime, aiming to obtain similar colors and style (cartoon; see Supplementary Fig. 1). The number of color pixels in both primes was equated using a MATLAB code, to reduce low-level differences between the two primes. The display’s background was black and the gift box (which was 3D-shaped, with 10.914.3dimensions) appeared in the middle of the screen. A pre-test was conducted to ensure that the new display did not remind participants of the Pac-Man videogame. The non-semantic scrambled display was a scrambled version of the gift box prime, created in the same manner as in Experiment 1.

The prime words in Experiments 3 and 4 were the Hebrew word for Pac-Man (פקמן) and a non-word “Pal-Man”, created by switching one letter (ק) with another letter (ל), following. The displays’ background was black, the letters were white, and were written in David font. The words (10.914.3) appeared in the middle of the screen.

In Experiment 5, three English words were used as primes: ‘Triangle’ served as a congruent semantic prime, ‘Square’ as an incongruent semantic prime, and ‘Tsianmle’ as a non-word prime (made by switching the triangle letters (r, g) with the letters (s, m), to create a meaningless word). The displays were presented on a black background and the letters were white in David font. The words (10.914.3°) appeared in the middle of the screen. The Kanizsa display used in Experiment 1 was used here as the left-side triangle Kanizsa display. The same display flipped horizontally was used to create a second Kanizsa display, in which the Kanizsa triangle appeared on the right side.

### Measuring osteotomy wedge angle is more important than measuring wedge height in open wedge osteotomies around the knee in preoperative planning [^7d490d4d]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

Figure 2 
Medial open wedge proximal tibial osteotomy is planned following lower limb deformity analysis using the mediCAD® software. Per case, 27 osteotomy variants were planned utilizing three osteotomy entry points and nine hinge points (A–C). Osteotomy entry points as well as hinge points were determined in a standardized fashion in a coordinate system based on anatomic landmarks (a).

Twenty‐one variations of DFO, each combining a different hinge and entry point, were planned to adjust the WBL to align with 50.0% of the tibial plateau's width, measured from the medial edge of the plateau (Figure 3). Conversely, a standardized coordinate system was defined to determine hinge and entry points (Figure 3). Osteotomy B7 was considered the optimal hinge position.

Figure 3 
Lateral open wedge distal femur osteotomy is planned after initial lower limb deformity analysis using the mediCAD® software. Twenty‐one osteotomy variants were planned utilizing three osteotomy entry points and seven hinge points (A–C). Points were determined standardized on a coordinate system based on anatomic landmarks (a).

Of each planned osteotomy, the osteotomy depth and wedge height were measured manually. The widths of the tibia and femur were measured at their widest diameters, parallel to the tibial or femoral joint line. The correction angle, as well as the mechanical lateral distal femur angle (mLDFA), medial proximal tibia angle (MPTA), joint line convergence angle (JLCA) and mFA‐mTA, were calculated using the mediCAD® software.

Mathematical prediction of wedge height

The wedge height was calculated using a formula based on the correction angle and osteotomy depth. In opening osteotomies, the wedge forms an isosceles triangle comprising two congruent right‐angled triangles, with the hypotenuses representing the osteotomy depth and the alpha angle being half the opening angle. Wedge height, calculated using the sine function, is the sum of the opposite sides relative to the hinge point (Figure 4). Example calculations are in Table 1. The wedge height was both manually measured and mathematically calculated, and deviations were determined.

Figure 4 
The osteotomy wedge is an isosceles triangle consisting of two identical congruent right‐angled triangles. Using the sine function, the wedge height can be calculated as displayed.

Within spacing-different mixture arrangements, pores with additional shapes were realizable and further tuned by adjusting AV. For example, besides circular pores (green) in the basic arrangement, elliptical pores (cyan) were observed in the accessory arrangements (Fig. 4a, b). Smith et al. explained that the unique shape with higher structural asymmetry stems from the biaxial compressive stress competition between neighboring arrangements, as further evidenced by different anodization rates under nonuniform EF distribution therein (Supplementary Fig. 25). Likewise (see Supplementary Fig. 26), three-pointed star-shaped pores (blue, Fig. 4c) were realized in the centered tetragonal arrangement at 140-V AV. The accessory arrangements can be inserted in the form of line (Fig. 4d), area (Fig. 4e), and even complex patterns (Fig. 4f) as well, achieving other shapes such as isosceles triangular (yellow), rectangular (orange), and semi-circular (purple). Similarly, these new shapes are changeable by adjusting AV. For example, the pores owning the same spatial configuration (Supplementary Fig. 27) were varied from the non-bent (yellow, Fig. 4d) to the wall-externally-bent (yellow, Fig. 4f) triangular shape as increasing AV from 190 to 210 V. The successful mixing of spacing-different arrangements by appropriately choosing AVs will diversify the spatial configuration of AAO pores, thus giving rise to pores with designable shapes that are otherwise unobtainable in conventional spacing-identical configurations.

Parenteral nutrition (PN) label content and design—home and alternate site care: The label should include purpose for use of PN using clear, simple terms such as “for nutrition supplementation” or “to provide nutrition.” The labels should limit auxiliary information, with auxiliary information evidence based in simple, explicit language that is minimized to avoid distracting patients with nonessential information, presented in a standardized manner and critical for patient understanding and safe medication use, and using only icons for which adequate evidence suggests improved patient understanding about correct use of the medication. Labels should address limited English proficiency; whenever possible, the directions for use should be provided in the patient’s preferred language to help prevent medication errors, and whenever possible, the directions for use should also appear in English to facilitate counseling. Medication names shall be in English so that emergency personnel and other healthcare professionals can have quick access to the information, and translations of prescription labels should be produced using a high-quality translation process. Labels should be designed and formatted so that they improve readability and optimize typography using high-contrast print, simple uncondensed familiar fonts with space within letters and between letters, sentence case with initial capital followed by lowercase words, large font size for critical information, adequate white space between lines of text, white space to distinguish sections on the label such as directions for use vs pharmacy information, horizontal text only, never truncate or abbreviate critical information, highlighting, bolding, and other typographical cues that preserve readability and emphasize patient-centric information or information that facilitates adherence, limiting the number of colors used for highlighting, and addressing visual impairment.

### A surgical activity model of laparoscopic cholecystectomy for co-operation with collaborative robots [^8a90eda7]. Surgical Endoscopy (2024). Medium credibility.

Our dataset contains fewer videos than the one used in CholecTriplet2022 (20 vs. 45 videos) and addressing the lower amount of total data and infrequent classes by sampling videos at a higher framerate (3.125 vs. 1 FPS) did not appear to solve this issue. Thus, more videos and video segments should be annotated in the future. The auxiliary use of semantically segmented video frames, which contain rarely targeted but often visible tissues, may also improve performance. Recording videos with multi-modal medical device sensor data, e.g. the electrocautery signal feed, may also improve annotations. Semi-supervised ML approaches may bridge the gap between the availability of surgical video and lack of annotations thereof.

In the second experiment, the algorithm cross-validation mAP score using our own HeiCholeActivity dataset as well as CholecT45 as input improved over the score achieved by the algorithm using only CholecT45 as input (37.9% vs. 36.5%). This improvement is encouraging for further research on state-of-the-art algorithms which achieve 40.6% mAP using only CholecT45 for training. However, the difference in annotation rules between the datasets made the symbolical mapping of our own classes to the classes of CholecT45 partly inconsistent. For example, the target “Calot triangle” was mapped to “cystic_plate” in the CholecT45 dataset. The target “Calot triangle” was often used in our own dataset to annotate dissecting activities in the Calot triangle dissection phase and implicitly includes cystic duct, cystic artery and cystic plate. This is due to the consideration that differentiating the correct target in a causal manner while it was still covered by fatty tissue, and thus potentially false was too ambiguous and subjective for consistent goal-driven annotations. Therefore, “cystic duct” and “cystic artery” can only be annotated when clipped or cut according to our annotation rules. In CholecT45, “cystic duct” and “cystic artery” were also annotated in the Calot triangle dissection phase. This highlights the need for transparent annotation rules across datasets in literature which we address in the Supplementary Material.

In the third experiment, big differences in class performance between actors were noted. For example, the action “Grasp/Hold” was recognized well for the surgeon’s left hand and the target “Calot triangle” was recognized well for the surgeon’s right hand (Fig. 4).

### The essential anatomical subunit approximation unilateral cleft lip repair [^58998feb]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

The anatomical subunit approximation cleft lip repair advantageously achieves a balanced lip contour, with the line of repair hidden along seams of aesthetic subunits. Dr. David Fisher's original description of the repair reflects the considerable thought that went into the evolution of his design. As his technique has gained acceptance in the intervening 10 years, the authors note several key principles embodied in it that represent a shift in the cleft lip repair paradigm. The authors believe understanding these principles is important to mastery of the anatomical subunit technique, and facilitate its teaching. First, design a plan that adheres to anatomical subunits and perform measurements precisely. Second, identify and adequately release each cleft tissue layer from the lip and nose to enable restoration of balance. Third, drive surgical approximation through inset of the lateral muscle into the superiorly backcut medial orbicularis muscle, followed by skin closure with inferior triangle interposition above the white roll. In this article, the authors present essential components of the technique, and identify several principles that enable its successful execution.

### Enhanced detection of cortical atrophy in Alzheimer's disease using structural MRI with anatomically constrained longitudinal registration [^7a858411]. Human Brain Mapping (2021). Medium credibility.

2.4 Surface‐based registration

Ciftify (Dickie et al. 2019) was used to translate FreeSurfer output into a format consistent with the Human Connectome Project (HCP) pipeline (Glasser et al. 2013) and to accomplish registration to the MNI space. Surfaces from the native space, as defined in the HCP pipeline, were used as the starting point for longitudinal analysis with aMSM.

aMSM was used to align each subject's baseline and 2‐year cortical reconstructions (Robinson et al. 2014 ; Robinson et al. 2018). As shown in Figure 1, aMSM modifies an input surface, bringing it into alignment with a reference surface and producing an output surface that has point‐correspondence to the reference surface. Each surface can be represented as a series of vertices that connect to form triangular faces. aMSM evaluates these triangular faces to calculate cortical deformations that exist between the input and reference surfaces, while penalizing deformations incongruent with the mechanical properties of brain tissue (Garcia et al. 2018). Uniquely, aMSM penalizes these deformations on the anatomical surface (Figure 1), offering increased accuracy over alternatives relying on deformations of the spherical surface, which introduce additional artifact (Robinson et al. 2018). After registration, the deformations of each triangle provide detailed, local measures to map change in cortical surface area at the resolution of the control point grid (10,242 vertices in this study, corresponding to an average resolution of approximately 20 mm 2).

FIGURE 1 
Longitudinal registration with aMSM. Physical deformation of the cortical surface between two timepoints is calculated for each triplet of vertices on the input surface (red dots) and reference surface (blue dots). Similar to other popular surface registration techniques (Yeo et al. 2010) vertices from both the input surface and reference surface are projected to a spherical representation to simplify mathematical calculations. However, unlike other registration techniques, aMSM (gray box) regularizes vertex displacement to minimize physical deformation (strain energy based on mechanical properties of brain tissue) between the anatomical surfaces (2a, 2b). Based on these constraints, triplets on sphere 1 are shifted to bring them into alignment with triplets on sphere 2 (3). Once realigned, sphere 1 is projected to a new anatomical output surface (4), resulting in more realistic physical deformations of the cortical surface

### CIB2 and CIB3 are auxiliary subunits of the mechanotransduction channel of hair cells [^980be57c]. Neuron (2021). Medium credibility.

CIB2 is a Ca 2+ - and Mg 2+ -binding protein essential for mechanoelectrical transduction (MET) by cochlear hair cells, but not by vestibular hair cells that co-express CIB2 and CIB3. Here, we show that in cochlear hair cells, CIB3 can functionally substitute for CIB2. Using X-ray crystallography, we demonstrate that CIB2 and CIB3 are structurally similar to KChIP proteins, auxiliary subunits of voltage-gated K v 4 channels. CIB2 and CIB3 bind to TMC1/2 through a domain in TMC1/2 flanked by transmembrane domains 2 and 3. The co-crystal structure of the CIB-binding domain in TMC1 with CIB3 reveals that interactions are mediated through a conserved CIB hydrophobic groove, similar to KChIP1 binding of K v 4. Functional studies in mice show that CIB2 regulates TMC1/2 localization and function in hair cells, processes that are affected by deafness-causing CIB2 mutations. We conclude that CIB2 and CIB3 are MET channel auxiliary subunits with striking similarity to K v 4 channel auxiliary subunits.

### Solving olympiad geometry without human demonstrations [^34ba4bce]. Nature (2024). Excellent credibility.

AlphaGeometry discovers a more general theorem than the translated IMO 2004 P1.

Left, top to bottom, the IMO 2004 P1 stated in natural language, its translated statement and AlphaGeometry solution. Thanks to the traceback algorithm necessary to extract the minimal premises, AlphaGeometry identifies a premise unnecessary for the proof to work: O does not have to be the midpoint of BC for P, B, C to be collinear. Right, top, the original theorem diagram; bottom, the generalized theorem diagram, in which O is freed from its midpoint position and P still stays on line BC. Note that the original problem requires P to be between B and C, a condition where the generalized theorem and solution does not guarantee.

Human expert evaluation of AlphaGeometry outputs

Because AlphaGeometry outputs highly interpretable proofs, we used a simple template to automatically translate its solutions to natural language. To obtain an expert evaluation in 2000 and 2015, during which AlphaGeometry solves all geometry problems and potentially passes the medal threshold, we submit these solutions to the USA IMO team coach, who is experienced in grading mathematical olympiads and has authored books for olympiad geometry training. AlphaGeometry solutions are recommended to receive full scores, thus passing the medal threshold of 14/42 in the corresponding years. We note that IMO tests also evaluate humans under three other mathematical domains besides geometry and under human-centric constraints, such as no calculator use or 4.5-h time limits. We study time-constrained settings with 4.5-h and 1.5-h limits for AlphaGeometry in Methods and report the results in Extended Data Fig. 1.

Learning to predict the symbolic engine’s output improves the language model’s auxiliary construction

In principle, auxiliary construction strategies must depend on the details of the specific deduction engine they work with during proof search. We find that a language model without pretraining only solves 21 problems. This suggests that pretraining on pure deduction proofs generated by the symbolic engine DD + AR improves the success rate of auxiliary constructions. On the other hand, a language model without fine-tuning also degrades the performance but not as severely, with 23 problems solved compared with AlphaGeometry’s full setting at 25.

### Safe cholecystectomy multi-society practice guideline and state of the art consensus conference on prevention of bile duct injury during cholecystectomy [^42e7db52]. AAES (2020). High credibility.

Subtotal cholecystectomy—systematic review findings and laparoscopic versus open comparative outcomes are as follows: A systematic review identified 30 studies of 1,200 patients who underwent subtotal cholecystectomy, with the approach laparoscopic in 72.9%, open in 19.0%, and laparoscopic converted to open in 8.0%; indications were AC in 72%, cirrhosis/portal hypertension in 18.2%, gangrene or perforation in 6.1%, and Mirizzi syndrome in 3%. Reported complications included bile duct injury (BDI) in 0.08%, bile leak in 18.0%, subhepatic collections in 2.9%, retained stones in 3.1%, need for post-op ERCP in 4.1%, re-operation in 1.8%, and mortality 0.4%. Compared with open subtotal cholecystectomy, the laparoscopic approach was associated with less risk of sub-hepatic collection (OR 0.4, 95% CI 0.2-0.9), retained stones (OR 0.5, 95% CI 0.3-0.9), wound infection (OR 0.2, 95% CI 0.04-0.2), reoperation (OR 0.5 95% CI 0.3-0.9), and mortality (OR 0.2, 95% CI 0.05-0.9), but had more bile leaks (OR 5.3, 95% CI 3.9-7.2); bile leaks resolved spontaneously in 31.2%. There was no standardization of technique across studies and outcomes were not compared to total cholecystectomy; the panel deemed that a subtotal cholecystectomy is likely to limit the risk for BDI by avoiding dissection in the hepatocystic triangle.

### A system of anatomical triangles defining dissection routes to brainstem cavernous malformations: definitions and application to a cohort of 183 patients [^5315af58]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

Anatomical triangles defined by intersecting neurovascular structures delineate surgical routes to pathological targets and guide neurosurgeons during dissection steps. Collections or systems of anatomical triangles have been integrated into skull base surgery to help surgeons navigate complex regions such as the cavernous sinus. The authors present a system of triangles specifically intended for resection of brainstem cavernous malformations (BSCMs). This system of triangles is complementary to the authors' BSCM taxonomy that defines dissection routes to these lesions.

Methods

The anatomical triangle through which a BSCM was resected microsurgically was determined for the patients treated during a 23-year period who had both brain MRI and intraoperative photographs or videos available for review.

Results

Of 183 patients who met the inclusion criteria, 50 had midbrain lesions (27%), 102 had pontine lesions (56%), and 31 had medullary lesions (17%). The craniotomies used to resect these BSCMs included the extended retrosigmoid (66 [36.1%]), midline suboccipital (46 [25.1%]), far lateral (30 [16.4%]), pterional/orbitozygomatic (17 [9.3%]), torcular (8 [4.4%]), and lateral suboccipital (8 [4.4%]) approaches. The anatomical triangles through which the BSCMs were most frequently resected were the interlobular (37 [20.2%]), vallecular (32 [17.5%]), vagoaccessory (30 [16.4%]), supracerebellar-infratrochlear (16 [8.7%]), subtonsillar (14 [7.7%]), oculomotor-tentorial (11 [6.0%]), infragalenic (8 [4.4%]), and supracerebellar-supratrochlear (8 [4.4%]) triangles. New but infrequently used triangles included the vertebrobasilar junctional (1 [0.5%]), supratrigeminal (3 [1.6%]), and infratrigeminal (5 [2.7%]) triangles. Overall, 15 BSCM subtypes were exposed through 6 craniotomies, and the approach was redirected to the BSCM by one of the 14 triangles paired with the BSCM subtype.

Conclusions

A system of BSCM triangles, including 9 newly defined triangles, was introduced to guide dissection to these lesions. The use of an anatomical triangle better defines the pathway taken through the craniotomy to the lesion and refines the conceptualization of surgical approaches. The triangle concept and the BSCM triangle system increase the precision of dissection through subarachnoid corridors, enhance microsurgical execution, and potentially improve patient outcomes.

### An aperiodic chiral tiling by topological molecular self-assembly [^9b5ae99f]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Abstraction of molecular self-assembly into triangular offset-tiling.

a Color code for both enantiomers of t[4]HB and their relative azimuthal orientation. b Presentation of a self-assembled pattern of t[4]HB (P)- enantiomers as triangles. The color stands for the azimuthal orientation as defined in (a) while the number stands for the relative size N of the triangle. c Modes of interdigitation between triangles at their common boundary. The handedness of the majority enantiomer defines the direction of the interdigitation offset of triangles (see ellipses). An additional offset by one molecular unit vector is also observed for equally sized triangles (middle) and for N ±1 pairs (bottom). d Superposition of STM images of the different node types in both mirror domains with the abstraction of triangles. The node type is defined by the number of offsets as indicated by arrows. e Example of topological frustration. An area initially built by 2-nodes (N = 7±1) can only become completely filled if a 3-node is considered.

Three distinct categories of triangle interdigitation emerge. Equally sized triangles necessitate an inevitable offset contingent on the enantiomer’s handedness (Fig. 2c, top). Furthermore, equally sized triangles may exhibit an additional offset of one molecular unit vector (Fig. 2c, middle), leading to a total offset of 2-unit vectors at that boundary. Lastly, combining triangles of different sizes, N and N ± 1, consistently results in an offset of one molecular unit vector (Fig. 2c, bottom). This framework enables a total of 10 different triangular pairing configurations (see Supplementary Fig. 6). Nodes with a topological index of 0, 2, and 3 will, respectively, feature total offsets of 0, 2, and 3 (Fig. 2d). The topology established by these offsets translates into the spiral pattern when constructing nodes using N, N ± 1 triangles. Consequently, the handedness of supramolecular nodes emerges from a chiral displacement within the triangular context. It is important to note that deviations from these displacement rules have not been observed. Only 15 of many possible combinations of triangles within the N, N ± 1 scheme have been verified through STM observations (Supplementary Fig. 7). However, we could not identify any tiling rules that would forbid involvement of unobserved combinations.

### Backmapping triangulated surfaces to coarse-grained membrane models [^9495d041]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Fig. 2 
Three-dimensional triangulation of a triangle.

a One triangle is divided to four triangles by finding three new vertices in proximity of the mid-point of each of the edges of the original triangle. This increases the vertex number by a factor of 4. b Using the geometrical properties at two neighboring vertexes, an estimate of the geodesic connecting two neighboring vertices can be found (red curve). c By performing several consecutive operations as shown in a, enough points are generated on each triangle for lipid placement.

Step 3: CG protein placement : In this step, each CG protein structure is transferred to its given vertices using. This will guarantee a correct orientation of the proteins both along the normal and on the local plane. To avoid re-equilibration of lipid–protein interactions, instead of transferring only proteins, one can transfer a protein with its neighboring lipids (including lipids underneath for peripheral membrane proteins) from an equilibrated MD structure (Fig. 1).

Step 4: CG lipid placement : We first calculate the number of the required lipids to cover the surface of each monolayer. To do this, we first calculate the total area of the monolayer TS (is monolayer index) aswhereandare the number of proteins and projected area of the transmembrane region of the protein (protein projected area for peripheral membrane proteins). Then, we randomly select a vertex, check if it is in touch with any protein, if not, then place a lipid with a probability of. This step will be iterated untillipids are selected. Our results show a quick convergence of this algorithm (Fig. 1).

### Decoupled choice-driven and stimulus-related activity in parietal neurons may be misrepresented by choice probabilities [^95382d2d]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Fig. 5 
Partial correlation results for congruent and opposite cells. a Visual and vestibular heading partial correlations are presented for neurons classified as ‘congruent’ or ‘opposite’ based on whether the visual and vestibular partial correlations for heading had the same or opposite signs, respectively. Significantly congruent or opposite cells (p < 0.05 for both the visual and vestibular heading partial correlations) are marked by filled data points. Circle and triangle symbols mark the new and the old data sets, respectively. N values represent the number of cells (the number of significantly congruent or opposite cells in parentheses). Only cells which showed a significant main effect of heading or choice (p < 0.05, two-way ANOVA) for both visual and vestibular conditions were included. b Heading and choice partial correlations are presented for the same cells. Red and blue symbols represent the data for the visual and vestibular conditions, respectively. c Choice partial correlations measured during the visual and vestibular conditions are compared for the same cells. Solid lines and the shaded regions represent type-II regressions with their 95% confidence intervals. r and p -values for the regressions in panel b are presented on the respective plots. For all the regressions in black (a, c) p < 0.001 (except for the second plot in a, for which p = 0.02)

Interestingly, we find that congruent cells in MSTd show a positive relationship between heading and choice partial correlations for both the visual (red) and vestibular (blue) conditions (Fig. 5b, third column; p = 0.0004 and p = 4×10 −8, respectively; Pearson correlation between heading and choice partial correlations; N = 61). This indicates that choice-related signals in MSTd congruent cells are largely predictable from stimulus tuning. Critically, for opposite cells in MSTd, we find a significant negative relationship between heading and choice partial correlations in the visual condition (Fig. 5b, red plot, rightmost column; Pearson correlation p = 0.02, N = 33). Thus, results for the visual condition in MSTd are consistent with the idea that MSTd neurons may be decoded according to their vestibular heading preferences,.

### Hakuba's triangle: a cadaveric study detailing its anatomy and neurovascular contents with vascular and skull base implications [^417c7798]. Neurosurgical Review (2022). Medium credibility.

Hakuba's triangle is a superior cavernous sinus triangle that allows for wide and relatively safe exposure of vascular and neoplastic lesions. This study provides cadaveric measurements of the borders of Hakuba's triangle and describes its neurovascular contents in order to enrich the available literature. The anatomical borders of the Hakuba's triangle (lateral, medial, and posterior borders) were defined based on Hakuba's description and identified. Then the triangle was dissected to reveal its morphology and relationship with adjacent neurovascular structures in Embalmed Caucasian cadaveric specimens. The oculomotor nerve occupied roughly one-third of the area of the triangle and the nerve was more or less parallel to its medial border. The mean lengths of the lateral border, posterior border, and medial border were 17 mm±0.5 mm, 12.2 mm±0.4 mm, and 10.6 mm±0.4 mm, respectively. The mean area of Hakuba's triangle was 63.9 mm 2 ±4.4 mm 2 .

### Antiretroviral drugs for treatment and prevention of HIV in adults: 2024 recommendations of the international antiviral society-USA panel [^0b67ffda]. JAMA (2025). Excellent credibility.

Recommended PrEP regimen—selection and reassessment: Current PrEP agent options for a given individual based on population and risk behavior are provided in Box 6 and Table 4. The optimal PrEP regimen for a given person is the one that is most acceptable and congruent with their routes of potential HIV exposure; preference for modality of administration, including ability to take oral tablets reliably; ability to plan sexual or IDU activity; and adverse effect profile of the regimen. The initially chosen PrEP regimen, and whether ongoing PrEP is needed or of interest, should be reevaluated based on ongoing assessments of the same issues.

### Arrays of individually controlled ions suitable for two-dimensional quantum simulations [^178267d1]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

A precisely controlled quantum system may reveal a fundamental understanding of another, less accessible system of interest. A universal quantum computer is currently out of reach, but an analogue quantum simulator that makes relevant observables, interactions and states of a quantum model accessible could permit insight into complex dynamics. Several platforms have been suggested and proof-of-principle experiments have been conducted. Here, we operate two-dimensional arrays of three trapped ions in individually controlled harmonic wells forming equilateral triangles with side lengths 40 and 80μm. In our approach, which is scalable to arbitrary two-dimensional lattices, we demonstrate individual control of the electronic and motional degrees of freedom, preparation of a fiducial initial state with ion motion close to the ground state, as well as a tuning of couplings between ions within experimental sequences. Our work paves the way towards a quantum simulator of two-dimensional systems designed at will.

### Reconstruction of the nasal soft triangle subunit [^9018b67d]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Of all nine subunits, the soft triangle is perhaps the most challenging to recreate. The complexity of soft triangle reconstruction resides in its proximity to such important structures as the nasal tip, nasal ala, and distal columella. If the soft triangle is not properly reconstructed, problems with nasal function and aesthetics often arise. Anatomical asymmetries in the lower third and abnormal shadowing can occur following insufficient restoration.

Methods

A retrospective review was completed of all patients undergoing reconstruction of the nasal soft triangle subunit at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, Texas, from 1995 to 2010. Defects with only external skin intact were classified as type I. Defects involving both skin and underlying soft tissue with intact mucosa were classified as type II. Finally, transmural defects with violated mucosa were classified as type III. Surgical outcomes were graded on a scale of I to IV. Grades given were based on the complexity of the existing defect and restoration of the soft triangle, with higher grades given when adjacent structures were not distorted.

Results

Of the 14 cases reviewed, two (14 percent) were type I defects, nine (64 percent) were type II defects, and three (21 percent) were type III defects. Three patients (21 percent) required revision with subsequent resurfacing and two (14 percent) required resurfacing alone. All but one patient (93 percent) had a grade of 2.0 or better, with the one patient opting not to undergo revision.

Conclusions

The authors believe their method of soft triangle reconstruction using the proposed algorithm is an easy approach to soft triangle reconstruction that will yield consistent surgical and clinical success from aesthetic and functional perspectives. Furthermore, the authors were able to achieve excellent aesthetic outcomes without compromise or facing any structural complications.

### Ultrasound visualization of the spinal accessory nerve in vivo [^f60a4217]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Inadvertent injury of the spinal accessory nerve during surgical procedures is a cause of significant morbidity with medicolegal repercussions. Surface anatomy is an unreliable guide to the nerve's location. We suggest that ultrasound can be used to map the course of the nerve in the posterior triangle of the neck.

Materials and Methods

Fifty healthy subjects (28 females, mean age 37 y) were scanned using a VF13-5 linear probe and a Siemens Sonoline Antares ultrasound machine (Siemens Medical Solutions USA Inc., Malvern, PA). The caliber, course, and distribution of the nerve in the posterior triangle of the neck were recorded.

Results

The nerve was visualized bilaterally in all subjects, running superficially across the posterior triangle with either a straight (56%) or tortuous (44%) course at a depth of about 3 mm beneath the skin surface. It had a mean caliber of 0.76 ± 0.12 mm. It exited the posterior border of sternocleidomastoid at a mean of 6.7 (4.0-9.4) cm below the mastoid process and 1.1 (0.1-2.1) cm above the great auricular point and penetrated the anterior border of trapezius 5.4 (2.1-9.2) cm above the clavicle. Importantly, 58% of nerves divided into 2-4 branches before penetrating trapezius; the nerve branched on at least one side in 49 of 50 individuals.

Conclusions

The spinal accessory nerve and its anatomical variants can be consistently and reliably demonstrated by ultrasound in normal individuals. Surface anatomical landmarks are not a reliable guide to the position and course of the nerve in the posterior triangle. Preoperative mapping of the nerve with ultrasound may reduce the risk of iatrogenic injury.

### Mapping contributions of the anterior temporal semantic hub to the processing of abstract and concrete verbs [^ab4c622a]. Human Brain Mapping (2025). Medium credibility.

5.7 Imaging Acquisition

All imaging was performed on a 3.0 T Phillips Elition MRI scanner with a 32‐channel head coil and a SENSE factor of 2.5. We used a dual‐echo gradient‐echo EPI fMRI sequence to acquire 31 axial slices covering the whole brain in ascending sequential order with the following parameters: short echo time (TE) = 12 ms and long TE = 35 ms, repetition time (TR) = 2000 ms, and flip angle = 85°. The functional EPIs were acquired with an in‐plane reconstructed resolution of 2.5 × 2.5 mm and a slice thickness of 4 mm voxels (reconstruction matrix = 96 × 96; FOV (mm) = 240 × 240 × 124). We acquired five dummy scans prior to each run (to develop a steady state magnetisation), followed by 224 volumes per run. We acquired the four main functional runs with a single direction k‐space traversal in the left–right phase‐encoding direction. In addition, we acquired a short EPI “pre‐scan” with the participants at rest. The parameters of the pre‐scan matched the main functional scans with the exception that they included interleaved dual direction k‐space traversals. This provided us with 10 pairs of images with opposing direction distortions (10 left–right and 10 right–left) which were used in a k‐space distortion correction procedure for addressing geometric distortion and mislocalisation due to magnetic susceptibility artifacts. We acquired a high‐resolution T2‐weighted scan to assess the accuracy of our distortion correction procedure, which contained 36 slices covering the whole brain with the following parameters: TE = 78 ms, TR = 3410 ms; flip angle = 90°. The T2‐weighted scan was acquired with a reconstructed voxel size (mm) of 0.6 × 0.6 × 4 and a slice thickness of 4 mm voxels with a 1 mm slice gap (reconstruction matrix = 400 × 370; FOV (mm) = 240 × 240 × 179). In addition, we used a T1‐weighted imaging sequence to acquire an anatomical image used to estimate the transformation of our functional images into MNI space. The T1 images contained 175 slices covering the whole brain and were acquired with the following parameters: TE = 18 ms, TR = 3.5 ms; flip angle = 8°, reconstructed voxel size (mm) = 0.94 × 0.94 × 1 and reconstruction matrix = 240 × 240. All images were acquired with a 30° axial tilt.

### Guidelines for performing ultrasound-guided vascular cannulation: recommendations of the American Society of Echocardiography [^b9aacea9]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2025). High credibility.

Internal jugular vein cannulation—performance of the “blind” landmark technique is summarized as follows: The landmark technique identifies a triangle subtended by the two heads of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and the clavicle and is a safe technique in experienced hands. Reported performance includes a failure rate of 7.0% to 19.4%, due partly to the imprecise correlation between external landmarks and the vessel, and when initial landmark-guided attempts are unsuccessful, successful cannulation diminishes to <25% per subsequent attempt. Static ultrasound (US) imaging for skin marking can find variations in IJV anatomy and identify patients in whom the landmark technique is not likely to be successful.

### COCATS 4 task force 6: training in nuclear cardiology [^af7940e0]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2015). Medium credibility.

General standards for nuclear cardiology training note that the ACC, American Heart Association, and ASNC have addressed training requirements and guidelines for patient selection, imaging protocols, interpretation, correlation with coronary anatomy, follow-up, and prognosis, with congruent recommendations addressing faculty, facility requirements, emerging technologies, and clinical practice. The authors recommend strongly that candidates for the ABIM examination who seek competency in nuclear cardiology, and those seeking certification and Authorized User status for nuclear cardiology procedures, review Certification Board of Nuclear Cardiology and Nuclear Regulatory Commission requirements. Cardiovascular fellowship programs should satisfy facilities and faculty requirements, and eligibility for the CBNC examination requires that training occur in a cardiology, radiology, or nuclear medicine program accredited by the ACGME, with the intensity of training and required resources varying according to the level of training.

### Guidelines for performing ultrasound guided vascular cannulation: recommendations of the American Society of Echocardiography and the Society of Cardiovascular Anesthesiologists [^51839ce9]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2011). Medium credibility.

Internal jugular cannulation technique and ultrasound advantages—With landmark technique, a needle at the apex of the sternocleidomastoid triangle directed toward the ipsilateral nipple should encounter the IJ 1.0 to 1.5 cm beneath the skin, but failure rates are 7.0% to 19.4% and, if initial attempts fail, success diminishes to <25% per subsequent attempt. Ultrasound increased overall success from 96% to 100% with improved first attempt success (from 54% to 73%), fewer needle advances (from 2.8 to 1.4 attempts), shorter cannulation time (from 117 to 61 sec), and lower arterial punctures (from 8.43% to 1.39%). Ultrasound also identifies anatomic variations observed in up to 36% of patients, including small fixed IJs in 3% of patients, and a small vein predicts difficulty because an ultrasound view diameter < 7 mm (cross-sectional area < 0.4 cm2) is associated with decreased cannulation success.

### Original design of the limberg flap: an opposite triangular flap [^f2939072]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

The aim of this study was to identify the original design of the Limberg flap.Publications by the original author, Limberg, and his original designs of the so-called "Limberg flap" were searched in PubMed. These included his original monograph written in Russian (Mathematical Principles of Local Plastic Procedures on the Surface of the Human Body, 1946), the first English paper ("Design of Local Flaps," 1966), and English translation of his book by Wolfe (1984).Three figures that may be the prototypes of the Limberg flap were found in the 1946 Russian monograph. One figure involved designing unilaterally active opposite triangular flaps, placed on a lateral incision on the edge of the defect. Another was closure of a defect of the nasal dorsum with a cheek flap with opposite triangular flaps with lateral incision angles of 30° and 105°. The third depicted closure of the lateral section of a fusiform defect using adjacent opposite triangular patches. In 1966 English chapter, he described the rotation of a triangular flap for the closure of a rhomboid defect. Two standing cones and a lying cone are still formed and should be sited where the tissues are lax enough to compensate. In 1984 English translation, the "unilaterally active opposite triangular flaps" and "rotation of a triangular flap in the closure of a rhomboid defect," were translated as "convergent triangular flaps" and "convergent triangular flaps" respectively.Limberg first called original design of the flap "opposite triangular flap," and later "local triangular flap" for closing rhomboid skin defects.

### ACR-ASNR-ASSR-SIR-SNIS practice parameter for the performance of image-guided epidural steroid injection [^aa3be57e]. SIR (2025). High credibility.

Infraneural/retrodiskal TFESI using Kambin's triangle—arterial considerations and complication rates: The infraneural/retrodiskal approach is an alternative TFESI trajectory using Kambin's triangle, defined as a right triangle over the dorsolateral disc, and its advantage includes decreased risk of intravascular penetration. By spinal angiography, the radiculomedullary artery is located in the superior half of the intervertebral foramen in 97% of cases and is never seen in the inferior one-fifth, and the safest needle placement for a TFESI, particularly at L3 and above, may be in an inferior and slightly posterior position within the foramen relative to the nerve. Despite arterial avoidance, this approach still carries 6.6% risk of vascular injections, with other risks including inadvertent intradiscal penetration (4.7%) and subarachnoid or subdural extra-arachnoid injection (3.1%). Needle design findings are mixed, with some authors finding comparable risk between blunt-tip and pencil-point needles while others found that blunt needles had decreased incidence of vascular penetration and paresthesias.

### Ultra-high dynamic range quantum measurement retaining its sensitivity [^6f9c90ae]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

To improve the sensitivity for a large range, initially, a number of measurements with different areas are combined to uniquely define the magnetic field amplitude in a range limited by the measurement with the smallest area (Fig. 1d). Consequently, only part of the measurement time is spent on the largest area, which has the best sensitivity (but a small range), while the remainder of the time is spent on areas with a worse sensitivity. Therefore, the sensitivity of the combined measurement is strictly worse than this best sensitivity. Using halved areas (hence requiring at leastadditional areas) and the same number of iterations for each area and using no optimisations, for roughly the same σ B, the measurement time for the combined sequence. Thus, the sensitivity would becometimes worse, which is already a significant improvement compared to the straightforward case in the last paragraph.

The measurements resulting from different areas are combined via Bayes’ theorem. For area A n, the measurement gives signal S n (for example the crosses/circles/triangles on the sinusoids in Fig. 1a, d for three areas). The posterior probability distribution for the magnetic field B given measured signal S n iswiththe prior distribution,independent of B, andwiththe relation between the signal S and the applied field B (the sinusoids in Fig. 1a, d, e). Fig. 1e visualises these equations.is a Poisson distribution (counting photons), but it can be approximated by a normal distribution (green line along y -axis in Fig. 1e) when more than ~10 photons arrive (with continuity correction). This is generally the case when the uncertainty is below the maximum uncertainty, as described later. For the first measurement, the prior distribution is flat since there is no initial knowledge about the field, and for the remainder of the measurements, the previous posterior is the new prior distribution. This results in a combined distribution as demonstrated in Fig. 1f.

### Aesthetic subunits of the breast [^b9e27c5d]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

Surgery for breast cancer has traditionally addressed the breast as if it were a geometric circle with associated quadrants. Cosmetic reconstruction should not follow geometric patterns but should emphasize perceived contour and normal clothing lines. Similar to nasal reconstruction, a subunit principle in breast reconstruction planning may significantly improve the appearance of the result. To better identify the most aesthetic subunits for breast reconstruction, 10 years of autogenous reconstruction in 264 patients was reviewed. Various patterns of breast subunits were identified. The more favorable subunits of the breast in terms of postoperative appearance and camouflage of scars included the nipple, areola, and expanded areola subunits. For larger skin defects, the best subunits were the inferolateral, lower half, and a total breast subunits. Dividing the breast into reconstructive subunits that are to be replaced as a whole rather than as a patch gives superior results. Photographed examples of aesthetic subunits illustrate the placement of scars along natural lines that maximize the advantages of camouflage afforded by clothing.

### Ultra-high dynamic range quantum measurement retaining its sensitivity [^63f3f730]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Algorithm design

To design our eventual algorithm, its principle is explored in more detail with additional simulations. Fig. 3a shows the result for changing the relative number of iterations for each area, which reveals that there is a trade-off between the lowest uncertainty reached for measurement times at the steep region and at long measurement times. In other words, depending on T meas, a different relative number of iterations gives the lowest uncertainty. When fixing these (Figs. 2a and 3a), the uncertainty is not optimised, and thus it can display very steep curves that can be tuned to even sub-Heisenberg-like scaling (for examplein Fig. 3a).

Fig. 3 
Simulation analyses.

a For different relative numbers of iterations of the subsequences (written directly left of each curve) of areas A, the uncertainty σ B with respect to measurement time T meas changes. Depending on the measurement time, a different combination gives the lowest uncertainty. b Minimised uncertainty for a large-range sequence by optimally combining the subsequences (red line). The dashed lines give the uncertainty for single-area sequences (A 0 blue, A 0 /2 magenta, A 0 /4 olive, A 0 /8 grey). See Supplementary Note 1 for maximum uncertainty ∝ range. c The relative number of iterations for each area (A 0 blue crosses, A 0 /2 magenta circles, A 0 /4 olive triangles, A 0 /8 grey diamonds kept at 10 0) for each measurement time to minimise the uncertainty, which results in the red line in b. The vertical arrows indicate when a subsequence for its area turns on, since its relative number of iterations becomes significant. The green dashed line gives the relative difference between the most-sensitive small-range sequence (blue dashed line in b) compared to the optimally combined large-range sequence. This difference scales inversely with the measurement time. d When looking at the turning-on points (yellow crosses, fit with black dotted line) for many sequences with different areas (largest area blue line, smallest area red line), it scales asfor short measurement times. Please note that the optimally combined result in b scales as, since it includes relatively large areas only, equivalent to the lowest lines in this plot.

### Imaging the structure of the trimer systems (4) He3 and (3) He (4) He2 [^1f6f9de3]. Nature Communications (2014). Medium credibility.

Helium shows fascinating quantum phenomena unseen in any other element. In its liquid phase, it is the only known superfluid. The smallest aggregates of helium, the dimer (He2) and the trimer (He3) are, in their predicted structure, unique natural quantum objects. While one might intuitively expect the structure of (4)He3 to be an equilateral triangle, a manifold of predictions on its shape have yielded an ongoing dispute for more than 20 years. These predictions range from (4)He3 being mainly linear to being mainly an equilateral triangle. Here we show experimental images of the wave functions of (4)He3 and (3)He(4)He2 obtained by Coulomb explosion imaging of mass-selected clusters. We propose that (4)He3 is a structureless random cloud and that (3)He(4)He2 exists as a quantum halo state.

### Congruency between publicly available pictorial displays of medial temporal lobe atrophy [^ecf175f6]. European Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Measurements

The height of the hippocampal formation (defined as the dentate gyrus, hippocampus proper, and subiculum together with parahippocampal gyrus) was measured in each image according to the original description by Scheltens, as well as the height of the hippocampus by itself. This was accomplished by measuring the respective largest vertical heights of both the hippocampal formation and the hippocampus. In addition, areas of the HC, TH, and PHG were manually delineated. All measurements were made using free-hand tools in the open-access image analysis program ImageJ.

In the area measurement of the HPC, all but the most distal part, the “tail,” was included in the area. The PHG was delineated using the corner of the collateral sulcus as a lateral end point where a line was drawn straight across the gyrus. The TH was defined as limited by the choroid fissure. The choroid plexus located inside the TH was sometimes visible and used as a marker to confirm the TH space. See Fig. 1 for a representative image.

Fig. 1 
The method for normalized measurements. A reference line was drawn from the midline to the most lateral border of the temporal lobe (Y). The height of the hippocampus (X 1) and the hippocampal formation (X 2) was divided by the reference line to get normalized heights for each image. Areas delineating the temporal horn, hippocampus, and parahippocampal gyrus (X 3,4,5) were normalized by dividing their respective areas by the squared length of the reference line

Since full information about image size and dimensions was not available, it was necessary to normalize the measurements. First, a straight vertical line was drawn through the midline, using the falx cerebri, septum pellucidum, and the center of the pons as landmarks. A line parallel to this was drawn tangentially to the most lateral part of the temporal lobe. Finally, a horizontal line perpendicular to the two prior lines was drawn to measure the distance between them, which was set as a reference line (Fig. 1).

### Correction of asymmetric pectus excavatum using a virtually designed silicone implant [^b9cc9b9c]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Background

An extended asymmetric funnel chest deformity with the breast gland located in the thoracic mold can lead to a fictitious aplasia of the breast. The authors termed this condition "pseudo-Amazon syndrome" because the breast tissue and the pectoralis muscle are fully developed.

Methods

This report presents a detailed technical approach to the fabrication of a precise-fitting custom-made silicone implant. The design of the implant was achieved using a computed tomography (CT) data set and rapid prototyping. The volumes of the "hidden" and the normal breasts measured preoperatively by processing the CT data were similar. These volumes were compared with the breast volumes measured by three-dimensional photography 4 years postoperatively to assess the predictability of the volume congruency. The silicone implant was surgically placed in the epicostal plane and extended almost over the right hemithorax.

Results

The implantation was performed without the necessity of further trimming. Both the surgeon and the patient rated the aesthetic and functional long-term result as good in terms of symmetry and the possibility of exercise without restrictions. The final breast volume of the surgically treated side was 95 % of the volume of the normal contralateral breast.

Conclusion

The described method reduces the operation time and the operative trauma by primary implant fit. However, the method is rather elaborate and the production process is expensive. This in turn reduces the generation of proceeds to a minimum.

### Aromatic thiol-mediated cleavage of N-O bonds enables chemical ubiquitylation of folded proteins [^0e84d677]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

Towards the semisynthesis of suH2B, we first generated full-length histone H2B bearing a protected ligation auxiliary as the entry point for testing our methodology. To ensure that the auxiliary protecting group could be removed under native conditions, we synthesized a photoprotected form (3) by starting from 2-nitrobenzyl chloride and N -(2-bromoethoxy)phthalimide (Fig. 5a and Supplementary Figs 28–30). The auxiliary 3 was incorporated at Lys120 of the H2B(117–125) C-terminal peptide with an Ala to Cys mutation at position 117 (Fig. 5b). After acidolytic cleavage from the solid phase, the peptide 4 was ligated via its N-terminal Cys to an H2B(1–116)-α-thioester to generate full-length H2B(A117C), 5 (Fig. 6a,b and Supplementary Figs 31–33). The product 5 was folded by dialysis into 50 mM Na 2 HPO 4, pH 7.5 (Fig. 6c), and every subsequent step was performed under folded conditions. First, complete deprotection of the auxiliary thiol was achieved by irradiation with 365 nm light for 3.5 h in the presence of ascorbic acid, semicarbazide and dithiothreitol. The integrity and folded state of the deprotected protein were confirmed by ESI-MS and circular dichroism (Fig. 6d,e). The deprotected H2B(A117C) aux, 6, was then ligated under non-denaturing conditions to the SUMO-3(2–91)C47S-α-thioester over 48 h to yield the ligation product H2B(A117C) Su(C47S)aux, 7 (Fig. 6f–h and Supplementary Fig. 34). The sumoylated product 7 was subjected to MPAA-mediated auxiliary removal for 24 h, yielding the ligation product lacking the ligation auxiliary, H2B(A117C) Su(C47S), 8, in 15–30% yield over two steps (Fig. 6i). Importantly, we observed no precipitation of the H2B species throughout these manipulations, and the folded state of the reduced ligation product 8 was confirmed by size exclusion chromatography and circular dichroism (Supplementary Fig. 35). As a functional test of the correct folded state of SUMO-3 in 8, we undertook its desumoylation with the SUMO-specific protease sentrin specific peptidase 1 (SENP1). Congruent with our observations that MPAA-mediated N–O bond cleavage did not lead to the denaturation or aggregation of 8, we observed efficient hydrolysis by SENP1 and the appearance of lower molecular weight species corresponding to the hydrolysed SUMO-3 and H2B(A117C) (Supplementary Fig. 36).

### Surgical anatomy of the aortic annulus: landmarks for external annuloplasty in aortic valve repair [^681af087]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Although reduction of a dilated aortic annulus is becoming an essential parameter for durable valve repair, anatomical descriptions of the annulus and surgical landmarks of the subvalvular plane for an external aortic annuloplasty remain to be defined.

Methods

Twenty hearts with normal anatomy with tricuspid aortic valves were studied. Annulus diameter, cusp geometric height, and interleaflet triangles heights were measured. The aortic root was dissected externally down to the subvalvular plane as to perform an external aortic annuloplasty or reimplantation procedure proximal anastomosis. Tissue thickness and dissection heights relative to the annulus were measured at each cusp nadir and at the middle of each interleaflet triangle.

Results

The mean annulus diameter, cusp geometric height, and interleaflet triangle heights were, respectively, 24.9 ± 0.2 mm, 19.7 ± 0.3 mm, and 20.1 ± 0.5 mm. External dissection of the aortic root reached the subvalvular plane below the nadir of left coronary cusp (-2.7 ± 0.4 mm), noncoronary (NC) cusp (-3.1 ± 0.3 mm), and the base of left-NC interleaflet triangle (-2.1 ± 0.4 mm). External dissection remained above the nadir of the right coronary cusp (+1.4 ± 0.4 mm), base of left-right interleaflet triangle (+2.4 ± 0.6 mm), and right-NC interleaflet triangle (+3.4 ± 0.3 mm). Mean tissue thickness between the inner and external side of the subvalvular plane was 2.5 ± 0.1 mm.

Conclusions

External dissection of the aortic annulus allows subvalvular placement of an external aortic ring below the left and NC cusps and below or within 3 mm of the right cusp nadir in 80% of cases. An external aortic annuloplasty would induce at least a 5-mm reduction of annulus diameter, corresponding to tissue thickness. Precise anatomical landmarks are important to standardize aortic valve annuloplasty.

### AAnet resolves a continuum of spatially localized cell States to unveil intratumoral heterogeneity [^ffe93fa7]. Cancer Discovery (2025). Medium credibility.

Archetypal Loss

In addition to the reconstruction loss, we want to enforce the latent space of the autoencoder learns the structure of the data with respect to the ATs. To this end, we convert the coordinates from Cartesian to barycentric after the encoder learns the transformation. The barycentric coordinate system, related to Cartesian coordinates, is a system in which each point is specified by reference to a simplex. When coordinates are normalized to sum to 1, the vertices of the simplex are denoted by k one-hot vectors of length k for a-simplex. For example, a triangle is a two-simplex with three vertices, wherein the three vertices are (1,0,0), (0,1,0), and (0,0,1). All coefficients of point P are positive if and only if P is inside the simplex.

As this coordinate system describes points with respect to a simplex, it is well suited to be the latent space for learning archetypes.

To enable interpretation of points as convex combinations of ATs, we enforce each point to stay within the simplex by adding an archetypal loss term, the mean squared error of the negative coefficients:

Extrema Loss

We developed a novel method to identifyplausible ATs prior to model training. This method, explained in detail below, builds a graph from the data and then uses the eigenvectors of the Laplacian matrix to find extreme points in the datasets; these points will be referred to as diffusion extrema. We then include an extrema loss term that penalizes large distances in the latent space between the diffusion extrema and the vertices of the simplex. If the diffusion extrema and standard basis vectors in the latent spaceare labeled asand, respectively, then this loss term can be calculated as

Letbe the points in the dataset. Then, the procedure for finding these diffusion extrema is as follows:
1. Construct a graphfrom the dataset. This can be done by computing a symmetrized-nearest neighbors graph from the dataset and then weighting the edges with a Gaussian kernel, as was done by Moon and colleagues.
2. Letdenote the eigenvectors of the combinatorial Laplacianofwith corresponding eigenvalues. Compute

### ACR-ASNR-ASSR-SIR-SNIS practice parameter for the performance of image-guided epidural steroid injection [^5e1da642]. SIR (2025). High credibility.

Transforaminal epidural steroid injection (TFESI)—infraneural/retrodicsal approach is described as using Kambin’s triangle and the advantage of this approach is the decreased risk of intravascular penetration. By spinal angiography, the radiculomedullary artery is located in the superior half of the intervertebral foramen in 97% of cases and is never seen in the inferior one-fifth of the intervertebral foramen, and the authors concluded that the safest needle placement for a TFESI, particularly at L3 and above, may be in an inferior and slightly posterior position within the foramen and relative to the nerve. Although there is decreased risk of injuring a radiculomedullary artery, this approach still carries 6.6% risk of vascular injections, and other risks of infraneural/retrodicsal TFESI include inadvertent intradiscal penetration (4.7%) and subarachnoid or subdural extra-arachnoid injection (3.1%).

WARNING: RISKS FROM CONCOMITANT USE WITH OPIOIDS; ABUSE, MISUSE, AND ADDICTION; and DEPENDENCE AND WITHDRAWAL REACTIONS

Concomitant use of benzodiazepines and opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required. Follow patients for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Drug Interactions (7.1)] .
The use of benzodiazepines, including triazolam, exposes users to risks of abuse, misuse, and addiction, which can lead to overdose or death. Abuse and misuse of benzodiazepines commonly involve concomitant use of other medications, alcohol, and/or illicit substances, which is associated with an increased frequency of serious adverse outcomes. Before prescribing triazolam and throughout treatment, assess each patient's risk for abuse, misuse, and addiction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].
The continued use of benzodiazepines, including triazolam, may lead to clinically significant physical dependence. The risks of dependence and withdrawal increase with longer treatment duration and higher daily dose. Abrupt discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction of triazolam after continued use may precipitate acute withdrawal reactions, which can be life-threatening. To reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions, use a gradual taper to discontinue triazolam or reduce the dosage [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] .

Evidence cited includes Li et al., a meta-analysis of 4 RCTs and 3 retrospective observational studies of mini-PCNL comparing suction versus traditional sheaths that reported significantly less operative time and fewer auxiliary procedures with suction, a 39% lower likelihood of requiring additional stone-removing procedures, and significantly higher stone-free rates; Chen et al. found no difference in stone-free or sepsis rates between suction or standard sheaths but less blood loss, fewer postoperative complications, shorter operative time, and lower incidence of fever with suction. Given heterogeneity and potential outcome bias, this statement was assigned a Conditional Recommendation, and the Panel recognized that not all surgeons have ready access to suction sheaths in their facility.

### An anatomical study of the transversus abdominis plane block: location of the lumbar triangle of petit and adjacent nerves [^e1c48dbd]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2009). Low credibility.

Background

The transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block is a new technique for providing analgesia to the anterior abdominal wall. Most previous studies have used the lumbar triangle of Petit as a landmark for the block. In this cadaveric study, we determined the exact position and size of the lumbar triangle of Petit and identified the nerves affected by the TAP block.

Methods

The position of the lumbar triangle of Petit was assessed unilaterally in 26 cadaveric specimens relative to reliably palpable surface landmarks. In addition, a series of dissections were performed to explore the course of the nerves blocked by the TAP.

Results

The mean distance from the midaxillary line along the iliac crest to the center of the base of the lumbar triangle of Petit at the level of the subcutaneous tissue and over the skin surface was 6.9 cm (range, 4.5-9.2 cm) and 9.3 cm (range, 4-15.1 cm), respectively. The center of the lumbar triangle of Petit was 1.4 cm above the iliac crest. The depth of the TAP at the lumbar triangle of Petit position was 0.5-4 cm and at the midaxillary line it was 0.5-2 cm. The average size of the lumbar triangle of Petit was 2.3 cm x 3.3 cm x 2.2 cm, with an average area of 3.63 +/- 1.93 cm2. The three cadaveric specimens we explored showed the nerves blocked by TAP passed lateral to the triangle. An incidental finding was that in 66% of specimens the lumbar triangle of Petit contained small branches of the subcostal artery.

Conclusions

The lumbar triangles of Petit found in the specimens in this study were more posterior than the literature suggests. The position of the lumbar triangle of Petit varies largely and the size is relatively small. The relevant nerves to be blocked had not entered the TAP in the specimens in this study at the point of the lumbar triangle of Petit. At the midaxillary line, however, all the nerves were in the TAP.

### Degenerate boundaries for multiple-alternative decisions [^55f4a482]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Sequential Bayesian inference can be rewritten in a form that more closely resembles a sum of evidence by taking the logarithm of equation (8):For each of the n -choices, the accumulated evidence is the log posterior,, with n distinct evidence incrementsand a common subtractive log-marginal term. Calculation of this log-marginal is necessary for multiple (n > 3) choice optimal decision-making, but can be avoided for n = 2 by using the SPRT as mentioned above. A similarterm in a theory of basal ganglia function has been interpreted as suppressing evidence accumulation when choices are ambiguous –.

Within this framework, using that probabilities sum to unity ∑ i P i (t) = 1, the evidence accumulation takes place within an (n − 1)-dimensional linear subspace spanning n vertices { P i = 1, P j ≠ i = 0} of an N -dimensional unit hypercube. This is most easily seen for N = 3 choices, where the decision variables P = (P 1, P 2, P 3) vary within a triangle passing through three vertices {(1, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0), (0, 0, 1)} of the unit cube (Fig. 1, top right panel). So rather than representing evidence accumulation trajectories as a random walk constrained to two dimensions, for multiple alternatives the random walk moves in higher dimensions (a line for two alternatives, a plane/triangle for three, and so on). For simplicity, this vector is initialized with equal prior probabilities 1/ n and updated sequentially until one of the elements reaches a boundary, P i > θ.

Both the SPRT and two-choice sequential Bayesian inference give optimal decisions in that they give the fastest decisions for a given level of accuracy on single trials of known difficulty. Formally, they optimize a cost function, the Bayes risk, that is linear in the mean error rate e and mean decision time T over many trialswith error costs W i > 0 and cost of time c, scaling the expected error and decision time,and. This cost function represents the trade-off between speed and accuracy of decision-making: slow but accurate or fast but inaccurate decisions are both costly, and so a balance must be found. For equal decision costs, W 0 = W 1, there is a single threshold that is free parameter, which for optimal decision-making is tuned according to the relative cost c / W of accuracy and time.

### The 30-degree angle revisited [^eec48357]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

The standard surgical ellipse, with 30 degrees apical angles and a length-to-width ratio of 2 or 3 to 1, works optimally on a flat surface. The same pattern, when used for excisions on strongly convex or concave surfaces, leads to distortions which may require significant revisions. The reason for these discrepancies is explainable by the mathematical differences between flat Euclidian geometry and curved non-Euclidian geometry. Understanding these basic mathematical principles as applied to cutaneous surgery should lead to better preoperative planning, fewer intraoperative surprises, and more pleasing results.

### Automatic data-driven design and 3D printing of custom ocular prostheses [^6f718f3e]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Correspondence generation

We compute corresponding landmarks on the mesh surface via depth maps (Supplementary Algorithm 2), using the fact that the maximum number of intersections between an aligned prosthesis shape’ surface and any line parallel to the z-axis is two. The depth maps are given by the orthogonal projection of the surface along the z-Axis for front and back view (Supplementary Fig. 1f, j). To determine the corresponding points, we perform ray marching to compute lines radially from the origin to the edge of the prosthesis projection, for 48 directions at incremental angles of 7.5°. On these lines we distribute points at distinct fractions (shown in Supplementary Fig. 1g, k), points placed at the same fraction form a ring. We skip the placement at certain fractions for lines at distinct angles to achieve a more homogeneous density, and for the front we select the factions such that the limbus is always marked by the third ring. The result is a point cloudwith 838 corresponding vertices (189 vertices on the front and 649 on the back of the prosthesis shape); together with a set of 1672 triangle facesit defines the shape’s mesh representation(Supplementary Fig. 1h, l), withbeing the space of the prosthesis shape vertices and faces.

Shape model generation

A selection of 173 manually produced prostheses sourced from a stock at MEH were scanned, marked, aligned, and the corresponding landmarks computed as described above. The size of the axis-aligned bounding box (width, height, and depth) of the shapes ranges from (18.5 × 15.9 × 9.7) mm 3 to (28.6 × 32.3 × 22.2) mm 3 with a mean of (24.2 × 22.5 × 15.5) mm 3. We did not perform Generalized Procrustes Analysisfor two reasons. First because the correct rotation is already given and the size is normalized implicitly by the limbus size that was very similar for these shapes. Secondly and more importantly the size of the prosthesis is related to the shape, meaning that some shapes are more likely for certain eye socket volume sizes.

### Normal gaze patterns of the face in lateral view [^8c1ed437]. Facial Plastic Surgery & Aesthetic Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Importance: Current efforts to quantify the attentional distraction of facial deformities have been limited to deformities that are best perceived when the face is in frontal view, and there remains a paucity of knowledge of societal perception of the face in lateral view. To date, no attempts have been made to characterize the fixation patterns of the face in lateral view. Objective: To characterize the fixation patterns and gaze patterns of the face in lateral view. Design, Setting, and Participants: This was a prospective randomized controlled trial at an academic tertiary medical center. Eighty participants (mean age 23.6±1.7 years, 52.5% female) gazed freely at 11 images of faces in lateral view for 10s each as an infrared eye-tracker recorded eye movements in real time. Main Outcomes and Measures: Recorded eye movements are superimposed on the images to visualize areas of interest (AOIs) that attract the most attention. Fixation duration targeted at each AOI is transformed into relative fixation of the entire face and neck. Hotelling's test of variance followed by post hoc t -testing assessed for the significance of fixation differences between the mouth and cheeks. Results: Participants spent an average of 6.0 (95% CI 5.8-6.2) s gazing at the face and neck areas of each image. Of this attention, 2.8s or 49.8% (45.4-54.2%) was directed toward the eye, followed distantly by the nose (mean, 95% CI) (16.4%, 14.5-18.3%), cheek (12.0%, 11.4-14.5%), neck (4.6%, 3.8-5.4%), and mouth (4.0%, 3.4-4.6%). These differences were found to be significant by Hotelling's analysis and post hoc testing. A student's t -test also indicated observers directed significantly more attention within the eye-nose-cheek triangle [4.6s or 79.5% (75.6-83.5)] compared with the eye-nose-mouth triangle [4.1s or 71.2% (66.9-75.5)] ( p <0.001). Conclusions and Relevance: When perceiving novel faces in lateral view, casual observers preferentially directed attention toward the eye, nose, and cheek. These findings suggest that we draw from a slightly different collection of features to build a schema of the sagittal face, which may serve to complement the central triangle and build upon a three-dimensional model of the "normal" human face. Level of Evidence: NA.

We further explored the adsorption kinetics of ReO 4 − in the TFPM-PZ-Cl structure using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations (Fig. 6a). After placing the structure of TFPM-PZ-Cl into a bulk ReO 4 − aqueous solution, a lot of ReO 4 − diffused in the aqueous solution was adsorbed very quickly into the internal structure of TFPM-PZ-Cl along with many Cl − being desorbed from the structure (Fig. 6b). To objectively demonstrate this kinetic process, the adsorption rate of ReO 4 − from the environment (Fig. 6c, blue curve) and the retention rate of pristine Cl - (Fig. 6c, red curve) were analyzed. The kinetic curves showed that a very obvious intersects appeared at ca. 7 ns. After 7 ns, the number of ReO 4 − anions adsorbed by TFPM-PZ-Cl exceeded the number of Cl − anions remaining in TFPM-PZ-Cl. After about 35 ns, the ReO 4 − adsorption rate almost unchanged and stabilized at ca. 75.7%. Meanwhile, the retention rate of Cl − was ca. 13.8%. To reveal the driving forces of the adsorption process, the time evolution of the non-bonded interaction energies of COF-ReO 4 −, COF-Cl −, and ReO 4 − -Cl − were computed, and they were further assigned to the electrostatic and van der Waals (vdW) interactions (Fig. 6d). In the time of the adsorption process of ReO 4 − (<35 ns), the non-bonded interaction energy between ReO 4 − anion and COF was reduced from 0 to −3600 kJ mol −1 (i.e. more favorable) (Fig. 6d, solid red square). Among them, the change of electrostatic part was about −2500 kJ mol −1 (Fig. 6d, open red triangle), which was about 2.3 times larger than that of the vdW part (−1100 kJ mol −1) (open red inverted triangle in Fig. 6d). Meanwhile, the nonbonding interaction between Cl − and COF increased from −3800 to −300 kJ mol −1 (less favorable) (Fig. 6d, solid blue square), in which the electrostatic moiety contributed ~3200 kJ mol −1 (open blue triangles in Fig. 6d), and the vdW fraction contributed ~300 kJ mol −1 (open blue inverted triangles in Fig. 6d). Meanwhile, the non-bonded interaction energy between the Cl - and ReO 4 − anions increased by ~62 kJ mol −1 (less favorable) (Fig. 6d, solid pink square) with the electrostatic part increased by 66 kJ mol −1 (repulsive) (Fig. 6d, hollow pink triangle), whereas the vdW part decreased by ~4 kJ mol −1 (attractive) (Fig. 6d, hollow pink inverted triangle). These results indicated that this ReO 4 − anions uptake process was strongly driven by the strong direct nonbonding interactions (especially electrostatic interactions) between ReO 4 − anions and TFPM-PZ-Cl. In addition, the direct electrostatic repulsion between ReO 4 − anions and Cl − anions further promotes the adsorption of ReO 4 − anions.

### SAGES clinical spotlight review: intraoperative cholangiography [^aff9df2f]. Surgical Endoscopy (2017). Medium credibility.

Near-infrared fluorescent cholangiography—using indocyanine green (ICG)—involves preoperative intravenous injection and protein-bound ICG emits light with a peak wavelength of 830 nm when illuminated with near-infrared light. Before dissection of Calot’s triangle, reported visualization rates range from 71.4-100% for the cystic duct, 33.3-100% for the common hepatic duct, 25-100% for the cystic duct/common hepatic duct junction, and 50-100% for the common bile duct. In one study, fluorescent imaging visualized targets in 69.6 % to 95.1% of patients and was a 2-3 fold increase compared to no dissection at all. Acute inflammation and tissue thickness (>5-10mm) over the triangle and porta hepatis were limiting factors, while BMI was found to not be a statistically significant variable. When intraoperative cholangiography (IOC) was not successful, fluorescent imaging was successful in 80% of cases for identifying the extrahepatic biliary anatomy. There are no data on its use in the pediatric population, and reported robotic cholecystectomy case series ranged from 44-184 cases.

Charts of all patients with HH seen over 15 years were reviewed. Only patients with incomplete HH documented on formal visual field testing and neuroimaging were included. HH was said to be congruent when the fields of both eyes were identical in shape, depth, and size. Patients were divided into two groups based on congruency of HH; demographic, clinical, and radiological characteristics were compared.

Results

Five hundred and thirty patients with 548 incomplete HH were included (373 congruent HH and 175 incongruent HH). Demographic variables were similar in both groups. Stroke caused 75% of congruent HH and 55.8% of incongruent HH; trauma and tumors caused 20.5% of congruent HH and 34.5% of incongruent HH (P < .001). The lesion locations in congruent HH vs incongruent HH included occipital lobe in 47.9% vs 21.3%, occipital lobe and optic radiations in 8.3% vs 5.6%, optic radiations in 32.4% vs 50.6%, optic tract in 7.2% vs 16.3%, and other locations in 4.2% vs 6.3% (P < .0001). Although there was a trend toward more congruent HH for lesions of the posterior visual pathways (P < .001), 50% of optic tract lesions and 59% of optic radiation lesions produced congruent HH.

Conclusion

Although lesions involving the occipital lobe characteristically produce congruent HH, at least 50% of lesions in other locations also produce congruent HH, especially if these lesions are stroke-related. The rule of congruency should be used cautiously and may not apply to optic tract lesions.

### Proposal of landmarks for clamping neurovascular elements during endoscopic surgery of the supraglottic region [^e0b8d737]. Head & Neck (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Bleeding within the supraglottic region can be a lethal complication after CO(2) laser microsurgery. Our aim was to propose endoluminal anatomical landmarks to locate the superior laryngeal vessels resulting in a safer microsurgery.

Methods

Endoluminal dissections were made in 22 larynges without laryngeal disease.

Results

The neurovascular structures were in the superior third of a triangle defined by the vocal process, the anterior commissure, and the epiglottic attachment of the aryepiglottic fold. They overlapped in 4 different ways: pattern I (70.4%): superior laryngeal vein (SLV), superior laryngeal artery (SLA), and internal laryngeal nerve (ILN); pattern II (13.6%): SLA, SLV, ILN; pattern III (4.6%): SLV, ILN, and SLA; pattern IV (4.6%): SLA, ILN, and SLV.

Conclusion

Microsurgery in the supraglottic region may be safer if surgeons are aware of the superior third of the above-defined triangle, "danger area", where the vascular elements of this region are located.

### First-trimester assessment of the nasal bones using the retronasal triangle view: a 3-dimensional sonographic study [^48d63d9e]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to evaluate a new sonographic technique for identifying the nasal bones using the retronasal triangle view, ie, the coronal plane at which the palate and frontal processes of the maxilla are simultaneously visualized.

Methods

Three-dimensional (3D) volumes were acquired from women undergoing first-trimester sonographic screening for aneuploidy by 2 accredited operators. Those data sets in which the fetal face was clearly identified were selected for offline analysis by 2 other observers who were unaware of the sonographic or clinical findings. The nasal bones were classified as both present, only 1 present (right or left), or absent according to the presence or absence of 2 small paired echogenic linear structures at the upper tip of the retronasal triangle as determined by 3D navigation in the coronal plane and compared to those findings obtained by 3D navigation in the sagittal plane. Additional 3D data sets involving a subset of 4 first-trimester fetuses with trisomy 21 and absent nasal bones were also analyzed retrospectively and included randomly in the study group.

Results

A total of 110 3D data sets were analyzed, of which 86% were obtained transabdominally and 14% transvaginally. The quality of nasal bone identification was classified subjectively by the observers as good in 67% of cases, fair in 29%, and poor in 4%. The nasal bones were classified as at least 1 present in 106 of the cases (96%) and absent in 4 (4%), with complete agreement between observers in both the sagittal and coronal planes (κ = 1). Discrimination between the right and left nasal bones was possible in 89% and 93% for observer A and in 96% and 96% for observer B by assessing the sagittal and coronal views, respectively (right nasal bone: κ = 0.90 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.79-1]; left nasal bone: κ = 0.85 [95% CI, 0.60-0.99]). The nasal bones were not identified at the level of the retronasal triangle view in any of the fetuses with trisomy 21 and absent nasal bones.

Conclusions

This study shows that the nasal bones can be confidently identified as paired echogenic structures located at the upper tip of the retronasal triangle. This coronal view of the fetal face offers the possibility of screening for the presence or absence of the nasal bones in the first trimester, especially when the standard midsagittal views of the fetal face are suboptimal because of fetal or maternal factors. Because both nasal bones can be evaluated simultaneously in the coronal plane, the retronasal triangle view may be advantageous over the conventional midsagittal view assessment, in which only 1 of the 2 nasal bones is evaluated.

Gastroparesis—parallel randomized controlled trial comparing gastric per-oral endoscopic myotomy (GPOEM) with botulinum toxin reports Gastroparesis Cardinal Symptom Index (GCSI) outcomes at 3 and 12 months. GPOEM involved submucosal injection of blue saline into the posterolateral antrum 5cm upstream from the pylorus, mucosal incision with a Dual or Triangle knife with application of Endocut current, submucosal dissection to the pyloric arch, retrograde myotomy of the pyloric muscle and the antrum within 2 cm, and closure with endoclips; the endoscopist performed more than 100 cases of POEM. Botulinum toxin was administered as 200 IU injected into four quadrants of the pylorus using a 23-gauge injection needle. For the Postprandial fullness and early satiety GCSI subscale, n at 3 months was 20 vs 17 and at 12 months 18 vs 14; mean change at 3 months was 3.9 (SD 0.7) to 2.4 (SD 1.4) vs 3.6 (SD 1.3) to 2.2 (SD 1.5), and at 12 months 3.9 (SD 0.7) to 2.7 (SD 1.5) vs 3.6 (SD 1.3) to 2.7 (SD 1.4). For the Postprandial fullness GCSI symptom, n at 3 months was 20 vs 17 and at 12 months 18 vs 14; mean change at 3 months was 4.4 (SD 0.8) to 2.8 (SD 1.7) vs 4.2 (SD 1.2) to 2.7 (SD 1.8), and at 12 months 4.4 (SD 0.8) to 3 (SD 1.8) vs 4.2 (SD 1.2) to 3.1 (SD 1.7). For the Early satiety GCSI symptom, n at 3 months was 20 vs 17 and at 12 months 18 vs 14; mean change at 3 months was 4.2 (SD 1.2) to 2.2 (SD 1.5) vs 3.7 (SD 1.2) to 2.4 (SD 1.8), and at 12 months 4.2 (SD 1.2) to 2.8 (SD 1.9) vs 3.7 (SD 1.2) to 3 (SD 1.7). Serious adverse events and Hospitalizations are listed.

### Cortical depth profiles in primary visual cortex for illusory and imaginary experiences [^f8d808d7]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

At the beginning of each trial of the imagery strength task (Supplementary Fig. 1A), a grey letter ‘R’ or ‘G’ (1.3 cm in size, i.e. 1.2° visual angle) appeared in the central lower part of the screen, at a distance of 4.9 cm (4.7°) from the fixation cross. The letter cued the participants as to which of the two colours they should imagine in the given trial—‘R’ for red, ‘G’ for green. The cue was shown for 1 s, and was followed by a 1 s break, during which only the fixation cross was visible. Following this phase, a faint grey circle (radius of 3.65 cm; 3.5°) was presented for 7 s, centred on the fixation cross. During these 7 s, participants were asked to imagine the colour as vividly as possible and within the frames of the faint grey circle on the screen. Following this 7-s imagery phase, the circle disappeared, and the word ‘vividness?’ appeared in the central lower part of the screen (at a distance of 4.9 cm/4.7° from the fixation cross), instructing participants to rate how vivid their mental image of the colour had been (scale ranging from 1 to 4 where 1 represented the lowest and 4 the highest level of vividness). After responding with a key press, the binocular rivalry display appeared for 0.75 s, showing circular Gaussian-windowed green and red colour stimuli, one shown to each eye. When the binocular rivalry display disappeared, participants were instructed to indicate via a key press which of the two colours had been dominant (‘1’ for red, ‘2’ green, ‘3’ for mixed). 10% of the trials were catch trials, where a mixture of both colours was presented to each eye; in these trials, participants should give a ‘mixed’ response; the failure to do so is an indicator of decision bias. Each participant completed one run with n = 100 trials, with one break after completing half of the trials. Individual imagery strength was defined as the individual bias with which the imagined stimulus gained perceptual dominance during subsequent binocular rivalry: imagery strength (%primed) = n primed /(n – n mock – n mixed), with n primed being the number of (non-catch) trials in which the imagined colour matched the colour that was subsequently dominant during binocular rivalry, n the total number of trials, n mock the number of catch trials, and n mixed the number of (non-catch) trials in which participants reported a mixed percept. An arbitrary, a priori-defined threshold of 60% priming was set as a threshold to identify individuals with good enough imagery ability (Supplementary Fig. 1B). Individuals that scored priming values at or above the threshold level were invited to participate in the fMRI study. The subjective vividness ratings that participants gave were not used as a criterion for participation in the fMRI sessions but were used in further analyses to check the validity of the pre-test (Supplementary Fig. 1C, D).

### Randomized trial of traditional dissection with electrocautery versus ultrasonic fundus-first dissection in patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy [^67a241d0]. The British Journal of Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Background

In laparoscopic cholecystectomy dissection can be with monopolar electrocautery or with ultrasonic shears, and can start at the triangle of Calot or at the fundus of the gallbladder.

Methods

Thirty-seven patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy were randomized to electrocautery dissection from the triangle of Calot and 43 to fundus-first dissection with ultrasonic shears. All procedures were strictly standardized, and patients and their postoperative carers were blinded to the operation performed.

Results

Ultrasonic fundus-first dissection was associated with a shorter duration of operation (mean 46 versus 61 min), fewer overnight hospital stays (two versus eight), lower pain scores 4 and 24 h after surgery, less nausea at 2, 4 and 24 h, and a shorter period of sick leave (mean 5.5 versus 9.3 days) compared with electrocautery from the triangle of Calot.

Conclusion

Ultrasonic fundus-first dissection during laparoscopic cholecystectomy was quicker and associated with less nausea and pain than electrocautery dissection from the triangle of Calot.

### Stressor-evoked brain activity, cardiovascular reactivity, and subclinical atherosclerosis in midlife adults [^33472c46]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

fMRI Stressor Task Battery

The tasks of this battery include a Stroop task and a multisource interference task (MSIT), each 9 minutes 20 seconds. Both entail processing conflictual information, receiving negative feedback, and making time‐pressured responses to unpredictable and uncontrollable stimuli that elicit subjective distress.Briefly, subjects complete 4, 52‐ to 60‐second blocks of trials in both tasks that define a congruent condition, which are interleaved with 4, 52‐ to 60‐second blocks of trials defining an incongruent condition. Conditions are preceded by a 10‐ to 17‐second fixation period. In the Stroop, subjects identify the color of target words in the center of a screen by selecting 1 of 4 identifier words. Selections are made by pressing 1 of 4 buttons on a glove, with each button matching an identifier word on the screen (eg, thumb button 1=identifier word on the left). During congruent Stroop trials: (1) targets are in colors congruent with the target words, and (2) identifiers are in the same colors as targets. During incongruent Stroop trials: (1) targets are in colors incongruent with the targets, and (2) identifiers are in colors incongruent with the colors that the identifiers name. In the MSIT, subjects in the NOAH study selected a number that differed from 4 others by pressing 1 of 4 buttons on the glove, with each button matching a number on the screen (thumb button 1=number 1). During congruent MSIT trials, targets were in a position compatible with their position on the glove. During incongruent MSIT trials, targets were in a position incompatible with their glove position. In the PIP study, subjects were presented with 3‐number stimuli and not 4 as in NOAH. One methodological difference is that although the PIP study used 0s in the MSIT to indicate an incompatible position in the congruent condition (eg, 1 0 0), NOAH used 1 number between 1 and 4 (eg, 1 2 2 2) during this condition. In incongruent conditions of both tasks in both cohorts, accuracy was held to ≈50% by adjusting intertrial intervals. Thus, consecutive accurate performance in an incongruent condition prompted shorter intertrial intervals. Conversely, less accurate performance lengthened intertrial intervals. To control for motor response differences between conditions, the number of trials in the congruent condition was yoked to the number completed in the incongruent condition. To implement yoking, (1) an incongruent block is administered first, and (2) congruent condition trials appear at the mean intertrial interval of the preceding incongruent block.

Figure 1 The Effects of Treatment with Simvastatin on Major Vascular Events and Major Coronary Events in HPS

N = number of patients in each subgroup. The inverted triangles are point estimates of the relative risk, with their 95% confidence intervals represented as a line. The area of a triangle is proportional to the number of patients with MVE or MCE in the subgroup relative to the number with MVE or MCE, respectively, in the entire study population. The vertical solid line represents a relative risk of one. The vertical dashed line represents the point estimate of relative risk in the entire study population.

Angiographic Studies

In the Multicenter Anti-Atheroma Study, the effect of simvastatin on atherosclerosis was assessed by quantitative coronary angiography in hypercholesterolemic patients with CHD. In this randomized, double-blind, controlled study, patients were treated with simvastatin 20 mg/day or placebo. Angiograms were evaluated at baseline, two and four years. The co-primary study endpoints were mean change per-patient in minimum and mean lumen diameters, indicating focal and diffuse disease, respectively. Simvastatin significantly slowed the progression of lesions as measured in the Year 4 angiogram by both parameters, as well as by change in percent diameter stenosis. In addition, simvastatin significantly decreased the proportion of patients with new lesions and with new total occlusions.

### Breaking of the site-bond percolation universality in networks [^e424f6aa]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

The stochastic addition of either vertices or connections in a network leads to the observation of the percolation transition, a structural change with the appearance of a connected component encompassing a finite fraction of the system. Percolation has always been regarded as a substrate-dependent but model-independent process, in the sense that the critical exponents of the transition are determined by the geometry of the system, but they are identical for the bond and site percolation models. Here, we report a violation of such assumption. We provide analytical and numerical evidence of a difference in the values of the critical exponents between the bond and site percolation models in networks with null percolation thresholds, such as scale-free graphs with diverging second moment of the degree distribution. We discuss possible implications of our results in real networks, and provide additional insights on the anomalous nature of the percolation transition with null threshold.

### Overestimation of numerical distances in the left side of space [^fe092e52]. Neurology (2004). Low credibility.

Normal subjects presented with a middle number and two left- and right-sided outer numbers overestimate the numerical distance between the middle number and that positioned at its left side. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) of the right posterior parietal cortex specifically counteracts this bias, suggesting that the mental representation of space defined by numbers is shifted toward the left side depending on a greater activity of the right hemisphere.

### The development of audiovisual speech perception in mandarin-speaking children: evidence from the mcGurk paradigm [^d1fdbc99]. Child Development (2023). Medium credibility.

The developmental trajectory of audiovisual speech perception in Mandarin-speaking children remains understudied. This cross-sectional study in Mandarin-speaking 3- to 4-year-old, 5- to 6-year-old, 7- to 8-year-old children, and adults from Xiamen, China (n=87, 44 males) investigated this issue using the McGurk paradigm with three levels of auditory noise. For the identification of congruent stimuli, 3- to 4-year-olds underperformed older groups whose performances were comparable. For the perception of the incongruent stimuli, a developmental shift was observed as 3- to 4-year-olds made significantly more audio-dominant but fewer audiovisual-integrated responses to incongruent stimuli than older groups. With increasing auditory noise, the difference between children and adults widened in identifying congruent stimuli but narrowed in perceiving incongruent ones. The findings regarding noise effects agree with the statistically optimal hypothesis.

### Relationships between retinal break locations and the shapes of the detachments [^885b2323]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

Modified categorization of detachment shapes in this study

Details of the modified categorization of retinal detachment shapes based on Lincoff’s rule are shown below. All our cases were classified into eight groups as follows: Group 1: detachments that occurred in the temporal or nasal superior region and did not exceed the 12 o’clock midline with the original break within 1 1/2 clock hours of the highest border of the detachment (in Figures 1 and 2, the black regions show the corresponding patterns of breaks in this category and the gray regions show the shapes of the detachments with our original drawing according to Lincoff’s schema from the original report); Group 2: shallow detachments that occurred in the inferior region with the original break corresponding to the more spread side of the 6 o’clock midline (Figure 3); and Group 3: detachments intersecting the 12 o’clock superior vertical midline shown in the schema from the original report (Figure 4). In Group 3, Lincoff mentioned that the original break should be within a triangle whose apex is at 12 o’clock and should intersect the equators shown in the schema for detachments beyond 12 o’clock from the original text in Group 3(A) (Figure 4); in addition, he restated that the original holes could be within 1 1/2 hours of 12 o’clock in Group 3(B) (Figure 5) in the same text. Accordingly, we examined this category using both criteria. Moreover, in the original report from 1971, there were five other classifications. Along with these classifications, other cases were classified into five more groups as follows: Group 4: symmetrical detachment occurring from the original break at 6 o’clock (Figure 6); Group 5: inferior bullous detachment with the original break in the superior region (Figure 7); Group 6: detachments across both the superior vertical and horizontal midlines with the original break on the side of the 12 o’clock meridian with the lower detachment (Figure 8); Group 7: almost total detachment except for a superior wedge-shaped attachment with the original break in the periphery near the highest border (Figure 9); and Group 8: total detachment at or near 12 o’clock, particularly within 1 1/2 hours of 12 o’clock (Figure 10).

Elsewhere, Lincoff avoided detachments “within a quadrant” that were too small for his law. In addition, macular hole detachments were rarely discussed.

Aortic stenosis—resolution of apparent discrepancies (Table 4) delineates two branches: for “AS velocity >4 m/s and AVA >1.0 cm2,” it directs to check LVOT diameter and LVOT velocity signal, calculate indexed AVA when height is <135 cm, BSA <1.5 m2, or BMI <22, evaluate AR severity, and evaluate for high cardiac output by LVOT stroke volume and 2D LV EF and stroke volume, with likely causes listed as high output state, moderate–severe AR, or large body size; for “AS velocity <4 m/s and AVA ≤1.0 cm2,” it directs similar measurement checks, then to evaluate for low transaortic flow volume including MR severity and mitral stenosis, and when EF ≤55% to assess valve calcification and consider dobutamine stress echocardiography, with likely causes listed as low cardiac output, small body size, or severe MR. Corroborating text states that with accurate measurements and no reversible high output state, “an AS velocity of >4 m/s and a valve area of ≥1.0 cm2” most likely reflects combined moderate AS/AR or large body size and that “AS velocity is a better predictor of clinical outcome … and should be used to define valve disease as ‘severe’,” whereas with no low output state, “an aortic velocity of <4.0 m/s and a valve area of <1.0 cm2” most likely indicates only moderate AS with a small body size.

2.2 Recommended Dosage

The recommended cumulative dosage of MAVENCLAD is 3.5 mg per kg body weight administered orally and divided into 2 yearly treatment courses (1.75 mg per kg per treatment course) (see Table 1). Each treatment course is divided into 2 treatment cycles:

Administration of First Treatment Course

First Course/First Cycle: start any time.
First Course/Second Cycle: administer 23 to 27 days after the last dose of First Course/First Cycle.

Administration of Second Treatment Course

Second Course/First Cycle: administer at least 43 weeks after the last dose of First Course/Second Cycle.
Second Course/Second Cycle: administer 23 to 27 days after the last dose of Second Course/First Cycle.

Administer the cycle dosage as 1 or 2 tablets once daily over 4 or 5 consecutive days [see How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16.1)]. Do not administer more than 2 tablets daily.

Following the administration of 2 treatment courses, do not administer additional MAVENCLAD treatment during the next 2 years. Treatment during these 2 years may further increase the risk of malignancy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] . The safety and efficacy of reinitiating MAVENCLAD more than 2 years after completing 2 treatment courses has not been studied.

2.3 Missed Dose

If a dose is missed, patients should not take double or extra doses.

If a dose is not taken on the scheduled day, then the patient must take the missed dose on the following day and extend the number of days in that treatment cycle. If two consecutive doses are missed, the treatment cycle is extended by 2 days.

2.4 Administration

MAVENCLAD tablets are taken orally, with water, and swallowed whole without chewing. MAVENCLAD can be taken with or without food.

Separate administration of MAVENCLAD and any other oral drugs by at least 3 hours during the 4 to 5 day MAVENCLAD treatment cycles [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.6)].

MAVENCLAD is a cytotoxic drug. Follow applicable special handling and disposal procedures [see References (15)]. MAVENCLAD is an uncoated tablet and must be swallowed immediately once removed from the blister. If a tablet is left on a surface, or if a broken or fragmented tablet is released from the blister, the area must be thoroughly washed with water.

The patient's hands must be dry when handling the tablets and washed thoroughly afterwards. Avoid prolonged contact with skin.

### Contralateral interoptic approach to paraclinoid aneurysms: a patient-selection algorithm based on anatomical investigation and clinical validation [^be89a73a]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

Aneurysms that arise on the medial surface of the paraclinoid segment of the internal carotid artery (ICA) are surgically challenging. The contralateral interoptic trajectory, which uses the space between the optic nerves, can partially expose the medial surface of the paraclinoid ICA. In this study, the authors quantitatively measure the area of the medial ICA accessible through the interoptic triangle and propose a potential patient-selection algorithm that is based on preoperative measurements on angiographic imaging.

Methods

The contralateral interoptic trajectory was studied on 10 sides of 5 cadaveric heads, through which the medial paraclinoid ICA was identified. The falciform ligament medial to the contralateral optic canal was incised, the contralateral optic nerve was gently elevated, and the medial surface of the paraclinoid ICA was inspected via different viewing angles to obtain maximal exposure. The accessible area on the carotid artery was outlined. The distance from the distal dural ring (DDR) to the proximal and distal borders of this accessible area was measured. The superior and inferior borders were measured using the clockface method relative to a vertical line on the coronal plane. To validate these parameters, preoperative measurements and intraoperative findings were reviewed in 8 clinical cases.

Results

In the sagittal plane, the mean (SD) distances from the DDR to the proximal and distal ends of the accessible area on the paraclinoid ICA were 2.5 (1.52) mm and 8.4 (2.32) mm, respectively. In the coronal plane, the mean (SD) angles of the superior and inferior ends of the accessible area relative to a vertical line were 21.7° (14.84°) and 130.9° (12.75°), respectively. Six (75%) of 8 clinical cases were consistent with the proposed patient-selection algorithm.

Conclusions

The contralateral interoptic approach is a feasible route to access aneurysms that arise from the medial paraclinoid ICA. An aneurysm can be safely clipped via the contralateral interoptic trajectory if 1) both proximal and distal borders of the aneurysm neck are 2.5-8.4 mm distal to the DDR, and 2) at least one border of the aneurysm neck on the coronal clockface is 21.7°-130.9° medial to the vertical line.

In the validation set of 94 patients, Quartile 1 showed a 13.3% (2/15) probability, whereas Quartiles 2–4 showed 47.6% (10/21), 55.2% (16/29) and 65.5% (19/29), respectively; sensitivity and specificity at the same cut-off were 0.75 and 0.51, and the likelihood ratio in Quartile #1 was 0.15.
