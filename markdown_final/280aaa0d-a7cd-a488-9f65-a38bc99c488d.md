## Question

A 62-year-old man presents to the emergency department after a brief loss of consciousness while standing in line at the grocery store. He reports feeling lightheaded before collapsing and regaining consciousness within a minute. He denies any chest pain, palpitations, tongue biting, or incontinence. His past medical history includes hypertension and hyperlipidemia. On examination, his vital signs are stable, and his neurological exam is completely normal. There is no evidence of head trauma. The emergency physician considers ordering a head CT scan and carotid Doppler ultrasound as part of the syncope workup.

Based on current AHA guidelines, should head CT/MRI or carotid artery imaging be performed in this patient as part of the routine evaluation for syncope? Justify your answer.

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether head CT/MRI or carotid artery imaging should be performed in a 62-year-old man with a classic vasovagal syncope presentation and a normal neurological exam, and how to justify that decision using current guidelines and evidence. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical diagnosis and whether this fits uncomplicated syncope. Then, I should verify what major guidelines (ACC/AHA/HRS, ESC, AAFP) say about routine neuroimaging and carotid ultrasound in syncope without focal deficits. Next, I will review the diagnostic yield and cost implications of these tests. After that, I need to consider exceptions where imaging is appropriate. Finally, I will synthesize a recommendation and outline the evidence-based workup this patient should receive instead of low-yield imaging.

> Let me first confirm the clinical picture. The story of prodromal lightheadedness, brief loss of consciousness with rapid recovery, no chest pain or palpitations, no tongue biting or incontinence, and a completely normal neurological examination is classic for vasovagal (reflex-mediated) syncope, which is benign and does not suggest a cerebrovascular cause; importantly, there are no focal neurological findings or head injury to prompt neuroimaging, and no carotid territory symptoms to suggest carotid disease as the mechanism of syncope [^7396cc1d] [^e37e526e].

> Wait, let me verify the guideline stance on head CT/MRI in this scenario. The 2017 ACC/AHA/HRS syncope guideline explicitly recommends against routine head CT or MRI in the evaluation of syncope in the absence of focal neurological findings or head injury, assigning a Class III (no benefit) recommendation with Level B-NR evidence; the ESC 2018 guideline similarly advises against routine brain MRI/CT in syncope without neurologic signs, and the AAFP 2023 guideline concurs that neuroimaging should not be obtained in the absence of neurologic signs or symptoms, so routine head imaging here would be inappropriate [^7ae89dcc] [^59d8cff9] [^a01fbe61] [^38e2a843].

> I should double-check the yield data to ensure I'm not missing a hidden benefit. Multiple analyses show extremely low diagnostic yield for head CT/MRI in uncomplicated syncope: pooled yields around 1–3.8% in ED cohorts, with many positive findings unrelated to the cause of syncope; in patients without high-risk neurologic features, neuroimaging yield can be 0% in some series, reinforcing that routine imaging rarely changes management in this population [^a54b5bb8] [^c59966e4] [^5f97646d].

> Next, I should review carotid ultrasound guidance. The ACC/AHA/HRS guideline states carotid artery imaging is not recommended in the routine evaluation of syncope without focal neurological findings, and the ESC guideline likewise advises against neck ultrasound in syncope; the AAN Choosing Wisely recommendation notes that carotid disease causes focal neurologic symptoms, not isolated syncope, so imaging in simple syncope increases cost without benefit and may uncover incidental stenosis that is not causally related [^9d028be1] [^a01fbe61] [^e887c4d5].

> Hold on, I should verify the yield and utilization data for carotid ultrasound in syncope. Observational and implementation studies show carotid ultrasound is frequently ordered for syncope (roughly 9–16% in some cohorts), yet the diagnostic yield for explaining syncope is near zero, and management rarely changes; this represents low-value care with substantial aggregate costs, estimated in the tens of millions annually for Medicare alone, without improving outcomes [^c8e987da] [^fd0b233a] [^063371d2].

> But wait, what if there are exceptions I'm overlooking? I need to ensure I consider appropriate indications for neuroimaging or carotid studies: focal neurologic deficits, concern for seizure, head trauma with red flags, severe headache suggesting subarachnoid hemorrhage, or suspected TIA/stroke would justify brain imaging and/or carotid imaging; likewise, in suspected TIA or stroke, noninvasive cervical carotid imaging is recommended to identify candidates for revascularization, which is a different clinical question than uncomplicated syncope [^7ae89dcc] [^57e6d9da] [^f4a5ec3b].

> Let me reconsider the pathophysiology to avoid a common pitfall. Syncope results from transient global cerebral hypoperfusion, whereas carotid stenosis causes focal ischemic symptoms (amaurosis fugax, hemispheric TIA, etc.); isolated syncope without focal signs is not a manifestation of carotid disease, so attributing syncope to carotid stenosis without focal symptoms is a mechanistic mismatch and a frequent source of unnecessary testing [^e37e526e] [^e887c4d5].

> I should confirm the evidence-based workup this patient should receive instead. The foundation is a careful history, physical exam including orthostatic vitals, and a 12-lead ECG; further testing is guided by initial findings, with echocardiography when structural heart disease is suspected, ambulatory ECG monitoring when arrhythmia is suspected, and tilt testing or carotid sinus massage when reflex syncope is suspected; this targeted approach maximizes diagnostic yield and avoids low-value imaging [^719db223] [^e29ba22b] [^38e2a843].

> In summary, I need to ensure my recommendation is clear and aligned with guidelines. No, head CT/MRI and carotid ultrasound should not be performed as part of the routine evaluation for this patient with uncomplicated vasovagal syncope and a normal neurologic exam; these tests are low yield, add cost, and do not clarify the cause of syncope in this presentation, whereas a focused history, exam, and ECG with risk stratification provide the highest value and are guideline-endorsed [^7ae89dcc] [^a01fbe61] [^38e2a843].

Routine head CT/MRI and carotid imaging are **not indicated** for this patient with uncomplicated syncope, a normal neurologic exam, and no head trauma [^7ae89dcc] [^a01fbe61]. Current AHA/ACC/HRS and ESC guidelines recommend against routine neuroimaging or carotid ultrasound in syncope without focal neurologic deficits or head injury, as these tests have **low diagnostic yield** and do not change management [^7ae89dcc] [^a01fbe61] [^a54b5bb8]. Reserve neuroimaging for patients with focal deficits, head trauma, or concern for stroke/TIA, and use carotid imaging only when there are focal neurologic findings or a bruit suggesting cerebrovascular disease [^7ae89dcc] [^9f94eed3]. Focus on history, exam, ECG, and risk stratification to guide further testing [^7396cc1d].

## Current guideline recommendations

### Head CT/MRI

- **ACC/AHA/HRS 2017 guidelines**: Do not obtain head MRI/CT in the routine evaluation of syncope without focal neurological findings or head injury requiring further evaluation [^7ae89dcc] [^59d8cff9].
- **ESC 2018 guidelines**: Do not obtain brain MRI/CT in patients with syncope without neurological signs or symptoms [^a01fbe61].
- **AAFP 2023 guidelines**: Do not obtain neurologic imaging, including carotid ultrasound and head CT/MRI, in the absence of neurologic signs or symptoms [^38e2a843].

---

### Carotid artery imaging

- **ACC/AHA/HRS 2017 guidelines**: Do not obtain carotid artery imaging in the routine evaluation of syncope without focal neurological findings on examination [^9f94eed3] [^59771a7f].
- **ESC 2018 guidelines**: Do not obtain neck ultrasound or brain MRI/CT in patients with syncope [^a01fbe61].
- **AAN 2013 Choosing Wisely**: Don't perform carotid imaging for simple syncope without other neurologic symptoms; syncope is not a symptom of carotid stenosis [^e887c4d5].

---

## Diagnostic yield and clinical utility

### Head CT/MRI

Head CT/MRI has a **low diagnostic yield** in uncomplicated syncope. A systematic review found that MRI established a diagnosis in only 0.24% of cases, and CT in only 1% [^5f97646d]. Another study of 1,114 patients found no clinically significant findings on neuroimaging when neurologic symptoms were absent [^c59966e4]. Routine neuroimaging rarely changes management or outcomes in uncomplicated syncope [^77452466].

---

### Carotid artery imaging

Carotid imaging similarly has a **low diagnostic yield** in uncomplicated syncope. A review of 5 studies found carotid ultrasound established a diagnosis in only 0.5% of cases [^762b0826]. Carotid stenosis does not cause isolated syncope; when symptomatic, it produces focal neurologic deficits, not transient global hypoperfusion [^e887c4d5]. Routine carotid imaging in syncope without focal findings is therefore not recommended [^9f94eed3].

---

## Clinical scenarios where imaging is indicated

Imaging is appropriate when **specific clinical features** are present:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Indicated imaging** |
|-|-|
| Focal neurologic deficits | Head CT/MRI, carotid ultrasound [^7ae89dcc] [^57e6d9da] |
| Head trauma with concern for intracranial injury | Head CT [^notfound] |
| Suspected stroke or TIA | Head CT/MRI, carotid ultrasound [^f4a5ec3b] [^57e6d9da] |
| Carotid bruit or known carotid disease | Carotid ultrasound [^9d028be1] |

---

## Recommended evaluation approach

For uncomplicated syncope, the **recommended approach** includes:

- **Detailed history and physical examination**: Identify triggers, prodromal symptoms, and risk factors [^7396cc1d].
- **Electrocardiogram (ECG)**: Screen for arrhythmias or conduction abnormalities [^7396cc1d].
- **Risk stratification**: Use validated tools (e.g. SFSR, OESIL) to guide disposition and testing [^49eff331].
- **Targeted testing**: Based on initial evaluation (e.g. echocardiography, ambulatory ECG, tilt table testing) [^e29ba22b].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

Routine head CT/MRI and carotid imaging are **not indicated** for this patient with uncomplicated syncope, a normal neurologic exam, and no head trauma. These tests have low yield and do not change management. Follow guideline-directed evaluation with history, exam, ECG, and risk stratification, and reserve imaging for patients with focal deficits, head trauma, or suspected stroke/TIA [^7ae89dcc] [^a01fbe61] [^38e2a843].

### Evaluation of syncope [^454a9991]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Though relatively common, syncope is a complex presenting symptom defined by a transient loss of consciousness, usually accompanied by falling, and with spontaneous recovery. Syncope must be carefully differentiated from other conditions that may cause a loss of consciousness or falling. Syncope can be classified into four categories: reflex mediated, cardiac, orthostatic, and cerebrovascular. A cardiac cause of syncope is associated with significantly higher rates of morbidity and mortality than other causes. The evaluation of syncope begins with a careful history, physical examination, and electrocardiography. Additional testing should be based on the initial clinical evaluation. Older patients and those with underlying organic heart disease or abnormal electrocardiograms generally will need additional cardiac evaluation, which may include prolonged electrocardiographic monitoring, echocardiography, and exercise stress testing. When structural heart disease is excluded, tests for neurogenic reflex-mediated syncope, such as head-up tilt-table testing and carotid sinus massage, should be performed. The use of tests such as head computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, carotid and transcranial ultrasonography, and electroencephalography to detect cerebrovascular causes of syncope should be reserved for those few patients with syncope whose history suggests a neurologic event or who have focal neurologic signs or symptoms.

### Choosing wisely for syncope: low-value carotid ultrasound use [^063371d2]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

Given that syncope‐related conditions represent approximately 1% to 6% of all hospital admissions in the United States – and result in an annual estimated cost of $2.4 billion, even a modest reduction in low‐value diagnostic testing for this single service could lead to meaningful savings. A recent study suggests that $33 million to $49 million are spent annually on low‐value carotid ultrasound, carotid computed tomography, and carotid magnetic resonance imaging for Medicare patients with syncope in the absence of signs of stroke or TIA. As such, better quantifying the amount of unnecessary diagnostic carotid ultrasound screening is critically important for both clinicians and policy makers.

To better understand the full scope of this problem, we sought to obtain national estimates of the proportion of patients presenting with simple syncope who undergo CDUS annually and the proportion of patients undergoing carotid ultrasound for syncope who had simple syncope. Second, we sought to use charge data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid to estimate the amount of annual spending on this low‐value practice. Finally, to gain clinical insight into the reported low utility of these nonindicated but commonly ordered studies, we manually reviewed 5 years of electronic medical record (EMR) data at a large academic hospital to determine the diagnostic yield of these ultrasound studies and the proportion of studies that lead to a change in clinical management.

### Choosing wisely for syncope: low-value carotid ultrasound use [^0fe6064c]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

This study provides support that routine carotid ultrasonography for syncope is both common nationwide and is of low value. Because clinical leaders and policy makers aim to eliminate wasteful spending without compromising quality, it may be useful to examine ways to curb this unnecessary testing. This may be accomplished by improving awareness of the persistence of this wasteful practice among clinical providers and trainees or by use of electronic clinical decision support to explicitly recommend against carotid ultrasound for this population of patients if a provider attempts to order one for a common syncope workup. Carotid ultrasound evaluation for patients with simple syncope is just an example of the types of practices that need to be identified, enumerated, evaluated, and curtailed so that clinicians can begin to choose more wisely to deliver truly value‐based care.

### Evaluating head CT referral quality and appropriateness in an Italian emergency department: a monocentric retrospective study [^3c0ec07f]. Insights Into Imaging (2025). Medium credibility.

Correlation between quality and appropriateness of head CT referrals and outcomes

Among inappropriate requests (according to ACR criteria) for head CT classified as RI-RADS A or B, 96% were negative. However, 4 patients had positive imaging findings, including: 1 tumor, 1 subgaleal hematoma, 1 arteriovenous malformation, and 1 intraparenchymal hemorrhage (diagnosed on a follow-up CT scan). The main clinical indications among the inappropriate requests were headache (26%) and trauma (25%).

Of patients with inappropriate requests (according to ACR criteria) for head CT classified as RI-RADS C or D, 99% were negative. However, 8 patients had positive imaging findings, including: 3 tumors and 1 subarachnoid hemorrhage on the initial CT scan, 1 aneurysm and 2 carotid stenoses on CT angiography, and 1 ischemia on MRI. The main clinical indications among the inappropriate requests were syncope (22%) and headache (22%).

Of all patients with inappropriate requests for head CT, 98% were negative, with headache (23%) and syncope (21%) being the primary clinical indications. Conversely, among the patients with appropriate requests, 16% were positive, yielding 198 positive findings on the initial CT scan, 29 on the 24-h follow-up CT, 31 on CT angiography, and 24 on MRI. The main clinical indications for appropriate requests were trauma (47%) and stroke (23%).

Analysis of positivity rates revealed a significant difference between appropriate and inappropriate CT scans (11% vs 1%; p -value < 0.001), highlighting that appropriate head CT scans had a significantly higher rate of reporting acute cerebral diseases compared to inappropriate scans.

Appropriate CT requests were significantly more likely to require further diagnostic investigation with CT angiography (RR 1.4, 95% confidence interval: 1.3–1.4; p -value < 0.001) and MRI (RR 1.3, 95% confidence interval: 1.2–1.3; p -value < 0.001) compared to inappropriate requests.

### The yield of computed tomography of the head among patients presenting with syncope: a systematic review [^a54b5bb8]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Overuse of head computed tomography (CT) for syncope has been reported. However, there is no literature synthesis on this overuse. We undertook a systematic review to determine the use and yield of head CT and risk factors for serious intracranial conditions among syncope patients.

Methods

We searched Embase, Medline, and Cochrane databases from inception until June 2017. Studies including adult syncope patients with part or all of patients undergoing CT head were included. We excluded case reports, reviews, letters, and pediatric studies. Two independent reviewers screened the articles and collected data on CT head use, diagnostic yield (proportion with acute hemorrhage, tumors or infarct), and risk of bias. We report pooled percentages, I², and Cochran's Q-test.

Results

Seventeen articles with 3,361 syncope patients were included. In eight ED studies (n = 1,669), 54.4% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 34.9%-73.2%) received head CT with a 3.8% (95% CI = 2.6%-5.1%) diagnostic yield and considerable heterogeneity. In six in-hospital studies (n = 1,289), 44.8% (95% CI = 26.4%-64.1%) received head CT with a 1.2% (95% CI = 0.5%-2.2%) yield and no heterogeneity. In two articles, all patients had CT (yield 2.3%) and the third enrolled patients ≥ 65 years old (yield 7.7%). Abnormal neurologic findings, age ≥ 65 years, trauma, warfarin use, and seizure/stroke history were identified as risk factors. The quality of all articles referenced was strong.

Conclusion

More than half of patients with syncope underwent CT head with a diagnostic yield of 1.1% to 3.8%. A future large prospective study is needed to develop a robust risk tool.

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the evaluation of adult patients with suspected transient ischemic attack in the emergency department [^f4a5ec3b]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Suspected transient ischemic attack (TIA) imaging during initial emergency department workup: For the question of what imaging can be safely delayed, "Level A recommendations. None specified". and "Level B recommendations. None specified". Level C states: "(1) The safety of delaying neuroimaging from the initial ED workup is unknown. If noncontrast brain MRI is not readily available, it is reasonable for physicians to obtain a noncontrast head CT as part of the initial TIA workup to identify TIA mimics (eg, intracranial hemorrhage, mass lesion). However, noncontrast head CT should not be used to identify patients at high short-term risk for stroke". Additionally, "(2) When feasible, physicians should obtain MRI with DWI to identify patients at high short-term risk for stroke". and "(3) When feasible, physicians should obtain cervical vascular imaging (eg, carotid ultrasonography, CTA, or MRA) to identify patients at high short-term risk for stroke". The potential benefit described is that "Immediate noncontrast head CT or noncontrast brain MRI may identify life-threatening TIA mimics in the ED".

### Transient ischemic attack: diagnostic evaluation [^1c67d0f6]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

A transient ischemic attack portends significant risk of a stroke. Consequently, the diagnostic evaluation in the emergency department is focused on identifying high-risk causes so that preventive strategies can be implemented. The evaluation consists of a facilitated evaluation of the patient's metabolic, cardiac, and neurovascular systems. At a minimum, the following tests are recommended: fingerstick glucose level, electrolyte levels, CBC count, urinalysis, and coagulation studies; noncontrast computed tomography (CT) of the head; electrocardiography; and continuous telemetry monitoring. Vascular imaging studies, such as carotid ultrasonography, CT angiography, or magnetic resonance angiography, should be performed on an urgent basis and prioritized according to the patient's risk stratification for disease. Consideration should be given for echocardiography if no large vessel abnormality is identified.

### Choosing wisely for syncope: low-value carotid ultrasound use [^e73eee32]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

The United States spends an estimated $2.7 trillion annually on health care, nearly 19% of the nation's economy. The Institute of Medicine voiced concern regarding the value of this investment, noting that a sizable fraction — $750 billion — may be spent on wasteful, nonproductive care. The Institute of Medicine emphasizes the need to reduce this low‐value care and promote policies that both improve patient health outcomes and reward the delivery of high‐value care.

Similar calls to action can be found in the recently launched "Choosing Wisely" campaign and the American College of Physician's "High‐Value, Cost‐Conscious Care" initiatives, both of which are focused on eliminating unnecessary tests and procedures and shifting spending to proven, high‐value investments. Within these initiatives, much attention has been devoted to eliminating low‐value diagnostic testing. In total, 24 of the 45 wasteful practices initially highlighted by the Choosing Wisely campaign are diagnostic studies. Between 2000 and 2007, diagnostic imaging rose faster than any other physician service among Medicare patients, although some project that 20% to 50% of diagnostic imaging provides no useful information for improving patient care. Despite much attention given to high‐priced items, there has been less focus on lower priced imaging, which may still constitute a substantial amount of spending by virtue of its frequent use.–

One low‐priced but low‐value test is carotid duplex ultrasound (CDUS) for the evaluation of syncope. Recent reports from the European Society of Cardiology's Task Force on Syncope, the American College of Physicians' Clinical Efficacy Assessment Project, and other comprehensive reviews and editorials – have pointed out that CDUS should be used only for patients presenting with concerns of stroke, transient ischemic attacks (TIAs), focal neurological signs, or carotid bruits — and that syncope in the absence of these signs or symptoms is not a result of carotid artery stenosis.

In this paper, we define simple syncope as a syncopal episode not accompanied by focal neurological deficits or other signs and symptoms suggestive of TIA or stroke.

Despite broad consensus in the medical literature that simple, self‐resolving syncope is not caused by carotid arterial occlusive disease, – numerous studies have shown that CDUS testing in syncopal patients remains common practice, even in the absence of neurological signs or symptoms of concern for stroke or TIA.–

### Choosing wisely for syncope: low-value carotid ultrasound use [^fd0b233a]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

Our findings build on this prior body of literature in 3 meaningful ways. First, by using a nationally representative Medicare claims database, we provide the most comprehensive estimates of the proportion of elderly patients with simple syncope that undergo unnecessary imaging (16.2%) and the proportion of carotid imaging studies that are performed for this reason (6.5%). Second, although our manual review comes from a single institution, it is the largest and most focused sample to date to elucidate these trends; prior studies have had smaller samples and did not exclude patients with an appropriate indication (ie, focal neurological signs, bruits, and clinical concern for stroke or TIA at presentation). Consequently, our data provide more precise estimates of the clinical utility of this low‐value study by excluding studies obtained for legitimate clinical indications. Third, our data are particularly relevant to the current discussion regarding the use of payment reform to curtail of low‐value care. Our data span our institution's transition to becoming a Pioneer Accountable Care Organization in 2009, which followed its participation in the Alternative Quality Contract, both of which provided incentives for the institution to curb spending without compromising quality. The persistence of this specific form of low‐value spending may suggest that there are untapped opportunities to meet these twin goals of lower spending and improved quality. Moreover, it may highlight that provider behavior may lag behind institutional goals, even amid payment reforms being enacted as a part of the Affordable Care Act.

Given well‐established clinical guidelinesand broad consensus that carotid ultrasound imaging is not indicated for syncopal patients who lack focal neurological signs or a carotid bruit, its continued use is representative of the type of low‐value care that should be identified, understood, and curtailed to eliminate wasteful spending. The collective expenses of frequently ordered "small‐ticket items" like carotid ultrasound compose a more substantial proportion of wasteful spending than the less frequently used, more expensive technologies. – Given the high prevalence of syncope nationally, the impact of even a small reduction in wasteful spending for syncope could have sizable impact nationally. Our finding that CDUS for simple syncope represents an estimated $73 million to $75 million in wasted Medicare spending builds on prior estimates that low‐value services represent up to 2.7% of all Medicare spending. Savings from eliminating low‐value care such as CDUS for presentations of simple syncope could be directed toward other tests and procedures that yield greater health benefits.

None specified. Level B recommendations. None specified. Level C recommendations. In adult patients with suspected TIA, carotid ultrasonography may be used to exclude severe carotid stenosis because it has accuracy similar to that of MRA or CTA. Screening for severe carotid stenosis by ultrasonography has the potential to reduce cost and exposure to radiation and contrast compared with CTA or MRA, but the use of carotid ultrasonography may miss a small percentage of patients with severe carotid stenosis.

Carotid imaging comparative conclusions — evidence synthesis states that ultrasonography appears to be slightly less sensitive than MRA for detecting severe carotid stenosis, yet the diagnostic test performs well enough clinically to be considered useful in ruling out clinically significant carotid stenosis; it also notes that the specificity of both MRA and DUS for detecting severe carotid stenosis appears to be similar and that there were no studies included directly comparing CTA and DUS.

Risk scores to enable targeted screening of cases in populations with an elevated risk of asymptomatic carotid stenosis have been developed and risk prediction models can be used to select particular individuals for targeted screening to detect asymptomatic carotid stenosis, allowing improved cardiovascular risk management to prevent complications. In a recently published multi-national survey in asymptomatic patients, the first exam used to evaluate carotid bifurcation was ultrasound in 88.8% of cases, CT in 7%, and MR in 4.2%. If a severe degree of stenosis was found in the US analysis, a second level exam was performed (CT in 88% of cases and MR in 12% of cases).

In the case of symptomatic patients, work-up strategies are oriented to the identification of the causes of stroke and therefore imaging of the carotid artery is a mandatory examination. There are significant differences in the imaging strategies according to multiple parameters (geography, level of the hospital (first, second or tertiary level) and the academic / nonacademic institutions) as recently published: In the case of symptomatic patients, half of the centers perform US as the first exam to evaluate carotid arteries (50.4%) followed by CT (41.6%), and then MR (8%). In symptomatic patients that are first studied with US, if a severe degree of stenosis is found, a second level exam is performed (CT in 85% of cases and MR in 15% of cases). Symptomatic persons that are admitted to a hospital with acute stroke symptoms usually undergo CT stroke imaging including a CT angiography of the head and cervical vessels with the ongoing current practice of performing frequently CT of the intracranial vessel at the admission in the symptomatic stroke that could be easily extended from the intracranial level to the cervical level. These data suggest that patients with cerebrovascular symptoms could be directly assessed with second-level imaging. In this scenario, it is also important to underline that in several centers the request for CT or MR after ultrasound is oriented by the detection of a severe degree of stenosis (assessed morphologically or with the PSV values). However, recently published papers have demonstrated that carotid plaque rupture plays a key role also in patients with mild or absence of degree of stenosis (cryptogenic stroke). This information suggests that also subjects that are considered with the absence of severe carotid stenosis could have a vulnerable, eccentric plaque that is the cause of the cerebrovascular symptoms.

Table 2.
Comparison of Patient Cardiovascular Risk Factors

Of the 48 patients with a positive ultrasound, 31 had stenosis of 50% to 69%, 10 had stenosis of 70% to 99%, and 7 had stenosis of 100% (Table 3). Seven (2.2%) of the 313 patients in our sample underwent a change in medications that could potentially target stroke‐risk reduction after a finding of ≥ 50% carotid stenosis on ultrasound, and only 1 such patient (0.3%) subsequently underwent a carotid artery stenting procedure (Table 3), although the consultation note reported asymptomatic carotid disease as the indication for the procedure. Of note, in none of these 7 cases, or in any of the patients with a positive ultrasound, was the cause of syncope attributed to carotid artery stenosis. In addition, 10 (3.2%) of the 313 patients had either retrograde or altered vertebral artery waveforms (data not shown). On further review of the EMR, however, none of these patients were diagnosed with vertebral basilar insufficiency, and all 10 had causal diagnoses for their syncope unrelated to abnormal vertebral artery flow.

### Variation in diagnostic testing for older patients with syncope in the emergency department [^c8e987da]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Older adults presenting with syncope often undergo intensive diagnostic testing with unclear benefit. We determined the variation, frequency, yield, and costs of tests obtained to evaluate older persons with syncope.

Methods

We conducted a prospective, multicenter observational cohort study in 11 academic emergency departments in the United States of 3686 patients aged ≥ 60 years presenting with syncope or presyncope. We measured the frequency, variation, yield, and costs (based on Medicare payment tables) of diagnostic tests performed at the index visit.

Results

While most study rates were similar across sites, some were notably discordant (e.g., carotid ultrasound: mean 9.5%, range 1.1% to 49.3%). The most frequently-obtained diagnostic tests were initial troponin (88.6%), chest x-ray (75.1%), head CT (42.5%) and echocardiogram (35.5%). The yield or proportion of abnormal findings by diagnostic test ranged from 1.9% (electrocardiogram) to 42.0% (coronary angiography). Among the most common tests, echocardiogram had the highest proportion of abnormal results at 22.1%. Echocardiogram was an outlier in total cost at $672,648, and had a cost per abnormal test of $3129.

Conclusion

Variation in diagnostic testing in older patients presenting with syncope exists. The yield and cost per abnormal result for common tests obtained to evaluate syncope are also highly variable. Selecting tests based on history and examination while also prioritizing less resource intensive and higher yield tests may ensure a more informed and cost-effective approach to evaluating older patients with syncope.

### Diagnostic yield of neuroimaging in syncope patients without high-risk symptoms indicating neurological syncope [^c59966e4]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Diagnostic tests are widely used for patients with syncope in the emergency department (ED). This study aimed to determine the diagnostic yield of neuroimaging in patients with syncope without high-risk symptoms.

Methods

Adult patients who presented to the ED with syncope in 2016 were screened retrospectively. Patients who suffered from mild head trauma due to syncope were also included. Patients with neurological examination findings (confusion, amnesia, focal neurological deficit, severe headache, dizziness, nausea and vomiting), patients on anticoagulants, patients with known intracranial malignancies and those whose loss of consciousness was attributed to reasons other than syncope were excluded from the study.

Results

A total of 1114 patients were included in the study. The median age was 48 years (IQR = 34–66 years) and 576 (51.7%) of the patients were male. The neuroimaging tests performed were cranial computerized tomography (CT) in 694 (62.3%) cases and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in 114 (10.2%) cases. Mild head trauma due to syncope was observed in 116 (10.4%) patients. None of the neuroimaging studies revealed any clinically significant findings.

Conclusion

Neuroimaging is not beneficial in patients whose medical history and physical examination do not indicate neurogenic syncope, even if the patient has mild head trauma.

### Carotid artery endarterectomy in patients with symptomatic non-stenotic carotid artery disease [^a6b0018a]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Radiological evaluation

All patients underwent brain and neck CTA and/or MRA and/or MR VWI during presurgical evaluation. CTA was performed on a Siemens single or dual source CT scanner. MRA images were recorded on a 3T MRI scanner (GE 750, GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA) with a 16‐channel head/neck/spine coil covering the head and the neck. CTA and MRA were both used to measure the severity of stenosis of the carotid arteries on axial imaging as a percentage of lumen narrowing as defined by NASCET criteria. A non-stenotic artery (or mild stenosis) was defined as less than 50% stenosis. CTA was used to evaluate for the presence of plaque features such as low-density plaque (LDP) components (defined as hypodensity within the plaque < 50 Hounsfield units), calcification (hyperdensity within the plaque > 120 Hounsfield units) and ulceration (defined as a luminal defect or indentation of the plaque surface > 1000 µm). Intraplaque haemorrhage (IPH) was assessed on MR using T1-weighted magnetisation-prepared rapid acquisition with gradient echo (MPRAGE) sequences in the coronal plane when available. All markers of vulnerability were defined according to previously described criteria. The analysis of preoperative imaging including quantification of the degree of stenosis and biomarkers of vulnerability was performed by a board-certified neuroradiologist (JB) blinded to patient information. The degree of stenosis and presence of vulnerable plaque features were compared between symptomatic carotid arteries and the contralateral carotid in each patient.

Surgical treatment

Carotid revascularisation in the setting of SyNC was performed after informed consent, usually in the case of recurrent ischaemic cerebrovascular events despite maximal medical management (which included dual antiplatelet therapy, statins, etc) and/or findings of plaque vulnerability (such as IPH, LDP, ulceration) on imaging. Two senior neurosurgeons (GL and FM) performed all the surgical procedures under general anaesthesia. Routine intraoperative electroencephalography monitoring for selective intraluminal shunting was used. Follow-up information following CEA was collected from a review of medical records or by telephone survey.

Imaging objectives and timing definitions in suspected TIA — clinicians must choose between immediate and delayed imaging, with the primary goal "to identify serious TIA mimics (eg, intracranial hemorrhage, mass lesion)" and a secondary goal to identify patients at high short‑term stroke risk, "commonly defined as occurring within 2 or 7 days after the initial TIA event". Most literature concerns head CT, brain MRI, or cervical vessel imaging, and "The majority of studies… used a time-based definition of TIA (ie, resolution of neurologic deficit within 24 hours)". Immediate imaging "may reveal acute ischemic lesions… changing the diagnosis to stroke", and because "both TIA and minor stroke have similar short-term ischemic stroke risk", management may be similar regardless of tissue infarction on imaging.

### Common reasons that asymptomatic patients who are 65 years and older receive carotid imaging [^8693775f]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Importance

National guidelines do not agree on the role of carotid screening in asymptomatic patients (ie, patients who have not had a stroke or transient ischemic attack). Recently, several physician organizations participating in the Choosing Wisely campaign have identified carotid imaging in selected asymptomatic populations as being of low value. However, the majority of patients who are evaluated for carotid stenosis and subsequently revascularized are asymptomatic.

Objective

To better understand why asymptomatic patients who undergo revascularization receive initial carotid imaging.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Retrospective cohort study of 4127 Veterans Health Administration patients 65 years and older undergoing carotid revascularization for asymptomatic carotid stenosis between 2005 and 2009.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Indications for carotid ultrasounds were extracted using trained abstractors. Frequency of indications and appropriateness of initial carotid ultrasound imaging for patients within each rating category after the intervention were reported.

Results

The mean (SD) age of this cohort of 4127 patients was 73.6 (5.9) years; 4014 (98.8%) were male. Overall, there were 5226 indications for 4063 carotid ultrasounds. The most common indications listed were carotid bruit (1578 [30.2% of indications]) and follow-up for carotid disease (stenosis/history of carotid disease) in patients who had previously documented carotid stenosis (1087 [20.8% of indications]). Multiple vascular risk factors were the next most common indication listed. Rates of appropriate, uncertain, and inappropriate imaging were 5.4% (227 indications), 83.4% (3387 indications), and 11.3% (458 indications), respectively. Among the most common inappropriate indications were dizziness/vertigo and syncope. Among the 4063 patients, 3373 (83.0%) received a carotid endarterectomy. Overall, 663 procedures were performed in patients 80 years and older.

Conclusions and Relevance

Carotid bruit and follow-up for carotid disease accounted for approximately half of all indications provided by physicians for carotid testing. Strong consideration should be given to improving the evidence base around carotid testing, especially around monitoring stenosis over long periods and evaluating carotid bruits. Targeting carotid ultrasound ordering with decision support tools may also be an important step in reducing use of low-value imaging.

Syncope is a sudden, transient loss of consciousness associated with inability to maintain postural tone followed by spontaneous recovery and return to baseline neurologic status. Global cerebral hypoperfusion is the final pathway common to all presentations of syncope, but this symptom presentation has a broad differential diagnosis. It is important to identify patients whose syncope is a symptom of a potentially life-threatening condition. This article reviews the current status of syncope from the emergency department perspective, focusing on the current evidence behind the various clinical decision rules derived during the past decade.

### Syncope and head CT scans in the emergency department [^426c2b8b]. Emergency Radiology (2005). Low credibility.

Context

Patients presenting with syncope to the emergency department (ED) of a community hospital were evaluated.

Aim

The objective of this study is to examine the use and results of head computerized tomography (CT) scans in patients presenting with syncope to the ED of a community hospital.

Settings and Design

A retrospective chart review of patients presenting with syncope to the emergency room was conducted.

Methods and Materials

We reviewed the charts of patients who presented to the ED over a 6-month period with syncope. When performed, head CT scan findings were noted, and their relationship to the clinical presentation was examined.

Results

One hundred twenty-eight patients were identified. Forty-four patients had their head CT scans performed. In 1 patient, the CT scan showed evidence of infarction in the posterior circulation. In 19 patients, the head CT scan was normal. Twenty-four patients had abnormal findings unrelated to the ED presentation.

Conclusions

Head CT scans were commonly used in our series of syncope patients. Abnormal findings pertinent to the syncope were observed in only 1 patient. A prospective study examining yield in a larger series of patients may help define the utility of this neuroimaging modality in syncope.

Syncope — evaluation and diagnosis research needs state that studies are needed to better understand the interaction and relationships among the presenting symptom of syncope, the cause of syncope, the underlying disease condition, and their effect on clinical outcomes. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are needed to develop structured protocols to evaluate patients with syncope who are at intermediate risk without an immediate presumptive diagnosis, and in addition to the endpoints of diagnostic yield and healthcare utilization, relevant clinical endpoints of nonfatal and fatal outcomes and recurrence of syncope are to be included. RCTs are needed to determine the features of syncope-specialized facilities that are necessary to achieve beneficial outcomes for patient care and to improve efficiency and effectiveness of healthcare delivery, and as technology advances, studies are needed to determine the value of new technology in the evaluation and management of patients with syncope.

Neurological evaluation — clinical conditions associated with syncope describe that in autonomic failure (ANF) the autonomic nervous system (ANS) cannot cope with physiological demands, which is expressed as orthostatic hypotension (OH); there are three categories, including primary ANF (degenerative neurological disease), secondary ANF (autonomic damage from other diseases), and drug-induced OH, the most frequent cause of OH, from agents such as antihypertensives, diuretics, tricyclic antidepressives, phenothiazines, and alcohol; neurological evaluation should be considered in primary ANF, with warning signs including early impotence, disturbed micturition, and later Parkinsonism and ataxia. Cerebrovascular disorders include subclavian steal, a rerouting of blood to the arm through the vertebral artery due to subclavian artery stenosis or occlusion; when detected with ultrasound, steal is asymptomatic in 64%, and a transient ischaemic attack (TIA) is only likely to be due to steal when it is vertebrobasilar and associated with exercise of one arm; there are no reliable reports of isolated loss of consciousness (LOC) without focal neurological symptoms and signs in subclavian steal. TIA related to a carotid artery does not cause T-LOC, whereas TIA of the vertebrobasilar system can cause LOC but there are always focal signs, and for practical purposes a TIA concerns a focal deficit without LOC and syncope the opposite. Migraine is associated with a higher lifetime prevalence and frequency of syncope, but syncope and migraine attacks do not usually occur together. Epilepsy can cause T-LOC in tonic, clonic, tonic–clonic, or atonic generalized seizures with non-responsiveness, falls, and later amnesia, whereas in absence epilepsy in children and partial complex epilepsy in adults consciousness is altered rather than lost and patients remain upright during attacks.

Head and neck: screening recommendations after therapeutic radiation

Physical examination for carotid bruits

In patients with prior neck irradiation, auscultation for carotid bruits can identify asymptomatic atherosclerosis and direct preventive therapy in addition to evaluating for carotid stenosis. The presence of a bruit had a 89% positive predictive value for carotid plaque in a multiethnic, community-based, asymptomatic prospective cohort (mean age: 68 years) and confers a 3 times higher risk of transient ischemic attack or stroke based on a meta-analysis of 17,913 patients and 28 prospective cohort studies in the general population. In ∼30% of noncancer patients with bruit, carotid stenosis > 60% will be detected on carotid ultrasound.

Carotid ultrasound

Despite their positive predictive value for carotid plaque in the community-based cohort study, carotid bruits only had a 6% sensitivity for detecting plaque and 54% sensitivity for detecting carotid stenosis > 60%. Thus, the panel believes that screening with carotid ultrasound is warranted to supplement the physical examination. Carotid atherosclerosis can be detected early after RT on ultrasound and should prompt appropriate risk factor management, as these findings correlate with risk of myocardial infarction and stroke in the general population, even after adjusting for traditional risk factors.

In a cohort of 96 patients, carotid ultrasound identified internal carotid stenosis of ≥ 30% in 28% of patients and critical stenosis in 13%, at a mean of 79.9 months from neck RT. In another cohort of 105 patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma post-RT, carotid ultrasound detected carotid plaque in 38 patients (36%) at a median 48 months from radiation, with atherosclerosis severity increasingly linearly with time. Asymptomatic atherosclerosis can be seen as early as 1 year after RT.

CT neck

Surveillance CT scans should also be reviewed for development of carotid calcifications and atherosclerosis. In a series of 104 patients with laryngeal cancer with pre- and post-radiotherapy CT scans and without baseline atherosclerosis, there was a 48% incidence of new carotid atherosclerosis on follow-up contrast CT scans 4 years post-radiotherapy and a 17% incidence of new carotid calcifications. CT angiography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are not routinely recommended for screening but can be used for further evaluation and characterization of carotid disease as clinically required.

Dysautonomia

Recommended screening for dysautonomia in patients with HNC post-RT focuses on clinical history and examination. In patients with signs or symptoms of dysautonomia, further evaluation and treatment should follow established recommendations.

However, there is no evidence evaluating the safety of delaying neuroimaging in the ED". (2) "Initial noncontrast head CT findings do not reliably predict early stroke in patients presenting with suspected TIA". (3) "Both DWI and cervical vascular imaging predict short-term risk for stroke in patients presenting with suspected TIA". The literature "does not routinely examine whether early recognition of abnormal findings translates into improved outcomes", and "It is unclear whether immediate diagnosis of a serious TIA mimic on initial head CT in the ED… results in improved patient-centered outcomes".

### Evaluating head CT referral quality and appropriateness in an Italian emergency department: a monocentric retrospective study [^1b4d9a50]. Insights Into Imaging (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study shows that the majority of unenhanced head CT requests in the ED were inadequate in terms of quality (79%), especially when a specific diagnostic question is missing, with a high rate of inappropriateness in terms of clinical indication (25% considering only the referrals that could be correctly evaluated). The risk of inappropriate head CT scans could be mitigated by improving the quality of requests, as suggested by the lower number of appropriate requests scored as RI-RADS C or D. This can be attributed to the difficulty emergency physicians face in applying guidelines without a clear diagnostic query. Furthermore, defensive medicine, which is widespread but especially prevalent in emergency settings, plays a significant role, with CTs often requested under the false assumption of improved legal standing.

Headache and syncope, accounting for roughly half of all inappropriate requests, were identified as the leading clinical indications for inappropriateness. This highlights the necessity for enhanced training and education on appropriate CT utilization, particularly in these clinical situations.

Radiation arteritis can lead to significant extracranial carotid artery stenosis, affecting the circle of Willis. Cerebral hypoperfusion due to arterial insufficiency is often considered as a differential diagnosis in cases of syncope but rarely proven. We present a case of a 61-year-old man with repeated episodes of syncope-negative cardiac investigations. He had a history of cervical radiation therapy for tonsillar squamous cell carcinoma 15 years previously. Carotid duplex revealed bilateral carotid occlusive disease. MR angiography showed severe multilevel extracranial carotid stenosis bilaterally with occluded left vertebral artery. A diagnosis of cerebral hypoperfusion was performed following single-photon emission CT scan. The patient underwent a left subclavian to carotid bypass, which alleviated his symptoms.

### Selecting appropriate diagnostic tools for evaluating the patient with syncope / collapse [^6a8cfa38]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

The investigation of syncope is challenging and physicians have an ever-increasing array of diagnostic tools at their disposal. There are two essential goals that drive investigation: risk stratification and identification of etiology. In this review, we outline our approach while providing a synopsis of the available supportive evidence. The key to syncope is in the story as told by the patient and a bystander, since this drives both risk assessment and diagnostic testing. All patients should initially be evaluated with a systematic history and physical examination as well as an ECG. The initial evaluation provides an estimation of risk and directs whether inpatient or outpatient evaluation is appropriate. In a substantial proportion of patients, the etiology will be evident after initial evaluation and no further investigation is required. In the remaining, targeted use of additional investigations in the form of cardiac imaging, provocative testing and/or ambulatory ECG monitoring should be performed. A thoughtful and systematic approach to the investigation of syncope optimizes the diagnostic yield but also ensures efficient usage of limited health care resources.

### Syncope: evaluation and differential diagnosis [^7396cc1d]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Syncope is an abrupt and transient loss of consciousness caused by cerebral hypoperfusion. It accounts for 1% to 1.5% of emergency department visits, resulting in high hospital admission rates and significant medical costs. Syncope is classified as neurally mediated, cardiac, and orthostatic hypotension. Neurally mediated syncope is the most common type and has a benign course, whereas cardiac syncope is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Patients with presyncope have similar prognoses to those with syncope and should undergo a similar evaluation. A standardized approach to syncope evaluation reduces hospital admissions and medical costs, and increases diagnostic accuracy. The initial assessment for all patients presenting with syncope includes a detailed history, physical examination, and electrocardiography. The initial evaluation may diagnose up to 50% of patients and allows immediate short-term risk stratification. Laboratory testing and neuroimaging have a low diagnostic yield and should be ordered only if clinically indicated. Several comparable clinical decision rules can be used to assess the short-term risk of death and the need for hospital admission. Low-risk patients with a single episode of syncope can often be reassured with no further investigation. High-risk patients with cardiovascular or structural heart disease, history concerning for arrhythmia, abnormal electrocardiographic findings, or severe comorbidities should be admitted to the hospital for further evaluation. In cases of unexplained syncope, provocative testing and prolonged electrocardiographic monitoring strategies can be diagnostic. The treatment of neurally mediated and orthostatic hypotension syncope is largely supportive, although severe cases may require pharmacotherapy. Cardiac syncope may require cardiac device placement or ablation.

### Clinical mimics: an emergency medicine-focused review of stroke mimics [^57d318ab]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Stroke is a leading cause of death and disability and most commonly presents with focal neurologic deficit within a specific vascular distribution. Several other conditions may present in a similar manner.

Objectives

This review provides emergency providers with an understanding of stroke mimics, use of thrombolytics in these mimics, and keys to differentiate true stroke from mimic.

Discussion

Stroke has significant morbidity and mortality, and the American Heart Association emphasizes rapid recognition and aggressive treatment for patients with possible stroke-like symptoms, including thrombolytics. However, many conditions mimic the presentation of stroke, with up to a 31% rate of misdiagnosis, leading to potentially harmful treatment. Stroke mimics are conditions that present with stroke-like symptoms, including seizures, headaches, metabolic, infection, space-occupying lesion, neurodegenerative disorder, peripheral neuropathy, syncope, vascular disorder, and functional disorder. Factors of history and physical examination supporting stroke vs. mimic are discussed, though any sudden-onset, objective, focal neurologic deficit in a patient should be assumed acute stroke until proven otherwise. Head computed tomography noncontrast is the first-line imaging modality. Magnetic resonance imaging is the most sensitive and specific imaging modality. Neurology consultation is recommended in the majority of patients. If stroke is suspected after evaluation, shared decision-making for further management and consideration of thrombolytics is recommended.

Conclusions

Stroke mimics present a conundrum for emergency providers. A new focal neurologic deficit warrants rapid evaluation for stroke with neuroimaging and neurology consultation. Several mimics found on assessment may resolve with treatment.

### Clinical mimics: an emergency medicine-focused review of syncope mimics [^ebd945cd]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Syncope is an event that causes a transient loss of consciousness (LOC) secondary to global cerebral hypoperfusion. The transient nature of the event can make diagnosis in the emergency department (ED) difficult, as symptoms have often resolved by time of initial presentation. The symptoms and presentation of syncope are similar to many other conditions, which can lead to difficulty in establishing a diagnosis in the ED.

Objective

This review evaluates patients presenting with a history concerning for possible syncope, mimics of syncope, and approach to managing syncope mimics.

Discussion

Syncope is caused by transient LOC secondary to global cerebral hypoperfusion. Many conditions can present similarly to syncope, making diagnosis in the ED difficult. Some of the most emergent conditions include seizures, stroke, metabolic disorders, and head trauma. Other nonemergent conditions include cataplexy, pseudosyncope, or deconditioning. Many laboratory studies and imaging can be nondiagnostic during ED evaluation. For patients presenting with apparent syncope, immediate treatment should focus on identifying and treating life-threatening conditions. History and physical examination can help guide further diagnostic evaluation and management.

Conclusions

Patients with apparent syncope should be evaluated for potential immediate life-threatening conditions. A thorough history and physical examination can aid in distinguishing syncope from common mimics and help identify and subsequently treat life-threatening conditions.

### Key challenges in the current management of syncope [^2a685e0e]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2012). Medium credibility.

Patients commonly present with syncope at emergency departments and other facilities for urgent care. Syncope is understood by physicians to be a transient, self-terminating period of cerebral hypoperfusion that usually results from systemic hypotension, and clinical guidelines for the care of patients with presumed syncope are available. However, the diagnosis and management of such patients continue to pose important diagnostic, therapeutic, and economic challenges, which are the focus of this Review. First, we discuss how to improve symptom characterization to distinguish syncope from other forms of transient loss of consciousness and syncope mimics. Second, we compare methods of risk stratification in patients with suspected syncope, and recommend the introduction of syncope clinics with enhanced interdisciplinary collaboration to optimize patient care at reduced expense. Third, we highlight the importance of the appropriate selection of diagnostic tools and treatment strategies in these syncope clinics. Finally, we address the difficulties associated with therapy for the most-common form of syncope — vasovagal or reflex syncope.

### Syncope in older adults: challenges, approach and treatment [^98895218]. Age and Ageing (2024). Medium credibility.

Syncope can have devastating consequences, resulting in injuries, accidents or even death. In our ageing society, the subsequent healthcare usage, such as emergency room presentations, surgeries and hospital admissions, forms a significant and growing socioeconomic burden. Causes of syncope in the older adult include orthostatic hypotension, carotid sinus syndrome, vasovagal syncope, structural cardiac abnormalities, cardiac arrhythmias and conduction abnormalities. As stated in the recently published World Falls Guidelines, syncope in older adults often presents as falls, which is either due to amnesia for loss of consciousness, or pre-syncope leading to a fall, especially in those prone to falls with several other risk-factors for falls present. This difference in presentation can hinder the recognition of syncope. In patients with unexplained falls, or in whom the history comprises red flags for potential syncope, special attention to (pre)syncope is therefore warranted. When syncope is mistaken for other causes of a transient loss of consciousness, such as epileptic seizures, or when syncope presents as falls, patients are often referred to multiple specialists, which may in turn lead to excessive and unnecessary diagnostic testing and costs. Specialist services that are able to provide a comprehensive assessment can improve diagnostic yield and minimise diagnostic testing, thus improving patient satisfaction. Comprehensive assessment also leads to reduced length of hospital stay. Increasingly, geriatricians are involved in the assessment of syncope in the older patient, especially given the overlap with falls. Therefore, awareness of causes of syncope, as well as state-of-the-art assessment and treatment, is of great importance.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® syncope [^fb4c15b4]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Syncope and presyncope lead to well over one million emergency room visits in the United States each year. Elucidating the cause of syncope or presyncope, which are grouped together given similar etiologies and outcomes, can be exceedingly difficult given the diverse etiologies. This becomes more challenging as some causes, such as vasovagal syncope, are relatively innocuous while others, such as cardiac-related syncope, carry a significant increased risk of death. While the mainstay of syncope and presyncope assessment is a detailed history and physical examination, imaging can play a role in certain situations. In patients where a cardiovascular etiology is suspected based on the appropriate history, physical examination, and ECG findings, resting transthoracic echocardiography is usually considered appropriate for the initial imaging. While no imaging studies are considered usually appropriate when there is a low probability of cardiac or neurologic pathology, chest radiography may be appropriate in certain clinical situations. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

Methods

This is a substudy of SpecTRA (Spectrometry for Transient Ischemic Attack Rapid Assessment), a multicenter, prospective study aiming to identify a blood biomarker differentiating TIAs or minor ischemic strokes from stroke mimics in patients presenting within 24 hours of symptom onset and referred for an acute neurologic assessment. Patients presented with acute transient or minor neurologic symptoms and were suspected of having experienced either a minor ischemic cerebrovascular event or a stroke mimic and were referred to stroke neurology for further evaluation. SpecTRA enrolled patients between December 2013 and March 2017. The SpecTRA study received institutional approvals from the participating hospitals' ethics review board for research using human subjects, and written informed consent was obtained from all patients enrolled. The data that support the findings of this study are available from the senior author upon reasonable request.

Study Participants

A minor symptom was defined as a National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score of 3 or lower. The SpecTRA study required a clinical evaluation by a neurologist with stroke expertise at least once between symptom onset and 90 days after onset as well as having brain MRI within 7 days of the event or computed tomography and computed tomographic angiography within 24 hours of the event. All other investigations and clinical follow‐up were completed as was clinically routine. Our main analysis was restricted to those with transient neurological deficits, defined by self‐report ("Does the patient feel all symptoms of any kind related to this event have resolved [ie, focal symptoms or associated symptoms])?" We also evaluated those with no clinical deficits on neurological examination irrespective of self‐reported symptoms, and those with resolved symptoms on self‐report in addition to no new deficits on examination.

Symptom Type and Neurological Examination

We categorized symptoms as focal only or nonfocal/mixed. Focal neurologic symptoms included any motor, sensory, vision, or speech (aphasia or dysarthria) deficits. Nonfocal symptoms included the migration of symptoms that took longer than 2 minutes, symptoms affected by changes in head position, headache, neck pain, photophobia, eyelid droop, vertigo, unsteady gait, nausea, vomiting, feeling drunk, confusion, disorientation, difficulty concentrating, visuospatial difficulties, amnesia, fatigue, dizziness, involuntary movement, anxiety, or cardiac symptoms (shortness of breath, chest pain, palpitations, syncope, or presyncope). Symptoms were ascertained by study coordinators and investigators at the time of enrollment. A stroke neurologist documented whether the new neurological deficit had resolved on detailed examination.

### ACC / AHA / HRS versus ESC guidelines for the diagnosis and management of Syncope: JACC guideline comparison [^3d47bb61]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Syncope is a commonly encountered and challenging problem in medical practice. Presentations are variable, and the causal mechanism often remains elusive even after extensive (and often expensive) evaluation. Clinical practice guidelines have been developed to help guide the multidisciplinary approach necessary to diagnose and manage the broad spectrum of patients presenting with syncope. The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association, in collaboration with the Heart Rhythm Society, published its first syncope guidelines in 2017. The European Society of Cardiology released the fourth iteration of its syncope guidelines in 2018. This review highlights the differences and congruencies between the 2 sets of recommendations, their implications for clinical practice, the remaining gaps in understanding, and areas of future research.

Syncope implementation studies

Our findings go beyond previous implementation studies as no studies investigated the simultaneous implementation of the syncope guidelines and quick referrals to a syncope unit. A multicentre study in Italy showed that a structured diagnostic algorithm at the ED based on the syncope guidelines improved the diagnostic yield significantly, but without a control group. Another Italian study showed that a standardised care pathway led to a higher diagnostic yield than usual care. Although the study included a control group, the intervention only comprehended the ED evaluation. A recent Dutch study showed that evaluation in the ED by a research physician with strict adherence to the ESC guidelines improved the proportion of correct diagnoses from 65 to 80%. An educational programme promoting the ESC guidelines had only a limited impact on syncope care and did not improve cost-effectiveness, thus underscoring the complexity of guideline implementation in the ED. While education also constituted a key element of our intervention, we additionally offered quick referral routes for patients with intermediate risk. This might explain why our study yielded better results than the former educational intervention study. In a single-centre study in Ireland, ESC Syncope Guidelines implementation was carried out by introducing a local Integrated Care Plan. Local physicians were instructed several times prior to implementation and during 4 weeks afterwards. This resulted in increased appropriate referral rates to the syncope unit. The FAST II study demonstrated the added value of a tertiary syncope unit by demonstrating a high diagnostic yield, accuracy and safety. Notably, those who were diagnosed with reflex syncope underwent a median of nine tests prior to referral. The study also suggested a knowledge gap as often no ancillary testing was needed to yield a highly reliable diagnosis despite multiple consultations by various specialties. Initial orthostatic hypotension was identified as a frequent blind spot which is in line with the improved diagnostic yield for BP-related causes of syncope we found following ESC Syncope Guidelines implementation. Similarly, a dedicated outpatient evaluation including tilt testing in cases with unexplained syncope presenting to the ED in Malmö considerably improved diagnostic efficacy and accuracy. As in our study, the majority of cases in this cohort were found to have BP-related causes of syncope including vasovagal syncope, carotid sinus hypersensitivity and orthostatic hypotension. We studied the BP-related causes as a composite outcome as we anticipated difficulties in classification due to incomplete evaluation (e.g. no standing test) or incomplete records (e.g. no mention of the presence or absence of autonomic activation). Although our primary analysis focussed on the accuracy of identifying the major TLOC groups, the classification of BP-related syncope matched the reference diagnosis more frequently in the syncope guidelines group compared to usual care (Additional file 1). In line with previous studies, we found that hospitalisation was the primary driver of syncope-related healthcare costs. Annual admission costs exceeded $2.4 billion in the USA, as high as those for HIV and asthma. A recent survey reported higher admission rates among patients with lower-risk syncope in regions with higher malpractice claims, suggesting defensive medicine. While the admission rate significantly declined following our intervention, the overall syncope-related health costs between the groups did not reach significance, probably due to a slight increase in outpatient evaluations in the syncope guidelines group. As our study was powered for diagnostic outcomes, the lack of statistical significance of differences between types of healthcare costs and absenteeism does not allow strong conclusions. However, these differences were mostly in favour of our intervention, and the combined syncope-related societal costs were significantly lower following our intervention.

### 2021 guideline for the prevention of stroke in patients with stroke and transient ischemic attack: a guideline from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^77329f84]. Stroke (2021). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for acute ischemic stroke, more specifically with respect to CTA/MRA, for acute evaluation, AHA/ASA 2021 guidelines recommend to obtain CTA or MRA (or carotid ultrasound) to screen for carotid stenosis in patients with symptomatic anterior circulation cerebral infarction or TIA eligible for revascularization.
