## Question

When do menstrual periods resume after an elective termination?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking when menstrual periods typically resume after an elective termination. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the immediate post-abortion endocrine physiology, particularly the rate of hCG decline and resumption of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis. Then, I should determine how quickly ovulation returns. Next, I will translate ovulation timing into the expected timing of first menses using the luteal-phase interval. After that, I need to consider how abortion method, gestational age, and individual variability modify this, and finally, I must factor in how immediate initiation of contraception alters bleeding patterns and provide practical counseling on usual versus normal ranges and when to evaluate absent menses, with fertility warnings before the first period, anchoring each step in the best available data.

> Let me first confirm the physiological starting point. After a completed abortion, hCG falls rapidly, which permits ovarian activity to resume; in a prospective physiologic study after mifepristone–misoprostol, mean hCG declined about 70% by Day 3, 91% by Day 5, and approximately 97–99% by Days 7–14, and importantly this decline did not vary by baseline hCG or gestational age within the studied range, supporting prompt endocrine recovery once the pregnancy is resolved [^1153CBqf].

> Next, I should review the timing of the first ovulation because menses follows ovulation. Wait, let me verify the range estimates: a systematic review reports ovulation can return as early as 8–10 days and usually within 1 month after induced or spontaneous abortion, while a dedicated substudy measuring progesterone showed a mean time-to-ovulation of 20.6 ± 5.1 days, with a range of 8–36 days following mifepristone–misoprostol, which provides both an early boundary and an expected average for planning and counseling.

> Now, I will translate ovulation timing into expected menses using the luteal interval. I need to check my assumption: with a roughly two-week luteal phase, the earliest menses would be roughly 8–10 days (earliest ovulation) plus about 14 days, placing the earliest period around 22–24 days post-abortion; using the mean ovulation around 20–21 days, first menses would cluster near 34–35 days (about 5 weeks), yielding a typical clinical window of about 4–8 weeks for most patients, which aligns with the observed variability in ovulation return reported in the literature [^114rJKro] [^112GZuRo].

> Hold on, I should verify how contraception changes this picture, because immediate initiation is common and can mask or shift the first "period". Clinical guidance supports starting hormonal contraception immediately after abortion, and FDA labeling for combined oral contraceptives and the vaginal ring explicitly allows immediate post–first-trimester initiation, which is useful since fertility can return before menses; however, progestin-only and combined methods can cause irregular bleeding or amenorrhea, especially with methods like DMPA, so the "first period" may be delayed, lighter, irregular, or absent by design, which should be anticipated in counseling [^1177BZYp] [^112fXfZs] [^116eEkoj] [^111Bk4ob] [^116XTWjv].

> I will now examine key modifiers. Let me think about gestational age and abortion method: although higher initial hCG might suggest slower clearance, the prospective hCG study did not find differences in percent decline by baseline hCG or gestational age across ≤ 63 days, supporting similar hormonal resolution within early gestations; medical and surgical abortions both result in rapid endocrine normalization, and individual variability is substantial, with ovulation documented from 8 to 36 days, so patient-specific counseling should emphasize this spread rather than a single date [^1153CBqf] [^114rJKro].

> Next, I should review follow-up and safety thresholds. But wait, what if menses has not returned? Since ovulation precedes menses and ongoing or new pregnancy is possible, patients should have contraception in place promptly; for those not using hormones, absent menses by about 8 weeks warrants evaluation for ongoing pregnancy, retained tissue, or new conception, and this evaluation can follow established post-abortion follow-up practices using low-sensitivity urine testing, ultrasound, or serial hCG as clinically indicated; ongoing pregnancies after medication abortion can present early or only after missed menses, so maintaining a low threshold for assessment is prudent [^1177BZYp] [^115sRCkR] [^116dq8nw] [^113vGpK7].

> Putting this together, I should double-check the counseling message: for patients not starting hormones, most will see their first period around 4–6 weeks, with a normal range of roughly 3–8 weeks; because fertility returns before the first period, emphasize immediate contraception if pregnancy prevention is desired, and clarify that immediate hormonal methods may alter or suppress the first "period", which is expected rather than pathological; advise evaluation if no bleeding by about 8 weeks or earlier if pregnancy symptoms or concerning signs arise, using appropriate testing pathways [^114rJKro] [^112GZuRo] [^1177BZYp] [^111Bk4ob] [^113vGpK7].

> Summary answer: Menstrual periods typically resume about 4–6 weeks after an elective abortion, with a normal range of approximately 3–8 weeks, driven by ovulation returning on average near 3 weeks post-procedure (range 8–36 days); because ovulation precedes menses, initiate contraception immediately if pregnancy prevention is desired, and counsel that immediate hormonal contraception can cause irregular bleeding or amenorrhea that may mask the first "period", prompting evaluation if there is no bleeding by around 8 weeks or earlier if pregnancy symptoms occur [^114rJKro] [^112GZuRo] [^1177BZYp] [^111Bk4ob].

---

Menses typically return within **4–6 weeks** after elective termination, with **ovulation as early as 8–10 days** [^112GZuRo] post-procedure. Medical and surgical abortions follow similar timelines, but hormonal contraception initiated immediately [^113L3a97] may delay or alter bleeding patterns [^111Bk4ob]. If menses have not returned by 6–8 weeks, evaluate for retained products of conception, infection, or Asherman's syndrome. Immediate **contraception** [^1177BZYp] is recommended to prevent rapid return to fertility and repeat pregnancy [^112GZuRo].

---

## Timeline for return of menses

- **Ovulation resumption**: Ovulation can occur as early as 8–10 days post-abortion, usually within 1 month [^112GZuRo] [^114rJKro].

- **Menstrual return**: Menses typically return within 4–6 weeks after elective termination [^112GZuRo].

- **Method comparison**: Medical and surgical abortions have similar timelines for ovulation and menstrual resumption.

---

## Factors influencing return of menses

The timing of menstrual resumption is influenced by several factors: **higher gestational age at termination may slightly delay return**, immediate initiation of hormonal contraception can delay or alter bleeding patterns [^111Bk4ob], and individual factors such as age, BMI, and baseline cycle regularity also affect timing.

---

## Differences between medical and surgical abortion

**Medical abortion** uses mifepristone and misoprostol; ovulation returns on average 20.6 ± 5.1 days post-mifepristone [^114rJKro]. **Surgical abortion** involves vacuum aspiration or dilation and curettage, with ovulation and menses returning on a similar timeline.

---

## Impact of hormonal contraception

- **Immediate initiation**: Can delay or alter bleeding patterns, causing irregular bleeding or amenorrhea [^111Bk4ob] [^113L3a97].

- **Depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA)**: Often causes amenorrhea or irregular bleeding, especially in the first year [^111Bk4ob] [^116XTWjv].

- **Combined hormonal contraception**: May cause irregular bleeding initially, then regular cycles with continued use [^1177BZYp].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Immediate **contraception** is recommended to prevent rapid return of fertility and repeat pregnancy [^113vGpK7] [^112GZuRo]. Clinicians should counsel patients on expected bleeding patterns and when to seek care; they should evaluate persistent bleeding or amenorrhea beyond 6–8 weeks for retained products of conception, infection, or Asherman's syndrome.

---

## Potential complications delaying menstrual return

- **Retained products of conception**: Can cause prolonged bleeding or delayed menses.

- **Infection**: Endometritis or pelvic infection can delay menstrual resumption.

- **Asherman's syndrome**: Intrauterine adhesions may cause amenorrhea or irregular cycles.

---

## Patient counseling and follow-up care

Counsel patients on expected bleeding patterns and clear indications to seek care [^113vGpK7]. Arrange **follow-up** to confirm abortion completion, address complications, and promptly discuss and initiate appropriate contraception [^116dq8nw]. Menses typically return within 4–6 weeks after elective termination, with **ovulation as early as 8–10 days** [^112GZuRo]. Immediate **contraception** [^1177BZYp] is recommended, and persistent amenorrhea or irregular bleeding beyond 6–8 weeks warrants evaluation.

### Abnormal uterine bleeding associated with hormonal contraception [^111Bk4ob]. American Family Physician (2024). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances of abnormal uterine bleeding, particularly in patients using hormonal contraception, AAFP 2024 guidelines recommend counseling patients using depot medroxyprogesterone acetate. Most individuals are expected to experience amenorrhea and lighter menses with continued use after 6–12 months.

### Systemic hormonal contraception initiation after abortion: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^112GZuRo]. Contraception (2021). Low credibility.

Contraceptive initiation after abortion is important for those who desire delayed or no future pregnancy. Following an induced or spontaneous abortion, ovulation can return as early as 8 to 10 days and usually within 1 month. Reports of intercourse within 2 weeks after an induced abortion are common. Moreover, contraceptive counseling and services are considered a human right and should be available and included as a routine component of postabortion care.

Currently, recommendations in the World Health Organization's (WHO) medical eligibility criteria for contraceptive use state that there are no restrictions for the use of combined estrogen-progestogen (combined hormonal) or progestogen-only methods (not including intrauterine devices [IUDs]) immediately following a first-trimester abortion, second-trimester abortion, or septic abortion (Category 1). However, medical abortion regimens that include mifepristone, an antiprogestogen, could have decreased effectiveness with concomitant administration of progestogen-containing contraceptive methods. Additionally, immediate use of hormonal contraceptive methods after an abortion could cause less predictable bleeding patterns, which could affect satisfaction and continuation.

The two objectives of this systematic review are to assess the effect of hormonal contraception initiation on medical abortion effectiveness (abortion success) and to assess the safety of hormonal contraceptive methods following an induced (medical or surgical), spontaneous, or septic abortion. The focus is on non-IUD hormonal methods.

### Routine follow-up visits after first-trimester induced abortion [^116NckZF]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2004). Low credibility.

Routine follow-up visits after abortion are intended to confirm that the abortion is complete and to diagnose and treat complications. Many clinicians also take advantage of the follow-up visit to provide general reproductive health care, including discussing contraceptive plans and providing family planning services, diagnosing sexually transmitted infections, performing a Pap test, or discussing abnormal Pap results. We reviewed the evidence related to the routine post-abortion follow-up visit. Other than mifepristone medical abortion performed at 50 days of gestation or later and methotrexate medical abortion, we found little evidence that mandatory follow-up visits typically detect conditions that women themselves could not be taught to recognize. In addition, the natural history of the most severe complications after abortion — infection and unrecognized ectopic pregnancy — have time courses inconsistent with the usual timing of the follow-up visit.

Costs associated with this visit can be significant. These include travel expenses, lost wages, childcare expenses, privacy and emotional burdens for women, and scheduling disruptions and the related opportunity costs caused by "no-shows" for the provider. Follow-up appointments should be scheduled for those women likely to benefit from a physical examination. For the remainder of women, simple instructions and advice about detecting complications, possibly coupled with telephone follow-up, might suffice. Although arguably valuable in their own right, counseling, family planning services, or sexually transmitted infection diagnosis and treatment opportunities may not always require an in-person follow-up visit.

### Medical abortion [^111CRb6B]. Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Canada (2016). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for termination of pregnancy, specifically in managing ongoing pregnancy, the SOGC 2016 guidelines recommend administering repeat misoprostol or performing surgical evacuation in females with an ongoing pregnancy at the first follow-up after an attempted medical abortion with mifepristone/misoprostol.

### Does a short luteal phase correlate with an increased risk of miscarriage? A cohort study [^112BRwJj]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Low credibility.

The goal of this study was to assess if there is an association between luteal phase length, a potentially modifiable risk factor, and miscarriage rates. Since the length of the luteal phase is determined by the levels and duration of progesterone, the primary hormone responsible for preparing and maintaining the uterine lining in the second half of the cycle, we hypothesized that women with short luteal phases would have a higher risk of miscarriage. However, our results showed no difference in miscarriage rates with at least one short luteal phase in the three cycles prior to the conception cycle. We also found no impact of prior anovulatory cycles.

We did note a possible increased relative risk of miscarriage if women had a short luteal phase in all three tracked cycles preceding conception, but this was based on only five women and two miscarriages in that group. The overall miscarriage rate in our study was 18.7%, which is consistent with the pooled risk of miscarriage of 15.3% in all recognized pregnancies from a review of nine large cohort studies in Europe and North America. However, this overall rate of 18.7% may not reflect rates in sub-populations of patients with subfertility or history of miscarriage.

### Abortion regulation in Europe in the era of COVID-19: A spectrum of policy responses [^113Coq18]. BMJ Sexual & Reproductive Health (2021). Low credibility.

Abortion is an essential component of women's sexual and reproductive care. While extremely safe under recommended procedures, it is responsible for substantial maternal morbidity and mortality when women do not have access to safe abortion care. Abortion is one of the most common procedures for women of reproductive age in Europe, with an annual incidence rate ranging from 6.4/1000 women aged 15–44 years (Switzerland) to 19.2/1000 (Sweden) in countries with complete official statistics. Over a one-month period, more than 34,000 abortions are estimated to take place in France, England, and Wales together.

The need for abortion is likely to have increased in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe, given economic uncertainties, rising reports of sexual violence, and limited access to contraception. However, the unprecedented public health action to 'bend the curve' of the pandemic is raising concern over women's ability to access this essential service, due to restrictions in movement and limited availability of non-COVID-related health services, including elective interventions.

These concerns are heightened in the context of abortion, where politics often trumps evidence. With each passing week of political inaction, thousands of women are denied treatment that cannot be postponed and face the prospect of carrying an unwanted pregnancy to term or undergoing unsafe procedures.

### Can we identify women at risk of more than one termination of pregnancy [^112DHiq3]. Contraception (2005). Low credibility.

One in five women will have more than one abortion in her lifetime. This study was designed to identify risk factors in women requesting termination of pregnancy (TOP) after previous TOPs, so that women at risk of recurrence attending for the first time could be identified. A retrospective case note review of 358 women undergoing TOP during October and November 2000 was performed. Twenty-six percent of women had had a previous TOP. Women undergoing a second or subsequent therapeutic abortion were more likely to be older and have experienced more pregnancies to full term; however, these two factors were confounded. When women were both parous and deprived, the risk of them having had more than one TOP was over 50%.

### Myfembree [^112MKTmQ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Post-study menstrual status was available for 55 women in Study S1 and 59 women in Study S2 who were treated with MYFEMBREE and either prematurely discontinued the study or did not continue into the extension study. For these women, 83.6% (46/55) in Study S1 and 84.7% (50/59) in Study S2 resumed menses. The mean time from the last dose to the occurrence of menses was 27.1 days in Study S1 and 39.2 days in Study S2. The mean time to occurrence of menses was longer for women who achieved amenorrhea, at 34.3 days and 42.8 days in Studies S1 and S2, respectively, compared with women without amenorrhea, at 21.0 days and 32.1 days in Studies S1 and S2, respectively, during the last 28 days of treatment.

After 12 months of treatment with MYFEMBREE (Study S1 or Study S2, then Study S3), 97.9% (46/47) of women resumed menses. The mean time from the last dose of the drug to the occurrence of menses was 36.7 days.

Women who did not have a return to menses included those who had surgery, used alternative medications associated with amenorrhea, or became pregnant.

### Effectiveness, safety and acceptability of medical abortion at home versus in the clinic: A systematic review and meta-analysis in response to COVID-19 [^117718zg]. BMJ Global Health (2020). Low credibility.

Studies conducted follow-up with participants 10–20 days after mifepristone administration or after the completion of post-treatment menstruation. Evidence from non-randomized studies (NRSs) that reported on compliance showed no significant differences in compliance with the medical abortion protocol between the two groups.

Three studies found that the average proportion of home-based participants who completed the medical abortion regimen perfectly was 98.3% (2642/2687), compared with 98.0% (295/301) of women in the provider-administered group. Similarly, four studies reported that only 1.1% (26/2339) of women in the home-based group did not take the misoprostol on time, compared with 1.9% (5/269) in the clinic-based group. In the home-based group, an average of 1.5% (41/2687) did not return to the clinic for follow-up, compared with 3.0% (9/301) of women in the clinic-based group.

Data from 12 NRSs found that, on average, 77.3% (4377/5600) of home-based participants had companionship during their abortion.

### Randomized trial of oral versus vaginal misoprostol at one day after mifepristone for early medical abortion [^1168wF6n]. Contraception (2001). Low credibility.

Mifepristone was recently approved in the United States. Regimens with shorter intervals may be more acceptable. The objective of this study was to determine whether the oral route of misoprostol was as effective as the vaginal route of misoprostol one day after mifepristone. This was a prospective, open-labeled, randomized trial involving healthy adult women up to 63 days pregnant who sought a medical abortion. Participants were randomized to use either two doses of oral misoprostol 400 micrograms taken 2 hours apart or 800 micrograms of misoprostol administered vaginally. Women self-administered misoprostol one day after taking one-third of the standard dose of mifepristone (200 mg) orally. They then returned to the clinic up to five days later for a repeat sonogram evaluation.

- **Follow-up interventions**: A dose of vaginal misoprostol was administered to women with a continuing pregnancy, who then returned one day later for Day 15.

The primary outcome measures were a complete medical abortion by the first or second follow-up visits. Surgical intervention was indicated for continuing pregnancy at the second follow-up visit, excessive bleeding, or the presence of persistent products of conception five weeks later. One thousand one hundred sixty-eight women were enrolled. Of the 1,144 (98%) women who complied with their random assignment, two oral doses of misoprostol (800 micrograms total) were 90% effective at inducing an abortion by the first follow-up visit, compared with one dose of vaginal misoprostol, which was 97% effective (χ² = 23.95, p = 0.001). By the second follow-up visit, the complete abortion rate was 95% for oral misoprostol and 99% for vaginal misoprostol (χ² = 21.76, p = 0.001).

### Acog practice bulletin. Clinical management guidelines of obstetrician-gynecologists. Number 67, October 2005. Medical management of abortion [^1128LFJP]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2005). Low credibility.

Over the past two decades, medical methods of abortion have been developed throughout the world and are now used in the United States. Medical abortion, which involves the use of medications to induce an abortion rather than a surgical abortion, is an option for women who wish to terminate a pregnancy up to 63 days of gestation (calculated from the first day of the last menstrual period). Medical abortions currently account for 6% of all abortions in the United States. The purpose of this document is to present evidence of the effectiveness, benefits, and risks of medical abortion and provide a framework for the evaluation and counseling of women who are considering medical abortion.

### Depo-Provera [^116XTWjv]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

With Depo-Provera CI, changes in the normal menstrual cycle are the most frequently reported side effect by women using it for birth control. During the first year, you may experience: irregular or unpredictable bleeding or spotting, an increase or decrease in menstrual bleeding, or no bleeding at all. Clinical studies show that 55% of women reported no menstrual bleeding (amenorrhea) after one year of use, and 68% reported no menstrual bleeding after two years of use.

During the period of Depo-Provera CI use, you may skip a period or your periods may cease altogether. Regular shots every three months generally indicate that pregnancy is unlikely. However, if you suspect you may be pregnant, consult your healthcare professional.

Unusually heavy or continuous bleeding is not typical with Depo-Provera CI. If this occurs, seek medical advice promptly. With ongoing use, bleeding usually decreases, and many women stop having periods entirely. Upon discontinuing Depo-Provera CI, menstrual cycles typically return to normal over time.

### Medical methods for first trimester abortion [^112HDGYk]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Surgical abortion up to 63 days by vacuum aspiration or dilatation and curettage has been the method of choice since the 1960s. Medical abortion became an alternative method of first-trimester pregnancy termination with the availability of prostaglandins in the early 1970s and antiprogestogens in the 1980s. The most widely researched drugs are prostaglandins (PGs) alone, mifepristone alone, methotrexate alone, mifepristone with prostaglandins, and methotrexate with prostaglandins.

- **Objectives**: To compare different medical methods for first-trimester abortion.

- **Search strategy**: The Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, MEDLINE, and Popline were systematically searched. Reference lists of retrieved papers were also searched, and experts in WHO/HRP were contacted.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized controlled trials comparing different medical methods (e.g. single drug or combination), ways of application, or different dose regimens, single or combined, for medical abortion were considered. Trials were assessed and included if they had adequate concealment of allocation, randomization procedure, and follow-up. Women, pregnant in the first trimester and undergoing medical abortion, were the participants. Different medical methods used for first-trimester abortion, compared with each other or placebo, were included. The outcomes sought include mortality, failure to achieve complete abortion, surgical evacuation (as emergency procedure, non-emergency procedure, or undefined), ongoing pregnancy at follow-up, and time until passing of conceptus (> 3–6 hours).

### Estarylla [^112fXfZs]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **How to take Estarylla**:

- **Starting Estarylla after abortion or miscarriage**:
	- **First trimester**: After a first-trimester abortion or miscarriage, Estarylla may be started immediately. An additional method of contraception is not needed if Estarylla is started immediately. If Estarylla is not started within 5 days after termination of the pregnancy, the patient should use additional non-hormonal contraception (such as condoms and spermicide) for the first seven days of her first cycle blister pack of Estarylla.

	- **Second trimester**: Do not start until 4 weeks following a second-trimester abortion or miscarriage, due to the increased risk of thromboembolic disease. Start Estarylla by following the instructions in Table 1 for Day 1 or Sunday start, as desired. If using Sunday start, use additional non-hormonal contraception (such as condoms and spermicide) for the first seven days of the patient's first cycle blister pack of Estarylla [see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4), WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.1), and FDA-APPROVED PATIENT LABELING].

- **Starting Estarylla after childbirth**: Do not start until 4 weeks after delivery, due to the increased risk of thromboembolic disease. Start contraceptive therapy with Estarylla, following the instructions in Table 1 for women not currently using hormonal contraception. Estarylla is not recommended for use in lactating women [see USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS (8.3)]. If the woman has not yet had a period postpartum, consider the possibility of ovulation and conception occurring prior to use of Estarylla [see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4), WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.1)].

### Extending outpatient medical abortion services through 70 days of gestational age [^114QVxrz]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2012). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to estimate the efficacy and acceptability of medical abortion at 64–70 days from the last menstrual period (LMP) and to compare it with the already proven 57–63 days from LMP gestational age range.

Methods: This prospective, comparative, open-label trial enrolled 729 women with pregnancies 57–70 days from LMP requesting abortion at six U.S. clinics. Medical abortions were managed with 200 mg mifepristone and 800 micrograms buccal misoprostol according to the sites' service delivery protocols. Follow-up visits occurred 7–14 days after mifepristone administration, and an abortion was considered complete if surgical intervention was not performed. Success, ongoing pregnancy, and acceptability rates were compared.

Results: A total of 629 cases were analyzable for efficacy. Success rates were similar in the two groups [57–63 days group: 93.5%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 90–96; 64–70 days group: 92.8%, 95% CI 89–95]. Ongoing pregnancy rates also did not differ significantly [57–63 days: 3.1%, 95% CI 1.6–5.8; 64–70 days: 3.0%, 95% CI 1.5–5.7]. Acceptability was high and similar in both arms, with most women (57–63 days: 87.4%; 64–70 days: 88.3%) reporting that their experience was either very satisfactory or satisfactory.

In conclusion, medical abortion with mifepristone and misoprostol in outpatient settings is an efficacious and acceptable method of ending pregnancies at 64–70 days from LMP and can be offered without alteration of existing services.

Clinical trial registration: clinicaltrials.gov, www.clinicaltrials.gov, NCT00997347.

### Abnormal uterine bleeding in premenopausal women [^112xyXhG]. American Family Physician (2019). High credibility.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for abnormal uterine bleeding, specifically in the context of intrauterine devices, the AAFP 2019 guidelines recommend offering a 20 mcg/day formulation of the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system over other medical therapies for reducing heavy menstrual bleeding.

### Serum human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) trend within the first few days after medical abortion: A prospective study [^1153CBqf]. Contraception (2017). High credibility.

To prospectively describe the decline in serum human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) in the first five days after complete medical abortion and evaluate the influence of initial hCG and gestational duration, we conducted a prospective, physiologic study of women ≤ 63 days gestation. These participants underwent medical abortion with 200 mg mifepristone and 800 mcg buccal misoprostol. Enrollment was stratified into two gestational cohorts, < 49 days and 49–63 days, to ensure gestational variability. Serum quantitative hCG values were collected on Day 1 (day of mifepristone), Day 3, Day 5, and a routine follow-up hCG on Days 7–14. We calculated the percent hCG decline from Day 1 to each repeat measure and evaluated trends based on initial serum hCG level and gestation.

We enrolled 66 women, 59 of whom were protocol-adherent and included in our analysis. Mean gestation on Day 1 was 49 days, and mean baseline hCG was 72,332 IU. Fifty-seven subjects (97%) had a complete medical abortion without further intervention. The mean serum hCG decline among subjects with complete medical abortion was 70.0 ± 10.6% [range 36.9–98.6%] on Day 3 and 91.4 ± 4.4% [range 68.4–97.7%] on Day 5. The mean serum hCG decline from Day 1 to routine follow-up on Days 7–9 was 97.1 ± 1.7% [range 92.4–99.2%], from Day 1 to Day 10–11 was 98.5 ± 1.4% [range 94.7–99.6%], and from Day 1 to Day 12–14 was 98.7 ± 2.8% [range 86.7–99.9%]. There was no difference in percent hCG decline stratified by initial hCG or gestation.

There is a rapid and predictable decline in serum hCG as early as Day 5 after complete medical abortion.

### Mifepristone and misoprostol compared with misoprostol alone for second-trimester abortion: A randomized controlled trial [^117Hv6nw]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2011). High credibility.

To estimate the clinical benefit of pretreatment with mifepristone followed by misoprostol compared with misoprostol alone for second-trimester abortion, a study was conducted.

Two hundred sixty women with live fetuses of gestational ages 14–21 weeks were enrolled in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial in Vietnam. Eligible consenting women received either mifepristone or placebo to take on their own at home and were scheduled to return to the hospital the next day. At the hospital, women were administered 400 micrograms of buccal misoprostol every 3 hours, up to five doses, until both the fetus and placenta were expelled. Efficacy was evaluated 15 hours after misoprostol dosing began, and the procedure was considered complete if uterine evacuation was achieved without recourse to surgical evacuation.

Pretreatment with mifepristone resulted in more than twice the chance of complete uterine evacuation in 15 hours (79.8% compared with 36.9%, relative risk 2.16, 95% confidence interval 1.70–2.75). The mean induction-to-abortion interval for complete uterine evacuations was statistically significantly shorter among participants pretreated with mifepristone compared with those given misoprostol alone (8.1, standard deviation 2.8, range 2.5–14.8; and 10.6, standard deviation 2.5, range 6.5–15.5 hours, respectively; p < 0.001). The side-effect profiles for the two regimens did not differ significantly, and acceptability of the treatments was high.

Mifepristone-misoprostol is more efficacious and faster than misoprostol alone.

### Early medical abortion before missed menses: A prospective observational study of outcomes of abortion at less than 30 days from last menstrual period [^111HgSF7]. BMJ Sexual & Reproductive Health (2025). Low credibility.

High-sensitivity urine pregnancy tests can detect pregnancy before missed menses. The widespread availability of these tests, alongside improvements in abortion access in many settings, may mean more women present for abortion at a very early stage of pregnancy. We aimed to examine the outcome of early medical abortion (EMA) in pregnancies less than 30 days from the last menstrual period (LMP).

- **Methods**: This study analyzed prospectively collected data on patients at less than 30 days from LMP seeking abortion at a single service in Edinburgh, UK between March 2020 and December 2023. We determined the effectiveness, outcomes of the pregnancy (complete abortion, ongoing pregnancy, incomplete abortion), and serious complications among those seeking EMA at this gestation.

- **Results**: Of 13,565 patients seeking abortion, 78 (0.6%) presented with a self-reported positive home pregnancy test and less than 30 days from LMP. Some 63 out of 78 patients (81%) proceeded to EMA with mifepristone followed by misoprostol. Of this group, 31 out of 63 (49%) had a pre-abortion ultrasound. Complete abortion occurred in 58 out of 63 (92%, 95% CI 82% to 97%) patients, 4 out of 63 (6%) had an ongoing pregnancy, and 1 (1%) had a surgical evacuation for incomplete abortion. There were no serious complications.

- **Conclusions**: Only a very small percentage of patients present for abortion before a missed period. Nevertheless, EMA at this stage is safe and effective. There may be a higher rate of ongoing pregnancy, and so those patients wishing to proceed to EMA should be advised of the importance of confirming success in line with…

### Initiating hormonal contraception [^1177BZYp]. American Family Physician (2021). Low credibility.

Most patients can safely begin using hormonal contraception at any point in their menstrual cycle. An evidence-based, flexible, patient-centered approach to initiating contraception promotes health and enhances patients' reproductive autonomy. A recent Papanicolaou test is not necessary before prescribing hormonal contraception. Most patients can begin using progestin-only contraceptives immediately after childbirth. Patients can start any appropriate contraceptive method immediately after an abortion or early pregnancy loss, except for an intrauterine device following septic abortion. Delaying contraception to wait for the next menses or an appointment creates unnecessary barriers for patients.

Clinicians can facilitate the use of hormonal contraception by providing anticipatory guidance about common side effects, such as spotting and other menstrual cycle changes, giving comprehensive information about available contraceptive choices, honoring patients' preferences, and eliminating office-related barriers. Prescribing or dispensing a one-year supply of contraceptives lowers costs and improves adherence. Counseling via telemedicine or a patient portal eliminates unnecessary office visits.

### Contraceptive effectiveness of immediate compared with delayed insertion of intrauterine devices after abortion: a decision analysis [^117Eg2Mc]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2007). Low credibility.

The study models rates of pregnancy and repeat abortion among women choosing intrauterine contraception after an abortion, comparing scenarios where the intrauterine device (IUD) is inserted immediately after the procedure versus at a follow-up visit.

- **Methods**: We created an evidence-based decision model for women seeking to avoid pregnancy for the 12 months following an abortion. Base case assumptions included pregnancy rates of 0.5% with an IUD versus 20% without, a 1-year IUD continuation rate of 80%, an additional 5% risk of IUD expulsion with immediate insertion, and a 35% risk of not returning for a follow-up visit for IUD insertion. Sensitivity analyses and Monte Carlo simulations were performed.

- **Results**: Immediate IUD insertion post-abortion prevented 52 pregnancies over the following year per 1,000 women based on base case assumptions. Sensitivity analyses reveal that the model is most dependent on the expulsion rate in the immediate-insertion group and the proportion not returning in the delayed-insertion group. Monte Carlo analysis demonstrated that immediate insertion results in fewer pregnancies than delayed insertion in 91% of scenarios, with an absolute mean difference of 28 pregnancies per 1,000 women in the first year after abortion. If 20% of U.S. women undergoing abortion opted for immediate insertion, an estimated 20,000 repeat abortions could be prevented in the first year.

- **Conclusion**: Women who have an IUD inserted immediately after an abortion are expected to experience fewer pregnancies and repeat abortions compared to those scheduled for an IUD insertion at a follow-up visit.

### EnillorRing [^114Nf7tR]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **How to start using EnilloRing**: Consider the possibility of ovulation and conception prior to the first use of EnilloRing.

- **No hormonal contraceptive use in the preceding cycle**: The woman should insert EnilloRing on the first day of her menstrual bleeding. EnilloRing may also be started on Days 2–5 of the woman's cycle, but in this case, a barrier method, such as male condoms with spermicide, should be used for the first seven days of EnilloRing use in the first cycle.

- **Changing from a CHC**: The woman may switch from her previous CHC on any day, but at the latest on the day following the usual hormone-free interval, if she has been using her hormonal method consistently and correctly, or if it is reasonably certain that she is not pregnant.

- **Changing from a progestin-only method (progestin-only pill [POP], implant, injection, or a progestin-releasing intrauterine system [IUS])**: The woman may switch from the POP on any day; instruct her to start using EnilloRing on the day after she took her last POP. She should switch from an implant or the IUS on the day of its removal and from an injectable on the day when the next injection would be due. In all of these cases, the woman should use an additional barrier method, such as a male condom with spermicide, for the first seven days.

### Medical abortion [^111Rmsje]. Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Canada (2016). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for termination of pregnancy, specifically related to medication abortion, the SOGC 2016 guidelines recommend administering a combination of mifepristone (200 mg orally, for one dose) and misoprostol (800 mcg buccal, vaginal, or sublingual, for one dose). This regimen is suggested as the preferred choice for medical abortion within 70 days of the last menstrual period for eligible females.

### How women anticipate coping after an abortion [^115erAQr]. Contraception (2012). Low credibility.

There has been some study of women's emotional and psychological well-being after an abortion, but no research into women's expectations, at the time of seeking an abortion, of how they will cope afterward.

- **Study design**: We abstracted counseling needs assessment forms of 5,109 women who sought an abortion at a clinic in 2008.

- **Results**: The most common emotions that women anticipate feeling after their abortion are relief (63%) and confidence (52%). A significant minority anticipate feeling a little sad (24%) and a little guilty (21%); 3.4% anticipate poor coping. Women with fetal abnormalities, those who do not have high confidence in their decision, women with spiritual concerns about abortion, those with a history of depression, women who feel that they were pushed into having an abortion, and teenagers are more likely to anticipate poor coping post-abortion.

- **Conclusions**: The vast majority of women expect to cope well after their abortion. A small number make the decision to terminate their pregnancies even though they anticipate difficulty coping after the procedure.

### Post-abortion depot medroxyprogesterone acetate continuation rates: A randomized trial of cyclic estradiol [^113RcG2t]. Contraception (2002). Low credibility.

Irregular menstrual bleeding is a common reason for discontinuation of depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) contraception. We conducted a double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled trial to estimate if transdermal estradiol used in a cyclic fashion could make DMPA bleeding patterns more acceptable and improve DMPA continuation rates. Women initiating DMPA contraception immediately post-abortion (N = 132) were randomized to receive either a low sustained dose of transdermal 17-beta estradiol (0.10 mg/day, Climara) or an identical placebo to be used in a cyclic manner for 3 months. Bleeding patterns, contraceptive use, and pregnancy rates were measured for 1 year after enrollment.

Cyclic transdermal estrogen did not create regular bleeding patterns in new users of DMPA and had no effect on DMPA continuation rates (relative hazard = 0.93, 95% CI 0.65–1.33). By 12 months after enrollment, 19.4% of those randomized to estrogen and 23.9% of those randomized to placebo were still using DMPA for contraception. There was no difference in the frequency of DMPA discontinuation primarily for abnormal uterine bleeding between groups (relative risk ratio = 0.95, 95% CI 0.40–2.23). Few women who discontinued DMPA switched to highly effective methods of contraception, and within 1 year of an abortion, there were 18 repeat pregnancies (21.9%).

Compliance with the estrogen patches was poor, resulting in early study termination and inadequate statistical power to detect a clinically significant difference in DMPA continuation rates. Continuation rates of DMPA were low and repeat pregnancy rates were notable.

### Medical methods for first trimester abortion [^1174yyiF]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Surgical abortion up to 63 days by vacuum aspiration or dilatation and curettage has been the method of choice since the 1960s. Medical abortion became an alternative method of first trimester pregnancy termination with the availability of prostaglandins in the early 1970s and anti-progesterones in the 1980s. The most widely researched drugs are prostaglandins (PGs) alone, mifepristone alone, methotrexate alone, mifepristone with prostaglandins, and methotrexate with prostaglandins.

- **Objectives**: To compare different medical methods for first trimester abortion.

- **Search strategy**: The Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, MEDLINE, and Popline were systematically searched. Reference lists of retrieved papers were also examined, and experts in WHO/HRP were contacted.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized controlled trials comparing different medical methods (e.g. single drug, combination), ways of application, or different dose regimens (single or combined) for medical abortion were considered. Trials were assessed and included if they had adequate concealment of allocation, randomization procedure, and follow-up. Participants were women pregnant in the first trimester undergoing medical abortion. Different medical methods used for first trimester abortion, compared with each other or placebo, were included. The outcomes sought include mortality, failure to achieve complete abortion, surgical evacuation (as emergency procedure, non-emergency procedure, or undefined), ongoing pregnancy at follow-up, and time until passing of conceptus (> 3–6 hours).

### Abnormal uterine bleeding associated with hormonal contraception [^116wbyeE]. American Family Physician (2024). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for abnormal uterine bleeding, more specifically with respect to patients on hormonal contraception, AAFP 2024 guidelines recommend counseling patients with levonorgestrel intrauterine devices that most individuals will experience a reduction in bleeding within 12 months.

### Systemic hormonal contraception initiation after abortion: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^113L3a97]. Contraception (2021). High credibility.

- **Hormonal contraception vs. nonhormonal or no contraception**: Five studies compared hormonal contraception with nonhormonal or no contraception following a medical abortion. Four studies reported on abortion success outcomes and found no significant difference in success rates. Three studies focused on bleeding changes. Three studies assessed the initiation of combined oral contraceptives (COC) and two studies assessed multiple methods including the depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA), COC, progestogen-only pill (POP), and progestogen-only implant.

Two fair-quality randomized controlled trials (RCTs) randomized participants to either COCs or placebo and compared rates of abortion success, defined as no need for curettage prior to first menses. Follow-up in both trials occurred at days 15 and 43 after misoprostol. The first RCT enrolled 100 participants with menstrual delay ≤ 21 days in each group, and observed similar rates of abortion success among COC users (98%, 95% CI 93.0–99.8) and placebo (99%, 95% CI 94.6–100.0). The second RCT enrolled 50 participants with menstrual delay ≤ 35 days in each group, and found the abortion success rate among COC users (98%) to be comparable to those taking placebo (92%; CI and p value not reported). In both studies, participants recorded all bleeding and other side effects in diaries and had hemoglobin measurements at days 1 and 15 following mifepristone. The RCT that assessed median blood loss extracted from sanitary pads reported no difference between groups (COC: 69.9 mL, range [4.4–429.6]; placebo: 72.8 mL, range [5.2–855.0]; no p values reported). For self-reported outcomes, neither study reported a difference in these measures.

### Eluryng [^117G9RJr]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Starting eluryng**:

It is important to consider the possibility of ovulation and conception prior to the first use of Eluryng.

- **No hormonal contraceptive use in the preceding cycle**:
	- The woman should insert Eluryng on the first day of her menstrual bleeding. Eluryng may also be started on days 2 to 5 of the woman's cycle; however, a barrier method, such as male condoms with spermicide, should be used for the first seven days of Eluryng use in the first cycle.

- **Changing from a combined hormonal contraceptive (CHC)**:
	- The woman may switch from her previous CHC on any day, but at the latest on the day following the usual hormone-free interval, provided she has been using her hormonal method consistently and correctly, or if it is reasonably certain that she is not pregnant.

- **Changing from a progestin-only method (progestin-only pill [POP], implant, or injection, or a progestin-releasing intrauterine system [IUS])**:
	- The woman may switch from the POP on any day; instruct her to start using Eluryng on the day after she took her last POP. She should switch from an implant or the IUS on the day of its removal, and from an injectable on the day when the next injection would be due. In all of these cases, the woman should use an additional barrier method, such as a male condom with spermicide, for the first seven days.

### Reversal of medication abortion with progesterone: a systematic review [^1111hdfE]. BMJ Sexual & Reproductive Health (2024). Low credibility.

Our review of the use of progesterone to reverse the effect of mifepristone found that ongoing pregnancy rates are not significantly different for individuals treated with progesterone compared with those managed expectantly. Additionally, individuals who do not receive misoprostol after mifepristone may be at increased risk of bleeding.

We found few studies investigating the effect of progesterone treatment to reverse the effects of mifepristone. Only one study was rigorously designed but did not reach its intended sample size due to safety concerns. The remainder were case series with serious ethical and methodological concerns. We compared the ongoing pregnancy rate at 7 weeks or less and 7–8 weeks for individuals treated with progesterone after mifepristone compared with those who were managed expectantly, pooling data from the four studies in this review and the only prior study which examined ongoing pregnancy rates following a 200 mg dose of mifepristone. Even including all the data from the poorly conducted case series, ongoing pregnancy rates are not significantly higher for individuals treated with progesterone compared with those managed expectantly.

Most of the data in this analysis were collected as part of a large case series with ethical and methodological issues. While we considered excluding it from the analysis, we ultimately included it because it did meet our definition of a case series, though its lack of completeness and inclusiveness of cases over time limits its reliability. This case series by Delgado et al. reported a success rate of progesterone treatment.

### Systemic hormonal contraception initiation after abortion: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^116pDMqD]. Contraception (2021). High credibility.

- **Pooled estimates of unadjusted odds ratio for surgery need**: This section includes individuals initiating immediate versus delayed etonogestrel implant insertion following a medical abortion, focusing on the need for surgery to complete the abortion. The denominators are based on intention-to-treat analysis.

- **Pooled estimates of unadjusted odds ratio for additional medical treatment**: This section covers individuals who required additional medical treatment but did not require surgery to complete the abortion. The denominators are also based on intention-to-treat analysis.

One poor-quality randomized controlled trial (RCT) assessed combined oral contraceptive (COC) initiation after medical abortion by randomizing participants at ≤ 63 days gestational age into immediate COC initiation after the abortion success was confirmed (n = 20) versus initiation on the first day of the next menses (n = 20). The study defined abortion success as the need for surgical evacuation due to retained products of conception (POC), assessed at two and six weeks postabortion. There were no cases of incomplete abortion in either group, and no differences in bleeding duration between the groups.

### Expectant management of incomplete abortion in the first trimester [^114FZRdc]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2009). Low credibility.

To evaluate the effectiveness and acceptability of expectant management of induced and spontaneous first trimester incomplete abortion, a prospective observational trial was conducted between June 2006 and November 2007. The study involved two groups of patients diagnosed with an incomplete abortion: 66 patients who had received misoprostol for an induced abortion (group 1) and 30 patients who experienced a spontaneous abortion (group 2). Transvaginal ultrasound was performed weekly.

The success rate, defined as complete abortion without surgery, was recorded along with the time to resolution, duration of bleeding and pelvic pain, rate of infection, number of unscheduled hospital visits, and level of satisfaction with expectant management.

- **Results**: The incidence of complete abortion was 86.4% and 82.1% in groups 1 and 2 respectively at day 14 after diagnosis, reaching 100% in both groups by day 30 (two group 2 patients underwent curettage and were excluded from the analysis). Both groups reported 100% satisfaction with expectant management, although over 90% of the women reported feeling anxious.

- **Conclusion**: Expectant management for incomplete abortion in the first trimester, after the use of misoprostol or following spontaneous abortion, may be practical and feasible. However, it may increase anxiety associated with the impending abortion.

### The effects of a postmiscarriage menstrual period prior to reconceiving [^115x2dYQ]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). High credibility.

The optimal interpregnancy interval following a single pregnancy loss is controversial. It is common obstetrical practice to recommend that women who have had a miscarriage in the first trimester of pregnancy should wait for one or more menstrual cycles before attempting to conceive again.

- **Objective**: This study aimed to assess whether conception before the first menstrual period following a spontaneous pregnancy loss is associated with a risk of repeat miscarriage or adverse perinatal outcomes.

- **Study design**: This retrospective cohort study included 107 women who had a spontaneous miscarriage in the first trimester of pregnancy followed by a subsequent pregnancy with an interpregnancy interval of less than 12 weeks. All miscarriages had ended in either spontaneous expulsion of the products of conception or through medical or surgical evacuation of the uterus. The perinatal outcome measures of 57 women who conceived after the first menstrual period following a spontaneous miscarriage were compared with perinatal outcome measures of 50 women who conceived before the first menstrual period following a spontaneous miscarriage. The primary outcome was the rate of pregnancy loss, and the secondary outcomes were gestational age at delivery and birthweight.

- **Results**: The rate of repeat miscarriage was 10.4% for women who conceived before the first menstrual period following a spontaneous miscarriage and 15.8% for those who conceived after (P = 0.604). There were no differences in the gestational age at delivery (38.9 vs. 38.7 weeks; p = 0.66) or the birthweight (3347 ± 173 vs. 3412 ± 156 g; p = 0.5) between the two groups.

### EnilloRing [^116eEkoj]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The woman may start using EnilloRing within the first five days following a complete first trimester abortion or miscarriage, and she does not need to use an additional method of contraception. If the use of EnilloRing is not started within five days following a first trimester abortion or miscarriage, the woman should follow the instructions for "No Hormonal Contraceptive Use in the Preceding Cycle". In the meantime, she should be advised to use a non-hormonal contraceptive method.

Start EnilloRing no earlier than four weeks following a second trimester abortion or miscarriage due to the increased risk of thromboembolism [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Following childbirth: The use of EnilloRing may be initiated no sooner than four weeks postpartum in women who elect not to breastfeed due to the increased risk of thromboembolism in the postpartum period [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Advise women who are breastfeeding not to use EnilloRing but to use other forms of contraception until the child is weaned.

If a woman begins using EnilloRing postpartum, instruct her to use an additional method of contraception, such as male condoms with spermicide, for the first seven days. If she has not yet had a period, consider the possibility of ovulation and conception occurring prior to the initiation of EnilloRing.

### Reversal of medication abortion with progesterone: a systematic review [^116iX3rw]. BMJ Sexual & Reproductive Health (2024). Low credibility.

- **Characteristics and pregnancy outcomes**: The second study was a case series of three patients selected among women who contacted an Australian pregnancy support service via the internet and received a 2-week vaginal progesterone course for abortion reversal. The timing of progesterone initiation varied. Pregnancy outcomes were assessed via ultrasound at varying time points and/or patient history. The study did not report on any of our predetermined secondary outcomes.

- **Case series of multiple countries**: The third study was a larger case series of patients selected among women from "several different countries" who called a hotline for abortion reversal. A total of 325 different healthcare providers treated them with various progesterone regimens. The maximum interval between mifepristone and initiation of progesterone was 72 hours. Out of 1668 women who called the hotline expressing interest in progesterone, only 754 initiated progesterone therapy. It is unclear why the remaining 954 did not initiate therapy. The authors excluded an additional 207 out of 754 women from the analysis because they later chose to complete the abortion, were over 72 hours after taking mifepristone, or were lost to follow-up.

Pregnancy outcomes were available for 547 women and were assessed via patient history. It appears that gestational cardiac activity was documented prior to initiation of progesterone treatment in some cases and not others. The study did not report on any of our predetermined secondary outcomes.

### Intrauterine device insertion after medical abortion [^116gK1zy]. Contraception (2011). Low credibility.

Studies comparing immediate intrauterine device (IUD) insertion after first-trimester surgical abortion with interval insertion show similar efficacy and expulsion rates. However, women randomized to interval insertion of an IUD are less likely to return for device placement. An ideal time to insert intrauterine contraception may be the day a woman presents for verification of a completed medical abortion. We examined immediate insertion of IUDs after completed first-trimester medical abortion.

- **Study design**: This is a prospective, observational clinical study to determine expulsion rates of intrauterine contraception placed immediately after confirmed, completed first-trimester medical abortion.

- **Results**: Of 118 subjects, 78 women had levonorgestrel IUDs placed, whereas 41 women received copper IUDs. Of 97 subjects who completed the study, there were 4 clinical expulsions (4.1%) during 3 months of follow-up. There were no diagnosed pelvic infections, pregnancies, or uterine perforations. The continuation rate at 3 months was 80%.

- **Conclusion**: Intrauterine devices inserted at the time of completed, confirmed first-trimester medical abortion have low rates of expulsion.

### Can women determine the success of early medical termination of pregnancy themselves [^115sRCkR]. Contraception (2015). Low credibility.

To determine the outcome of early medical termination of pregnancy (TOP) among women who choose a "self-assessment" follow-up, a self-performed low sensitivity urine pregnancy test with instructions on signs or symptoms that mandate contacting the TOP service was used.

- **Study design**: A retrospective review of computer databases of 1726 women choosing self-assessment after early medical TOP (< 9 weeks) in the UK. The main outcome measures were (a) number of women choosing self-assessment, (b) contact rates with the TOP service, and (c) time to presentation with an ongoing pregnancy (failed TOP).

- **Results**: Ninety-six percent of women having an early medical TOP and going home to expel the pregnancy chose self-assessment. Two percent of women made unscheduled visits to the TOP service. One hundred and eighty-eight women (11%) telephoned the service about concerns related to complications or the success of treatment. There were eight ongoing pregnancies (0.5%; 95% confidence interval 0.2–0.9%). Four were detected within 4 weeks of treatment; the remainder were not detected until one or more missed menses after the procedure.

- **Conclusions**: Most women having an early medical TOP, who go home to expel the pregnancy, choose self-assessment. Relatively few women make unscheduled visits or telephone the TOP service. Most ongoing pregnancies are recognized at an early stage, although late presentation (as with all methods of follow-up) does still occur.

- **Implications statement**: If women are given clear instructions on how and when to conduct a urine pregnancy test and on signs or symptoms that require action, self-assessment can be an effective follow-up method.

### Defining the curve when initial levels of human chorionic gonadotropin in patients with spontaneous abortions are low [^111Zz3sz]. Fertility and Sterility (2006). High credibility.

Because lower initial hCG concentrations are associated with slower rates of decline in spontaneous abortions, the aim of this study was to provide a detailed description of the expected rates of hCG decline in patients presenting with very low initial hCG levels and who ultimately were confirmed to have spontaneous abortions. When initial levels lie between 50 and 500 mIU/mL, the slowest expected percentage decline ranges from 12% to 24% in 2 days and from 34% to 68% in 7 days.

### Mifepristone and misoprostol for early pregnancy loss and medication abortion [^1114LoB6]. American Family Physician (2021). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for termination of pregnancy, specifically with respect to medication abortion, regimens according to AAFP 2021 guidelines recommend administering a second dose of misoprostol four hours after the first. This approach is suggested to increase the effectiveness of medication abortion at 71 to 77 days' gestation and is also considered for administration at 64 to 70 days' gestation.

### Medication abortion up to 70 days of gestation: ACOG Practice Bulletin, Number 225 [^113vGpK7]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for termination of pregnancy, specifically with respect to the management of ongoing pregnancy, ACOG 2020 guidelines recommend considering the administration of a repeat dose of misoprostol or performing uterine aspiration. This decision should depend on the clinical circumstances and patient preferences in cases of ongoing pregnancy after medication abortion.

### Ovulation resumption after medical abortion with mifepristone and misoprostol [^114rJKro]. Contraception (2011). Low credibility.

Mifepristone, as an antiprogestin, may influence the return to ovulation beyond its abortifacient activity. This study aimed to measure the time-to-ovulation in women who received 200 mg of mifepristone orally and 800 mcg of misoprostol vaginally for abortion up to 63 days of gestation.

- **Study design**: This planned substudy was part of a multicenter randomized trial of 200 mg mifepristone followed immediately or 24 hours later by 800 mcg vaginal misoprostol. Women with successful expulsion of the gestational sac, based on ultrasound examination one week after mifepristone treatment, were enrolled. All subjects used nonhormonal contraception until study completion. Baseline serum progesterone (P) levels were drawn on day 8 ± 1 after mifepristone administration and then measured twice weekly until the P level exceeded 3 ng/mL, indicative of ovulation. The mean time-to-ovulation was calculated using interval-censored regression to account for participant discontinuation.

- **Results**: Fourteen (52%) of the 27 enrolled women completed the substudy. The longest follow-up period for a participant who did not complete the study was 29 days. Ovulation occurred 20.6 ± 5.1 days (range 8–36) after mifepristone administration. Time-to-ovulation was not influenced by participant age, gestational age, study arm, body mass index, or the presence of human chorionic gonadotropin.

- **Conclusions**: The return to ovulation following medical abortion with mifepristone and misoprostol occurs on average three weeks post-abortion. The administration of 200 mg mifepristone does not affect this timeframe.

### Society of family planning clinical recommendation: Management of hemorrhage at the time of abortion [^1146mre3]. Contraception (2024). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for termination of pregnancy, more specifically with respect to the management of post-abortion bleeding, the SFP 2024 guidelines recommend performing uterine artery embolization prior to more invasive measures, such as laparotomy and hysterectomy, in settings where it is available due to its association with less morbidity and mortality.

### Systemic hormonal contraception initiation after abortion: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^112hQXnn]. Contraception (2021). Low credibility.

Two fair-quality RCTs and one poor-quality prospective cohort study assessed etonorgestrel implants and found no significant difference in abortion success rates, rates of surgery required to complete the abortion, or rates of additional treatment. All three studies defined abortion success as not needing surgical evacuation. In a noninferiority RCT with a design similar to the DMPA trial, the etonorgestrel implant insertion occurred on the same day as mifepristone (n = 236) or after the abortion (n = 240). Investigators assessed abortion success by UPT and/or ultrasound. The study included participants eligible for outpatient medical abortion; approximately 14% to 18% of included participants had a gestational age greater than 64 days. There were no differences between the immediate and delayed initiation groups in the proportion needing surgery to complete abortion (risk difference 0.08%, 90% CI −3.1 to 3.3), the proportion needing any additional treatment (risk difference −1.9%, 90% CI −6.7 to 2.8), or the proportion of ongoing pregnancies (risk difference 0.02%, 90% CI −1.8 to 1.9). Those in the immediate etonorgestrel implant group exhibited a median of 12 days of bleeding after the abortion compared with 10 days for the delayed implant group (p = 0.03) but no difference in self-reported bleeding heavier than menses (68% vs. 68%, p = 0.91).

A second RCT compared 277 participants at ≤ 63 days gestational age with an etonorgestrel implant inserted within one hour of mifepristone with 261 participants with insertion at 2 to 4 weeks after mifepristone. The study demonstrated equivalent outcomes between the two groups in terms of primary and secondary measures of abortion success.

If any of these side effects bother you, call your doctor or healthcare provider.

- **General precautions**:

- **Missed periods and use of oral contraceptives before or during early pregnancy**: There may be times when you may not menstruate regularly after you have completed taking a cycle of pills. If you have taken your pills regularly and miss one menstrual period, continue taking your pills for the next cycle, but be sure to inform your healthcare provider before doing so. If you have not taken the pills daily as instructed and missed a menstrual period, or if you missed two consecutive menstrual periods, you may be pregnant. Check with your healthcare provider immediately to determine whether you are pregnant. Do not continue to take oral contraceptives until you are sure you are not pregnant, but continue to use another method of contraception.

	- There is no conclusive evidence that oral contraceptive use is associated with an increase in birth defects when taken inadvertently during early pregnancy. Previously, a few studies had reported that oral contraceptives might be associated with birth defects, but these studies have not been confirmed. Nevertheless, oral contraceptives or any other drugs should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary and prescribed by your doctor. You should check with your doctor about risks to your unborn child of any medication taken during pregnancy.

- **While breastfeeding**: If you are breastfeeding, consult your doctor before starting oral contraceptives, as some of the drug will be passed on to the child in the milk. A few adverse effects have been noted.

### Clinical practice guideline for abnormal uterine bleeding: Hysterectomy versus alternative therapy [^116h5AGe]. Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology (2011). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for abnormal uterine bleeding, specifically concerning general principles, the SGS 2012 guidelines recommend considering any of the following treatment options in patients with AUB presumed to be caused by predominantly ovulatory disorders or endometrial hemostatic disorders. The choice of treatment should be based on the patient's values and preferences:

- **Hysterectomy**: A surgical procedure to remove the uterus.

- **Endometrial ablation**: A procedure to destroy the lining of the uterus.

- **Systemically administered medical therapies**: These include medications administered orally or by injection that affect the entire body.

- **Levonorgestrel intrauterine system**: A device placed inside the uterus that releases hormone levonorgestrel to manage symptoms.

### Abnormal uterine bleeding associated with hormonal contraception [^115yCMEt]. American Family Physician (2024). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for abnormal uterine bleeding, particularly in patients using hormonal contraception, the AAFP 2024 guidelines recommend introducing a short (4–5-day) hormone-free interval for patients experiencing abnormal uterine bleeding with the continuous use of combined hormonal contraception.

### Incidence of pregnancy after expectant, medical, or surgical management of spontaneous first trimester miscarriage: Long-term follow-up of miscarriage treatment (MIST) randomised controlled trial [^1135NNmD]. BMJ (2009). High credibility.

Of the 1,199 women recruited to the original trial, we sent questionnaires to 1,128 women and their general practitioners. For the 71 remaining, we had no consent from the patient or her original general practitioner for such follow-up. Questionnaires providing subsequent pregnancy details were returned for 762 women (a 68% response rate), from the woman herself, her general practitioner, or both.

With data recorded as part of the original MIST trial protocol, table 1 compares respondents to this follow-up survey with non-respondents (including the 71 not sent a questionnaire as well as those not returning questionnaires). The respondents were broadly representative of the MIST trial population, with no significant differences between respondents and non-respondents.

Among the survey respondents, 634 out of 758 (84%, 95% confidence interval 81% to 86%) reported a subsequent pregnancy since the index miscarriage, with 565 out of 689 (82%, 79% to 85%) having a live birth. The time to subsequently giving birth was similar in the three randomized groups (fig 1; P = 0.41). Five years after the index miscarriage, 177 out of 224 (79%, 73% to 84%) of those who had been randomized to expectant management had given birth, compared with 181 out of 230 (79%, 73% to 84%) in the medical group and 192 out of 235 (82%).

### Medical abortion [^116dq8nw]. Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Canada (2016). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for the termination of pregnancy, specifically with respect to follow-up assessment, the SOGC 2016 guidelines recommend obtaining an ultrasound and/or serial β-hCG measurements combined with clinical history to follow up on females after abortion, either in-clinic or remotely.

### Enpresse [^114JLUKK]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

If any of these side effects bother you, call your doctor or healthcare provider.

- **General precautions**:

1. Missed periods and use of oral contraceptives before or during early pregnancy - There may be times when you do not menstruate regularly after completing a cycle of pills. If you have taken your pills regularly and miss one menstrual period, continue taking your pills for the next cycle but be sure to inform your healthcare provider beforehand. If you have not taken the pills daily as instructed and missed a menstrual period, or if you missed two consecutive menstrual periods, you may be pregnant. Check with your healthcare provider immediately to determine whether you are pregnant. Do not continue to take oral contraceptives until you are sure you are not pregnant, but continue to use another method of contraception.

There is no conclusive evidence that oral-contraceptive use is associated with an increase in birth defects when taken inadvertently during early pregnancy. Previously, a few studies had reported that oral contraceptives might be associated with birth defects, but these studies have not been confirmed. Nevertheless, oral contraceptives or any other drugs should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary and prescribed by your doctor. You should check with your doctor about risks to your unborn child of any medication taken during pregnancy.

### Fast-track vs. delayed insertion of the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system after early medical abortion - a randomized trial [^111YBwfm]. Contraception (2017). Low credibility.

To compare levonorgestrel (LNG) 52-mg intrauterine system (IUS) expulsion rates with fast-track (≤ 3 days) or delayed (2–4 weeks) insertion following mifepristone and misoprostol medical abortion, we conducted a pilot trial.

In this study, we randomized 108 women at ≤ 63 days' gestation to either fast-track (n = 55) or delayed (n = 53) insertion. Follow-up visits occurred at 2–4 weeks, 3 months, and 1 year. We assessed total and partial expulsion at 3 months and 1 year, as well as adverse effects and bleeding profiles.

We had follow-up data at 3 months and 1 year for 41 (74.5%) and 37 (69.8%) women in the fast-track group and 31 (56.4%) and 28 (52.8%) women in the delayed group. By 3 months, expulsion occurred in six (12.5%) women after fast-track and one (2.3%) woman after delayed insertion [risk ratio (RR) 5.50, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.69–43.90]; most (n = 5) of these were partial expulsions in the fast-track group. By 1 year, expulsion had occurred in seven (14.6%) and five (11.5%) women in the fast-track and delayed groups, respectively (RR 1.28, 95% CI 0.44–3.75). We found no differences in rates of vacuum aspiration, residual tissue, infection, or bleeding patterns within 3 months of insertion.

In conclusion, fast-track insertion of the LNG 52-mg IUS after medical abortion is feasible but may result in higher expulsion rates compared to delayed insertion. Due to lack of statistical power and high lost-to-follow-up rates, we were unable to fully address this question.

### Sublingual misoprostol versus standard surgical care for treatment of incomplete abortion in five sub-Saharan African countries [^114aQHzf]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2012). Low credibility.

Participants were asked to return to the clinic 1 week later to confirm clinical status. In the event of continued heavy bleeding, an enlarged uterus, or any suspicion of an ectopic pregnancy, the woman was referred for ultrasound and follow-up care. If continued incomplete abortion was determined by clinical exam or by ultrasound in either of the study arms, women were given the option of an immediate surgical evacuation or returning for additional follow-up 1 week later to see if expulsion had occurred spontaneously. If, after the second follow-up visit, abortion was not complete, a surgical completion was performed.

All women were advised that they could return to the study site at any time if complications arose or if they had questions. Care throughout the study was provided by clinicians at all levels. In all sites except Mauritania and Nigeria, care was provided by midwives or nurses. In both these sites, care was mostly given by physicians, although nurses and midwives were involved in counseling and follow-up. Only some clinicians at the Burkina Faso sites had previous experience with misoprostol for treatment of incomplete abortion.

A sample size of 390 (195 per arm) was needed to detect a 5% one-sided difference between surgical (assumed to be 98% effective) and sublingual misoprostol with a 95% confidence interval and 80% power. Data on demographics, method outcome, side effects, and women's satisfaction with the treatment were combined from the 6 sites and analyzed using relative risk, chi-square, and independent t-tests as appropriate.

### Cervical preparation for second-trimester surgical abortion prior to 20 weeks' gestation: SFP guideline #2013–4 [^116Vy2Wo]. Contraception (2014). High credibility.

Regarding surgical interventions for termination of pregnancy, particularly surgical abortion (cervical preparation), the SFP 2014 guidelines recommend placing osmotic dilators overnight after 18 weeks of gestation. Consider performing same-day procedures by highly experienced dilation and evacuation providers at later gestations. These procedures should utilize a combination of osmotic and pharmacologic agents or serial doses of misoprostol to meet the time constraints of patients and personnel.

### Insights from an expert group meeting on the definition and measurement of unsafe abortion [^1164E69r]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2016). Low credibility.

A reasonable approach, therefore, would be to consider all abortions that do not comply with WHO guidelines as unsafe, and to further differentiate unsafe abortions according to their outcome. It should also be recognized that complications can range from mild (e.g. prolonged mild bleeding) to severe (e.g. sepsis or damage to internal organs). Abortions that result in severe complications or death would be the most unsafe procedures.

All medical procedures carry some risk, but when performed under proper conditions by skilled providers using correct medical techniques and drugs, induced abortion presents minimal risk to a woman's physical health. The meeting participants noted, however, that procedures performed according to recommended guidelines can carry additional risks (including nonmedical risks) when they are highly restricted by law or highly stigmatized. In such contexts, women might delay seeking care and obtain an abortion at a fairly late stage and under stressful conditions, thereby increasing the risk of physical or psychological complications.

Furthermore, they might not receive information or counseling, including family planning counseling. The quality of a woman's relationships and the strength of her social support network might be compromised, either because she shared the fact of her abortion or because she refrained from sharing it with loved ones. Thus, a gradient of safety exists even among abortions that comply with guidelines.

Use of medical abortion is an important and new consideration with respect to the classification of abortions.

### Contraceptive care at the time of medical abortion: Experiences of women and health professionals in a hospital or community sexual and reproductive health context [^117AtNut]. Contraception (2016). Low credibility.

The participating sites use a medical abortion regimen (when gestation ≤ 9 weeks) of oral mifepristone 200 mg, which is provided (if appropriate) at the end of an initial assessment appointment. During this appointment, women receive verbal counselling and written information on their abortion and contraceptive options from an assessing doctor or nurse. A second appointment occurs 24–48 hours later, during which women receive misoprostol 800 mcg vaginally. Women requesting the contraceptive implant, injectable, or user-controlled methods are provided with these at the misoprostol appointment. Women who have not agreed to a method or changed their mind by the misoprostol appointment are given further counselling prior to treatment.

A 'fast-track' service is available from the SRHC, allowing women at each site to have an intrauterine method fitted one week after medical abortion. The majority of women attending the research sites now return home to pass the pregnancy following the administration of misoprostol, as British abortion law mandates that abortion medication must be administered on licensed premises. The standard follow-up for medical abortion at these sites is a self-performed low-sensitivity urine pregnancy test at two weeks, meaning that women do not routinely return to the clinics following treatment.

- **Data collection**: We conducted individual semistructured interviews with health professionals and women using a flexible topic guide. The health professional topic guide addressed areas including participants' role in abortion care and work satisfaction.

### Mifepristone: Where do we come from and where are we going? Clinical development over a quarter of a century [^115a59G1]. Contraception (2010). Low credibility.

The administration of mifepristone followed by the prostaglandin, misoprostol, has been used successfully in the medical termination of pregnancy for over 25 years, and the method is registered in 35 countries. Single doses of mifepristone are also effective as an emergency postcoital contraceptive. When administered for 3 months or longer to women with uterine leiomyomas, mifepristone is associated with a reduction in pain and bleeding, an improvement in quality of life, and a decrease in fibroid size. Mifepristone is also effective in decreasing pain in women with endometriosis. In both these conditions, serum estradiol levels are in the range of those in the early follicular phase.

A daily dose of at least 2 mg of mifepristone blocks ovulation. In contrast, weekly administration of 25 or 50 mg does not consistently block ovulation but has contraceptive potential by delaying endometrial development. Mifepristone, in a dose of 200 mg, administered 48 hours after the Luteinizing Hormone (LH) surge also acts as a contraceptive. However, this strategy is not practical for widespread use. Administration of mifepristone for 4–6 months or longer may lead to endometrial thickening. Endometrial histology reveals cystic glandular dilation together with admixed estrogen (mitotic) and progestin (secretory) epithelial effects. This histological pattern does not represent endometrial hyperplasia.

### Ru ok? The acceptability and feasibility of remote technologies for follow-up after early medical abortion [^112aRnX5]. Contraception (2014). Low credibility.

We tested the effectiveness and feasibility of remote communication technologies to increase follow-up after early medical abortion.

- **Study design**: Women (n = 999) were randomized to 'remote' follow-up incorporating a low-sensitivity pregnancy test and a standardized symptom questionnaire administered online, by text message, or telephone by a non-clinical call center operator two weeks after treatment, or to 'clinic-based' follow-up with ultrasound at one week. Women in the clinic-based group who could not return performed a high-sensitivity pregnancy test at three weeks and had a telephone call with clinic staff. The primary outcome was completion of follow-up. Rates of complications, acceptability, and preferences were compared.

- **Results**: The overall follow-up rate did not differ by group [clinic-based, 73% vs. remote, 69%; risk ratio (RR) 1.0 (95% confidence interval 0.9–1.2)]. In the clinic-based group, 83% did not return for an ultrasound scan and were followed up by phone. In the remote group, follow-up by phone or text was more successful than online (text: 75.4%; phone: 73.7%; online: 46.5%, p < 0.001). The proportion of women receiving additional care was 9% in the clinic-based group and 4% in the remote group [RR 1.8 (95% CI 1.1–3.1)]. Most women found their follow-up method acceptable but would prefer follow-up by phone or text message if needed in future.

- **Conclusions**: Follow-up after medical abortion using remote communication is feasible and, for most women, preferable to a clinic visit.

### Contraceptive failure related to estimated cycle day of conception relative to the start of the last bleeding episode [^111ge72v]. Contraception (2009). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to estimate the menstrual cycle day of conception in women presenting for abortion.

- **Study design**: This was a retrospective chart survey in two urban free-standing abortion clinics.

- **Results**: There were 913 charts reviewed of women presenting for an abortion at less than 63 days' gestation, as determined by endovaginal ultrasound, who were "sure" of the date of their last normal menstrual period. The estimated mean cycle day of conception, determined by sonographically estimating the length of gestation, was 14.6. Of the 99 women using cyclic hormonal contraception, 26 (26.3%) conceived before 10 days after the onset of withdrawal bleeding compared to 100 (14.7%) of 679 who conceived before 10 days after the onset of their last menstrual period while using all other forms of contraception, including "none" (p = .005). No other differences in the proportions conceiving early in the cycle were observed with respect to age, ethnicity, or obesity.

- **Conclusion**: These data suggest that there is a sizable subset of women who ovulate earlier after the onset of withdrawal bleeding when using 21/7 hormonal contraceptives than after the onset of menses when not using hormonal contraception. It is possible that women using hormonal contraceptives may have a higher risk of pregnancy if they ovulate sooner after the onset of bleeding.

### Medical abortion [^111MqGyW]. Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Canada (2016). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for the termination of pregnancy, with specific emphasis on post-abortion contraception, the SOGC 2016 guidelines recommend that hormonal contraception should be initiated, if desired by the patient, as soon as possible after taking misoprostol.

### Reaching women where they are: Eliminating the initial in-person medical abortion visit [^114Xas5k]. Contraception (2015). Low credibility.

The requirement that every woman desiring a medical abortion must come in person to a clinical facility to obtain the drugs is a substantial barrier for many women. To eliminate this requirement in the United States, two key components of the standard initial visit would need to be restructured.

- **Alternatives to ultrasound and pelvic exam**: These need to be identified to ensure that gestational age is within the limit for safe and effective treatment. This is probably feasible; for example, data from a large study suggest that in selected patients, menstrual history is highly sensitive for this purpose.

- **Removal of restrictions on mifepristone distribution**: The Food and Drug Administration would need to remove the medically unwarranted restriction on distribution of mifepristone.

These two changes could allow provision of the service by a broader range of providers in nontraditional venues or even by telemedicine. Such options could have profound benefits in reducing cost and expanding access to abortion.

### Vaginal misoprostol administered 1, 2, or 3 days after mifepristone for early medical abortion: A randomized trial [^1144PU2a]. JAMA (2000). High credibility.

The conventional timing of misoprostol administration after mifepristone for medical abortion is 2 days; however, more flexible intervals that may make the regimen more convenient have not been studied. This study aimed to determine whether administering vaginal misoprostol 1, 2, or 3 days after mifepristone influences the safety or effectiveness of abortion at up to 56 days' gestation.

A prospective, randomized, open-label trial was conducted from March 1998 to June 1999. The study was held across sixteen US primary care and referral abortion facilities. A total of 2295 healthy patients, aged 18 years or older and up to 56 days pregnant, participated. Forty participants (1.7%) were lost to follow-up.

- **Interventions**: Patients received 200 mg of oral mifepristone and were randomly assigned to self-administer 800 microg of vaginal misoprostol at home 1 (n = 745), 2 (n = 778), or 3 (n = 772) days later. Women returned to the clinic up to 8 days after mifepristone for ultrasonographic evaluation. A second dose of misoprostol was administered if the abortion was not complete. Patients with continuing pregnancy, excessive bleeding, or retained pregnancy tissue 5 weeks later received an aspiration curettage.

- **Main outcome measures**: The effectiveness of the procedure, defined as a complete medical abortion without surgical intervention, was assessed. Adverse effects, acceptability of the procedure based on patient questionnaires, reasons for surgical intervention, and adverse outcomes were compared among the study groups.

Of the 2255 women completing follow-up, complete medical abortion rates were 98% (95% confidence interval

### Daysee [^116etubQ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Start on the Sunday after the patient's next period begins. Use additional non-hormonal contraception, such as condoms and spermicide, until the patient has taken a light blue tablet for seven consecutive days.

- **Starting Daysee after abortion or miscarriage**:
	- **First-trimester**: Daysee may be started on the Sunday after an abortion or miscarriage. The patient must use additional non-hormonal contraception, such as condoms and spermicide, until the patient has taken a light blue tablet for seven consecutive days.
	- **Second-trimester**: Do not start until four weeks following a second-trimester abortion or miscarriage, due to the increased risk of thromboembolic disease. Begin contraceptive therapy with Daysee following the instructions for women not currently using hormonal contraception. Use additional non-hormonal contraception, such as condoms and spermicide, until the patient has taken a light blue tablet for seven consecutive days [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

- **Starting Daysee after childbirth**:
	- Do not start until four weeks after delivery, owing to the increased risk of thromboembolic disease. Initiate contraceptive therapy with Daysee following the same guidelines as for women not currently using hormonal contraception. Additional non-hormonal contraception, such as condoms and spermicide, should be used until the patient has taken a light blue tablet for seven consecutive days [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

If the woman has not yet had a menstrual period postpartum, consider the possibility of ovulation and conception occurring prior to the use of Daysee [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

### Does a short luteal phase correlate with an increased risk of miscarriage? A cohort study [^116sdGGn]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Low credibility.

Since miscarriage is the most common adverse event in early pregnancy and is associated with significant physical and psychological morbidity, it is crucial to identify women who may be at increased risk. This study was designed to assess whether a short luteal phase, as reflected in cycle charting, is correlated with an increased risk of miscarriage. However, the results did not support an association.

Further research with larger sample sizes is required to determine if a short luteal phase, or other indicators of luteal phase deficiency such as premenstrual spotting, is associated with early pregnancy losses before 20 weeks among preconception cohorts. This research should include daily tracking of menstrual cycle parameters, in addition to monitoring progesterone and human chorionic gonadotropin levels.

### Effect of "observed start" vs. traditional "Sunday start" on hormonal contraceptive continuation rates after medical abortion [^112bRdQk]. Contraception (2008). Low credibility.

This study was conducted to determine whether early initiation of combined hormonal contraception under direct clinical observation following successful medical abortion increases continuation rates with the method compared to the traditional "Sunday start".

- **Study design**: Women enrolled in a multicenter medical abortion trial with mifepristone and misoprostol who requested combined hormonal contraception (pill, ring, or patch) following medical abortion were recruited. Women were randomized to initiate the method under supervision either at the 1-week medical abortion follow-up visit ("observed start") or at the first Sunday following this visit ("Sunday start"). The primary outcome was the continuation of the chosen method at 6 weeks.

- **Results**: Of the 1128 women in the primary trial, 261 subjects enrolled in this substudy and 36/261 (13.8%) were lost to follow-up. There was no significant difference in method continuation at 6 weeks [observed start 108/114 (94.7%), Sunday start 101/111 (91.0%, p = .27)].

- **Conclusion**: Short-term continuation rates among those choosing hormonal contraception following medical abortion are high and are not significantly improved by initiating the method at the time of the first follow-up visit.
