## Question

Treatment for acute otitis media after initial augmentin therapy

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about treatment for acute otitis media after initial Augmentin (amoxicillin-clavulanate) therapy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to define treatment failure and the timing of reassessment. Then, I should verify the likely pathogens and resistance patterns that drive second-line choices. Next, I will review guideline-supported second-line options and dosing, including ceftriaxone, clindamycin, and tympanocentesis. After that, I need to consider duration of therapy and whether to extend or switch. Finally, I should confirm safety, follow-up, and special scenarios like penicillin allergy or persistent effusion, and synthesize a practical algorithm with supporting evidence.

> Let me first confirm the definition of treatment failure and the timing of reassessment. Clinical improvement should be evident within 48 to 72 hours of starting antibiotics; if symptoms persist or worsen, I should reassess the diagnosis, adherence, and consider changing therapy, ideally after confirming the AOM diagnosis and excluding mimics or complications [^c25ae103] [^d9844476] [^8072bae3].

> Wait, let me verify the likely pathogens and resistance patterns after failure of amoxicillin-clavulanate. The predominant bacteria remain Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis; after failure of a beta-lactam agent, concern rises for beta-lactamase–producing H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis, and for pneumococcal strains with higher penicillin MICs, which is why second-line regimens need broader or different coverage [^19adbd18] [^5374ea0f].

> I will now examine guideline-supported second-line options. The AAP/AAFP guideline recommends either high-dose amoxicillin-clavulanate at 90 mg/kg/day of the amoxicillin component with 6.4 mg/kg/day of clavulanate in 2 divided doses (14:1 ratio) for 10 days, or intramuscular ceftriaxone at 50 mg/kg once daily for 1 or 3 days, noting that a 3-day ceftriaxone course outperforms 1 day in nonresponders; alternatives include clindamycin 30–40 mg/kg/day in 3 divided doses, with or without a third-generation cephalosporin, and tympanocentesis with specialist input for refractory cases [^8072bae3] [^c25ae103].

> Hold on, I should verify dosing nuances and formulation choices. The high-dose amoxicillin-clavulanate 14:1 ratio minimizes clavulanate-related gastrointestinal adverse effects while maximizing amoxicillin exposure; twice-daily administration improves adherence compared with three times daily, and clinical trials support comparable efficacy between 45/6.4 mg/kg/day divided every 12 hours and 40/10 mg/kg/day divided every 8 hours, though the 14:1 ratio is preferred for tolerability in retreatment scenarios [^d1aa2e50] [^50ec338d].

> Let me consider ceftriaxone more carefully. For children who failed oral therapy or cannot take oral medications, ceftriaxone 50 mg/kg IM/IV daily for 1–3 days is recommended, with evidence suggesting better outcomes with a 3-day course in persistent cases; this approach bypasses adherence issues and provides reliable parenteral coverage against resistant pneumococcus and beta-lactamase producers [^8072bae3] [^c25ae103].

> But wait, what if there is a true penicillin allergy or severe intolerance. In that case, I should avoid beta-lactams and consider clindamycin 30–40 mg/kg/day in 3 divided doses, recognizing that clindamycin has excellent activity against pneumococcus but limited activity against H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis; adding a third-generation cephalosporin such as cefdinir or cefpodoxime can broaden coverage when beta-lactam allergy is not type I, though I need to confirm allergy phenotype before choosing this path [^8072bae3] [^9f85accb].

> I should double-check the role of tympanocentesis. For children with persistent symptoms after multiple antibiotic courses, tympanocentesis for culture and susceptibility testing is reasonable to guide targeted therapy and to decompress the middle ear; this is particularly useful in recurrent or refractory AOM and aligns with pediatric infectious disease principles [^8072bae3] [^1656a28d].

> Next, I should review duration of therapy. For children under 2 years or with severe symptoms, a 10-day course is recommended; for children 2–5 years with mild to moderate disease, 7 days is acceptable; and for children 6 years and older with mild to moderate disease, 5–7 days suffices; importantly, if using ceftriaxone, 1–3 days is guideline-supported, with 3 days favored in nonresponders [^51652fc0] [^8072bae3].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought to extend amoxicillin-clavulanate to 14 days after failure, but I should correct that. Extending beyond 10 days is not routinely recommended; instead, if there is no improvement by 48–72 hours, I should switch agents or escalate rather than simply prolong the failing regimen, unless there are special circumstances such as concurrent mastoiditis where longer therapy is indicated [^51652fc0] [^c25ae103].

> I need to ensure supportive care and follow-up are addressed. Adequate analgesia remains essential, and families should be counseled to return if symptoms worsen or fail to improve by 48–72 hours; if observation was initially used, a safety net for timely reassessment and antibiotic initiation is critical to avoid complications [^d9844476] [^4e339ed4].

> Let me synthesize a practical algorithm. If a child fails initial amoxicillin-clavulanate, I should reassess at 48–72 hours; if failing, I will either switch to high-dose amoxicillin-clavulanate 90/6.4 mg/kg/day divided twice daily for 10 days, or give ceftriaxone 50 mg/kg IM/IV daily for 3 days; if there is a true immediate hypersensitivity to penicillin, I will use clindamycin 30–40 mg/kg/day in 3 divided doses, and consider adding a third-generation cephalosporin if not type I allergic; if failure persists after these steps, I will pursue tympanocentesis and ENT consultation [^8072bae3] [^c25ae103].

> Finally, I should confirm special scenarios. Persistent middle ear effusion without acute symptoms is otitis media with effusion, for which antibiotics are not recommended; if effusion persists for 3 months or there is suspected hearing loss or developmental delay, arrange audiology and ENT evaluation rather than repeated antibiotics [^192a7842] [^b4b972e8].

---

After initial Augmentin (amoxicillin-clavulanate) failure for acute otitis media, **switch to high-dose amoxicillin-clavulanate (90 mg/kg/day of the amoxicillin component, 6.4 mg/kg/day of clavulanate, in 2 divided doses) for 10 days** [^8072bae3] [^361eed2e]. If there is no improvement within 48–72 hours, use **ceftriaxone (50 mg/kg IM/IV once daily for 1–3 days)** [^8072bae3] or **tympanocentesis with specialist consultation** [^c25ae103]. Avoid macrolides due to higher failure rates [^a14895c8]; reserve clindamycin for severe penicillin allergy [^notfound]. Ensure adherence, reassess at 48–72 hours, and manage pain with acetaminophen or ibuprofen [^d9844476] [^7e05fce6].

---

## Recommended treatment after initial Augmentin failure

### High-dose amoxicillin-clavulanate (Augmentin ES-600)

- **Dosage**: 90 mg/kg/day of the amoxicillin component, with 6.4 mg/kg/day of clavulanate, divided into 2 daily doses (14:1 ratio) [^8072bae3] [^361eed2e].
- **Duration**: 10 days [^51652fc0].
- **Indication**: First-line after failure of standard-dose amoxicillin-clavulanate, providing enhanced coverage against beta-lactamase–producing organisms and resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae [^8072bae3] [^19adbd18].

---

### Ceftriaxone

- **Dosage**: 50 mg/kg IM or IV once daily for 1–3 days [^8072bae3].
- **Indication**: Use if there is no improvement after 48–72 hours of high-dose amoxicillin-clavulanate, or when adherence to oral therapy is uncertain [^c25ae103].
- **Evidence**: A 3-day course is superior to 1 day for persistent AOM [^c25ae103].

---

### Tympanocentesis with specialist consultation

Tympanocentesis with specialist consultation is indicated for **persistent failure after 2–3 antibiotic courses** or when **severe infection** is present. It enables pathogen identification and susceptibility testing to guide therapy [^1656a28d].

---

## Alternative antibiotics (less preferred)

| **Antibiotic** | **Dosage** | **Indication** | **Limitations** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Clindamycin | 30–40 mg/kg/day divided TID | Severe penicillin allergy | Limited activity against H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis [^notfound] |
| Macrolides (azithromycin, clarithromycin) | Azithromycin: 10 mg/kg/day × 3 days | Penicillin allergy | Higher failure rates; not recommended unless no alternatives [^a14895c8] |

---

## Clinical assessment and follow-up

Reassess within **48–72 hours** after changing therapy to confirm improvement in symptoms and otoscopic findings [^d9844476]. Ensure adherence to therapy and address any barriers, as nonadherence is a common cause of treatment failure [^70f046e8]. Provide analgesia with acetaminophen or ibuprofen to manage pain and fever [^7e05fce6].

---

## Factors influencing antibiotic selection

- **Age**: Younger children (< 2 years) generally require more aggressive therapy due to higher risk of complications [^51652fc0].
- **Severity**: Severe symptoms (high fever, severe otalgia) warrant prompt escalation [^e258e091].
- **Allergy**: True penicillin allergy guides alternative antibiotic selection [^9f85accb].
- **Adherence**: Poor adherence may necessitate parenteral therapy (ceftriaxone) [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

After initial Augmentin failure, **escalate to high-dose amoxicillin-clavulanate**; if there is no improvement within 48–72 hours, use ceftriaxone or perform tympanocentesis. Avoid macrolides and reserve clindamycin for severe penicillin allergy. Reassess at 48–72 hours, ensure adherence, and provide analgesia.

Table 5. Bacteriologic Eradication Rates in the Per Protocol Population

Clinical assessments were made in the per protocol population 2 to 4 days post-therapy and 15 to 18 days post-therapy. Patients who responded to therapy 2 to 4 days post-therapy were followed for 15 to 18 days post-therapy to assess them for acute otitis media. Non-responders at 2 to 4 days post-therapy were considered failures at the latter timepoint. The clinical assessments in the per protocol population are presented in Table 6.

In the intent-to-treat analysis, overall clinical outcomes at 2 to 4 days and 15 to 18 days post-treatment in patients with S. pneumoniae with penicillin MIC equal to 2 mcg/mL and 4 mcg/mL were 29/41 (71%) and 17/41 (42%), respectively.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

Two clinical studies were conducted in pediatric patients with acute otitis media. A non-comparative, open-label study assessed the bacteriologic and clinical efficacy of AUGMENTIN ES-600 (90/6.4 mg/kg/day, divided every 12 hours) for 10 days in 521 pediatric patients (3 to 50 months) with acute otitis media. The primary objective was to assess bacteriological response in children with acute otitis media due to S. pneumoniae with amoxicillin/clavulanic acid MICs of 4 mcg/mL. The study sought the enrollment of patients with the following risk factors: Failure of antibacterial therapy for acute otitis media in the previous 3 months, history of recurrent episodes of acute otitis media, 2 years or younger, or daycare attendance. Prior to receiving AUGMENTIN ES-600, all patients had tympanocentesis to obtain middle ear fluid for bacteriological evaluation. Patients from whom S. pneumoniae (alone or in combination with other bacteria) was isolated had a second tympanocentesis 4 to 6 days after the start of therapy. Clinical assessments were planned for all patients during treatment (4 to 6 days after starting therapy), as well as 2 to 4 days post-treatment and 15 to 18 days post-treatment. Bacteriological success was defined as the absence of the pretreatment pathogen from the on-therapy tympanocentesis specimen. Clinical success was defined as improvement or resolution of signs and symptoms. Clinical failure was defined as lack of improvement or worsening of signs and/or symptoms at any time following at least 72 hours of AUGMENTIN ES-600; patients who received an additional systemic antibacterial drug for otitis media after 3 days of therapy were considered clinical failures. Bacteriological eradication on therapy (day 4 to 6 visit) in the per protocol population is summarized in Table 5.

1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE

AUGMENTIN ES-600 is indicated for the treatment of pediatric patients aged 3 months to 12 years weighing less than or equal to 40 kg with:

Recurrent or persistent acute otitis media due to S. pneumoniae (penicillin MICs less than or equal to 2 mcg/mL), H. influenzae (including beta-lactamase-producing strains), or M. catarrhalis (including beta-lactamase-producing strains) characterized by the following risk factors:

- Antibacterial drug exposure for acute otitis media within the preceding 3 months, and either of the following: 1) age 2 years, or younger or 2) day care attendance [see Microbiology (12.4)].

Limitations of Use

AUGMENTIN ES-600 is not indicated for the treatment of acute otitis media due to S. pneumoniae with penicillin MIC greater than or equal to 4 mcg/mL. Acute otitis media due to S. pneumoniae alone can be treated with amoxicillin. Therapy may be instituted prior to obtaining the results from bacteriological studies when there is reason to believe the infection may involve both S. pneumoniae (penicillin MIC less than or equal to 2 mcg/mL) and the beta-lactamase-producing organisms listed above.

Usage

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of AUGMENTIN ES-600 and other antibacterial drugs, AUGMENTIN ES-600 should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

14.2 Acute Bacterial Otitis Media and Diarrhea in Pediatric Patients

One US/Canadian clinical trial was conducted which compared 45/6.4 mg/kg/day (divided every 12 hours) of AUGMENTIN for 10 days versus 40/10 mg/kg/day (divided every 8 hours) of AUGMENTIN for 10 days in the treatment of acute otitis media. Only the suspension formulations were used in this trial. A total of 575 pediatric patients (aged 2 months to 12 years) were enrolled, with an even distribution among the 2 treatment groups and a comparable number of patients were evaluable (i.e., greater than or equal to 84%) per treatment group. Otitis media‑specific criteria were required for eligibility and a strong correlation was found at the end of therapy and follow‑up between these criteria and physician assessment of clinical response. The clinical efficacy rates at the end of therapy visit (defined as 2 to 4 days after the completion of therapy) and at the follow‑up visit (defined as 22 to 28 days post‑completion of therapy) were comparable for the 2 treatment groups, with the following cure rates obtained for the evaluable patients: At end of therapy, 87% (n equals 265) and 82% (n equals 260) for 45 mg/kg/day every 12 hours and 40 mg/kg/day every 8 hours, respectively. At follow‑up, 67% (n equals 249) and 69% (n equals 243) for 45 mg/kg/day every 12 hours and 40 mg/kg/day every 8 hours, respectively.

Animal Data

Reproduction studies performed in pregnant rats and mice given amoxicillin and clavulanate (2:1 ratio formulation of amoxicillin:clavulanate) at oral doses up to 1200 mg/kg/day revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus due to amoxicillin and clavulanate. The amoxicillin doses in rodents (based on body surface area and assuming a 20 kg child) were approximately 2 times (rats) or equal to (mice) the recommended clinical AUGMENTIN ES-600 dose of 90/6.4 mg/kg/day. For clavulanate, these dose multiples were approximately 15 times and 7.5 times the recommended daily dose of AUGMENTIN ES-600.

8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary

Data from a published clinical lactation study report that amoxicillin is present in human milk. There are reports of diarrhea, irritability, and rash in infants exposed to amoxicillin and clavulanate through breast milk; therefore, infants exposed to AUGMENTIN ES-600 should be monitored for these symptoms. There are no data on the effects of amoxicillin and clavulanate on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for AUGMENTIN ES-600 and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from AUGMENTIN ES-600 or from the underlying maternal condition.

8.4 Pediatric Use

Acute Otitis Media

The safety and effectiveness of AUGMENTIN ES-600 have been established in pediatric patients aged 3 months to 12 years weighing less than or equal to 40 kg, for the treatment of acute otitis media, and the information on this use is discussed throughout the labeling.

The safety and effectiveness of AUGMENTIN ES-600 in pediatric patients younger than 3 months of age have not been established.

The safety and effectiveness of Augmentin ES-600 have not been established in pediatric patients aged 3 months to 12 years weighing more than 40 kg.

Acute Bacterial Sinusitis

The safety and effectiveness of AUGMENTIN ES-600 have been established for the treatment of pediatric patients (3 months to 12 years of age) with acute bacterial sinusitis. This use is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of AUGMENTIN XRTM Extended Release Tablets in adults with acute bacterial sinusitis, studies of AUGMENTIN ES-600 in pediatric patients with acute otitis media, and by similar pharmacokinetics of amoxicillin and clavulanate in pediatric patients taking AUGMENTIN ES-600 [see Clinical Pharmacology (12)] and adults taking AUGMENTIN XR.

### The diagnosis and management of acute otitis media [^ab8bd3e3]. Pediatrics (2013). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis media (AOM) — antibiotic choice and comparative trial design — notes that amoxicillin-clavulanate has a broader spectrum than amoxicillin and may be a better initial antibiotic; however, because of cost and adverse effects, the subcommittee has chosen amoxicillin as first-line AOM treatment. For head-to-head comparisons, stringent diagnostic criteria should be the standard for these studies, antibiotic comparisons for AOM should now include an observation arm for patients with nonsevere illness to ensure a clinical benefit over placebo, and studies should also have enough patients to show small but meaningful differences. Additional research is needed to determine whether risk factors such as child care settings and siblings younger than 5 years indicate a need for different initial treatment, to develop new antibiotics that are safe and effective and test them against the currently available medications, and to conduct randomized controlled trials using different durations of antibiotic therapy in different age groups to optimize therapy with the possibility of decreasing duration of antibiotic use, which would need to be performed initially with amoxicillin and amoxicillin-clavulanate and again include an observation arm in nonsevere illness.

### Once or twice daily versus three times daily amoxicillin with or without clavulanate for the treatment of acute otitis media [^50ec338d]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Acute otitis media (AOM) is a common problem in children, for which amoxicillin, with or without clavulanate, is frequently prescribed as a treatment of choice. The conventional recommendation is either three or four daily doses. However, nowadays it is frequently prescribed as once or twice daily doses. If once or twice daily amoxicillin, with or without clavulanate, is as effective for acute otitis media as three or four times a day, it may be more convenient to give the medication once or twice a day to children and hence improve compliance.

Objectives

To compare the effectiveness of one or two daily doses with three or four daily doses of amoxicillin, with or without clavulanate, for the treatment of AOM in children; and to compare complication rates and adverse reactions.

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of children aged 12 years or younger with AOM, diagnosed by acute ear pain (otalgia) and inflamed ear drum (confirmed by positive tympanocentesis or tympanogram of type B or C).

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data on treatment outcomes from individual trials and assessed trial quality based on selection bias, performance bias and detection bias, attrition bias, reporting bias and other biases. We defined the quality grading as low risk of bias, high risk of bias or unclear risk of bias. We summarised the results as risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

We included five studies with 1601 children in the review. Pooled analysis demonstrated that the following outcomes were comparable between the two groups: clinical cure at the end of therapy (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.07); during therapy (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.33) and at follow-up (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.09); recurrent AOM (RR 1.21, 95% CI 0.52 to 2.81); compliance rate (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.10) and overall adverse events (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.63). When we performed subgroup analysis separately for trials with amoxicillin only and amoxicillin/clavulanate only, it showed that all important outcomes were comparable between once or twice daily groups and the three times daily group. The risk of bias amongst the five included studies was as follows: for random sequence generation we graded two studies as low and three unclear risk of bias; for allocation concealment all studies were at unclear risk of bias; for blinding (performance and detection bias) we graded four as high and one as unclear risk of bias; for incomplete outcome data (attrition bias) we graded two low, two high and one as unclear risk of bias; for reporting bias four were at low and one at high risk; and for 'other' bias four were at low and one at unclear risk of bias.

Authors' Conclusions

This review showed that the results of using once or twice daily doses of amoxicillin, with or without clavulanate, were comparable with three doses for the treatment of AOM.

### Increased clinical failures when treating acute otitis media with macrolides: a meta-analysis [^a14895c8]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Macrolide antibiotics are often used to treat children with acute otitis media (AOM); however, the 2004 American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and American Academy of Family Physicians guidelines recommend against their use in patients without history of a type I allergic reaction to penicillins.

Objective

To evaluate via meta-analysis the comparative efficacy of amoxicillin or amoxicillin/clavulanate to that of macrolide antibiotics in the treatment of children with AOM.

Methods

A systematic literature search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts was conducted from the earliest available date through September 2008. We used the following MeSH and key words: amoxicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanate, Augmentin, azithromycin, ceftriaxone, clarithromycin, macrolides, AND media, otitis media, and effusion. Included studies were randomized, blinded, and controlled trials evaluating guideline-recommended antibiotics (amoxicillin or amoxicillin/clavulanate) compared to macrolide antibiotics (azithromycin or clarithromycin) in AOM in children. The primary outcome assessed was clinical failure measured between days 10 and 16 after starting antibiotic therapy. Results are reported as relative risks (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals and were calculated using a random-effects model.

Results

A total of 10 trials (N = 2766) evaluating children 6 months-15 years old were included in the meta-analysis. Upon meta-analysis, the use of macrolide antibiotics was associated with an increased risk of clinical failure (RR 1.31 [95% CI 1.07 to 1.60]; p = 0.008) corresponding to a number needed to harm of 32. Upon safety analysis, rates of any adverse reaction (RR 0.74 [95% CI 0.60 to 0.90]; p = 0.003) and diarrhea (RR 0.41 [95% CI 0.32 to 0.52]; p < 0.0001) were significantly lower in the macrolide group.

Conclusions

The meta-analysis suggests that patients treated with macrolides for AOM may be more likely to have clinical failures. As such, it supports the current AAP AOM recommendation that macrolides be reserved for patients who can not receive amoxicillin or amoxicillin/clavulanate.

### Treatment of acute otitis media consensus recommendations [^1656a28d]. Clinical Pediatrics (2002). Low credibility.

The objective of this paper is to provide consensus recommendations for the management of acute otitis media (AOM) that pediatricians can incorporate into their daily practices. These recommendations were developed during a roundtable meeting that convened clinicians versed in the management of AOM. This meeting was sponsored by an educational grant from SmithKline Beecham Pharmaceuticals. In addition, clinical studies on AOM identified via MEDLINE search were considered in the development of these recommendations. The Drug-Resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae Therapeutic Working Group guidelines for the management of AOM are reviewed in detail. All of the articles identified from the data sources were evaluated and all information deemed relevant was included in this review. AOM is one of the most common infectious diseases affecting infants and children and one of the leading causes of office visits and antibiotic prescriptions for this population. The incidence of AOM has increased during the past 25 years, probably the result of an increased utilization of day care facilities in the United States. The predominant pathogens in AOM include S. pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. The high prevalence of drug-resistant S. pneumoniae and beta-lactamase-producing organisms presents a clinical challenge for practitioners in the selection of empiric antimicrobial therapy. Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic principles should be considered in addition to minimum inhibitory concentrations in selecting antibiotics for AOM. Amoxicillin at conventional or high doses (80–90 mg/kg/day) remains an appropriate choice for first-line therapy for AOM. For patients in whom amoxicillin is unsuccessful, second-line therapy should have demonstrated activity against penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae as well as beta-lactamase-producing pathogens. Appropriate options for second-line therapy include high-dose amoxicillin/clavulanate (90 mg/kg/day based on the amoxicillin component) and ceftriaxone. Cefuroxime has been suggested as a second-line agent in the past, but recent surveillance data suggest it may no longer be active against penicillin-resistant strains of S. pneumoniae. Tympanocentesis is useful for identifying the causative pathogen, and it may be beneficial for patients who have failed multiple courses of antibiotics. The pneumococcal conjugate vaccine recently was approved for use in children and should be administered to all children less than 2 years old and those at risk for recurrent AOM (e.g., day care attendance, siblings with a history of recurrent AOM). Consensus recommendations are provided for the management of AOM, with a focus on antimicrobial therapy. The current challenges in the management of AOM include the need for an increased understanding of epidemiology, increasing resistance among common middle ear pathogens, use of pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic principles in designing treatment strategies, and understanding the potential impact of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine.

### The diagnosis and management of acute otitis media [^c25ae103]. Pediatrics (2013). Medium credibility.

Initial antibiotic treatment failure in AOM — monitoring and next steps are as follows: When antibiotics are prescribed, clinical improvement should be noted within 48 to 72 hours; during the 24 hours after diagnosis symptoms may worsen slightly, then should begin to improve in the next 24 hours, and if initially febrile, temperature should decline within 48 to 72 hours. If the patient is not improved by 48 to 72 hours, reassess for another disease, concomitant viral infection, or resistance. Evidence on clinical–bacteriologic correlation is mixed, with some studies reporting good correlation ranging from 86% to 91% and others reporting sterile middle ear fluid in 42% to 49% of cases. A change in antibiotic may not be required in some children with mild persistent symptoms; however, in children with persistent, severe symptoms and unimproved otologic findings after initial treatment, the clinician may consider changing the antibiotic. If initially treated with amoxicillin and failed to improve, amoxicillin-clavulanate should be used; patients previously given amoxicillin-clavulanate or oral third-generation cephalosporins may receive intramuscular ceftriaxone (50 mg/kg), and in AOM unresponsive to initial antibiotics, a 3-day course of ceftriaxone has been shown to be better than a 1-day regimen.

### Diagnosis and management of acute otitis media… [^59862233]. publications.aap.org (2025). Medium credibility.

This evidence-based clinical practice guideline provides recommendations to primary care clinicians for the management of children from 2 months through 12 years of age with uncomplicated acute otitis media. The American Academy of Pediatrics and American Academy of Family Physicians convened a committee composed of primary care physicians and experts in the fields of otolaryngology, epidemiology, and infectious disease. The subcommittee partnered with the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and the Southern California Evidence-Based Practice Center to develop a comprehensive review of the evidence-based literature related to AOM. The resulting evidence report and other sources of data were used to formulate the practice guideline recommendations. The focus of this practice guideline is the appropriate diagnosis and initial treatment of a child presenting with AOM. The guideline provides a specific definition of AOM.

It addresses pain management, initial observation versus antibacterial treatment, appropriate choices of antibacterials, and preventive measures. Decisions were made based on a systematic grading of the quality of evidence and strength of recommendations, as well as expert consensus when definitive data were not available. The practice guideline underwent comprehensive peer review before formal approval by the partnering organizations. This clinical practice guideline is not intended as a sole source of guidance in the management of children with AOM. Rather, it is intended to assist primary care clinicians by providing a framework for clinical decision-making. It is not intended to replace clinical judgment or establish a protocol for all children with this condition. These recommendations may not provide the only appropriate approach to the management of this problem.

Comments This guideline could as well have suggested initial observation with analgesia for all I think this clinical practice guideline reflects an American prescribing bias. There are several problems with the methods used: Implementing this guideline in my country would raise the prescription rate. As I see it, this CPG could as well have suggested initial observation with analgesia for all. Reference 1. Glasziou PP, Del Mar CB, Sanders SL, Hayem M.

### Amoxicillin / clavulanate for infections in infants and children: past, present and future [^c4974836]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2003). Low credibility.

Chemical synthesis of the penicillin nucleus in the 1950s made introduction of a broad array of new and important antimicrobials, including ampicillin and amoxicillin, possible. Ampicillin was introduced in 1962 in oral and parenteral forms as the first of the semisynthetic penicillins to provide increased activity against Gram-negative bacteria. Amoxicillin replaced oral ampicillin beginning in 1974 because amoxicillin resulted in higher and more prolonged serum concentrations than did equivalent doses of ampicillin. Amoxicillin/clavulanate (Augmentin) was introduced in the United States in 1984 to enhance the activity of amoxicillin by addition of the beta-lactamase inhibitor, clavulanic acid. During the past 20 years, amoxicillin/clavulanate has proven effective for a variety of pediatric infectious diseases, particularly acute otitis media (AOM). In 2001, a new pediatric formulation, high dose amoxicillin/clavulanate (Augmentin ES-600) was approved for use in the United States. The high dose preparation addressed the needs of pediatricians by providing greater amounts of amoxicillin while maintaining the same daily dose of clavulanic acid as the regular strength formulation. Doubling the dose of amoxicillin for management of recurrent and persistent AOM was recommended in 1999 by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention because of concern about the increased incidence of nonsusceptible strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae. The original formulation combined amoxicillin/clavulanate in a 4:1 ratio and was followed by a 7:1 ratio formulation. The high dose formulation (600 mg of amoxicillin per 5 ml) provides a 14:1 ratio of amoxicillin to clavulanate. Although management of AOM will likely undergo changes in the coming years, amoxicillin is expected to remain first line therapy for AOM. For children who fail initial therapy with amoxicillin, high dose amoxicillin/clavulanate, an oral cephalosporin or parenteral ceftriaxone is recommended.

### Treatment of acute otitis media in children under 2 years of age [^b5433c00]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2011). Excellent credibility.

Background

Recommendations vary regarding immediate antimicrobial treatment versus watchful waiting for children younger than 2 years of age with acute otitis media.

Methods

We randomly assigned 291 children 6 to 23 months of age, with acute otitis media diagnosed with the use of stringent criteria, to receive amoxicillin-clavulanate or placebo for 10 days. We measured symptomatic response and rates of clinical failure.

Results

Among the children who received amoxicillin-clavulanate, 35% had initial resolution of symptoms by day 2, 61% by day 4, and 80% by day 7; among children who received placebo, 28% had initial resolution of symptoms by day 2, 54% by day 4, and 74% by day 7 (P = 0.14 for the overall comparison). For sustained resolution of symptoms, the corresponding values were 20%, 41%, and 67% with amoxicillin-clavulanate, as compared with 14%, 36%, and 53% with placebo (P = 0.04 for the overall comparison). Mean symptom scores over the first 7 days were lower for the children treated with amoxicillin-clavulanate than for those who received placebo (P = 0.02). The rate of clinical failure — defined as the persistence of signs of acute infection on otoscopic examination — was also lower among the children treated with amoxicillin-clavulanate than among those who received placebo: 4% versus 23% at or before the visit on day 4 or 5 (P < 0.001) and 16% versus 51% at or before the visit on day 10 to 12 (P < 0.001). Mastoiditis developed in one child who received placebo. Diarrhea and diaper-area dermatitis were more common among children who received amoxicillin-clavulanate. There were no significant changes in either group in the rates of nasopharyngeal colonization with nonsusceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae.

Conclusions

Among children 6 to 23 months of age with acute otitis media, treatment with amoxicillin-clavulanate for 10 days tended to reduce the time to resolution of symptoms and reduced the overall symptom burden and the rate of persistent signs of acute infection on otoscopic examination.

### Diagnosis and treatment of acute otitis media: evaluating the evidence [^0da32aa3]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

Acute otitis media (AOM) is one of the most common illnesses for which children in the United States receive an antimicrobial agent. Of the six recommendations offered in recent guidelines for treatment of AOM, only one, the assessment and treatment of pain with analgesics, is based on strong evidence. This article reviews the diagnosis of AOM and the accuracy of various signs and symptoms in indicating a bacterial origin, the data on the effect of antimicrobial agents compared with placebo in the treatment of AOM, and the gaps in knowledge that should be addressed by future research and clinical trials.

### Otitis media [^f8fc8302]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Acute otitis media (AOM) is diagnosed based on visualization of a full or bulging tympanic membrane with middle ear effusion. The distribution of bacteria causing AOM in North America under the influence of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination and antibiotic selection pressure has resulted in a predominance of β-lactamase-producing Haemophilus influenzae followed by penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae. Although guidelines continue to endorse amoxicillin as the preferred treatment, amoxicillin/clavulanate in high dosage would be the preferred treatment based on the otopathogen mix currently. Antibiotic prophylaxis has fallen into disfavor as a preventative strategy for AOM recurrences.

For Recommendation, "A recommendation in favor of a particular action is made when the anticipated benefits exceed the harms, but the quality of evidence is not as strong," with the implication that "Clinicians would be prudent to follow a recommendation but should remain alert to new information and sensitive to patient preferences." For Option, "Options define courses that may be taken when either the quality of evidence is suspect or carefully performed studies have shown little clear advantage to 1 approach over another," and "Clinicians should consider the option in their decision-making, and patient preference may have a substantial role." For No Recommendation, "No recommendation indicates that there is a lack of pertinent published evidence and that the anticipated balance of benefits and harms is presently unclear," and "Clinicians should be alert to new published evidence that clarifies the balance of benefit versus harm."

### Otitis media: diagnosis and treatment [^7e05fce6]. American Family Physician (2013). Low credibility.

Acute otitis media is diagnosed in patients with acute onset, presence of middle ear effusion, physical evidence of middle ear inflammation, and symptoms such as pain, irritability, or fever. Acute otitis media is usually a complication of eustachian tube dysfunction that occurs during a viral upper respiratory tract infection. Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis are the most common organisms isolated from middle ear fluid. Management of acute otitis media should begin with adequate analgesia. Antibiotic therapy can be deferred in children two years or older with mild symptoms. High-dose amoxicillin (80 to 90 mg per kg per day) is the antibiotic of choice for treating acute otitis media in patients who are not allergic to penicillin. Children with persistent symptoms despite 48 to 72 hours of antibiotic therapy should be reexamined, and a second-line agent, such as amoxicillin/clavulanate, should be used if appropriate. Otitis media with effusion is defined as middle ear effusion in the absence of acute symptoms. Antibiotics, decongestants, or nasal steroids do not hasten the clearance of middle ear fluid and are not recommended. Children with evidence of anatomic damage, hearing loss, or language delay should be referred to an otolaryngologist.

### A placebo-controlled trial of antimicrobial treatment for acute otitis media [^762da0e2]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2011). Excellent credibility.

Background

The efficacy of antimicrobial treatment in children with acute otitis media remains controversial.

Methods

In this randomized, double-blind trial, children 6 to 35 months of age with acute otitis media, diagnosed with the use of strict criteria, received amoxicillin-clavulanate (161 children) or placebo (158 children) for 7 days. The primary outcome was the time to treatment failure from the first dose until the end-of-treatment visit on day 8. The definition of treatment failure was based on the overall condition of the child (including adverse events) and otoscopic signs of acute otitis media.

Results

Treatment failure occurred in 18.6% of the children who received amoxicillin-clavulanate, as compared with 44.9% of the children who received placebo (P < 0.001). The difference between the groups was already apparent at the first scheduled visit (day 3), at which time 13.7% of the children who received amoxicillin-clavulanate, as compared with 25.3% of those who received placebo, had treatment failure. Overall, amoxicillin-clavulanate reduced the progression to treatment failure by 62% (hazard ratio, 0.38; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.25 to 0.59; P < 0.001) and the need for rescue treatment by 81% (6.8% vs. 33.5%; hazard ratio, 0.19; 95% CI, 0.10 to 0.36; P < 0.001). Analgesic or antipyretic agents were given to 84.2% and 85.9% of the children in the amoxicillin-clavulanate and placebo groups, respectively. Adverse events were significantly more common in the amoxicillin-clavulanate group than in the placebo group. A total of 47.8% of the children in the amoxicillin-clavulanate group had diarrhea, as compared with 26.6% in the placebo group (P < 0.001); 8.7% and 3.2% of the children in the respective groups had eczema (P = 0.04).

Conclusions

Children with acute otitis media benefit from antimicrobial treatment as compared with placebo, although they have more side effects. Future studies should identify patients who may derive the greatest benefit, in order to minimize unnecessary antimicrobial treatment and the development of bacterial resistance.

### Diagnosis and management of acute otitis media in the urgent care setting [^6489e4b6]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

The prevalence of otitis media is increasing, which affects health care resource utilization across all segments, including the urgent care setting. One of the greatest challenges in the management of acute otitis media (AOM) is the effective treatment of cases caused by pathogens that are resistant to commonly used antibiotics. Whereas the production of beta-lactamases among strains of Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis is an important consideration for antimicrobial therapy, the high prevalence of resistance to penicillin and other classes of antibiotics among strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae represents a greater clinical concern. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently convened the Drug Resistant S. pneumoniae Therapeutic Working Group to develop evidence-based recommendations for the treatment of AOM in an era of prevalent resistance. The recommendations from this group included amoxicillin as the preferred first-line drug because of the demonstrated activity against penicillin-intermediate and -resistant strains of S. pneumoniae, using higher dosages of up to 90 mg/kg per day in certain settings. For patients in whom initial treatment is unsuccessful after 3 days, the recommended agents included high-dose amoxicillin-clavulanate (for activity against beta-lactamase-producing pathogens), clindamycin, cefuroxime axetil, or 1 to 3 doses of intramuscular ceftriaxone. The principles set forth in these guidelines can assist the therapeutic decisionmaking process for practitioners in the urgent care setting.

### Amoxicillan and clavulanate potassium [^65596aa1]. FDA (2014). Low credibility.

The number of bacteriologically evaluable patients was comparable between the two dosing regimens. Amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium produced comparable bacteriological success rates in patients assessed 2 to 4 days immediately following end of therapy. The bacteriologic efficacy rates were comparable at one of the follow-up visits (5 to 9 days post-therapy) and at a late post-therapy visit (in the majority of cases, this was 2 to 4 weeks post-therapy).

As noted before, though there was no significant difference in the percentage of adverse events in each group, there was a statistically significant difference in rates of severe diarrhea or withdrawals with diarrhea between the regimens.

14.2 Acute Bacterial Otitis Media and Diarrhea in Pediatric Patients

One U.S./Canadian clinical trial was conducted which compared 45/6.4 mg/kg/day (divided every 12 hours) of amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium for 10 days versus 40/10 mg/kg/day (divided every 8 hours) of amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium for 10 days in the treatment of acute otitis media. Only the suspension formulations were used in this trial. A total of 575 pediatric patients (aged 2 months to 12 years) were enrolled, with an even distribution among the 2 treatment groups and a comparable number of patients were evaluable (i.e., ≥ 84%) per treatment group. Otitis media-specific criteria were required for eligibility and a strong correlation was found at the end of therapy and follow-up between these criteria and physician assessment of clinical response. The clinical efficacy rates at the end of therapy visit (defined as 2 to 4 days after the completion of therapy) and at the follow-up visit (defined as 22 to 28 days post-completion of therapy) were comparable for the 2 treatment groups, with the following cure rates obtained for the evaluable patients: At end of therapy, 87% (n = 265) and 82% (n = 260) for 45 mg/kg/day every 12 hours and 40 mg/kg/day every 8 hours, respectively. At follow-up, 67% (n = 249) and 69% (n = 243) for 45 mg/kg/day every 12 hours and 40 mg/kg/day every 8 hours, respectively.

### The diagnosis and management of acute otitis media [^4b9cf575]. Pediatrics (2013). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis media (AOM) randomized trial in children 6 to 23 months — amoxicillin-clavulanate versus placebo — reported symptom resolution, failure, and adverse events with quantified effects. Included in the study were 291 patients 6 to 23 months of age: 144 in the antibiotic group and 147 in the placebo group. Initial resolution (AOM-SOS score 0 or 1) with amoxicillin-clavulanate occurred in 35% by day 2, 61% by day 4, and 80% by day 7, versus 28%, 54%, and 74% with placebo (P = 0.14). For sustained resolution (second of 2 successive AOM-SOS 0 or 1), values were 20% by day 2, 41% at day 4, and 67% at day 7 with amoxicillin-clavulanate versus 14%, 36%, and 53% with placebo (P = 0.04). Treatment failure occurred by day 4 to 5 in 4% with antimicrobial treatment versus 23% with placebo (P < .001) and at day 10 to 12 in 16% versus 51% (NNT = 2.9, P < .001). By day 10 to 12, clinical failure in unilateral AOM was 9% with amoxicillin-clavulanate versus 41% with placebo (RD, 32%; NNT = 3), and in bilateral AOM was 23% versus 60% (RD, 37%; NNT = 3). Most common adverse events were diarrhea (25% vs 15%; P = 0.05) and diaper dermatitis (51% vs 35%; P = 0.008), and one placebo recipient developed mastoiditis.

### Prognostic factors for treatment failure in acute otitis media [^45999373]. Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Antimicrobial treatment is effective in the management of acute otitis media (AOM), but approximately half of the children may recover without antimicrobial agents. By identifying patients who may not require antimicrobial treatment for the management of AOM, the use of antimicrobial agents could be substantially reduced. Our aim was to identify subgroups of children with AOM who would benefit most from antimicrobial treatment and children who could be suitable for initial observation.

Methods

This is a secondary analysis of randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Children 6 to 35 months of age with AOM (N = 319) were randomly allocated to receive amoxicillin-clavulanate (40/5.7 mg/kg per day) or placebo for 7 days. Our primary outcome was time until treatment failure.

Results

Treatment failure occurred in 31.7% of all children. Older age (24–35 months) and peaked tympanogram at entry decreased the hazard for treatment failure (hazard ratio, 0.53; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.29 to 0.96; P = 0.04; and hazard ratio, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.21 to 0.88; P = 0.02, respectively). The rate difference for treatment failure between antimicrobial treatment and placebo groups was highest among children with severe bulging of the tympanic membrane (11.1% vs 64.1%; rate difference -53.0%; 95% CI, -73.5% to -32.4%), resulting in a number needed to treat of 1.9.

Conclusions

Children with severe bulging of the tympanic membrane seem to benefit most from antimicrobial treatment of AOM. On the other hand, children with peaked tympanogram (A and C curves) may be optimal candidates for initial observation.

Amoxicillin-clavulanate versus placebo in acute otitis media — randomized trial outcomes report baseline age distribution, efficacy, and adverse events: in the treatment group, 135 of 161 patients (84%) were younger than 24 months versus 124 of 158 (78%) in placebo; treatment failure occurred in 18.6% versus 44.9% (NNT = 3.8, P < .001), rescue treatment was needed in 6.8% versus 33.5% (P < .001), contralateral AOM developed in 8.2% versus 18.6% (P = 0.007), and use of analgesic or antipyretic medicine was 84.2% versus 85.9%. Parents of child care attendees on placebo missed more days of work (P = 0.005); clinical failure in unilateral AOM was 17.2% versus 42.7% and in bilateral AOM 21.7% versus 46.3%, with day 8 failures 17.2% versus 42.7% (unilateral) and 21.7% vs 46.3% (bilateral). Adverse events occurred in 52.8% versus 36.1% (P = 0.003), overall condition and tympanic membrane appearance favored antibiotics at end of treatment (P < .001), and two placebo recipients developed severe infection (pneumococcal bacteremia or radiographically confirmed pneumonia).

### Updated guidelines for the management of acute otitis media in children by the Italian Society of Pediatrics: treatment [^a5c59683]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

New insights into the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of acute otitis media (AOM) have been gained in recent years. For this reason, the Italian Paediatric Society has updated its 2010 guidelines.

Methods

A literature search was carried out on PubMed. Only pediatric studies published between January 1, 2010 and December 31, 2018 in English or Italian were included. Each included study was assessed according to the GRADE methodology. The quality of the systematic reviews was assessed using AMSTAR 2. The recommendations were formulated by a multidisciplinary panel of experts.

Results

Prompt antibiotic treatment is recommended for children with otorrhea, intracranial complications and/or a history of recurrence and for children under the age of 6 months. For children 6 months to 2 years of age, prompt antibiotic treatment is recommended for all forms of unilateral and bilateral AOM, whether mild or severe. Prompt antibiotic treatment is also recommended for children over 2 years with severe bilateral AOM. A watchful-waiting approach can be applied to children over 2 years with mild or severe unilateral AOM or mild bilateral AOM. High doses of amoxicillin, or amoxicillin-clavulanic acid for patients with a high risk of infection by Beta-lactamase producing strains, remain the first-line antibiotics.

Conclusions

AOM should be managed on a case-by-case basis that takes account of the child's age, the severity of the episode and whether it is unilateral or bilateral. In patients under 2 years, prompt antibiotic treatment is always recommended.

### Shortened antimicrobial treatment for acute otitis media in young children [^0cbe4867]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2016). Excellent credibility.

Background

Limiting the duration of antimicrobial treatment constitutes a potential strategy to reduce the risk of antimicrobial resistance among children with acute otitis media.

Methods

We assigned 520 children, 6 to 23 months of age, with acute otitis media to receive amoxicillin-clavulanate either for a standard duration of 10 days or for a reduced duration of 5 days followed by placebo for 5 days. We measured rates of clinical response (in a systematic fashion, on the basis of signs and symptomatic response), recurrence, and nasopharyngeal colonization, and we analyzed episode outcomes using a noninferiority approach. Symptom scores ranged from 0 to 14, with higher numbers indicating more severe symptoms.

Results

Children who were treated with amoxicillin-clavulanate for 5 days were more likely than those who were treated for 10 days to have clinical failure (77 of 229 children [34%] vs. 39 of 238 [16%]; difference, 17 percentage points [based on unrounded data]; 95% confidence interval, 9 to 25). The mean symptom scores over the period from day 6 to day 14 were 1.61 in the 5-day group and 1.34 in the 10-day group (P = 0.07); the mean scores at the day-12-to-14 assessment were 1.89 versus 1.20 (P = 0.001). The percentage of children whose symptom scores decreased more than 50% (indicating less severe symptoms) from baseline to the end of treatment was lower in the 5-day group than in the 10-day group (181 of 227 children [80%] vs. 211 of 233 [91%], P = 0.003). We found no significant between-group differences in rates of recurrence, adverse events, or nasopharyngeal colonization with penicillin-nonsusceptible pathogens. Clinical-failure rates were greater among children who had been exposed to three or more children for 10 or more hours per week than among those with less exposure (P = 0.02) and were also greater among children with infection in both ears than among those with infection in one ear (P < 0.001).

Conclusions

Among children 6 to 23 months of age with acute otitis media, reduced-duration antimicrobial treatment resulted in less favorable outcomes than standard-duration treatment; in addition, neither the rate of adverse events nor the rate of emergence of antimicrobial resistance was lower with the shorter regimen.

CLINICAL STUDIES

Acute Bacterial Sinusitis

Adults with a diagnosis of acute bacterial sinusitis (ABS) were
evaluated in 3 clinical studies. In one study, 363 patients were randomized to
receive either AUGMENTIN XR 2,000 mg/125 mg orally every 12 hours or
levofloxacin 500 mg orally daily for 10 days in a double-blind, multicenter,
prospective trial. These patients were clinically and radiologically evaluated
at the test of cure (day 17–28) visit. The combined clinical and radiological
responses were 83.7% for AUGMENTIN XR and 84.3% for levofloxacin at the test of
cure visit in clinically evaluable patients (95% CI for the treatment difference
-9.4, 8.3). The clinical response rates at the test of cure were 87.0% and
88.6%, respectively.

The other 2 trials were non-comparative, multicenter studies designed to
assess the bacteriological and clinical efficacy of AUGMENTIN XR (2,000
mg/125 mg orally every 12 hours for 10 days) in the treatment of 2288 patients
with ABS. Evaluation timepoints were the same as in the prior study. Patients
underwent maxillary sinus puncture for culture prior to receiving study
medication. At test of cure, the clinical success rates were 87.5% and 86.6%
(intention-to-treat) and 92.5% and 92.1% (per protocol populations).

### Evidence assessment of management of acute otitis media: I. the role of antibiotics in treatment of uncomplicated acute otitis media [^ca02a8d5]. Pediatrics (2001). Low credibility.

Context

In 1995, > 5 million episodes of acute otitis media (AOM) accounted for $3 billion in health care expenditures.

Objectives

To synthesize the literature on the natural history of AOM, the effectiveness of antibiotic treatment in uncomplicated AOM, and the relative effectiveness of specific antibiotic regimens.

Data Sources

Seven electronic databases for articles published between 1966 and March 1999 and reference lists in proceedings, published articles, reports, and guidelines.

Study Selection

Two physicians independently assessed each article. Studies addressing AOM in children 4 weeks to 18 years old were included; those addressing children with immunodeficiencies or craniofacial abnormalities were excluded. Randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) were used to assess antibiotic effectiveness, and RCTs and cohort studies were used to assess the natural history of AOM. Among the 3491 citations identified, 80 (2.3%) met our inclusion criteria.

Data Extraction

Two physicians independently abstracted data and assessed the quality of studies using a validated scale for RCTs and 8 quality components for cohort studies.

Data Synthesis

Random-effects estimates of pooled absolute rate differences of outcomes were derived, and heterogeneity of both the rates and rate differences was assessed. Children with AOM not treated with antibiotics experienced a 1- to 7-day clinical failure rate of 19% (95% confidence interval: 0.10–0.28) and few suppurative complications. When patients were treated with amoxicillin, the 2- to 7-day clinical failure rate was reduced to 7%, a 12% (95% confidence interval: 0.04–0.20) reduction. Adverse effects, primarily gastrointestinal, were more common among children on cefixime than among those on ampicillin or amoxicillin. They were also more common among children on amoxicillin-clavulanate than among those on azithromycin.

Conclusions

The majority of uncomplicated cases of AOM resolve spontaneously without apparent suppurative complications. Ampicillin or amoxicillin confers a limited therapeutic benefit. There is no evidence to support any particular antibiotic regimens as more effective at relieving symptoms. Certain antibiotics are more likely than others to cause diarrhea and other adverse events.

### The diagnosis and management of acute otitis media [^5374ea0f]. Pediatrics (2013). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis media (AOM) — bacterial susceptibility to antibiotics and dosing: Early studies show that 19% of children with S pneumoniae and 48% with H influenzae cultured on initial tympanocentesis who were not treated with antibiotic cleared the bacteria at the time of a second tympanocentesis 2 to 7 days later, and approximately 75% of children infected with M catarrhalis experienced bacteriologic cure even after treatment with amoxicillin, an antibiotic to which it is not susceptible. Current US data indicate that approximately 83% and 87% of isolates of S pneumoniae from all age groups are susceptible to regular (40 mg/kg/day) and high-dose amoxicillin (80–90 mg/kg/day divided twice daily), respectively. High-dose amoxicillin will yield middle ear fluid levels that exceed the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of all S pneumoniae serotypes that are intermediately resistant to penicillin (penicillin MICs, 0.12–1.0 μg/mL), and may not hit all highly resistant serotypes (penicillin MICs, ≥ 2 μg/mL) for a longer period of the dosing interval and has been shown to improve bacteriologic and clinical efficacy.

### Diagnosis and management of acute otitis media [^6eddd9b3]. Pediatrics (2004). Low credibility.

This evidence-based clinical practice guideline provides recommendations to primary care clinicians for the management of children from 2 months through 12 years of age with uncomplicated acute otitis media (AOM). The American Academy of Pediatrics and American Academy of Family Physicians convened a committee composed of primary care physicians and experts in the fields of otolaryngology, epidemiology, and infectious disease. The subcommittee partnered with the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and the Southern California Evidence-Based Practice Center to develop a comprehensive review of the evidence-based literature related to AOM. The resulting evidence report and other sources of data were used to formulate the practice guideline recommendations. The focus of this practice guideline is the appropriate diagnosis and initial treatment of a child presenting with AOM. The guideline provides a specific definition of AOM. It addresses pain management, initial observation versus antibacterial treatment, appropriate choices of antibacterials, and preventive measures. Decisions were made based on a systematic grading of the quality of evidence and strength of recommendations, as well as expert consensus when definitive data were not available. The practice guideline underwent comprehensive peer review before formal approval by the partnering organizations. This clinical practice guideline is not intended as a sole source of guidance in the management of children with AOM. Rather, it is intended to assist primary care clinicians by providing a framework for clinical decision-making. It is not intended to replace clinical judgment or establish a protocol for all children with this condition. These recommendations may not provide the only appropriate approach to the management of this problem.

### Delayed versus immediate antimicrobial treatment for acute otitis media [^ebdf9764]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Watchful waiting with the option of delayed antimicrobial treatment for acute otitis media is recommended in several guidelines. Our aim was to study whether delayed, as compared with immediate, initiation of antimicrobial treatment worsens the recovery from acute otitis media in young children.

Methods

Children (6–35 months) with acute otitis media received either delayed or immediate antimicrobial treatment with amoxicillin-clavulanate for 7 days. The delayed antimicrobial treatment group (n = 53) consisted of placebo recipients from a randomized-controlled trial to whom antimicrobial treatment was initiated after a watchful waiting period. The immediate antimicrobial treatment group (n = 161) consisted of children allocated to receive antimicrobial treatment immediately.

Results

Improvement during antimicrobial treatment (which includes both symptoms and otoscopic signs) was observed in 91% and 96% of children in the delayed and immediate antimicrobial treatment groups, respectively (P = 0.15). Median watchful waiting period was 48 hours. Delayed initiation of antimicrobial treatment was associated with prolonged resolution of fever, ear pain, poor appetite and decreased activity, but not ear rubbing, irritability, restless sleep or excessive crying. Parents of children in the delayed antimicrobial treatment group missed more work days (mean 2.1 versus 1.2 days, P = 0.03). Diarrhea, vomiting and rash were equally common in both groups.

Conclusions

Our results indicate that delayed initiation of antimicrobial treatment does not worsen the recovery from acute otitis media, as measured by improvement during treatment. However, watchful waiting before the initiation of delayed antimicrobial treatment might be associated with transient worsening of a child's condition, prolongation of symptoms and economic losses.

### Management of acute otitis media after publication of the 2004 AAP and AAFP clinical practice guideline [^bfc9623c]. Pediatrics (2010). Low credibility.

Objectives

Observation without initial antibiotic therapy was accepted as an option for acute otitis media (AOM) management in the 2004 American Academy of Pediatrics and American Academy of Family Physicians clinical practice guideline. The guideline also recommended amoxicillin as the first-line treatment for most children, and analgesic treatment to reduce pain if it was present. Our objective was to compare the management of AOM after publication of the 2004 guideline.

Patients and Methods

We analyzed the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, 2002–2006 (N = 1114), which occurred in US physicians' offices. The patients were children aged 6 months to 12 years who were diagnosed with AOM. The time comparisons were the 30-month periods before and after the guideline. The main outcome was the encounter rate at which no antibiotic-prescribing was reported. Secondary outcomes were the identification of factors associated with encounters at which no antibiotic-prescribing was reported and antibiotic- and analgesic-prescribing rates.

Results

The rate of AOM encounters at which no antibiotic-prescribing was reported did not change after guideline publication (11%-16%; P = 0.103). Independent predictors of an encounter at which no antibiotic-prescribing was reported were the absence of ear pain, absence of reported fever, and receipt of an analgesic prescription. After guideline publication, the rate of amoxicillin-prescribing increased (40%-49%; P = 0.039), the rate of amoxicillin/clavulanate-prescribing decreased (23%-16%; P = 0.043), the rate of cefdinir-prescribing increased (7%-14%; P = 0.004), and the rate of analgesic-prescribing increased (14%-24%; P = 0.038).

Conclusions

Although management of AOM without antibiotics has not increased after the publication of the 2004 American Academy of Pediatrics and American Academy of Family Physicians clinical practice guideline, children who did not receive antibiotics were more likely to have mild infections. In accordance with the guideline, the prescribing of amoxicillin and analgesics has increased. Contrary to the guideline, the prescribing of amoxicillin/clavulanate has decreased, whereas the prescribing of cefdinir has increased.

### Treatment and prevention of otitis media [^70f046e8]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2000). Low credibility.

Objective

To review and summarize recent advances in the treatment and prevention of otitis media (OM).

Data Sources

A MEDLINE search (1996-March 2000) was performed to identify relevant primary and review articles. References from these articles were also reviewed if deemed important.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

English-language primary and review articles focusing on the treatment and prevention of acute otitis media (AOM) were included. Studies focusing exclusively on OM with effusion or serous OM and chronic suppurative OM were excluded. Information regarding prevention and drug therapy was reviewed, with an emphasis placed on advances made in the last two years.

Data Synthesis

Recently, an expert panel of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended use of only three of 16 systemic antibiotics approved by the Food and Drug Administration for treatment of AOM: amoxicillin, cefuroxime axetil, and ceftriaxone. Controversy exists over the importance of key selection factors used by the expert panel in determining which antibiotics to recommend in a two-step treatment algorithm, that is, in vitro data, pharmacodynamic profiles, and necessity for coverage of drug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae at all steps of empiric treatment. Additional antibiotic and patient selection factors useful for individualizing therapy include clinical efficacy, adverse effects, frequency and duration of administration, taste, cost, comorbid infections, and ramifications should bacterial resistance develop to the chosen antibiotic. Presumed or past patient/caregiver adherence (especially when antibiotic failure has occurred) is also paramount in selecting antibiotic therapy. A three-step treatment algorithm for refractory AOM that employs amoxicillin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX), or high-dose amoxicillin/clavulanate (depending on the prior dose of and adherence to amoxicillin therapy), and ceftriaxone or tympanocentesis at steps 1, 2, and 3, respectively, appears rational and cost-effective. The recent upsurge in antimicrobial resistance is highlighted, and recommendations are presented for the treatment of AOM and prevention of recurrent otitis media (rAOM).

Conclusions

Amoxicillin remains the antibiotic of choice for initial empiric treatment of AOM, although the traditional dosage should be increased in patients at risk for drug-resistant S. pneumoniae. In cases refractory to high-dose amoxicillin, TMP/SMX should be prescribed if adherence to prior therapy seemed good or complete, or high-dose amoxicillin/clavulanate if adherence was incomplete or questionable. Ceftriaxone should be reserved as third-line treatment. The increasing prevalence of drug-resistant S. pneumoniae emphasizes the importance of alternative medical approaches for the prevention of OM, as well as judicious antibiotic use in established cases. Removal of modifiable risk factors should be first-line therapy for prevention of rAOM. We support the use of conjugate pneumococcal vaccine per guidelines for prevention of rAOM from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practice of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, with consideration given to influenza vaccine for cases of rAOM that historically worsen during the flu season. Sulfisoxazole prophylaxis should be reserved for children who are immunocompromised, have concurrent disease states exacerbated by AOM, or meet the criteria of rAOM despite conjugate pneumococcal and influenza vaccination. Therapy should be intermittent, beginning at the first sign of an upper respiratory infection, and should continue for 10 days. The invasive nature and risks of anesthesia relegate myringotomy, tympanostomy tubes, and adenoidectomy to last-line therapies for rAOM.

### Antibiotics for acute otitis media in children [^c81573d5]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute otitis media (AOM) is one of the most common diseases in childhood for which antibiotics are commonly prescribed; a systematic review reported a pooled prevalence of 85.6% in high-income countries. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in the Cochrane Library in 1997 and updated in 1999, 2005, 2009, 2013 and 2015.

Objectives

To assess the effects of antibiotics for children with AOM.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Current Contents, CINAHL, LILACS and two trial registers. The date of the search was 14 February 2023.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials comparing 1) antimicrobial drugs with placebo, and 2) immediate antibiotic treatment with expectant observation (including delayed antibiotic prescribing) in children with AOM.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened trials for inclusion and extracted data using the standard methodological procedures recommended by Cochrane. Our primary outcomes were: 1) pain at various time points (24 hours, two to three days, four to seven days, 10 to 14 days), and 2) adverse effects likely to be related to the use of antibiotics. Secondary outcomes were: 1) abnormal tympanometry findings, 2) tympanic membrane perforation, 3) contralateral otitis (in unilateral cases), 4) AOM recurrences, 5) serious complications related to AOM and 6) long-term effects (including the number of parent-reported AOM symptom episodes, antibiotic prescriptions and health care utilisation as assessed at least one year after randomisation). We used the GRADE approach to rate the overall certainty of evidence for each outcome of interest.

Main Results

Antibiotics versus placebo We included 13 trials (3401 children and 3938 AOM episodes) from high-income countries, which we assessed at generally low risk of bias. Antibiotics do not reduce pain at 24 hours (risk ratio (RR) 0.89, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.78 to 1.01; 5 trials, 1394 children; high-certainty evidence), or at four to seven days (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.14; 7 trials, 1264 children), but result in almost a third fewer children having pain at two to three days (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.88; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 20; 7 trials, 2320 children; high-certainty evidence), and likely result in two-thirds fewer having pain at 10 to 12 days (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.66; NNTB 7; 1 trial, 278 children; moderate-certainty evidence). Antibiotics increase the risk of adverse events such as vomiting, diarrhoea or rash (RR 1.38, 95% CI 1.16 to 1.63; number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) 14; 8 trials, 2107 children; high-certainty evidence). Antibiotics reduce the risk of children having abnormal tympanometry findings at two to four weeks (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.96; NNTB 11; 7 trials, 2138 children), slightly reduce the risk of experiencing tympanic membrane perforations (RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.89; NNTB 33; 5 trials, 1075 children) and halve the risk of contralateral otitis episodes (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.95; NNTB 11; 4 trials, 906 children). However, antibiotics do not reduce the risk of abnormal tympanometry findings at six to eight weeks (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.13; 3 trials, 953 children) and at three months (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.34; 3 trials, 809 children) or late AOM recurrences (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.11; 6 trials, 2200 children). Severe complications were rare, and the evidence suggests that serious complications do not differ between children treated with either antibiotics or placebo. Immediate antibiotics versus expectant observation We included six trials (1556 children) from high-income countries. The evidence suggests that immediate antibiotics may result in a reduction of pain at two to three days (RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.79; NNTB 8; 1 trial, 396 children; low-certainty evidence), but probably do not reduce the risk of pain at three to seven days (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.12; 4 trials, 959 children; moderate-certainty evidence), and may not reduce the risk of pain at 11 to 14 days (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.10; 1 trial, 247 children; low-certainty evidence). Immediate antibiotics increase the risk of vomiting, diarrhoea or rash (RR 1.87, 95% CI 1.39 to 2.51; NNTH 10; 3 trials, 946 children; high-certainty evidence). Immediate antibiotics probably do not reduce the proportion of children with abnormal tympanometry findings at four weeks and evidence suggests that immediate antibiotics may not reduce the risk of tympanic membrane perforation and AOM recurrences. No serious complications occurred in either group.

Authors' Conclusions

This review reveals that antibiotics probably have no effect on pain at 24 hours, a slight effect on pain in the days following and only a modest effect on the number of children with tympanic perforations, contralateral otitis episodes and abnormal tympanometry findings at two to four weeks compared with placebo in children with AOM. In high-income countries, most cases of AOM spontaneously remit without complications. The benefits of antibiotics must be weighed against the possible harms: for every 14 children treated with antibiotics, one child experienced an adverse event (such as vomiting, diarrhoea or rash) that would not have occurred if antibiotics were withheld. For most children with mild disease in high-income countries, an expectant observational approach seems justified. Therefore, clinical management should emphasise advice about adequate analgesia and the limited role for antibiotics.

### The diagnosis and management of acute otitis media [^dd7863e9]. Pediatrics (2013). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis media (AOM) initial management — Table 4 lists age-, severity-, otorrhea-, and laterality-based options: for "6 mo to 2 y," otorrhea with AOM, unilateral or bilateral AOM with severe symptoms, and bilateral AOM without otorrhea are "Antibiotic therapy," whereas unilateral AOM without otorrhea allows "Antibiotic therapy or additional observation"; for " ≥ 2 y," otorrhea with AOM and unilateral or bilateral AOM with severe symptoms are "Antibiotic therapy," while bilateral AOM without otorrhea and unilateral AOM without otorrhea allow "Antibiotic therapy or additional observation." These recommendations "apply only to children with well-documented AOM with high certainty of diagnosis," define severe features including "persistent otalgia more than 48 h" and "temperature ≥ 39°C (102.2°F) in the past 48 h," and emphasize shared decision-making with a safety net: "If observation is offered, a mechanism must be in place to ensure follow-up and begin antibiotics if the child worsens or fails to improve within 48 to 72 h of AOM onset."

### Pediatric acute otitis media: the case for delayed antibiotic treatment [^564023c4]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Acute otitis media (AOM) is both a commonly diagnosed condition and a frequent indication for antibiotic use in children. Recent literature suggests that antibiotics are not needed in many children with AOM, as most cases resolve spontaneously without complication. However, a majority of AOM infections in children are still treated with antibiotics. The American Academy of Pediatrics and American Academy of Family Physicians released a guideline for treatment of AOM in children. We review the guideline as well as scientific evidence related to AOM treatment options. We support a set of evidence-based guidelines employing a delayed prescription option for antibiotic therapy in selected children. If used appropriately, these cost-effective guidelines will reduce the amount of antibiotics prescribed, increase parental satisfaction, and may lower rates of antibiotic resistance while producing similar rates of resolution of AOM.

### Large dosage amoxicillin / clavulanate, compared with azithromycin, for the treatment of bacterial acute otitis media in children [^da7ce6c1]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2005). Low credibility.

Background

A large dosage pediatric formulation of amoxicillin/clavulanate with an improved pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic profile was developed to eradicate many penicillin-resistant strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae (including beta-lactamase-producing strains).

Methods

This randomized, investigator-blinded, multicenter trial examined treatment of bacterial acute otitis media (AOM) in children 6–30 months of age with amoxicillin/clavulanate (90/6.4 mg/kg/d in 2 divided doses for 10 days) versus azithromycin (10 mg/kg for 1 day followed by 5 mg/kg/d for 4 days). Tympanocentesis was performed at entry for bacteriologic assessment, at the on-therapy visit (day 4–6) to determine bacterial eradication and at any time before the end-of-therapy visit (day 12–14) if the child was categorized as experiencing clinical failure. Clinical assessments were performed at the on-therapy, end-of-therapy and follow-up (day 21–25) visits.

Results

We enrolled 730 children; AOM pathogens were isolated at baseline for 249 of the amoxicillin/clavulanate group and 245 of the azithromycin group. For children with AOM pathogens at baseline, clinical success rates at the end-of-therapy visit were 90.5% for amoxicillin/clavulanate versus 80.9% for azithromycin (P < 0.01), and those at the on-therapy and follow-up visits were 94.9% versus 88.0% and 80.3% versus 71.1%, respectively (all P < 0.05). At the on-therapy visit, pretherapy pathogens were eradicated for 94.2% of children receiving amoxicillin/clavulanate versus 70.3% of those receiving azithromycin (P < 0.001). Amoxicillin/clavulanate eradicated 96.0% of S. pneumoniae (92.0% of fully penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae) and 89.7% of H. influenzae (85.7% [6 of 7 cases] of beta-lactamase-positive H. influenzae). Corresponding rates for azithromycin were 80.4% (54.5%) for S. pneumoniae and 49.1% (100% [1 of 1 case]) for H. influenzae (all P < 0.01 for between-drug comparisons).

Conclusion

Amoxicillin/clavulanate was clinically and bacteriologically more effective than azithromycin among children with bacterial AOM, including cases caused by penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae and beta-lactamase-positive H. influenzae.

### Diagnosis and treatment of otitis media [^1ec2db64]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

Diagnostic criteria for acute otitis media include rapid onset of symptoms, middle ear effusion, and signs and symptoms of middle ear inflammation. Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis are the most common bacterial isolates from the middle ear fluid of children with acute otitis media. Fever, otalgia, headache, irritability, cough, rhinitis, listlessness, anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea, and pulling at the ears are common, but nonspecific symptoms. Detection of middle ear effusion by pneumatic otoscopy is key in establishing the diagnosis. Observation is an acceptable option in healthy children with mild symptoms. Antibiotics are recommended in all children younger than six months, in those between six months and two years if the diagnosis is certain, and in children with severe infection. High-dosage amoxicillin (80 to 90 mg per kg per day) is recommended as first-line therapy. Macrolide antibiotics, clindamycin, and cephalosporins are alternatives in penicillin-sensitive children and in those with resistant infections. Patients who do not respond to treatment should be reassessed. Hearing and language testing is recommended in children with suspected hearing loss or persistent effusion for at least three months, and in those with developmental problems.

### Management of recurrent and persistent acute otitis media: new options with familiar antibiotics [^f970ffc4]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2004). Low credibility.

Recurrent and persistent acute otitis media (AOM) is a common problem, affecting close to 20% of children in their first years of life. It presents a therapeutic challenge to physicians, particularly as beta-lactamase-producing Haemophilus influenzae, as well as penicillin- and, more recently, macrolide-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae are often responsible for AOM in these patients. Intramuscular ceftriaxone (50 mg/kg, once daily for 3 days) has been shown to be effective in treating nonresponsive AOM, but there have been relatively few clinical trials exploring oral antibiotic regimens. Higher doses of commonly used antibiotics (amoxicillin-clavulanate ratio, 14:1 ratio and azithromycin 60 mg/kg divided into three equal once daily doses) have demonstrated high rates of clinical success. These studies will be discussed together with a review of the clinical and microbiologic characteristics of this disease. We will also address the impact that the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine may have on the microbiology of recurrent and persistent AOM.

### The diagnosis and management of acute otitis media [^4867d092]. Pediatrics (2013). Medium credibility.

Initial antibiotic therapy for acute otitis media — microbiology and effect sizes indicate benefit: tympanocentesis cultures showed 55% with bacteria only and 15% with bacteria and virus; a meta-analysis reported a 14% increase in absolute rates of clinical improvement, and systematic reviews before 2011 found increases of 6% to 12% with initial antibiotics. Trials using stringent diagnostic criteria in young children showed differences in clinical improvement of 26% to 35% favoring antibiotics, with greater benefit for bilateral AOM or AOM with otorrhea; antibiotic therapy also decreased duration of pain, analgesic use, or school absence and parent days missed from work. Children younger than 2 years may take longer to improve and are more likely to benefit, yet many cases resolve without antibiotics, and a clinically significant benefit is observed for bilateral AOM, Streptococcus pneumoniae infection, or AOM with otorrhea.

### Clinical outcomes associated with amoxicillin treatment for acute otitis media in children [^6cda2b31]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute otitis media (AOM) is the most common reason children are prescribed antibiotics. Bacteria that produce beta-lactamase are an increasingly frequent cause of AOM and may be resistant to amoxicillin, the currently recommended treatment for AOM. We aimed to evaluate the clinical outcomes of children treated with amoxicillin for AOM and assessed whether outcomes vary by infecting pathogen or beta-lactamase production.

Methods

205 children 6–35 months old diagnosed with AOM and prescribed amoxicillin were included. Bacterial culture and qualitative multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction were performed on nasopharyngeal swabs collected at enrollment. Parents completed surveys assessing symptoms, antibiotic adherence, and potential adverse events. The primary outcome was treatment failure with amoxicillin. Secondary outcomes included recurrence, symptom improvement, resolution, and adverse drug events (ADE).

Results

8 children (5.4%) experienced treatment failure and 14 (6.8%) had recurrence. By day 5, 152 (74.1%) children had symptom improvement and 97 (47.3%) had resolution. Parents reported ADE for 56 (27.3%) children. Among 149 children who did not take any amoxicillin before enrollment, 98 (65.8%) had one or more beta-lactamase-producing bacteria. Common bacterial otopathogens were Moraxella catarrhalis (79, 53.0%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (51, 34.2%), Haemophilus influenzae (30, 20.1%), and Staphylococcus aureus (21, 14.1%). Treatment failure did not differ between children that did (5, 5.1%) and did not (3, 5.9%) have beta-lactamase-producing otopathogens (p = .05).

Conclusions

Among children diagnosed with AOM treated with amoxicillin, treatment failure was uncommon and did not differ by pathogen or beta-lactamase production. These data support guidance recommending amoxicillin despite an increasing prevalence of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria.

### Diagnosis and treatment of acute otitis media: an assessment [^c2132c26]. Pediatrics (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess compliance with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) evidence-based guidelines for the judicious use of antimicrobials in children with acute otitis media (AOM).

Methods

Compliance with CDC's recommended diagnostic criteria and antimicrobial treatments for management of AOM was assessed by chart review and self-report for 29 community pediatricians in St. Louis, Missouri. For each physician, a simple random sample of AOM visits was selected and reviewed by trained reviewers. In addition, each physician completed a questionnaire.

Results

Compliance with recommended diagnostic criteria was 38% (95% confidence interval: 34%-42%; n = 573) by chart audit and 41% (95% confidence interval: 24%-61%; n = 29) by self-report. Antimicrobial selection assessed by chart audit was consistent with CDC guidelines in 68% (95% confidence interval: 64%-72%) of visits for a new infection, 63% (95% confidence interval: 47%-78%) of visits for treatment failure, and 50% (95% confidence interval: 33%-67%) for recurrent disease. Self-reported compliance with treatment guidelines for new infection was 100% (95% confidence interval: 88%-100%) and 83% (95% confidence interval: 64%-94%) for treatment failure. Noncompliance was most frequently attributable to overuse of broad-spectrum antimicrobials. Most patients treated with amoxicillin received a 10-day course (98%). Subtherapeutic dosing occurred in 26% of patients treated with amoxicillin.

Conclusions

Overdiagnosis of AOM is common. Efforts to improve the judicious use of antimicrobials for AOM should focus on improving diagnostic accuracy, limiting the use of broad-spectrum antimicrobials to cases where they offer clinical benefit, and ensuring that amoxicillin dosing regimens are optimal.

The American Academy of Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery Foundation (AAO-HNSF) has published a supplement to this issue featuring the updated Clinical Practice Guideline: Acute Otitis Externa, as a supplement to Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery. To assist in implementing the guideline recommendations, this article summarizes the rationale, purpose, and key action statements. The 8 recommendations developed address appropriate diagnosis of acute otitis externa (AOE) and the use of oral and topical antimicrobials and highlight the need for adequate pain relief. An updated guideline is needed due to new clinical trials, new systematic reviews, and the lack of consumer participation in the initial guideline development group.

### Azithromycin [^ad8da2bd]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Efficacy using azithromycin given over 3 days (10 mg/kg/day).

Trial 4

In a double-blind, controlled, randomized clinical study of acute otitis media in pediatric patients from 6 months to 12 years of age, azithromycin (10 mg/kg per day for 3 days) was compared to amoxicillin/clavulanate potassium (7:1) in divided doses q12h for 10 days. Each patient received active drug and placebo matched for the comparator.

For the 366 patients who were evaluated for clinical efficacy at the Day 12 visit, the clinical success rate (i.e., cure plus improvement) was 83% for azithromycin and 88% for the control agent. For the 362 patients who were evaluated at the Days 24 to 28 visits, the clinical success rate was 74% for azithromycin and 69% for the control agent.

Efficacy using azithromycin 30 mg/kg given as a single dose

Trial 5

A double-blind, controlled, randomized trial was performed at nine clinical centers. Pediatric patients from 6 months to 12 years of age were randomized 1:1 to treatment with either azithromycin (given at 30 mg/kg as a single dose on Day 1) or amoxicillin/clavulanate potassium (7:1), divided q12h for 10 days. Each child received active drug, and placebo matched for the comparator.

Clinical response (Cure, Improvement, Failure) was evaluated at End of Therapy (Days 12 to 16) and Test of Cure (Days 28 to 32). Safety was evaluated throughout the trial for all treated subjects. For the 321 subjects who were evaluated at End of Treatment, the clinical success rate (cure plus improvement) was 87% for azithromycin, and 88% for the comparator. For the 305 subjects who were evaluated at Test of Cure, the clinical success rate was 75% for both azithromycin and the comparator.

Trial 6

In a non-comparative clinical and microbiological trial, 248 patients from 6 months to 12 years of age with documented acute otitis media were dosed with a single oral dose of azithromycin (30 mg/kg on Day 1).

For the 240 patients who were evaluable for clinical modified Intent-to-Treat (MITT) analysis, the clinical success rate (i.e., cure plus improvement) at Day 10 was 89% and for the 242 patients evaluable at Days 24 to 28, the clinical success rate (cure) was 85%.

### The diagnosis and management of acute otitis media [^3af87a40]. Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

This evidence-based clinical practice guideline is a revision of the 2004 acute otitis media (AOM) guideline from the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and American Academy of Family Physicians. It provides recommendations to primary care clinicians for the management of children from 6 months through 12 years of age with uncomplicated AOM. In 2009, the AAP convened a committee composed of primary care physicians and experts in the fields of pediatrics, family practice, otolaryngology, epidemiology, infectious disease, emergency medicine, and guideline methodology. The subcommittee partnered with the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and the Southern California Evidence-Based Practice Center to develop a comprehensive review of the new literature related to AOM since the initial evidence report of 2000. The resulting evidence report and other sources of data were used to formulate the practice guideline recommendations. The focus of this practice guideline is the appropriate diagnosis and initial treatment of a child presenting with AOM. The guideline provides a specific, stringent definition of AOM. It addresses pain management, initial observation versus antibiotic treatment, appropriate choices of antibiotic agents, and preventive measures. It also addresses recurrent AOM, which was not included in the 2004 guideline. Decisions were made on the basis of a systematic grading of the quality of evidence and benefit-harm relationships. The practice guideline underwent comprehensive peer review before formal approval by the AAP. This clinical practice guideline is not intended as a sole source of guidance in the management of children with AOM. Rather, it is intended to assist primary care clinicians by providing a framework for clinical decision-making. It is not intended to replace clinical judgment or establish a protocol for all children with this condition. These recommendations may not provide the only appropriate approach to the management of this problem.

### The clinical course of acute otitis media in high-risk Australian aboriginal children: a longitudinal study [^1c914c3b]. BMC Pediatrics (2005). Low credibility.

Antibiotic treatment

Six children were known to be receiving antibiotics effective against respiratory pathogens at the time of the initial AOM diagnosis (amoxicillin 50 mg/kg/day). All the other children had received antibiotics for otitis media in the past but the time since their last treatment was not recorded. Following diagnosis, antibiotic treatment was started in an additional 22 children. Two of the three children not treated initially developed moderate bulging of the TM and started treatment on day 6–8 (A31 and A32). One child (A19) did not receive any antibiotics. The antibiotics prescribed were twice daily amoxicillin (25), amoxicillin-clavulanate (1), trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole (3), or daily intramuscular procaine penicillin (1). The mean dose of penicillin or amoxicillin was 52 mg/kg/day (standard deviation 15, range 25–100). Recommended treatment duration was at least 7 days for AOM without perforation and at least 14 days for AOM with perforation. Compliance with prescribed treatment was poor. Overall, we documented 462/1151 prescribed doses (40%) as taken, and estimated that 17/30 participants (57%) took less than half their recommended treatment.

### Current approaches to otitis media [^20f99aab]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

Acute otitis media is the most commonly diagnosed illness in children, and is one of the most common reasons for antibiotic prescription. In many countries, antibiotic resistance is increasing among the bacteria that are implicated in acute otitis media, particularly Streptococcus pneumoniae. This evolution should stimulate changes in the management of acute otitis media, particularly the following: improvement in diagnostic accuracy; reduction in antibiotic use; selection of the most appropriate drugs at the appropriate dosage; reduction in duration of treatment, when possible; and implementation of new vaccines.

### Management of acute otitis media by primary care physicians: trends since the release of the 2004 American Academy of Pediatrics / American Academy of Family Physicians clinical practice guideline [^52eb480d]. Pediatrics (2007). Low credibility.

Objectives

In 2004, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Academy of Family Physicians released a clinical practice guideline on the management of acute otitis media that included endorsement of an observation option for selected cases and recommendations of specific antibiotics. We sought to describe primary care physicians' current management of acute otitis media to compare it with the guideline's recommendations and describe trends since 2004.

Design

We used a mail survey from March through June 2006 within the Slone Center Office-Based Research Network, a national practice-based pediatric research network.

Results

The response rate was 299 (62.7%) of 477. The observation option was considered reasonable by 83.3%, compared with 88.0% in 2004, and was used in a median of 15% of acute otitis media cases over the previous 3 months. The most common physician-identified barriers to the use of the observation option were parental reluctance (83.5%) and the cost and difficulty of follow-up of children who do not improve (30.9%). In terms of antibiotic choices for acute otitis media, agreement with the guideline's antibiotic recommendation for 4 common clinical scenarios was as follows: high-dose amoxicillin for acute otitis media with nonsevere symptoms (57.2%), high-dose amoxicillin-clavulanate for acute otitis media with severe symptoms (12.7%), high-dose amoxicillin-clavulanate for cases that failed to respond to amoxicillin (42.8%), and intramuscular ceftriaxone for cases that failed to respond to treatment with amoxicillin-clavulanate (16.7%). Each of these proportions declined from 2004.

Conclusions

Most primary care physicians accept the concept of an observation option for acute otitis media but use it only occasionally. Antibiotics prescribed for acute otitis media differ markedly from the guideline's recommendations, and the difference has increased since 2004.

Acute otitis media (AOM) management terminology — Key terms are defined for consistent use: "Otitis externa — an infection of the external auditory canal," "Tympanometry — measuring acoustic immittance (transfer of acoustic energy) of the ear as a function of ear canal air pressure," and "Number needed to treat (NNT) — the number of patients who need to be treated to prevent 1 additional bad outcome." Initial antibiotic therapy is defined as "treatment of AOM with antibiotics that are prescribed at the time of diagnosis with the intent of starting antibiotic therapy as soon as possible after the encounter," whereas initial observation is "initial management of AOM limited to symptomatic relief, with commencement of antibiotic therapy only if the child's condition worsens at any time or does not show clinical improvement within 48 to 72 hours of diagnosis; a mechanism must be in place to ensure follow-up and initiation of antibiotics if the child fails observation."

Acute otitis media — alternative initial antibiotics and comparative in vitro activity: Alternative initial antibiotics include cefdinir (14 mg/kg per day in 1 or 2 doses), cefuroxime (30 mg/kg per day in 2 divided doses), cefpodoxime (10 mg/kg per day in 2 divided doses), or ceftriaxone (50 mg/kg, administered intramuscularly). Alternative antibiotics vary in their efficacy against AOM pathogens, with in vitro susceptibility of Streptococcus pneumoniae to cefdinir and cefuroxime 70% to 80% compared with 84% to 92% for amoxicillin, and in vitro efficacy against Haemophilus influenzae approximately 98% for cefdinir and cefuroxime compared with 58% for amoxicillin and nearly 100% for amoxicillin-clavulanate; additionally, cefdinir, cefuroxime, cefpodoxime, and ceftriaxone are highly unlikely to be associated with cross-reactivity with penicillin allergy.

### Cefdinir vs. amoxicillin / clavulanic acid in the treatment of suppurative acute otitis media in children [^89ae64cc]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2000). Low credibility.

An investigator-blinded, randomized, multicenter study was conducted to compare the efficacy and safety of cefdinir and amoxicillin/ clavulanate (amoxicillin/CA) in the treatment of pediatric patients with acute suppurative otitis media. Patients 6 months to 12 years of age were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive cefdinir 14 mg/kg once-daily, cefdinir 7 mg/kg b.i.d., or amoxicillin/CA 13.3 mg/kg t.i.d. Test-of-cure was determined 11 to 16 days posttherapy. Of the 752 patients who entered the study, 665 (88%) completed treatment and 595 (79%) were evaluable. Response rates in the three treatment groups were similar. Overall rates of adverse events were statistically lower in the cefdinir once-daily group than in the amoxicillin/CA group. Diarrhea was the most common adverse event in all treatment groups. Cefdinir given either once-daily or twice-daily is a safe and effective treatment for pediatric patients with acute suppurative otitis media.

Changes from AAP/AAFP 2004 AOM guideline — despite new data on the effect of PCV7 and updated data on in vitro susceptibility of bacterial pathogens most likely to cause AOM, the recommendations for the first-line antibiotic remains unchanged from 2004; the current guideline contains revised recommendations regarding penicillin allergy based on new data, and the increase of multidrug-resistant strains of pneumococci is noted.

Objective

To review the 2004 treatment guidelines provided by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) regarding the treatment of otitis media in pediatric patients.

Data Sources

A MEDLINE search, restricted to English-language articles about pediatric patients, was conducted (1966-May 2005) using the key words acute otitis media (AOM), guideline, observation therapy, and vaccination. Additional references were located through review of the bibliographies of cited articles.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Studies related to the fundamental basis of the updated guidelines and articles addressing current issues related to otitis media infection were included.

Data Synthesis

Otitis media affects many children in the US. Concerns have been raised about the proper treatment of AOM in the face of increasing drug resistance among primary pathogens responsible for infection. Some countries have chosen to observe patients for a designated period of time prior to initiation of antibiotic therapy. The AAP and AAFP have updated the treatment guidelines for otitis media to include the option of observation therapy, recommendations for dosing of various antibiotic regimens and their place in therapy, and the importance of initial pain management.

Conclusions

Updated treatment guidelines for otitis media have been developed in an effort to properly treat children while decreasing current resistance rates for common organisms that cause AOM. In the future, the therapeutic outcomes of observation therapy related to both the incidence of drug resistance and the possibility of increased complications related to otitis media will need to be evaluated in the US.
