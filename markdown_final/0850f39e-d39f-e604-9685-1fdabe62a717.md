## Question

Work up syncope

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how to work up syncope. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming true syncope and excluding mimics. Then, I should verify the core initial evaluation elements and their diagnostic yield. Next, I will risk-stratify to decide disposition. After that, I need to check which additional tests are indicated based on suspected etiologies, and which to avoid. Finally, I will consider special populations, follow-up, and documentation, and I will double-check where guidelines differ and why.

> Let me first confirm the definition and exclude mimics, because misclassification here derails the entire workup. True syncope is transient loss of consciousness due to cerebral hypoperfusion, with rapid onset, brief duration, spontaneous complete recovery, and loss of postural tone; if any of these are absent, I should consider seizures, psychogenic pseudosyncope, hypoglycemia, intoxication, or other non-syncopal causes before proceeding with a syncope evaluation.

> Wait, let me verify the core initial evaluation elements and their yield. The foundation is a detailed history, physical examination including orthostatic vitals, and a 12-lead ECG; this establishes the diagnosis in roughly 23–50% of patients and enables immediate risk stratification, so I should not skip these steps or substitute them with broad panels or imaging up front [^4b97a78b] [^417bb6a2] [^bb74f1d6].

> I need to ensure the history captures the essentials: circumstances before, during, and after the event; prodrome; position; triggers; medication and substance use; family history of SCD; and prior episodes. I should also ask about palpitations, chest pain, dyspnea, and exertional features, and I should obtain a bystander account whenever possible because it improves diagnostic accuracy and risk assessment [^4b97a78b] [^6a8cfa38].

> Hold on, I should verify the physical exam priorities. Orthostatic blood pressure and heart rate measurements are critical; classic orthostatic hypotension is a sustained drop in systolic BP of at least 20 mm Hg or diastolic BP of at least 10 mm Hg within 3 minutes of standing, and delayed OH may present after 3 minutes, so I should measure at 1, 3, and 10 minutes when feasible. I also need to check for murmurs, gallops, and focal neurologic deficits, and in older adults I should maintain a low threshold for multifactorial etiologies and medication contributors [^df2f9663] [^6cc4c3a6] [^a489ef59].

> Next, I should review the ECG carefully. Although the ECG yields a specific diagnosis in only about 5% initially, abnormal findings such as conduction disease, ischemia, LVH, or arrhythmias increase risk of adverse outcomes and guide further testing; thus, I should not omit the ECG and should interpret it in the context of pretest probability rather than in isolation [^42004b1a] [^fe2efcac] [^bb74f1d6].

> I will now examine risk stratification to decide disposition. High-risk features warrant inpatient evaluation and include structural heart disease, abnormal ECG, syncope during exertion or while supine, hemodynamic instability, heart failure, known CAD, or concerning family history; low-risk features consistent with reflex syncope without red flags support outpatient management; intermediate-risk patients may benefit from structured ED observation protocols to reduce unnecessary admissions, and I should remember that no single risk score reliably outperforms clinical judgment in all settings [^3c90aeac] [^56c7222a] [^d914dc7f] [^201995dc].

> But wait, what if I overcall risk and admit everyone? I should double-check the evidence: hospitalization for undifferentiated syncope without serious conditions has not consistently improved outcomes, and structured ED observation can safely reduce admissions without increasing adverse events in appropriately selected intermediate-risk patients, so I should individualize disposition rather than default to admission [^b24472c2] [^d914dc7f].

> Next, I should review additional testing only when indicated by the initial evaluation. If reflex syncope is suspected and the diagnosis remains uncertain, tilt-table testing can be useful; if orthostatic hypotension is suspected, targeted labs and autonomic evaluation may help; if cardiac syncope is suspected, I should select ambulatory ECG monitoring based on symptom frequency and consider echocardiography, stress testing, or electrophysiology study when appropriate; I need to ensure I do not order routine broad labs, neuroimaging, or cardiac imaging in the absence of supporting clinical suspicion [^c7ff5181] [^d8a2ac6b] [^da23ffbf] [^3ecfdd6b] [^0793ca5c].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of echocardiography. Transthoracic echocardiography is reasonable when structural heart disease is suspected from history, exam, or ECG, but routine echo in low-risk patients has low diagnostic yield and should be avoided; similarly, CT or MRI is reserved for selected cases where a specific cardiac etiology is suspected, not for routine screening [^d5e253a4] [^c8acc08f] [^fb4c15b4].

> I need to check ambulatory ECG monitoring selection. Holter is suitable for frequent daily symptoms, external loop or patch monitors for weekly symptoms, and implantable cardiac monitors for infrequent, recurrent unexplained syncope after a nondiagnostic workup; I should align monitor choice with symptom periodicity to maximize diagnostic yield [^f59938a0] [^d5396bdd].

> Let me consider special populations. In older adults, syncope is often multifactorial and carries higher risk, so I should maintain a low threshold for inpatient evaluation, medication review, and multidisciplinary care; in pediatrics, vasovagal syncope predominates, but exertional syncope, abnormal exam, or abnormal ECG should prompt evaluation for cardiac causes; in patients with trauma, I should prioritize stabilization and defer orthostatics if immobilization precludes them, revisiting autonomic assessment when safe [^6cc4c3a6] [^94ea9b5b] [^52dbfa8a] [^a16d3f2c].

> I should confirm follow-up and safety netting. For low-risk patients discharged home, I need to provide return precautions, activity counseling, and arrange timely follow-up, ideally in a syncope clinic when available; for intermediate-risk patients, structured observation or expedited specialty referral can reduce admissions and improve diagnostic efficiency, and I should document the rationale for disposition and the plan for recurrence [^3c90aeac] [^b9b0b8ff] [^be962417].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought routine labs might help screen for occult causes, but I should correct that. Routine comprehensive laboratory testing has low yield and is not recommended; instead, I should order targeted tests only when suggested by the clinical assessment, such as electrolytes in suspected arrhythmias or endocrine etiologies, or troponin when myocardial ischemia is suspected [^3ecfdd6b] [^a0820fc0].

> Let me reconsider the overall algorithm to ensure internal consistency. Start with history, exam, and ECG; classify as high, intermediate, or low risk; manage high-risk patients in hospital; manage low-risk reflex or orthostatic cases outpatient; use structured observation or expedited testing for intermediate-risk patients; and tailor additional tests to suspected etiologies rather than ordering broad panels or imaging indiscriminately, aligning with ACC/AHA/HRS and ESC guidance [^7ea1c47b] [^be962417].

The workup of syncope centers on **history, physical exam, and ECG** [^417bb6a2] to distinguish benign from dangerous causes and guide testing [^6a8cfa38]. Most patients have reflex or orthostatic syncope, but **cardiac causes carry higher risk** and warrant inpatient evaluation when suspected [^7396cc1d] [^3c90aeac]. Use risk stratification tools (e.g. SFSR, OESIL, CSRS) to decide disposition, and reserve advanced testing — echocardiography, ambulatory ECG, tilt testing, or electrophysiology — for selected cases based on initial findings [^201995dc] [^d5e253a4] [^f59938a0] [^c7ff5181] [^3630d79b]. Avoid routine labs and imaging unless clinically indicated, and tailor the workup to the patient's risk profile and presentation [^3ecfdd6b] [^0793ca5c].

## Initial evaluation

### History and physical examination

History should cover **event details** (prodrome, position, triggers, duration, recovery), medical history (heart disease, arrhythmias, diabetes, neurologic disease), medications (antihypertensives, antiarrhythmics, diuretics, antidepressants), and family history (sudden cardiac death, cardiomyopathy) [^4b97a78b]. The physical examination should include **orthostatic vitals** (supine and standing BP/HR), a cardiovascular exam (murmurs, gallops, irregular rhythm), and a neurologic exam (focal deficits) [^4b97a78b].

---

### Electrocardiogram (ECG)

A 12-lead ECG is **mandatory for all patients** to detect arrhythmias, conduction disease, ischemia, or structural heart disease [^417bb6a2] [^8aa4eb5e]. Abnormal ECG findings increase the risk of cardiac syncope and guide further testing [^42004b1a].

---

## Risk stratification

Risk stratification determines disposition and testing. Several **clinical decision rules** exist, but none replace clinical judgment [^201995dc]:

| **Risk tool** | **Key features** | **Outcome** |
|-|-|-|
| San Francisco Syncope Rule (SFSR) | - CHF <br/> - Hematocrit < 30% <br/> - Abnormal ECG <br/> - Shortness of breath <br/> - Systolic BP < 90 mmHg | Predicts 7-day serious outcomes |
| OESIL score | - Age > 65 <br/> - Cardiovascular disease <br/> - Abnormal ECG <br/> - Syncope without prodrome | Predicts 1-year mortality |
| Canadian Syncope Risk Score (CSRS) | - Age <br/> - Sex <br/> - ECG <br/> - Troponin <br/> - History <br/> - Vitals | Predicts 30-day serious outcomes |

---

High-risk features warrant **admission and expedited cardiac evaluation** (e.g. structural heart disease, abnormal ECG, exertional syncope, family history of SCD) [^3c90aeac]. Low-risk patients with reflex or orthostatic syncope can be discharged with education and follow-up [^72708e03].

---

## Indications for further diagnostic testing

Testing is guided by **initial findings and risk**:

- **Echocardiography**: Suspected structural heart disease (murmurs, abnormal ECG, heart failure) [^d5e253a4].
- **Ambulatory ECG monitoring**: Suspected arrhythmias (palpitations, abnormal ECG, intermittent symptoms) [^f59938a0].
- **Tilt-table testing**: Suspected reflex syncope or delayed orthostatic hypotension after inconclusive initial evaluation [^c7ff5181] [^d8a2ac6b].
- **Electrophysiology study (EPS)**: Suspected arrhythmogenic substrate (e.g. conduction disease, prior MI) [^3630d79b].

---

## Common etiologies and diagnostic approach

| **Category** | **Examples** | **Diagnostic approach** |
|-|-|-|
| Reflex syncope | - Vasovagal <br/> - Carotid sinus hypersensitivity | - History <br/> - Exam <br/> - ECG <br/> - Tilt testing if needed [^c7ff5181] |
| Orthostatic hypotension | - Volume depletion <br/> - Autonomic failure <br/> - Medications | - Orthostatic vitals <br/> - Medication review <br/> - Autonomic testing if indicated [^a2ad1552] |
| Cardiac syncope | - Arrhythmias <br/> - Structural heart disease <br/> - Ischemia | - ECG <br/> - Echocardiography <br/> - Ambulatory ECG <br/> - Stress testing <br/> - EPS if indicated [^d5e253a4] [^f59938a0] [^3630d79b] |

---

## Special populations

- **Elderly**: Multifactorial etiologies, higher risk; prioritize orthostatic vitals, medication review, and echocardiography [^6cc4c3a6] [^94ea9b5b].
- **Pediatrics**: Most cases are benign (vasovagal); evaluate for cardiac causes if exertional, no prodrome, or abnormal ECG [^52dbfa8e].
- **Pregnant patients**: Consider orthostatic hypotension, vena caval compression, and cardiomyopathy.

---

## Avoiding unnecessary testing

Routine laboratory tests, neuroimaging, and broad cardiac imaging are **low yield** and should be avoided unless clinically indicated [^3ecfdd6b] [^0793ca5c]. This approach reduces costs and false positives.

---

## Follow-up and patient education

Provide **clear return precautions**, education on triggers, hydration, and medication adherence. Arrange follow-up with primary care or cardiology, and consider referral to a syncope clinic for recurrent or unexplained cases [^b9b0b8ff].

---

The workup of syncope relies on **history, exam, and ECG**, with risk stratification guiding disposition and selective testing. This approach balances diagnostic yield, safety, and resource use.

### Selecting appropriate diagnostic tools for evaluating the patient with syncope / collapse [^6a8cfa38]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

The investigation of syncope is challenging and physicians have an ever-increasing array of diagnostic tools at their disposal. There are two essential goals that drive investigation: risk stratification and identification of etiology. In this review, we outline our approach while providing a synopsis of the available supportive evidence. The key to syncope is in the story as told by the patient and a bystander, since this drives both risk assessment and diagnostic testing. All patients should initially be evaluated with a systematic history and physical examination as well as an ECG. The initial evaluation provides an estimation of risk and directs whether inpatient or outpatient evaluation is appropriate. In a substantial proportion of patients, the etiology will be evident after initial evaluation and no further investigation is required. In the remaining, targeted use of additional investigations in the form of cardiac imaging, provocative testing and/or ambulatory ECG monitoring should be performed. A thoughtful and systematic approach to the investigation of syncope optimizes the diagnostic yield but also ensures efficient usage of limited health care resources.

### Syncope risk assessment in the emergency department and clinic [^00d8966a]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

The initial assessment of patients who present with presumed syncope is challenging. Syncope has many possible causes ranging from relatively benign to potentially life-threatening, and sorting through the possibilities may not be feasible given time limitations in an urgent care setting. Therefore, the physician almost always must determine whether the affected individual needs in-hospital evaluation or can be safely referred to an outpatient syncope evaluation clinic. In instances when the etiology of syncope has been diagnosed with confidence at the initial clinical evaluation, the hospitalization question is readily addressed and the appropriateness of hospitalization versus timely outpatient evaluation (preferably in a dedicated syncope management clinic) is clear. In those cases in which the diagnosis is uncertain, risk stratification schemes such as those summarized in this communication become more essential. However, at present no single risk assessment protocol appears to be satisfactory for universal application. The development of a consensus recommendation is an essential next step.

Outpatient management for suspected cardiac syncope — It may be reasonable to manage selected patients with suspected cardiac syncope in the outpatient setting in the absence of serious medical conditions. Hospital-based evaluation of syncope of unclear cause, in the absence of other serious identified medical conditions, has not demonstrated an improvement in patient-relevant outcomes, and several observational studies suggest modest diagnostic yield of hospital admission. Patients evaluated for suspected cardiac syncope in outpatient settings are seldom admitted for diagnostic purposes, it may be reasonable to extend a similar approach to emergency departments (EDs) after initial evaluation is completed in the ED, and primary providers can consider expedited referral to specialists with expertise in syncope as an alternative to extended hospital-based evaluation.

Initial evaluation, diagnosis, and risk stratification — syncope: The initial evaluation of a patient presenting with T-LOC consists of "careful history, physical examination, including orthostatic BP measurements, and electrocardiogram (ECG)". Based on these findings, additional examinations "may be performed", including "CSM in patients > 40 years", echocardiogram "when there is previous known heart disease or data suggestive of structural heart disease or syncope secondary to cardiovascular cause", "Immediate ECG monitoring when there is a suspicion of arrhythmic syncope", and "Orthostatic challenge (lying-to-standing orthostatic test and/or head-up tilt testing) when syncope is related to the standing position or there is a suspicion of a reflex mechanism"; "Other less specific tests such as neurological evaluation or blood tests are only indicated when there is suspicion of non-syncopal T-LOC". The initial evaluation "should answer three key questions" about whether the event is a syncopal episode, whether "the aetiological diagnosis" is determined, and whether "there are data suggestive of a high risk of cardiovascular events or death". For diagnosis of syncope, the following "should be answered": "Was LOC complete? Was LOC transient with rapid onset and short duration? Did the patient recover spontaneously, completely and without sequelae? Did the patient lose postural tone?" If all are positive there is a "high likelihood of being syncope"; if any are negative, "exclude other forms of LOC before proceeding with syncope evaluation". Initial evaluation "is able to define the cause of syncope in 23–50% of patients".

Syncope — evaluation and diagnosis research needs state that studies are needed to better understand the interaction and relationships among the presenting symptom of syncope, the cause of syncope, the underlying disease condition, and their effect on clinical outcomes. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are needed to develop structured protocols to evaluate patients with syncope who are at intermediate risk without an immediate presumptive diagnosis, and in addition to the endpoints of diagnostic yield and healthcare utilization, relevant clinical endpoints of nonfatal and fatal outcomes and recurrence of syncope are to be included. RCTs are needed to determine the features of syncope-specialized facilities that are necessary to achieve beneficial outcomes for patient care and to improve efficiency and effectiveness of healthcare delivery, and as technology advances, studies are needed to determine the value of new technology in the evaluation and management of patients with syncope.

ACC/AHA/HRS syncope guideline — scope and audience provides guidance on the management of adult and pediatric patients with suspected syncope and is intended to be a practical document for cardiologists, arrhythmia specialists, neurologists, emergency physicians, general internists, geriatric specialists, sports medicine specialists, and other healthcare professionals. It is not a review of physiology, pathophysiology, or mechanisms of underlying conditions associated with syncope, and addresses syncope only as a presenting symptom across numerous conditions. Because of the plausible association of syncope and sudden cardiac death (SCD) in selected populations, the document discusses risk stratification and prevention of SCD when appropriate, and the use of the terms selected populations and selected patients is intended to direct healthcare providers to exercise clinical judgment during evaluation and management.

Initial evaluation timing and setting — The time interval between the index syncopal event and the initial evaluation can vary significantly according to the medical necessity for evaluation and the patient's effort in seeking evaluation. The clinical setting also varies, and the patient could seek evaluation in an outpatient setting with a generalist or a specialist or in the ED at a hospital; these general principles for the initial evaluation are shown in Figure 1, and additional evaluation is discussed according to the outcomes of initial evaluation or in the presence of specific disease conditions.

Disposition after initial evaluation — hospital evaluation and treatment "are recommended" for patients with syncope who have a serious medical condition potentially relevant to the cause identified during initial evaluation. It is reasonable to manage patients with presumptive reflex-mediated syncope in the outpatient setting "in the absence of serious medical conditions". In intermediate-risk patients with an unclear cause of syncope, use of a structured emergency department observation protocol "can be effective in reducing hospital admission". It may be reasonable to manage selected patients with suspected cardiac syncope in the outpatient setting "in the absence of serious medical conditions".

ACC/AHA/HRS syncope guideline — disposition after initial evaluation provides graded recommendations as follows: Hospital evaluation and treatment are recommended for patients presenting with syncope who have a serious medical condition potentially relevant to the cause of syncope identified during initial evaluation (I B-NR). It is reasonable to manage patients with presumptive reflex-mediated syncope in the outpatient setting in the absence of serious medical conditions (IIa C-LD). In intermediate-risk patients with an unclear cause of syncope, use of a structured ED observation protocol can be effective in reducing hospital admission (IIa B-R). It may be reasonable to manage selected patients with suspected cardiac syncope in the outpatient setting in the absence of serious medical conditions (IIb C-LD).

12.3. Evaluation and diagnosis — because patients presenting with syncope are at higher risk for an impending catastrophic event, overuse and inappropriate use of testing and hospital admission are common. Studies are needed to better understand the interaction and relationships among the presenting symptom of syncope, the cause of syncope, the underlying disease condition, and their effect on clinical outcomes. Investigations are needed to understand the key components of clinical characteristics during the initial evaluation and to develop standardization tools to guide the evaluation by healthcare team. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are needed to develop structured protocols to evaluate patients with syncope who are at intermediate risk without an immediate presumptive diagnosis, and relevant clinical endpoints including diagnostic yield, healthcare utilization, nonfatal and fatal outcomes, and recurrence of syncope are to be included. RCTs are needed to determine the features of syncope-specialized facilities that are necessary to achieve beneficial outcomes for patient care and to improve efficiency and effectiveness of healthcare delivery. As technology advances, studies are needed to determine the value of new technology in the evaluation and management of patients with syncope.

### Approach to syncope in the emergency department [^8991073e]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Syncope is a common reason for ED attendance and it presents a major management challenge with regard to the appropriate workup and disposition. Nearly 50% of patients are admitted, and for many this is unnecessary; clinical decision rules have not proven to decrease unnecessary admissions. The European Society of Cardiology has recently developed guidance for managing syncope in the ED. This article highlights the key steps in evaluating syncope in the ED, factors involved in determining risk of a cardiac cause, and considerations for admission, observation or discharge.

Electrophysiological study (EPS) in syncope — The EPS can identify a substrate for clinical bradyarrhythmia or tachyarrhythmia as a potential cause of syncope after a nondiagnostic initial evaluation, but "Despite these purported benefits, EPS has a limited role in the evaluation of syncope, especially in patients without known heart disease or with low suspicion of an arrhythmic etiology". Recommendations state that "EPS can be useful for evaluation of selected patients with syncope of suspected arrhythmic etiology" and that "EPS is not recommended for syncope evaluation in patients with a normal ECG and normal cardiac structure and function, unless an arrhythmic etiology is suspected". Additional notes include that "An EPS is no longer required in patients with syncope before consideration of ICD therapy" and that "The role of EPS in patients with syncope suspected to be due to VA and acquired nonischemic heart disease is unproven".

Management of syncope in the Emergency Department (ED) focuses on risk stratification with clear disposition goals. "The evaluation of syncope in the setting of ED has changed from attempts to make a diagnosis of the cause of syncope to risk stratification (Table 8) in order to:" "(i) recognize patients with life-threatening conditions and admit them to the hospital; (ii) recognize patients with non serious conditions to be discharged and referred later to local syncope facilities; (iii) recognize those who do not need any further evaluation and treatment; and (iv) choose a timing and setting where further diagnostic tests should be performed in patients with inconclusive initial evaluation".

Initial evaluation of patients with syncope — recommendations identify core first-line assessments. A detailed history and physical examination should be performed in patients with syncope (COR I, LOE B-NR). In the initial evaluation of patients with syncope, a resting 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) is useful (COR I, LOE B-NR).

Pediatric syncope — initial evaluation: Vasovagal syncope (VVS) evaluation, including history, exam, family history, and ECG, should be performed for all pediatric patients presenting with syncope, and exertional syncope should heighten concern for a cardiac cause. VVS evaluation, including a detailed medical history, physical examination, family history, and a 12-lead ECG, should be performed in all pediatric patients presenting with syncope. Regardless of symptoms, exertional syncope, especially mid-exertional syncope, should result in a high index of suspicion for a cardiac etiology.

Recommendations for disposition after initial syncope evaluation — classes and levels of evidence: COR I, LOE B-NR — Hospital evaluation and treatment are recommended for patients presenting with syncope who have a serious medical condition potentially relevant to the cause of syncope identified during initial evaluation. COR IIa, LOE C-LD — It is reasonable to manage patients with presumptive reflex-mediated syncope in the outpatient setting in the absence of serious medical conditions. Patients with presumptive vasovagal syncope (VVS) have a long-term risk of death similar to that of risk-matched patients without syncope, and hospital-based evaluation for presumptive VVS is unlikely to improve long-term outcomes, with possible exceptions including frequent recurrent syncope with risk of injury or identified injury related to syncope.

Syncope is a commonly encountered and challenging problem in medical practice. Presentations are variable, and the causal mechanism often remains elusive even after extensive (and often expensive) evaluation. Clinical practice guidelines have been developed to help guide the multidisciplinary approach necessary to diagnose and manage the broad spectrum of patients presenting with syncope. The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association, in collaboration with the Heart Rhythm Society, published its first syncope guidelines in 2017. The European Society of Cardiology released the fourth iteration of its syncope guidelines in 2018. This review highlights the differences and congruencies between the 2 sets of recommendations, their implications for clinical practice, the remaining gaps in understanding, and areas of future research.

Cardiovascular testing in syncope — cardiovascular causes of syncope are common, the presence of significant cardiovascular diseases portends a poor prognosis, and cardiovascular testing can be a critical element in the evaluation and management of selected patients. Abnormalities found during cardiovascular testing may not have a causal relationship to syncope itself, and determining their significance, causality, and whether treatment is merited requires clinical judgment and appropriate selection of cardiovascular testing.

### A new management of syncope: prospective systematic guideline-based evaluation of patients referred urgently to general hospitals [^62ed64d4]. European Heart Journal (2006). Low credibility.

Aims

The guidelines of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) define the current standard for the management of syncope, but are still incompletely applied in the clinical setting.

Methods and Results

Prospective systematic evaluation, on strict adherence to the guidelines, of consecutive patients referred for syncope to the emergency departments of 11 general hospitals. In order to maximize the application, a decision-making guideline-based software was used and trained core medical personnel were designated-both locally in each hospital and centrally-to verify adherence to the diagnostic pathway and give advice on its correction. A diagnostic work-up consistent with the guidelines was completed in 465/541 patients (86%). A definite diagnosis was established in 98% (unexplained in 2%): neurally mediated syncope accounted for 66% of diagnosis, orthostatic hypotension 10%, primary arrhythmias 11%, structural cardiac or cardiopulmonary disease 5%, and non-syncopal attacks 6%, respectively. The initial evaluation (consisting of history, physical examination, and standard electrocardiogram) established a diagnosis in 50% of cases. Hospitalization for the management of syncope was appropriate in 25% and was required for other reasons in a further 13% of cases. The median in-hospital stay was 5.5 days (interquartile range, 3–9). Apart from the initial evaluation, a mean of 1.9 ± 1.1 appropriate tests per patient was performed in 193 patients and led to a final diagnosis in 182 of these (94%).

Conclusion

The results of this study assess the current standard for the management of syncope on the basis of a rigorous adherence to guidelines of the ESC and provide a frame of reference for daily activity when dealing with syncope.

### Will artificial intelligence be "Better" Than humans in the Management of syncope? [^3231de9e]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Variability in syncope symptom presentation, origin, end points, and risk factors, combined with absence of a specific diagnostic test and limited array of effective treatment options, complicates clinical decision-making and increases potential for physician errors. A correct etiological syncope diagnosis is crucial to determine accurate diagnostic and appropriate therapeutic pathways. It is essential during the diagnostic phase to explore only relevant secondary investigations, ensuring resources are used efficiently to minimize patient risks related to unnecessary hospitalizations and over-testing that may create harm. Moreover, clinicians should choose the most suitable treatment based on the etiology of the syncope. If syncope remains undiagnosed after the initial evaluation (ie, history, physical examination, ECG), it is imperative to undertake thorough risk assessment to promptly identify patients at high risk who might benefit from urgent treatment.

While several risk stratification tools and score systems have been developed, they have only partially achieved effective risk stratification. Notably, no studies compare different syncope prognostic tools (SPTs) directly, leaving a gap in knowledge regarding the best recommendations. Few SPTs have undergone external validation. Since syncope-related morbidity and mortality is uncommon, limited size derivation studies are unlikely to include such patients, impacting SPT sensitivity when attempting validation. Furthermore, different SPTs focus on varying outcomes, for example, short- versus long-term adverse events. Existing syncope decision rules have not consistently demonstrated increased diagnostic accuracyor cost savings. Finally, performance of SPTs was not found superior to clinical judgment in syncope risk stratification. Therefore, there is need to properly address syncope's complex and interrelated features. ML, DL, and NLP might accomplish these aims by revealing hidden associations or unexplored patterns, thus improving diagnostic accuracy, risk stratification, interpretation of laboratory or radiological tests, and personalized treatment compared to physicians.

Blood testing in syncope — targeted blood tests are reasonable in the evaluation of selected patients with syncope identified on the basis of clinical assessment from history, physical examination, and electrocardiogram (ECG). Complete blood count and electrolyte panel are frequently obtained during syncope evaluation, the diagnostic yield is low when these are used routinely, and when conducted in patients with a suspected related diagnosis test results can be diagnostic and useful for guiding therapy. Specific testing should stem from the assessment by history and physical examination when the syncope presentation or comorbidities suggest a diagnostic or prognostic role, and results have not been linked to clinical decision making or outcomes.

### Key challenges in the current management of syncope [^2a685e0e]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2012). Medium credibility.

Patients commonly present with syncope at emergency departments and other facilities for urgent care. Syncope is understood by physicians to be a transient, self-terminating period of cerebral hypoperfusion that usually results from systemic hypotension, and clinical guidelines for the care of patients with presumed syncope are available. However, the diagnosis and management of such patients continue to pose important diagnostic, therapeutic, and economic challenges, which are the focus of this Review. First, we discuss how to improve symptom characterization to distinguish syncope from other forms of transient loss of consciousness and syncope mimics. Second, we compare methods of risk stratification in patients with suspected syncope, and recommend the introduction of syncope clinics with enhanced interdisciplinary collaboration to optimize patient care at reduced expense. Third, we highlight the importance of the appropriate selection of diagnostic tools and treatment strategies in these syncope clinics. Finally, we address the difficulties associated with therapy for the most-common form of syncope — vasovagal or reflex syncope.

Emergency department observation protocols in intermediate-risk syncope — In intermediate-risk patients with an unclear cause of syncope, use of a structured emergency department (ED) observation protocol can be effective in reducing hospital admission. Two small RCTs suggest that structured ED-based protocols, consisting of time-limited observation and expedited access to cardiac testing/consultation, result in reduced health service use without adverse impact on clinical outcomes when compared with unstructured hospital admission. "Intermediate" risk factors include the following: ≥ 50 years of age; prior history of cardiac disease, cardiac device without evidence of dysfunction, concerning ECG findings, or family history of early SCD; and symptoms not consistent with reflex-mediated syncope. Both trials also allowed unstructured physician judgment to identify intermediate-risk patients.

Study Objectives

There is limited evidence to guide the emergency department (ED) evaluation and management of syncope. The First International Workshop on Syncope Risk Stratification in the Emergency Department identified key research questions and methodological standards essential to advancing the science of ED-based syncope research.

Methods

We recruited a multinational panel of syncope experts. A preconference survey identified research priorities, which were refined during and after the conference through an iterative review process.

Results

There were 31 participants from 7 countries who represented 10 clinical and methodological specialties. High-priority research recommendations were organized around a conceptual model of ED decisionmaking for syncope, and they address definition, cohort selection, risk stratification, and management.

Conclusion

We convened a multispecialty group of syncope experts to identify the most pressing knowledge gaps and defined a high-priority research agenda to improve the care of patients with syncope in the ED.

Electrocardiography — In the initial evaluation of patients with syncope, a resting 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) is useful, and ECG can help identify potential causes and arrhythmogenic substrates; although prospective studies did not conclude that ECG findings significantly affected subsequent management, a multicenter observational study found that atrial fibrillation, intraventricular conduction disturbances, left ventricular hypertrophy by voltage, and ventricular pacing were associated with increased risk of death from all causes at 1 year.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® syncope [^fb4c15b4]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Syncope and presyncope lead to well over one million emergency room visits in the United States each year. Elucidating the cause of syncope or presyncope, which are grouped together given similar etiologies and outcomes, can be exceedingly difficult given the diverse etiologies. This becomes more challenging as some causes, such as vasovagal syncope, are relatively innocuous while others, such as cardiac-related syncope, carry a significant increased risk of death. While the mainstay of syncope and presyncope assessment is a detailed history and physical examination, imaging can play a role in certain situations. In patients where a cardiovascular etiology is suspected based on the appropriate history, physical examination, and ECG findings, resting transthoracic echocardiography is usually considered appropriate for the initial imaging. While no imaging studies are considered usually appropriate when there is a low probability of cardiac or neurologic pathology, chest radiography may be appropriate in certain clinical situations. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

Syncope and palpitations are common complaints for patients presenting to their primary care provider. They represent symptoms that most often have a benign etiology but rarely can be the first warning sign of a serious condition, such as arrhythmias, structural heart disease, or noncardiac disease. The history, physical examination, and noninvasive testing can, in most cases, distinguish benign from pathologic causes. This article introduces syncope and palpitations, with emphasis on the differential diagnoses, initial presentation, diagnostic strategy, and various management strategies.

### Approach to the patient… [^6a31da71]. AAFP (2011). Low credibility.

Initial Risk Stratification Patients with syncope have an increased risk of death from any cause and cardiovascular events. When syncope is secondary to a cardiac etiology, the risk of death from any cause is more than twofold. Neurally mediated and orthostatic syncope do not confer an increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity or mortality. 1 Several clinical decision rules have been developed to aid physicians in determining the short-term risk of death. A prospective cohort study applied the San Francisco Syncope Rule to 791 patients evaluated for syncope in the emergency department. The most recent clinical decision rule used to predict one-month serious outcome is the Risk Stratification of Syncope in the Emergency Department, a single-center, prospective, observational study of 550 adults with syncope.

17 the European Society of Cardiology Task Force on Syncope, 13 and the American College of Emergency Physicians 19 clinical policy offer guidelines for the evaluation of patients with syncope. The AHA/ACCF outlines an algorithmic approach to syncope. 17 If the initial evaluation is nondiagnostic, echocardiography and ischemic evaluation are recommended. STRUCTURAL HEART DISEASE Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia/cardiomyopathy are genetic syndromes associated with increased sudden death from arrhythmia. Syncope is an ominous sign for patients with arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia/cardiomyopathy and confers a fivefold risk of sudden cardiac death in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy when associated with exercise. For both of these conditions, ICD may be appropriate to decrease the risk of sudden death.

OLDER PATIENTS The incidence of syncope increases sharply after 70 years of age and poses special consideration in light of multiple comorbid conditions, age-related changes, atypical presentation, and concomitant medication use. The most common causes of syncope in this population are orthostatic hypotension, carotid sinus hypersensitivity, and cardiac causes.

ACC/AHA/HRS orthostatic tachycardia and hypotension definitions — orthostatic tachycardia is "A sustained increase in heart rate of ≥ 30 bpm within 10 min of moving from a recumbent to a quiet (nonexertional) standing position (or ≥ 40 bpm in individuals 12–19 y of age)". Orthostatic hypotension (OH) is "A drop in systolic BP of ≥ 20 mm Hg or diastolic BP of ≥ 10 mm Hg with assumption of an upright posture". Initial (immediate) OH is "A transient BP decrease within 15 s after standing, with presyncope or syncope". Classic OH is "A sustained reduction of systolic BP of ≥ 20 mm Hg or diastolic BP of ≥ 10 mm Hg within 3 min of assuming upright posture". Delayed OH is "A sustained reduction of systolic BP of ≥ 20 mm Hg (or 30 mm Hg in patients with supine hypertension) or diastolic BP of ≥ 10 mm Hg that takes ≥ 3 min of upright posture to develop", and "The fall in BP is usually gradual until reaching the threshold". Neurogenic OH is "A subtype of OH that is due to dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system and not solely due to environmental triggers (such as dehydration or drugs)".

### Syncope: evaluation and differential diagnosis [^7396cc1d]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Syncope is an abrupt and transient loss of consciousness caused by cerebral hypoperfusion. It accounts for 1% to 1.5% of emergency department visits, resulting in high hospital admission rates and significant medical costs. Syncope is classified as neurally mediated, cardiac, and orthostatic hypotension. Neurally mediated syncope is the most common type and has a benign course, whereas cardiac syncope is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Patients with presyncope have similar prognoses to those with syncope and should undergo a similar evaluation. A standardized approach to syncope evaluation reduces hospital admissions and medical costs, and increases diagnostic accuracy. The initial assessment for all patients presenting with syncope includes a detailed history, physical examination, and electrocardiography. The initial evaluation may diagnose up to 50% of patients and allows immediate short-term risk stratification. Laboratory testing and neuroimaging have a low diagnostic yield and should be ordered only if clinically indicated. Several comparable clinical decision rules can be used to assess the short-term risk of death and the need for hospital admission. Low-risk patients with a single episode of syncope can often be reassured with no further investigation. High-risk patients with cardiovascular or structural heart disease, history concerning for arrhythmia, abnormal electrocardiographic findings, or severe comorbidities should be admitted to the hospital for further evaluation. In cases of unexplained syncope, provocative testing and prolonged electrocardiographic monitoring strategies can be diagnostic. The treatment of neurally mediated and orthostatic hypotension syncope is largely supportive, although severe cases may require pharmacotherapy. Cardiac syncope may require cardiac device placement or ablation.

Orthostatic syndromes — diagnostic definitions and thresholds are described as follows: Orthostatic intolerance is a syndrome with frequent, recurrent, or persistent lightheadedness, palpitations, tremulousness, generalized weakness, blurred vision, exercise intolerance, and fatigue upon standing; symptoms can occur with or without orthostatic tachycardia, orthostatic hypotension (OH), or syncope, and individuals have ≥ 1 of these symptoms associated with reduced ability to maintain upright posture. Orthostatic tachycardia is a sustained increase in heart rate of ≥ 30 bpm within 10 min of moving from a recumbent to a quiet (nonexertional) standing position, or ≥ 40 bpm in individuals 12–19 y of age. OH is a drop in systolic blood pressure (BP) of ≥ 20 mm Hg or diastolic BP of ≥ 10 mm Hg with assumption of an upright posture. Initial (immediate) OH is a transient BP decrease within 15 s after standing, with presyncope or syncope. Classic OH is a sustained reduction of systolic BP of ≥ 20 mmHg or diastolic BP of ≥ 10 mmHg within 3 min of assuming upright posture. Delayed OH is a sustained reduction of systolic BP of ≥ 20 mm Hg (or ≥ 30 mm Hg in patients with supine hypertension) or diastolic BP of ≥ 10 mm Hg that takes ≥ 3 min of upright posture to develop; the fall in BP is usually gradual until reaching the threshold.

Cardiac rhythm monitors — device capabilities and patient selection for syncope are summarized as follows: Holter monitor provides continuous recording for 24–72 h, up to 2 wk with newer models, and is appropriate when symptoms are frequent enough to be detected within a short period (24–72 h) of monitoring. Patient‑activated, transtelephonic event monitors are suited for frequent, spontaneous symptoms likely to occur within 2–6 wk. External loop recorders continuously store rhythm data and can capture events antecedent to (3–14 min), during, and after (1–4 min) a trigger; selection is for frequent, spontaneous symptoms related to syncope, likely to recur within 2–6 wk. External patch recorders, with various models that record from 2–14 d and patient‑trigger capability, can be considered as an alternative to external loop recorder; unlike Holter monitors and other external monitors, they offer only 1‑lead recording. Mobile cardiac outpatient telemetry records and transmits data up to 30 d to a central monitoring station attended 24 h/d and is used for spontaneous symptoms related to syncope and rhythm correlation, including in high‑risk patients whose rhythm requires real‑time monitoring. Implantable cardiac monitors are subcutaneously implanted with a battery life of 2–3 y and are used for recurrent, infrequent, unexplained syncope of suspected arrhythmic cause after a nondiagnostic initial workup, with or without structural heart disease.

### Risk-stratification tools for emergency department patients with syncope: a systematic review and meta-analysis of direct evidence for SAEM GRACE [^fe4a0958]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Syncope accounts for about 1% of all emergency department (ED) visits. While the etiology is often benign, approximately 10% of patients have serious or life‐threatening causes that may not be apparent during the initial ED assessment. Identifying ED syncope patients with serious or life‐threatening causes and requiring further diagnostic evaluation and monitoring has been a significant challenge for emergency physicians. Frequently, expensive, unnecessary, and potentially harmful investigations are undertaken for fear of missing life‐threatening or otherwise serious underlying causes, particularly cardiogenic causes. Such overtesting often leads to prolonged hospitalization, and excessive resource utilization.

Investigators have developed clinical decision rules (CDRs) to try and predict adverse outcomes and risk stratify ED syncope patients to minimize unnecessary resource utilization.CDRs are tools designed to assist clinicians in making decisions at the bedside. They are derived from original research and incorporate important predictors of outcome from history, physical examination, and basic diagnostic tests.

The first‐ever systematic review and meta‐analysis (SRMA) to evaluate the methodological quality and prognostic accuracy of CDRs for ED patients with syncope reported limitations at outcome and study levels. A key limitation of the SR at the outcome level was the diversity of clinical and methodological aspects across studies. The SR study‐level limitations included the absence of an appropriate syncope reference test or criterion standard and differing syncope definitions across studies.

In the context of the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine (SAEM)'s Guidelines for Reasonable and Appropriate Care in the Emergency Department (GRACE) initiative, because syncope is a relatively common ED presentation with life‐threatening causes that may not be apparent in the ED, the current SR evaluates the direct evidence on the efficacy of CDRs to risk stratify ED syncope patients and predict adverse outcomes. Specifically, this SRMA aims to address the following question: in patients 16 years of age or older who present in the ED with syncope for whom no underlying serious or life‐threatening condition is found during the index ED visit, are risk stratification tools better than unstructured clinical judgment for providing accurate prognosis and aiding disposition decision for outcomes within 30 days?

### Syncope management unit: evolution of the concept and practice implementation [^417be60f]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Syncope, a clinical syndrome, has many potential causes. The prognosis of a patient experiencing syncope varies from benign outcome to increased risk of mortality or sudden death, determined by the etiology of syncope and the presence of underlying disease. Because a definitive diagnosis often cannot be established immediately, hospital admission is frequently recommended as the "default" approach to ensure patient's safety and an expedited evaluation. Hospital care is costly while no studies have shown that clinical outcomes are improved by the in-patient practice approach. The syncope unit is an evolving practice model based on the hypothesis that a multidisciplinary team of physicians and allied staff with expertise in syncope management, working together and equipped with standard clinical tools could improve clinical outcomes. Preliminary data have demonstrated that a specialized syncope unit can improve diagnosis in a timely manner, reduce hospital admission and decrease the use of unnecessary diagnostic tests. In this review, models of syncope units in the emergency department, hospital and outpatient clinics from different practices in different countries are discussed. Similarities and differences of these syncope units are compared. Outcomes and endpoints from these studies are summarized. Developing a syncope unit with a standardized protocol applicable to most practice settings would be an ultimate goal for clinicians and investigators who have interest, expertise, and commitment to improve care for this large patient population.

Treatment of syncope — general principles: The principal goals of treatment for patients with syncope are to prolong survival, limit physical injuries, and prevent recurrences. The importance and priority of these different goals are dependent on the cause of syncope; for example, in patients with VT causing syncope, the mortality risk is clearly predominant, while in patients with reflex syncope the prevention of recurrences and/or limitation of injuries. Knowledge of the cause of syncope has a key role in selection of treatment, and once the cause has been ascertained, the second goal is to assess the mechanism leading to syncope.

### Trauma and syncope: looking beyond the injury [^a16d3f2c]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2023). Medium credibility.

How can trauma be managed differently to prevent recurrent syncope and future trauma?

Gold-standard trauma care evaluates patients in line with the advanced trauma life support (ATLS) programme. This section will examine the relationship between the evaluation of syncope (figure 2) and ATLS principles in the context of trauma (figure 4).

Figure 4
A systematic outline of ATLS principles. ATLS, advanced trauma life support.

When undertaking the primary survey, patients with suspected traumatic cervical spine injury should be immobilized with spinal precautions in line with ATLS guidance. Horizontal immobilization aids venous return and reduces the risk of orthostatic syncopal events. Consideration on an individual basis should be given to patients with head injury and suspected intracranial hypertension as ideal head elevation of 30° reduces the risk of intracranial hypertension but may reduce cerebral perfusion pressures and cause syncope. Furthermore, if patients are restricted from lying horizontally, strain on the blood pressure control system can continue and syncope may recur. Awareness and preventative measures aimed to resolve hemodynamic instability would help reduce the incidence of such events. The recording of orthostatic blood pressures to identify OH within the initial syncope evaluation may not be possible due to immobilization, limb fracture, or severe soft tissue injury. In addition, OH in the acute setting may also be affected by the trauma presentation and later assessment will be important. A meta-analysis involving 121 913 patients provides strong evidence of an association between OH and all-cause mortality. However, it is acknowledged that the comorbidities associated with OH are likely to cause this increase in mortality. Thus, if OH is suspected, orthostatic blood pressure recordings for diagnostic confirmation can be delayed until clinically appropriate.

### Geriatric syncope and cardiovascular risk in the emergency department [^1673bcd3]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Syncope is a transient loss of consciousness that is caused by a brief loss in generalized cerebral blood flow.

Objective

This article reviews the background, epidemiology, etiologies, evaluation, and disposition considerations of geriatric patients with syncope, with a focus on cardiovascular risk.

Discussion

Although syncope is one of the most common symptoms in elderly patients presenting to the emergency department, syncope causes in geriatric patients can present differently than in younger populations, and the underlying etiology is often challenging to discern. History, physical examination, and electrocardiography (ECG) have the greatest utility in evaluating syncope. Additional testing should be guided by history and physical examination. There are multiple scoring tools developed to aid in management and these are reviewed in the article. Common predictors that would indicate a need for further work-up include a history of cardiac or valvular disease (i.e., ventricular dysrhythmia, congestive heart failure), abnormal ECG, anemia or severe volume depletion (i.e., from a gastrointestinal bleed), syncope while supine or with effort, report of palpitations or chest pain, persistent abnormal vital signs, or family history of sudden death. With advancing age, cardiovascular morbidity plays a more frequent and important role in the etiology of syncope.

Conclusions

The syncope work-up should be tailored to the patient's presentation. Disposition should be based on the results of the initial evaluation and risk factors for adverse outcomes.

Table 3
Canadian Syncope Risk Score

Between 2009 and 2018, the ESC guidance altered from an emphasis on risk stratification techniques in the management of syncope to recognizing that the diagnostic accuracy from risk stratification may only equal that of good clinical judgement. An investigation into syncope history-taking demonstrated that a variety of clinical judgment at initial assessment exists, where the diagnostic accuracy from assessment in the ED was 65% compared with 80% from independent syncope researchers with a standardized approach. Importantly, no cardiac syncope was missed by either group. Furthermore, Sutton et al established a difference in diagnostic yield for syncope of 14% between the < 60 years group (68%) and the > 60 years group (54%). As most trauma patients presenting with syncope are elderly and assessed in the ED, risk stratification can be a powerful tool for trauma teams.

In summary, after the initial syncope evaluation and management of the sequalae of trauma, a decision whether to admit the patient into the hospital, provide a short period of observation or discharge the patient to be managed in the community must be considered. As discussed, patients presenting with high-risk features should be admitted for specialty medical assessment in under 24 hours. Patients with low-risk features indicative of reflex syncope or OH can be discharged directly from the ED with ongoing community management. Patients with neither low-risk nor high-risk features require expert syncope opinion. Expert opinion obtained in an ED observational unit compared with admission to the hospital has shown decreased hospital admission times with no difference in serious adverse outcome rates.

Electrophysiological study (EPS) — syncope with normal ECG and normal cardiac structure/function: EPS is not recommended for syncope evaluation in patients with a normal ECG and normal cardiac structure and function, unless an arrhythmic etiology is suspected, and supporting data show low diagnostic yield in this setting, including in a prospective series with abnormal ECG versus normal ECG (22% versus 3.7%), low yield without cardiac disease (2.6%), limited diagnostic findings in a 34-patient series (diagnostic in only 4; abnormal not diagnostic in 2; normal in 28), and markedly lower EPS abnormalities when ECG and ambulatory monitor are normal versus abnormal (9% versus 82%).

### 2014 ESC guidelines on diagnosis and management of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: the task force for the diagnosis and management of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) [^11206c8f]. European Heart Journal (2014). Medium credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for syncope, more specifically with respect to initial ECG, ESC 2014 guidelines recommend to obtain a 12-lead ECG to identify the cause of symptoms in patients with unexplained syncope.
