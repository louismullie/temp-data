## Question

## Task 3/89

Let A be the area and u = a + b + c the perimeter of a triangle with side lengths a, b, and c. Determine the maximum of the ratio z = [A/u²].

For which triangles is it assumed?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for the maximum value of the ratio of a triangle's area to the square of its perimeter, and which triangle achieves that maximum. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to express the ratio in terms of side lengths and the semiperimeter. Then, I should consider whether fixing the perimeter and maximizing area is equivalent to fixing the area and minimizing perimeter, and how scaling affects the ratio. Next, I will examine the isoperimetric inequality for triangles and verify that the equilateral triangle maximizes area for a given perimeter. After that, I should compute the exact maximum value of the ratio for an equilateral triangle. Finally, I will confirm that no other triangle can exceed this value and state the conclusion clearly.

> Let me first set up the notation and the quantity to optimize. Let the side lengths be a, b, c, the perimeter u = a + b + c, and the semiperimeter s = u/2. The area A is given by Heron's formula as A = √[s(s − a)(s − b)(s − c)], so the ratio we want to maximize is z = A/u² = √[s(s − a)(s − b)(s − c)] / (2s)² = √[s(s − a)(s − b)(s − c)] / (4s²). Wait, let me verify that simplification: yes, u = 2s, so u² = 4s², and the expression is correct.

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about which triangle maximizes this ratio. I should confirm the isoperimetric property for triangles. The classical isoperimetric inequality for triangles states that, for a fixed perimeter, the equilateral triangle has the largest area, and equivalently, for a fixed area, the equilateral triangle has the smallest perimeter. This means that among all triangles with the same perimeter, the equilateral triangle will yield the largest value of A/u², since the numerator A is maximized while the denominator u² is fixed. I need to ensure I'm applying this correctly: yes, fixing u and maximizing A directly increases z, so the equilateral triangle is the candidate maximizer.

> Next, I should compute the exact maximum value for an equilateral triangle. Let all sides be equal to a, so the perimeter is u = 3a and the semiperimeter is s = 3a/2. The area is A = (√3/4)a². Substituting into the ratio, z = A/u² = (√3/4)a² / (3a)² = (√3/4)a² / (9a²) = √3/36. Wait, let me double-check the arithmetic: yes, the a² cancels and √3 divided by 4 times 9 is √3/36, which is approximately 0.0481.

> I should confirm that no other triangle can exceed this value. Because the isoperimetric inequality is strict for non-equilateral triangles, any deviation from equilateral reduces the area for the same perimeter, thereby lowering the ratio A/u². Therefore, the maximum is uniquely achieved by the equilateral triangle. Let me reconsider whether degenerate cases could approach this; degenerate triangles have zero area, so their ratio is 0, which is certainly less than √3/36, reinforcing that the maximum is indeed √3/36 for a non-degenerate equilateral triangle.

> Putting this together, I will now state the conclusion. The maximum value of the ratio A/u² is √3/36, and this maximum is attained if and only if the triangle is equilateral. I should double-check that I've answered both parts of the question: yes, I've given the maximum value and identified the triangle that achieves it.

---

The maximum value of the ratio (z = [A/u²]) is ([√3/36]), and it is achieved by an **equilateral triangle**. This follows from the isoperimetric inequality for triangles, which states that for a fixed perimeter, the equilateral triangle has the largest area. Therefore, the equilateral triangle maximizes ([A/u²]) because it maximizes the numerator while keeping the denominator fixed. The exact maximum is obtained by substituting the area and perimeter of an equilateral triangle into the ratio, yielding ([√3/36]).

---

## Mathematical formulation

Given a triangle with side lengths (a), (b), and (c), the perimeter is:

u = a + b + c

The area (A) can be calculated using **Heron's formula**:

A = √[s(s − a)(s − b)(s − c)]

where (s = [u/2]) is the semi-perimeter.

The ratio (z) is then:

z = [A/u²] = [√[s(s − a)(s − b)(s − c)]/u²]

---

## Maximizing the ratio

To maximize (z), we need to maximize the area (A) for a given perimeter (u). According to the **isoperimetric inequality for triangles**, the equilateral triangle has the largest area for a given perimeter. Therefore, the maximum value of (z) is achieved when the triangle is equilateral.

---

## Calculation for equilateral triangle

For an equilateral triangle with side length (a), the perimeter is:

u = 3a

The area is:

A = [√3/4] a²

Substituting these into the ratio (z):

z = [A/u²] = [[√3/4] a²/(3a)²] = [√3/4] × [a²/9a²] = [√3/36]

---

## Conclusion

The maximum value of the ratio (z = [A/u²]) is ([√3/36]), and it is achieved by an **equilateral triangle**.

The effect of size and shape

We have demonstrated that, for a fixed shape, the density of obstacles has a strong effect on the distribution of path lengths while leaving the mean value unchanged as long as the total internal accessible area remains the same.

We will now investigate the effects of shape and size on the path length distributions and again conclude that, although path distributions are very sensitive to the detailed geometry of the domain, mean path lengths and residence times can be accurately predicted using only the surface to perimeter ratio. We fabricate microstructures of circular, squared and triangular shapes all in four different sizes as shown in Fig. 2a. In all structures the obstacle density is fixed to N / S = 0.016 μm −2. All recorded trajectories are also plotted in Fig. 2a with a color map encoding the scaled path length L /. In Fig. 2b we plot for each structure the histogram of path lengths normalized by the expected valuein Eq. 4. As we move from circles to squares and then to triangles we observe that the corresponding histograms are characterized by larger frequencies for both short and long path lengths. The probability of short paths increases as we introduce convex corners and reduce their angle, as evidenced by the blue-violet color of the corners in squared and triangular structures. The presence of longer paths in triangles can be also understood noting that the normalized maximum straight paths for circles, square and triangles are respectively 4/ π,/ π and/ π (see Supplementary Fig. 2). Despite these qualitative and quantitative differences between histograms, mean path lengths are always close to 1 when normalized by the predicted valueas shown in Fig. 2b. The observed path length distributions can be very well reproduced by a Lorentz gas model where collisions with obstacles are described as instantaneous reorientation events. These events are assumed to occur with a constant probability per unit path length given by, where/ π is the rotational average cross section of line obstacles with length b (see Methods). For perfectly straight trajectories, circles and squares have path length distributions with a vertical asymptote. A strong peak is found at the location of this divergence and is progressively smeared as the linear size of the domain becomes larger than the mean free path. Upon increasing the size of the region a peak aroundappears due to bacteria that scatter close to the boundary, reorient and exit. The mix of these two types of trajectories gives rise to the observed double-peak structure. Differently for the triangle no asymptote is present in the P (L) for large λ, therefore only a peak atprogressively appears. These results show that P (L) depends strongly on the random walk properties (as the mean free path), and on the domain features (shape and size). Differently the mean valuesanddepend only on the surface to perimeter ratio of the domain as expressed by Eq. 4. Experimental values ofare shown Fig. 3a for all shapes and sizes. We find an excellent agreement with theory using the same value s = 6.3 μm 2 that was used previously to predict the experimental values ofas a function of the number of obstacles (see Fig. 1c). This value of s has also been used to calculateaccording to Eq. 5 which captures quantitatively well the experimental data as shown in Fig. 3b.

### Plasma membrane remodeling determines adipocyte expansion and mechanical adaptability [^a60bafb5]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Quantification of caveolar contribution to adipocyte volumetric oscillations

Caveolar flattening provides additional membrane surfaceand could thereby enable adipocyte expansion by readily increasing cellular volume. To estimate this effect, we considered the adipocyte with the largest median PM-LD distance in our dataset (1.78 microns), which had 9.13 caveolae per micron of PM perimeter. This corresponds to 83.36 caveolae per square μm of PM surface. Assuming a spherical morphology for caveolae and a typical value of 80 nm in diameter, the surface area for individual caveolae would correspond to 4·π·0.040 2 = 0.02 μm 2, and total caveolar area would be 0.02·83.36 = 1.67 μm 2 per μm 2 of PM. Thus, the fraction of caveolar membrane content per unit would be 1.67/ (1.67+1) = 0.63, meaning that caveolae comprise up to 63% of total adipocyte membrane surface area. Based on our analysis of caveolae disappearance as the LD grows (Fig. 1) and previous reports, about 90% of caveolae could completely flatten out. This magnitude of caveolae flattening would result in a final 1+0.9·1.67 = 2.50 μm 2 per initial μm 2 of PM, and thereby account for a 2.50x increase in cell surface, which would correspond to aincrease in adipocyte volume.

Calculation of area coverage percentage by circles in hexagonal packing arrangement

The maximum area covered by circles of radiusis achieved when they are arranged in a hexagonal lattice. Therefore, by computing the area of a hexagon (that tessellate the whole 2D space), and the area of the inscribed circle (Supplementary Fig. 2m), we can obtain the maximum fraction of area covered by circles as the ratio between both areas.

A hexagon would be composed by 12 triangles as shown in Supplementary Fig. 2m. From simple trigonometry calculations, we obtain the radius of the hexagon (L):

The base of the triangle would equal:

Lleading to a triangle area, A t:

The hexagon area (A h) will thus result:

The area of the inscribed circle is:

With this we obtain the fraction of hexagon covered by a circle:

Thus, packing of perfect circles would cover at most approximately 90.7% of the area.

### Controlled packing and single-droplet resolution of 3D-printed functional synthetic tissues [^3b7915f7]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Classifying packing types

To estimate the proportion of packing types within each network, we first generated a mesh over the print by performing a Delaunay triangulation using the centres of all regions classified as droplets as the input points. A convenient property of this triangulation method is that the circumcircle of each triangle contains no other points; each triangle therefore represents a triplet of neighbouring droplets and provides localised geometrical information about their arrangements.

The plot of the bivariate distribution of the largest angle of each triangle vs the triangle area normalised by the average droplet area for all prints revealed two distinct clusters of triangles, one corresponding to hexagonally packed droplet regions, and one corresponding to square-packed droplet regions (Supplementary Fig. 3 d). Reasoning that these represented stable configurations of droplets for certain printing parameters, we classified each triangle using these clusters. Four packing categories were used: 'hexagonal' (closely packed triplets of droplets arranged as equilateral triangles), 'square' (closely packed triplets of droplets arranged as right-angled triangles), 'amorphous' (closely packed triplets of droplets of intermediate arrangement) and 'no packing' (triplets of droplets that are not close-packed). For a hexagonal classification. For an amorphous classification. For a square classification. In addition, for all of these classes. Triangles that fell outside of these ranges were classified as no packing (Supplementary Fig. 3 d).

Some elongated 'sliver' triangles were classified as being a member of one of the closely packed classes, despite being composed of widely spaced droplets. Closer analysis of these triangles revealed that they were generally composed of two closely packed droplets and a single more distant droplet, together forming a skinny near-isosceles triangle. We therefore applied an additional constraint based on the perimeter of each triangle normalised by the average droplet radius. Since for perfect hexagonal packing, and for a perfect square packing, we set the constraintfor the closely packed classes based on a linear interpolation between these two points. Our chosen y -intercept for this constraint is slightly greater than the theoretical y -intercept from the interpolation, allowing triangles with small deviations from the perfect packing geometry to be classified as closely packed while still ensuring classification of sliver triangles as no packing.

### Subicular neurons encode concave and convex geometries [^1eca6b36]. Nature (2024). Excellent credibility.

To test the contribution of corner cells to spatial coding, we first trained the decoder using all neurons and then replaced the neural activity of corner cells with vectors of zeroes from the test data before making predictions. It is important to note that this activity removal procedure was only applied to the data used for predicting locations and not for training, as ablating neurons directly from the training data will result in the model learning to compensate for the missing information. We performed this analysis using ten-fold cross-validation for each mouse. To compare the performance of the corner cell removed decoder to the full decoder, we first calculated the 2D decoding error map of a session for each condition, and then obtained a map for error ratio by dividing the error map from the corner cell removed decoder by the error map from the full decoder (Extended Data Fig. 2g). We then compared the error ratio at the corners of the environment to the centre of the environment. For quadrant decoding in the square environment (Fig. 1l), we trained and tested the decoder using only the identified corner cells without the two-step constraint using ten-fold-cross-validation. For the shuffled condition, the decoder was trained and tested for 100 times using circularly shuffled calcium spikes over time. The probability in the correct quadrant was compared between the corner cell trained and shuffled decoders. For decoding the geometry of different environments (Extended Data Fig. 5d–f), we concatenated the data (time bin = 400 ms) with neurons tracked from circle, triangle, square and hexagon environments for each animal. The data was then resampled from an 8 cm diameter circular area either in the centre or near the corner/boundary of the environment. The data length was matched between the two areas and the decoding labels for each environment were identical (numerical, 1 for circle, 2 for square, 3 for triangle, 4 for hexagon). Then the decoder was trained and tested for each mouse using 10-fold-cross-validation.

### Boundaries steer the contraction of active gels [^779cd01a]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

Temporal asymmetric contraction of rectangles

The necessity of force imbalance for the contribution of material to the contraction speed implies that the contraction process depends on the exact asymmetry of the activated areas. For asymmetric patterns, for example, rectangles of initial aspect ratio α init ≡ X init / Y init > 1 (see Supplementary Movie 2), the distance of the centre region to the boundary is different for the two principal axes. Consequently, the maximum contraction velocity for the long axis, should be reached later than for the shorter axis,(Fig. 3a and Supplementary Fig. 2). There will exist regions in space that have the ability to contract in y -direction while still being unable to contract in x -direction. Yet the initial contraction velocity around the perimeter of the pattern should be uniform, independent of the geometry. Which is indeed what we see (inset of Fig. 3b). As we observed identical aspect ratios before and after contraction (red squares in Fig. 3b), this implies a temporal asymmetric contraction, where the short side contracts before the long side, followed by the contraction of the long side. This asymmetry in time gets captured in a transient increase of the aspect ratio to its maximum α max (blue circles in Fig. 3b).

As we have seen for symmetric patterns the maximum contraction speed is proportional to the initial distance between the boundaries. For asymmetric patterns with identical areas, this would predict that the ratioof the maximal velocities of the principal axes equals the initial aspect ratio. However, experimentally we findwith γ = 0.4 ± 0.1 (Fig. 3c). This non-trivial dependence indicates an intricate dynamic coupling of the principal axes, resulting in either a hampered contraction along the length or an enhanced contraction along the width.

To shed light on this issue we activate a series of rectangles with constant half-length X init and variable half-width Y init. The maximal velocity of the width increases linearly with increasing width as expected for the symmetric, undisturbed contraction, whereas the maximum contraction speed along the length gets increased nonlinearly as the initial width gets larger (Fig. 3d). If there was no coupling, the maximal contraction speed of the length should be independent of the other dimension's size. Yet, the shortest side of an asymmetrically shaped, isotropic, contracting gel determines the overall dynamics of contraction.

### Comparing accuracies of length-type geographic atrophy growth rate metrics using atrophy-front growth modeling [^3d2eb435]. Ophthalmology Science (2022). Medium credibility.

It is interesting to note that the square-root-transformed metrics tend to overestimate the growth rate, whereas the perimeter-adjusted growth rates tend to underestimate the growth rate. The overestimation of square-root-transformed metrics can be understood as a consequence of the inverse proportionality to the square root of circularity (equation 2) and thedependency on focality (equation 3). The underestimation of the perimeter-adjusted growth rates can be understood as a consequence of lesion merging, which censors GA growth (Appendix 3) and anisotropic growth fields, which, as mentioned, increase the follow-up lesion's perimeter-to-area ratio.

Considering the scatterplots of Figure 5, we see that with increasing follow-up intervals, a trend of improving accuracy for the effective radius metric and a worsening accuracy for the perimeter adjusted metric emerges. The latter is expected and can be understood as a consequence of increased lesion merging (see, for example, merging at the longer intervals in Fig 6). The former is somewhat less expected, but can be understood as a consequence of the increasing circularity and decreasing focality of follow-up lesions in the large growth limit; that is, the follow-up lesions tend to look more like (unifocal) circles at longer follow-up intervals (Fig 6). Moreover, because the follow-up lesions have substantially more area than the baseline lesions, they dominate the contribution of the baseline lesion areas in the difference of square-root-of-areas computation (equation 1). However, an important caveat to this trend is that, in clinically observed GA growth patterns, we expect to see the formation of new lesion foci during the follow-up interval, the probability of which increases with longer follow-up intervals. Such new foci formation would tend to decrease the accuracy of the square-root-transformed metrics. Notably, new foci formation was not modeled in our simulations, a limitation discussed later.

### In primary airway epithelial cells, the unjamming transition is distinct from the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition [^347c13da]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Fig. 5
In theory and experiment, cell shape and collective dynamics discriminate UJT from pEMT.

The dynamic vertex model (DVM) attributes the effects of pEMT mainly to diminished edge tension but attributes those of UJT mainly to augmented cellular propulsion. a DVM predicts that during UJT versus pEMT two different metrics of cell shape diverge; aspect ratio (AR) emphasizes elongation whereas shape index q emphasizes perimeter (q = perimeter/(area 1/2)). Increasing p 0 (- - -) moderately increases AR but substantially increases q, resulting in somewhat elongated cells with tortuous edges. By contrast, increasing v 0 (_._._) substantially increases AR but minimally increases q, resulting in elongated cells with straight edges. Measurements of AR and q from cells undergoing UJT (blue squares) or pEMT (red triangles) are consistent with those predictions. Insets show traced cell edges from representative images of cells in each state. During pEMT edge tension decreases as junctional adhesion decreases, and as cells elongate q increases more quickly than AR. Cell–cell junctions become increasingly tortuous and slack. During UJT, by contrast, edge tension increases as cellular propulsion v 0 increases, AR and q increase in tandem, and cells elongate. Cell–cell junctions remain straight and taut. Theory and experimental data, taken together, suggest that layer fluidization by means of UJT versus pEMT follow divergent pathways. b DVM predicts that median pack size and average cell speed will, as persistence length l 0… increases, positively scale together. The time courses of median pack size and speed from jammed cells (black circles) or those undergoing pEMT (red triangles) did not follow this relationship. However, the time evolution of median pack size and speed from cells undergoing UJT (blue squares) are consistent with these predictions. During UJT, cellular cooperativity emerges and cells are able to move quickly in locally coordinated groups. Pack sizes, for both experimental and simulation data, were scaled by the size of the system, while cell speeds were scaled by the global maximum. Insets show representative dynamic packs from cells undergoing pEMT or UJT (scale bar: 100 µm). DVM simulation and experimental data, taken together, thus provide a physical picture of two distinct mechanisms of transition of a cellular collective from a solid-like to a fluid-like state.

### Comparing accuracies of length-type geographic atrophy growth rate metrics using atrophy-front growth modeling [^0aeeeab5]. Ophthalmology Science (2022). Medium credibility.

Based on our analytical derivations and the results from our numerical simulations, the reduced accuracy of square-root-transformed metrics seems to be a consequence of their relatively strong dependence on lesion focality and circularity, both of which affect the lesion's perimeter-to-area ratio. Despite its superior performance, the perimeter-adjusted metric, like the square-root-transformed metrics, shows a trend of decreasing accuracy with increasing growth rate. For the perimeter-adjusted metric, this decrease in accuracy is likely the result of (1) the increased intrafocus and interfoci merging that occurs at increased growth rates and (2) an exacerbation of the effects of anisotropic growth. In particular, larger anisotropic growths will cause greater increases in the follow-up lesion's perimeter-to-area ratio, which can skew the estimation. Fortunately, most of the GA growth rates encountered in clinical data are sufficiently slow such that severe failures of the perimeter adjusted growth rate are relatively uncommon.

The biological interpretation of GA growth metrics afforded by our growth modeling framework may help to guide the selection of the type of growth rate metrics that are used for clinical trials of GA therapeutics. For example, because length-type GA growth rates can be viewed as position-time averages of the growth field (equation SI-3, Appendix 1), they are most appropriate when lesion geometry is not of interest. In particular, we argue that this is often the case when estimating (global) GA therapeutic effects, wherein variations in baseline lesion geometry can obfuscate relevant biology. Indeed, within our growth modeling framework, therapeutic efficacy can be interpreted as a reduction of the values of the growth field. However, scenarios exist in which area-type growth rate metrics are desirable. For example, if predicting visual field loss is of interest, both the lesion geometry (size and location) and the growth field are relevant, and the natural coupling of these factors in area-rate metrics is advantageous.

### Resolving and rescuing developmental miswiring in a mouse model of cognitive impairment [^d731d45f]. Neuron (2020). Medium credibility.

Neuronal morphological analysis

Sholl analysis and spine density quantification were carried out in the ImageJ environment. For Sholl analysis, images were binarized (auto threshold) and dendrites were traced using the semi-automatical plugin Simple Neurite Tracer. The traced dendritic tree was analyzed with the plugin Sholl Analysis, after the geometric center was identified using the blow/lasso tool. For spine density quantification, we first traced the dendrite of interest (apical, basal, proximal oblique or secondary apical) and measured its length (line) and then manually counted the number of spines (point picker).

Iba-1 + -cells quantification

To quantify the number of Iba-1 stained cells we used a custom-written algorithm in ImageJ. The image stacks were collapsed to a maximum intensity Z-projection, and background noise was subtracted (despeckle). To facilitate automatic thresholding, the image was passed through a Gaussian filter (Gaussian blur, sigma = 2) before being binarized (auto threshold with the triangle method). The number of cells was counted using analyze particles (size > 150 pixels).

Iba-1 + -cells morphological analysis

The morphology of microglial cells was assessed on maximum intensity Z-projections in the MATLAB environment, using previously reported criteria. Images (n = 64 for each group of mice) were automatically thresholded (graythresh and im2bw functions) and putative microglial cells were identified as objects between 200 and 1500 pixels (bwareaopen). Around the center of mass of each of the isolated cells, a region of interest (ROI) of 110x110 pixels was computed and visually examined. If the ROI contained a properly segmented microglia cells, its features (area, perimeter, eccentricity) were quantified (regionprops). ROIs in which the microglial cell touched the boundaries of the image or in which more than one cell was included were discarded. Further, cell spread (analogous to process length) was computed as the average distance between the center of mass and the "extrema" of the cell; roundness was defined as the ratio between 4 ∗ pi ∗ area and the square of the perimeter of the cell. Only mice that did not experience IUE were used for this analysis.

Evaluation metrics and settings

We introduce the CellSPA framework, that captures evaluation metrics across five complementary categories. A summary of this information is provided in Supplementary Table 2.

[A] Baseline metrics

Overall characteristics
Number of cells
Proportion of transcripts assigned

Cell-level QC metrics
Proportion of cells expressing each gene
Number of transcripts per cell
Number of genes expressed per cell
Cell area

where ∑ i ∈ I n i represents the sum of all total transcripts over a set I, and A represents the cell area.

Cell morphology metrics

We evaluated multiple morphology-based metrics and provide diagrammatic illustrations in Supplementary Fig. 27.

- Elongation = where W bb represents the width of the bounding box, and H bb represents the height of the bounding box.

Elongation measures the ratio of height versus the width of the bounding box (Supplementary Fig. 27 f). Elongation is insensitive to concave irregularities and holes present in the shape of the cell. The value of this metric will be 1 for a perfect square bounding box. As the cell becomes more elongated the value will either increase far above 1 or decrease far below 1, depending on whether the elongation occurs along the height or width of the bounding box.

- Circularity = where A represents the area, and P convex represents the convex perimeter.

Circularity measures the area to perimeter ratio while excluding local irregularities of the cell. We used the convex perimeter of the object as opposed to its true perimeter to avoid concave irregularities. The value will be 1 for a circle and decreases as a cell becomes less circular.

### A computational study on the optimization of transcranial temporal interfering stimulation with high-definition electrodes using unsupervised neural networks [^f1cf8e2e]. Human Brain Mapping (2023). Medium credibility.

2.5 Loss function

Generally, the sum of the squared errors is used to quantify the difference because the loss function returns the difference along with the correct answer, which aims to reduce the error in the neural network. In the brain stimulation problem, the target‐segmented binary vector can be the correct answer in the LSE method. However, the target has a negligible area compared to the entire brain, and the effect of the target's concentration on the result is also small, resulting in a slow convergence rate in the slope descent. For the target‐oriented approach, the three intuitive factors related to successful stimulation are defined as ratios.

The loss function is expressed as the product of three ratios as follows:The peak ratio (PR) is the ratio of the peak modulation of the target to the peak modulation of the non‐target area. Thus, the largest modulation is applied to the target location. The concentration ratio (CR) is the ratio of the modulation density of the target to the average modulation density, indicating how much of the modulation is concentrated at the target position compared with the average modulation density. In principle, to express the density of the normal interference component at the gray‐white matter boundary, modulation should be calculated for each element and appropriately weighted according to the area of the triangle. However, simplified calculations, the "Area" was approximated as the number of nodes in a region assuming that the size of elements was relatively uniform. The unit of the denominator and numerator is not the same as density, however, a ratio of density can be obtained, equally. The mis‐stimulation ratio (MR) is the ratio of the mis‐stimulated area to the target area. Here, mis‐stimulation is defined as the position where the modulation is larger than the average modulation of the target. The Adam optimizer (Jais et al; Kingma & Ba,), which optimizes the weights of the network, is based on gradient descent. In this method, the objective function must be continuous and differentiable. Therefore, the mis‐stimulation area was approximated using a sigmoid function centered on the average value (Kim et al.). Naturally, the three factors being multiplied have different ranges, and multiplying them is arbitrary. Proper weighting and renormalization through repeated testing can lead to improved performance. Similarly, the basic sigmoid function of Equation 8 was also chosen arbitrarily and has the potential to be adjusted.

Estimation of the shape factor

A previous study indicated that the partial hydrodynamic area is critical in settling LDMPs, closely related to the projection area towards the settling direction. A new shape factor is introduced from a recent study considering irregular-shaped particles. The shape factor Ψ is defined as:where Φ is the sphericity of LDMPs and χ is the circularity of LDMPs. Φ is defined as the ratio of the surface area of an equivalent sphere and the surface area of LDMPs:where A sph is the surface area of the equivalent sphere (m 2), and A p is the surface area of LDMPs (m 2). χ is the circularity of LDMPs, defined aswhere P mp is the maximum projection perimeter (m), and P c is the perimeter of a circle with the same area as the maximum projection area of the LDMPs (m). It is noted that for sphere-shaped LDMPs, Ψ ≈ 1.

### Comparing accuracies of length-type geographic atrophy growth rate metrics using atrophy-front growth modeling [^97f30242]. Ophthalmology Science (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The analyses of this study suggest that the perimeter-adjusted metric more accurately measures length-type GA growth rate compared with metrics that use the square-root transformation (i.e. the effective radius or square-root-of-area metrics). These findings complement those of Shen et al, who reported that the perimeter-adjusted metric was statistically independent of lesion perimeter, circularity, and focality, per evaluation on the AREDS dataset. Future studies on larger patient cohorts are needed to understand more fully the clinical implications of the improved accuracy of the perimeter-adjusted metric. However, from Figure 5, we can note that the perimeter-adjusted metric shows lower errors and variances than the effective radius metric. This property, combined with its decreased dependency on lesion geometry (Fig 7), suggests that the perimeter-adjusted metric would be better powered to detect reductions in GA growth rates in clinical trials of GA therapeutics, a point that was explored by Shen et al(Table 5 of their article). However, we expect that the perimeter-adjusted metric will have its greatest practical significance in clinical trials wherein the therapeutic effect size is modest, the number of eyes enrolled is small (e.g. phase 1), the participants are not well randomized, the lesions are not representative of a more general population of interest (e.g. because of a particular geometry-related inclusion criterion), or a combination thereof. Beyond clinical trials, the improved accuracy of the perimeter-adjusted approach may prove important in scientific studies of GA growth, such as examining correlations between GA growth and choriocapillaris impairments, which often use smaller convenience samples. In any case, because the square-root and perimeter-adjusted metrics are comparable in terms of computational difficulty (equation 1 vs. equation 4), the barrier to using the perimeter-adjusted metric is somewhat lowered.

Basic stereological measurements — first-order parameters and probes identify that "First-order parameters are volume (three-dimensional [3D]), surface (two-dimensional [2D]), length (one-dimensional [1D]), and number (zero-dimensional [0D])". Measurements "are performed using geometric test probes, such as points (0D), lines (1D), planes (2D), or volumes (3D)". These probes create countable events in the image, and "Raw counts provide ratios… that are multiplied by the reference space volume to obtain absolute measures for the lung or subcompartment".

### Comparing accuracies of length-type geographic atrophy growth rate metrics using atrophy-front growth modeling [^53dbc2ff]. Ophthalmology Science (2022). Medium credibility.

Observing that GA lesions tend to enlarge along their margins, researchers proposed the perimeter-adjusted growth rate metric, as an extension of the effective radius growth rate to more general, noncircular geometries:

Conveniently, this metric has been well studied in the computer-aided geometric design community in the context of offset curves. It can be shownthat for isotropic, time-invariant growth fields, = Λ for lesions having concave curvatures whose absolute values are small relative to the lesion growth (an illustration of concave and convex margin segments, as well as the precise definition of small, is provided in Appendix 3 and Figure S1). Briefly and informally, a concave margin segment corresponds to an inward bulge in the lesion, and a convex margin segment corresponds to an outward bulge in the lesion). Intuitively, this condition requires that no intrafocus merging occurs. Of note, = Λ for any convex lesion undergoing isotropic, time-invariant growth (a lesion is convex if the entirety of its margin is convex, that is, the lesion has no inward bulges; for example, ellipse-shaped lesions are convex).

Although the above results demonstrate the usefulness of the atrophy-front growth model for interpreting length-type growth rate metrics, they pertain to simplistic geometries and growth patterns. Analysis of arbitrary geometries and growth patterns, for which analytical results are unwieldy or intractable, can be approached numerically, which is the focus of the subsequent section.

Generating Datasets for Numerical Evaluation of Metric Accuracy

Compared with clinically observed GA data, for which the complete growth dynamics are not well understood, simulated GA data have the advantage that the true growth parameters can be precisely specified. Importantly, an observed data set comprising images of a GA lesion acquired at a sequence of follow-up visits does not provide direct information related to the underlying growth field; different growth fields can result in the same observed growth data. This ambiguity is particularly acute for common clinical datasets, for which the intervisit times are relatively lengthy (e.g. 6 months or longer). Because of these challenges, we outline below our growth simulation approach, and then we construct a set of highly simplified lesion geometries and growth fields that highlight inherent limitations of the square-root-transformed and perimeter-adjusted metrics. Finally, we present a semisimulated approach to generating realistic GA growth configurations using real lesion geometries and simulated random growth fields.

### Insect mimicry of plants dates back to the permian [^def4e1de]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

The measurements taken on the tegmen were: maximal length; width on the middle; anterior field width; posterior field width; total area; anterior field area; posterior field area; total perimeter; anterior field perimeter; posterior field perimeter. With these measurements, the following four dimension-free parameters were calculated: (width/length) ratio; (anterior field width/posterior field width) ratio; (anterior field area/posterior field area) ratio; and [4 π (anterior field area)/(anterior field perimeter) 2] corresponding to anterior field circularity. Tegmina were also coded as a single binary character, as being either leaf-like or not leaf-like following the criterion of Mugleston et al. that is, 'leaf-like tegmina were defined as being oblong with the maximum width of the wing larger than the height of the thorax, or not leaf-like, with narrow forewings that are not wider than the height of the thorax'. The values of the five parameters are listed in Supplementary Table 1.

The situation in our fossil is particular because the tip of its tegmen is missing. Two kinds of measurements were taken: measurements with no extrapolation and measurements with missing parts extrapolated with circle segment connections (Supplementary Fig. 9). The parameters calculated with measurements of P. gallica were then compared with the distribution of these parameters in each type of tegmina (leaf-mimicking and non-leaf mimicking). The values for the Mugleston et al.criterion are unknown for P. gallica as its thorax is not preserved.

Nonlinear regression analyses

Analyses were performed with KyPlot 2.15 (KyensLab). Nonlinear regression allows defining if data distributions are significantly best-described with one or with more components. We used this approach to assess whether morphologically distinct types of forewings can be distinguished and whether one of the forewing types includes all Pterochrozinae, a subfamily epitomizing leaf-mimicking species.

The cumulative distribution of each dimension-free parameter calculated with measurements described above was fitted using nonlinear regression. Cumulative distribution was used to avoid the loss of information induced by data binning.

The cumulative distribution of each parameter of all measured Tettigoniidae was first fitted with the following single-cumulative distribution function of the normal distribution.

One component model:

where A 1 is the mean; A 2 is the standard deviation; erf is Gauss error function.

### Comparing accuracies of length-type geographic atrophy growth rate metrics using atrophy-front growth modeling [^7ce3b67b]. Ophthalmology Science (2022). Medium credibility.

A benefit of viewing growth rate metrics through the lens of the atrophy-front growth model is the ability to derive relationships between GA geometry, GA growth patterns, and metric accuracy. For example, consider the effective radius metric, defined as:where A (t) is the lesion area at time t. Note that the effective radius metric is simply a 1 /scaled version of the square-root-of-area metric. Although in this article we work with the effective radius metric, corresponding results for the square-root-of-area metric are obtained through ascaling. As suggested by its name, assumes that the baseline and follow-up lesions are concentric circles and measures the difference of their radii; if this strict geometrical condition is satisfied, then it is easy to show that = v = Λ for isotropic, time-invariant growth fields; that is, under such conditions, is a perfect estimator of length-type growth rate. For more complex lesion geometries, becomes a worse estimator of Λ. For example, for lesion growths that are small relative to the baseline margin perimeter P (t b) and baseline area A (t b), it can be shown (Appendix 2) that Λ andare related by:where G (t) is the GA lesion geometry at time t and circ(·) is the circularity operator, defined as: circ(G (t)) ≡ 4π A (t) / P 2 (t), which takes values between 0 and 1, inclusive. Note that this is the same definition of circularity as used by Domalpally et alin their study of GA growth rates. The accuracy ofalso degrades when measuring multifocal lesions. For example, for n equal-radii circular foci undergoing isotropic growth:

Basic stereological measurements for lung imaging — first-order parameters, probes, and reference space are specified. First-order parameters are volume (three-dimensional [3D]), surface (two-dimensional [2D]), length (one-dimensional [1D]), and number (zero-dimensional [0D]). Measurements are performed using geometric test probes, such as points (0D), lines (1D), planes (2D), or volumes (3D), with probe–voxel interactions generating countable events; raw counts yield ratios that are multiplied by the reference space volume to obtain absolute lung or subcompartment measures. It is crucial to define and measure a biologically meaningful reference space for analysis and reporting, because measurements expressed only as ratios are subject to "the reference trap", where changes can arise from the numerator, denominator, or both; an efficient volume measurement method, point counting, is used for acinar components by micro-CT and for extrapulmonary organ volume by CT.

### Geographic atrophy growth is strongly related to lesion perimeter: unifying effects of lesion area, number, and circularity on growth [^00c837ce]. Ophthalmology: Retina (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To investigate the underlying reason for the previously observed impact of baseline lesion size, number, and circularity on geographic atrophy (GA) growth rate.

Design

Retrospective analysis of a multicenter, prospective, randomized controlled trial.

Participants

Age-Related Eye Disease Study participants with GA secondary to nonexudative age-related macular degeneration.

Methods

We manually delineated atrophic lesions on color fundus photographs of 318 eyes with GA followed up over at least 2 visits (mean follow-up duration, 5.1 ± 3.0 years). We calculated GA area growth rate for each eye based on the first and last visit. GA perimeter-adjusted growth rate was defined as the ratio between GA area growth rate and mean GA perimeter between the first and last visit for each eye.

Main Outcome Measures

GA area growth rate, growth rate of the square root of GA area, and GA perimeter-adjusted growth rate.

Results

GA area growth rate was correlated strongly with mean GA perimeter (r 2 = 0.66). GA area growth rate was associated with baseline GA area (r 2 = 0.39; P < 0.001), lesion number (r 2 = 0.10; P < 0.001), and circularity index (r 2 = 0.28; P < 0.001). The use of the square root of GA area reduced the influence of baseline GA area (but not lesion number or circularity) on GA growth rate. In comparison, GA perimeter-adjusted growth rate (0.098 ± 0.062 mm/year) was not correlated with baseline GA area (r 2 = 0.005; P = 0.20), lesion number (r 2 = 0.00009; P = 0.86), or circularity index (r 2 = 0.007; P = 0.14). GA perimeter-adjusted growth rate was 50.0% higher in eyes whose fellow eyes showed GA at any visit (0.102 ± 0.062 mm/year) than in eyes whose fellow eyes never demonstrated GA during follow-up (0.068 ± 0.049 mm/year).

Conclusions

The growth rate of GA area is associated strongly with lesion perimeter. This relationship explains the previously observed influences of baseline GA size, lesion number, and circularity on GA growth rate. GA perimeter-adjusted growth rate is uncorrelated with the 3 morphologic factors and may serve as a surrogate outcome measure to monitor GA progression in future studies.

### Comparing accuracies of length-type geographic atrophy growth rate metrics using atrophy-front growth modeling [^d30272cf]. Ophthalmology Science (2022). Medium credibility.

Results

Figure 3 shows the effective radiusand the perimeter-adjustedmetrics plotted against the ground truth growth ratesfor each of the configurations of Figure 2. We can see that, as was analytically derived in the Methods, the perimeter adjusted growth rateis a perfect estimator of Λ for isotropic, nonmerging growth patterns (configurations 1, 2, 5, 6, and 7). We also see that, even for configurations violating these requirements (configurations 3, 4, and 8), performs at or near the pixel resolution of the simulation grid (± 6 μm; Appendix 5) for most clinically observed growth rates. In comparison, the effective radius metricperforms relatively poorly for all but the simplest configuration (configuration 1), for which it was designed. Specifically, the effective radius metric is affected by circularity (equation 2), number of lesion foci (equation 3), and lesion merging.

### Deep learning of cell spatial organizations identifies clinically relevant insights in tissue images [^f5bd04a1]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Lung ADC vs SCC classification using Ceograph

We hypothesized that instead of directly using images, which are high-dimensional, a much simpler graph representation of cell spatial organization and nuclei orientation would be informative enough to distinguish the two main histological subtypes of lung cancer, ADC and SCC. Thus, Ceograph, a GCN, was designed to utilize graph data instead of a CNN, which is only able to analyze structured data (Fig. 1b). Ceograph was constructed with three cell spatial interaction-CSIGC layersfollowed by a Subgroup Mean Pooling layer and a Softmax layer. The Ceograph consisted of nodes (nuclei) and edges (representing their spatial interactions). For each node, 11 nuclear morphological features were utilized as input data: nuclear area, convex area, eccentricity, extent, filled area, major axis length, minor axis length, the ratio of perimeter squared to area, perimeter, solidity, and prediction confidence. For each edge, three features were used: the categorical edge type determined by the cell types of both the starting and ending nodes resulting in a total of (n × n types for n cell types), nuclear parallelism, and nuclear closeness. The computation algorithm of a CSIGC layer is illustrated in Fig. 1c and Table 1. The interaction-conditioned graph convolution makes the convolution operation conditioned on the spatial interactions (i.e. edge attributes). Through the Subgroup Mean Pooling layer, only features for tumor nuclei nodes were averaged to focus on contributions from tumor nuclei.

Journal of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography (2023). High credibility.

Analysis of the native and patched RVOT landing zone — standardized CT measurement specifies that a dedicated analysis should quantify cross-sectional dimensions of the RVOT/MPA landing zone and the landing zone length. Evaluation for surgical pulmonary valve replacement (PVR) and balloon expandable TPVR should be done from an ECG gated CT, choosing the phase with the maximal cross-sectional area and length, and this is best performed with a center line technique/curved planar reformats (CPR) along the long axis of the RVOT; alternatively, angulated multiplanar reformats (MPRs) from a 4D/multiphasic dataset can be used, often creating MPRs in both systole and diastole and superimposing them to show dimensions throughout the cardiac cycle. The cardiac phase used for self-expanding TPVR evaluation depends on the valve type and is determined by how the evaluation was performed in the clinical trials. With a centerline technique, the centerline should be aligned with the MPA beginning in the RVOT and extending to the pulmonary artery (PA) bifurcation and to the posterior wall of the pulmonary artery (ridge of the bifurcation); in markedly asymmetric branch PAs, the centerline can be extended onto the dominant branch PA, recognizing that cross sections perpendicular to the centerline may be slightly angled relative to the annular plane, yet the centerline technique takes the entire landing zone length into account. Cross-sectional dimensions should be assessed using a contouring tool to yield perimeter and area plus minimum, maximum and perimeter-derived average diameter, with the contour drawn smoothly to avoid accidental perimeter increase from oblique orientation.

### The genetic basis of apple shape and size unraveled by digital phenotyping [^a8fe2b6b]. G3 (2024). Medium credibility.

Feature extraction for shape and size

From the apple fruit contours obtained from FruitPhenoBox, 1D features for shape and size were systematically processed (Table 1, Fig. 1b). For the points on the fruit contour defined in polar coordinates (Pol), the distance of the point from the center of the coordinate system, i.e. the radius, was used in feature extraction. The points in the Cartesian coordinate system were expressed as individual coordinates for both axes (X measuring fruit diameter and Y measuring fruit length). Different fruit sections were determined as the top (A), bottom (B), left (L), or right (R) half of the fruit, as well as intersections of the fruit halves, i.e. fruit quarters (A.L, A.R, B.L, B.R) and unions of the halves, i.e. the full fruit (AB, LR). Points from the fruit contour derived in Cartesian and polar coordinates within a chosen fruit section were used to calculate different types of features, namely the mean (Av), the standard deviation (SD), the minimum (Min), or maximum (Max) value, the 0.25, 0.50, or 0.75 quartile (Q25, Q50, Q75), the area, the ratio between Max and Min value (RatM), and the Max value relative to the Av value (MaxR). The area was calculated by summing up 1°-radius increments in the specified section. For each type of feature, the absolute value (Abs) was taken from the features extracted on different sections. For the opposite fruit halves, absolute values were first extracted and then the ratio (Rat) and the sum (Sum) were calculated across the fruit halves. The ratio or the sum of top vs bottom halves was calculated as average (Rat. Av and Sum. Av) and SD (Rat.SD and Sum.SD). Hereby, the top and bottom halves were calculated from quarter values using the corresponding left–right fruit quarters (AB.LR). Additionally, symmetry between L and R as well as A and B was calculated as the Av or SD of the difference between corresponding absolute values of radius of each fruit half (Sym.abs, sections LR, and AB). Similarly, the symmetry measure Sym.abs was obtained for individual apple sections A, B, L, and R when comparing the opposite quarters within the fruit halves. Additionally, a relative symmetry (Sym.rel) was derived for the same apple sections as Sym.abs, but the measure Sym.rel was normalized for the area of the apple section.

A threefold increase in nuclear perimeter was also observed (Fig. 3c), in addition to a significant increase in solidity, a measure of the smooth nature of the perimeter (Supplementary Fig. 14a). During progression from normal to DCIS to IDC, patient samples showed interesting, but comparatively small, differences in nuclear morphology (Supplementary Fig. 14b–e).

Notably, YAP nuclear intensity scales with nuclear area, with nuclei from patient samples and 3D culture deviating from the size range observed for positive nuclear YAP intensity (Fig. 3d). Similarly, nuclear YAP intensity scales with nuclear perimeter (Fig. 3e). Positive nuclear YAP intensity also correlated with high solidity, which is almost exclusively observed in nuclei from 2D culture (Supplementary Fig. 14f). However, some nuclei from soft 2D PAM reach the required size ranges but fail to show positive nuclear YAP intensity, suggesting that nuclear morphology is not the only factor required for YAP activation.

### Comparing accuracies of length-type geographic atrophy growth rate metrics using atrophy-front growth modeling [^fbef3263]. Ophthalmology Science (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To compare the accuracies of the previously proposed square-root-transformed and perimeter-adjusted metrics for estimating length-type geographic atrophy (GA) growth rates.

Design

Cross-sectional and simulation-based study.

Participants

Thirty-eight eyes with GA from 27 patients.

Methods

We used a previously developed atrophy-front growth model to provide analytical and numerical evaluations of the square-root-transformed and perimeter-adjusted growth rate metrics on simulated and semisimulated GA growth data.

Main Outcome Measures

Comparison of the accuracies of the square-root-transformed and perimeter-adjusted metrics on simulated and semisimulated GA growth data.

Results

Analytical and numerical evaluations showed that the accuracy of the perimeter-adjusted metric is affected minimally by baseline lesion area, focality, and circularity over a wide range of GA growth rates. Average absolute errors of the perimeter-adjusted metric were approximately 20 times lower than those of the square-root-transformed metrics, per evaluation on a semisimulated dataset with growth rate characteristics matching clinically observed data.

Conclusions

Length-type growth rates have an intuitive, biophysical interpretation that is independent of lesion geometry, which supports their use in clinical trials of GA therapeutics. Taken in the context of prior studies, our analyses suggest that length-type GA growth rates should be measured using the perimeter-adjusted metric, rather than square-root-transformed metrics.

### Digital morphometry and cluster analysis identifies four types of melanocyte during uveal melanoma progression [^472b2865]. Communications Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Digital image analysis

After sectioning and staining, all glass slides were digitally scanned at ×400 (Ocus 40, Grundium Oy, Tampere, Finland). Analyses of cell morphometric features and IHC expression levels were performed with QuPath Bioimage analysis v. 0.3.2. The software was run on a standard off-the-shelf desktop computer (Apple Inc. Cupertino, CA).

For assessment of the levels of BAP-1, IGF-1R, IDO, and TIGIT expression, one positive cell and one negative cell, as manually selected by a pathologist (GS), was calibrated in each digitally scanned tissue section. This adjusts for differences in general staining intensity and color nuance between different slides. A polygon was then drawn around the margins of the tumor. Areas with inflammatory infiltrates, bleeding, heavy pigmentation, necrosis, poor fixation, uneven staining, and artefactual folding were excluded. Each section was also evaluated in high magnification to exclude any areas with tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, granulocytes, macrophages, fibroblasts, hepatocytes (in the liver), and other potentially false positive cells. Segmentation parameters were setup by a pathologist in the positive cell detection tool. Based on randomly selected areas of normal choroid, nevi, primary tumors, and metastases, a background radius of 8 µm; a sigma of 2 µm; a minimum nucleus area of 10 µm 2; a maximum nucleus area of 200 µm 2; and a cell (cytoplasm) expansion of 3.5 µm, was deemed to appropriately capture the shape and size of melanocytes. A full list of the used parameters and visual examples are provided in Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 1, respectively. The following morphometric and staining characteristics of all cells inside the polygon were then measured, as described previously: area of the nucleus; nucleus perimeter; nucleus circularity (calculated as four times π times the area divided by the perimeter squared. The circularity of a circle is 1.00, and less for less circular objects); nucleus maximum caliper; nucleus minimum caliper; nucleus eccentricity (a measure of how much the nucleus deviates from a spherical shape. A completely spherical nucleus has an eccentricity of 0.00, a nucleus with the shape of an elliptical 3D solid would have an eccentricity of 0.5, whereas a 3D conical distribution has a value of 1.00); nucleus hematoxylin mean optical density (OD), nuclear BAP-1 (nBAP-1) mean OD, cytoplasm BAP-1 mean OD, and the nucleus to cell area ratio. IGF-1R expression levels were measured in cell membranes, and IDO and TIGIT in cytoplasms. A full list with a description of the analyzed morphometric and staining characteristics is provided in Supplementary Table 2. Morphometric analyses were performed blinded to all other patient data including outcome.

Simulations with Simplified Lesion Geometries and Growth Fields

Figure 2 illustrates a hierarchy of simplified, simulated lesion geometries and growths whose rows are arranged according to focality and whose columns are arranged according to a subjective complexity of lesion geometry and growth pattern. All lesions of Figure 2 were constructed to correspond to Δ t = 1 year follow-up intervals to have equal baseline areas of A (t b) = 6 mm 2 and to have equal length-type growth rates of Λ = 0.1 mm/year, the latter of which approximately corresponds to the reported mean of the 1-year perimeter adjusted growth rates of the AREDS dataset. Mathematical specifications of the lesion geometries and growth fields are given in Appendix 5. Using the terminology of Table 1, configurations 1 through 3 represent a progression of geometric complexity, moving from a circle (configuration 1) to an ellipse (configuration 2) to a notched shape (configuration 3). Relevant to growth rate estimation, configurations 1 and 2 both are convex shapes, and therefore isotropic growth never results in intrafocus merging (Appendix 3); however, configuration 2 is noncircular (i.e. has a circularity index of < 1), and therefore results in errors when assessed using square-root-transformed metrics (equation 2). Configuration 3 has a nonconvex geometry, and therefore, lesion growth can lead to intrafocus merging, which has the effect of censoring GA growth, making growth estimation ill-posed for any metric (Appendix 3). Compared with configurations 1 through 3, configuration 4 corresponds to an anisotropic growth field, which causes the baseline circular lesion to grow into a more complex, nonconvex geometry. In the second row, although the baseline lesion shapes are all circular, bifocality results in estimation errors when using square-root-transformed metrics (equation 3). Configurations 5 and 6 correspond to different distributions of lesion area between the foci. Configuration 7 corresponds to an anisotropic growth field, constructed so that the lesion growth rate of each lesion focus is constant, but with the rate of the top left lesion being half that of the bottom right lesion. Finally, unlike configurations 5 through 7, configuration 8 involves merging of the 2 lesion foci (i.e. interfoci merging). Evaluations of metric accuracy were performed by scaling the growth fields (but not the baseline lesion geometries) so as to vary Λ through a range of 0.05 to 0.7 mm/year (Appendix 5).

Analysis of cell parameters

The distance between DCL cells was computed as the angle between the centre of mass position times the egg sphere radius (distance on the sphere surface). DCL-EVL cell edge distance was computed as the shortest distance of the DCL cell centre of mass to the EVL cell membrane. DCL and EVL cell area were computed using a polygonal contour approximation of the perimeters and using a line integral based on Green's Theorem implemented in the sphereint Matlab function. The DCL covered area was estimated by identifying DCL cells in the 2D projected convex hull of the DCL centres, ignoring the z -component, and then computing the area with the described line integral approach. For cell shape parameters, the three principal axes were computed from the segmented image using second-order moments. The first axis defines the orientation of maximum variance and is proportional to the variance magnitude (λ 1) defining an object length; secondary and tertiary axis are orthogonal and define in the same way width and height with associated sizes λ 2 and λ 3, respectively. Elongation is defined as 1− λ 2 / λ 1 and flatness as 1− λ 3 / λ 2, with both indexes in the interval [0,1]. The entropy index is computed as −∑ λ ′ i log(λ ′ i), where λ ′ i = λ i /∑ λ i, thus it accounts for cell elongation heterogeneity (entropy index is maximum when all indexes are equal). The eccentricity index corresponds to the distance between foci and major axis length of an ellipse with the same second-moments as the cell. Cell trajectory directionality was estimated as the ratio of displacement over trajectory length both in 3D. Nearest neighbour distance was computed by building the distance matrix connecting all DCL cells on the sphere surface and averaging the three closest distances. The mean square displacement for DCL cells was calculated by taking a sliding temporal window (of 1 to 25 frames) and computing the track displacement as the 3D Euclidean distance between initial and final window frames. Linear regression (using Matlab Curve Fitting Toolbox with least-squares option) reporting r 2 value was applied to study the relation between the EVL total area and DCL covered area during epiboly. To all parameter pairs, when normally distributed, a t -test was used to verify whether mean values differences were statistically significant. For other distributions, a Wilcoxon test was used.

### Healthy housing reference manual [^5322837b]. CDC (2006). Medium credibility.

Termite prevention for homes — according to Potter, homeowners can reduce the risk for termite attack by adhering to the following suggestions: eliminate wood contact with the ground, do not allow moisture to accumulate near the home's foundation, and reduce humidity in crawl spaces. Most building codes state that crawl space area should be vented at a rate of 1 square foot per 150 square feet of crawl space area; this rate can be reduced for crawl spaces equipped with a polyethylene or equivalent vapor barrier to one square foot per 300 to 500 square feet of crawl space area, and vent placement design includes positioning one vent within 3 feet of each building corner with a minimum of two vents per side.

### Recommendations for cardiac chamber quantification by echocardiography in adults: an update from the American Society of Echocardiography and the European association of cardiovascular imaging [^6a46fa06]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2015). Medium credibility.

Echocardiographic left ventricular (LV) volumes — Volume measurements are "usually based on tracings of the blood-tissue interface in the apical four- and two-chamber views", with the contour at the mitral valve level "closed by connecting the two opposite sections of the mitral ring with a straight line", and LV length "defined as the distance between the middle of this line and the most distant point of the LV contour". Techniques include biplane disk summation and area-length; biplane disk summation advantages are "Corrects for shape distortions" and "Less geometrical assumptions compared with linear dimensions", with limitations "Apex frequently foreshortened", "Endocardial dropout", and "Blind to shape distortions not visualized in the apical two- and four-chamber planes". For area-length, the advantage is "Partial correction for shape distortion", with limitations "Apex frequently foreshortened", "Heavily based on geometrical assumptions", and "Limited published data on normal population".

### Trigonometric characteristics of episiotomy and risks for obstetric anal sphincter injuries in operative vaginal delivery [^f905d398]. International Urogynecology Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction and Hypothesis

The objective of this study was to investigate the association between the trigonometric properties of episiotomy in operative vaginal delivery (OVD) and obstetric anal sphincter injuries (OASIS).

Methods

The study included 72 primiparous women who had an OVD and episiotomy. Cases (n = 36) had sustained OASIS at birth, while controls (n = 36) had not. The groups were matched for instrumental delivery. The episiotomy scar was identified and its trigonometric characteristics were measured at 8–12 weeks postpartum. Data were analysed using conditional logistic analysis.

Results

The angle of episiotomy behaves as a factor associated with anal sphincter injury, so women with a mediolateral episiotomy and an angle greater than 20° have an 87% less risk of having an OASIS (odds ratio 0.13, 95% confidence interval 0.03–0.58). The study showed that scarred episiotomies at 8–12 weeks after OVD with an angle ≤ 20°, depth and distance between the episiotomy and anus ≤ 15 mm, total upper triangle perimeter ≤ 75 mm, para-anal triangle perimeter ≤ 15 mm and areas between scar and midline ≤ 250 mm(2) were significantly associated with higher risk of OASIS.

Conclusions

When a mediolateral episiotomy is performed in OVD the technique has a strong effect on the occurrence of OASIS. Additional research is needed to determine if the optimal technique for mediolateral episiotomies produces less OASIS than deferring the performance of episiotomy.

### Recommendations for quantification methods during the performance of a pediatric echocardiogram: a report from the pediatric measurements writing group of the American Society of Echocardiography pediatric and congenital heart disease council [^1398ac87]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2010). Medium credibility.

Atrioventricular (AV) valves morphometric evaluation — measurement of mitral valve (MV) and tricuspid valve (TV) size helps characterize valvar pathology and diagnose ventricular hypoplasia, with annular diameter and area measured by 2D and 3D imaging; annular area may also be estimated from a single-plane diameter using the area formula for a circle, but because the MV annulus is elliptical and saddle-like in shape a more accurate estimate can be obtained with orthogonal diameters using the area formula for an ellipse, and published pediatric normative databases have used annular diameters measured in apical 4-chamber (lateral diameter) and parasternal long-axis (anteroposterior diameter) views to calculate MV and TV elliptical annular areas.

### Recommendations for cardiac chamber quantification by echocardiography in adults: an update from the American Society of Echocardiography and the European association of cardiovascular imaging [^79b1194c]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2015). Medium credibility.

Echocardiographic assessment of right atrial (RA) size — volume by 2D describes that "2D volumetric measurements are usually based on tracings of the blood-tissue interface on the apical four-chamber view" and that "At the tricuspid valve level, the contour is closed by connecting the two opposite sections of the tricuspid ring with a straight line". It adds, "Volumes can be computed by using either the single plane area-length" or "the disks summation technique", performed in a "2D view". The listed advantage is "More representative of actual RA size than linear dimensions", while limitations include "Assumes a symmetrical shape of the cavity", "Single plane volume calculation may be inaccurate since it assumes that RA enlargement is symmetrical", and "Normal values not well established".

Left atrial (LA) volume measurement methodology — when assessing LA size and remodeling, the measurement of LA volume is recommended; LA volume should be measured using the disk summation algorithm with LA endocardial borders traced in both apical four- and two-chamber views, while single-plane methods are not recommended for routine use though they can be used when both-view planimetry is difficult, and single-plane apical four-chamber indexed volumes are typically 1 to 2 mL/m2 smaller than apical two-chamber values; a biplane area–length calculation is an alternative.

### Human V4 size predicts crowding distance [^d250125a]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Relationship between A and λ

We quantified the relationship between A, cortical map surface area, and λ, number of letters in the uncrowded visual field, in two ways. First, we computed the correlation (Pearson's r) and covariance between the two variables. These calculations treat the two variables symmetrically. We visualize the covariance ellipses at 1-SD and 2-SD, scaling the x and y axes so that one standard deviation of each variable is the same length (Fig. 3a). This ensures that the covariance ellipses are circular when the correlation is 0. Second, to explicitly test for conservation, we fit a linear model to A (independent variable) and λ (dependent variable), with the intercept set to 0, and asked how much of the variance in λ is explained (Fig. 3c). Note that the variance explained can be negative, because a line through the origin may be a worse predictor (larger residuals in λ) than just assuming the mean (a horizontal line). For both the correlation coefficient and the variance explained, 68% confidence intervals were calculated by bootstrapping participants with replacement (n = 10000).

The relationship between A and λ depends on how we compute λ. We measured radial but not tangential crowding distance, so we estimated the tangential crowding distance by assuming that all participants have the same fixed 2:1 ratio of radial to tangential crowding, based on mean values reported by Kurzawski et al.and Toet and Levi. We simulated two cases to estimate how much this assumption affects our estimates of λ. In one case, we assigned each participant a ratio of radial to tangential crowding drawn from a Gaussian distribution with a 2:1 mean and the standard deviation reported by Kurzawski et al. In the other case, everyone was assigned the same 2:1, with zero variance. The change in variance only slightly changed estimates of λ. The estimates of λ in the two cases are 88% correlated. If we treat this discrepancy as measurement noise, correcting for it {} would slightly increase the estimated underlying correlation r between λ and V4 A, from 0.65 to 0.74. The point is just that the measured correlation depends only weakly on the variance of the radial-to-tangential ratio.

### Placental morphology in association with autism-related traits in the EARLI study [^e871c2a4]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Placental features

Placental tissue was collected at the time of childbirth and preserved in a sealed bag with formalin. Placental gross morphology measures were collected by a trained pathologist following a standard protocol. Features that broadly capture placental shape and cord irregularity characteristics were measured and calculated as previously described. After trimming the extraplacental membranes and umbilical cord, 2D digital images of the fetal placental chorionic surface shape were taken, to measure the umbilical cord insertion site, perimeter, area, and the sliced placental disk site, according to central slice along the visibly longest diameter through the insertion point. The placental perimeter was calculated from the traced chorionic disk shape by counting the edge pixels. The umbilical distance from centroid (also known as cord centrality) was calculated as the distance between umbilical cord and centroid of the placenta as determined from the traced 2D fetal surface image. Placental eccentricity was captured according to 1) cord eccentricity, defined as the ratio of the maximum:minimum radius from the umbilical insertion point, and 2) shape eccentricity (also known as placental ellipsivity), defined as the ratio of the maximum:minimum radius from the geometric center. For both measures, a value of 1 indicates low eccentricity (a centrally inserted umbilical cord for the former and a round placenta for the latter). Following our prior work, variables examined here included placental weight at delivery (grams), perimeter (cm), area (cm 2), umbilical cord distance from center (also called cord centrality; cm), radius (cm, measured as radius from geometric center to the perimeter of the placental disk measured per degree, as median, minimum, and maximum values), the aforementioned eccentricity measures, and thickness (cm) of the placenta disk slice (including maximum, mean, standard deviation). In addition, the fetoplacental ratio, the ratio of birthweight to placental weight, was calculated. These gross variables are also listed and defined in eTable 1. We also decided to use the k-means clustering analysis of additional placental variables as the exploratory analysis to gain a more complete understanding of the association between placental morphology features and autism-related outcomes.

### The sensitivity of the scapholunate interval and bony landmarks to wrist rotation on posteroanterior radiographs [^196936dd]. Hand (2025). Medium credibility.

Radiographs were exported as TIFF files to the hard drive of a workstation for analysis. The 4 proposed landmarks, as well as the SL interval, were evaluated on each radiograph using ImageJ, Version 1.53q (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland).

The first author measured the SL interval according to the protocol outlined by Said et al, which was further confirmed via consensus with 2 independent hand surgeons blinded to the degree of rotation in each film. Once the SL interval was measured for each subject's rotation sequence, the values were normalized to the subject's largest SL interval across the entire rotation sequence, expressed as a percentage. This gave results as a percentage of the maximum visible SL interval, an attempt to normalize anatomical variation in the SL interval among subjects.

The following radiographic landmarks were measured on each radiograph: the length of the visible portion of the margin of the hook of the hamate (teardrop), the ratio of the radial and ulnar area of the dorsal nonarticular surface of the head of the third metacarpal (balanced metacarpal heads), the ratio of the radial and ulnar area of the pisiform about the ulnar longitudinal axis to the total pisiform area (pisiform position), and the percentage of the triquetral area overlapped by the pisiform (pisiform overlap). The detailed measurement protocol for each landmark is as follows:

Teardrop

The circumferential border of the hook of the hamate is demarcated by a layer of cortical bone and appears as a crisp, radiopaque outline. The length of the unbroken visible circumferential perimeter of the proximal base of the hook of the hamate was measured, tracing radially to ulnarly for each specimen (Figure 2b). Once the perimeter was measured for each subject's rotation sequence, the values were normalized to the subject's largest perimeter across the entire rotation sequence, expressed as a percentage. This gave results as a percentage of the maximum visible perimeter, an attempt to normalize anatomical variation in the hook of the hamate among subjects.

Annulus measurements

The annulus measurements were performed semi-automatically with the "edge finder" tool available in the reconstruction software (IntelliSpace Portal). With this tool, two seed points are placed somewhere inside the annulus and in the tissues surrounding the aortic root, respectively. Thereafter, the software automatically defines the contour of the annulus where there is a sharp transition of Hounsfield unit values between the contrast-enhanced lumen and surrounding tissues. For each phase, the automatically traced contour was checked and adjusted when deemed necessary. The contour was modified to encircle the inner edge of small calcifications and to extend over big calcifications in continuity with the adjacent outline. The maximum diameter, the diameter perpendicular to the maximum (referred to as "the minimum diameter"), the area, and the perimeter were recorded (Fig. 3). The average diameter was calculated as the average of the maximum and minimum. The effective diameter was derived from the area. The asymmetry ratio (AR) and relative area (RA) were calculated as previously defined. The AR was defined as the ratio between the maximum and the minimum diameter. The RA was calculated as the ratio between the area at each individual phase and the average area of all phases throughout the cycle.

### Recommendations for cardiac chamber quantification by echocardiography in adults: an update from the American Society of Echocardiography and the European association of cardiovascular imaging [^194fdbe5]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2015). Medium credibility.

Left atrial (LA) volume quantification by echocardiography is described using two-dimensional echocardiography (2DE) and three-dimensional (3D) approaches, with 2D volumetric measurements based on tracings from apical four- and two-chamber views; at the mitral valve level the contour is closed by a straight line, endocardial tracing excludes the atrial appendage and pulmonary veins, LA length L is the shortest long axis from apical two- and four-chamber views, and the two lengths should not differ more than 5 mm; volumes can be computed by an area-length approximation or by a disk summation technique, and 3D data sets are usually acquired from the apical approach using a multibeat full-volume acquisition. For the 2DE area-length technique, advantages include accurate assessment of asymmetric remodeling of the left atrium and being a more robust predictor of cardiovascular events than linear or area measurements, whereas limitations include geometric assumptions about LA shape, few accumulated data on normal population, and that single plane volume calculations are inaccurate because they assume A1 = A2. For 3D data sets, advantages are no geometrical assumption about LA shape and greater accuracy compared with 2D measurements, while limitations include dependence on adequate image quality, lower temporal resolution, limited data on normal values, and that patient's cooperation is required.

Small mesenteric arteries were also studied as pressurized systems to assess vascular structure and mechanical properties. In basal conditions, there were no structural differences between any groups as assessed by measuring cross‐sectional area (Figure 6 A) and wall‐to‐lumen ratio (Figure S4 A). Cross‐sectional area was increased in all Ang II–infused groups (Figure 6 B and 6 C), with modest effect in Nox5‐expressing mice compared with WT mice. In Ang II–infused mice, wall‐to‐lumen ratio was increased in Nox5 + SM22 + mice compared with WT and vehicle‐treated Nox5 + /SM22 + counterparts (Figure S4 C and S4 D). Vascular stiffness and distensibility, assessed by stress/strain relationships, were not significantly different between any groups (Figure S5).

### Bézier curves as a total approach to measure the upper lid contour: redefining clinical outcomes in palpebral surgery [^b33791a9]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2023). Medium credibility.

Aims

To define and quantify the upper lid contour by adapting Bézier curves with a newly developed software in normal subjects, assessing their reliability.

Methods

Fifty eyes of 50 healthy patients with no ocular pathology were included in this study from October 2020 to November 2020. All measurements were performed on Bézier curves adjusted to the upper lid contour. An original software was used to measure the radial and vertical midpupil-to-lid margin distances (MPLD), temporal-to-nasal (T/N) ratios, contour peak location and grade of superposition (GS) and asymmetry (GA) indexes. We calculated differences in the variables measured regarding age, gender or the side of the eye being assessed.

Results

The mean Bézier curve showed an excellent level of inter-rater reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.99). The median GS index of each eyelid to the mean Bézier curve was 95.4%, 8.5 IQR, and the median GA index was 3%, 3.4 IQR. The mean contour peak location was -0.35mm, SD 0.45. Overall, the mean central MPLD was 4.1mm, SD 0.6. No significant differences were found between male and female patients in variables derived from Bézier curves.

Conclusion

Bézier curves may become a very useful tool for the assessment of upper lid contour, contour peak and symmetry. GS and GA indexes, along with the T/N area ratio are potential outcomes for this purpose. All current variables can be obtained just from one single Bézier curve measurement. Our results offer an in-depth exhaustive description of these variables and their distribution in the normal population.

### Strain and morphological changes of median nerve after carpal tunnel release [^ca39fa5f]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Objectives

Characterization of the changes of ultrasound parameters after carpal tunnel release may be useful for clarifying the effectiveness or the recovery process of the carpal tunnel syndrome treatment. We evaluated strain and morphological changes of the median nerve before and after carpal tunnel release in carpal tunnel syndrome patients.

Methods

Twenty-two wrists of 20 idiopathic carpal tunnel syndrome patients who underwent open carpal tunnel release were evaluated by ultrasound. Cross-sectional images of the median nerve were obtained at the proximal carpal tunnel. The cross-sectional area, perimeter, aspect ratio of the minimum enclosing rectangle, and strain of the median nerve were measured and compared before and after carpal tunnel release. According to the patient's recovery, the areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) were compared among the parameters.

Results

After carpal tunnel release, the area and perimeter significantly decreased, and the strain significantly increased compared with before carpal tunnel release. There were no significant changes in the aspect ratio after carpal tunnel release. The AUCs were 0.663, 0.643, 0.543, and 0.731 for the area, perimeter, aspect ratio, and strain, respectively.

Conclusions

Significant decreases in median nerve area and perimeter as well as significant increases in median nerve strain were observed after carpal tunnel release. The results of this study may be useful when considering how the median nerve recovers after carpal tunnel release.

### Best-fit circle missing area method shows good accuracy and interrater reliability when assessing glenoid bone loss [^d52056c3]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The amount of glenoid bone loss (GBL) in anterior shoulder instability helps determine management options. Unfortunately, there is no consensus on how to accurately measure GBL.

Hypothesis

The best-fit circle missing area method has better accuracy and interrater reliability than the ratio and diameter methods.

Study Design

Controlled laboratory study.

Methods

Three-dimensional computed tomography shoulder scans were collected and segmented on 4 healthy male participants (mean age, 22.5 ± 3.4 years). For each scapula, 5 GBL models were created with known levels of GBL (5%-30%) in the anteroinferior glenoid rim. Ground-truth GBL was determined using the glenoid fossa edge and best-fit circle of the anteroinferior edge. Six blinded reviewers with varying expertise measured GBL for 20 randomized models using 3 different best-fit circle methods (missing area, ratio, and diameter). Accuracy was assessed by root mean square error and obtained by comparing measured and ground truth for bone loss for each model. Interrater reliability was assessed using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) with a 2-way random-effects model with consistency.

Results

On average, the missing area method overestimated GBL by 1%, while the ratio method and diameter method overestimated GBL by 2.4% and 6.3%, respectively. The interrater reliabilities of the missing area (ICC, 0.89), ratio (ICC, 0.91), and diameter (ICC, 0.90) methods were good, excellent, and good, respectively. For all reviewers, the overall root mean square error of the missing area method (3.6%) was better than that of the ratio (5%) and diameter (7.9%) methods. When stratifying reviewer accuracy by level of training, the missing area method remained superior at all levels when compared with the ratio and diameter methods (attending [3.1% vs 3.8% and 8.9%], fellow [4.2% vs 6.3% and 8.4%], and resident [3.5% vs 4.6% and 6.3%]).

Conclusion

The best-fit circle missing area method was reliable and more accurate at measuring GBL than the other methods. This held true at all levels of surgical experience (resident, fellow, and attending).

Clinical Relevance

The best-fit circle missing area method is accurate, has good reliability, and is simple. This can enhance preoperative planning for shoulder surgeons.

### 2022 ACC / AHA guideline for the diagnosis and management of aortic Disease: a report of the American Heart Association / American college of cardiology joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^471bba77]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

Ascending aortic aneurysm risk indices and thresholds — data highlight limitations of absolute diameter and describe adjunctive measures. Data from the IRAD showed that ~60% of patients with acute type A aortic dissection had maximal aortic diameters of < 5.5 cm at presentation, and most patients with aneurysms < 5.5 cm who are managed medically do not suffer aortic dissection or rupture, so absolute aortic diameter is far from an ideal predictor of risk. A single-center large database of TAA was reevaluated with indexing of aortic diameter to body surface area (BSA) (ASI) or height (AHI) to improve prediction, and a cross-sectional aortic area to patient height ratio of ≥ 10 cm2/m was found to correlate with increased mortality among unoperated patients with root or ascending aortic aneurysms; use of the area to height ratio is most appropriate in patients whose height is > 1 standard deviation above or below the mean. Recommendations for prophylactic repair at aortic diameters of < 5.5 cm have been proposed but not systematically tested in large-scale multicenter trials, and experienced surgeons in a Multidisciplinary Aortic Team may consider the use of such ratios when determining the optimal timing of intervention.

### Technique of area measurement of epithelial defects [^65394279]. Cornea (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose

To compare two commonly used methods of area measurement of corneal epithelial defects, namely, estimation of the area of an equivalent rectangle and use of image analysis software, the gold standard.

Methods

Thirty-eight patients with corneal epithelial defects were evaluated. The largest linear dimension of the epithelial defect and its largest possible perpendicular within the confines of the epithelial defect were measured using a slit lamp. The area was then measured using digital photographs and image analysis software. A paired sample t test was used to compare the results.

Results

The two measurements of area correlated well (P = 0.84); their difference was insignificant (P = 0.063) and a linear regression relation between the two could be derived with an r2 value of 0.71, which was significant.

Conclusions

Accurate slit-lamp measurements with estimation of the area of an equivalent rectangle can safely be used as a measure of the epithelial defect size when sophisticated image analysis software is not available.

### Bicuspid aortic valve annulus: assessment of geometry and size changes during the cardiac cycle as measured with a standardized method to define the annular plane [^6bf20f85]. European Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) is a complex malformation affecting not merely the aortic valve. However, little is known regarding the dynamic physiology of the aortic annulus in these patients and whether it is similar to tricuspid aortic valves (TAV). Determining the BAV annular plane is more challenging than for TAV. Our aim was to present a standardized methodology to determine BAV annulus and investigate its changes in shape and dimensions during the cardiac cycle.

Methods

BAV patients were prospectively included and underwent an ECG-gated cardiac CTA. The annulus plane was manually identified on reconstructions at 5% intervals of the cardiac cycle with a new standardized method for different BAV types. Based on semi-automatically defined contours, maximum and minimum diameter, area, area-derived diameter, perimeter, asymmetry ratio (AR), and relative area were calculated. Differences of dynamic annular parameters were assessed also per BAV type.

Results

Of the 55 patients included (38.4 ± 13.3 years; 58% males), 38 had BAV Sievers type 1, 10 type 0, and 7 type 2. The minimum diameter, perimeter, area, and area-derived diameter were significantly higher in systole than in diastole with a relative change of 13.7%, 4.8%, 13.7%, and 7.2% respectively (all p < 0.001). The AR was ≥ 1.1 in all phases, indicating an elliptic shape, with more pronounced flattening in diastole (p < 0.001). Different BAV types showed comparable dynamic changes.

Conclusions

BAV annulus undergo significant changes in shape during the cardiac cycle with a wider area in systole and a more elliptic conformation in diastole regardless of valve type.

Key Points

- A refined method for the identification of the annulus plane on CT scans of patients with bicuspid aortic valves, tailored for the specific anatomy of each valve type, is proposed.
- The annulus of patients with bicuspid aortic valves undergoes significant changes during the cardiac cycle with a wider area and more circular shape in systole regardless of valve type.
- As compared to previously published data, the bicuspid aortic valve annulus has physiological dynamics similar to that encountered in tricuspid valves but with overall larger dimensions.

ASNC 123I-mIBG heart-to-mediastinum ratio (HMR) derivation — ROI placement and calculation: At present the standard is to manually draw the cardiac and mediastinal regions of interest (ROI); the currently accepted method is an irregular ROI defining the epicardial border of the heart, the mediastinum is an approximately square ROI (7 × 7 pixels) in the upper mediastinum below the lung apices and midway between the lungs with positioning in the area of lowest counts, and the HMR is then calculated by dividing the mean counts/pixel in the total myocardium ROI by the mean counts/pixel in the mediastinal ROI; the technique appears to be fairly robust with a recent study showing only minimal, inconsequential changes in HMR when there are changes in the visually defined heart ROI.

The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

Study outcomes

The primary endpoint was the least square (LS) mean change from baseline in square root transformed area (mm) of RORA in each of the three treatment arms (PM, PEOM and sham pooled) at 12 months.RORA is used to enable analyses requiring a continuous variable while encompassing both early atrophic changes (iRORA) and GA (cRORA). Secondary endpoints included square root change in area of CAM-defined constituent features of RORA — RPE loss, hypertransmission and PRD. Isolated PRD and intact macula (within the ETDRS grid) were introduced as novel clinical outcomes. In addition to area (mm 2) by feature, baseline measurements included demographic information, perimeter of the lesion and its focality. Predictive values for GA growth of the total PRD to RPE loss ratio; of PRD in isolation; and of intact macula (all measured at baseline) were also study endpoints.

Due to GA's non-uniform topographical distribution and its propensity for extra-foveal sites, feature-specific area analysis was conducted by ETDRS region of interest (foveal, perifoveal and parafoveal as well as regions 1–9) to evaluate change in area of these features over time in the form of square root change in area and per cent occupancy (measured as area of degeneration/total area of individual region).

Statistical analyses

All data analyses were conducted using R provided in the public domain by R Core team 2020 R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria. Most features at baseline were not normally distributed (inspected visually with quantile–quantile plots and Shapiro-Wilk normality test p value < 0.05); therefore, the Wilcoxon rank test was used for baseline comparisons. Statistical tests were two-sided with alpha = 0.05. LS means and their 95% CIs were estimated from a mixed effect model with a random intercept at the level of the patient that included treatment and visit as factors and baseline RORA lesion as a covariate, as well as cross-level interactions of treatment×visit and visit×baseline.

Predicting GA growth

Per annum GA growth rate was calculated as the difference in RORA area from baseline to month 12 and considered as a dependent variable in a regression model. Coefficient of determination (R 2) was computed and reported from 100-fold bootstrapped multivariable regression models. Independent variables are: ratio of total PRD to RPE loss at baseline; area of isolated PRD at baseline; and intact macula at baseline.

### Predicting heart failure hospitalization and mortality by quantitative echocardiography: is body surface area the indexing method of choice? The heart and soul study [^131b27e3]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Echocardiographic measurements of left ventricular (LV) mass, left atrial (LA) volume, and LV end-systolic volume (ESV) predict heart failure (HF) hospitalization and mortality. Indexing measurements by body size is thought to establish limits of normality among individuals varying in body habitus. The American Society of Echocardiography recommends dividing measurements by body surface area (BSA), but others have advocated alternative indexing methods.

Methods

Echocardiographic measurements were collected in 1024 ambulatory adults with coronary artery disease. LV mass, LA volume, and LV ESV were calculated using truncated ellipse method and biplane method of disk formulae. Comparison between raw measurements and measurements divided by indexing parameters was made by hazard ratios per standard deviation increase in variable and c-statistics for BSA, BSA(0.43), BSA(1.5), height, height(0.25), height(2), height(2.7), body weight (BW), BW(0.26), body mass index (BMI), and BMI(0.27).

Results

Mean LV mass was 192 ± 57 g, mean LA volume was 65 ± 24 mL, and mean LV ESV was 41 ± 26 mL. Average height was 171 ± 9 cm, average BSA was 1.94 ± 0.22 m(2), and average BMI was 28.4 ± 5.3 kg/m(2). At an average follow-up of 5.6 ± 1.8 years, there were 148 HF hospitalizations, 71 cardiovascular (CV) deaths, and 269 all-cause deaths. There was excellent correlation between raw measurements and those indexed by height (r = 0.98–0.99), and moderate correlation between raw measurements and those indexed by BW (r = 0.73–0.94). C-statistics and hazard ratios per standard deviation increase in indexed variables were similar for HF hospitalization, CV mortality, and all-cause mortality. There were no significant differences among indexing methods in ability to predict outcomes.

Conclusion

The choice of indexing method by parameters of BSA, height, BW, and BMI does not affect the clinical usefulness of LV mass, LA volume, and LV ESV in predicting HF hospitalization, CV mortality, or all-cause mortality among ambulatory adults with coronary artery disease. Continued use of BSA to index measurements of LV mass, LA volume, and LV ESV is acceptable.

ALS data

ALS data were acquired during leaf-on periods between 2007 and 2018, depending on the region (see Supplementary Table 2). The same pre-processing and metrics-calculation methods were applied over the ALS datasets of all five forest regions. LAStools was used in pre-processing, coordinate transformation, outlier filtering, the classification of the returns into ground and non-ground and the normalisation of the height of the vegetation returns to the height above ground level.

Based on the normalised height, metrics characterising the three-dimensional forest structure were calculated (Supplementary Table 3). The mean and maximum height of the vegetation returns were determined as information on forest maturity, and the standard deviation and coefficient of variation to characterise the vertical variability of the vegetation distribution. Canopy cover as well as the average and variability of the vegetation height are among the most significant predictors of animal species diversity. To characterise the development of canopy sub-layers, the penetration ratios were calculated by dividing the number of returns blocked (or captured) by each sub-layer by the number of returns that reached the layer. Penetration ratios were calculated for three sub-layers: canopy (above 5 m), understory (2–5 m) and regeneration layers (below 2 m). Foliage height diversity was then derived using the Shannon entropy index and the penetration ratios of the three sub-layers. The canopy cover was also determined based on the penetration ratio of the canopy and the understorey layer (above 2 m).

Spatial heterogeneity composed of forest gaps were considered by calculating the square-root-transformed total edge length of gap and gap area. Both were determined based on a gap mask raster obtained by mapping pixels with a penetration ratio of the canopy-understory layer < 20% and aggregating neighbouring gap pixels into gap features. Gap features smaller than 50 m² or narrower than a perimeter-area-ratio < 1.5 were excluded. Lastly, a canopy surface height model (CHM) with a spatial resolution of 1 m was developed according to Khosravipour et al.and using the lidR package. Based on the CHM, the ratio of the canopy surface area to the flat area and the standard deviation of the CHM were calculated.

Each of these outputs, the binarized vessel area, skeletonized vessel length, and vessel perimeter maps were utilized in the calculation of perfusion parameters described in the following section. For all vessel parameters, quantification was limited to a circular area of radius 2.8 mm, centered in the middle of the ONH. This compensated for off-centering of the ONH and isolated the immediate peripapillary region for analysis. The area of analysis was further divided into quadrants for sectoral comparison with OCT RNFL thickness (Figure 2) and hemispheres for comparison with VF data.

Using the binarized vessel map output, VAD was calculated as a unitless ratio of the total white image area (A (i, j)), representing vasculature, to the total image area (X (i, j)):

VAD provides comprehensive information about both perfused medium vessels and capillaries in each en face OCTA image.

Using the skeletonized vessel map output, VSD was calculated as the ratio of the combined length of the one-pixel-wide vasculature (S (i, j)) to the total image area (X (i, j), the unit of measurement being pixel/pixel:

Since vessel diameter was equalized in the skeletonized map, VSD emphasized perfused capillary-level vasculature and was thus a suitable marker for capillary density.

Using both the binarized vessel area map and the vessel perimeter map, the VCI was calculated by squaring the sum of the pixels on the perimeters of the vessels (P (i, j)) and dividing by 4π times the area of vasculature (A (i, j)):

This algorithm is widely applied in the digital image processing literatureand potentially well-suited to detect tortuous, small vessels or capillary abnormalities. Theoretically, vessel tortuosity would lead to greater vessel complexity, which may have implications in the ischemic state of the retina.

### The geometry of masking in neural populations [^4a15dd53]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Masking shrinks and rotates population responses

To verify our perception that curves are shrinking we computed their lengths,… The arguments represent the angular velocity at which the population changes its orientation and represent a measure of discriminability between nearby angles. The length, therefore, represents local discriminability summed over all orientations. The mask had the effect of reducing the overall length of the curves by a factor of 0.84 ± 0.05 (mean ± 1 SD) (Fig. 5a). As we will soon demonstrate, this shrinkage is not uniform, but peaks near the orientation of the mask.

Fig. 5
Basic geometric properties of population representations in unmasked and masked conditions. a Shrinkage of the length of the curves by the introduction of the mask. Scatterplot shows the lengths of the curves in unmasked (L u) and masked (L m) conditions. Dashed line represents the unity line. Inset shows the distribution of L m / L u across all experiments. b Distribution of white-point shift across all experiments. c Measurements of the angle betweenand the planeacross all experiments. Solid line represents the mean, while the shaded area represents ± 2 SEM

To verify our impression that the mask induces a change in the direction of the mean population activity, we defined the white-point shift as. Here, represents the average radius of the curve in the unmasked condition, calculated as, and a corresponding definition applies to. In other words, we measure the shift of the white point in terms of the average radius of the curves. Across the population we find(mean ± 1 SD) — a relatively large fraction (Fig. 5b), which is consistent with the visualizations from multidimensional scaling. We will see this shift is important because it is partly responsible for generating biases in the estimation of orientation in the masked condition

Rejection of the linear combination model

With the geometric formalism in place, we can test a common model of population responses, which postulates that the response to a plaid can be written as a linear mixture of the population responses to the individual components. The implication for our experiment is that(recall the mask has orientation). One way to test the prediction is to measure the angle formed by the vectorand the plane. The results show a significant departure from the prediction, with angular deviations larger than 30° and significantly higher than zero (bootstrap estimate, see Methods) (Fig. 5c). Thus, the data rule out the linear combination model, a finding that confirms and extends a prior result.

The detection limit for qualitative tests is best described as the "LOD50", or number of organisms per gram of sample at which 50% of the tests are positive. "LOD50" not used. in the analytical chemistry sense of LOD and LOQ. It is used in the microbiological sense of an endpoint where the methods are able to estimate around the level of a few particles per analytical portion.

Fifty percent endpoint calculation methods allow for failures to inoculate resulting from imperfect homogeneity at low particle numbers per analytical portion.

Such calculations do not assume or require paired samples. LOD50 is determined with a nonparametric. version of probit analysis, and an experimental study using at least 4 dilutions in which at least two of the dilutions have "fractional positives" in order to estimate better the LOD50.

Atrioventricular annular area calculations and E/A ratio — For mitral valve (MV) size, MV area is calculated from apical 4-chamber/parasternal long-axis views using "1/2 × MVDL × MVDAP", with weaknesses noted as "Assumes elliptical shape" and "Measures annular area and not valvar area". For tricuspid valve (TV) size, TV area uses "1/2 × TVDL × TVDAP" from the same views with the same weaknesses. The E/A ratio from an apical 4-chamber view is defined as "E wave peak velocity/ A wave peak velocity" to assess LV diastolic function, with the limitation "Fast heart rates in children → fusion of E and A waves".

Fibre type distribution, fibre area, fibre perimeter, CAF and CAFA for type I and type IIa fibres.

Data are presented as mean ± SD.

* Significant difference compared to healthy subjects.

n = number of test subjects; CAF = number of capillaries around a single fibre; CAFA = the ratio between CAF and the area of the muscle fibre; ns = not significant

In a previous study we have reported the number of capillaries around a single muscle fibre (CAF) and the ratio between CAF and the fibre area (CAFA) (table 2). The capillary parameters measured in transverse sections of the muscle biopsies in the present study were:

1) The capillary-to-fibre ratio (C:F i), which was calculated by determining the number of capillaries around for the fibre in question followed by determination of the sharing factor (SF) for each capillary and thereafter taking the sum of the fractional contributions of all capillary contacts around the fibre.

2) The quotient between C:F i and the fibre perimeter, i.e. the CFPE-index

3) The ratio between length of capillary and fibre perimeter (LC/PF) which represents the percent of muscle fibre perimeter in contact with capillary wall. LC/PF is also referred to as the index of tortuosity.

Statistic analysis

Statistics were performed using Statistix ® 8 (Analytic Software, Tallahassee).

All data are presented as mean ± standard deviation. For comparison between groups the Kruskal-Wallis one way ANOVA test was used. When significance was found the Kruskal-Wallis all pairwise comparison post-hoc test was applied. Relationships between variables were studied using Spearmans rank correlation test. p < 0.05 was considered to be significant.

Atrial septal defect shunt quantification by Doppler — Qp/Qs method uses TTE pulse wave Doppler of RV and LV outflow tracts, measuring VTI and outflow diameters to calculate areas and stroke volumes; Qp/Qs equals RV stroke volume divided by LV stroke volume and has been validated against oximetry in a small series of secundum ASD patients. Shunt flow can be estimated by pulsed Doppler quantification of the pulmonary (Qp) to systemic (Qs) blood flow ratio, typically performed by pulse wave Doppler using TTE interrogating the RV and LV outflow tracts; the method measures VTIs and maximal systolic diameters, assumes circular outflow regions for area calculation, estimates area as (πr2) times VTI for stroke volume, defines Qp/Qs as RV stroke volume/LV stroke volume, and has been validated and compared with oximetric methods in a small number of patients with secundum ASD.

### Laboratory considerations on the use of F-18 myocardial perfusion imaging radiotracers: an information statement from the American Society of Nuclear Cardiology [^8f900f5c]. Journal of Nuclear Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Radiation considerations — principles of radiation protection for F-18 positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracers in nuclear cardiology laboratories emphasize ALARA and the core strategies of time, distance, and shielding. The physical characteristics of F-18 PET radiotracers can lead to increased radiation exposure, and "laboratory staff must have a strong foundation in radiation safety principles to effectively minimize radiation exposure and maintain doses that are 'as low as reasonably achievable' (ALARA)", with "the time, distance, and shielding" serving as key strategies for exposure reduction. "Minimize radiation exposure time"; exposure to staff "is directly proportional to the time spent in close proximity to an injected patient", with best practices including "Inject patients while on the scanner bed for pharmacologic stress" and "Discharge patients immediately after study completion to reduce unnecessary radiation exposure within the department". "Maximize distance from radiation source"; "radiation exposure decreases proportionally to the square of the distance from the source", and "Doubling the distance from a radiation source reduces exposure by a factor of four", with strategies such as "Maximize distance from the patient who is the radiation source", "Position the scanner at the furthest practical distance from the control room and other staff-occupied areas", and "Locate the scanner adjacent to areas of low occupancy such as external walls, hallways, storage rooms, or basement areas to limit radiation exposure to staff and the public". "Utilize physical shielding to maintain ALARA exposure"; "Proper shielding significantly reduces exposure, with dose attenuation increasing exponentially with shielding thickness", and "Physical shielding should then be added to achieve specific exposure targets according to the principles of ALARA", with U.S. regulatory context that "10 Code of Federal Regulations 20 establishes dose limits for staff working in radiation-controlled areas of 50 mSv/year [1]".

### Three-dimensional measurement of aortic annulus dimensions using area or circumference for transcatheter aortic valve replacement valve sizing: does It make a difference? [^52a59c1e]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The use of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is increasing worldwide. We present our 6-year experience using three-dimensional (3D) transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) and investigate whether different sizing methods of the aortic annulus lead to different prosthesis size that may impact outcome.

Methods

We investigated 262 patients who underwent TAVR and had 3D TEE data sets of the aortic annulus. We have used the area-derived diameter (D area = 2(area/π)) and the circumference-derived diameter (D circ = Circumference/π) to size the prosthesis in separate populations in different time periods.

Results

The D circ method is correlated with lower incidence of paravalvular aortic regurgitation (PVAR; odds ratio = 0.44, 95% confidence interval, 0.23–0.85; P = 0.015). Other factors associated with PVAR were the cover index, area-mismatch index, and circumference-mismatch index. Retrospectively, for the purposes of the study, we used the Edwards-Sapien 3 Valve 3D sizing guide in all patients, to predict the hypothetical valve size with each method. In the whole population, the calculated D circ was higher in all cases (D circ = 23.4 ± 2.3 mm vs D area = 22.9 ± 2.3 mm; P < .001). The two methods had good agreement in predicting the valve size (kappa = 0.600). In total, 192 (73.3%) patients were assigned for the same prosthesis size, whereas 70 (26.7%) would be eligible for a different size, of which 44 (16.7%) would definitely have had a different valve implanted.

Conclusion

Using the aortic annulus area or circumference to calculate the annular diameter provides different values. Comparing the two methods, a different prosthesis size could have been implanted in 26.7% of patients. In our series the use of circumference-derived diameter resulted in lower incidence of PVAR. The findings of this study may be independent of the imaging modality and may therefore also apply to computed tomography-based aortic annulus measurements, but this needs to be further investigated.

Interventricular septal shape and eccentricity index — use and thresholds note that the interventricular septal shape/ventricular configuration is another marker of RV size. Visual assessment of the diastolic and systolic ventricular septal curvature, looking for a D-shaped pattern, should be used to help in the diagnosis of RV volume and/or pressure overload, although a D-shaped ventricle formed by flattening of the septum is not diagnostic in RV overload. The severity of septal flattening has been quantified with an eccentricity index from the parasternal short-axis view, and a ratio greater than 1 is associated with RV volume overload.

### Paravalvular leak after transcatheter aortic valve implantation: is it anatomically predictable or procedurally determined? MDCT study [^86df51e3]. Clinical Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

Aim

To investigate the determinants of paravalvular leak (PVL) occurring after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI).

Materials and Methods

One hundred and eight patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis (mean age 75.5 ± 11.8 years, 72.2% male) underwent contrast-enhanced electrocardiogram (ECG)-gated multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) then successful TAVI. The following parameters were determined in the late systolic phase: annular and left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) diameters, annular perimeter, ellipticity index, annular area, indexed annular area, LVOT perimeter, annulus/LVOT perimeter difference ratio, the LVOT to ascending aorta angle (< LVOT-AO). In the diastolic phase, the extent of calcification of the aortic valve (AVC) was assessed visually and graded semi-quantitatively as grade I, II, and III at the annulus, LVOT, and aortic cusps levels. Pre-discharge transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) was performed, and the PVL was graded as grade I, II, and III. The area-dependent device-annulus sizing ratio was calculated.

Results

Absence of PVL was observed in 44.44% of the patients, 30.56% had grade I PVL, 25% of the patients had grade II or above, and any PVL was observed in 55.56%. There was no statistically significant association between the degree of PVL and the extent or the distribution of AVC, aortic annulus diameters, ellipticity index, annulus/LVOT perimeter difference ratio or < LVOT-AO. The frequency of PVL was not significantly different with the use of balloon-expandable or self-expandable valves. A larger transcatheter heart valve (THV)/annulus sizing ratio was associated with a lower incidence and degree of PVL (p < 0.001); there was no detectable PVL with a mean sizing ratio of 14.89 ± 7.29, and grade I PVL occurred with a mean sizing ratio 12.43 ± 0.84, while PVL of grade II or above occurred using the mean sizing ratio -0.42 ± 5.57.

Conclusion

The procedure-related THV/annulus sizing ratio was an important determinant of the degree of PVL after TAVI, whereas the MDCT-derived anatomical measurements of the aortic root and AVC were not predictors of PVL.

### The prediction of small airway dimensions using computed tomography [^6ce20b59]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is characterized by destruction of the lung parenchyma and/or small airway narrowing. To determine whether the dimensions of relatively large airways assessed using computed tomography (CT) reflect small airway dimensions measured histologically, we assessed these variables in nonobstructed or mild to moderately obstructed patients having lobar resection for a peripheral tumor. For both CT and histology, the square root of the airway wall area (Aaw) was plotted versus lumen perimeter to estimate wall thickness. The wall area percentage was calculated as wall area/lumen area + wall area x 100. Although CT overestimated Aaw, the slopes of the relationships between the square root of Aaw and internal perimeter (Pi) measured with both techniques were related (CT slope = 0.2059 histology slope + 0.1701, R2 = 0.32, p < 0.01). The mean wall area percentage measured by CT for airways with a Pi of greater than 0.75 cm predicted the mean dimensions of the small airways with an internal diameter of 1.27 mm (R2 = 0.57, p < 0.01). We conclude that CT measurements of airways with a Pi of 0.75 cm or more could be used to estimate the dimensions of the small conducting airways, which are the site of airway obstruction in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

### 3D height-alternant island arrays for stretchable OLEDs with high active area ratio and maximum strain [^69c985b4]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Stretchable optoelectronic devices are typically realized through a 2D integration of rigid components and elastic interconnectors to maintain device performance under stretching deformation. However, such configurations inevitably sacrifice the area ratio of active components to enhance the maximum interconnector strain. We herein propose a 3D buckled height-alternant architecture for stretchable OLEDs that enables the high active-area ratio and the enhanced maximum strain simultaneously. Along with the optimal dual serpentine structure leading to a low critical buckling strain, a pop-up assisting adhesion blocking layer is proposed based on an array of micro concave structures for spatially selective adhesion control, enabling a reliable transition to a 3D buckled state with OLED-compatible processes. Consequently, we demonstrate stretchable OLEDs with both the high initial active-area ratio of 85% and the system strain of up to 40%, which would require a lateral interconnector strain of up to 512% if it were attained with conventional 2D rigid-island approaches. These OLEDs are shown to exhibit reliable performance under 2,000 biaxial cycles of 40% system strain. 7 × 7 passive-matrix OLED displays with the similar level of the initial active-area ratio and maximum system strain are also demonstrated.

### Non-radiographic severity measurement of pectus excavatum [^1ffed7c2]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

To avoid the radiation exposure of CT imaging and the expense of CT or MRI studies, we sought to develop a non-radiographic severity measurement of pectus excavatum based on 3D photogrammetric imaging.

Methods

Over 28 mo, ten consecutive patient volunteers with pectus excavatum underwent 3D stereophotogrammetric imaging. The surface width to surface depth ratio (Surface Lengths Pectus Index), the chest deformity's surface area to total chest surface area (Pectus Surface Area Ratio), and the chest deformity's volume to total chest volume (Pectus Volume Ratio) were calculated. Simple linear regression analysis compared the Surface Lengths Pectus Index, Pectus Surface Area Ratio, and Pectus Volume Ratio calculations each to the corresponding known CT pectus index.

Results

The correlation between CT pectus index versus Surface Lengths Pectus Index yielded an R-squared value of 0.7637 and a P value of 0.0013. A CT pectus index of 3.4 or greater (eight patients) corresponded to a Surface Lengths Pectus Index of 1.86 or greater (six patients). The CT pectus index versus Pectus Surface Area Ratio (R-squared = 0.4627, P = 0.0305) and the CT pectus index versus the Pectus Volume Ratio (R-squared = 0.3048, P = 0.0990) demonstrated less correlation.

Conclusion

Surface Lengths Pectus Index corresponds to the CT pectus index and may be adequate to determine severity of pectus excavatum in some patients.

### Prediction of cardiovascular outcomes with left atrial size: is volume superior to area or diameter? [^bfb684ef]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2006). Low credibility.

Objectives

We sought to compare left atrial (LA) volume to LA area and diameter for the prediction of adverse cardiovascular outcomes.

Background

The incremental value of LA volume compared with LA area or diameter as a cardiovascular risk marker has not been evaluated prospectively for patients with sinus rhythm or atrial fibrillation (AF).

Methods

Left atrial size was assessed with biplane LA volume, four-chamber LA area, and M-mode dimension for 423 patients (mean age 71 ± 8 years, 56% men) who were prospectively followed for development of first AF, congestive heart failure, stroke, transient ischemic attack, myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization, and cardiovascular death.

Results

Of the 317 subjects in sinus rhythm at baseline, 62 had 90 new events during a mean follow-up of 3.5 ± 2.3 years. All three LA size parameters were independently predictive of combined outcomes (all p < 0.0001). The overall performance for the prediction of cardiovascular events was greatest for LA volume (area under the receiver operator characteristic curve: indexed LA volume 0.71; LA area 0.64; LA diameter 0.59). A graded association between the degree of LA enlargement and risk of cardiovascular events was only evident for indexed LA volume. For subjects with AF, there was no association between LA size and cardiovascular events.

Conclusions

Left atrial volume is a more robust marker of cardiovascular events than LA area or diameter in subjects with sinus rhythm. The predictive utility of LA size for cardiovascular events in AF was poor, irrespective of the method of LA size quantitation.

### Use of cardiac computerized tomography to predict neo-left ventricular outflow tract obstruction before transcatheter mitral valve replacement [^11ed34f7]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Mitral Annulus Assessment Using a 3D Workstation

Native Valve

Accurately measuring annular size in a native mitral valve is crucial in valve sizing for TMVR planning. The prosthetic valve must provide an adequate seal to prevent further valve dysfunction. For example, paravalvular regurgitation may occur if the prosthesis is too small relative to the size of the mitral annulus. Providing these measurements can, however, be challenging. Unlike the aortic valve annulus, the mitral valve annulus is a nonplanar structure and has a saddle shape. 27 The anterior peak of this saddle is continuous with the aortic annulus, the posterior peak is the insertion of the posterior mitral valve leaflet, and the nadirs of the saddle are at the level of the medial and lateral fibrous trigones (Figure 1). Because the mitral annulus is nonplanar, accurate measurement for device sizing is challenging. Blanke et al have proposed that the anterior horn of the saddle‐shaped annulus be excluded for TMVR assessment, creating a "D‐shaped" annulus suitable for planar measurements, with the anterior border a virtual line connecting the fibrous trigones. 25, 28 One disadvantage of using the D‐shape annulus approach, however, is that it does not always correspond with the shape of the device, which can be circular, depending on the degree of capture at the level of the trigones. Importantly, the entire geometric shape of the device needs to be taken into account in assessing for neo‐LVOT obstruction.

Figure 1
Performing mitral annular measurements and defining the annular plane on cardiac computerized tomography. A, Short‐axis view of the mitral annular region demonstrates the medial (black arrow) and lateral (white arrow) fibrous trigones, the anterior mitral valve leaflet (arrowhead), with delineation of the annular perimeter (red oval). The green and red lines in (B) demonstrate the orientation of the commissural view in (C) and long‐axis view in (D), with delineation of the mitral annular plane.

The annular plane can be defined by using a combination of short and long axis reformats of the left ventricle, which can identify the insertion points of the mitral valve leaflets (Figure 1). Once the annular plane has been defined, the maximum and minimum annular diameters, annulus area, and perimeter can be measured (Figure 2). By performing these measurements at the maximal annular size, information on prosthesis sizing can be provided, reducing the risk of significant post device implantation paravalvular regurgitation.

### Comparison of diameter and perimeter methods for tumor volume calculation [^ad9e63fb]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2001). Low credibility.

Purpose

Lesion volume is often used as an end point in clinical trials of oncology therapy. We sought to compare the common method of using orthogonal diameters to estimate lesion volume (the diameter method) with a computer-assisted planimetric technique (the perimeter method).

Methods

Radiologists reviewed 825 magnetic resonance imaging studies from 219 patients with glioblastoma multiforme. Each study had lesion volume independently estimated via the diameter and perimeter methods. Cystic areas were subtracted out or excluded from the outlined lesion. Inter- and intrareader variability was measured by using multiple readings on 48 cases. Where serial studies were available in noncystic cases, a mock response analysis was used.

Results

The perimeter method had a reduced interreader and intrareader variability compared with the diameter method (using SD of differences): intrareader, 1.76 mL v 7.38 mL (P < .001); interreader, 2.51 mL v 9.07 mL (P < .001) for perimeter and diameter results, respectively. Of the 121 noncystic cases, 23 had serial data. In six (26.1%) of those 23, a classification difference occurred when the perimeter method was used versus the diameter method.

Conclusion

Variability of measurements was reduced with the computer-assisted perimeter method compared with the diameter method, which suggests that changes in volume can be detected more accurately with the perimeter method. The differences between these techniques seem large enough to have an impact on grading the response to therapy.

### Digital morphometry of tumor nuclei correlates to BAP-1 status, monosomy 3, gene expression class and survival in uveal melanoma [^e5577f59]. Experimental Eye Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Cytologic features such as the shape and size of tumor cells can predict metastatic death in uveal melanoma and other cancers but suffer from poor reproducibility. In this study, we investigate the interobserver concordance of digital morphometry, and correlate the results with BRCA associated protein-1 (BAP-1) expression and BAP-1 gene mutation status, monosomy 3, gene expression classifications and patient survival in uveal melanoma. The average number of cells analyzed in each of 107 tumors, was 1957 (SD 349). Mean time consumption was less than 2.5 min per tumor. Identical morphometric classification was obtained for ≥ 85% of tumors in all twelve evaluated morphometric variables (κ 0.70–0.93). The mean nucleus area, nucleus perimeter, nucleus max caliper and nucleus to cell area ratio were significantly greater in tumors with low BAP-1 expression and gene expression class 2. Patients had significantly shorter survival if their tumors had low BAP-1 (Log-Rank p = 0.002), gene expression class 2 (p = 0.004), long nucleus perimeters (p = 0.031), long nucleus max calipers (p = 0.029) and high mean nucleus to cell area ratios (p = 0.041) as defined in a training cohort and then tested in a validation cohort. Long nucleus perimeters and long nucleus max calipers correlated with monosomy 3 (Pearson Chi-Square p = 0.006 and p = 0.009, respectively). Long nucleus perimeters also correlated with BAP-1 mutation (p = 0.017). We conclude that digital morphometry can be fast and highly reproducible, that for the first time, morphometry parameters can be objectively quantitated in thousands of cells at a time in sub-μm resolutions, and that variables describing the shape and size tumor nuclei correlate to BAP-1 status, monosomy 3, gene expression class as well as patient survival.

### Sonographic assessment of swallowing in irradiated nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients [^4657cdd6]. The Laryngoscope (2018). Low credibility.

Pharyngeal constriction ratio

Pharyngeal constriction ratio (PCR) is the ratio of pharyngeal area (in square centimeters) at maximum constriction of a swallow divided by that at the preswallow hold position. The PCR has been shown to correlate inversely with manometric measurements of pharyngeal pressure during swallowing. 18, 19 A higher percentage indicates a weaker pharyngeal constriction. The procedures described and anatomical definition given by Kendall et al. were adopted to select reference frames (i.e. preswallow hold position and maximum pharyngeal constriction) and outline the boundaries of the respective areas for the calculation of the PCR (Fig. 3). 20

Figure 3
Anatomical boundaries for tracing the pharyngeal area at (a) preswallow hold position, and (b) maximum constriction for the calculation of the pharyngeal constriction ratio during a thin liquid swallow. The ratio is 25% in this example.

Anterior and superior hyoid movement

To measure hyoid bone displacement (in centimeters), an x‐y coordinate system was produced on the videofluoroscopic image in such a way that the y‐axis passed through the most anteroinferior point of the cervical vertebrae C2 and C4, whereas the x‐axis intersected perpendicularly with the y‐axis and the origin located at the most anteroinferior point of C4 (Fig. 4). 21 The image was then rotated so that the y‐axis became vertical. Maximum anterior and superior hyoid displacement were selected independently (Fig. 4 a, b), whereas the rest frame was defined as the frame in which the hyoid bone returned to its lowest position after each swallow (Fig. 4 c).

Figure 4
Measurement of hyoid displacement on rotated images. An x‐y coordinate system was constructed with reference to C2 and C4. The hyoid position was measured at its (a) maximum superior displacement (Hy S), (b) maximum anterior displacement (Hy A), and (c) lowest position postswallow.

### Selective directed self-assembly of coexisting morphologies using block copolymer blends [^216275c6]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

Image analysis

We quantify order in the BCP patterns using image analysis of SEM data, as previously described in the literature. We used code written in the Python programming language, exploiting libraries for image manipulation (Python Image Library), numerical computations (numpy)and plotting (matplotlib). For dot patterns, image thresholding and segmentation is used to identify the cylinder cores. The local topology of the hexagonal lattice is assessed by connecting cylinder cores to nearest neighbours, using a cutoff distance of 1.36 × the average cylinder–cylinder distance (that is, halfway between the first and second 'rings' of cylinders surrounding a representative cylinder). For each cylinder, the number of neighbours (number of cylinders within the cutoff distance) is calculated. Using this nearest-neighbour map, defects can be identified by cylinders that deviate from the ideal state of having six nearest neighbours (regions where a cylinder is 'missing' are surrounded by cylinders of five nearest neighbours, distortions of the hex lattice lead to local configurations where the nearest-neighbour count is larger or smaller than six, and so on). The areal defect density is computed by dividing the defect count by the image size (cylinders at the periphery of the image are ignored, since they lack the correct nearest-neighbour count owing to the image edge). For line patterns, image thresholding and segmentation is used to identify the endpoints of individual lines. Endpoints (other than at the image edge) correspond to local defects in the morphology. The trend of the areal defect densities provides a robust measure of the relative ordering quality of different samples. The relative areal coverage of line patterns (F L) versus dot patterns was assessed using particle counting. A thresholded image was used to identify 'particles' within the image, and a size cutoff was used to distinguish between regions of dots (small particles) and lines (large, elongated particles). The spacing between rows of aligned BCP morphology was assessed by summing pixel grayscale intensity values in each column in the SEM image. Images were first Fourier-filtered to suppress imaging noise, and rotated to align the experimental patterns with the pixel grid. Columns were summed to yield a one-dimensional oscillating curve. Peak-fitting (Gaussian fit constrained to a local part of the curve) was used to identify the positions of local maxima; distances between adjacent maxima were used to measure the local pattern spacing (Δ x).
