## Question

aspirin carotid endarterectomy

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about aspirin use around carotid endarterectomy, including indications, dosing, timing, dual antiplatelet therapy, special scenarios, and how to reconcile conflicting evidence and guidelines. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the strength of evidence for aspirin in CEA and the optimal dose. Then, I should verify guideline concordance across societies. Next, I will examine perioperative timing and whether to hold aspirin. After that, I need to evaluate the role and risks of dual antiplatelet therapy versus monotherapy. I will then consider special populations such as those with atrial fibrillation or recent thrombolysis. Finally, I should synthesize a practical, stepwise recommendation and highlight uncertainties that require individualized decisions.

> Let me first confirm the core evidence base for aspirin in CEA. The Aspirin and Carotid Endarterectomy trial randomized patients to 81 mg, 325 mg, 650 mg, or 1,300 mg aspirin and showed lower combined stroke, MI, and death at 3 months with low-dose aspirin (81–325 mg) versus higher doses (6.2% vs 8.4%, P = 0.03), supporting low-dose aspirin as the preferred regimen around CEA [^1114swow]. Wait, let me verify the dose-response claim more broadly; across randomized comparisons, there is no convincing evidence that higher aspirin doses outperform lower doses, and indirect analyses suggest diminishing returns and possibly blunted antithrombotic effects at higher doses, reinforcing the preference for 75–325 mg rather than higher dosing [^111x6MmZ]. I should also confirm that a Cochrane review of antiplatelet therapy after CEA found a significant reduction in stroke with antiplatelet therapy, aligning with the mechanistic rationale for perioperative platelet inhibition in this setting [^115XHfXN].

> Next, I should review guideline concordance to ensure consistency. The ESVS 2023 guideline recommends low-dose aspirin (75–325 mg daily) for recently symptomatic patients undergoing CEA and advises initiating low-dose aspirin in asymptomatic patients undergoing CEA, which aligns with the dose range supported by the ACE trial and contemporary practice [^113rC7xv] [^115idwLZ]. The ESC 2024 guideline recommends long-term single antiplatelet therapy after internal carotid artery revascularization, again consistent with aspirin monotherapy as standard post-CEA care [^1138ES6i]. Hold on, I should verify North American guidance; the ACCP 9th edition gives a Grade 1A recommendation for aspirin 75–100 mg daily preoperatively and continued indefinitely after CEA, which matches the low-dose strategy and indefinite duration approach [^notfound].

> I will now examine perioperative timing and whether aspirin should be held. The ACCP explicitly recommends aspirin be administered preoperatively and continued through the perioperative period, and the SVS similarly endorses continuation of aspirin before and after CEA, reflecting concern for early thrombotic complications if antiplatelet therapy is withdrawn [^111VDseK] [^1149L93L]. But wait, what if there is a bleeding concern? The POISE-2 trial in noncardiac surgery found increased bleeding with perioperative aspirin and notably excluded CEA, so its results cannot be directly extrapolated to CEA where the thrombotic risk without aspirin is nontrivial and guideline consensus supports continuation [^114B8Eer]. I should double-check that no major guideline advises holding aspirin for CEA in the absence of a compelling bleeding risk; indeed, none do, and the ESAIC bleeding guidance even notes not to initiate aspirin preoperatively except for CEA, underscoring the unique role of aspirin in this procedure [^112J7zNU].

> Now, I need to evaluate dual antiplatelet therapy versus monotherapy. The rationale for adding clopidogrel is stronger in recently symptomatic patients at high early recurrence risk and in those with vulnerable plaque physiology, but the bleeding trade-off is real in surgical fields. A randomized study showed that adding clopidogrel the night before CEA reduced postoperative emboli tenfold without a significant increase in bleeding or transfusions, suggesting biological plausibility for benefit, though clinical stroke outcomes were not powered in that study [^113ZtbmH]. Hmm, wait a minute, observational and meta-analytic data complicate this; large registries and a meta-analysis suggest no reduction in stroke/TIA/death with DAPT versus SAPT after CEA but a higher risk of major bleeding and neck hematoma, which can precipitate airway compromise and reoperation, so routine DAPT for CEA is not favored [^114cDnR4] [^116dv2j1]. I should confirm guideline positions; ESVS suggests considering aspirin 300–325 mg daily for 14 days followed by 75–162 mg daily when monotherapy is preferred in recently symptomatic patients, and otherwise supports low-dose aspirin monotherapy as standard, reflecting a cautious stance toward routine DAPT in CEA [^115ioUzF] [^113rC7xv].

> Let me consider special scenarios that modify antiplatelet decisions. In patients with atrial fibrillation or venous thromboembolism who require oral anticoagulation, expert consensus recommends stopping all antiplatelet therapy and using a DOAC alone once safe from hemorrhagic transformation or postoperative bleeding, typically 3–14 days after CEA, which avoids additive bleeding risk while maintaining thrombotic protection via anticoagulation [^117H8jBo] [^1123mXsM]. Hold on, I should verify the timing nuance; the pathway allows earlier initiation if bleeding risk is low and imaging excludes hemorrhage, but in most post-CEA patients, waiting several days is prudent to mitigate neck hematoma risk [^117H8jBo]. For patients recently treated with thrombolysis, I need to ensure a 24-hour antiplatelet hold to reduce intracranial hemorrhage risk before resuming aspirin, which is consistent with stroke protocols and peri-CEA safety considerations [^113zcNNA].

> I should confirm how symptom status and stenosis severity influence aspirin decisions. For symptomatic patients with 50–99% stenosis, aspirin is indicated perioperatively and long term as part of secondary stroke prevention, and the benefit of CEA is greatest when performed within 14 days of the index event, reinforcing the need to maintain antiplatelet therapy without interruption if feasible [^113rC7xv] [^114asK69]. For asymptomatic patients with 60–99% stenosis, aspirin is recommended perioperatively and long term primarily to reduce cardiovascular events rather than to prevent perioperative stroke per se, which aligns with the pathophysiology of plaque-driven myocardial risk in this population [^115idwLZ] [^115ACeou].

> Next, I should review practical perioperative details that interact with aspirin use. Intraoperative heparin is standard, and some centers reverse heparin with protamine to reduce hematoma risk; importantly, protamine reversal has not been shown to increase thromboembolic stroke and may reduce neck hematomas, which is relevant when managing patients on continued aspirin or when considering brief DAPT courses in selected cases [^113zcNNA]. I need to ensure blood pressure control is emphasized post-CEA, especially in recently symptomatic patients, because hypertension increases the risks of hyperperfusion syndrome, intracerebral hemorrhage, and wound hematoma, all of which can be compounded by antiplatelet therapy if not meticulously managed [^113zcNNA].

> Let me synthesize a stepwise recommendation while keeping the evidence caveats in mind. Standard practice is low-dose aspirin 75–325 mg daily continued through the perioperative period and indefinitely after CEA, with 81–162 mg being the most commonly used range in contemporary practice, based on the ACE trial and multiple guidelines [^1114swow] [^113rC7xv] [^111VDseK]. In recently symptomatic patients at very high early recurrence risk, a short course of higher-dose aspirin (for example, 300–325 mg daily for about 14 days) may be considered before transitioning back to low-dose maintenance, acknowledging limited direct outcome data and balancing bleeding risk [^115ioUzF]. Routine DAPT is not recommended for CEA due to increased bleeding and neck hematoma without clear ischemic benefit, though selected patients with very recent symptoms and high embolic risk may be considered for short perioperative DAPT in expert hands after careful risk–benefit discussion and with aggressive blood pressure control [^114cDnR4] [^116dv2j1] [^113ZtbmH]. If the patient requires chronic oral anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation or VTE, stop antiplatelet therapy and use DOAC monotherapy once postoperative bleeding risk permits, typically 3–14 days after surgery [^117H8jBo] [^1123mXsM].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions without acknowledging uncertainties and areas for individualized care. The optimal duration of any perioperative DAPT in CEA remains unsettled, with conflicting data and no definitive randomized trial establishing net clinical benefit, so decisions should weigh symptom recency, plaque vulnerability, surgical timing, and bleeding risk, ideally in multidisciplinary discussion [^114cDnR4] [^116dv2j1]. I should double-check that ongoing trials and contemporary registries continue to refine these questions; until then, adherence to low-dose aspirin monotherapy as the default and selective, time-limited escalation in high-risk symptomatic patients represents the most evidence-concordant approach [^113rC7xv] [^1138ES6i].

Aspirin is indicated for all patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy [^111VDseK] unless contraindicated, with **75–325 mg daily** [^116wHXk9] recommended by major guidelines [^115idwLZ] to reduce perioperative stroke and cardiovascular events [^1114swow]. Low-dose aspirin (75–162 mg) is preferred [^115ioUzF] because it provides antithrombotic benefit with a lower bleeding risk than higher doses [^notfound]. Aspirin should be started preoperatively and continued indefinitely postoperatively [^111VDseK]; if not already on aspirin, initiate 75–325 mg daily before surgery when feasible [^111wXwJ9]. Dual antiplatelet therapy is not routinely recommended for CEA [^115MtmdY] due to increased bleeding risk [^116dv2j1] and is reserved for specific cardiac indications or when clopidogrel is already indicated [^notfound].

## Indications for aspirin therapy in CEA

Aspirin is indicated for **both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients** undergoing CEA [^111wXwJ9]:

- **Symptomatic patients**: Aspirin 75–325 mg daily is recommended for recently symptomatic patients (TIA or minor ischemic stroke) undergoing CEA [^113rC7xv].

- **Asymptomatic patients**: Aspirin 75–325 mg daily is recommended for asymptomatic patients undergoing CEA [^115idwLZ].

- **Alternative antiplatelet therapy**: Modified-release dipyridamole monotherapy is recommended for patients intolerant to or allergic to aspirin and clopidogrel [^117EotRu].

---

## Recommended aspirin dosage and timing

- **Dosage**: The recommended aspirin dosage for CEA is 75–325 mg daily [^116wHXk9] [^113rC7xv].

- **Timing**: Aspirin should be initiated preoperatively and continued indefinitely postoperatively [^111VDseK].

- **Low-dose preference**: Low-dose aspirin (75–162 mg daily) is preferred due to lower bleeding risk and comparable antithrombotic efficacy [^111x6MmZ].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting aspirin use in CEA

Multiple studies and guidelines support aspirin use in CEA:

- **Cochrane review**: Antiplatelet therapy, including aspirin, significantly reduces stroke risk after CEA (OR 0.58, 95% CI 0.34–0.98) [^115XHfXN].

- **ACCP guidelines**: Aspirin 75–100 mg daily is recommended preoperatively and continued indefinitely postoperatively [^111VDseK].

- **ESVS guidelines**: Aspirin 75–325 mg daily is recommended for both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients undergoing CEA [^113rC7xv] [^115idwLZ].

---

## Risks and benefits of aspirin therapy in CEA

### Benefits

Benefits include a **reduced risk of perioperative stroke** [^115XHfXN] and myocardial infarction [^115ACeou] and improved long-term cardiovascular outcomes [^111VDseK].

---

### Risks

Risks include an **increased risk of bleeding complications** [^114B8Eer], including neck hematoma [^114cDnR4] and gastrointestinal bleeding [^113ge6To], and a higher risk of bleeding with higher aspirin doses (> 325 mg daily) [^notfound].

## Comparison with other antiplatelet agents

| **Attribute** | **Aspirin** | **Clopidogrel** | **Dual antiplatelet therapy (dapt)** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Efficacy | Effective in reducing stroke and cardiovascular events [^1114swow] | Effective alternative to aspirin [^111LVpjv] | No clear superiority over aspirin alone in CEA [^114cDnR4] |
| Bleeding risk | Lower than DAPT [^114cDnR4] | Similar to aspirin [^114DKKkS] | Higher bleeding risk [^114cDnR4] |
| Guideline recommendation | Strongly recommended [^111VDseK] | Alternative to aspirin [^111LVpjv] | Not routinely recommended [^115ioUzF] |

---

## Special considerations and contraindications

- **Allergy or intolerance**: Modified-release dipyridamole is recommended for patients allergic to or intolerant of aspirin and clopidogrel [^117EotRu].

- **Bleeding risk**: Aspirin should be used cautiously in patients with high bleeding risk, and alternative antiplatelet strategies may be considered [^114B8Eer].

- **Perioperative management**: Aspirin should be continued perioperatively unless contraindicated [^111VDseK].

---

## Current guidelines and expert consensus

Current guidelines consistently recommend aspirin therapy for CEA:

- **ESVS 2023**: Aspirin 75–325 mg daily for symptomatic and asymptomatic patients undergoing CEA [^113rC7xv] [^115idwLZ].

- **ACCP 2012**: Aspirin 75–100 mg daily preoperatively and continued indefinitely postoperatively [^notfound].

- **ESC 2024**: Long-term single antiplatelet therapy (aspirin or clopidogrel) recommended after internal carotid artery revascularization [^1138ES6i].

---

Aspirin is the **standard antiplatelet therapy** for CEA [^113rC7xv], with a recommended dose of 75–325 mg daily [^116wHXk9]. It reduces perioperative stroke and cardiovascular events [^1114swow] with a favorable benefit–risk profile at low doses [^111x6MmZ]. Dual antiplatelet therapy is not routinely recommended due to increased bleeding risk [^114cDnR4] and should be reserved for specific indications [^114L4YH9].

### Aspirin in patients undergoing noncardiac surgery [^114B8Eer]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2014). Excellent credibility.

The study POISE-2 (aspirin) was published by Devereaux PJ and colleagues in 2014 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Perioperative cardiac risk management for noncardiac surgery, Periprocedural management of antithrombotic therapy and Perioperative bleeding. In the POISE-2 (aspirin) study, the trial question was: what is the role of aspirin in patients undergoing noncardiac surgery? In the POISE-2 (aspirin) study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the POISE-2 (aspirin) study, the population was: 10010 patients (4727 female, 5283 male). The inclusion criteria were patients undergoing noncardiac surgery who were at risk for vascular complications. The key exclusion criteria were hypersensitivity or known allergy to aspirin, consumption of aspirin within 72 hours prior to surgery, SBP < 105 m Hg, active peptic ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding within 6 weeks before surgery, undergoing intracranial surgery, carotid endarterectomy, or retinal surgery. In the POISE-2 (aspirin) study, the interventions were: n = 4998 aspirin (at a dose of 200 mg before surgery and continued daily at a dose of 100 mg for 30 days in the initiation stratum and for 7 days in the continuation stratum) n = 5012 placebo (matching dose). In the POISE-2 (aspirin) study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in death or nonfatal myocardial infarction at 30 days (7% vs. 7.1%; HR 0.99, 99% CI 0.86 to 1.15). In the POISE-2 (aspirin) study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in myocardial infarction (6.2% vs. 6.3%; HR 0.98, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.15). In the POISE-2 (aspirin) study, the safety outcomes were: significant differences in major bleeding (4.6% vs. 3.8%, p = 0.04; HR 1.23, 95% CI 1.01–1.49). In the POISE-2 (aspirin) study, the conclusion was: in patients undergoing noncardiac surgery who were at risk for vascular complications, aspirin was not superior to placebo with respect to death or nonfatal myocardial infarction at 30 days.

### Optimal antiplatelet therapy in moderate to severe asymptomatic and symptomatic carotid stenosis: a comprehensive review of the literature [^112XBheX]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Carotid stenosis patients are at risk of vascular events despite antiplatelet therapy. Data on prescribed antiplatelet regimens have not been comprehensively collated from trials to guide optimal therapy in this population.

Methods

This review was conducted in line with the current Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. Medline, Ovid, Embase, Web of Science, and Google Scholar from 1988 to 2018 were searched using the search terms "carotid stenosis", "asymptomatic", "symptomatic", "antiplatelet", and "anti-platelet" to identify randomised trials in patients with asymptomatic or symptomatic extracranial moderate-severe carotid stenosis on any form of antiplatelet therapy in which vascular events and pre specified composite outcome events were reported.

Results

Twenty-five studies were judged eligible for inclusion. Data from one randomised controlled trial showed no significant difference in benefit with aspirin versus placebo in asymptomatic carotid stenosis, but it is still reasonable to recommend aspirin (81–325 mg daily) for prevention of vascular events in these patients. Low to medium dose aspirin (81–325 mg daily) is superior to higher doses (> 650 mg daily) at preventing recurrent vascular events in patients undergoing endarterectomy. Data from endovascular treatment (EVT) trials support peri-procedural treatment of asymptomatic and symptomatic patients with 81–325 mg of aspirin daily. The use of peri-procedural aspirin-clopidogrel in patients undergoing EVT is based on one pilot trial, but appears safe. Short-term aspirin-dipyridamole or aspirin-clopidogrel treatments are equally effective at reducing micro-embolic signals on transcranial Doppler ultrasound in patients with ≥ 50% symptomatic carotid stenosis. There is insufficient evidence to recommend routine aspirin-clopidogrel combination therapy to reduce the risk of recurrent clinical ischaemic events in patients with symptomatic moderate-severe carotid stenosis.

Conclusions

This comprehensive review outlines an evidence based approach to antiplatelet therapy in carotid stenosis patients. Future trials should randomise such patients to receive different antiplatelet regimens to assess their efficacy and safety and to optimise peri-procedural and long-term preventive treatment in this patient cohort.

### Symptomatic carotid stenosis: endarterectomy, stenting, or best medical management? [^113oCQQJ]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

In the past, management of symptomatic carotid stenosis was uncertain. The results of the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial (NASCET) in 1991 demonstrated a significant advantage of Carotid Endarterectomy (CEA) compared to medical management with Aspirin (ASA). Since the publishing of the NASCET results, there have been advances in both the medical management of patients with peripheral arterial disease as well as the introduction and improvement of the technique of minimally invasive carotid angioplasty and stenting. With this progress, the question has to be raised about what is the most appropriate treatment option for patients with symptomatic carotid artery stenosis. A review of the prospective clinical trials regarding the medical, surgical and endovascular management will help to elucidate the optimal therapy for symptomatic carotid stenosis.

### Process of care for carotid endarterectomy: perioperative medical management [^113d7Haw]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) has been repeatedly described as a safe and efficacious procedure to provide a stroke-risk reduction benefit in both symptomatic and asymptomatic cases. Contemporary outcomes are acceptable using the large-scale randomized trials as a metric of success. Class I and II data can be applied to improve the care process of patients undergoing CEA. Myocardial infarction remains the most significant nonstroke complication; however, there is no significant benefit to noninvasive stress testing in patients with clinically stable disease. Perioperative beta-blockade may offer up to a 10-fold reduction in the rate of perioperative myocardial infarction, but deleterious effects are attributable to high-dose regimens. Angiotensin blockade has been shown to reduce cardiovascular mortality in patients with atherosclerosis by up to 25%, although few studies have examined these agents directly in carotid surgery patients. Statins are beneficial to patients undergoing CEA with trials demonstrating up to a 3% absolute reduction in the incidence of stroke following CEA. Aspirin therapy is associated with an up to 7% absolute reduction in early stroke following CEA; however, the efficacy of combination or high-dose antiplatelet therapy remains ill-defined. A treatment strategy that involves perioperative medical optimization is likely to improve surgical outcomes and long-term cardiovascular risk for patients undergoing CEA.

### Antiplatelet therapy for preventing stroke and other vascular events after carotid endarterectomy [^115XHfXN]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Antiplatelet drugs are effective and safe in a wide variety of patients at high risk of vascular ischaemic events. Among patients undergoing vascular surgical procedures, these agents significantly reduce the risk of graft or native vessel occlusion. In this context we wished to examine their effects in patients after carotid endarterectomy (CEA).

Objectives

The objective of this review was to evaluate whether antiplatelet agents are safe and beneficial after endarterectomy of the internal carotid artery.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (last searched: 1 October 2002). In addition we performed comprehensive searches of the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (Cochrane Library Issue 3, 2002), MEDLINE (January 1966 to September 2002) and EMBASE (January 1980 to September 2002), and checked all relevant papers for additional eligible studies.

Selection Criteria

We selected randomised, controlled, unconfounded trials comparing antiplatelet agents with control after carotid endarterectomy in symptomatic or asymptomatic carotid stenosis of different degrees. Treatment duration had to be at least 30 days after CEA. Follow-up should be at least three months.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers selected trials for inclusion, assessed trial quality, and extracted data independently from each other. From each trial we extracted, first the number of patients originally allocated to each treatment group, and, second the number of patients who met the criteria for each outcome (intention-to-treat analysis). We calculated a weighted estimate of the odds for each outcome event across studies using the Peto odds ratio method.

Main Results

Six trials involving 907 patients were identified. For 'death (all causes)' the Peto odds ratio of 0.77 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 0.48–1.24 did not show a statistically significant difference between both treatment groups. For 'stroke (any)' the Peto odds ratio of 0.58 (95%CI: 0.34–0.98) indicated a statistically significant benefit in favour of antiplatelet drugs (p = 0.04). Concerning the secondary outcome events 'vascular death', 'stroke or vascular death', 'serious vascular events', 'death or dependency', 'myocardial infarction', 'major extracranial haemorrhage', 'local haemorrhage requiring surgery', 'restenosis', 'TIA or amaurosis fugax', neither any benefit nor any hazard of antiplatelet drugs could be shown. For the outcome events 'intracranial haemorrhage', 'ischaemic stroke' and 'occurrence or progression of contralateral stenosis', data were either too sparse for meaningful analyses, or not available at all.

Reviewer's Conclusions

Our results may indicate that antiplatelet drugs did not significantly change the odds of 'death' but reduce the outcome 'stroke of any cause' in patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy. However, it can not be excluded that the beneficial effect in reducing stroke is due to chance. There is a suggestion that antiplatelets may increase the odds of haemorrhage, but there are currently too few data to quantify this effect.

### Antithrombotic therapy in peripheral artery disease: antithrombotic therapy and prevention of thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^1114swow]. Chest (2012). Medium credibility.

Carotid endarterectomy — antiplatelet therapy evidence: A Cochrane systematic review identified six RCTs comparing antiplatelet therapy to no antiplatelet therapy in patients with symptomatic or asymptomatic carotid stenosis undergoing carotid endarterectomy (with ≥ 3 months of follow-up). Four trials tested aspirin (dose range, 50–1,300 mg), one tested aspirin (990 mg) plus dipyridamole (225 mg), and one tested indobufen (400 mg). Timing of initiation ranged from 12 h prior to carotid endarterectomy to up to 3 months after, and treatment and follow-up ranged from 6 to 54 months. Antiplatelet drugs were associated with fewer strokes (OR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.34–0.98), with an estimated absolute effect of 34 fewer per 1,000 patients treated (2 fewer to 54 fewer). In the Aspirin and Carotid Endarterectomy trial, 2,849 patients were randomly assigned to aspirin 81, 325, 650, or 1,300 mg, started before surgery and continued for 3 months; low-dose groups (81 and 325 mg) had lower combined stroke, MI, and death at 30 days (5.4% vs 7.0%, P = .07) and 3 months (6.2% vs 8.4%, P = .03). No RCTs measured important outcomes comparing clopidogrel vs aspirin or clopidogrel plus aspirin vs single antiplatelet therapy in this setting.

### Optimal periprocedural antithrombotic treatment in carotid interventions: an international, multispecialty, expert review and position statement [^1168HUi1]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The optimal antithrombotic (antiplatelet or anticoagulant) treatment of patients undergoing extracranial carotid artery interventions is a subject of debate. The aim of this multidisciplinary document was to critically review the recommendations of current guidelines, taking into consideration the results of recently published studies.

Methods

The various antithrombotic strategies reported were evaluated for asymptomatic and symptomatic patients undergoing extracranial carotid artery interventions (endarterectomy, transfemoral carotid artery stenting [CAS] or transcarotid artery revascularization [TCAR]). Based on a critical review, a series of recommendations were formulated by an international expert panel.

Results

For asymptomatic patients, we recommend low-dose aspirin (75–100 mg/day) or clopidogrel (75 mg/day) with the primary goal to reduce the risk of myocardial infarction and cardiovascular event rates rather than to reduce the risk of stroke. For symptomatic patients, we recommend dual antiplatelet treatment (DAPT) initiated within 24 h of the index event to reduce the risk of recurrent events. We suggest that following transfemoral CAS or TCAR, patients continue DAPT for 1 month after which a single antiplatelet agent is used. High level of evidence to support anticoagulant treatment for patients with carotid artery disease is lacking.

Conclusions

The antithrombotic treatment offered to carotid patients should be individualized, taking into account the presence of symptoms, the type of intervention and the goal of the treatment. The duration and type of DAPT (ticagrelor instead of clopidogrel) should be evaluated in future trials.

### Stroke prevention [^114PQ6G4]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2008). Medium credibility.

Introduction

People with a history of stroke or transient ischaemic attack are at high risk of all vascular events, such as myocardial infarction (MI), but are at particular risk of subsequent stroke (about 10% in the first year and about 5% each year thereafter).

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of preventive interventions in people with previous stroke or transient ischaemic attack? What are the effects of preventive anticoagulant and antiplatelet treatments in people with atrial fibrillation and either with or without previous stroke or transient ischaemic attack? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to September 2006 (BMJ Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 120 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: alternative antiplatelet regimens to aspirin, anticoagulation (oral dosing, or in those with sinus rhythm), aspirin (high-dose, or low-dose aspirin), blood pressure reduction, carotid and vertebral percutaneous transluminal angioplasty, carotid endarterectomy (in people: with asymptomatic but severe carotid artery stenosis; with less than 30% symptomatic carotid artery stenosis; with moderate [30–49%] symptomatic carotid artery stenosis; with moderately severe [50–69%] symptomatic carotid artery stenosis; with severe [more than 70%] symptomatic carotid artery stenosis; or with symptomatic near occlusion of the carotid artery), cholesterol reduction, vitamin B suppliments (including folate), or different blood pressure-lowering regimens.

### Different perioperative antiplatelet therapies for patients treated with carotid endarterectomy in routine practice [^116dv2j1]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

There is currently no clear consensus regarding the optimal perioperative antiplatelet therapy regimen for carotid surgery. Therefore, associations between different antiplatelet therapies and the risk of stroke or death and perioperative complications after carotid endarterectomy on a national level in Germany were analyzed.

Methods

Overall, 117,973 elective carotid endarterectomies for asymptomatic or symptomatic carotid artery stenosis between 2010 and 2014 were included. Data were extracted from the statutory nationwide quality assurance database. The primary outcome was any in-hospital stroke or death until discharge from the hospital. Secondary outcomes were any major stroke or death, death alone, stroke, myocardial infarction, local bleeding, and any local complications (cranial nerve palsy, severe bleeding, acute occlusion). Descriptive statistics and multilevel multivariable regression analyses were applied. Single-agent therapy with aspirin was used as reference.

Results

Patients were predominantly male (68%), with a mean age of 71 years. Carotid stenosis was symptomatic in 40%. Of all patients, 82.8% were treated perioperatively by monotherapy with aspirin alone, 2.7% received other platelet inhibitors, and 4.8% of the patients were operated on under dual antiplatelet therapy. The primary outcome occurred in 1.8% of all patients. Multilevel multivariable regression analysis revealed that the combined stroke and death rate of patients with no perioperative antiplatelet therapy was significantly higher (risk ratio [RR], 1.21; 95% confidence interval, 1.04–1.42) compared with the group of patients receiving monotherapy. The same was true for the major stroke and death rate (RR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.02–1.48). In contrast, dual antiplatelet therapy was associated with a lower risk of death alone (RR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.51–0.88) but with a significantly higher rate of secondary bleeding requiring reoperation (RR, 2.16; 95% CI, 1.88–2.50).

Conclusions

This study shows that the risk of stroke or death was significantly higher in patients without any perioperative antiplatelet therapy. In contrast, dual antiplatelet therapy vs aspirin monotherapy was associated with a lower risk only of perioperative death but with a higher risk of neck bleeding until discharge. Perioperative antiplatelet therapy was significantly associated with a decreased in-hospital stroke and death risk. Further studies are needed to evaluate the risk-benefit ratio of single vs dual antiplatelet therapy.

### Medical treatment strategies to reduce perioperative morbidity and mortality after carotid surgery [^113zcNNA]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

There is a paucity of high-quality evidence regarding what constitutes "optimal medical therapy" for the purposes of reducing morbidity/mortality after carotid endarterectomy (CEA). All patients should be prescribed antiplatelet therapy. Low-dose aspirin (75 to 325 mg) should be continued throughout the perioperative period and there is no evidence that higher doses confer additional benefit. There is emerging evidence that early implementation of dual antiplatelet therapy in recently symptomatic patients (aspirin 75 mg plus clopidogrel 75 mg) can reduce recurrent cerebral events before CEA and that dual antiplatelet therapy will significantly reduce stroke due to early postoperative carotid thrombosis. Evidence suggests that dual antiplatelet therapy is not associated with a significant increase in bleeding complications, although it is essential to aggressively treat post-CEA hypertension. Antiplatelet therapy should be withheld for 24 hours after completion of thrombolysis. Statins should be started preoperatively; the rationale being that they will reduce perioperative myocardial infarction and stroke (especially in symptomatic patients), as well as reduce recurrent cerebral events before CEA. Heparin reversal using protamine is becoming increasingly common and there is no evidence that this significantly increases perioperative thromboembolic stroke, but it does seem to reduce the prevalence of neck hematomas, which can be associated with an increased risk of stroke/death after re-exploration. Post-CEA hypertension is especially common in recently symptomatic patients undergoing surgery within the first 7 to 14 days after onset of symptoms. Untreated, it is associated with high rates of intracerebral hemorrhage, stroke due to the hyperperfusion syndrome, and major cardiac events. Each unit should have written guidance for treating this condition promptly. This is especially important when CEA is performed in the first few days after onset of symptoms and, especially, when CEA is performed soon after thrombolysis.

### The use of clopidogrel in carotid endarterectomy: an audit of current practice [^112G64EA]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Clopidogrel is commonly encountered in patients presenting for carotid endarterectomy (CEA). Its use around this time is controversial and there is no randomized control trial data to determine best practice. Questionnaires were posted to all members of the Vascular Society investigating clopidogrel use at the time of CEA. 52% discontinue clopidogrel preoperatively, with 51% of those using no alternative and 49% replacing it with aspirin. Clopidogrel use is not related to the number of endarterectomies performed by each surgeon. There is no consensus on clopidogrel use during CEA. This highlights the need for quality prospective data on this subject.

### An assessment of guidelines for prevention of ischemic stroke [^114MfPmu]. Neurology (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare methods and key management recommendations from recent stroke prevention guidelines.

Methods

Systematic review of guidelines for prevention of ischemic stroke published in English between 1996 and 2001 was conducted, and recommendations were independently abstracted and compared.

Results

Among 22 stroke prevention guidelines, information was provided about panel selection in 24%, funding source in 36%, consensus methods in 33%, and quantitative risk/benefit estimates in 38%. Eleven recommended anticoagulation for patients with atrial fibrillation at high risk for stroke, but eight different sets of criteria to identify high-risk patients were proposed. Recommendations regarding carotid endarterectomy for asymptomatic stenosis varied from general endorsement in a setting of low perioperative risk to routinely withholding surgery. All nine relevant guidelines endorsed aspirin in dosages between 50 and 325 mg/day for initial antiplatelet therapy following cerebral ischemia; six also suggested other antiplatelet agents as options for initial therapy.

Conclusions

Current stroke prevention guidelines do not provide adequate methodologic information to permit assessment of their quality, potential bias, and clinical applicability. Management recommendations are relatively consistent but differ in several important areas.

### Antiplatelet therapy in carotid artery stenting and carotid endarterectomy in the asymptomatic carotid surgery trial-2 [^111LYvhU]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

Strokes are infrequent but potentially serious complications following carotid intervention, but antiplatelet therapy can reduce these risks. There are currently no specific guidelines on dose or duration of peri-procedural antiplatelet treatment for patients undergoing carotid intervention. Within the ongoing Asymptomatic Carotid Surgery Trial-2 (ACST-2), this study aimed at assessing the current use of antiplatelet therapy before, during, and after CEA and CAS in patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis.

Methods

Questionnaires were sent to ACST-2 collaborators seeking information about the use of antiplatelet therapy during the pre-, peri-, and post-operative periods in patients undergoing carotid intervention at 77 participating sites and also whether sites tested for antiplatelet therapy resistance.

Results

The response rate was 68/77 (88%). For CAS, 82% of sites used dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) pre-operatively and 86% post-operatively with a mean post-procedural duration of 3 months (range 1–12), while 9% continued DAPT life-long. For CEA only 31% used DAPT pre-operatively, 24% post-operatively with a mean post-procedural duration of 3 months (range 1–5), while 10% continued DAPT life-long. For those prescribing post-procedural mono antiplatelet (MAPT) therapy (76%), aspirin was more commonly prescribed (59%) than clopidogrel (6%) and 11% of centres did not show a preference for either aspirin or clopidogrel. Eleven centres (16%) tested for antiplatelet therapy resistance.

Conclusion

There appears to be broad agreement on the use of antiplatelet therapy in ACST-2 patients undergoing carotid artery stenting and surgery. Although evidence to help guide the duration of peri-procedural antiplatelet therapy is limited, long-term treatment with DAPT appears similar between both treatment arms.

### Variations in the pharmacological management of patients treated with carotid endarterectomy: a survey of European vascular surgeons [^113Scyao]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Objectives

The peri-operative use of antiplatelet, anticoagulant and other drugs for patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy (CEA) is unclear and consensus is lacking. This study aimed to assess the current peri-operative practice of European vascular surgeons with respect to antiplatelet and other medications for patients undergoing CEA.

Design

Online questionnaire study.

Methods

Members of the Vascular Society of Great Britain & Ireland and European Society for Vascular Surgery were invited to complete an online survey in March 2008. Surgeons were asked about their preferences for the peri-operative administration of antiplatelet, statin and other medications for patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy.

Results

Partial or complete responses were received from 399/650 (61.4%) surgeons with a collective annual throughput of > 11500 CEA procedures. For symptomatic and asymptomatic patients, 20/392 (5%) and 47/392 (12%) of surgeons would stop aspirin before surgery and 170/392 (43%) and 217/392 (55%) of surgeons would stop Clopidogrel prior to CEA. Of surgeons who would stop Clopidogrel, 84/170 (49%) and 124/217 (57%) would do so > 7 days before surgery for symptomatic and asymptomatic patients respectively. 12/393 (3%) surgeons would prescribe one 75 mg dose of Clopidogrel on the evening before surgery. Intra-operative Dextran was used selectively by 40/395 (10%). Only 78/393 (20%) would delay surgery to commence a statin. Intra-operatively, 348/394 (88%) used intravenous heparin, which was reversed routinely by 47/348 (13%) and selectively by 60/348 (17%).

Conclusions

There appears to be broad consensus between vascular surgeons in the pharmacological management of patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy, although some variations do exist. Further clinical studies may help clarify the optimum management strategy in this patient group.

### Antiplatelet drugs: antithrombotic therapy and prevention of thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^111x6MmZ]. Chest (2012). Medium credibility.

Aspirin — dose range and comparative efficacy across trials indicate effectiveness over a wide range without superior benefit from higher doses: the aspirin doses have ranged from 50 to 1,500 mg/d, and aspirin is an effective antithrombotic agent at doses between 50 and 1,500 mg/d, with it also possible that 30 mg/d is effective. In the ASA and Carotid Endarterectomy trial, the risk of stroke, myocardial infarction (MI), or death within 3 months was significantly lower for aspirin 81 or 325 mg/d vs 650 or 1,300 mg/d (6.2% vs 8.4%, P = .03). In CURRENT–OASIS 7, 30 days of aspirin 300 to 325 mg/d was no more effective than 75 to 100 mg/d for prevention of stroke, MI, or cardiovascular death (4.2% and 4.4%, respectively; HR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.86–1.09). Across randomized comparisons, there is no convincing evidence that higher doses are any more effective than lower doses, and indirect comparisons report blunting of the antithrombotic effect with higher doses. In high-risk patients, an indirect comparison found odds reduction (%) by dose: 500–1,500 mg/d 19 ± 3, 160–325 mg/d 26 ± 3, 75–150 mg/d 32 ± 6, and < 75 mg/d 13 ± 5.

### Updated Society for Vascular Surgery guidelines for management of extracranial carotid disease [^1149L93L]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2011). Medium credibility.

Perioperative antiplatelet therapy for CEA — Patients taking combined aspirin and clopidogrel therapy in the perioperative period have a 0.4% to 1.0% higher risk of major bleeding compared with aspirin alone. Aspirin therapy alone does not have to be discontinued before CEA, and the ACC Perioperative Guidelines endorse the continued use of aspirin before and after CEA. A low dose (81 to 325 mg) appears at least as effective as higher doses, and higher doses may in fact be less effective, and patients should continue aspirin therapy after CEA indefinitely, according to recommendations for high-risk patients with atherosclerosis. Regarding clopidogrel, there has been a consensus that preprocedural clopidogrel should be stopped approximately 5 days before elective CABG, but recent multicenter experience suggests that clopidogrel may be safely continued through the perioperative period without increased bleeding risk, so it is therefore reasonable to individualize the management of preoperative clopidogrel therapy; there is no clear information regarding the risks or benefits of continued clopidogrel monotherapy in the preprocedural period for CEA.

### Beneficial effects of clopidogrel combined with aspirin in reducing cerebral emboli in patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy [^113ZtbmH]. Circulation (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Postoperative thromboembolic stroke affects 2% to 3% of patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy (CEA) and is preceded by 1 to 2 hours of increasing cerebral embolization. Previous work has demonstrated that high rates of postoperative embolization are associated with increased platelet reactivity to adenosine 5'-diphosphate (ADP). Our hypothesis was that preoperative administration of the platelet ADP antagonist clopidogrel could reduce postoperative embolization.

Methods and Results

One hundred CEA patients on routine aspirin therapy (150 mg) were randomized to 75 mg clopidogrel (n = 46) or placebo (n = 54) the night before surgery. Platelet response to ADP was assessed by whole-blood flow cytometry. The number of emboli detected by transcranial Doppler within 3 hours of CEA was independently quantified. Time taken from flow restoration to skin closure was used as an indirect measure of the time to secure hemostasis. In comparison with placebo, clopidogrel produced a small (8.8%) but significant reduction in the platelet response to ADP (P < 0.05) while conferring a 10-fold reduction in the relative risk of those patients having > 20 emboli in the postoperative period (odds ratio, 10.23; 95% CI, 1.3 to 83.3; P = 0.01, Fisher's exact test). However, in the clopidogrel-treated patients, the time from flow restoration to skin closure (an indirect marker of hemostasis) was significantly increased (P = 0.04, Fisher's exact test), although there was no increase in bleeding complications or blood transfusions.

Conclusions

This is the first study to show that a CEA patient's postoperative thromboembolic potential can be significantly reduced by targeted preoperative antiplatelet therapy without increasing the risk of bleeding complications.

### ESVS guidelines. invasive treatment for carotid stenosis: indications, techniques [^111wXwJ9]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

The European Society for Vascular Surgery brought together a group of experts in the field of carotid artery disease to produce updated guidelines for the invasive treatment of carotid disease. The recommendations were rated according to the level of evidence. Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) is recommended in symptomatic patients with > 50% stenosis if the perioperative stroke/death rate is < 6% [A], preferably within 2 weeks of the patient's last symptoms [A]. CEA is also recommended in asymptomatic men < 75 years old with 70–99% stenosis if the perioperative stroke/death risk is < 3% [A]. The benefit from CEA in asymptomatic women is significantly less than in men [A]. CEA should therefore be considered only in younger, fit women [A]. Carotid patch angioplasty is preferable to primary closure [A]. Aspirin at a dose of 75–325 mg daily and statins should be given before, during and following CEA. [A] Carotid artery stenting (CAS) should be performed only in high-risk for CEA patients, in high-volume centres with documented low peri-operative stroke and death rates or inside a randomized controlled trial [C]. CAS should be performed under dual antiplatelet treatment with aspirin and clopidogrel [A]. Carotid protection devices are probably of benefit [C].

### 2020 ACC expert consensus decision pathway for anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy in patients with atrial fibrillation or venous thromboembolism undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention or with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^117H8jBo]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2021). High credibility.

Cerebrovascular disease with prior antiplatelet therapy (APT) and new atrial fibrillation — among patients appropriate for an oral anticoagulant (OAC) and currently receiving APT, the pathway separates three categories. For prior transient ischemic attack (TIA) or cerebrovascular accident, the pathway recommends stopping all APT and treating with an OAC alone (DOAC preferred) when considered safe from the perspective of hemorrhagic transformation, typically between 2 and 14 days following an acute event, and an OAC can typically be initiated immediately when TIA is the diagnosis without infarct or hemorrhage on imaging. For recent carotid endarterectomy, the pathway recommends stopping all APT and treating with an OAC alone (DOAC preferred) when considered safe from risk of post-operative bleeding, typically 3 to 14 days after surgery. For carotid stenting within the previous 1 to 3 months, our recommendation for most patients would be to stop aspirin, continue the P2Y12i (clopidogrel preferred), and start an OAC (DOAC preferred); if the standard duration of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) after carotid stenting has ended (usually 1 to 3 months), all APT may be stopped.

### Antithrombotic therapy for peripheral artery occlusive disease: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines (8th edition) [^111VDseK]. Chest (2008). Low credibility.

This chapter is devoted to antithrombotic therapy for peripheral artery occlusive disease as part of the American College of Chest Physicians Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines (8th Edition). Grade 1 recommendations are strong and indicate that the benefits do, or do not, outweigh risks, burden, and costs. Grade 2 suggests that individual patients' values may lead to different choices (for a full understanding of the grading see the "Grades of Recommendation" chapter by Guyatt et al, CHEST 2008; 133:123S-131S). Among the key recommendations in this chapter are the following: We recommend lifelong antiplatelet therapy in comparison to no antiplatelet therapy in pulmonary artery disease (PAD) patients with clinically manifest coronary or cerebrovascular disease (Grade 1A), and also in those without clinically manifest coronary or cerebrovascular disease (Grade 1B). In patients with PAD and intermittent claudication, we recommend against the use of anticoagulants (Grade 1A). For patients with moderate to severe disabling intermittent claudication who do not respond to exercise therapy, and who are not candidates for surgical or catheter-based intervention, we recommend cilostazol (Grade 1A). We suggest that clinicians not use cilostazol in those with less-disabling claudication (Grade 2A). In patients with short-term (< 14 days) arterial thrombosis or embolism, we suggest intraarterial thrombolytic therapy (Grade 2B), provided they are at low risk of myonecrosis and ischemic nerve damage developing during the time to achieve revascularization. For patients undergoing major vascular reconstructive procedures, we recommend IV unfractionated heparin (UFH) prior to the application of vascular cross clamps (Grade 1A). For all patients undergoing infrainguinal arterial reconstruction, we recommend aspirin (75–100 mg, begun preoperatively) [Grade 1A]. For routine autogenous vein infrainguinal bypass, we recommend aspirin (75–100 mg, begun preoperatively) [Grade 1A]. For routine prosthetic infrainguinal bypass, we recommend aspirin (75–100 mg, begun preoperatively) [Grade 1A]. In patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy, we recommend that aspirin, 75–100 mg, be administered preoperatively and continued indefinitely (75–100 mg/d) [Grade 1A]. In nonoperative patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis (primary or recurrent), we suggest that dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel be avoided (Grade 1B). For all patients undergoing lower-extremity balloon angioplasty (with or without stenting), we recommend long-term aspirin, 75–100 mg/d (Grade 1C).

### Impact of continued clopidogrel use on outcomes of patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy [^114DKKkS]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of clopidogrel at the time of carotid endarterectomy (CEA) and its association with postoperative complications.

Methods

Single-institution, retrospective review of a prospective database.

Results

From 2010 to 2017, CEA was performed in 1066 consecutive patients (median age, 73 years; 66% men). The indications for operation included ≥ 70% asymptomatic stenosis (458; 43%), prior stroke (314; 29%), and transient cerebral or retinal ischemia (294; 28%). At the time of operation, 509 (48%) patients were taking aspirin alone, 441 (41%) were taking clopidogrel (374 in combination with aspirin, 67 as sole therapy), 83 (8%) were on no documented antiplatelet medication, and 33 (3%) were taking warfarin (with therapeutic international normalized ratio). The likelihood of clopidogrel use at the time of operation was higher for patients with a history of symptomatic carotid disease (P = .002). Over the study period, clopidogrel use increased from 31.9% in 2010 to 56.8% in 2017, which corresponds to an 11% (95% confidence interval, 6%-15%) increase annually. Postoperative strokes occurred in 15 patients (overall incidence, 1.4%), the majority of which were minor (12/15; 80%). Six strokes occurred in patients taking aspirin alone (6/509; 1.2%), two in patients on clopidogrel and aspirin (2/441; 0.5%), two in patients taking clopidogrel alone (2/67; 2.9%), three in patients on no documented antiplatelet medication (3/83; 3.6%), and two in those taking warfarin (one of which was secondary to a fatal intracranial hemorrhage within 30 days of discharge [2/33; 6.1%]). The 30-day mortality rate was 0.03% (3/1066); the risk for the combined endpoint of any stroke, death, or myocardial infarction (MI) was 2.3% (25/1066), and the risk for major stroke, death, or MI was 1.2%. There was no apparent association between clopidogrel use and the incidence of postoperative bleeding (P = .59) or any other postoperative complication (stroke, death, MI, cranial nerve injury; p = 0.15).

Conclusions

Clopidogrel use in our CEA practice has increased over time and has not been associated with an increased risk of postoperative complications, including bleeding. These data suggest that clopidogrel should not be discontinued prior to CEA and should be considered as part of 'optimal medical therapy' in patients undergoing CEA.

### Aspirin and omeprazole (yosprala) [^113HFDgt]. FDA (2020). Medium credibility.

Aspirin Trials

Ischemic Stroke and Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA)

In clinical trials of subjects with TIA due to fibrin platelet emboli or ischemic stroke, aspirin has been shown to significantly reduce the risk of the combined endpoint of stroke or death and the combined endpoint of TIA, stroke, or death by about 13 to18%.

Prevention of Recurrent MI and Unstable Angina Pectoris

These indications are supported by the results of six large, randomized, multi-center, placebo-controlled trials of predominantly male post-MI subjects and one randomized placebo-controlled study of men with unstable angina pectoris. Aspirin therapy in MI subjects was associated with a significant reduction (about 20%) in the risk of the combined endpoint of subsequent death and/or nonfatal reinfarction in these patients. In aspirin-treated unstable angina patients the event rate was reduced to 5% from the 10% rate in the placebo group.

Chronic Stable Angina Pectoris

In a randomized, multi-center, double-blind trial designed to assess the role of aspirin for prevention of MI in patients with chronic stable angina pectoris, aspirin significantly reduced the primary combined endpoint of nonfatal MI, fatal MI, and sudden death by 34%. The secondary endpoint for vascular events (first occurrence of MI, stroke, or vascular death) was also significantly reduced (32%).

Revascularization Procedures

Most patients who undergo coronary artery revascularization procedures have already had symptomatic coronary artery disease for which aspirin is indicated. Similarly, patients with lesions of the carotid bifurcation sufficient to require carotid endarterectomy are likely to have had a precedent event. Aspirin is recommended for patients who undergo revascularization procedures if there is a preexisting condition for which aspirin is already indicated.

### Updated Society for Vascular Surgery guidelines for management of extracranial carotid disease [^113m4TVh]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2011). Medium credibility.

Neurologically asymptomatic carotid stenosis ≥ 60% — carotid endarterectomy (CEA) for asymptomatic lesions: Controlled randomized trials have compared CEA with best medical therapy and the results of ACAS and ACST favored CEA. ACAS demonstrated the superiority of CEA over antiplatelet therapy alone for asymptomatic patients with carotid stenosis of ≥ 60%, and this trial recommended CEA for these patients (aged < 80 years) as long as the expected combined stroke and mortality rate for the individual surgeon was not > 3%. In updated ACST I results, the patients in the CEA arm (aged < 75 years) experienced significantly lower perioperative and 10-year stroke rates (13.3% vs 17.9%). The question of whether modern medical therapy (including statins) is equivalent or superior to CEA or CAS has not yet been addressed by well-designed, appropriately funded, prospective, multicenter, and randomized trials.

Antithrombotic therapy — history of cerebrovascular disease (CVD): For prior TIA or cerebrovascular accident with VTE requiring AC, the pathway recommends stopping all APT and treating with an AC alone (DOAC preferred) when safe from hemorrhagic transformation, typically between 2 and 14 days after the acute event; given that TIA has no infarct or hemorrhage on imaging, an AC can typically be initiated immediately. After recent carotid endarterectomy, stop all APT and treat with an AC alone (DOAC preferred) when safe from post-operative bleeding, typically 3 to 14 days after surgery. For carotid stenting within the previous 1 to 3 months, stop aspirin, continue the P2Y12i (clopidogrel preferred), and start an AC (DOAC preferred); once the standard DAPT duration has ended (usually 1 to 3 months), all APT may be stopped and most patients can be treated with an AC alone.

### Updated Society for Vascular Surgery guidelines for management of extracranial carotid disease [^115MtmdY]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2011). Medium credibility.

Society for Vascular Surgery — Medical management of carotid atherosclerosis emphasizes risk-factor modification and antithrombotic therapy with specified perioperative regimens. In patients with carotid artery stenosis, treatment of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and smoking cessation are recommended to reduce overall cardiovascular risk and risk of stroke, with targets defined by the National Cholesterol Education Program guidelines (GRADE 1, Level of Evidence A). Aggressive treatment of hypertension in the setting of acute stroke is not recommended; after this period, treatment is associated with reduced risk of subsequent stroke and target parameters are not well defined (GRADE 1, Level of Evidence C). Tight glucose control in diabetes has not been shown to reduce stroke risk or decrease complication rates after carotid endarterectomy (CEA) and is not recommended for these purposes (GRADE 2, Level of Evidence A). Anticoagulation is not recommended for transient ischemic attack (TIA) or acute stroke unless there is evidence of a cardioembolic source (GRADE 1, Level of Evidence B). In asymptomatic carotid atherosclerosis, antiplatelet therapy is recommended to reduce overall cardiovascular morbidity but has not been shown effective for primary prevention of stroke (GRADE 1, Level of Evidence A). For secondary stroke prevention, aspirin, aspirin plus dipyridamole, and clopidogrel are all effective, but clopidogrel plus aspirin is not more effective than either drug alone (GRADE 1, Level of Evidence B). Perioperative medical management for carotid revascularization should include blood pressure control (< 140/80 mm Hg), β-blockade (heart rate, 60–80 beats/min), and statin therapy (LDL < 100 mg/dL) (GRADE 1, Level of Evidence B). Perioperative antithrombotic therapy for CEA should include aspirin (81–325 mg) (GRADE 1, Level of Evidence A), while use of clopidogrel perioperatively should be decided case-by-case (GRADE 2 Level of Evidence B). For carotid artery stenting (CAS), perioperative antithrombotic management should include dual-antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and ticlopidine or clopidogrel; dual therapy should be initiated at least 3 days before CAS and continued for 1 month, and aspirin should be continued indefinitely (GRADE 1, Level of Evidence C).

Perioperative medical therapy for carotid artery stenting (CAS) — Antihypertensive, β-blocker, and lipid-lowering therapy should be initiated in patients undergoing CAS according to the same recommendations for CEA. Patients should be started on dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin (325 mg) and clopidogrel (75 mg) or ticlopidine (250 mg) before CAS. No randomized trial has yet compared CAS performed with dual-antiplatelet therapy vs aspirin alone, but the published periprocedural stroke, MI, and death rates in recent clinical trials have been achieved with this combination therapy.

### Updated Society for Vascular Surgery guidelines for management of extracranial carotid disease [^112SVWEo]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2011). Medium credibility.

Carotid atherosclerosis — antithrombotic treatment: No adequately powered studies have been performed in asymptomatic patients with carotid atherosclerosis to confirm a benefit with antithrombotic treatment in reducing incident stroke. The US Preventive Services Task Force has recommended daily aspirin as cardiovascular prophylaxis in patients with anticipated cardiac morbidity of > 3% for men aged > 45 years and in women aged > 55 years, and the AHA Primary Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease and Stroke agrees with this recommendation; there is no evidence to suggest that antiplatelet agents other than aspirin have improved benefit in asymptomatic patients. For non-cardioembolic ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) associated with carotid atherosclerosis, antiplatelet agents are recommended, with aspirin (50–325 mg), the combination of aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole, and clopidogrel described as acceptable options for initial therapy, while a combination of aspirin and clopidogrel is not recommended; aspirin is widely used, with as many as 30 million Americans on long-term regimens.

Regarding perioperative care for carotid artery stenosis, more specifically with respect to perioperative antiplatelet therapy, carotid artery stenting, ESVS 2023 guidelines recommend to initiate combination antiplatelet therapy with aspirin (75–325 mg daily) and clopidogrel (75 mg daily) in recently symptomatic patients undergoing carotid artery stenting. Start clopidogrel (75 mg daily) at least 3 days before stenting or as a single 300 mg loading dose in urgent cases. Continue aspirin and clopidogrel for at least 4 weeks after stenting and then continue antiplatelet monotherapy (preferably clopidogrel 75 mg daily) indefinitely.

### Can randomized trial outcomes for carotid endarterectomy be achieved in community-wide practice? [^114c6pw5]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

The benefit of carotid endarterectomy (CEA) is dependent upon achieving procedural outcomes comparable to those observed in randomized trials. We have extensively examined outcomes of the procedure in the community with a complete medical record (hospital chart) review of over 20,000 Medicare patients undergoing CEA in 10 states. In patients with comparable indications, overall risk of stroke or death of 6.9% in our Medicare studies was comparable to the 6.5% combined event rate in the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial. In asymptomatic patients, however, the overall Medicare study result of 3.8% was inferior to the benchmark perioperative combined event rate of 1.5% achieved in the Asymptomatic Carotid Atherosclerosis Study. Our data demonstrated that the randomized trial benchmarks could be achieved or even exceeded at a statewide level. Our studies also documented that evidence-based processes that can reduce perioperative stroke and death (eg, perioperative antiplatelet therapy, patching) are underutilized in the community. Overall process and outcomes assessment show considerable room for improvement. All surgeons performing CEA should use a system-based approach to ensure that all evidence-based processes are employed for patients undergoing CEA and should use indication stratification to document their own outcomes for the procedure.

### Carotid endarterectomy: still the standard of care for carotid bifurcation disease [^115bZ6JK]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Current treatment guidelines of symptomatic and asymptomatic carotid stenosis are based on studies performed over a decade ago. Since that time, significant advances have been made in medical management, namely high dose statin therapy and improved antiplatelet agents, and in carotid interventions, namely the advent of carotid artery stenting. Especially with carotid stenting, the technology has grown by leaps and bounds and continues to advance at a rapid pace. These advances have necessitated new studies to compare these treatments with the gold standard of carotid endarterectomy. In asymptomatic patients, the current data does not justify medical management alone for severe (> 80%) carotid stenosis. Furthermore, in both asymptomatic and symptomatic patients current studies have failed to demonstrate equivalence of CAS to CEA for significant carotid stenosis. Clearly additional studies comparing CAS, CEA, and medical management are needed to further clarify this issue. In the future, advances in CAS technology and techniques may greatly expand the role of CAS beyond its current role in certain high-risk patient subsets. However, for the time being CEA still remains the gold standard for carotid intervention.

### Effects of sarpogrelate combined with aspirin in patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy in China: a single-center retrospective study [^113ChLA7]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Patients undergoing carotid artery stenosis who are prescribed aspirin, clopidogrel, or sarpogrelate as treatment options to inhibit platelet aggregation continues to increase. The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of clopidogrel combined with aspirin (CA) versus sarpogrelate combined with aspirin (SA) treatment in carotid endarterectomy (CEA) patients.

Methods

This retrospective study included 197 CEA patients (mean age 61.4 years, mean follow-up time 42.5 months), who were divided into a CA group (Group A: 65 male and 44 female patients) and an SA group (Group B: 58 male and 30 female patients). Preoperative demographic and clinical characteristics and postoperative results were compared between the 2 groups and statistically analyzed.

Results

Preoperative demographic and clinical characteristics, transfusions, hospital stay, occurrence of transient ischemic attack, stroke, myocardial infarction, restenosis, general or life-threatening bleeding, and 30-day mortality showed no significant differences between the 2 CEA patient groups. However, the mean operative blood loss (P = 0.023) and the operative time (P = 0.040) were significantly higher in Group A compared with Group B. A highly significant incidence of neck hematoma (P = 0.024) was observed in patients of Group A.

Conclusions

In this study on CEA patients, antiplatelet treatment with CA resulted in a significant risk of developing neck hematoma, increased operative blood loss, and operative time compared with SA treatment. Long-term prospective studies with larger study populations are needed to further confirm the utility of SA treatment for CEA patients.

### The evidence for medicine versus surgery for carotid stenosis [^115nGnSi]. European Journal of Radiology (2006). Low credibility.

Atherosclerotic stenosis of the internal carotid artery is an important cause of stroke. Several large randomised trials have compared best medical management with carotid endarterectomy and provide a strong evidence base for advising and selecting patients for carotid surgery. Best medical management of carotid stenosis includes lowering of blood pressure, treatment with statins and antiplatelet therapy in symptomatic patients. Combined analysis of the symptomatic carotid surgery trials, together with observational data, has shown that patients with recently symptomatic severe carotid stenosis have a very high risk of recurrent stroke in the first few days and weeks after symptoms. Carotid endarterectomy has a risk of causing stroke or death at the time of surgery in symptomatic patients of around 5–7%, but in patients with recently symptomatic stenosis of more than 70%, the benefits of endarterectomy outweigh the risks. In patients with moderate stenosis of between 50 and 69%, the benefits may justify surgery in patients with very recent symptoms, and in patients older than 75 years within a few months of symptoms. Patients with less than 50% stenosis do not benefit from surgery. In asymptomatic patients, or those whose symptoms occurred more than 6 months ago, the benefits of surgery are considerably less. Patients with asymptomatic stenosis treated medically only have a small risk of future stroke when treated medically of about 2% per annum. If carotid endarterectomy can be performed safely with a perioperative stroke and death rate of no more than 3%, then the randomised trials showed a significant benefit of surgery over 5 years follow-up, with an overall reduction in the risk of stroke from about 11% over 5 years down to 6%. However, of 100 patients operated, only 5 will benefit from avoiding a stroke over 5 years. The majority of neurologists have concluded that this does not justify a policy of routine screening and endarterectomy for asymptomatic stenosis. Patients known to have asymptomatic stenosis should be advised of the risks and benefits. The trials provide justification for surgery at centres with a proven low complication rate, in asymptomatic patients prepared to take a small immediate risk in exchange for a small longer term benefit. Those that opt for medical management alone should be advised to seek urgent medical attention should they become symptomatic in the future.

### What does' best medical therapy' really mean? [^111rjwsB]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Carotid disease is like any other atherosclerotic manifestation, a condition, which may induce thrombosis, in this case with subsequent cerebral ischemia. Carotid endarterectomy has proven effective in preventing ipsilateral stroke, however, the studies providing the evidence were conducted before the use of statins, newer antiplatelet and antihypertensive drugs, and at a time when less emphasis was on lifestyle modification. Therefore, it is likely that, not only would all patients with carotid stenosis benefit from modern medical treatment, in addition, some patients could have similar risk reduction to that of endarterectomy, were these effective preventive drugs used systematically, as recommended, in this patient group. This article reviews the evidence that is available concerning medical therapy for patients with carotid stenosis, with special emphasis on antiplatelet and statin therapy. An example on how this treatment may be organised is given.

### Carotid endarterectomy: can we select surgical candidates at high risk for stroke and low risk for perioperative complications? [^117Ca23E]. Neurosurgery (2001). Low credibility.

DESPITE EVIDENCE OF the efficacy of carotid endarterectomy from the large randomized multicenter trials completed in the 1990s, the physician who treats patients with carotid artery stenosis still is faced with a difficult management decision. More recently, subgroup analyses have been conducted of asymptomatic and symptomatic patients enrolled in these trials to identify clinical and radiological factors that increase the rates of morbidity and mortality associated with surgery, as well as those that increase the risk of stroke without surgery. Knowledge of these factors is important to recommend the best course of action for the individual patient. In this article, we summarize the conclusions of some of the subgroup analyses from the major carotid endarterectomy trials.

### Carotid endarterectomy: who is the high-risk patient? [^112Sd1vG]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

The role of carotid endarterectomy in the prevention of stroke was validated by two randomized clinical trials, the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy (NASCET) and the Asymptomatic Carotid Atherosclerosis Study (ACAS). However, these trials excluded patients at high risk for perioperative stroke and other morbidity, raising concerns for the applicability of the trial results to the general population. Some have also suggested these "high-risk" patients are better suited for carotid artery stenting with the belief that stenting has lower morbidity and mortality. In this article, we review many of the commonly accepted high-risk factors for carotid endarterectomy (CEA) and examine their outcomes. High-risk patients are more common than generally believed and their outcomes may be the same with carotid endarterectomy as it is with carotid stenting. Truly "high-risk" patients with shortened life expectancy are best served with no intervention.

### Low molecular weight heparin significantly reduces embolisation after carotid endarterectomy – a randomised controlled trial [^114butWb]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Objectives

The administration of unfractionated heparin (UFH) prior to carotid clamping during carotid endarterectomy (CEA) transiently increases the platelet aggregation response to arachidonic acid (AA) despite the use of aspirin. We hypothesized that this phenomenon might be reduced by using low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) resulting in fewer emboli in the early post-operative period.

Methods

183 aspirinated patients undergoing CEA were randomised to 5000 IU UFH (n = 91) or 2500 IU LMWH (dalteparin, n = 92) prior to carotid clamping. End-points were: transcranial Doppler (TCD) measurement of embolisation, effect on bleeding and platelet aggregation to AA and adenosine 5'-diphosphate (ADP).

Results

Patients randomised to UFH had twice the odds of experiencing a higher number of emboli in the first 3h after CEA, than those randomised to LMWH (p = 0.04). This was not associated with increased bleeding (mean time from flow restoration to operation end: 23 min (UFH) vs. 24 min (LMWH), p = 0.18). Platelet aggregation to AA increased significantly following heparinisation, but was unaffected by heparin type (p = 0.90). The platelets of patients randomised to LMWH exhibited significantly lower aggregation to ADP compared to UFH (p < 0.0001).

Conclusions

Intravenous LMWH is associated with a significant reduction in post-operative embolisation without increased bleeding. The higher rate of embolisation seen with UFH may be mediated by increased platelet aggregation to ADP, rather than to AA.

### Antiplatelet drugs: antithrombotic therapy and prevention of thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^115vrFES]. Chest (2012). Medium credibility.

Optimal dose of aspirin — low-dose effectiveness: Placebo-controlled randomized trials have shown that aspirin is an effective antithrombotic agent when used long term in doses ranging between 50 and 100 mg/d, and there are data to suggest that it is effective in doses as low as 30 mg/d. At a dose of 75 mg/d, aspirin was shown to (1) reduce the risk of acute myocardial infarction (MI) or death in patients with unstable angina or chronic stable angina, (2) reduce the risk of stroke or death in patients with transient cerebral ischemia, and (3) reduce the risk of stroke after carotid endarterectomy. In the European Stroke Prevention Study (ESPS)-2, aspirin 25 mg bid reduced the risk of stroke and the composite outcome of stroke or death in patients with prior stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA). In the European Collaboration on Low-dose Aspirin in Polycythemia vera trial, aspirin (100 mg/d) was effective in preventing thrombotic complications in patients with polycythemia vera, even in the face of higher-than-normal platelet counts.

### Assessment and management of peripheral arterial disease: what every cardiologist should know [^115SosfN]. Heart (2021). Medium credibility.

Carotid artery disease

Approximately 10%–20% of thromboembolic stroke is thought to be from significant extracranial carotid artery disease. Generally, significant stenosis refers to a > 50% stenosis estimated using the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial method. In clinical trials, patients are often stratified to 50%–69% stenosis and 70%–99% stenosis. Revascularisation is not indicated for a near-occluded or occluded carotid artery. A carotid stenosis is defined as 'symptomatic' if there is ischaemic symptoms within preceding 6 months. Abnormalities on brain imaging studies without symptoms are generally not considered 'symptomatic'.

Early revascularisation is well-established as the standard of care for patients with symptomatic carotid artery stenosis (figure 2). Multiple randomised clinical trials (RCTs) have consistently found carotid endarterectomy (CEA) to be superior to medical therapy alone in this population. Clinical features associated with higher benefits from CEA are more severe carotid lesions (70%–99%), male sex, older age (> 75 years) and hemispheric and cortical strokes (as opposed to retinal or lacunar strokes). The benefits of CEA are greatest within 14 days of the ischaemic event and decline as time passes.

Figure 2
Diagnostic algorithm for patients with symptomatic carotid artery disease. *Symptoms of stroke/transient ischaemic attack within 6 months.

The management of asymptomatic carotid disease is more controversial. Early trials found better outcomes with CEA compared with medical therapy for significant carotid disease in asymptomatic patients. However, medical therapy has evolved greatly since the 1990s and early 2000s when there were little statin use, no antithrombotic option other than aspirin and no specific goal for treating blood pressure and diabetes. Lacking newer data, the ESC/ESVS guideline only recommends revascularisation in asymptomatic patients with 60%–99% who have additional risk factors, such as a history of contralateral transient ischaemic attack/stroke, ipsilateral silent infarction or anatomically high-risk findings on imaging (lipid-rich core or intraplaque haemorrhage on MRA, large echolucent and hypoechogenic plaque on ultrasound or rapid stenosis progression) (Figure 3). The ongoing CREST-2 (carotid revascularization for primary prevention of stroke) trial will help determine whether CEA, carotid artery stenting (CAS) or modern medical therapy is the best strategy for patients with asymptomatic significant carotid stenosis.

### Systematic review and meta-analysis of dual versus single antiplatelet therapy in carotid interventions [^114cDnR4]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The importance of antiplatelet therapy for the management and prevention of ischaemic stroke cannot be overstated. Despite the established guidelines, there is no clear consensus on how to manage antiplatelet therapy during and after carotid interventions.

Objective

The objective was to undertake a systematic literature review and perform a meta-analysis to assess the effects of dual antiplatelet therapy in carotid endarterectomy (CEA) and stenting (CAS).

Data Sources

Electronic information sources (MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, CENTRAL) and bibliographic reference lists were searched to identify randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies reporting comparative outcomes of dual versus single antiplatelet therapy in CEA and CAS.

Methods

Primary outcomes were mortality and stroke within 30 days of intervention. Secondary outcomes were transient ischaemic attack (TIA), major bleeding, groin or neck haematoma, and myocardial infarction (MI). Dichotomous outcome measures were reported using the risk difference (RD) and 95% confidence interval (CI). Combined overall treatment effects were calculated using fixed-effect or random-effects models.

Results

Three RCTs and seven observational studies were identified reporting a total of 36,881 CEAs and 150 CAS procedures. In CEA, there were no differences in stroke/TIA/death between single and dual antiplatelet therapy, but there was a significant risk of major bleeding (RD, 0.00; 95% CI, 0.00–0.01; p = .0003) and neck haematoma with dual therapy (RD, 0.04; 95% CI, 0.01–0.06; p = .001). In addition, the rate of MI was higher in the dual therapy group than the single therapy group (RD, 0.00; 95% CI, 0.00–0.01; p = .003). In CAS, there was no difference in major bleeding or haematoma formation, but a significant difference in TIA in favour of dual therapy was identified (RD -0.13, 95% CI, -0.22 to -0.05; p = .003).

Conclusions

Dual antiplatelet therapy demonstrates advantages over single therapy only in CAS, as indicated by a reduced risk of TIA. Dual antiplatelet therapy was associated with an increased risk of bleeding complications in patients undergoing CEA.

### Urgent endarterectomy for symptomatic carotid occlusion is associated with a high mortality [^114UFQvK]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

Interventions for carotid occlusions undertaken are undertaken and the outcomes are poorly defined. We sought to study patients undergoing urgent carotid revascularization for symptomatic occlusions.

Methods

The Society for Vascular Surgery Vascular Quality Initiative database was queried from 2003 to 2020 to identify patients with carotid occlusions undergoing carotid endarterectomy. Only symptomatic patients undergoing urgent interventions within 24 hours of presentation were included. Patients were identified based on computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. This cohort was compared with symptomatic patients undergoing urgent intervention for severe stenosis (≥ 80%). The primary end points were perioperative stroke, death, myocardial infarction (MI) and composite outcomes as defined by the Society for Vascular Surgery reporting guidelines. Patient characteristics were analyzed to determine predictors of perioperative mortality and neurological events.

Results

We identified 390 patients who underwent urgent CEA for symptomatic occlusions. The mean age was 67.4 ± 10.2 years (range, 39–90 years). The cohort was predominantly male (60%) with associated risk factors for cerebrovascular disease, including hypertension (87.4%), diabetes (34.4%), coronary artery disease (21.6%), and current smoking (38.7%). This population had high use of medications, including statins (78.6%), P2Y 12 inhibitors (32.0%), aspirin (77.9%), and renin-angiotensin inhibitors (43.7%) preoperatively. When compared with patients undergoing urgent endarterectomy for severe stenosis (≥ 80%), those with symptomatic occlusion were well-matched with regard to risk factors, but the severe stenosis cohort seemed to be managed better medically and less likely to present with cortical stroke symptoms. Perioperative outcomes were significantly worse for the carotid occlusion cohort, primarily driven by higher perioperative mortality (2.8% vs 0.9%; P < .001). The composite end point of stroke/death/MI was also significantly worse in the occlusion cohort (7.7% vs 4.9%; p = 0.014). On multivariate analysis, carotid occlusion was associated with increased mortality (odds ratio, 3.028; 95% confidence interval, 1.362–6.730; p = 0.007) and composite outcome of stroke, death, or MI (odds ratio, 1.790; 95% confidence interval, 1.135–2.822; p = 0.012).

Conclusions

Revascularization for symptomatic carotid occlusion constitutes approximately 2% of carotid interventions captured in the Vascular Quality Initiative, affirming the rarity of this undertaking. These patients have acceptable rates of perioperative neurological events, but are at an elevated risk of overall perioperative adverse events, primarily driven by higher mortality, compared with those with severe stenosis. Carotid occlusion seems to be the most significant risk factor for the composite end point of perioperative stroke, death, or MI. Although intervention for a symptomatic carotid occlusion may be performed with acceptable rate of perioperative complications, judicious patient selection is warranted in this high-risk cohort.

### Editor's choice-risk of bleeding complications with different peri-operative antithrombotic regimens during carotid endarterectomy: a national registry analysis [^114khuRd]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

Antithrombotic therapy is one of the cornerstones of the prevention of (recurrent) ocular or cerebral ischaemic events in patients with carotid artery stenosis. Randomised controlled trials on antithrombotic therapy for patients with minor ischaemic stroke and transient ischaemic attack (TIA) have recommended dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) in the three weeks following the index event. However, these trials excluded patients undergoing carotid revascularisation. To date, the optimal antithrombotic therapy during the peri-operative period of carotid endarterectomy (CEA) remains unclear.

Methods

Symptomatic and asymptomatic patients with carotid artery stenosis undergoing primary CEA from the Dutch Audit for Carotid Interventions registry between June 2013 and December 2020 were eligible for inclusion. The primary outcome was defined as post-operative cervical bleeding needing re-intervention or intracranial haemorrhage during the first 30 days following CEA. The secondary outcomes were ischaemic stroke or TIA or all cause mortality during the first 30 days following CEA. Descriptive statistics and multiple logistic regressions analyses were applied, with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) as the reference value.

Results

A total of 12 317 patients were included. In the peri-operative phase, 31.0% of patients were treated with ASA, 32.4% with clopidogrel, 11.1% with ASA plus clopidogrel, 10.4% with ASA plus dipyridamole, 10.3% with vitamin K antagonist, and 4.8% with direct acting oral anticoagulants therapy. After multiple logistic regression analysis, no association was seen with the primary outcome in ASA plus clopidogrel (odds ratio [OR] 0.81; confidence interval [CI] 0.58–1.13; p = .23), and ASA plus dipyridamole (OR 0.69; CI 0.47–1.00; p = .059). Both the DAPT therapies were not associated with the secondary outcome.

Conclusion

The effectiveness and safety of DAPT did not differ from single antiplatelet therapy (SAPT) in patients undergoing CEA and further evaluation is needed in prospective studies. Considering additional data from the literature and guideline recommendations, DAPT should be started immediately after stroke until 30 days after CEA followed by SAPT, due to a possible reduction in the risk of recurrence.

### Outcomes related to antiplatelet or anticoagulation use in patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy [^115jimiS]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Background

The number of cases involving patients undergoing vascular procedures who are prescribed clopidogrel or warfarin as treatment options continues to rise. Our aim was to examine outcomes related to antiplatelet or anticoagulation therapy in patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy (CEA).

Methods

A retrospective review of 260 consecutive patients undergoing CEA. Data including patient demographics, operative details, perioperative use of aspirin (ASA), clopidogrel, or warfarin, and early and/or late outcome(s) were collected. Endpoints included postoperative morbidity and/or mortality rate(s) and bleeding complications.

Results

The study included 152 men and 108 women (mean age = 69.3 years), with a mean follow-up of 406 days. In all, 46% of endarterectomies were for a symptomatic disease. The technique of eversion endarterectomy was applied in 126 (48.5%), Dacron-patch in 112 (43.1%), and bovine pericardial-patch in 14 (5.4%) of the cases. Among the patients, 171 were taking ASA, 50 were taking clopidogrel ± ASA, and 10 were taking warfarin (mean INR = 1.62; range, 1.2–2.1); the remaining 29 were not on any antiplatelet therapy. All patients who were on warfarin therapy underwent an eversion endarterectomy. Overall, there were 19 (7.3%) complications (12 major and seven minor). The 30-day stroke rate and stroke death rate was 0.7% and 1.1%, respectively. Patients taking clopidogrel developed more number of neck hematomas (16% vs. 1.7%, p = 0.0004) compared with patients who were on ASA alone. For patients taking clopidogrel, Dacron-patch repair resulted in more hematomas than eversion endarterectomy (35% vs. 4.2%, p = 0.012). There was no difference in the incidence of neck hematoma on the basis of endarterectomy technique in patients who were on ASA alone. The patients taking warfarin neither had a perioperative complication nor developed a neck hematoma.

Conclusions

In this study, clopidogrel use during CEA resulted in a significant risk for developing a neck hematoma, particularly when using a Dacron-patch. The risk of a neck hematoma in patients who were on clopidogrel was much less when an eversion endarterectomy was performed.

### Surgery insight: carotid endarterectomy – which patients to treat and when? [^1124V6ta]. Nature Clinical Practice: Cardiovascular Medicine (2007). Medium credibility.

Over the past 15 years, we have witnessed a resurgence of surgery for prevention of ischemic stroke. Landmark trials including the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial and the European Carotid Surgery Trial have explored the role of carotid endarterectomy in this context, comparing the procedure with best medical treatment in patients with high-grade stenosis of the internal carotid artery and transient ischemic attack or minor nondisabling stroke in the same territory. Here, we discuss the lessons learnt from these trials, and review the Asymptomatic Carotid Atherosclerosis Study and the Asymptomatic Carotid Surgery Trial, which attempted to resolve the rather vexing issue of surgical treatment for patients with asymptomatic internal carotid artery stenosis. We also review the best medical treatment for patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy in the perioperative period, and examine the risk of ischemic stroke after CABG surgery, both when this procedure is performed alongside endarterectomy and when CABG surgery and endarterectomy are performed as a two-staged procedure.

### Asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis: revascularization [^111rQvkg]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

In patients with carotid stenosis, the most common cause of stroke is atheroembolization, and the risk is strongly related to stenosis severity and symptomatic status (stroke or transient ischemic attack within 6months). Carotid revascularization by carotid endarterectomy (CEA) or carotid artery stenting (CAS) results in plaque "passivation" by lumen enlargement, plaque removal, or plaque coverage with subsequent endothelialization. While there is considerable circumstantial evidence linking a decrease in the risk of stroke to the use of "optimal medical therapy (OMT)", the components of OMT have not been defined, and such therapy has not been rigorously evaluated in any randomized clinical trial (RCT) compared with revascularization. Studies of other vascular patients suggest that statins decrease the risk of stroke by anti-inflammatory effects, rather than cholesterol reduction. The Carotid Revascularization Endarterectomy versus Stent Trial (CREST-2) is currently randomizing standard-risk patients with asymptomatic severe carotid stenosis to OMT alone versus OMT plus CEA or CAS, but results are not expected until 2020. In the meantime, data from several "landmark" trials of CEA versus aspirin demonstrated 45–65% reduction in the 5-year risk of stroke after CEA. Several RCTs demonstrate superiority of CAS over CEA in high-risk patients (those at high-risk for CEA), and equivalence of CAS and CEA in standard-risk patients (those at acceptable risk for CEA). Compared with CEA, CAS is associated with significantly less periprocedural myocardial infarction, cranial nerve injury, and neurological injury (cranial nerve injury plus stroke); higher risk of minor stroke; and similar risk of long-term stroke. Features that increase the risk of CAS include complex aortic arch and carotid anatomy, and features that increase the risk of CEA include severe underlying cardiopulmonary disease and hostile neck anatomy; age > 80years, especially those with baseline cognitive impairment, are at higher risk for stroke after CEA and CAS.

Asymptomatic extracranial or intracranial stenosis

Recommendations

Patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis are recommended to take aspirin and statin on a daily basis (class IIa; level of evidence C).
Patients with carotid stenosis > 50% should be screened for other treatable risk factors of stroke. Appropriate medical therapies and a healthy lifestyle should be implimented, such as smoke-quitting, healthy diet and proper physical exercise (class I; level of evidence C).
In patients with carotid stenosis of 60%–99% and expected lifetime over 5 years, it is reasonable to consider performing carotid endarterectomy (CEA) and be done in qualified hospitals if the risk of perioperative stroke and death is low (< 3%) (class IIa; level of evidence B). Unless contraindicated, patients are recommended to take aspirin perioperatively and postoperatively (class I; level of evidence C).
Prophylactic carotid artery stenting (CAS) might be considered in patients with carotid stenosis of 69%–99% but unsuitable for CEA. CAS can be conducted in qualified hospitals if the risk of perioperative stroke and death is low (< 3%), but the effectiveness compared with medical therapy has not been well established (class IIb; level of evidence B).
Screening and following-up with ultrasound in qualified hospitals are recommended in patients with more than two risk factors, in order to better evaluate the progress of stenosis as well as the risk of stroke (class IIa; level of evidence C).
For patients with asymptomatic intracerebral stenosis, it is reasonable to consider antiplatelet and statin treatment (class IIa; level of evidence C).

Heterogeneity of study results

Even though heterogeneity of study results was moderate, relevant aspects of dissimilarities in study designs have to be considered. Most of the studies excluded asymptomatic patients whereas one study evaluated asymptomatic patients exclusivelyand in another trial two thirds of patients were asymptomatic. Moreover, average surgical risk of the study populations were different; the SAPPHIRE trialincluded high risk patients exclusively. This trial, in contrast with most others, found a superiority of carotid artery stenting over carotid endarterectomy. This suggests that since intermediate term outcomes are similar it might be appropriate to select a revascularisation strategy based on the procedural risk of patients. However, exclusion of these two studies including predominantly asymptomatic patients did not change the overall outcome of our analysis.

A major reason for heterogeneity between the studies was because almost half of the trials were stopped prematurely, before the prespecified sample size was reached. Early stopping can lead to overestimation of treatment effects (stop at random high) as shown in several previous analyses. For two of the early stopped trials, however, the decision was not based on differential outcomes but on problems with fundingor recruitment, whereas for three trials the early stopping was based on large differences in risk for the compared treatments. These three trials may have led to some overestimation of the superiority of carotid endarterectomy. This fact highlights the importance of completion of currently ongoing trials — for example, CREST (Carotid Revascularization Endarterectomy versus Stent Trial) and ACT 1 (Asymptomatic Carotid Stenosis, Stenting versus Endarterectomy Trial) — to define the best contemporary carotid revascularisation strategy.

Furthermore, concomitant drug treatment differed among the included trials. Earlier trials required aspirin treatment onlywith no pretreatment, whereas the Wallstent trialused ticlopidine for four weeks after the procedure, and more recent studiesused clopidogrel for about 2–4 weeks after the procedure, often for 72 to 24 hours before the stenting procedure. This may be particularly relevant to the periprocedural outcomes for carotid stenting where inadequate platelet inhibition may predispose to early thrombosis and embolisation with the attendant hazard of stroke.

### Real-world use of medical therapy in moderate asymptomatic carotid stenosis [^114e53E9]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

Despite level 1 evidence demonstrating the benefit of carotid endarterectomy for the prevention of stroke in patients with severe asymptomatic carotid stenosis (ACS), there has been a trend toward recommending optimal medical therapy (OMT) alone. This recommendation has been promulgated based on the observation that modern advances in OMT reduce the overall stroke risk in the general population, but the success of this treatment strategy is dependent on patient and provider adherence. In current practice, patients with moderate ACS are nearly all treated with OMT alone. The objective of this study was to evaluate adherence to OMT in a cohort of patients with moderate ACS undergoing treatment with OMT alone.

Methods

Consecutive carotid duplex ultrasound examinations were reviewed for the years 2019 and 2020. Those with moderate (50%-69%) ACS based on Society for Vascular Surgery guidelines were included in the study. Patients were assessed for OMT at the time of the index duplex, the first follow-up visit, and at each subsequent follow-up visit until the end of the study. OMT was defined as abstinence from smoking, aspirin or other antiplatelet use, and statin or other lipid-lowering therapy. Patients were stratified based on their ability to achieve OMT, and each component was evaluated to identify shortfalls in therapy.

Results

A total of 323 duplex ultrasound examinations with moderate ACS in 255 patients were identified. Of the 255 patients, 143 (56.1%) were on OMT at the time of the first duplex; that number increased to 163 (63.9%) by the first follow-up visit and 175 (68.6%) by the completion of the study. There were 112 (43.9%) patients who were not on OMT at the time of the index duplex, 43 (38.4%) of whom achieved OMT over a median follow-up time of 2.7 years. By the end of follow-up, 86 (76.8%) were taking aspirin or another antiplatelet medication, 93 (83.0%) were on statin or other lipid-lowering therapy, and 74 (66.1%) were abstinent from smoking. Pre-duplex smoking was independently associated with failure to achieve OMT (hazard ratio: 0.452, P = .017).

Conclusions

Among patients with moderate ACS who were not previously on OMT, the rate of OMT achievement is poor. Although advances in lipid management through statin therapy have been praised for their role in improving the effectiveness of OMT, smoking cessation represents an important target for improving uptake and as a result effectiveness of OMT.

### Management of atherosclerotic carotid artery disease: clinical practice guidelines of the Society for Vascular Surgery [^111fEFsb]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2008). Medium credibility.

Asymptomatic carotid stenosis — carotid endarterectomy recommendation: In asymptomatic patients with moderate to severe carotid stenosis (≥ 60%), we recommend carotid endarterectomy plus medical management as long as perioperative risk is low (GRADE 1 recommendation, high quality evidence). Evidence includes a systematic review/meta-analysis of three randomized controlled trials (RCTs) including 5223 asymptomatic patients; stenosis thresholds were ≥ 50% in the Veteran Affairs Cooperative Study and ≥ 60% in ACAS and ACST. The incidence of 30-day perioperative stroke or death was 2.8%, and endarterectomy reduced risk versus medical therapy: relative risk 0.69 (0.57 to 0.83) for perioperative stroke, death or any subsequent stroke, and 0.71 (0.55 to 0.90) for perioperative stroke, death, or subsequent ipsilateral stroke, with no important inconsistency across trials (I2 = 0); for any stroke or death there was a nonsignificant trend favoring surgery (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.02). The committee placed a relatively higher value on preventing stroke disability and morbidity versus avoiding endarterectomy downsides, and in broader contexts clinicians should "consider these as suggestions (GRADE 2)".

### Transient ischemic attack: part II. risk factor modification and treatment [^117GznAR]. American Family Physician (2012). Low credibility.

Interventions following a transient ischemic attack are aimed at preventing a future episode or stroke. Hypertension, current smoking, obesity, physical inactivity, diabetes mellitus, and dyslipidemia are all well-known risk factors, and controlling these factors can have dramatic effects on transient ischemic attack and stroke risk. For patients presenting within 48 hours of resolution of transient ischemic attack symptoms, advantages of hospital admission include rapid diagnostic evaluation and early intervention to reduce the risk of stroke. For long-term prevention of future stroke, the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association recommends antiplatelet agents, statins, and carotid artery intervention for advanced stenosis. Aspirin, extended-release dipyridamole/aspirin, and clopidogrel are acceptable first-line antiplatelet agents. Statins have also been shown to reduce the risk of stroke following transient ischemic attack, with maximal benefit occurring with at least a 50 percent reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level or a target of less than 70 mg per dL (1.81 mmol per L). For those with transient ischemic attack and carotid artery stenosis, carotid endarterectomy is recommended if stenosis is 70 to 99 percent, and perioperative morbidity and mortality are estimated to be less than 6 percent.

Antiplatelet therapy is recommended for patients with symptomatic carotid stenosis, and antihypertensive therapy and statins are recommended; a trial of 2 lipid targets showed that an LDL target of < 70 mg/dL reduced vascular events compared with a target of 90 to 110 mg/dL and included patients with symptomatic carotid stenosis. Additional analyses found benefit in 50% to 69% ICA stenosis quantified as 4.6% over 5 years, with the number needed to treat to prevent 1 stroke higher in women than men (36 versus 9). In pooled carotid artery stenting (CAS) versus CEA analyses of 4754 patients from 4 clinical trials, within 120 days of study entry the hazard ratio for those aged 65 to 69 years was 1.61 (95% CI, 0.90–2.88).

Introduction

Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) have established that carotid endarterectomy (CEA) is beneficial in preventing stroke in both asymptomatic, and symptomatic patients, with carotid stenosis. However, the most recent of the 3 trials that established the clinical benefit of CEA compared with medical therapy in asymptomatic patients was initiated 25 years ago. In the intervening period, new pharmacological advances, such as high-potency statins, and improved antiplatelet regimens, as well as quality improvements in the treatment of blood pressure, and diabetesmay be associated with the reduced stroke rate among patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis. Empirical evidence in support of a reduction in stroke risk among patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis has been provided by a systematic review of several studies. If the decrease in stroke rate among patients with carotid artery stenosis is associated with improvements in primary stroke prevention, revascularization may no longer be the preferred treatment strategy.

Since the first RCT was published that demonstrated the superiority of CEA compared with medical therapy for patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis, concerns have emerged that the outcomes seen in a clinical trial setting may not be reproducible in non-RCT settings because of demonstrated less optimal surgical outcomes, higher complication rates in low-volume hospitals, and poor patient selection. The risk to benefit ratio of interventions may be less favorable outside of RCTs. In addition, although a much larger clinical benefit has been observed in treating patients with symptomatic carotid stenosis, most interventions have been performed on patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis. Furthermore, substantial international variation exists in using revascularization for the treatment of asymptomatic carotid stenosis, suggesting changing attitudes about the use of CEA. These changing practice patterns indicate a need to improve understanding of the long-term clinical benefit of this procedure outside of an RCT.

In this study, we used data from the US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and Medicare to mimic the design and analysis methods of an RCT and to examine whether early intervention (CEA) was superior to initial medical therapy in real-world practice. We hypothesized that the clinical superiority once observed in patients who received CEA has diminished, making medical therapy a more favorable treatment strategy in comparison. We also hypothesized that among carefully selected patients, CEA may still be superior to medical therapy.

Remarks state that "Aspirin slightly reduces total mortality regardless of cardiovascular risk profile if taken over 10 years". They add, "In people at moderate to high risk of cardiovascular events, the reduction in MI is closely balanced with an increase in major bleeds", and "Whatever their risk status, people who are averse to taking medication over a prolonged time period for very small benefits will be disinclined to use aspirin for primary prophylaxis".

Society for Vascular Surgery carotid artery disease — areas without consensus note that we could not completely agree on the role of carotid stenting in asymptomatic patients and that data supporting stenting in this setting were of poor quality because of the absence of a medically managed control group; a minority felt that patients with acceptable medical risk, high anatomic risk, and compelling carotid pathology should be considered candidates for stenting, whereas a minority felt that in the absence of trials comparing medical therapy with stenting in this cohort, such a recommendation, even as GRADE 2 was ill advised. We also failed to reach consensus over many details in the technical performance of endarterectomy and stenting, and supporting data were inconsistent and generally of low quality and that all recommendations were GRADE 2 (at best), including whether protamine reversal of heparin after carotid clamping should be recommended or not recommended and optimal cerebral monitoring and protection during endarterectomy or the preferred patch for use in carotid closure.

### Timing of carotid intervention [^114asK69]. The British Journal of Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

In most patients the indication for carotid intervention has been based on neurological symptoms in combination with the degree of stenosis in the ipsilateral carotid artery. Recently, the role of timing of revascularization in the prevention of recurrent stroke in symptomatic patients has gained interest. The evidence to underpin early surgery is principally based on a post hoc subgroup analysis performed by the Carotid Endarterectomy Trialists Collaboration (CETC) on pooled data from two RCTs 1. The results of these RCTs were published almost three decades ago, and patient adherence to antiplatelet therapy and statin was low to moderate. The number of patients needed to operate to prevent one ipsilateral stroke in 5 years' time was five for patients randomized within 2 weeks following their last ischaemic event compared with 125 when randomized after more than 12 weeks 1. However, this was not a preplanned analysis and is therefore subject to potential confounding. The 2‐week threshold was selected for methodological convenience rather than having any clinical relevance. Some subgroups, such as men with non‐ocular events, may benefit fully 14 days or more after the initial event, whereas the benefit for subgroups at low risk of recurrent stroke (such as women with ocular symptoms) remains uncertain and is being investigated in ECST‐2 (European Carotid Surgery Trials 2). Nevertheless, based on the CETC analysis, most international guidelines on the treatment of carotid artery disease now recommend that carotid revascularization is undertaken within 14 days of the index event 2.

Unfortunately, there are few data on the outcomes of surgery in patients undergoing early carotid revascularization. Of the 12 RCTs 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 that have compared carotid endarterectomy (CEA) with carotid artery stenting (CAS) in patients with significant carotid stenosis, only five 3, 9, 10, 12, 14 provided information on the time from the index event to revascularization. CREST (Carotid Revascularization Endarterectomy versus Stenting Trial) 10 reported the shortest median interval; this was still 22 days for CEA and 18 days for CAS. In all except two RCTs, the mean delay from the index event to revascularization was greater than 1 month 9, 12, 14. Even in studies that mostly revascularized sooner after the index event, the mean delay was above the 2‐week threshold 3, 10.

### Carotid artery endarterectomy in patients with symptomatic non-stenotic carotid artery disease [^112fAqLS]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Intriguingly, Goyal et al have recently suggested working definitions of SyNC, given that a diagnosis of cryptogenic stroke likely precludes patients from undergoing targeted stroke preventative therapy. In other words, if patients were to meet certain criteria for subtypes of SyNC (definite, likely or probable SyNC based on the presence of various factors), then a targeted approach may be pursued for secondary prevention. Although SyNC represents a plausible aetiology of ipsilateral stroke, confirmatory studies are needed to confirm SyNC as a definite stroke aetiology before any targeted therapy can be evaluated. Whether or not CEA would be a efficacious modality for secondary prevention in such cases requires further evaluation.

Our work indicates that CEA is a safe and well-tolerated intervention in patients with SyNC in the absence of another plausible stroke source. Although it may be that CEA prevents future ischaemic events in such patients, prospective clinical trials are largely needed. This work also suggests that a subpopulation of patients having embolic strokes of unknown aetiology with ipsilateral substenotic carotid disease could harbour thrombogenic lesions in non-stenosing complicated plaques. Therefore, dedicated carotid wall imaging capable to identify plaque disruption at the lumen/wall interface and not just luminal narrowing measurement may be a beneficial component in the workup of patients with embolic strokes of an unknown aetiology.

In addition to the relevance in stroke aetiology, growing clinical evidence has shown an increased risk of ipsilateral recurrent strokes refractory to medical treatment in a subset of patients with SyNC and vulnerable plaque features, in particular IPH. This pathological hallmark of plaque instability is important as current intensive medical management, especially in patients with recurrent strokes, includes dual antiplatelet therapy and in cases of embolic strokes of unknown source, which may paradoxically worsen plaque haemorrhage. In our cohort, 93.7% of patients were on aspirin and half of the patients were also on clopidogrel prior to the intervention, with 71.8% of patients having recurrent ipsilateral cerebrovascular events. Clinically, the management of symptomatic patients with mild carotid stenosis remains challenging. However, CEA may be a valid and an effective therapeutic option as supported by other single centre surgical series.

### Prevention of recurrent ischemic stroke [^113h28nh]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

Recurrent ischemic stroke and transient ischemic attack are common problems in primary care, with stroke survivors averaging 10 outpatient visits per year. Risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, and hypercholesterolemia should be evaluated during each office visit. Attention should be given to lifestyle modification including management of obesity, smoking cessation, reduction in alcohol consumption, and promotion of physical activity. The choice of an antiplatelet agent (e.g., aspirin, ticlopidine, clopidogrel, dipyridamole) or the anticoagulant warfarin is based on the safety, tolerability, effectiveness, and price of each agent. Aspirin is a common first choice for prevention of recurrent stroke, but the combination of dipyridamole and aspirin should be considered for many patients because of its superior effectiveness in two clinical trials. Clopidogrel is recommended for patients with aspirin intolerance or allergy, or for those who cannot tolerate dipyridamole. Warfarin and the combination of aspirin and clopidogrel should not be used in the prevention of ischemic stroke. Carotid endarterectomy is appropriate for select patients; carotid stenting was recently shown to be less effective and less safe than endarterectomy.

### Carotid endarterectomy for symptomatic carotid stenosis [^117NrQnU]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Stroke is the third leading cause of death and the most common cause of long-term disability. Severe narrowing (stenosis) of the carotid artery is an important cause of stroke. Surgical treatment (carotid endarterectomy) may reduce the risk of stroke, but carries a risk of operative complications. This is an update of the Cochrane Review, originally published in 1999, and most recently updated in 2011.

Objectives

To determine the balance of benefit versus risk of endarterectomy plus best medical management compared with best medical management alone, in people with a recent symptomatic carotid stenosis (i.e. transient ischaemic attack (TIA) or non-disabling stroke).

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (last searched in July 2016), CENTRAL (2016, Issue 7), MEDLINE (1966 to July 2016), Embase (1990 to July 2016), Web of Science Core Collection, ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) portal, and handsearched relevant journals and reference lists.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently selected studies, assessed risk of bias, and extracted the data.

Main Results

We included three trials involving 6343 participants. As the trials differed in the methods of measurement of carotid stenosis and in the definition of stroke, we did a pooled analysis of individual patient data on 6092 participants (35,000 patient years of follow-up), after reassessing the carotid angiograms and outcomes from all three trials using the primary electronic data files, and redefined outcome events where necessary, to achieve comparability. On re-analysis, there were no significant differences between the trials in the risks of any of the main outcomes in either of the treatment groups, or in the effects of surgery. Surgery increased the five-year risk of ipsilateral ischaemic stroke in participants with less than 30% stenosis (N = 1746, risk ratio (RR) 1.27, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.80 to 2.01), had no significant effect in participants with 30% to 49% stenosis (N = 1429, RR 0.93, 95%CI 0.62 to 1.38), was of benefit in participants with 50% to 69% stenosis (N = 1549, RR 0.84, 95%CI 0.60 to 1.18), and was highly beneficial in participants with 70% to 99% stenosis without near-occlusion (N = 1095, RR 0.47, 95%CI 0.25 to 0.88). However, there was no evidence of benefit (N = 271, RR 1.03, 95%CI 0.57 to 1.84) in participants with near-occlusions. Ipsilateral ischaemic stroke describes insufficient blood flow to the cerebral hemisphere, secondary to same side severe stenosis of the internal carotid artery.

Authors' Conclusions

Endarterectomy was of some benefit for participants with 50% to 69% symptomatic stenosis (moderate-quality evidence), and highly beneficial for those with 70% to 99% stenosis without near-occlusion (moderate-quality evidence). We found no benefit in people with carotid near-occlusion (high-quality evidence).

### Carotid endarterectomy for asymptomatic carotid stenosis [^114xypV1]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) is of proven benefit in recently-symptomatic patients with severe carotid stenosis. Its role in asymptomatic stenosis is still debated. The Asymptomatic Carotid Surgery Trial (ACST) more than doubled the number of patients randomised to CEA trials. This revised review incorporates the recently published ACST results.

Objectives

Our objective was to determine the effects of CEA for patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (searched May 2004), MEDLINE (1966 to May 2004), EMBASE (1980 to June 2004), Current Contents (1995 to January 1997), and reference lists of relevant articles. We contacted researchers in the field to identify additional published and unpublished studies.

Selection Criteria

All completed randomised trials comparing CEA to medical treatment in patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers extracted data and assessed trial quality. Attempts were made to contact investigators to obtain missing information.

Main Results

Three trials with a total of 5223 patients were included. In these trials, the overall net excess of operation-related perioperative stroke or death was 2.9%. For the primary outcome of perioperative stroke or death or any subsequent stroke, patients undergoing CEA fared better than those treated medically (relative risk (RR) 0.69, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.57 to 0.83). Similarly, for the outcome of perioperative stroke or death or subsequent ipsilateral stroke, there was benefit for the surgical group (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.90). For the outcome of any stroke or death, there was a non-significant trend towards fewer events in the surgical group (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.02). Subgroup analyses were performed for the outcome of perioperative stroke or death or subsequent carotid stroke. CEA appeared more beneficial in men than in women and more beneficial in younger patients than in older patients although the data for age effect were inconclusive. There was no statistically significant difference between the treatment effect estimates in patients with different grades of stenosis but the data were insufficient.

Authors' Conclusions

Despite about a 3% perioperative stroke or death rate, CEA for asymptomatic carotid stenosis reduces the risk of ipsilateral stroke, and any stroke, by approximately 30% over three years. However, the absolute risk reduction is small (approximately 1% per annum over the first few years of follow up in the two largest and most recent trials) but it could be higher with longer follow up.

You are asked to see a 65-year-old man with an asymptomatic high-grade carotid artery stenosis. He is otherwise quite healthy, is receiving appropriate medical management, and has no contraindications for surgery. You recommend a carotid endarterectomy (CEA) as the best prophylactic measure against stroke. During the informed consent process, the patient asks for a specific estimate of the risks. What specific level of risk should you quote to your patient?

### Management of atherosclerotic carotid artery disease: clinical practice guidelines of the Society for Vascular Surgery [^112Ymh1w]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2008). Medium credibility.

Society for Vascular Surgery — symptomatic moderate to severe carotid stenosis: In symptomatic patients with moderate to severe carotid stenosis (≥ 50%) we recommend carotid endarterectomy plus optimal medical therapy (GRADE 1 recommendation, high quality evidence). Values statement: In recommending endarterectomy for symptomatic patients with moderate to severe (≥ 50%) carotid stenosis, the committee placed a relatively higher value on preventing the outcome of stroke with the associated disability and morbidity and a relatively lower value on avoiding the downsides of endarterectomy (cost, perioperative complications such as death, and myocardial infarction). The guideline also notes that no data exist to support or refute the value of endarterectomy for the management of symptomatic patients with nonstenotic but severely ulcerated plaques, and that while there could be a subset of symptomatic patients with less than 50% stenosis that might benefit from CEA, current published data do not permit identification of such a cohort.

Carotid revascularization in patients at increased stroke risk

Some observational data suggest that stroke risk associated with CarAD may have declined in recent years, likely due to advances in medical management. However, contemporary acute carotid-related stroke presenters continue to include those on maximized pharmacologic therapy. Today, there is no randomized evidence to demonstrate the efficacy of pharmacologic therapy alone in reducing carotid-related stroke risk, nor is there any proof that medical management alone is sufficient for stroke prevention in CarAD. Many patients with CarAD remain at elevated stroke risk despite triple medical therapy (antiplatelet agents, statins, and antihypertensive medication). In such cases, low-risk, well-executed carotid revascularization can provide significant benefit. Advances in carotid interventions (such as local anaesthesia and intraoperative quality control via completion imaging in carotid endarterectomy and carotid artery stenting with improved cerebral protection and anti-embolic stents) have significantly improved outcomes, (Figure 1, bottom). Long-term data indicate that carotid revascularization performed alongside medical therapy may offer durable protection against stroke.

### Best evidence for medical therapy for carotid artery stenosis [^11575Cjz]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Carotid atheromatous disease is an important cause of stroke and represents a key target in stroke prevention. Randomized trials have shown the efficacy of carotid endarterectomy in secondary stroke prevention. Carotid stenting presents a less invasive alternative to surgical intervention. Advances in medical management, if compliance can be ensured, are leading to improvement in outcomes when implemented as sole therapy in the treatment of atherosclerotic carotid stenosis. This includes lifestyle modification, blood pressure control, and antiplatelet and statin therapy. Over the last 20 years, the annual rate of ipsilateral stroke associated with asymptomatic carotid stenosis has decreased from 2% to 4% to less than 1%. This is largely due to improvements in medical therapy. However, despite numerous trials and years of clinical research, the optimal management of symptomatic and asymptomatic carotid disease remains controversial. This article presents and summarizes the evidence supporting best medical treatment for carotid artery stenosis.

### Improved outcomes of carotid endarterectomy: the critical role of vascular surgeons [^113jfRWw]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

Improved outcomes after carotid endarterectomy (CEA) have been related to preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative patient and procedural variables. Outcomes after CEA have also been related to other factors that are not clearly related to the patient or the procedure, such as performance of the procedure in high volume hospitals, by high volume surgeons, and by surgeons specializing in vascular surgery. These overlapping surrogate markers of "quality" have been widely quoted and may be used by external parties to limit access to vascular care; however, these markers have unclear significance when examined systematically. Some of the confounding variables that preclude easy interpretation of these markers include interest of the surgeon in the care of vascular patients, surgical talent, surgical judgment, recognition of patients at higher risk for complications, and routine or selective use of adjunctive medications such as beta-blockers, statins, and anti-platelet agents. The practices of vascular surgeons with excellent outcomes after CEA need to be examined critically for these underlying factors that affect not only procedural results but also long-term stroke-free survival.

Their first study, published in 1978, was pharmaceutical. Since "certain drugs… were known to have an inhibitory effect on platelet function and had had promising results among patients with cerebrovascular disease", they tested the effect of a daily dose of 1300 mg of aspirin and 800 mg of sulfinpyrazone, together or alone, in 585 patients with transient ischaemic attacks or minor stroke. Sulfinpyrazone did not fulfil the expectations, but after more than 2 years, aspirin significantly reduced the risk of stroke or death, by 31% for all the patients. For women alone, the risk reduction was not significant. True enough, later studies were to show that the alleged 'aspirin resistance' of women was a chance finding, that the dose of aspirin could be much lower, and that other antiplatelet agents existed, but the Canadian study opened the field.

The other studies involved two different surgical interventions. Both had already been introduced, but mainly on the basis of theory; they had not yet been subjected to the rigour of controlled clinical trials. Bypass surgery, from the territory of the external carotid artery, was becoming en vogue in patients with symptoms of cerebral ischaemia associated with ipsilateral occlusion or stenosis of the carotid or middle cerebral artery. Unfortunately, Barney's multinational trial, published in 1985, failed to find a preventive effect on the occurrence of stroke or stroke-related death in 714 patients randomly assigned to surgical treatment, compared with 633 patients receiving best medical treatment. Carotid endarterectomy in the neck had been an even more common operation with the purpose of preventing stroke, despite concerns about lack of evidence. Barney, retired from hospital duties but continuing as head of a new research institute, launched in January 1988 a trial in 50 centres across Canada and the US; it was stopped after 3 years, after 659 patients with stenosis of 70–99% of the carotid artery had been randomised, because interim analysis showed a significant reduction for major or fatal ipsilateral stroke. Almost simultaneously, this result was confirmed by a European trial of 2200 patients, which had been running from 1981.

By the time of his death in 2016, Barney's contributions to the management of stroke had made him world-famous and earned him honours such as inclusion in the Canadian Hall of Fame and honorary doctorates from the Canadian universities of Western Ontario and Dalhousie, as well from Utrecht (The Netherlands) and from Oxford (UK).

Carotid intervention procedural management — angiography, ACT threshold, and antiplatelet therapy: The completion angiogram must visualize the extra- and intracranial circulation in two or more views. The sheath is removed when the ACT is ≤ 150 seconds; arterial closure devices can be used to obviate the need for normalization of the ACT, and patients are placed on clopidogrel for at least 4 weeks and on aspirin indefinitely.

Silent brain infarcts — prevention — Take a careful history to determine whether the infarction was symptomatic. Implement preventive care recommended by AHA/ASA (American Heart Association/American Stroke Association) guidelines for primary prevention of ischemic stroke. The effectiveness of aspirin to prevent stroke has not been studied in this setting. The clinician should be aware that there is an increased risk for future stroke, and it is reasonable to consider this information when making decisions about anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation, revascularization for carotid stenosis, treatment of hypertension, and initiation of statin therapy, while noting that the role of silent brain infarcts in these decisions has not been studied in randomized controlled trials (RCTs).

### Low-vs. high-dose aspirin after carotid endarterectomy… [^111R4HVN]. AAFP (1999). Low credibility.

The risk of stroke and death in the perioperative period following carotid endarterectomy ranges from 6 to 7 percent. While this risk may be reduced by aspirin therapy, the optimal aspirin dosage has not been established. Taylor and colleagues, of the ASA and Carotid Endarterectomy Trial, compared the effects of four different dosages of aspirin on the rate of perioperative complications among patients who underwent carotid endarterectomy. Four different dosages of aspirin were evaluated: 81, 325, 650 and 1, 300 mg daily. No additional antiplatelet medication was permitted during the study. Each patient was assessed by a neurologist on entry into the study, at the time of hospital discharge, 30 days after carotid endarterectomy and, finally, three months after surgery. At the end of three months, 698 patients remained in the group receiving 81 mg of aspirin per day, 697 in the 325-mg group, 703 in the 650-mg group and 706 in the 1, 300-mg group.

Patients in the four treatment groups were comparable with respect to age, sex, blood pressure, medical history, medication use and other pertinent variables. Compliance with aspirin therapy was over 90 percent during the first 30 days and over 86 percent during the three-month follow-up period. Because no significant differences were noted between the two lower aspirin dosages and the two higher dosages, the authors reported the results in these two groups. Efficacy analysis of 1, 116 patients revealed that stroke occurred in 18 of those receiving low-dose aspirin and in 38 of those receiving high-dose aspirin. The authors conclude that the risk of death, myocardial infarction and stroke within three months of carotid endarterectomy is lower in patients who receive 81 mg or 325 mg of aspirin daily than in patients who receive 650 mg or 1, 300 mg daily.

The authors caution that the results of this study must not be over-generalized: the dosage required to prevent perioperative stroke in patients may differ from the dosage required for stroke prevention in the long-term management of patients at risk of stroke.

### Does stenting produce better results than endarterectomy?… [^114QLdGN]. AAFP (2007). Low credibility.

Background: Angioplasty is the recommended treatment for patients who have substantial stenosis of a carotid artery and high risk of stroke. Recently, carotid artery stenting has been advocated as an alternative treatment to endarterectomy. A Cochrane systematic review concluded that the 30-day safety outcomes of the two treatments did not differ significantly, but that large, well-designed clinical trials were needed. The SPACE trial was designed to compare carotid endarterectomy and carotid artery stenting for severe symptomatic carotid artery stenosis. The Study: The international study enrolled 1, 200 patients at 35 centers. The two groups were comparable in important variables. The average age was 68 years; 28 percent were women; and the distributions of stenosis severity, qualifying events, and comorbidities were similar between the two groups.

The two criteria for inclusion in the study were serious neurologic or ocular symptoms within the previous 180 days, and at least 70 percent stenosis in the ipsilateral carotid artery on duplex ultrasonography. Patients assigned to stenting had to be given 100 mg aspirin plus 75 mg clopidogrel daily for at least three days before and for 30 days after the procedure. Those allocated to endarterectomy had to be given at least 100 mg aspirin before, during, and after surgery. Results: Of the 605 patients assigned to stenting, 567 received the treatment. In the endarterectomy group, 565 of 595 patients underwent the procedure. Within 30 days of stenting, the rate of stroke or death was 6. 84 percent compared with
6. 34 percent following endarterectomy. editor's note: A study conducted in U. S. veterans also reported no significant differences between conventional endarterectomy and stenting.

1 The study compared 46 stent and 48 endarterectomy patients for outcomes including progression to critical restenosis, repeat surgeries, subsequent symptoms or stroke, and mortality. The researchers also reported equivalent changes in carotid artery velocity for up to 24 months of follow-up. — A. D. W.

### Transient ischemic attack: part II. risk factor modification… [^112w2gva]. AAFP (2012). Low credibility.

ANTIPLATELET AGENTS Antiplatelet agents are recommended for patients with a history of noncardioembolic TIA or stroke for the prevention of subsequent stroke. According to AHA/ASA guidelines, aspirin, extended-release dipyridamole/aspirin, and clopidogrel are acceptable first-line agents. 1 Aspirin is the most commonly used antiplatelet agent, and has been shown to be effective in the prevention of stroke for those with a history of TIA. 8, 40 The European Stroke Prevention Study 2 compared aspirin, dipyridamole, and their combination for the prevention of stroke. Patients with a history of TIA or stroke who were given aspirin had an RRR of 18 percent for subsequent stroke and of 22 percent for subsequent TIA. 8 The balance between effectiveness and safety of aspirin is optimized at 81 mg daily.
41.

Multiple studies, including the European Stroke Prevention Study 2, have shown that adding extended-release dipyridamole to aspirin leads to a further decrease in recurrent cerebral ischemic events, with an absolute risk reduction of
5. 9 percent compared with placebo. Given the equivalence of antiplatelet agents in the prevention of stroke following TIA, choice of agent should be individualized based on patient risk and clinical profiles, cost consideration, and adverse effects. 1 Using clopidogrel with aspirin is not recommended for stroke prevention because of bleeding risk, unless there is another indication for the regimen, such as cardiac stents or recent myocardial infarction.
1. For patients who have had a TIA or ischemic stroke within the past six months and have ipsilateral stenosis, carotid endarterectomy is recommended if stenosis is 70 to 99 percent and perioperative morbidity and mortality are estimated to be less than 6 percent.

1 If stenosis is 50 to 69 percent and morbidity and mortality are estimated to be less than 6 percent, carotid endarterectomy is recommended depending on patient-specific factors. 1 No intervention is indicated if stenosis is less than 50 percent. Carotid artery stenting may be considered as an alternative under certain circumstances. 1.

Key Points for Practice
- Prophylactic carotid endarterectomy for stroke prevention can be performed in highly selected patients with asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis, and in patients with a history of transient ischemic attack or stroke when perioperative risk is low.
- Aspirin therapy is reasonable in women with diabetes or in those 65 years and older if their blood pressure is controlled and the benefit for ischemic stroke and myocardial infarction prevention is likely to outweigh the risks. The following recommendations are based on data derived from multiple randomized clinical trials or meta-analyses. Prophylactic carotid endarterectomy performed with less than 3% of morbidity and mortality can be useful in highly selected patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis.

This procedure can be recommended in women with a recent transient ischemic attack or ischemic stroke and ipsilateral severe carotid stenosis if the estimated perioperative morbidity and mortality risk is less than 6%. The following recommendations are based on data derived from a single randomized trial or nonrandomized studies. Depending on patient factors such as age and comorbidities, carotid endarterectomy can be recommended in women with a recent transient ischemic attack or ischemic stroke and ipsilateral moderate carotid stenosis if the estimated perioperative morbidity and mortality risk is less than 6%. If indicated, it is reasonable for the surgery to take place within two weeks in women with no contraindications to early revascularization. Aspirin therapy is reasonable in women with diabetes and no contraindications.

It can also be useful in women 65 years and older if their blood pressure is controlled and the benefit for ischemic stroke and myocardial infarction prevention is likely to outweigh the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding and hemorrhagic stroke. The following recommendations are based on consensus opinion of experts, case studies, or standard of care. Women with asymptomatic carotid stenosis should be screened for other treatable risk factors, and lifestyle modifications should be initiated. Because aspirin was used in all major trials that demonstrated effectiveness, it should be used in women undergoing carotid endarterectomy who do not have contraindications.

### AHA updates guidelines for carotid endarterectomy… [^1157dyjt]. AAFP (1998). Low credibility.

The American Heart Association has updated guidelines for carotid endarterectomy in patients with symptomatic and asymptomatic carotid stenosis. Developed by the 16-member Special Writing Group of the Stroke Council, the guidelines cover the following topics: management of risk factors, such as hypertension, cigarette smoking, serum lipid levels, alcohol consumption, postmenopausal estrogen use and antiplatelet therapy; treatment of asymptomatic and symptomatic carotid stenosis; and complications of surgery. Antiplatelet Therapy. The guidelines point to data showing that antiplatelet therapy reduces the risk of stroke and other vascular events in high-risk patients. While the panel noted that the role of antiplatelet therapy in reducing the perioperative and postoperative risk of stroke is unresolved, aspirin therapy before carotid endarterectomy is recommended in the absence of contraindications.

The optimal dose of aspirin is not known. A summary of the panel's position follows: For patients with a surgical risk of less than 3 percent and a life expectancy of at least five years: proven indications — ipsilateral carotid endarterectomy for stenosis of 60 percent or more, with or without ulceration and antiplatelet therapy. For this surgical risk category, the recommendations also describe two proven inappropriate indications — ipsilateral carotid endarterectomy for stenosis of 75 percent or more or for stenosis of 50 percent or less, with or without ulceration and regardless of the contralateral internal carotid artery status. Symptomatic Carotid Stenosis According to the guidelines, three clinical trials of carotid endarterectomy demonstrate that the procedure improves the outcome in symptomatic patients with severe carotid stenosis. The European Carotid Surgery Trial revealed that the risk of ipsilateral stroke and perioperative death was 10.

3 percent in patients who underwent surgery and
16. 8 percent in patients who did not undergo surgery. The incidence of major or fatal ipsilateral stroke was 2. 5 percent in the surgically treated group and
13. 1 percent in the medically treated group. The NASCET investigators concluded that carotid endarterectomy is highly beneficial in patients with severe ipsilateral carotid stenosis and recent hemispheric ischemia or retinal transient ischemia. Data from ECST do not support surgical intervention in patients with less than 50 percent stenosis. NASCET data for this subgroup are not yet available.
