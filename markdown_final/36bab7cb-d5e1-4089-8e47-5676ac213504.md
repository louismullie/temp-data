## Question

Tell me about rhogam and pregnancy

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about RhoGAM (anti-D immunoglobulin) use in pregnancy, including mechanism, timing, dosing, special scenarios, controversies, and practical implementation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology and mechanism of action. Then, I should verify the baseline risk of Rh sensitization and the historical impact of prophylaxis. Next, I will review standard antenatal and postpartum protocols, followed by early pregnancy indications and dosing. After that, I need to examine special situations like ectopic pregnancy, trauma, and invasive procedures. I will then consider emerging strategies such as cell-free DNA fetal Rh typing and supply constraints. Finally, I should synthesize a practical, guideline-concordant approach and highlight knowledge gaps and quality improvement needs, making sure to double-check conflicting recommendations and correct any misstatements as I go.

> Let me first confirm the pathophysiology and mechanism. Rh sensitization occurs when an Rh-negative mother carries an Rh-positive fetus and fetomaternal hemorrhage exposes maternal immune cells to fetal RhD antigen, triggering anti-D production; subsequent pregnancies with Rh-positive fetuses are at risk for hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn due to transplacental maternal IgG anti-D causing fetal hemolysis, hydrops, and neurologic injury, so prevention hinges on neutralizing fetal RhD before maternal sensitization occurs [^1168f48U] [^11759EK5]. Wait, let me verify the mechanism of anti-D immunoglobulin itself; passive anti-D likely works via multiple pathways, including FcγRIIb-mediated inhibition of B cells and clearance of RhD-positive fetal cells, though the exact immunologic mechanism remains incompletely defined and may involve both Fc-dependent and independent effects, which still supports its clinical efficacy despite mechanistic uncertainty [^1168f48U].

> I should confirm baseline risk and the magnitude of benefit from prophylaxis. Historically, without prophylaxis, sensitization occurred in about 16% of Rh-negative pregnancies, with postpartum anti-D reducing this to roughly 1.5% and routine antenatal administration at 28 weeks further lowering it to approximately 0.2–0.5%, which is why universal antenatal prophylaxis is standard in many high-income settings [^112DjMDQ] [^111L8NxV]. Hold on, I should verify the antenatal evidence quality; the Cochrane review found low-certainty evidence for antenatal anti-D but did show fewer positive Kleihauer tests and a signal toward reduced sensitization, and bias-adjusted meta-analyses suggest a meaningful reduction in sensitization, which aligns with population-level effectiveness despite the limited RCT data [^111xqPTY] [^116SYuPv].

> Next, I should review the standard antenatal and postpartum protocol. Universal administration of 300 mcg (1500 IU) anti-D at 28 weeks' gestation is recommended, with repeat antibody screening at 24–28 weeks to detect alloimmunization, and a second 300 mcg dose within 72 hours postpartum if the neonate is Rh-positive; some programs use two smaller doses at 28 and 32–34 weeks, but a single 1500 IU dose appears to minimize detectable maternal anti-D at delivery and is widely adopted [^114LN6hS] [^116SYuPv]. I need to ensure I note the 72-hour window for postpartum dosing and the principle that larger fetomaternal hemorrhages may require additional vials guided by Kleihauer–Betke testing, which I will detail shortly [^112DjMDQ].

> Now, early pregnancy indications are where controversy lies, so I should double-check the evidence and guideline divergence. For spontaneous or induced abortion before 12 weeks, several contemporary guidelines advise that routine anti-D is not necessary because fetomaternal hemorrhage is below the calculated sensitization threshold and the absolute risk is very low; the Society of Family Planning, French CNGOF, and WHO-aligned positions support forgoing anti-D before 12 weeks, whereas ACOG still recommends considering it, particularly with surgical management or later first-trimester events, reflecting limited but evolving evidence [^111mfeg9] [^114mMfsZ] [^116zzg9t] [^1133Ewk1] [^115rRmtV]. Wait, let me verify the Cochrane conclusion; the 2013 review found insufficient data to support or refute anti-D after spontaneous miscarriage, reinforcing that practice should be individualized and guideline-dependent until higher-quality data emerge [^113cKwTi].

> I will now examine dosing in early pregnancy when anti-D is used. For events at or before 12 weeks, a 50 mcg dose is generally sufficient to cover the small expected fetomaternal hemorrhage; for 13–18 weeks, 100 mcg is advised; and beyond 18 weeks, the standard 300 mcg dose is used, with the principle that if the recommended dose is unavailable, a larger dose can be given without harm, though cost and supply implications should be considered [^1178DLWt] [^111M1Wpe]. Hold on, I should verify the timing; administration within 72 hours is ideal, and although some efficacy may persist beyond this window, delays should be minimized when feasible [^116YTR9u].

> Let me consider special situations, starting with ectopic pregnancy. ACOG recommends anti-D for Rh-negative patients with ectopic pregnancy, and RCOG advises offering anti-D when ectopic pregnancy is surgically managed or when bleeding is repeated or heavy; however, the French guideline found insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for ectopic pregnancy specifically, so shared decision-making is reasonable when evidence is limited [^1113zv9B] [^115AUi7a] [^114mMfsZ]. I should confirm that many clinicians still administer 50 mcg in this setting given low risk and potential benefit, aligning with ACOG's stance despite the evidence gap [^1178DLWt].

> Next, I should review abdominal trauma and other sensitizing events. Minor trauma can cause fetomaternal hemorrhage in a substantial minority of cases, so guidelines advise considering anti-D after trauma even when injuries appear minor; similarly, invasive procedures such as amniocentesis, chorionic villus sampling, or external cephalic version warrant anti-D, with dose adjusted to estimated hemorrhage volume using Kleihauer–Betke testing when large hemorrhage is suspected [^112gDnAv] [^111Wm5q2]. Wait, let me verify dosing escalation; each 300 mcg vial neutralizes about 30 mL of Rh-positive whole blood, so multiple vials are indicated when Kleihauer suggests greater than 15 mL fetal blood in maternal circulation, with repeat testing to document clearance in selected cases [^112DjMDQ] [^112i3Y6L].

> I need to check invasive procedures and second/third-trimester events. For procedures beyond 12 weeks, 300 mcg is standard, and if antepartum prophylaxis has been given, a postpartum dose is still indicated if the infant is Rh-positive; if delivery occurs within three weeks of the last antepartum dose, postpartum dosing may be withheld only if a fetal–maternal hemorrhage test is performed and is negative, to avoid overtreatment [^112i3Y6L]. Hold on, I should verify the maintenance principle; if anti-D is given very early and the pregnancy continues, repeat dosing every 12 weeks helps sustain protective anti-D levels, though this is rarely needed outside specialized contexts [^115LAAMq].

> Let me now examine emerging strategies and system-level issues. Cell-free DNA fetal RhD typing from maternal blood is highly accurate and increasingly available, enabling selective anti-D administration only to those carrying Rh-positive fetuses; this can reduce unnecessary injections by about 40% and mitigate supply constraints, though implementation depends on local access and cost-effectiveness considerations [^112nVCHf] [^115rCcrn]. I should confirm supply realities; RhoGAM is a human plasma-derived product with periodic shortages, reinforcing the value of targeted prophylaxis and stewardship, especially in early pregnancy where benefit is uncertain [^111M1Wpe] [^111L8NxV].

> But wait, what about safety and rare adverse events. Anti-D is generally very safe, but rare hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported; investigation is complicated in pregnancy, and careful history, skin testing, and, when necessary, fetal genotyping can guide safe re-exposure strategies to avoid inappropriate avoidance of life-saving prophylaxis [^1117dXu7]. I should double-check that no increased fetal risk has been demonstrated with appropriately indicated antenatal anti-D, supporting its favorable risk–benefit profile in standard protocols [^112i3Y6L].

> I will now synthesize a practical approach while acknowledging controversies. For all Rh-negative pregnant patients, obtain initial blood type and antibody screen, administer 300 mcg at 28 weeks, repeat antibody testing at 24–28 weeks, and give 300 mcg postpartum within 72 hours if the neonate is Rh-positive; for early pregnancy loss or abortion under 12 weeks, consider withholding anti-D unless surgical management is planned or the event occurs near 12 weeks, using shared decision-making and local guideline alignment; for ectopic pregnancy, favor giving anti-D when managed surgically or with significant bleeding; after trauma or invasive procedures, administer anti-D and escalate dosing based on Kleihauer when indicated [^114LN6hS] [^111mfeg9] [^1113zv9B] [^112gDnAv]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially implied that ACOG uniformly recommends anti-D for all first-trimester losses; I should correct that to "consider", particularly for surgical management or later first-trimester events, reflecting their more cautious stance amid limited evidence [^1133Ewk1] [^115rRmtV].

> Finally, I should review knowledge gaps and quality improvement needs. Evidence for anti-D in the first trimester remains limited and of low quality, contributing to divergent guidelines; systems-level failures such as missed or late administration still occur, and targeted education, checklists, and communication tools can reduce errors; further research should prioritize high-quality RCTs or large prospective cohorts to clarify early-pregnancy indications, cost-effectiveness, and the impact of cfDNA-guided selective prophylaxis on sensitization rates and equity of access [^113cKwTi] [^1166BA7o] [^113NzwwN]. Hold on, I should verify that international bodies continue to call for improved uptake where prophylaxis remains underutilized, as Rh disease burden remains substantial globally despite proven interventions, underscoring the need for both evidence refinement and implementation science [^111Wm5q2] [^113rq7Fw].

Rhogam (anti-D immunoglobulin) prevents **Rh sensitization** in Rh-negative mothers carrying Rh-positive fetuses, reducing the risk of hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn (HDFN) in current and future pregnancies [^112DjMDQ]. It is given at **28 weeks** [^114LN6hS] and within 72 hours after delivery if the infant is Rh-positive [^112DjMDQ]; additional doses are indicated after events with fetomaternal hemorrhage (e.g. miscarriage, trauma, invasive procedures) [^112i3Y6L]. Early pregnancy (< 12 weeks) has minimal risk of sensitization, so routine Rhogam is not universally required, though some guidelines advise shared decision-making for losses after 10–12 weeks [^111mfeg9] [^113ns9xg]. Rhogam is safe, with rare allergic reactions, and is essential for preventing HDFN-related morbidity and mortality [^112mn7LZ] [^111L8NxV].

---

## Indications for RhoGAM administration

Rhogam is indicated for **Rh-negative pregnant women** in the following scenarios:

- **Routine antenatal prophylaxis**: Administer at 28 weeks gestation to prevent sensitization from asymptomatic fetomaternal hemorrhage [^114LN6hS] [^116SYuPv].

- **Postpartum prophylaxis**: Within 72 hours after delivery if the newborn is Rh-positive [^112DjMDQ].

- **Miscarriage or abortion**: After spontaneous or induced abortion, especially after 10–12 weeks gestation, due to potential fetomaternal hemorrhage [^111mfeg9] [^113ns9xg].

- **Ectopic pregnancy**: Recommended after surgical management or significant bleeding [^115AUi7a] [^1113zv9B].

- **Trauma or invasive procedures**: After abdominal trauma, amniocentesis, chorionic villus sampling, or external cephalic version, due to increased risk of fetomaternal hemorrhage [^111iAx2u].

---

## Timing and dosing of RhoGAM

The timing and dosing of RhoGAM vary by **clinical scenario**:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Timing** | **Dose** |
|-|-|-|
| Routine antenatal prophylaxis | 28 weeks gestation | 300 mcg (1500 IU) |
| Postpartum prophylaxis | Within 72 hours after delivery | 300 mcg (1500 IU) |
| Miscarriage or abortion < 12 weeks | Within 72 hours | 50 mcg (250 IU) |
| Miscarriage or abortion ≥ 12 weeks | Within 72 hours | 300 mcg (1500 IU) |
| Ectopic pregnancy | Within 72 hours | 50–300 mcg (250–1500 IU) |
| Trauma or invasive procedures | Within 72 hours | 300 mcg (1500 IU) |

---

Additional doses are indicated when fetomaternal hemorrhage exceeds 15 mL, as determined by **Kleihauer-Betke testing** [^112DjMDQ] [^112i3Y6L].

---

## Risks and side effects

Rhogam is **generally safe**, with minimal risks:

- **Allergic reactions**: Rare, including anaphylaxis, but serious reactions are uncommon [^112mn7LZ].

- **Local reactions**: Mild soreness or redness at injection site.

- **Theoretical infection risk**: As a blood product, there is a minimal risk of infectious disease transmission, though modern screening significantly reduces this risk [^111M1Wpe].

---

## Consequences of not receiving Rhogam

Failure to administer Rhogam when indicated can lead to **Rh sensitization**, whereby the mother develops anti-D antibodies that cross the placenta and cause HDFN in subsequent Rh-positive pregnancies. HDFN can cause severe fetal anemia, jaundice, organ damage, or death [^111XQJiJ].

---

## Current clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines emphasize **routine antenatal prophylaxis** at 28 weeks and postpartum administration when the infant is Rh-positive [^114LN6hS]. For early pregnancy (< 12 weeks), routine RhoGAM is not universally required due to minimal risk of sensitization, though some guidelines recommend shared decision-making for losses after 10–12 weeks [^111mfeg9] [^113ns9xg]. RhoGAM is also recommended after ectopic pregnancy, trauma, or invasive procedures due to increased risk of fetomaternal hemorrhage [^1113zv9B] [^112gDnAv] [^111FVYRi].

---

## Special considerations

- **Multiple gestations**: RhoGAM is indicated for Rh-negative mothers carrying multiples, as the risk of sensitization increases with multiple fetuses.

- **Previous sensitization**: RhoGAM is not effective if the mother is already sensitized; in such cases, specialized maternal-fetal care is required.

- **Alternative therapies**: There are no effective alternatives to RhoGAM for preventing Rh sensitization.

---

Rhogam is a **critical intervention** for preventing Rh sensitization and HDFN in Rh-negative pregnant women. It is safe, effective, and recommended at 28 weeks gestation, postpartum, and after specific events with fetomaternal hemorrhage.

### Do Rh-negative women with first trimester spontaneous abortions need Rh immune globulin? [^112oNp3u]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine whether literature supports the use of Rh immune globulin in Rh-negative women with first trimester spontaneous abortions to prevent maternal sensitization to the fetal Rh antigen and subsequent fetal morbidity and mortality.

Methods

We searched MEDLINE (1966–2005), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, EMBASE (1990 to 2005), and the reference sections of the articles found. The search is considered updated to December of 2005. Search terms included vaginal bleeding, Rh negative, Rh immune globulin, RhoGAM, isoimmunization, sensitization, first trimester pregnancy, threatened, and spontaneous abortion.

Results

The evidence to support the use of Rh immune globulin for a diagnosis of first trimester spontaneous abortion is minimal. There is a paucity of well-designed research that examines maternal sensitization or hemolytic disease of the newborn as an outcome in patients receiving, versus not receiving, Rh immune globulin in first trimester bleeding. There is significant evidence to demonstrate fetomaternal hemorrhage in first trimester spontaneous abortions; yet, no studies demonstrate subsequent maternal sensitization or development hemolytic disease in the fetus as a result of this hemorrhage.

Conclusion

In summary, there is minimal evidence that administering Rh immune globulin for first trimester vaginal bleeding prevents maternal sensitization or development of hemolytic disease of the newborn. The practice of administering Rh immune globulin to Rh-negative women with a first trimester spontaneous abortion is based on expert opinion and extrapolation from experience with fetomaternal hemorrhage in late pregnancy. Its use for first trimester bleeding is not evidence-based.

### Appropriate provision of anti-D prophylaxis to RhD negative pregnant women: a scoping review [^112Ltfe1]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2014). Low credibility.

Methods

A scoping review framework was chosen because it is an exploratory process, enabling the team to determine the depth, range, and nature of the research that exists, thereby not limiting to specific types of research methodology and critical analysis. This review followed Levac et al's scoping review framework: identify the research question, identify relevant studies, select the studies, chart the data, summarize and report the results, and consult with knowledge users. Ethics was not required because this review methodology was not experimental research nor did it involve human participants.

Data sources

The following databases were searched by a librarian: CINAHL (EBSCO), EBM Reviews (OvidSP), Embase (OvidSP), Medline (OvidSP), and Web of Science (ISI). In addition to database searching the librarian hand searched reference lists of potential articles to include. To ensure rigor, the librarian had the database search strategy peer reviewed by another librarian. This process reduced the likelihood of human based search error.

The following search terms were used: Rho(D) Immune Globulin, immunoglobulins, anti-idiotypic antibodies, anti-D immunoglobulin, anti-D immune globulin, anti-D prophylaxis, anti-D immunoprophylaxis, Rhogam, Winrho, pregnancy, pregnant women, Rh alloimmunization, Rh sensitization, Rh isoimmunization, Rh incompatibility, rhesus disease, blood group incompatibility, hospitalists, family physicians, emergency physicians, obstetricians, nurse practitioners, midwifery, nurse midwives, hospital emergency service, emergency department, acute care, obstetrics and gynecology department, primary care, outposts, ambulatory care facilities, hospital units, or birthing centres. Medical subject headings were used when available and deemed appropriate. Keyword searching utilized truncation and alternative spelling.

### Society of Family Planning committee consensus on Rh testing in early pregnancy [^116YTR9u]. Contraception (2022). High credibility.

Rh immunoglobulin product, timing, and dosing intervals — Rh immunoglobulin is an antibody derived from pooled human plasma extracted from Rh-negative individuals who were born male and have been immunized to the RhO(D) antigen through exposure to the Rh-positive blood, and its mechanism in Rh-negative pregnant individuals is not completely understood but is dose dependent with optimal dosing as close as possible to exposure. Initial studies used a 72hour window due to a study design that did not include weekend visits, although some efficacy is believed to continue even weeks after the bleeding event, and monoclonal extract is not effective and synthetic Rh immunoglobulin is not clinically available. Detection of passive anti-D after administration is dose dependent, and to maintain passively acquired anti-D after repeated events that may lead to fetomaternal hemorrhage and sensitization, we recommend a dosing interval corresponding to dose volume: per event for 50 mcg, 6 weeks for 100 mcg, and 12 weeks for 300 mcg.

### Rhesus isoimmunisation in unsensitised RhD-negative individuals seeking abortion at less than 12 weeks' gestation: a systematic review [^116FCY4K]. BMJ Sexual & Reproductive Health (2022). High credibility.

The second included study was published in 1972 and followed 170 RhD-negative postabortion patients for 6 months or more with antibody titre testing. The primary aim of this study was to identify Rh sensitisation after an abortion in those who did and did not receive RhoGAM. There was no clear description of data collection duration. For example, patients were followed for different times depending on their antibody status. All postabortion participants were observed for 6 months with antibody titres performed at 6 weeks, 3 months and 6 months. In sensitised participants with antibodies detected at 3 months, repeat follow-up serology was performed 24 months after abortion. The study followed patients identified as RhD-negative mothers without antibodies in their blood and a negative Coombs test. When possible, a husband's ABO blood group was also determined. There were 48 in the intervention group, receiving an injection of RhoGAM, and 122 in the control group. The main outcome was incidence of rhesus sensitisation in a period of 6 months or more postabortion in RhD-negative mothers. The study identified five mothers who became sensitised in the control group. There were no sensitisations found in the intervention group. The authors of this review assessed the limitations of the study and its quality which included: patients not randomised (patients were placed in the control group if RhoGAM was not available), lack of allocation concealment, lack of reported follow-up rate, no sample size or power calculation. The study did not identify sensitised patients within the intervention group.

### New developments in fetal and neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia [^116YehU6]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). Medium credibility.

Fetal and neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia, the platelet equivalent of hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn, can have devastating effects on both the fetus and neonate. Current management of fetal and neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia in a subsequent affected pregnancy involves antenatal administration of intravenous immune globulin and prednisone to the pregnant woman to prevent the development of severe fetal thrombocytopenia and secondary intracranial hemorrhage in utero. That therapy has proven to be highly effective but is associated with maternal side effects and is expensive. This commentary describes 4 advances that could substantially change the current approach to detecting and managing fetal and neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia in the near future. The first would be an introduction of a program to screen all antepartum patients in this country for pregnancies at risk of developing fetal and neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia. Strategies to implement this complex process have been described. A second advance is testing of cell-free fetal DNA obtained from maternal blood to noninvasively determine the fetal human platelet antigen 1 genotype. A third, in preliminary development, is creation of a prophylactic product that would be the platelet equivalent of Rh immune globulin (RhoGAM). Finally, a fourth major potential advance is the development of neonatal Fc receptor inhibitors to replace the current medical therapy administered to pregnant women with an affected fetus. Neonatal Fc receptor recycles plasma immunoglobulin G to increase its half-life and is the means by which immunoglobulin G crosses the placenta from the maternal to the fetal circulation. Blocking the neonatal Fc receptor is an ideal way to prevent maternal immunoglobulin G antibody from causing fetal and neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia in a fetus at risk of developing that disorder. The pertinent pathophysiology and rationale for each of these developments will be presented in addition to our thoughts relating to steps that must be taken and difficulties that each approach would face for them to be successfully implemented.

### Society of Family Planning committee consensus on Rh testing in early pregnancy [^117TGhu4]. Contraception (2022). High credibility.

Existing recommendations for Rh immunoglobulin after miscarriage are summarized from a cited review. The text notes a "2013 Cochrane review assessing the effects of Rh immunoglobulin administration among patients undergoing spontaneous abortion (miscarriage) between 8 to 24 weeks gestation" that concluded there is "Insufficient data to evaluate the practice of anti-D administration in an unsensitised Rh-negative mother after spontaneous miscarriage".

### Rhesus isoimmunisation in unsensitised RhD-negative individuals seeking abortion at less than 12 weeks' gestation: a systematic review [^114K3K4U]. BMJ Sexual & Reproductive Health (2022). High credibility.

Results

The search strategy identified 2652 publications and three duplicate records were removed, leaving 2649 publications for abstract screening (figure 1). From abstract screening, 105 publications underwent full-text review. The two included studies were cohort studies taking place in the United States and Israel. Both studies included women with induced abortion in addition to other types of abortion.

Figure 1
PRISMA flow diagram.

A 1972 study funded by Ortho Research Foundation and the Kaiser Foundation Hospital performed a prospective double-blind study collecting data on 491 women undergoing therapeutic abortions between 1 November 1969 and 15 August 1970 in California. The primary aim of this study was to investigate Rh immunisation incidence in a postabortion period of 6 months or more in RhD-negative people. From the 491 therapeutic abortion patients, and 180 spontaneous abortion patients, 57 were RhD-negative based on indirect Coombs at the time of abortion management. The resulting sample size was 44 because three refused participation, nine were lost to follow-up and one husband was found to also be RhD-negative (paternal genotyping was only performed in 50% of couples). Within 72 hours of abortion the patient received RhoGAM or a placebo. The study found two of 36 sensitisations in the placebo group with indirect Coombs positive after abortion. All patients receiving RhoGAM were not found to be sensitised. Despite a 'double-blind' approach there was no description of allocation concealment, therefore the authors of this review considered this an impact on study quality. However, the objective measurement of outcome (titres) is a strength of the study. Other factors contributing to the limitations of the study and its quality include: no description of allocation, no follow-up rate reported for patients, no defined sample size, no power calculations for sample size, no intention to treat analysis and no report of a 'Table 1' for the demographics of the population studied.

### The use of free DNA for fetal RHD genotyping in the Rh negative pregnant patient-the time has come [^112nVCHf]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2025). Medium credibility.

Cell-free DNA to determine the fetal RHD genotype from the maternal circulation was first described in 1993. High throughput assays using polymerase chain reaction technology were introduced in Europe and gained widespread acceptance in the management of the Rhesus alloimmunized pregnancy. The specificity and sensitivity of these assays approached 99%. As confidence was gained with these results, Scandinavian countries began to employ cell-free DNA for fetal RHD typing as an integral component of their introduction of antenatal Rhesus immune globulin in non-alloimmunized pregnancies. Since 40% of RhD-negative pregnant women will carry an RhD-negative fetus, doses of Rhesus immune globulin were conserved. Recently 2 U.S. companies have introduced cell-free DNA assays for RHD as part of their noninvasive prenatal testing assays. Both utilize next generation sequencing and have developed methodologies to detect the aberrant RHD pseudogene and the hybrid RHD-CE-D s genotype. In addition, excellent correlation studies with either neonatal genotyping or serology have been reported. The manufacturer of RhoGAM has recently announced a national shortage. Given the current availability of reliable cell-free DNA assays for determining the RHD status of the fetus, the time has come to implement this strategy to triage the antenatal use of Rhesus immune globulin in the U.S.

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the initial evaluation and management of patients presenting to the emergency department in early pregnancy [^116CqYTz]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Rh seroconversion and indications for anti-D immunoglobulin — The policy asks, "Is the administration of anti-D immunoglobulin indicated among Rh-negative women during the first trimester of pregnancy with threatened abortion, complete abortion, ectopic pregnancy, or minor abdominal trauma?" and notes that data are limited, the conclusion is based on a rational theoretical construct and limited observational studies rather than on prospective or experimental studies, and that the strength of that conclusion varies somewhat with the individual entity being considered.

### A case of massive fetal-maternal hemorrhage: lessons learned in diagnosis and treatment [^114LQkKV]. Laboratory Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

The use of Rho(D) immune globulin in Rh-negative pregnant women has become standard of care, but many practicing clinicians do not know the dosing recommendations for this essential medication. In this article, we describe a case of a 15-year-old girl who presented with intrauterine fetal demise and was found to have massive fetomaternal hemorrhage. Kleihauer-Betke testing results indicated nearly 460 mL of fetal blood in the maternal circulation. The patient ultimately received 4800 µg of Rho(D) immune globulin, a dose that required close coordination with the obstetrical service and pharmacy. Although this is an unusual case of large-volume, potentially chronic, fetomaternal hemorrhage, it is also an excellent illustration of the principles for diagnosing this condition, as well as providing dosing guidelines for Rho(D) immunoglobulin to prevent alloimmunization.

### Society of Family Planning committee consensus on Rh testing in early pregnancy [^111M1Wpe]. Contraception (2022). High credibility.

Rh immunoglobulin costs, dosing, and supply considerations are detailed as follows. "The wholesale cost per 300mcg dose in the US is approximately $80", and "Although the smaller 50mcg dose is considered sufficient to prevent sensitization in early pregnancy, many health systems universally administer the 300mcg dose". The product "is a human blood product, dependent on donors and subject to those attendant risks", and while "The current supply is screened for known pathogens and very safe", "Global shortages have occurred in the past" and "a new bloodborne pathogen may not be immediately detectable in the future".

Society of Family Planning — minimum Rh immunoglobulin dosing by gestational age is specified as follows: for < 12 wk, "No administration recommended routinely for spontaneous or induced abortion. 50 mcg/ 250 IU for ectopic pregnancy, sharp curettage, or other invasive procedures"; for 13 to < 18 wk the minimum dose is "100mcg/ 500 IU dose"; for > 18 wk the minimum dose is "300mcg/ 1500 IU dose". If the recommended dose is unavailable, a larger dose can be given, and "At > 12 wk, Rh immunoglobulin should only be given to patients who are outside the window of efficacy of any previous administration".

The introduction of anti-Rh(D) immunoglobulin more than 50 years ago has resulted in only a 50% decrease in Rhesus disease globally owing to a low uptake of this prophylactic approach. The International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics, International Confederation of Midwives, and Worldwide Initiative for Rhesus Disease Eradication have reviewed current evidence regarding the utility of anti-Rh(D) immunoglobulin. Taking into account the effectiveness anti-Rh(D), the new guidelines propose adjusting the dose for different indications and prioritizing its administration by indication.

Regarding the use of rho(D) immune globulin IM (also known as HyperRHO S/D) in pregnant patients for all trimesters: use only if benefits outweigh potential risks. Although Rh0 [D] immune globulin has not been well studied in pregnant women and animal reproduction studies have not been conducted, some of the products are routinely given during pregnancy. Under ideal circumstances, when used to prevent Rh0 [D] isoimmunization from exposure to Rh0[D]-positive blood, Rh0 [D] immune globulin should only be administered to a non-sensitized Rh0 [D]-negative obstetric patient. If there is question about the mother's Rh type or if there is insufficient time to determine fetal Rh typing (as might occur in trauma during pregnancy), then Rh0 [D] immune globulin should be administered as indicated by the clinical situation. Rh0 [D] immune globulin would not be effective in preventing erythroblastosis fetalis in the Rh0 [D]-negative mother who has already formed anti-D IgG antibodies. However, Rh0 [D] negative women who have already been sensitized to the Rh0 [D] erythrocyte factor do not appear to have an increase in adverse reactions if administered the product as a result of unknown Rh status. There is no known obstetric indication for the use of Rh0 [D] immune globulin in women who are Rh0 [D]-positive, as these women are not at risk of isoimmunization from an Rh0 [D]-positive fetus.

### Society of Family Planning committee consensus on Rh testing in early pregnancy [^11716vAS]. Contraception (2022). High credibility.

Society of Family Planning committee consensus — Rh immunoglobulin in early pregnancy recommends providing Rh immunoglobulin only after 12 weeks gestation for spontaneous abortion or medication or aspiration abortion. Supporting evidence states that forgoing Rh immunoglobulin administration before 12weeks gestation is highly unlikely to increase risk of Rh (D) antibody development, fetal red blood cell (RBC) exposure during aspiration abortion < 12 weeks gestation is below the calculated threshold to cause maternal Rh sensitization, and the amount of fetomaternal hemorrhage during dilation and evacuation procedures up to 18weeks gestation is adequately treated with 100mcg of Rh immunoglobulin. Background context notes that even prior to the discovery of Rh immunoglobulin, only 9% to10% of pregnancies in Rh-negative patients led to sensitization, and giving Rh immunoglobulin at 28-weeks' gestation and again at delivery has decreased the rates of immunization from 10% to 0.2%.

Risks associated withimmune globulin administration

The risks associated with RhD immune globulin are low (viral and prion risks associated with injection of a blood‐derived product, hypersensitivity or allergies). It is a product of human origin, obtained primarily from healthy, hyperimmunized and compensated North American donors. Since 2005, only Rhophylac has been marketed in France in two doses, 200 μg and 300 μg, depending on the indication. There is a theoretical risk associated with prions, as well as a viral risk, which is low because of the treatments used to eliminate viruses, but the risk is not zero, particularly with regard to viruses that have not yet been identified. There is also a risk of allergy and hypersensitivity. A few cases of serious allergic reactions to other brands of RhD immune globulin have been reported in the literature. No allergic reactions have been reported in antenatal and postnatal efficacy studies of Rhophylac. Therefore, the risks associated with RhD immune globulin are very low but potentially serious.

Population potentially concerned byimmune globulin administration

Approximately 20%–25% of pregnant women will experience bleeding in the first trimester and will go to their doctor or gynecologic emergency room for diagnosis and management. The proportion of RhD negative individuals in the French population is approximately 15%. The administration of RhD immune globulin for first‐trimester bleeding therefore potentially affects approximately 30 000 women per year in France.

Overall, there is no evidence in the literature to support the efficacy of RhD immune globulin administration to prevent alloimmunization in the setting of first‐trimester bleeding in an ongoing pregnancy. Moreover, a recent multicenter prospective observational study shows that the risk of alloimmunization is low in cases of abortion before 12 WG and that there is no association between bleeding and an increased risk of alloimmunization. Finally, the risk of RhD immune globulin is not zero and the potentially affected population is large.

3.3 Question 3

In a patient who is RhD negative, when the progenitor is RhD positive or unknown, in case of ectopic pregnancy, does the injection of RhD immune globulin reduce the risk of alloimmunization? (Table S3).

### Rhesus isoimmunisation in unsensitised RhD-negative individuals seeking abortion at less than 12 weeks' gestation: a systematic review [^1156TdFQ]. BMJ Sexual & Reproductive Health (2022). High credibility.

Conclusions

Rh immunoglobulin has well-documented safety. However, it is not without associated risks and costs, and it introduces barriers to accessing care that may impact especially on populations with restricted access (ie, legal, financial or resource-wise). The evidence base and quality of studies are currently limited, but there is some reassurance and experience from several national guidelines to justify no longer requiring its use in the first trimester. There is unclear benefit from the recommendation for Rh testing and immunoglobulin administration in early pregnancy. Clinical practice guidelines are based on expert opinions which are varied and moving away from testing and administration at the time of abortion. Therefore, more robust research would help give the reassurance needed to achieve substantial changes to guide clinical practice.

4 ANTI‐RH(D) IMMUNOGLOBULIN ADMINISTRATION IN PREGNANCY

Most cases of Rh(D) sensitization occur as a result of labor. Routine prenatal administration of anti‐Rh(D) immunoglobulin to prevent sensitization resulting from fetal–maternal hemorrhage during pregnancy has been studied in a meta‐analysis of two randomized controlled trials. 12 These showed a 42% reduction in sensitization, although this reduction was not significant (95% confidence interval, 0.15–1.62). 12 However, a 'bias‐adjusted' meta‐analysis of data from 10 studies estimated a pooled odds ratio for a reduction in sensitization of 0.31 (95% CI, 0.17–0.56), which was highly significant. 13 Therefore, prenatal administration seems to reduce sensitization further, from approximately 1.5%, achieved by administration of postpartum anti‐Rh(D) immunoglobulin, to approximately 0.5%.

Prenatal anti‐Rh(D) immunoglobulin may be given intramuscularly or intravenously, with no clear difference in effectiveness. 14 It may be given once at 28–34 weeks of gestation (1500 IU), or twice at 28 and 32–34 weeks (625 IU or 1500 IU at each gestational age). Two recent meta‐analyses and an additional randomized controlled trial showed that a single administration of 1500 IU resulted in the lowest proportion of women with detectable circulating anti‐Rh(D) at delivery, suggesting that this is the optimal dose against sensitization during pregnancy. 11, 13, 15

ACOG Committee Statement No. 13 — self-managed abortion (SMA) clinical care and documentation — states that "the approach to caring for someone who is self-managing an abortion is the same as the management of spontaneous pregnancy loss", and that "Patients should be able to access routine pregnancy care, including ultrasonography as well as Rh status testing and Rhogam, as indicated". For patients presenting during or after SMA, "patients should be treated as any patient presenting for care for spontaneous pregnancy loss would be treated", and "Questions and evaluation should be based on the patient's presenting symptoms in the context of a recent pregnancy but do not need to delve into the circumstances that lead them to seek care"; "The patient should undergo routine evaluation to make sure that the individual is clinically stable and that the process has completed", and "There is not a clinical need for the health care professional to probe further to ask whether this is the result of an SMA". Regarding documentation and testing, clinicians are advised that "health care professionals should be aware that, if a patient voluntarily discloses an SMA, documenting and reporting the information can cause harm", to "consider how the information they request and subsequently document may be putting their patients and themselves at risk of criminalization", and that "It is recommended to document only information that is necessary for the ongoing care of a patient". The guidance adds that "Tests that may be part of a "routine" evaluation may not actually be necessary and could prove harmful; thus, it is important to approach an evaluation with the risk of criminalization in mind", that "Overall, health care professionals should be intentional about the information they seek from patients and whether that information is clinically necessary", and "They should not seek or document information that may put a patient at legal risk while not being clinically relevant to the care plan".

Historical evidence that fetal red blood cell (RBC) exposure during early spontaneous or induced abortion can cause maternal Rh sensitization is limited. A close reading of these studies indicates that forgoing Rh immunoglobulin administration before 12weeks gestation is highly unlikely to increase risk of Rh (D) antibody development, and recent studies indicate that fetal RBC exposure during aspiration abortion < 12 weeks gestation is below the calculated threshold to cause maternal Rh sensitization, and the amount of fetomaternal hemorrhage during dilation and evacuation procedures up to 18weeks gestation is adequately treated with 100mcg of Rh immunoglobulin. We provide updated recommendations for Rh immunoglobulin administration based on this new evidence.

1 INTRODUCTION

In 1968, more 50 years ago, anti‐Rh(D) immunoglobulin was approved for use among Rhesus (Rh)‐negative women to prevent sensitization to the Rh(D) blood group antigen after delivery. 1, 2 Subsequently, this approach was expanded to give anti‐Rh(D) prophylaxis during pregnancy to prevent sensitization in the third trimester, as well as anti‐D prophylaxis in the case of miscarriage, ectopic pregnancy, amniocentesis, bleeding or abdominal trauma during pregnancy, and/or external cephalic version for breech presentation. Recently in some countries, fetal Rh determination in maternal blood has been introduced in early pregnancy to prevent unnecessary immunoglobulin administration when the fetus seems to be Rh(D)‐negative. 3

This approach is highly effective and Rh disease has been more or less eradicated in most high‐income countries. Nevertheless, recent data have shown that, in approximately 50% of eligible cases worldwide, anti‐Rh(D) immunoglobulin is not administered. 4, 5 The reasons vary but include insufficient supply, cost considerations, ignorance (e.g. simply forgot to administer anti‐Rh[D]), lack of access, and use of products that have not been tested for therapeutic efficacy. 6 It has been estimated that Rh disease still results in more than 160 000 perinatal deaths and 100 000 cases of disability annually, representing only a 50% reduction relative to the era before immunoglobulin administration. 4 Such a high burden of a preventable disease should be considered completely unacceptable.

The aim of the present study was to summarize data on the prevention of Rh disease by immunoprophylaxis and provide guidelines that take into consideration the cost‐effectiveness of the different dose regimens and prioritize the administration of anti‐Rh(D) by indication. The guidelines are summarized in Box 1.

Table 1 — Recommendations for Rh testing and anti-D immunoglobulin administration for induced abortion — summarizes organization-specific guidance with gestational thresholds and exact directive language. For medication abortion at ≤ 70 d, ACOG/SFP state: "Rh testing is recommended in patients with unknown Rh status before medication abortion, and Rh immunoglobulin should be administered if indicated", with shared decision making if access would "significantly delay medication abortion". The National Abortion Federation (NAF) for < 12 wk states: "[I]t is reasonable to forgo Rh testing and immunoglobulin for women having any type of induced abortion before 12 wk from the last menstrual period". WHO at < 12 wk advises: "For both medical and surgical abortion at < 12 wk: Recommend against Rh immunoglobulin administration". RCOG for durations "over 12 wk" says: "A determination of Rhesus blood status may be considered… if anti-D is available". PPFA indicates "[No] requirement for Rh testing and Rh immunoglobulin administration for both medication and surgical abortion ≤ 77 d gestational age", while NICE advises providers should ensure "Rh status testing and Rh immunoglobulin supply does not cause any delays to women having an abortion".

### Society of Family Planning committee consensus on Rh testing in early pregnancy [^1169qMjF]. Contraception (2022). High credibility.

Rh testing and prophylaxis in early pregnancy — evidence and international practice indicate that forgoing Rh immunoglobulin before 12 weeks gestation does not increase the risk of Rh (D) antibody development, that fetal red blood cell (RBC) exposure during aspiration abortion less than 12 weeks gestation is below the calculated sensitization threshold, and that most abortion patients have detectable fetal RBCs before the procedure with uncertain clinical relevance. Additionally, fetomaternal hemorrhage during dilation and evacuation up to 18 weeks gestation is adequately treated with 100mcg of Rh immunoglobulin. Practice varies: in the Netherlands, neither Rh testing nor treatment is performed before 7 weeks' gestation for induced abortion or before 10 weeks' gestation for spontaneous abortion, whereas in Canada Rh-negative patients are routinely given Rh immunoglobulin at any gestational age for any bleeding; a 2019 binational analysis including 3.8 million patients did not find differences in diagnosed Rh sensitization rates between the two countries.

Anti-D immunoglobulin prophylaxis — evidence in Rh-negative patients — lacks randomized trials in pregnant women but shows benefits in observational and experimental data. "The straightforward answer is that no randomized clinical trials to answer that question have been done on pregnant Rh-negative women". In volunteers, "Rh-negative male volunteers were injected with Rh-positive blood, which resulted in 50% immunization". In a Canadian study "of 1,216 Rh-negative patients… receiving anti-D immunoglobulin, there were no cases of immunization at 6 months postpartum", compared with "a 7.3% immunization rate in patients refusing treatment". In a combined Liverpool and Baltimore trial, "58% of patients were treated with anti-D immunoglobulin immediately postpartum and 50% were not", and "The treated patients had a 90% decrease in alloimmunization… when tested at 6 months postpartum". Population-level programs show impact: in the United Kingdom, introduction of "a postpartum rhesus prevention program… in 1969 reduced fetal mortality… from 120 per 100,000 live births to 1.5 per 100,000 by 1989", and "Introduction of antenatal prophylaxis at 28 and/or 34 weeks' gestation reduced the immunization rate another 90%".

### Is Rh immune globulin needed in early first-trimester abortion? A review [^111UjM32]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2003). Low credibility.

The prophylactic use of Rh immune globulin has been a medical success, protecting women who could be at risk from exposure to the Rh(D) antigen. Thus, it is not surprising that Rh(D) immunoprophylaxis has been extended from women with term pregnancies to all women with miscarriages, abortions, and ectopic pregnancies. In this article we review the existing medical literature to assess the risks of fetomaternal hemorrhage and Rh isoimmunization after complications of a first-trimester pregnancy, induced abortion, or ectopic pregnancy. The evidence to support the use of Rh immune globulin in the first trimester is sparse, but there is theoretic evidence of its necessity. Despite weak evidence to support its use, there is little risk.

### Hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn and rhesus alloimmunization in latin American countries: a scoping review [^114wWCAZ]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The incidence, morbidity, and mortality of HDFN in the LATAM region are troublesome, and RhD alloimmunization is reported in up to approximately 70% of severe HDFN cases. Rh immunoglobulin immunoprophylaxis to prevent sensitization to the D antigen is the most impactful intervention to reduce severe cases of HDFN. For women with Rh alloimmunization or with alloimmunization to other antigens associated with poor outcomes, early identification of pregnancies at risk of severe HDFN, efficient prevention programs, and timely referral to reference centers can significantly reduce the burden of this condition. The findings from this review are a contribute to raise awareness and strengthen public healthcare policies on HDFN.

### Prevention of RhD alloimmunization in the first trimester of pregnancy: clinical practice guidelines of the French college of obstetricians and gynecologists [^114YUcZ4]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

The French College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has decided to update its clinical practices guidelines for preventing RhD alloimmunization in the first trimester of pregnancy. The quality of evidence of the literature was assessed following the GRADE methodology with questions formulated in the Patients, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome (PICO) format and outcomes defined a priori and classified according to their importance. An extensive bibliographic search was performed using Pubmed, Cochrane, EMBASE, and Google Scholar databases. The quality of evidence was assessed (high, moderate, low, very low) and a recommendation was formulated: strong, weak, or no recommendation. The recommendations were reviewed in two rounds by members of the scientific board of the French College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (Delphi survey) in order to select the consensus recommendations. The three recommendations from the PICO questions were agreed upon through the use of the Delphi method. It is not recommended to administer RhD immune globulin before 12weeks of gestation to reduce the risk of alloimmunization in the event of induced or spontaneous abortion in RhD-negative patients when the progenitor is RhD-positive or unknown (weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence). It is not recommended to administer RhD immune globulin before 12weeks of gestation to reduce the risk of alloimmunization in the event of bleeding (weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence). The quality and quantity of literature data are insufficient to determine whether injection of RhD immune globulin can reduce the risk of alloimmunization in ectopic pregnancy, so no recommendation could be made.

### Hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn and rhesus alloimmunization in latin American countries: a scoping review [^113dc6n1]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

We observed proportions between 22 and 34% of Rh alloimmunization among Rh-negative pregnant women. These higher proportions than those reported in other world regions can be explained by the fact that included studies were from reference centers in LATAM following more severe cases, but also by a lower uptake of Rh immunoprophylaxis in LATAM countries. A recent study estimated that post-partum immunoprophylaxis was fully adequate in 2 LATAM countries (i.e. 6% of that geographical region) while 22 countries (71% of LATAM region) had an uptake of post-partum immunoprophylaxis lower than 80%. In other world regions, routine postnatal administration of Rh immunoglobulin has significantly reduced the risk of maternal alloimmunization to about 1 to 3 in 1000 RhD-negative pregnant individuals. For instance, before routine antenatal anti-D prophylaxis, this was the third most common alloantibody in pregnancies in Iceland (12.5% of detected alloantibodies) and the incidence of RhD alloimmunization was 6.1 per 1000 births of RhD negative women. To avoid adverse perinatal outcomes, it is critical to reinforce the use of immunoprophylaxis for anti-D alloimmunization in pregnant individuals. Additionally, given the association of non-anti-D antibodies with the development of HDFN, it may be warranted to request an antibody screen (indirect antiglobulin test) for all pregnant individuals, even those who are D-positive, and direct antiglobulin test for newborns whose mothers have an alloantibody other than anti-D, to diagnose non-anti-D maternal alloimmunization. Better education for pregnant individuals who are Rh-negative during antenatal care may enhance adherence to prophylaxis and inform family planning.

3 RECOMMENDATIONS

After summarizing the work of the experts and applying the GRADE methodology, three recommendations were formalized. All recommendations were submitted to the expert group for evaluation using the GRADE method. After a first round of scoring, agreement was reached on 66.6% (2/3) of the recommendations. In the second round of scoring, agreement was reached on the third recommendation, which had been modified following comments made in the first round. For three questions, the quality of the evidence was rated as very low, and two weak recommendations were given. The quality and quantity of the data in the literature were considered insufficient to make a recommendation on the third question.

3.1 Question 1

In a patient who is RhD negative, when the progenitor is RhD positive or unknown, in case of induced or spontaneous abortion before 12 weeks of gestation, does the injection of RhD immune globulin reduce the risk of alloimmunization? (Table S1).

Argumentation

Benefit ofimmune globulin

Few studies have evaluated the efficacy of RhD immune globulin in preventing alloimmunization in the first trimester. A single randomized controlled interventional trial published in 1972 compared administration of RhD immune globulin with no administration of RhD immune globulin. In this previous study of spontaneous abortions, a total of 19 patients (14 with surgical treatment) received prophylaxis (RhD immune globulin μg IM within 72 h) compared with 38 patients (34 with surgical treatment) in the control group. Gestational ages, which were not reported in detail, ranged from eight to 24 weeks of gestation. There were no cases of immunization in this study, but the number of patients involved was small and there was a potential lack of power. There are two other interventional studies, including spontaneous abortion with surgical treatment, that compared administration of RhD immune globulin with no administration. However, these studies contain numerous biases that severely limit the reliability of the results: recruitment bias (RHD phenotype of progenitor not systematically known), selection bias (lack of randomization or randomization not detailed), and detection bias (diagnostic method for alloimmunization not optimal).

The opinion from British authorities is that anti-D immunoglobulin may be unnecessary with a threatened abortion and viable fetus before 12 weeks' gestation; however, the same group suggests it may be prudent to administer anti-D immunoglobulin when there is "heavy" bleeding or associated abdominal pain, or when the event occurs near 12 weeks' gestation, and ACOG states there is no evidence-based recommendation and that many physicians do not treat when there is a live embryo or fetus. The need for prophylaxis in a complete spontaneous abortion is not questioned by any of the reviewed authorities and is a Level A recommendation by ACOG; however, there is no class I evidence of this according to ACEP's methodology; thus, it is presented as a Level B recommendation, and the recommended dose of anti-D immunoglobulin is 50 µg.

5 MISCARRIAGE

The risk for sensitization is most probably extremely low for spontaneous abortions before 10 gestational weeks 16; however, data are scarce. Based on the clinical expertise of the guideline committee from the UK's National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), it is suggested that prophylaxis should be given only to women who are having a spontaneous abortion or medical management of miscarriage after 10 0/7 gestational weeks. Moreover, for women who have surgical management, prophylaxis may also be considered before 10 gestational weeks. 16 Given the low fetal blood volume during early gestation, an anti‐Rh(D) immunoglobulin dose of 500 IU may be used, although there are no data to support this policy.

In a complete molar pregnancy, organogenesis does not occur; thus, sensitization to Rh(D) should not occur. However, the situation is different in a partial molar pregnancy. Because differentiating between the forms of molar pregnancy may be difficult, it is generally advised to administer anti‐Rh(D) immunoglobulin in this setting. 3

4 CONCLUSION

Although the quality of evidence from the literature is very low, it is recommended that RhD immune globulin not be administered in case of induced or spontaneous abortion or bleeding before 12 weeks of gestation to reduce the risk of alloimmunization. However, the quality and quantity of literature data was insufficient to determine whether injection of RhD immune globulin can reduce the risk of alloimmunization in ectopic pregnancy and no recommendation can be made.

### Rhesus isoimmunisation in unsensitised RhD-negative individuals seeking abortion at less than 12 weeks' gestation: a systematic review [^115H7Hts]. BMJ Sexual & Reproductive Health (2022). High credibility.

Aim

The aim of this review was to systematically review the outcome of routine anti-D administration among unsensitised rhesus (RhD)-negative individuals who have an abortion. This review is registered with Prospero.

Methods

A search for all published and ongoing studies, without restrictions on language or publication status, was performed using the following databases from their inception: EBM Reviews Ovid - Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE Ovid (Epub Ahead of Print, In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations and Daily), Embase.com, Popline and Google Scholar. Study types included: randomised controlled trials, controlled trials, cohort and case–control studies from 1971 onwards. The population included women who undergo an abortion (induced, incomplete, spontaneous or septic abortion), medical or surgical < 12 weeks, and isoimmunisation in a subsequent pregnancy. The primary outcomes were: (1) development of a positive Kleihauer–Betke test and (2) development of Rh alloimmunisation in a subsequent pregnancy.

Results

A total of 2652 studies were screened with 105 accessed for full-text review. Two studies have been included with high bias appreciated. Both studies found few women to be sensitised in forming antibodies after an abortion. The limited studies available and heterogeneity prevent the conduction of a meta-analysis.

Conclusions

Rh immunoglobulin has well-documented safety. However, it is not without risks and costs, is a possible barrier to delivering efficient services, and may have limited availability in some countries. The evidence base and quality of studies are currently limited. There is unclear benefit from the recommendation for Rh testing and immunoglobulin administration in early pregnancy. More research is needed as clinical practice guidelines are varied, based on expert opinions and moving away from testing and administration at time of abortion.

Implications

There is limited evidence surrounding medical benefit of Rh testing and immunoglobulin administration in early pregnancy. Further research is needed to define alloimmunisation and immunoglobulin benefit to update standards of care. Additionally, other factors should be considered in forming clinical policies and guidelines such as costs, feasibility and impact on access to care for patients.

### Anti-D administration in pregnancy for preventing rhesus alloimmunisation [^111xqPTY]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

During pregnancy, a Rhesus negative (Rh-negative) woman may develop antibodies when her fetus is Rhesus positive (Rh-positive). These antibodies may harm Rh-positive babies.

Objectives

To assess the effects of antenatal anti-D immunoglobulin on the incidence of Rhesus D alloimmunisation when given to Rh-negative women without anti-D antibodies.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (31 May 2015) and reference lists of retrieved studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised trials in Rh-negative women without anti-D antibodies given anti-D after 28 weeks of pregnancy, compared with no treatment, placebo or a different regimen of anti-D.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data and checked them for accuracy.

Main Results

We included two trials involving over 4500 women, comparing anti-D prophylaxis with no anti-D during pregnancy in this review. Overall, the trials were judged to be at moderate to high risk of bias. The quality of the evidence for pre-specified outcomes was also assessed using the GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach. In regards to primary review outcomes, there did not appear to be a clear difference in the risks of immunisation when women who received anti-D at 28 and 34 weeks' gestation were compared with women who were not given antenatal anti-D: risk ratio (RR) for incidence of Rhesus D alloimmunisation during pregnancy was 0.42 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.15 to 1.17, two trials, 3902 women; GRADE: low quality evidence); at birth of a Rh-positive infant the RR was 0.42 (95% CI 0.15 to 1.17, two trials, 2297 women); and within 12 months after birth of a Rh-positive infant the average RR was 0.39 (95% CI 0.10 to 1.62, two trials, 2048 women; Tau²: 0.47; I²: 39%; GRADE: low quality evidence). Neither of the trials reported on incidence of Rhesus D alloimmunisation in subsequent pregnancies. Considering secondary outcomes, in one trial, women receiving anti-D during pregnancy were shown to be less likely to register a positive Kleihauer test (which detects fetal cells in maternal blood) in pregnancy (at 32 to 25 weeks) (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.88; 1884 women; GRADE: low quality evidence) and at the birth of a Rh-positive infant (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.79; 1189 women; GRADE: low quality evidence). No clear differences were seen for neonatal jaundice (RR 0.26, 95% CI 0.03 to 2.30; 1882 infants; GRADE: very low quality evidence). Neither of the trials reported on adverse effects associated with anti-D treatment.

Authors' Conclusions

Existing studies do not provide conclusive evidence that the use of anti-D during pregnancy benefits either mother or baby in terms of incidence of Rhesus D alloimmunisation during the pregnancy or postpartum, or the incidence of neonatal morbidity (jaundice) (low to very low quality evidence). However women receiving anti-D may be less likely to register a positive Kleihauer test in pregnancy and at the birth of a Rh-positive infant (low quality evidence). Fewer women who receive anti-D during pregnancy may have Rhesus D antibodies in a subsequent pregnancy, with benefits for the baby, however this needs to be tested in studies of robust design.

### International guidelines regarding the role of IVIG in the management of Rh-and ABO-mediated haemolytic disease of the newborn [^1148egfY]. British Journal of Haematology (2022). Medium credibility.

METHODS

An international panel of haematologists, neonatologists and transfusion specialists was convened. A systematic search for articles published (1946–2021) in MEDLINE, EMBASE, NHS Economic Evaluation Database, HTA and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and SR was completed (Appendix S1) and the systematic review was registered in Prospero (CRD42019142072). Study inclusion criteria were: (1) original peer‐reviewed; (2) at least five neonates with diagnosis or at risk of HDN; (3) comparing either of the following interventions: PT or ET, with IVIG; (4) reporting one of the following outcomes: bilirubin level, anaemia, frequency of RBC transfusions, neurocognitive outcome or mortality; (5) RCT or comparative trial; (6) English. A secondary search with a focus on ABO‐mediated HDN was performed. Two reviewers (LL, NS) screened publications for eligibility, independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias using criteria established for the reporting of randomized and non‐randomized studies. Meta‐analyses were conducted if not available from previously published systematic reviews.

Recommendations were formulated on the basis of the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) and the level of evidence was graded as high, moderate, low or very low. Recommendation strength was evaluated as strong or conditional. The panel ranked clinical outcomes relevant for the development of recommendations according to GRADE. (Appendix S2) Web conferences and electronic correspondence were used to discuss the clinical questions and formulate recommendations. Electronic surveys were sent to members to assess agreement with recommendations. Disagreements were resolved by group discussions. If disagreements could not be resolved, a recommendation was accepted if the majority (≥ 50%) agreed. Members recorded their disclosures but none were excluded from voting. The final guidance document was sent to numerous societies for feedback (Appendix S3).

The recommendations will be reviewed every two years from publication. If a study is published that may impact patients prior to that time, a comment will be added on the International Collaboration for Transfusion Medicine Guidelines (ICTMG) website along with the guideline and additional resources for physicians and patients.

### Appropriate provision of anti-D prophylaxis to RhD negative pregnant women: a scoping review [^111mJdxy]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2014). Low credibility.

Education

Thorpe's review article is an example of an educational attempt to improve the quality of care for RhD negative pregnant women with a focus on blunt trauma. In Nova Scotia there is an active continuing medical education program and reporting system for RhD negative pregnancies. These two examples provide strategies for continued education in this area. Based on the results of this review continued education should focus on routine antenatal and potential sensitizing situations. In addition, continued education regarding communication would help to improve the quality of care by ensuring the issues related to mismanagement are not caused by communication factors. An Australian study found that rural physicians were more likely to deliver anti-D immunoglobulin in situations of threatened miscarriages than urban physicians. Although the definition of rural is not provided and the study is a self-reported survey of individual practices, an exploration into what aspects of rural practice and/or education that lead to the increased provision of anti-D in situations of threatened miscarriage by rural physicians would be helpful.

The definition of shared-care states that patients are provided with the opportunity to engage and collaborate in health care decision-making. Only two studies mentioned the role of RhD negative women in the management of their pregnancy. The limited literature in this area requires further exploration. Shared care and patient engagement literature provides evidence that patients require knowledge and information in order to engage in their care. Therefore, it is suggested that women need to be informed of their blood type, perhaps prior to pregnancy, and educated about RhD factor and the risks that lie therein.

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the initial evaluation and management of patients presenting to the emergency department in early pregnancy [^116sBvz6]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

This clinical policy from the American College of Emergency Physicians is the revision of the 2003 Clinical Policy: Critical Issues in the Initial Evaluation and Management of Patients Presenting to the Emergency Department in Early Pregnancy.(1) A writing subcommittee reviewed the literature to derive evidence-based recommendations to help clinicians answer the following critical questions: (1) Should the emergency physician obtain a pelvic ultrasound in a clinically stable pregnant patient who presents to the emergency department (ED) with abdominal pain and/or vaginal bleeding and a beta human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG) level below a discriminatory threshold? (2) In patients who have an indeterminate transvaginal ultrasound, what is the diagnostic utility of β-hCG for predicting possible ectopic pregnancy? (3) In patients receiving methotrexate for confirmed or suspected ectopic pregnancy, what are the implications for ED management? Evidence was graded and recommendations were developed based on the strength of the available data in the medical literature. A literature search was also performed for a critical question from the 2003 clinical policy.(1) Is the administration of anti-D immunoglobulin indicated among Rh-negative women during the first trimester of pregnancy with threatened abortion, complete abortion, ectopic pregnancy, or minor abdominal trauma? Because no new, high-quality articles were found, the management recommendations from the previous policy are discussed in the introduction.

### Prevention of RhD alloimmunization in the first trimester of pregnancy: clinical practice guidelines of the French college of obstetricians and gynecologists [^114xmoM1]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

We decided to address the following three PICO questions with a five‐person working group:

Question 1: In a patient who is RhD negative, when the progenitor is RhD positive or unknown, in case of induced or spontaneous abortion before 12 weeks of gestation, does the injection of RhD immune globulin reduce the risk of alloimmunization?

Question 2: In a patient who is RhD negative, when the progenitor is RhD positive or unknown, in case of bleeding in an ongoing pregnancy before 12 weeks of gestation, does the injection of RhD immune globulin reduce the risk of alloimmunization?

Question 3: In a patient who is RhD negative, when the progenitor is RhD positive or unknown, in case of ectopic pregnancy, does the injection of RhD immune globulin reduce the risk of alloimmunization?

12 DOSAGE OF ANTI‐RH(D) IMMUNOGLOBULIN

Surprisingly little is known about the optimal dose of anti‐Rh(D) immunoglobulin. Postpartum, a dose of 1500 IU may be slightly better than 500 IU, but financial restriction may prompt use of the lower dose. In early pregnancy, the amount of fetal–maternal hemorrhage is bound to be low; therefore, a dose of 500 IU should generally be enough. Prophylaxis in the third trimester should optimally consist of a dose of 1500 IU given once between 28 and 34 weeks. No information is available on the immunoglobulin dose that should be given after maternal vaginal bleeding, abdominal trauma, or fetal death. However, the Kleihauer–Betke test is very useful and provides dosing guidance for abdominal trauma or fetal death.

Minor abdominal trauma in pregnancy — Rh-negative prophylaxis: In one study of pregnant patients with minor trauma who were stable and required no surgery or admission and had only contusions or superficial lacerations, 28% of patients had fetomaternal hemorrhage. Patient management recommendations list Level A and Level B recommendations as none specified and Level C recommendations to consider administration of anti-D immunoglobulin in cases of minor trauma in Rh-negative patients. The text notes equivocal ACOG recommendations to consider alloimmunization and use of anti-D immunoglobulin in trauma, no direct data on first-trimester risk, and insufficient evidence to establish clear guidelines.

### Intramuscular versus intravenous anti-D for preventing rhesus alloimmunization during pregnancy [^112GwmKs]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Antibodies to the red cell Rhesus D (RhD) antigen can be produced during pregnancy in a RhD-negative mother carrying a RhD-positive fetus, in particular following feto-maternal haemorrhage at birth or following any procedure that may cause feto-maternal haemorrhage. While the first baby is usually not harmed, these antibodies may cause haemolytic disease of the fetus/newborn (HDFN) in subsequent RhD-positive babies. RhD incompatibility is a major cause of HDFN. To reduce the risk of HDFN, anti-D is given to RhD-negative mothers at 28 or 30 weeks of pregnancy and within 72 hours of potential maternal exposure to fetal red cells. Anit-D is currently available in both intramuscular (IM) and intravenous (IV) preparations.

Objectives

To compare the efficacy and effectiveness of IM versus IV anti-D IgG in preventing RhD alloimmunization in RhD-negative pregnant women.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (30 September 2012).

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials, quasi-randomized trials and cluster-randomized trials comparing IM and IV anti-D for preventing RhD alloimmunization in RhD-negative pregnant women.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and assessed trial quality. Two review authors extracted data. Data were checked for consistency by both authors.

Main Results

Two studies involving 447 (with sample sizes 14 and 432) RhD negative women were included. The studies compared IM and IV administration of anti-D prophylaxis. In both studies the women received a 1500 IU (300 microgram) dose of Rhophylac during week 28 of gestation. There was no incidence of RhD alloimmunization in either of the studies, as the sample size was insufficient for meaningful comparison of this uncommon outcome. One of the studies found that the mean anti-D IgG concentrations after IV and IM administration differed up to seven days (36.1 (2.6) ng/mL IV; 19.8 (8.7) ng/mL IM on day seven). However, from two to three weeks post-administration, the concentrations were similar for both routes of administration. None of the women involved in the studies developed antibodies against the RhD antigen.

Authors' Conclusions

It appears that IM and IV administration of anti-D are equally effective. The number of included studies and the number of participants are not enough to assess whether there are any differences. Anti-D can be administered by IM or IV injection. The choice of IM or IV route of administration will depend on the available preparations, the dose to be administered and also on the patients' preferences. This review found insufficient information upon which to guide practice due to the limited number of included studies, small sample sizes and methodological limitations.

### International guidelines regarding the role of IVIG in the management of Rh-and ABO-mediated haemolytic disease of the newborn [^111XQJiJ]. British Journal of Haematology (2022). Medium credibility.

Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) is used to delay or avoid ET. IVIG blocks Fc receptors on macrophages which reduces destruction of antibody‐coated RBCs, enhancing the clearance of maternal antibodies and lowering the circulating unconjugated bilirubin levels. Although a number of randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) have shown that IVIG is effective in decreasing the need for ET, these RCTs had moderate to high risk of bias and the majority were conducted prior to use of high‐intensity PT. Several international guidelines recommend IVIG, particularly if the total serum bilirubin is rising despite intensive therapy or the bilirubin level is within 2–3 mg/dl (34–51 mmol/l) of the threshold level when ET is used. IVIG use is not without risks and has been associated with haemolysis, and necrotizing enterocolitis. As there is uncertainty about the optimal strategy for HDN, we embarked on a guideline development initiative to address whether the use of IVIG in neonates with RhD or ABO‐mediated HDN in addition to intensive PT was associated with the following outcomes: mortality, neurocognitive outcomes (encephalopathy, acute impairment, chronic impairment), need for or frequency of ET, bilirubin level, frequency of RBC transfusions (number or volume), severity of anaemia or duration of hospitalization?

### The continuing burden of Rh disease 50 years after the introduction of anti-Rh (D) immunoglobin prophylaxis: call to action [^113rq7Fw]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). Medium credibility.

Severe morbidity and death because of Rh disease have only been reduced by approximately 50% globally during the last 50 years, despite the advent of anti-Rh(D) immunoglobin prophylaxis, which has resulted in > 160,000 perinatal deaths and 100,000 disabilities annually. This apparent failure to take appropriate preventive measures is of great concern. Thus, there is a great need to do much better. We wish to draw attention to the unnecessary continuing burden of Rh disease, to discuss some of the reasons for this failure, and to provide suggestions for a better way forward.

### Appropriate provision of anti-D prophylaxis to RhD negative pregnant women: a scoping review [^112CqSQy]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2014). Low credibility.

The studies included in this review span twenty-two years, the earliest study dating back to 1992. The last ten years has seen only six studies addressing this topic despite recent guideline development and implementation. These five studies (and one review) continue to find opportunities for improved management of RhD negative pregnancies, particularly in situations for which sensitizing events occur. Guidelines on the prevention of RhD alloimmunization do not provide strong recommendations for situations involving sensitizing events, particularly in the first trimester. This is a result of a paucity of evidence regarding the effectiveness of anti-D immunoglobulin in the first trimester after a sensitizing event. This lack of evidence is one of the reasons guidelines are lacking strong recommendations. Consequently, the delivery of anti-D immunoglobulin continues to be problematic and quality improvement remains suboptimal.

Few studies provide recommendations for an improvement in the delivery of anti-D immunoglobulin. The most recent Canadian study suggests that improved communication and patient education for RhD negative pregnant women would potentially improve adherence. The same study suggests that a checklist system, such as the one described in the results section discussing post-natal administration of anti-D immunoglobulin would be helpful in antenatal situations. A team-based approach involving nurses with specific checklists in place and/or a clinic specific to the administration of anti-D immunoglobulin are other recommendations put forth by Koby et al. These suggestions need to be integrated into the management of RhD negative pregnancies both in hospital and primary care settings. These interventions need to be evaluated for effectiveness and quality improvement.

### Mechanism of anti-D-mediated immune suppression – a paradox awaiting resolution? [^1168f48U]. Trends in Immunology (2001). Low credibility.

During pregnancy, women can be immunized by fetal red blood cells (RBCs) of an incompatible blood group. Subsequent transplacental passage of the antibodies can result in fetal morbidity or mortality due to RBC destruction. The administration of anti-D antibodies to D(-) women after delivery of a D(+) infant, and subsequent prevention of Rhesus (Rh) D haemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn, is the most successful clinical use of antibody-mediated immune suppression. The passive IgG anti-D might prevent immunization to D(+) RBCs by an IgG Fcgamma receptor (Fcgamma R)-dependent mechanism such as crosslinking the D-specific B-cell receptor and inhibitory FcgammaRIIb. However, recent murine studies demonstrate that the suppressive effects of antibodies to heterologous RBCs can be Fcgamma R-independent, suggesting other mechanisms might contribute.

### Clinical practice guideline revision: management of hyperbilirubinemia in the newborn infant 35 or more weeks of gestation [^11759EK5]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Isoimmune hemolytic disease prevention in pregnancy — maternal testing and postpartum follow-up are specified: Prevention of hyperbilirubinemia begins in pregnancy by recognizing and treating women who are at risk for developing antibodies to red cell antigens, which can lead to hemolytic disease of the newborn (ie, isoimmune hemolytic disease). If the mother was not screened for anti-erythrocyte antibodies during pregnancy, evaluation and treatment should occur shortly after delivery. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends that pregnant women be tested to determine their ABO blood group and Rh(D) type and receive an antibody screen to determine the need for Rh(D) immunoglobulin (RhIg).

### Appropriate provision of anti-D prophylaxis to RhD negative pregnant women: a scoping review [^112gqeX1]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2014). Low credibility.

Research

The retrospective cohort methodology is an appropriate method in researching the use of anti-D immunoglobulin in clinical settings. It would be helpful to have more studies utilizing population-based data, large multi-center studies involving prospective approaches or retrospective approaches, and more studies in Canada, Australia, and the US. Further research is required to understand the factors associated with suboptimal provision of anti-D immunoglobulin in situations where potential sensitizing events occur. As Koby et al. suggest, errors of omission can occur in situations where the decisions are physician-dependent. However, only one study provided the factors involved in the omission of or late administration of anti-D immunoglobulin. The factors involved poor documentation, misinterpretation of laboratory results, issues with storage of the prophylaxis, and communication between departments. In addition, a better understanding of women's knowledge and experiences with RhD negative pregnancies and its possible implications would provide further insight into RhD alloimmunization. Once there is a basic understanding interventions may be developed and trialed for effectiveness.

Limitations

The limitations of this scoping review lie within the literature retrieved and included. The studies included span across several decades with the first article published in 1992. In addition, these included studies have been conducted in four different countries. The majority of articles were conducted in the UK. This means that the results of these studies are not necessarily generalizable across various countries, amongst varying clinical guidelines, with current clinical guidelines, and within different settings. Due to these limitations conducting a further systematic review of the literature is not recommended.

11 NONINVASIVE FETAL RH(D) TYPING IN THE FIRST TRIMESTER

Non‐invasive prenatal testing of cell‐free DNA in the first trimester of pregnancy may be used to determine fetal Rh(D) status. Such a policy has recently been introduced into clinical practice in countries such as Denmark, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom. A recent meta‐analysis of 60 000 participants showed that it has a very high sensitivity (99.9%; 95% CI, 99.5%–100%) and specificity (99.2%; 95% CI, 89.5%–99.5%) as compared with testing newborn's blood. 21 First‐trimester non‐invasive Rh(D) typing may therefore be used to prevent unnecessary administration of anti‐Rh(D) immunoglobulin in the course of pregnancy (routinely or following amniocentesis, etc.). Although population‐based cell‐free DNA as a method to determine Rh status may not be currently cost‐effective in all settings, 3 health policymakers should include this non‐invasive test as a future option for combating Rh disease.

8 BLEEDING AND ABDOMINAL TRAUMA IN PREGNANCY

Abdominal trauma may cause fetal–maternal transfusion, which might lead to Rh(D) alloimmunization. Although the exact risks are unknown, it is advised to administer anti‐Rh(D) immunoglobulin as prophylaxis. The same holds for prenatal hemorrhage in the second and third trimester. 3 The optimal dose of anti‐Rh(D) immunoglobulin is not known (1500 IU is most commonly used).

3 POSTPARTUM ANTI‐RH(D) IMMUNOGLOBULIN ADMINISTRATION

Rh(D) sensitization occurs in approximately 16% of pregnancies among Rh(D)‐negative women. Postpartum administration of anti‐Rh(D) immunoglobulin reduces this risk to approximately 1.5%, 3 and is the most effective intervention to prevent Rh disease in subsequent pregnancies. Therefore, this approach should have the highest priority in countries and/or regions where no, or inadequate, prophylaxis is currently provided. When an Rh(D)‐positive neonate is delivered by an Rh(D)‐negative woman, 1500 IU (equivalent to 300 µg) of anti‐Rh(D) should be administered intramuscularly within 72 hours after delivery. This is sufficient to neutralize 30 mL of Rh(D)‐positive fetal whole blood. 7 According to one study, the median fetal–maternal transfusion at delivery is approximately 0.7 mL, with a transfusion exceeding 10 mL in only approximately 1% of cases. 8 Therefore, it has been suggested that an anti‐Rh(D) dose of 500 IU (100 µg) would be sufficient. Nonetheless, the effectiveness of administering a higher standard dose has not been established, 9, 10 although a recent meta‐analysis suggests that the 1500 IU regimen has slightly better efficacy. 11

In some countries, it is policy to give a double dose of anti‐Rh(D) after a cesarean delivery. However, this does not seem to be necessary because data from a large study in the Czech Republic did not show a greater volume of fetal–maternal transfusion after cesarean delivery. 8 In case of uncertainty, a Kleihauer–Betke test may be performed to estimate the actual volume of fetal–maternal transfusion. It has been calculated that one vial of 1500 IU will prevent sensitization by 30 mL of fetal whole blood. This test is also reasonable in other settings where there is uncertainty regarding the size of a fetal–maternal hemorrhage (e.g. intrauterine fetal death). In the Kleihauer–Betke test, the percentage of fetal cells in maternal circulation is calculated by counting the number of fetal red cells in a maternal blood smear as follows: % of fetal red cells relative to maternal red cells × 50 = amount of fetal whole blood in maternal circulation (in mL).

### Rhesus D immune globulin in early pregnancy: a clinical review [^113NzwwN]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

This article reviews the actively evolving clinical practice of Rhesus D (RhD) testing and RhD immune globulin (RhIg) prophylaxis in the context of first trimester bleeding events, including abortion. It summarizes population-level data and indirect biologic studies, while comparing current guidelines for RhD testing and RhIg prophylaxis, highlighting existing discrepancies. Considerations such as cost, access, shortages, and fetal RhD status testing via noninvasive prenatal testing are addressed in this discussion. Although several organizations have updated their clinical guidelines to align with recent evidence against RhIg prophylaxis in early pregnancy, more direct clinical data is needed to develop definitive clinical guidance.

### Management of hypersensitivity reactions to anti-D immunoglobulin preparations [^1117dXu7]. Allergy (2014). Low credibility.

RhD immunoglobulin G (anti-D) administered to pregnant Rh(-) women prevents Rh isoimmunization. Its use has significantly reduced the incidence of haemolytic disease of the foetus and newborn previously responsible for one death in every 2200 births. In pregnancy, acute drug-induced hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis can have serious deleterious effects on the mother and foetus/neonate. Women can be erroneously labelled as drug allergic as the investigation of hypersensitivity reactions in pregnancy is complex and drug challenges are usually contraindicated. We present three cases of suspected anti-D hypersensitivity clinically presenting as anaphylaxis and delayed transfusion-related reaction. We also propose a new algorithm for the investigations of such reaction. It relies on detailed history, cautious interpretation of skin tests, foetal Rh genotyping from maternal blood and, in some cases, anti-D challenges. This is not to deprive women of anti-D which might put their future pregnancies at risk.

### International guidelines regarding the role of IVIG in the management of Rh-and ABO-mediated haemolytic disease of the newborn [^1161rxwR]. British Journal of Haematology (2022). Medium credibility.

Haemolytic disease of the newborn (HDN) can be associated with significant morbidity. Prompt treatment with intensive phototherapy (PT) and exchange transfusions (ETs) can dramatically improve outcomes. ET is invasive and associated with risks. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) may be an alternative therapy to prevent use of ET. An international panel of experts was convened to develop evidence-based recommendations regarding the effectiveness and safety of IVIG to reduce the need for ETs, improve neurocognitive outcomes, reduce bilirubin level, reduce the frequency of red blood cell (RBC) transfusions and severity of anaemia, and/or reduce duration of hospitalization for neonates with Rh or ABO-mediated HDN. We used a systematic approach to search and review the literature and then develop recommendations from published data. These recommendations conclude that IVIG should not be routinely used to treat Rh or ABO antibody-mediated HDN. In situations where hyperbilirubinaemia is severe (and ET is imminent), or when ET is not readily available, the role of IVIG is unclear. High-quality studies are urgently needed to assess the optimal use of IVIG in patients with HDN.

### Appropriate provision of anti-D prophylaxis to RhD negative pregnant women: a scoping review [^1166BA7o]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2014). Low credibility.

Policy

The longest retrospective study of 15 years conducted in the UK, provides data that there has been consistent errors of omission or late delivery of anti-D immunoglobulin. This study is important because it covers a lengthy period of time in reporting of anti-D immunoglobulin mismanagement but it also covers the period of guideline implementation. Throughout the 15 years of reporting new guidelines were disseminated. Despite the new guidelines mismanagement continued to occur. Perhaps continued issues are due to an increase in healthcare providers reporting or a lack of uptake or clarity of the guidelines, but nevertheless an issue regarding the delivery of anti-D immunoglobulin still occurred. Inevitably there is room for improvement in the delivery of anti-D immunoglobulin and the need for clearer guidelines with implementation plans and evaluation to ensure the uptake of evidence.

In several studies conducted in acute care settings, such as emergency departments, pregnant women with potential sensitizing events did not receive optimal care. This suggests that there are opportunities for this clinical setting to develop interventions that perhaps integrate RhD testing and the increased delivery of anti-D in clinically significant potential sensitizing situations. The opportunity for quality improvement in the management of RhD negative pregnancy is imperative.

### Appropriate provision of anti-D prophylaxis to RhD negative pregnant women: a scoping review [^113Sf88X]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The purpose of this scoping review was to review the literature on healthcare provider provision of anti-D prophylaxis to RhD negative pregnant women in appropriate clinical situations in various healthcare settings.

Methods

A scoping review framework was used to structure the process. The following databases were searched: CINAHL (EBSCO), EBM Reviews (OvidSP), Embase (OvidSP), Medline (OvidSP), and Web of Science (ISI). In addition, hand searching of article references was conducted. The search yielded 301 articles. Thirty-five articles remained for review after screening. Two team members reviewed each article using a detailed data collection sheet. A third reviewer was utilized if discrepancies occurred amongst reviewers.

Results

The review process yielded 18 included articles. The majority of the studies were conducted in the United Kingdom. Of the 18 studies, 15 were retrospective studies. The articles were largely conducted in one institution. The articles with a focus on routine antenatal provision of anti-D immunoglobulin found that it was given 80 to 90% of the time. Postpartum provision of anti-D immunoglobulin had significantly higher results of 95–100%. The review found that the delivery of anti-D immunoglobulin to RhD negative pregnant women during situations of potential sensitizing events was suboptimal.

Conclusions

The included articles examine the management of RhD negative pregnancies in various countries with existing national guidelines. The existing evidence indicates an opportunity for quality improvement in situations where potential sensitizing events are not at routine times in pregnancy, such as miscarriage or fetal demise early in pregnancy. Routine care for the prevention of RhD alloimmunization in pregnancy and postpartum appears to be fairly consistent. The paucity of recent literature in this area leads to a recommendation for further research.

### Analysis of pregnancy and neonatal outcomes in 100 pregnant women with Rh-negative blood type [^116Tq7BJ]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

The ABO and Rh, blood group systems, are recognized as highly significant in the human body, operating independently without direct correlation. Our subgroup analysis, based on maternal and neonatal ABO blood types, did not reveal significant differences in adverse pregnancy outcomes, such as fetal distress, neonatal hyperbilirubinemia, preterm birth, low birth weight, and neonatal asphyxia. According to Practical Obstetrics and Gynecology, Third Edition, ABO incompatibility between the mother and baby may provide some protection against Rh isoimmunization by preventing the stimulation of Rh antigens in the mother's body and subsequent fetal hemolysis. Further research is needed to explore the potential influence of ABO blood type on pregnancy outcomes in Rh-negative pregnant women.

The effectiveness of anti-D immunoglobulin prophylaxis in preventing RhD immunization and HDFN has been well-documented in various studies. Since its introduction in the late 1960s, anti-D immunoglobulin prophylaxis has substantially reduced the risk of sensitization from 13% to approximately 1%. A meta-analysis conducted by Turner et al. accounting for bias, robustly advocates the efficacy of anti-D immunoglobulin in averting sensitization in Rh-negative pregnant women, endorsing its utilization in all unsensitized Rh-negative pregnant women. The research proposes that the most efficacious dosage is 1250 IU of intramuscular anti-D immunoglobulin at 28 and 34 weeks of pregnancy, while a singular dose of 1500 IU at 28–30 weeks is less effective. These outcomes are consistent with the recommendations outlined in the latest clinical guidelines issued in March 2023 in Queensland. The likelihood of maternal–fetal Rh blood type incompatibility stands at approximately 1% during the initial pregnancy or shortly thereafter. HDFN can result from Rh blood type incompatibility during pregnancy, studies found that administration of 500 IU of anti-D immunoglobulin to primigravid women can diminish this probability to roughly 0.2%, with no notable adverse reactions documented. This underscores the safety of anti-D immunoglobulin administration for immunoprophylaxis. The administration of anti-D immunoglobulin within 72 h postpartum diminishes the likelihood of Rh-negative mothers birthing Rh-positive infants and developing Rh isoimmunization. In a study involving 28 neonates with hyperbilirubinemia admitted to the neonatology department for treatment, we observed a faster resolution of hyperbilirubinemia (P = 0.002) in neonates born to mothers who received anti-D immunoglobulin injections. However, no significant differences were found between the two groups in terms of the onset of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia, admission to the NICU, neonatal hemoglobin levels, total bilirubin levels, neonatal blood transfusions, neonatal ABO hemolysis, and neonatal Rh hemolysis. This observation can be attributed to the preventive role of anti-D immunoglobulin in inhibiting Rh-negative pregnant women from producing considerable quantities of anti-D antibodies. It can be seen that neonates born to mothers who received anti-D immunoglobulin demonstrate decreased hemolysis, reduced bilirubin levels, and expedited resolution of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia. Consequently, tailored management and surveillance of Rh-negative pregnant women are imperative. Discriminatory dispensation of anti-D immunoglobulin should be contemplated for unsensitized Rh-negative pregnant women to ensure appropriate usage and efficient management of neonatal hemolytic disease.

### International guidelines regarding the role of IVIG in the management of Rh-and ABO-mediated haemolytic disease of the newborn [^115njtJL]. British Journal of Haematology (2022). Medium credibility.

Recommendation for management of‐mediated

In neonates at risk of ABO‐mediated HDN, routine IVIG is not recommended to reduce the need for ET (very low certainty of evidence of effects, conditional recommendation).

The recommendations developed refer to routine use of IVIG for any neonates with Rh‐ or ABO‐mediated HDN and hyperbilirubinaemia requiring PT, but not yet at the level requiring an ET. Routine use refers to prophylactic IVIG use to prevent progression to severe consequences of hyperbilirubinaemia. Recommendations could not be made for or against use of IVIG for neonates with rapidly rising bilirubin and emergent need for ET, as no studies have addressed this specific indication.

Severe hyperbilirubinaemia unresponsive to phototherapy

In neonates where hyperbilirubinaemia is severe (unresponsive to intensive PT) and requirement for ET is emergent, but not available on site within a timely manner, no evidence‐based recommendations regarding the use of IVIG can be made. While awaiting transport to a facility where ET is available, first‐line treatment is intensive PT. Various non‐evidence‐based treatment suggestions have been described, but none can be endorsed at this time.

### Anti-D administration after spontaneous miscarriage for preventing rhesus alloimmunisation [^113cKwTi]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

During pregnancy, a Rhesus-negative (Rh-negative) woman may develop antibodies if her fetus is Rh-positive, which can cause fetal morbidity or mortality in following pregnancies, if untreated.

Objectives

To assess the effects of administering anti-D immunoglobulin (Ig) after spontaneous miscarriage in a Rh-negative woman, with no anti-D antibodies.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (31 December 2012).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCT) in Rh-negative women without antibodies who were given anti-D Ig following spontaneous miscarriage compared with no treatment or placebo treatment following spontaneous miscarriage as control.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and trial quality. Two review authors extracted data and checked it for accuracy.

Main Results

We included one RCT, involving 48 women who had a miscarriage between eight to 24 weeks of gestation. Of the 19 women in the treatment group, 14 had therapeutic dilatation & curettage (D&C) and five had spontaneous miscarriage; of the 29 women in the control group, 25 had therapeutic D&C and four had spontaneous miscarriage. The treatment group received 300 µg anti-D Ig intramuscular injection and were compared with a control group who received 1 cc homogenous gamma globulin placebo. This review's primary outcomes (development of a positive Kleihauer Betke test (a test that detects fetal cells in the maternal blood; and development of RhD alloimmunisation in a subsequent pregnancy) were not reported in the included study. Similarly, none of the review's secondary outcomes were reported in the included study: the need for increased surveillance for suspected fetal blood sampling and fetal transfusions in subsequent pregnancies, neonatal morbidity such as neonatal anaemia, jaundice, bilirubin encephalopathy, erythroblastosis, prematurity, hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) in subsequent pregnancies, maternal adverse events of anti-D administration including anaphylactic reaction and blood-borne infections. The included study did report subsequent Rh-positive pregnancies in three women in the treatment group and six women in the control group. However, due to the small sample size, the study failed to show any difference in maternal sensitisation or development of Rh alloimmunisation in the subsequent pregnancies.

Authors' Conclusions

There are insufficient data available to evaluate the practice of anti-D administration in an unsensitised Rh-negative mother after spontaneous miscarriage. Thus, until high-quality evidence becomes available, the practice of anti-D Immunoglobulin prophylaxis after spontaneous miscarriage for preventing Rh alloimmunisation cannot be generalised and should be based on the standard practice guidelines of each country.

### Updates in the prenatal management of prevention of alloimmunization… [^111L8NxV]. publications.aap.org (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Rh immune globulin, with brand names including Rhogam, WinRho, and Rhophylac, have been highly impactful in reducing the likelihood of alloimmunization from RhD and the sequelae of hemolytic disease of the newborn. A dose of Rh immune globulin given to all Rh-negative pregnant women universally in the third trimester and postpartum for those with confirmed Rh-positive neonates reduced the risk of RhD alloimmunization to 0. 4–0. 2%. 1 Currently, the standard of care by the American College of Obstetricians-Gynecologists is to provide Rh immune globulin to all Rh-negative pregnant women at 28 weeks' gestation and again postpartum if the neonate is Rh positive. 1 The use of RhIG, while impactful at reducing the risk of isoimmunization against RhD, is limited, costly, and an irradiated blood product with a theoretical risk of transmitting blood-borne viruses. 1 The supply is therefore dependent on blood donors.

Until recently, without invasive diagnostic testing such as amniocentesis or cordocentesis to assess fetal blood type, there was not a validated non-invasive means of assessing fetal Rh status. Therefore, with the inability to reliably detect Rh-negative fetuses, all pregnant Rh-negative people are recommended to receive Rh immune globulin during pregnancy to reduce the risk of alloimmunization without a means of assessing whether their fetus is Rh negative and therefore not require RhIG. This non-targeted approach of RhIG administration to all Rh-negative pregnant women leads to unnecessary prophylaxis of those women carrying fetuses who are also Rh negative. NIPT allows for detection of singleton fetuses with Rh-negative blood type who would therefore pose no risk of causing alloimmunization to a mother who similarly has Rh-negative blood.

The use of NIPT technology is estimated to decrease the use of RhIG by 40% by identifying pregnancies with a Rh-negative fetus when RhIG is not necessary during pregnancy. 2 Fortunately, the recent study 4 on NIPT did not demonstrate any false negative results indicating that there were no pregnant people who missed receiving a dose of RhIG during pregnancy when it was warranted for a Rh-positive fetus. While pregnant people should expect a test with the highest negative predictive value to avoid false negative results, a diagnostic test with neonatal cord blood typing is performed for all neonates born to Rh-negative individuals.
