## Question

What are differential diagnoses for a patient with acute renal failure on NSAIDs?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the differential diagnosis for acute renal failure in a patient taking NSAIDs. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and staging of acute kidney injury using standardized criteria. Then, I should verify the temporal relationship between NSAID exposure and the AKI onset. Next, I will categorize potential etiologies into prerenal, intrinsic renal, and postrenal causes, with special attention to NSAID-specific mechanisms. After that, I need to check for high-risk comorbidities and concomitant medications that modify risk. Finally, I will outline a diagnostic workup, including labs, urinalysis, imaging, and when to consider biopsy, and close with management principles and a concise synthesis of the differential.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and stage of AKI using KDIGO criteria, because I need to ensure we are truly dealing with an acute rise in serum creatinine of at least 0.3 mg/dL within 48 hours or a 50% increase from baseline, or oliguria less than 0.5 mL/kg/h for 6 hours, and then stage severity accordingly, since this frames both prognosis and urgency of evaluation.

> Wait, let me verify the temporal relationship between NSAID exposure and the AKI onset, because NSAID-induced AKI can be hemodynamic and occur within hours to days, or interstitial and present after days to weeks. Establishing this chronology helps distinguish functional from structural injury and guides the likelihood of reversibility with drug withdrawal [^115gJ5Rn].

> I will now examine prerenal etiologies, since NSAIDs classically cause hemodynamic AKI by inhibiting prostaglandin-mediated afferent arteriolar vasodilation, especially when renal perfusion depends on compensatory prostaglandins. This risk is amplified with volume depletion, heart failure, cirrhosis, older age, CKD, and concomitant RAAS inhibitors or diuretics, and the pattern is typically nonoliguric with low fractional excretion of sodium and bland urinalysis, improving after NSAID cessation and volume repletion [^111GTg8P] [^115TMwq1] [^115gJ5Rn].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should also consider intrinsic renal causes, particularly acute interstitial nephritis, which accounts for roughly 15–27% of biopsy-proven AKI and is a well-described NSAID complication, often presenting with sterile pyuria, hematuria, mild proteinuria, and occasionally systemic features. Definitive diagnosis rests on biopsy showing interstitial infiltrates and tubulitis, and early recognition with drug withdrawal and consideration of corticosteroids can improve outcomes, though evidence quality varies [^113cCBXR] [^114Z8zmx].

> I need to check for acute tubular injury as well, because NSAIDs can cause direct tubular epithelial injury or contribute to ischemic ATN in the setting of prolonged hypoperfusion. Urinalysis may show muddy brown granular casts and tubular epithelial cells, and while many cases recover with supportive care, some progress to dialysis, particularly when injury is severe or multifactorial [^111GTg8P].

> But wait, what if the NSAID exposure is a red herring? I should review other nephrotoxins and systemic causes that can mimic or compound NSAID injury, including contrast media, aminoglycosides, PPIs, antivirals like tenofovir, and chemotherapeutics, as well as sepsis, rhabdomyolysis, and hemolysis, because multidrug toxicity and systemic insults are common in hospitalized patients and can shift management toward broader supportive strategies and earlier nephrology input [^114NHJsm] [^114im3EJ] [^114VbWBx].

> Next, I should review postrenal causes, even though NSAIDs themselves do not typically cause obstruction. I need to ensure we exclude urinary tract obstruction from stones, malignancy, or neurogenic bladder with renal ultrasound, because missing obstruction delays definitive therapy and worsens outcomes [^115gJ5Rn].

> I should double-check for high-risk modifiers that increase NSAID nephrotoxicity, including older age, CKD, diabetes, heart failure, cirrhosis, volume depletion, and concomitant RAAS inhibitors, diuretics, or calcineurin inhibitors. These factors not only raise the relative risk of AKI but also lower the threshold for biopsy and specialist referral if the course is atypical or recovery is delayed [^111GTg8P] [^112iWAFa] [^115TMwq1].

> Let me think about the diagnostic workup I should order now. I need a basic metabolic panel to confirm creatinine trajectory and electrolytes, urinalysis with microscopy for casts, cells, and protein, urine sodium and urea to calculate FENa and FEurea to distinguish prerenal from intrinsic injury, and a renal ultrasound to exclude obstruction. If the etiology remains unclear after 48–72 hours or if there is suspicion of AIN or glomerular disease, I should consider a kidney biopsy, ideally before starting immunosuppression if AIN is suspected [^1157JGo4] [^113cCBXR].

> Hold on, I should verify medication reconciliation and explicitly stop the NSAID, because discontinuation is the cornerstone of management for NSAID-associated AKI. I also need to reassess all other nephrotoxins, correct volume status, and monitor for complications such as hyperkalemia and metabolic acidosis, escalating to dialysis if indicated by refractory electrolyte disturbances, acidosis, volume overload, or uremic symptoms [^11485sY5] [^115gJ5Rn].

> I will now examine the differential synthesis to ensure nothing is missed. In a patient with AKI on NSAIDs, the most likely diagnosis is NSAID-induced hemodynamic AKI, especially with risk factors like CKD, heart failure, cirrhosis, or RAAS inhibitor use. Alternative explanations include NSAID-induced AIN, ischemic or nephrotoxic ATN from other agents or systemic insults, and postrenal obstruction, with the final diagnosis integrating temporal exposure, urine studies, imaging, and, when needed, biopsy to distinguish functional from structural injury and guide therapy [^111GTg8P] [^113cCBXR] [^115gJ5Rn].

In patients with acute renal failure on NSAIDs, the differential includes **prerenal azotemia** from NSAID-induced hemodynamic effects (especially with volume depletion, heart failure, cirrhosis, or concomitant ACEi/ARB/diuretics) [^111GTg8P] [^115TMwq1], **acute interstitial nephritis** (AIN) with sterile pyuria, eosinophiluria, and proteinuria [^113cCBXR], and **acute tubular necrosis** (ATN) from ischemia or direct toxicity [^111GTg8P]. Less common causes include **papillary necrosis**, **crystalluria**, and **glomerular injury** (e.g. minimal change disease) [^111GTg8P] [^111YxyDK]. Evaluate with urinalysis, urine electrolytes, and renal ultrasound; consider biopsy if AIN or glomerular disease is suspected or if AKI persists after correcting prerenal factors and stopping NSAIDs [^113cCBXR].

---

## Pathophysiological mechanisms of NSAID-induced renal failure

NSAIDs impair renal function through several mechanisms, and **identifying the mechanism informs the differential**:

- **Hemodynamic effects**: NSAIDs inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, reducing renal perfusion and GFR, especially in patients dependent on renal prostaglandins (e.g. heart failure, cirrhosis, volume depletion, CKD, elderly) [^111GTg8P] [^115gJ5Rn].

- **Acute interstitial nephritis (AIN)**: Immune-mediated AIN presents with sterile pyuria, eosinophiluria, and proteinuria; biopsy shows interstitial infiltrates and edema [^113cCBXR].

- **Acute tubular necrosis (ATN)**: Ischemic or direct tubular injury from NSAIDs, often with muddy brown casts and tubular epithelial cells on urinalysis [^notfound].

- **Papillary necrosis**: Chronic NSAID use can cause renal papillary necrosis, particularly with analgesic combinations [^111GTg8P].

- **Crystalluria**: Rarely, NSAID metabolites can precipitate and cause intratubular obstruction [^114byw17].

- **Glomerular injury**: Minimal change disease or other glomerulopathies have been reported with NSAIDs, often with nephrotic-range proteinuria [^111YxyDK].

---

## Clinical presentation and laboratory findings

The presentation varies by mechanism, and **key features help distinguish them**:

| **Mechanism** | **Clinical features** | **Laboratory findings** |
|-|-|-|
| Hemodynamic AKI | - Nonoliguric <br/> - Volume depletion <br/> - Heart failure <br/> - Cirrhosis <br/> - Elderly | - Bland urinalysis <br/> - Low FENa <br/> - High BUN/Cr ratio [^notfound] |
| AIN | - Fever <br/> - Rash <br/> - Arthralgia <br/> - Eosinophilia | - Sterile pyuria <br/> - Eosinophiluria <br/> - Mild proteinuria [^113cCBXR] |
| ATN | - Oliguria <br/> - Brown casts <br/> - Recent ischemia or nephrotoxin | - Muddy brown casts <br/> - High FENa <br/> - Isosthenuria [^notfound] |
| Papillary necrosis | - Chronic NSAID use <br/> - Hematuria <br/> - Flank pain | - Calyceal filling defects on imaging [^notfound] |
| Crystalluria | - Rare <br/> - Obstructive symptoms | - Crystals on urinalysis [^notfound] |
| Glomerular injury | - Nephrotic syndrome <br/> - Edema <br/> - Hypoalbuminemia | - Heavy proteinuria <br/> - Normal renal function initially [^111YxyDK] |

---

## Differential diagnosis

Based on mechanism and clinical context, the **differential diagnosis** includes:

- **Prerenal azotemia**: NSAID-induced hemodynamic AKI, especially with volume depletion, heart failure, cirrhosis, or concomitant ACEi/ARB/diuretics [^111GTg8P] [^115TMwq1].

- **Acute interstitial nephritis (AIN)**: Immune-mediated injury with sterile pyuria, eosinophiluria, and proteinuria [^113cCBXR].

- **Acute tubular necrosis (ATN)**: Ischemic or direct tubular injury, often with muddy brown casts and high FENa [^notfound].

- **Papillary necrosis**: Chronic NSAID use causing renal papillary necrosis [^111GTg8P].

- **Crystalluria**: Rare intratubular obstruction from NSAID metabolites [^notfound].

- **Glomerular injury**: Minimal change disease or other glomerulopathies with nephrotic-range proteinuria [^111YxyDK].

---

## Diagnostic approach

A structured approach is essential, and **the following steps are recommended**:

- **Confirm AKI**: Use KDIGO criteria (rise in creatinine ≥ 0.3 mg/dL within 48 hours or ≥ 50% from baseline, or oliguria < 0.5 mL/kg/h for 6 hours) [^1157JGo4].

- **History and exam**: Assess NSAID dose/duration, volume status, comorbidities, and systemic features (fever, rash, eosinophilia) [^1157JGo4].

- **Urinalysis**: Look for proteinuria, hematuria, pyuria, casts, eosinophiluria, and crystals [^1157JGo4].

- **Urine electrolytes**: Calculate FENa and FEurea to distinguish prerenal (low FENa) from intrinsic renal failure (high FENa) [^1157JGo4].

- **Renal ultrasound**: Exclude obstruction and assess kidney size/echogenicity [^1157JGo4].

- **Biopsy**: Consider if AIN or glomerular disease is suspected, or if AKI persists after correcting prerenal factors and stopping NSAIDs [^115jUdPN].

---

## Management principles

Management depends on the **underlying mechanism**:

- **Hemodynamic AKI**: Stop NSAIDs, correct volume status, treat heart failure/cirrhosis, and avoid nephrotoxic drugs [^111GTg8P].

- **AIN**: Discontinue NSAIDs, consider corticosteroids if no recovery after 1–2 weeks, and monitor for chronic kidney disease [^113cCBXR].

- **ATN**: Supportive care, avoid nephrotoxins, and consider dialysis if indicated [^11485sY5].

- **Papillary necrosis**: Stop NSAIDs, manage complications, and monitor for chronic kidney disease [^notfound].

- **Crystalluria**: Stop NSAIDs, hydrate, and alkalinize urine if indicated [^notfound].

- **Glomerular injury**: Stop NSAIDs, consider corticosteroids, and monitor for chronic kidney disease [^notfound].

---

In patients with acute renal failure on NSAIDs, the differential includes prerenal azotemia, AIN, ATN, papillary necrosis, crystalluria, and glomerular injury. A structured diagnostic approach — urinalysis, urine electrolytes, imaging, and selective biopsy — guides **targeted management** and improves outcomes.

### Need for a judicious use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs to avoid community-acquired acute kidney injury [^112FzdNJ]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Millions of Americans use over-the-counter analgesics on a daily basis, and nearly 100 million nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) prescriptions are filled per year. In high-risk patients, these medications can disrupt kidney hemodynamics and precipitate community-acquired acute kidney injury (CA-AKI). The risk of NSAID-associated CA-AKI increases 3- to 5-fold in patients taking renin-angiotensin system inhibitors and diuretics concurrently. CA-AKI increases the risk of developing chronic kidney disease (CKD) or accelerating progression of pre-existing CKD. Importantly, many cases of NSAID-induced CA-AKI may be avoided by identifying high-risk patients and providing patient and provider education on when to avoid these medications and minimize risk.

### Best practices guidelines for acute pain management in trauma patients [^111stx8T]. ACS (2020). High credibility.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for acute traumatic pain are supported as effective and opioid-sparing, with multiple studies establishing NSAIDs as equally effective to opioids for acute traumatic pain in adults and children, and when used alone or in combination with opioids, NSAIDs can greatly decrease opioid requirements. NSAIDs carry notable risks of gastrointestinal bleeding, acute kidney injury, and cardiovascular events; most risks are associated with long-term use, and risks may vary by COX selectivity, even between drugs in the same class, and although the primary risk of NSAID therapy is gastrointestinal bleeding, all NSAIDs have antiplatelet activity contributing to an increased risk of bleeding at any site. Antiplatelet effects occur mainly through COX-1 inhibition; therefore, selective COX-2 NSAIDs (e.g., celecoxib) have decreased risk of inhibiting platelet aggregation, and while no high-quality evidence exists regarding the use of NSAIDs in the presence of traumatic brain injury (TBI) or intracranial hemorrhage, most practitioners avoid the use of both COX-1 and COX-2 inhibitors in this setting. Perioperatively, NSAIDs are sometimes held preoperatively depending upon type of case and surgeon preference, prophylactic use of preoperative ketorolac is contraindicated due to bleeding risk, and clinicians should weigh the risk and impact of bleeding against the benefit of analgesia on a case-by-case basis; use NSAIDs cautiously in patients after colorectal resection because limited evidence suggests an increased risk of anastomotic failure. In musculoskeletal and spine contexts, recent literature demonstrates that short-term, early NSAID use does not increase risk of fracture nonunion, and a similar dose and duration-dependent effect is seen in spinal fusion, with early short (less than 48 hours) administration not having a significant deleterious effect on bony fusion, but aiding in early mobilization and discharge; avoid longer term (2 weeks or longer) use of NSAIDs in the setting of fracture. Use of NSAIDs, particularly at scheduled intervals, may contribute to or complicate the differential diagnosis of acute kidney injury, which develops in at least 30% of patients in ICU settings, and NSAIDs require caution when used in coagulopathic patients or those otherwise at risk for stress-related mucosal bleeding.

There is little evidence about the risk of AKI associated with NSAID use in people with CKD available from randomised trials of NSAIDs because such trials routinely exclude people with CKD and rarely report renal outcomes. Under these circumstances, observational evidence provides the best guide to practice that exists. The aim of this study is to systematically review published high-quality population-based observational studies to quantify the risk of AKI due to NSAIDs in the general population and in people with pre-existing CKD.

### Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug induced acute kidney injury in the community dwelling general population and people with chronic kidney disease: systematic review and meta-analysis [^114byw17]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are commonly prescribed in primary care for their analgesic, antipyretic and anti-inflammatory effects. One in fifteen US adults are actively prescribed NSAIDs at any one time, and in many countries low-dose preparations are also available over-the-counter (OCT). Partly due to their widespread use, NSAIDs account for 25% of adverse drug events (ADEs) reported in the United Kingdom ﻿﻿(UK) and 21% in the United States (US). NSAIDs are also commonly implicated in hospital admissions due to ADEs, including those which are fatal, but gastrointestinal and cardiac toxicity are better quantified than renal toxicity.

NSAIDs can reduce renal blood flow, cause tubular obstruction through crystal deposition, and induce direct cytotoxicity and cell-mediated immune injury mechanisms leading to the occurrence of acute kidney injury (AKI). Another symptom that is commonly caused by NSAIDs is interstitial nephritis (AIN) which requires specialist review, renal biopsy, high-dose corticosteroid and/or immunosuppressant treatments, and will normally be progression in chronic kidney disease (CKD). Older age and underlying chronic kidney disease are also related to the onset of AKI during NSAID use, with early studies showing that the risk of deterioration in renal function increases 3–4 fold in patients with abnormal baseline renal function compared to those with normal renal function. Notably, NSAIDs are commonly prescribed to people with CKD, despite guidance to avoid them in this population. In US veterans in 2005, 15.4% of people with CKD were prescribed traditional NSAIDs or COX-2 inhibitors, compared to 11.1% of people with CKD in the UK in 2012, and 15.9% of people with CKD in Australia in 2004–2006. Better quantification of risk in people with CKD is therefore of particular clinical interest, as is whether NSAID risk varies by age and by COX-2 selectivity. In terms of COX-2 selectivity, early studies suggested that COX-2-selective inhibitors caused fewer renal adverse effects including reduction in glomerular filtration rate (GFR), increased serum creatinine (SCr) and hypertension. Other studies have shown no significant differences in renal risk between COX-2-selective inhibitors and nonselective NSAIDs.

### Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and non-opioids for acute renal colic [^117HRinV]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Renal colic is acute pain caused by urinary stones. The prevalence of urinary stones is between 10% and 15% in the United States, making renal colic one of the common reasons for urgent urological care. The pain is usually severe and the first step in the management is adequate analgesia. Many different classes of medications have been used in this regard including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and narcotics.

Objectives

The aim of this review was to assess benefits and harms of different NSAIDs and non-opioids in the treatment of adult patients with acute renal colic and if possible to determine which medication (or class of medications) are more appropriate for this purpose. Clinically relevant outcomes such as efficacy of pain relief, time to pain relief, recurrence of pain, need for rescue medication and side effects were explored.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Renal Group's Specialised Register (to 27 November 2014) through contact with the Trials' Search Co-ordinator using search terms relevant to this review.

Selection Criteria

Only randomised or quasi randomised studies were included. Other inclusion criteria included adult patients with a clinical diagnosis of renal colic due to urolithiasis, at least one treatment arm included a non-narcotic analgesic compared to placebo or another non-narcotic drug, and reporting of pain outcome or medication adverse effect. Patient-rated pain by a validated tool, time to relief, need for rescue medication and pain recurrence constituted the outcomes of interest. Any adverse effects (minor or major) reported in the studies were included.

Data Collection and Analysis

Abstracts were reviewed by at least two authors independently. Papers meeting the inclusion criteria were fully reviewed and relevant data were recorded in a standardized Cochrane Renal Group data collection form. For dichotomous outcomes relative risks and 95% confidence intervals were calculated. For continuous outcomes the weighted mean difference was estimated. Both fixed and random models were used for meta-analysis. We assessed the analgesic effects using four different outcome variables: patient-reported pain relief using a visual analogue scale (VAS); proportion of patients with at least 50% reduction in pain; need for rescue medication; and pain recurrence. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I² test.

Main Results

A total of 50 studies (5734 participants) were included in this review and 37 studies (4483 participants) contributed to our meta-analyses. Selection bias was low in 34% of the studies or unclear in 66%; performance bias was low in 74%, high in 14% and unclear in 12%; attrition bias was low in 82% and high in 18%; selective reporting bias low in 92% of the studies; and other biases (industry funding) was high in 4%, unclear in 18% and low in 78%. Patient-reported pain (VAS) results varied widely with high heterogeneity observed. For those comparisons which could be pooled we observed the following: NSAIDs significantly reduced pain compared to antispasmodics (5 studies, 303 participants: MD -12.97, 95% CI -21.80 to - 4.14; I² = 74%) and combination therapy of NSAIDs plus antispasmodics was significantly more effective in pain control than NSAID alone (2 studies, 310 participants: MD -1.99, 95% CI -2.58 to -1.40; I² = 0%).NSAIDs were significantly more effective than placebo in reducing pain by 50% within the first hour (3 studies, 197 participants: RR 2.28, 95% CI 1.47 to 3.51; I² = 15%). Indomethacin was found to be less effective than other NSAIDs (4 studies, 412 participants: RR 1.27, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.60; I² = 55%). NSAIDs were significantly more effective than hyoscine in pain reduction (5 comparisons, 196 participants: RR 2.44, 95% CI 1.61 to 3.70; I² = 28%). The combination of NSAIDs and antispasmodics was not superior to NSAIDs only (9 comparisons, 906 participants: RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.13; I² = 59%). The results were mixed when NSAIDs were compared to other non-opioid medications. When the need for rescue medication was evaluated, Patients receiving NSAIDs were significantly less likely to require rescue medicine than those receiving placebo (4 comparisons, 180 participants: RR 0.35, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.60; I² = 24%) and NSAIDs were more effective than antispasmodics (4 studies, 299 participants: RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.84; I² = 65%). Combination of NSAIDs and antispasmodics was not superior to NSAIDs (7 comparisons, 589 participants: RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.57; I² = 10%). Indomethacin was less effective than other NSAIDs (4 studies, 517 participants: RR 1.36, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.94; I² = 14%) except for lysine acetyl salicylate (RR 0.15, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.65). Pain recurrence was reported by only three studies which could not be pooled: a higher proportion of patients treated with 75 mg diclofenac (IM) showed pain recurrence in the first 24 hours of follow-up compared to those treated with 40 mg piroxicam (IM) (60 participants: RR 0.05, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.81); no significant difference in pain recurrence at 72 hours was observed between piroxicam plus phloroglucinol and piroxicam plus placebo groups (253 participants: RR 2.52, 95% CI 0.15 to12.75); and there was no significant difference in pain recurrence within 72 hours of discharge between IM piroxicam and IV paracetamol (82 participants: RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.54). Side effects were presented inconsistently, but no major events were reported.

Authors' Conclusions

Although due to variability in studies (inclusion criteria, outcome variables and interventions) and the evidence is not of highest quality, we still believe that NSAIDs are an effective treatment for renal colic when compared to placebo or antispasmodics. The addition of antispasmodics to NSAIDS does not result in better pain control. Data on other types of non-opioid, non-NSAID medication was scarce. Major adverse effects are not reported in the literature for the use of NSAIDs for treatment of renal colic.

### Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug induced acute kidney injury in the community dwelling general population and people with chronic kidney disease: systematic review and meta-analysis [^112LvcVB]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusion

AKI is an increasingly common global problem causing significant morbidity and mortality and with large resource implications. Exposure to NSAIDS and other nephrotoxic drugs is an important cause of AKI, but the risk of these exposures is modified by susceptibilities such as increasing age and the presence of CKD. This study found that the odds of developing AKI increased by over 50% in people who were exposed to NSAIDs in the general population and in people with CKD, and in older people the odds of developing AKI doubled. However, the absolute risk of developing AKI also depends on the baseline risk of AKI in the population exposed, which none of the included studies reported. Future studies should use internationally agreed definitions of AKI and estimate the absolute risk of AKI in different populations including older people and people with CKD to better inform clinical decision making. There is evidence that feedback and more complex interventions to reduce NSAID prescribing in people at high risk of renal adverse effects are effective, and clinicians should seek to minimise NSAID exposure in people particularly susceptible to AKI due to age, CKD or because of the co-prescription of other nephrotoxic drugs.

NSAIDs in chronic kidney disease — adverse effects and reversibility: NSAIDs may cause gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, and kidney adverse events and, by blunting prostaglandin-associated regulation of renal hemodynamics, can induce renal ischemia. NSAIDs can also increase blood pressure, cause edema and sodium retention (mostly mild), induce hyperkalemia, and contribute to heart failure, and NSAID-induced kidney injury is typically reversible with prompt discontinuation.

### Using non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in volume depleted children can precipitate acute renal failure [^113FnHx9]. BMJ Case Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are increasingly popular in hospital medicine and general practice and are readily available over the counter. The vast majority of healthy children who ingest therapeutic doses of NSAIDs for a limited duration tolerate them without any significant adverse effects. However, the risk of renal toxicity is potentially increased in situations where there is stimulation of the renin-angiotensin system such as with volume depletion or in pre-existing chronic renal disease. We describe four cases which illustrate this complication occurring in a children's hospital. We have not proven cause and effect, but further research is needed to define the true risk of the potential renal complications of NSAIDs in patients at risk of dehydration.

### KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease [^1173P22p]. Kidney International (2024). High credibility.

KDIGO 2024 CKD — acute gout management in chronic kidney disease (CKD): For symptomatic treatment of acute gout in CKD, low-dose colchicine or intra-articular/oral glucocorticoids are preferable to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Administration early after symptom onset is encouraged. For colchicine, the US Food and Drug Administration–approved dosing is 1.2 mg immediately followed by 0.6 mg an hour later, with ongoing anti-inflammatory therapy until the flare has resolved; dose adjustment should be considered for CKD G5. NSAIDs can cause toxicity in CKD and need to be used cautiously, and short courses of oral glucocorticoids such as 30 mg prednisone orally for 3–5 days could be used as an alternative.

### Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and risk of ARF in the general population [^114AZNgu]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Most epidemiological studies evaluating the association between nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and acute renal failure (ARF) found an increased risk for developing ARF while taking NSAIDs. Despite these studies, little is known about the effect of dose and duration of therapy, risk of individual NSAIDs, comorbidity, or concomitant use of other nephrotoxic drugs.

Methods

This is a nested case-control study using the General Practice Research Database from the United Kingdom. Participants were 386,916 patients aged 50 to 84 years on January 1, 1997, and free of known cancer, renal disorder, cirrhosis, or systemic connective tissue disease. After validation of cases identified from this cohort, 103 patients were confirmed as idiopathic cases of ARF and compared with 5,000 controls frequency matched by age and sex.

Results

Current users of NSAIDs had a relative risk (RR) for ARF of 3.2 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.8 to 5.8), and the risk declined after treatment was discontinued. Increased risk was present with both short- and long-term therapy and was slightly greater among users of high doses. History of heart failure (HF), hypertension, diabetes, and hospitalizations and consultant visits in the previous year were all associated with a greater risk for ARF. There was a suggestion of a modification of the effect of NSAIDs in patients with hypertension and those with HF. Use of selected cardiovascular drugs was associated with a 5-fold increase in risk for ARF. Diuretics presented the greatest risk. Risk increased with concomitant use of NSAIDs and diuretics (RR, 11.6; 95% CI, 4.2 to 32.2) and NSAIDs and calcium channel blockers (RR, 7.8; 95% CI, 3.0 to 20.5).

Conclusion

NSAID users had a 3-fold greater risk for developing a first-ever diagnosis of clinical ARF compared with non-NSAID users in the general population. NSAIDs should be used with special caution in patients with hypertension and/or HF.

### Using NSAID in volume depleted children can precipitate acute renal failure [^114LgPCk]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2007). Low credibility.

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) are increasingly popular in hospital medicine and general practice and are readily available over the counter. The vast majority of healthy children who ingest therapeutic doses of NSAID for a limited duration tolerate them without any significant adverse effects. However, the risk of renal toxicity is potentially increased in situations where there is stimulation of the renin-angiotensin system such as with volume depletion or in pre-existing chronic renal disease. We describe four cases which illustrate this complication occurring in a children's hospital. We have not proven cause and effect, but further research is needed to define the true risk of the potential renal complications of NSAID in patients at risk of dehydration.

### Effects of peri-operative nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs on post-operative kidney function for adults with normal kidney function [^11592NKf]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) provide effective analgesia during the post-operative period but can cause acute kidney injury (AKI) when used peri-operatively (at or around the time of surgery). This is an update of a Cochrane review published in 2007.

Objectives

This review looked at the effect of NSAIDs used in the peri-operative period on post-operative kidney function in patients with normal kidney function.

Search Methods

We searched Cochrane Kidney and Transplant's Specialised Register to 4 January 2018 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Specialised Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs (RCTs in which allocation to treatment was obtained by alternation, use of alternate medical records, date of birth or other predictable methods) looking at the use of NSAIDs versus placebo for the treatment of post-operative pain in patients with normal kidney function were included.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data extraction was carried out independently by two authors as was assessment of risk of bias. Disagreements were resolved by a third author. Dichotomous outcomes are reported as relative risk (RR) and continuous outcomes as mean difference (MD) together with their 95% confidence intervals (CI). Meta-analyses were used to assess the outcomes of AKI, change in serum creatinine (SCr), urine output, renal replacement therapy (RRT), death (all causes) and length of hospital stay.

Main Results

We identified 26 studies (8835 participants). Risk of bias was high in 17, unclear in 6and low in three studies. There was high risk of attrition bias in six studies. Only two studies measured AKI. The use of NSAIDs had uncertain effects on the incidence of AKI compared to placebo (7066 participants: RR 1.79, 95% CI 0.40 to 7.96; I² = 59%; very low certainty evidence). One study was stopped early by the data monitoring committee due to increased rates of AKI in the NSAID group. Moreover, both of these studies were examining NSAIDs for indications other than analgesia and therefore utilised relatively low doses. Compared to placebo, NSAIDs may slightly increase serum SCr (15 studies, 794 participants: MD 3.23 μmol/L, 95% CI -0.80 to 7.26; I² = 63%; low certainty evidence). Studies displayed moderate to high heterogeneity and had multiple exclusion criteria including age and so were not representative of patients undergoing surgery. Three of these studies excluded patients if their creatinine rose post-operatively.NSAIDs may make little or no difference to post-operative urine output compared to placebo (6 studies, 149 participants: SMD -0.02, 95% CI -0.31 to 0.27). No reliable conclusions could be drawn from these studies due to the differing units of measurements and measurement time points. It is uncertain whether NSAIDs leads to the need for RRT because the certainty of this evidence is very low (2 studies, 7056 participants: RR 1.57, 95% CI 0.49 to 5.07; I² = 26%); there were few events and the results were inconsistent. It is uncertain whether NSAIDs lead to more deaths (2 studies, 312 participants: RR 1.44, 95% CI 0.19 to 11.12; I² = 38%) or increased the length of hospital stay (3 studies, 410 participants: MD 0.12 days, 95% CI -0.48 to 0.72; I² = 24%).

Authors' Conclusions

Overall NSAIDs had uncertain effects on the risk of post-operative AKI, may slightly increase post-operative SCr, and it is uncertain whether NSAIDs lead to the need for RRT, death or increases the length of hospital stay. The available data therefore does not confirm the safety of NSAIDs in patients undergoing surgery. Further larger studies using the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes definition for AKI including patients with co-morbidities are required to confirm these findings.

### Moving toward a contemporary classification of drug-induced kidney disease [^115ZuQ36]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute kidney injury (AKI) occurs in about 10–15% of hospitalized and more than 50% of intensive care unit (ICU) patients. Severity of acute and chronic illnesses, iatrogenic exposures, and discrepant AKI definitions lead to variability in prevalence estimates across populations and across studies. Still, mortality rates reach up to 65% in the ICU for patients with AKI.

Clinicians and researchers have classified the heterogeneous etiologies of AKI using "pre-renal", "renal/intra-renal", and "post-renal" categories to explain the nature of the kidney insult. However, this approach fails to account for the overlapping and dynamic nature of AKI due to various etiologies including drugs. For example, a patient with AKI in the context of a decreased effective arterial blood volume from over diuresis — referred to as "pre-renal" AKI, can progress to parenchymal damage if this scenario is prolonged for an extended duration or if another drug such as a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) administered in combination during this pre-rental state, subsequently referred to as "intra-renal". Leading consensus groups recommend a more explicit and comprehensive AKI classification based on evidence of kidney dysfunction and/or damage. The 10th and 23rd Acute Disease Quality Initiative (ADQI) working groups proposed the terms "functional AKI" and "kidney damage" instead of "pre-renal", "renal", and "post-renal". This working group also suggested to exploit both functional and damage kidney biomarkers along with non-kidney biomarkers (e.g. natriuretic peptides, procalcitonin) to better define AKI and characterize its etiologies. Furthermore, the 23rd ADQI expert panel suggested to subcategorize KDIGO stage 1 AKI into 3 substages (1S, 1A, and 1B) and stage 2 and 3 individually into 2 substages (2A & 2B and 3A & 3B, respectively) based on the measurement of functional and damage biomarkers.

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and risk of renal disease: Use of non‑selective or COX‑2 selective NSAIDs can result in renal papillary necrosis, acute tubular necrosis, acute interstitial nephritis with or without nephrotic syndrome, renal insufficiency, fluid and electrolyte disturbances, acute renal failure, or other renal‑related injuries in an estimated 1–5% of patients, and all available agents approved for use in the U.S. include a warning for such events in their prescribing information. The risk for renal adverse events increases in patients who are dependent upon a compensatory increase in renal prostaglandins to maintain renal perfusion, and patients at higher risk include those with preexisting renal disease, volume depletion (e.g., diuretics, vomiting), congestive heart failure, liver dysfunction, cirrhosis with ascites, use of angiotensin‑converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers, and older patients. In healthy patients, renal prostaglandins do not play a significant role in maintaining renal perfusion; however, in reduced volume, hypotension, and reduced renal perfusion, NSAID administration reduces compensatory vasodilatory renal prostaglandins, which can result in reduced renal perfusion and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and can lead to renal damage. Although other mechanisms exist, hemodynamically mediated acute renal insufficiency is the most common cause and is most frequently reversible once the offending agent is discontinued. In the PRECISION study, renal events were prospectively monitored in more than 20,000 RA or OA patients receiving celecoxib, ibuprofen, or naproxen for a mean follow‑up of 20 months, and eligible patients had baseline serum creatinine values within normal limits.

### Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug induced acute kidney injury in the community dwelling general population and people with chronic kidney disease: systematic review and meta-analysis [^113wuPZm]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are a common cause of adverse drug events (ADEs), but renal risks of NSAIDs are less well quantified than gastrointestinal and cardiac risks. This paper reports a systematic review of published population-based observational studies examining the risk of acute kidney injury (AKI) associated with NSAIDs in community-dwelling adults and those with pre-existing chronic kidney disease (CKD).

Methods

MEDLINE and EMBASE databases were searched until June 2016, and 3789 papers screened. Ten studies reporting NSAID risk of AKI in the general population were included in random effects meta-analysis, of which five additionally reported NSAID risk in people with CKD.

Results

In the general population, the pooled odds ratio (OR) of AKI for current NSAID exposure was 1.73 (95%CI 1.44 to 2.07), with somewhat higher risk observed in older people (OR 2.51, 95%CI 1.52 to 2.68). In people with CKD, individual study OR of AKI due to current NSAID exposure ranged from 1.12 to 5.25, with pooled estimate OR 1.63 (95% CI 1.22 to 2.19).

Conclusions

No study reported baseline risk of AKI in different populations meaning absolute risks could not be estimated, but baseline risk and therefore the absolute risk of NSAID exposure is likely to be higher in people with CKD and older people. Large population based studies measuring AKI using current definitions and estimating the absolute risk of harm are needed in order to better inform clinical decision making.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the primary care management of chronic kidney disease [^112iWAFa]. DoD/VA (2025). High credibility.

NSAID-induced kidney injury risk in CKD and general populations — observational and meta-analytic data: Observational studies demonstrate that nephrotoxic risks of NSAIDs are modest, somewhat predictable, and may be less than risks associated with alternative medications. Patients at higher risk for acute kidney injury (AKI) include those with heart failure, cirrhosis, CKD, or dehydration, and those on RAASi, diuretics, or calcineurin inhibitors. In non-CKD populations, studies are conflicting, with some finding no association with incident CKD and others showing increased relative risk with risk generally increasing based on intensity or duration of NSAID exposure; although larger recent studies show a consistent trend toward increased incident CKD, the absolute risks are small when reported. One report demonstrated an excess of 17 CKD events per 100,000 exposed Active-Duty U.S. service members. In patients with pre-existing CKD, a meta-analysis supported increased risk of NSAID-associated AKI with HR of 1.7 and an absolute risk of 4% in NSAID exposed versus non-exposed individuals; however, individual trial estimates varied by an order of magnitude (e.g. OR: 1.05 to 5.25), so pooled averages should be interpreted with skepticism.

5.4 Hypotension

PRESTALIA can cause symptomatic hypotension. Symptomatic hypotension is most likely to occur in patients who have been volume- or salt-depleted as a result of prolonged diuretic therapy, dietary salt restriction, dialysis, diarrhea, or vomiting.

In patients at risk of excessive hypotension, start PRESTALIA therapy under close medical supervision. Follow patients closely for the first 2 weeks of treatment and whenever the dose of PRESTALIA is increased or a diuretic is added or its dose increased.

If excessive hypotension occurs, immediately place patient in a supine position and, if necessary, treat patient with an intravenous infusion of physiological saline. PRESTALIA treatment can usually be continued following restoration of volume and blood pressure.

Patients with severe aortic stenosis may be more likely to experience symptomatic hypotension. Because of the gradual onset of action, acute hypotension is unlikely.

Surgery/Anesthesia

In patients undergoing major surgery or during anesthesia with agents that produce hypotension, PRESTALIA may block angiotensin II formation secondary to compensatory renin release. If hypotension occurs and is considered to be due to this mechanism, it can be corrected by volume expansion.

5.5 Hyperkalemia

Elevations of serum potassium have been observed in some patients treated with ACE inhibitors, including PRESTALIA. Risk factors for the development of hyperkalemia include renal insufficiency, diabetes mellitus, and the concomitant use of agents such as potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, and/or potassium-containing salt substitutes [see Drug Interactions (7)].

Monitor serum potassium periodically in patients receiving PRESTALIA.

5.6 Cough

Presumably because of the inhibition of the degradation of endogenous bradykinin, persistent nonproductive cough has been reported with all ACE inhibitors, generally resolving after discontinuation of therapy. Consider ACE inhibitor-induced cough in the differential diagnosis of cough.

5.7 Impaired Renal Function

Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving PRESTALIA. Drugs that affect the renin-angiotensin system can cause reductions in renal function, including acute renal failure. Patients whose renal function may depend in part on the activity of the renin-angiotensin system — (e.g., patients with renal artery stenosis, severe heart failure, post-myocardial infarction or volume depletion) or who are on non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDS) or angiotensin receptor blockers — may be at particular risk of developing acute renal failure on PRESTALIA. Consider withholding or discontinuing therapy in patients who develop a clinically significant decrease in renal function on PRESTALIA.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) route and duration — risk of acute kidney injury (AKI) and hyperkalemia in older adults and patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD): Observational analyses examining the first 30 days after a newly prescribed topical, short course (< 14 days), or longer course NSAID found in older adults that both topical (OR: 1.48) and short-course oral NSAIDs (OR: 1.59) were associated with increased risk at 30 days; a similar analysis reported adjusted odds for AKI or hyperkalemia at 30 days of 1.29 for topical NSAIDs, 1.43 for systemic NSAIDs of < 15 days, and 1.84 for systemic NSAIDs of ≥ 15 days, with incrementally higher odds with oral and prolonged administration. Among patients with CKD, topical and oral NSAIDs (compared with no NSAID prescription) were associated with AKI (OR: 1.38 and 1.77 respectively), and moderate and severe AKI were increased with oral NSAIDs but not topical NSAIDs. While each analysis attempted to control for confounders, it is unclear how much residual confounding by indication remains, and the literature suggests that the risk of adverse kidney outcomes is decreased (but likely not eliminated) by use of topical rather than oral NSAIDs.

### Celecoxib-induced nonoliguric acute renal failure [^113ERLkt]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To report a case of nonoliguric acute renal failure secondary to use of celecoxib in a patient with rheumatoid arthritis.

Case Summary

A 43-year-old Hispanic woman started receiving celecoxib 200 mg/d for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Fourteen days after initiating therapy, she developed nonoliguric acute renal failure. Celecoxib was discontinued. Renal function improved, but had not returned to normal 30 days after presentation.

Discussion

Only 2 cases of reversible oliguric acute renal failure and volume overload have been reported 13 and 14 days after initiating therapy with celecoxib. Renal function in the 2 patients returned to baseline after treatment with diuretics. To our knowledge, the development of nonoliguric acute renal failure secondary to treatment with celecoxib has not previously been reported.

Conclusions

Celecoxib can probably result in reversible, or nonoliguric, acute renal failure. Although renal function improves after discontinuation of celecoxib, it may not return to baseline. Celecoxib should be used cautiously in individuals at risk of developing acute renal failure.

### Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug induced acute kidney injury in the community dwelling general population and people with chronic kidney disease: systematic review and meta-analysis [^111o6Ck2]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

The study strengths include careful study selection and the use of a structured quality assessment tool to ensure that only high quality studies were included. The observed associations were consistent across subgroups, but the study has several limitations. As with all systematic reviews, the findings depend on the quality of the included studies. We chose to review and meta-analyse observational studies because an initial literature search identified that trials of NSAIDs rarely report renal outcomes (the focus of this study) and exclude people with CKD (a key topic of interest) and other comorbidities as well as older people and minority groups. However, observational studies are vulnerable to residual confounding by measured and unmeasured variables. An example is confounding by indication, which in this context is likely to occur if prescribers avoid NSAIDs in people they perceive to be at higher risk of NSAID toxicity including AKI, which would lead to an underestimation of AKI risk if present. There were also large differences between studies in the population examined and the way in which AKI was measured, both of which likely contributed to the observed moderate to large heterogeneity between studies. It is also important to recognise that the estimate of the risk of NSAIDs in the general population is adjusted for potential confounders, but the estimate in people with CKD is not because only one study reported an adjusted estimate. Other limitations include that we only included studies published in English, that there were a relatively small number of studies suitable for inclusion which made meta-regression to explore heterogeneity unfeasible, and that the rate of concomitant use of OTC NSAID use could not be assessed in the populations studied. Seven of the included studies addressed that OCT NSAID use may have caused exposure misclassification. But all of the studies believed that due to reasons such as financial incentives, the proportion of OCT NSAID users is expected to be small and nondifferential with respect to the NSAID categories the populations studied. Consequently, it would bias the results toward the null. As most of the studies confirmed eligible cases then selected controls according to a certain proportion, non-response rate was not given in the majority of the included studies. Since cases and controls of these studies were derived from the same databases, were examined for the same exposure and followed up in the same way, then non-response rate is not considered to be a problem and therefore it is unlikely there would be missing data bias. We were unable to access publication bias because of the extensive statistical heterogeneity. For many of the methodological qualities assessed there was an unclear risk of bias as studies did not provide explicit detail to make an informed judgement.

### Do early non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for analgesia worsen acute kidney injury in critically ill trauma patients? An inverse probability of treatment weighted analysis [^114YPu7g]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Administration of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for acute posttraumatic analgesia is increasing in popularity as an alternative to opioids despite reservations regarding its potential impact on the development of acute kidney injury (AKI). We hypothesized that early NSAID administration for analgesia would be associated with worsened renal function in severely injured trauma patients.

Methods

A retrospective cohort study of severely injured adult (≥ 16 years) patients admitted to the intensive care unit with ≥ 1 rib fracture between 2010 and 2017 was performed. The early NSAID group was defined by receipt of one or more doses of NSAID within the first 48 hours of hospitalization. Acute kidney injury diagnosis and staging were defined by the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes Guidelines. The primary outcome was a composite measure of two outcomes within the first week of hospitalization: (1) AKI progression (increase in AKI stage from arrival) or (2) death. Secondary outcomes included AKI progression, AKI improvement, AKI duration, and mortality. Inverse propensity of treatment weights were generated using clinically sound covariates suspected to be associated with the decision to give early NSAIDs and the primary or secondary outcomes. Multivariable analyses were performed adjusting for inverse propensity of treatment weights, covariates, and length of stay.

Results

Of 2,340 patients, 268 (11%) were administered early NSAIDs. When compared with the control group, patients who received early NSAIDs were less severely injured. Renal outcomes were worse in the control group. Standardized mean differences were minimal after weighting. On multivariable analysis, administration of early NSAIDs was not associated with worsened renal outcomes or increased mortality.

Conclusion

Although only 11% of patients received early NSAIDs after trauma for analgesia, early NSAID exposure was not associated with increased AKI progression, decreased AKI improvement, prolonged duration, or increased mortality. Given the lack of evidence showing harm, early NSAIDs for analgesia may be underused for severely injured patients.

### Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are an important cause of acute kidney injury in children [^115ZpuPW]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To characterize nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)-associated acute kidney injury (AKI) in children.

Study Design

We conducted a retrospective chart review of children diagnosed with AKI through the use of International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision diagnosis code 584.5 or 584.9 from January 1999 to June 2010. Medical records were reviewed to confirm the diagnosis of AKI and to quantify NSAID administration. Pediatric RIFLE criteria were used to codify AKI. Patients were not classified as having NSAID-associated AKI if they had a diagnosis explaining AKI or comorbid clinical conditions predisposing to AKI development.

Results

Patients (N = 1015) were identified through International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision screening. Twenty-one children had clinical, laboratory, and radiographic studies suggesting NSAID-associated acute tubular necrosis and 6 had findings suggesting NSAID-associated acute interstitial nephritis, representing 2.7% (27 of 1015) of the total cohort with AKI and 6.6% when excluding complex patients with multifactorial AKI. Children with NSAID-associated AKI had a median (range) age of 14.7 years (0.5–17.7 years); 4 patients (15%) were < 5 years old. Fifteen of 20 children (75%) for whom dosing data were available received NSAIDs within recommended dosing limits. Patients < 5 years old were more likely to require dialysis (100% vs 0%, P < .001), intensive care unit admission (75% vs 9%, P = 0.013), and a longer length of stay (median 10 vs 7 days, P = 0.037).

Conclusions

NSAID-associated AKI accounted for 2.7% of AKI in this pediatric population. AKI typically occurred after the administration of correctly dosed NSAIDs. Young children with NSAID-associated AKI may have increased disease severity.

### Geriatric trauma management [^115p1N8c]. ACS (2023). High credibility.

Acute kidney injury in geriatric trauma — evaluation and medication guidance emphasizes that acute loss of kidney function is common in geriatric trauma patients and that two common classifications of AKI are the RIFLE (Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss, End-stage) and AKIN (Acute Kidney Injury Network) criteria. Promptly evaluate the older adult to identify reversible causes, change medication doses, and initiate discussions about RRT, and promptly evaluate the patient with acute kidney failure to identify reversible causes, change medication doses, and initiate discussions about renal replacement therapy (RRT). Urine electrolytes can help distinguish between prerenal and intrinsic renal causes of AKI, and once the AKI diagnosis is established, medications and doses are selected in consultation with pharmacists. Avoid nephrotoxic medications, or follow therapeutic levels in cases of fluctuating renal function, and carefully consider the risks and benefits of nephrotoxic medications such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), high-dose loop diuretics, and aminoglycosides.

### Nonselective and cyclooxygenase-2-selective NSAIDs and acute kidney injury [^116rTJzw]. The American Journal of Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

The association between nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and acute kidney injury is well established, but it is less clear whether this risk is focused with specific agents. We undertook a large pharmacoepidemiologic analysis of the risk of acute kidney injury among older adults using nonselective NSAIDs or cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitors.

Methods

Medicare beneficiaries from 2 large states with drug benefit were eligible for study. Patients were included if they filled a prescription for a nonselective NSAID or COX-2 inhibitor after more than 6 months without any such prescriptions and without a previous diagnosis of acute kidney injury. Incident acute kidney injury was ascertained from hospitalization claims within 45 days of initiating nonselective NSAID or COX-2 inhibitor therapy. Adjusted proportional hazards models estimated the relative risk of acute kidney injury associated with each agent compared with celecoxib.

Results

We included 183,446 patients whose mean age was 78 years; 80% were women. Acute kidney injury was identified in 870 (0.47%) of nonselective NSAID or COX-2 inhibitor users. The agents with significantly elevated risk compared with celecoxib were indomethacin (rate ratio [RR] = 2.23; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.70–2.93), ibuprofen (RR = 1.73; 95% CI, 1.36–2.19), and rofecoxib (RR = 1.52; 95% CI, 1.26–1.83). These findings were robust in several subgroups.

Conclusion

Acute kidney injury requiring hospitalization is a relatively rare adverse event among older adults after initiation of nonselective NSAIDs or COX-2 inhibitor treatment, observed in approximately 1 in 200 new users within 45 days. There seems to be a marked gradient of risk for acute kidney injury across agents, specifically for indomethacin, ibuprofen, and rofecoxib.

### American Society of Hematology 2020 guidelines for sickle cell disease: management of acute and chronic pain [^115vfRkF]. Blood Advances (2020). High credibility.

Nonopioid pharmacological therapy for acute sickle cell disease (SCD) pain — For adults and children presenting with acute pain related to SCD, the ASH guideline panel suggests a short course (5 to 7 days) of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in addition to opioids for acute pain management (conditional recommendation based on very low certainty in the evidence about effects ⊕◯◯◯). NSAIDs are defined broadly to include selective and nonselective cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitors, and patient-specific assessment of harms should guide use and drug/class selection; patients at increased risk of renal toxicity should be identified, and if comorbidities confer significant risk, the mild potential benefit may not outweigh the risk. It is good practice to provide patient-centered education and surveillance related to NSAID toxicity, especially in patients with end-organ comorbidities, given limited long-term safety data and potential vascular, bleeding, and renal risks.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the primary care management of chronic kidney disease [^11366CiG]. DoD/VA (2025). High credibility.

NSAID safety in chronic kidney disease (CKD) emphasizes that concomitant use of multiple agents that affect kidney hemodynamics (e.g. RAASi, diuretics, SGLT2i, finerenone) as well as volume depletion may further increase the risk of NSAID-induced AKI; consider increasing frequency of eGFR monitoring with NSAID use, especially if prolonged or high-dose. Risks of NSAIDs are likely to outweigh benefits where there is evidence of little to no benefit (e.g., chronic primary musculoskeletal or wide-spread pain syndromes); determine meaningful functional targets for the patient, using SDM, prior to a trial of NSAID therapy, and proactively educate the patients on risks of NSAIDs, both OTC and prescribed, noting that patients may use OTC NSAIDs without discussion with a provider.

### AGA clinical practice update on the evaluation and management of acute kidney injury in patients with cirrhosis: expert review [^1157JGo4]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Description

The purpose of this American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) Institute Clinical Practice Update is to review the available published evidence and expert advice regarding the clinical management of patients with suspected acute kidney injury in patients with cirrhosis.

Methods

This article provides practical advice for the management of patients with cirrhosis and acute kidney injury based on the best available published evidence. This best practice document is not based on a formal systematic review. This expert review was commissioned and approved by the AGA Institute Clinical Practice Updates Committee and the AGA Governing Board to provide timely guidance on a topic of high clinical importance to the AGA membership and underwent internal peer review by the Clinical Practice Updates Committee and external peer review through the standard procedures of Clinical Gastroenterology & Hepatology. These Best Practice Advice (BPA) statements were drawn from a review of the published literature and from expert opinion. Since systematic reviews were not performed, these BPA statements do not carry formal ratings of the quality of evidence or strength of the presented considerations. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 1: Acute kidney injury (AKI) should be diagnosed when the serum creatinine increases by ≥ 0.3 mg/dL within 48 hours or is ≥ 50% from baseline or when the urine output is reduced below 0.5 mL/kg/h for > 6 hours. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 2: Preventive measures against the development of AKI in cirrhosis include (1) avoidance of potentially nephrotoxic medications like nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), (2) avoidance of excessive or unmonitored diuretics or nonselective beta-blockade, (3) avoidance of large-volume paracentesis without albumin replacement, and (4) counseling patients to avoid alcohol use. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 3: (A) Investigation is directed to determining the cause of AKI, which can be due to hypovolemic causes (volume responsive, and the most common cause of AKI in patients with cirrhosis); acute tubular necrosis; hepatorenal syndrome with AKI (HRS-AKI) (a functional renal failure that persists despite volume repletion); HRS with acute kidney disease, a type of functional renal failure of < 3 months- duration in which criteria for HRS-AKI are not met; or postrenal, which occurs only rarely. (B) The specific type of AKI should be identified through a careful history, physical examination, blood biochemistry, urine microscopic examination, urine chemistry (Na+ and urea) and selected urinary biomarkers, and renal ultrasound. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 4: A rigorous search for infection is required in all patients with AKI. A diagnostic paracentesis should be carried out to evaluate for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis; blood and urine cultures and chest radiograph are also required. There is no role for routine prophylactic antibiotics in patients with AKI, but broad-spectrum antibiotics should be started whenever infection is strongly suspected. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 5: When AKI is diagnosed, diuretics and nonselective beta-blockers should be held, NSAIDs discontinued, the precipitating cause of AKI treated, and fluid losses replaced, administering albumin 1 g/kg/d for 2 days if the serum creatinine shows doubling from baseline. Urine output, vital signs, and when indicated, echocardiography or CVP (if there is a pre-existing central line) should be used to monitor fluid status. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 6: When the serum creatinine remains higher than twice the baseline value despite these measures, treatment of HRS-AKI should be initiated with albumin at a dose of 1 g/kg intravenously on day 1 followed by 20–40 g daily along with vasoactive agents (terlipressin; if terlipressin is not available, either a combination of octreotide and midodrine; or norepinephrine, depending on institutional preferences) and continued either until 24 hours following the return of the serum creatinine level to within ≤ 0.3 mg/dL of baseline for 2 consecutive days or for a total of 14 days of therapy. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 7: Terlipressin should be initiated as a bolus dose of 1 mg every 4–6 hours (total 4–6 mg/d). The dose should be increased to a maximum of 2 mg every 4–6 hours (total 8–12 mg/d) if there is no reduction in serum creatinine at day 3 of therapy by at least 25% compared to the baseline value. Alternatively, clinicians can administer terlipressin by continuous intravenous infusion at a lower starting dose of 2 mg/d, which may reduce ischemic side effects and increase the dose gradually every 24–48 hours up to a maximum dose of 12 mg/d, or reversal of HRS. As per Food and Drug Administration restrictions, terlipressin should not be used in patients with a serum creatinine ≥ 5 mg/dL, or oxygen saturation of < 90%. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 8: Oral midodrine when used should be initiated at doses of 7.5 mg and titrated upward to 12.5 mg 3 times daily with octreotide (starting with 100 μg and titrating upward to 200 μg subcutaneously 3 times daily). BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 9: Norepinephrine should be used as a continuous intravenous infusion at a starting dose of 0.5 mg/h and the dose increased every 4 hours by 0.5 mg/h to a maximum of 3 mg/h with the goal of increasing the mean arterial pressure by ≥ 10 mm Hg and/or the urine output to > 50 mL/h for at least 4 hours. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 10: The risks of ischemic side effects of terlipressin and norepinephrine include angina and ischemia of fingers, skin, and intestine. These side effects may be lowered by starting at the lowest dose and gradually titrating upward. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 11: Fluid status should be closely monitored because of the risk of pulmonary edema with excessive use of albumin. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 12: Renal replacement therapy (RRT) may be used in the management of (A) AKI secondary to acute tubular necrosis; (B) HRS-AKI in potential candidates for liver transplantation (that is, RRT should not be used in patients with HRS-AKI who are not candidates for liver transplantation); and (C) AKI of uncertain etiology in which the need for RRT may be considered on an individual basis. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 13: Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunts should not be used as a specific treatment of HRS-AKI. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 14: Liver transplantation is the most effective treatment for HRS-AKI. Pharmacotherapy for HRS-AKI before proceeding with liver transplantation may be associated with better post-liver transplantation outcomes. Selected patients with HRS-AKI may require simultaneous liver kidney transplantation based on updated Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network listing criteria.

### Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [^113Aqgkz]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, including COX-2 selective drugs, are often used for acute and chronic musculoskeletal pain, including osteoarthritis, trauma, overuse syndromes, and compression fractures. Although these medications are often well tolerated in the young and otherwise healthy patient, the chronic use of these medications can lead to multiple medical problems, most commonly related to the gastrointestinal tract. Recently, concerns about cardiovascular adverse effects have been raised, particularly in the COX-2 drugs. Dosing and duration of therapy should be adjusted for comorbidities. CBC and renal and hepatic function should be checked at intervals of 3 to 6 months, depending on the patient.

### COX-2 inhibitors and the kidney [^117JAGGv]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2001). Low credibility.

Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) selective inhibitors are now extensively used for their anti-inflammatory and analgesic efficacy. Several large controlled trials provide evidence to support the proposition that they cause fewer major gastro-intestinal side effects and less toxicity than routine nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). In view of the documented different localizations of the cyclooxygenase-1 and COX-2 enzymes in the kidney, it was initially hoped that COX-2 inhibitors would be associated with fewer renal side effects than other NSAIDs. This has not been borne out by subsequent studies. Like other NSAIDs, COX-2 inhibitors can cause salt and water retention, leading to edema and worsening hypertension. They can also cause acute declines in renal function and glomerular filtration rate. These events are, however, uncommon in large rheumatology populations and infrequently lead to discontinuation of the medications. Judicious use of COX-2 inhibitors in high-risk patients (such as those with chronic renal insufficiency, diabetes or congestive heart failure) will lead to a decreased incidence of adverse renal events.

### Treatment of acute gout in hospitalized patients [^114MEaE1]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To record practice patterns of treatment of acute gout in hospitalized patients.

Methods

We performed a retrospective chart review of hospitalized patients diagnosed with gout.

Results

Seventy-nine (43%) patients were diagnosed with acute gout during their hospitalization. Fifty-eight (73%) patients with acute gout were found to have a reduction in their glomerular filtration rate. Twenty patients (25%) underwent arthrocentesis. The most widely used drugs for acute gout were colchicine, n = 42 (53%), and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAID), n = 40 (51%). Combination therapy was used in 52% of patients with acute gout. Thiry-six (86%) patients treated with colchicine and 32 (80%) patients treated with NSAID had renal failure.

Discussion

Crystal analysis, the gold standard for diagnosing gout, was performed in only 25% of patients suspected of acute gout. Combination antiinflammatory agents are used in over 50% of patients despite the absence of evidence to support use of such combinations. Renal failure was present in 73% of patients with acute gout. Colchicine and NSAID should therefore be used with caution in these patients. Practice patterns vary widely and often appear to be in conflict with recommended diagnostic and treatment measures for acute gout.

Additionally, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers can lead to a "functional" AKI (defined as an increase in serum creatinine). The prospective Translational Research Investigating Biomarker Endpoints for Acute Kidney Injury (TRIBE-AKI) study demonstrated that the graded increase in functional AKI (continued angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blocker greater than held angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blocker greater than no angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blocker use) was not accompanied by "structural" AKI (no difference in AKI risk between the three exposure groups, as assessed by four different urinary biomarkers for AKI). The results of a study can be dramatically altered based upon how AKI is defined (serum creatinine changes vs. biomarkers), and this discrepancy may be especially pronounced in patients on angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers. This study demonstrates that a rise in serum creatinine is not always accompanied by tissue damage (and tissue damage does not always result in rising serum creatinine, i.e. subclinical AKI), highlighting one of the major limitations of serum creatinine as a biomarker.

Management of NSAIDs

NSAIDs have been used to effectively mitigate postoperative pain while decreasing the opioid requirement.NSAIDs can adversely affect renal via prostaglandin mediated afferent arteriolar dilation, which causes reduced glomerular perfusion, leading to acute interstitial nephritis. Drug-associated acute interstitial nephritis presents a cell-mediated immune response, characterized by acute loss of kidney function, interstitial infiltrates, edema, and tubulitis on biopsy (with relative sparing of glomerulus and vasculature). Because of this risk, the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (London, United Kingdom) has recommend that NSAIDs be avoided in hypovolemic patients; however, best practices in low-risk patients remain unresolved. A 2018 meta-analysis found that although NSAIDs led to a slight increase in serum creatinine, this was of unclear clinical significance, and no reliable conclusions could be drawn regarding the association between NSAIDs and renal replacement therapy, hospital length of stay, or death. A secondary analysis of data from the Restrictive versus Liberal Fluid Therapy in Major Abdominal Surgery (RELIEF) trial found that intraoperative NSAID or cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor use was significantly associated with increased postoperative AKI, supporting the need for a randomized trial to better define the risk–benefit balance of these perioperative analgesic adjuncts. Emerging proteomic research sheds light on the molecular pathways, specifically differences in prostaglandin synthesis, driving NSAID-attributed AKI in the perioperative space.

Guidance statement — once AKI is diagnosed, an investigation to uncover and treat precipitating factors must be conducted swiftly, with relevant risk factors including fluid losses, bacterial infections, hemodynamic instability, and potentially nephrotoxic agents (particularly nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs); hypovolemia-induced AKI should be managed with fluid replacement therapy, correction of the cause that led to volume depletion, and diuretic withdrawal; and the differential diagnosis of AKI, HRS, and ATN is challenging and should follow the consensus criteria presented in the algorithm in Fig. 4.

We therefore used data on the total active-duty US Army to estimate the independent associations between prescribed oral NSAID use and incident acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Renal effects of NSAIDs have been shown to be dose dependent. Increased frequency and duration of NSAID use amplify the risk of nonrenal adverse effects. Accordingly, we devised methods to study NSAID exposure volume over time while controlling for major factors of potential relevance to kidney dysfunction.

### Perioperative acute kidney injury: diagnosis, prediction, prevention, and treatment [^114VbWBx]. Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Pathophysiology

AKI represents a clinical syndrome, rather than a single disease, with most cases being multifactorial. Commonly implicated mechanisms include (1) oxido-inflammatory stress (for example, hyperoxia or glyco-oxidative injury), (2) renal hypoperfusion (for example, hypotension or anemia), (3) endogenous or exogenous nephrotoxins, and (4) iatrogenic causes (fig. 1). Venous congestion has also been associated with postoperative AKI through multiple potential mechanisms including (1) hypoperfusion, (2) inflammation, (3) oxidative stress, (4) endothelial activation, and (5) sympathetic activation. Administration of nephrotoxic drugs and the need for intravenous contrast also place surgical patients at risk for acute interstitial nephritis and acute tubular damage. Prerenal etiologies, like true volume depletion and volume dysregulation secondary to congestive heart failure, and acute tubular injury from a myriad of insults including nephrotoxic drugs and intravenous contrast, are common mechanisms in the postoperative setting. The surgical environment also introduces the possibility of iatrogenic injury. Examples include ureteral damage in an intraabdominal surgery and emboli from vascular procedures.

### The growth of acute kidney injury: a rising tide or just closer attention to detail? [^111ubfKG]. Kidney International (2015). Low credibility.

Even outside of hospitalization, an increasing spectrum of medications commonly administered in a chronic stable setting is becoming recognized for their nephrotoxic potential (Table 5). Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug exposure, in particular, continues to be problematic in patients at risk for AKI, including those with hypertension, congestive heart failure, and CKD, and it is one of the five areas recently identified by the American Society of Nephrology Quality and Patient Safety Task Force 'most open' to improvement. In addition to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, proton-pump inhibitors and phosphate-based purgatives have been implicated in AKI, many of which do not require a prescription and therefore more difficult to study.

Aside from an increasing variety of nephrotoxic medications, growth in AKI over the past two decades has also occurred on a background of increasingly aggressive blood pressure control. This is particularly true among patients with CKD, the group identified to be at the highest risk for developing AKI. Peralta et al. observed that nearly one-third of hypertensive patients with CKD were on ⩾3 antihypertensive drugs, including 50% on diuretics and 58% on renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibition. Increasing efforts to improve blood pressure control typically increases the number of medications prescribed, leading to a wider pulse pressure and a lowering of diastolic blood pressure. Even in the absence of frank hypotension, a fall in blood pressure in patients with impaired renal autoregulation, particularly those with CKD, hypertension, and the elderly, may lead to increased risk of AKI.

### Ibuprofen [^116gxEiw]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

To minimize the potential risk for an adverse GI event in patients treated with an NSAID, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest possible duration. Patients and physicians should remain alert for signs and symptoms of GI ulcerations and bleeding during NSAID therapy and promptly initiate additional evaluation and treatment if a serious GI event is suspected. This should include discontinuation of the NSAID until a serious GI adverse event is ruled out. For high-risk patients, alternate therapies that do not involve NSAIDs should be considered.

Renal Effects

Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury. Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of a NSAID may cause a dose-dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation. Patients at greatest risk of this reaction are those with impaired renal function, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics and ACE inhibitors, and the elderly. Discontinuation of NSAID therapy is usually followed by recovery to the pretreatment state.

Advanced Renal Disease

No information is available from controlled clinical studies regarding the use of ibuprofen tablets in patients with advanced renal disease. Therefore, treatment with ibuprofen tablets is not recommended in these patients with advanced renal disease. If ibuprofen tablet therapy must be initiated, close monitoring of the patients renal function is advisable.

### Acute renal failure [^115gJ5Rn]. Lancet (2005). Excellent credibility.

This seminar covers the most recent information on definition, epidemiology, and clinical causes of acute renal failure. The mechanisms of acute prerenal failure and the potential interference by commonly used drugs of autoregulation of renal blood flow are discussed. We summarise some basic and recent insights into the haemodynamic and cellular pathophysiological mechanisms, mainly of postischaemic acute renal failure. Recent findings on the repair mechanisms of renal injury and the potential future therapeutic possibilities are discussed. We provide some differential diagnostic approaches for patients with acute renal failure and summarise prevention of the disorder and management of critically ill patients by dialysis and by other means. Finally, some information on the influence of gene polymorphisms on the prognosis of acute renal failure is given.

### Ketoprofen [^111mC2NP]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

NSAIDs should be prescribed with extreme caution in those with a prior history of ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding. Patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or gastrointestinal bleeding who use NSAIDs have a greater than 10 fold increased risk for developing a GI bleed compared to patients with neither of these risk factors. Other factors that increase the risk for GI bleeding in patients treated with NSAIDs include concomitant use of oral corticosteroids or anticoagulants, longer duration of NSAID therapy, smoking, use of alcohol, older age, and poor general health status. Most spontaneous reports of fatal GI events are in elderly or debilitated patients and therefore, special care should be taken in treating this population.

To minimize the potential risk for an adverse GI event in patients treated with an NSAID, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest possible duration. Patients and physicians should remain alert for signs and symptoms of GI ulceration and bleeding during NSAID therapy and promptly initiate additional evaluation and treatment if a serious GI adverse event is suspected. This should include discontinuation of the NSAID until a serious GI adverse event is ruled out. Forhigh risk patients, alternate therapies that do not involve NSAIDs should be considered.

Renal Effects

Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury. Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug may cause a dose-dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation. Patients at greater risk of this reaction are those with impaired renal function, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics and ACE-inhibitors, and the elderly. Discontinuation of NSAID therapy is usually followed by recovery to the pretreatment state.

### Acute renal failure… [^11447zAy]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

In acute renal failure, the glomerular filtration rate decreases over days to weeks. As a result, excretion of nitrogenous waste is reduced, and fluid and electrolyte balances cannot be maintained. Patients with acute renal failure are often asymptomatic, and the condition is diagnosed by observed elevations of blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine levels. Most authorities define the condition as an acute increase of the serum creatinine level from baseline. 3 Complete renal shutdown is present when the serum creatinine level rises by at least 0. 5 mg per dL per day and the urine output is less than 400 mL per day. The primary agents that cause prerenal acute renal failure are angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. The inhibition of ACE prevents the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, leading to decreased levels of angiotensin II.

Angiotensin II increases the glomerular filtration rate by causing constriction of the efferent arteriole; its absence decreases the glomerular filtration rate because of dilatation of the efferent arteriole. In certain patients, the glomerular filtration rate is particularly dependent on the effects of angiotensin II. If these patients take an ACE inhibitor, their glomerular filtration rate decreases, and pre-renal acute renal failure can develop. Potassium, BUN and creatinine levels should be obtained soon after patients start taking an ACE inhibitor. NSAIDs cause prerenal acute renal failure by blocking prostaglandin production, which also alters local glomerular arteriolar perfusion. Between 20 and 60 percent of patients require short-term dialysis, particularly when the BUN exceeds 100 mg per dL and the serum creatinine level exceeds the range of 5 to 10 mg per dL.

Indications for dialysis include acidosis or electrolyte disturbances that do not respond to pharmacologic therapy, fluid overload that does not respond to diuretics, and uremia. In patients with progressive acute renal failure, urgent consultation with a nephrologist is indicated.

Oliguria and anuria

Patients may present with a new onset of acute kidney injury (AKI). They may report oliguria, abdominal pain, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, dysuria, hematuria, and lower extremity edema. The incidence of AKI after LVAD implantation has been reported to range from 7 to 56%, with the large variation in range likely due to differing definitions for AKI, the extent of heart failure, and the severity of preexisting kidney disease. Most patients have improved kidney function after device implantation. The mortality rate is high for those patients who develop AKI after LVAD implantation.

Figure 6 shows the possible causes of AKI in patients who have an LVAD. Poor forward flow due to device malfunction or LV dysfunction, as well as pigment nephropathy from hemolysis, is important in the process of differential diagnosis. The diagnostic approach to AKI is also summarized in Fig. 6. Patients who do not improve after optimizing hemodynamic parameters and volume status may need renal replacement therapy. Criteria for renal replacement therapy are the same for patients with or without LVADs, i.e. acidosis, electrolyte imbalance (hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia), fluid overload, and uremic encephalopathy and pericarditis. Emergency dialysis will require temporary catheter placement. For long-term hemodialysis, arteriovenous graft placement is preferred to avoid the high risk of infection associated with central venous catheters. Although there are no studies that describe maturation of arteriovenous fistulas in patients with LVADs, theoretical considerations of nonpulsatile flow have led authors to believe that an arteriovenous fistula should not be considered a vascular access option. Peritoneal dialysis can also be used with the newer VADs, which are implanted in the precordial space or preperitoneal space behind the rectus sheath. Doppler audible ultrasonography should be used to assess arteriovenous-graft patency.

Results

Study flow and characteristics

Electronic searches retrieved 4629 citations, with 3789 unique citations screened and four studies identified from other sources (Fig. 1). After title and abstract screening 30 full-text studies were reviewed of which 10 studies published between 1990 and 2012 met the inclusion and quality criteria and were included (details for excluding were recorded in Additional file 3). All 10 studies examined NSAID-associated AKI risk in the general population with a total of 1,609,163 participants. Five of these studies also provided data in the subset of people with CKD. Eighty percent of studies were rated with seven or more stars out of a possible nine on the Newcastle-Ottawa quality assessment scale (Table 1). Hence the quality of the included studies was considered to be medium to high.

Fig. 1
Flow diagram of the identification process for eligible studies

In all included studies, eligible cases with AKI were recruited in a defined catchment area over a defined period of time, the ascertainment of exposure was through secure electronic records and the same method of ascertainment was used among cases and controls. Eighty percent of the included studies had independent validation of cases while the remaining 20% relied on record linkage alone (ICD codes in database) with no reference to the primary record. One study used hospital controls as their cases were people with community exposure to NSAIDs admitted to hospital with AKI. Two studies used a mixture of hospitalized and community controls. The other included studies selected controls from community or reported hospital and community controls separately in which case only comparisons with community controls were included. The history of outcome occurrence in cases and controls were adequate in 90% of the studies. Two included studies did not match for age and other factors among cases and controls while one of them adjusted for a list of confounders including sex and use of prescription of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) in current use of any NSAID.

### The 6R's of drug induced nephrotoxicity [^114Z8zmx]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Recognition

Currently, there is no standard definition of DIKD and incidence of nephrotoxicity varies depending on the definition employed and the causal drug. The most common drugs that cause DIKD include antibiotics, anti-rejection medications, antiviral agents, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, anti-ulcer agents and chemotherapy.

Most studies have defined nephrotoxicity as 0.5 mg/dL or 50% rise in Scr over 24–72 h time frame and a minimum 24–48 h of drug exposure. However, these definitions pose challenges since a 50% increase in Scr may not have high specificity for DIKD since the underlying disease being treated as well as other AKI risk factors could be significant to the attribution of risk. In the setting of fluctuating renal function or those patients receiving renal replacement therapies, it is difficult to recognize DIKD. For example, if a critically ill patient develops AKI from sepsis, it may be difficult to recognize whether an antibiotic is causing additional injury to the susceptible kidney. Recognition is also complicated by the fact that the mechanism of kidney injury and time period for onset of injury varies by drug and some drugs cause injury by more than one mechanism. For instance, NSAIDS can result in AKI due to hemodynamic changes or acute interstitial nephritis (AIN), or nephrotic range proteinuria from glomerular injury.

In order to improve the recognition of DIKD in the literature, we convened an expert panel to develop consensus-based definitions. We propose that DIKD presents in one of four phenotypes: AKI, glomerular disorder, tubular disorder, or nephrolithiasis/crystalluria. The clinical presentation of each phenotype is based on primary and secondary criteria. We suggest that at least one primary criterion must be met for all drugs suspected of causing DIKD. For each phenotype definition, the following critical elements from the Bradford-Hill causal criteria must be met:
The drug exposure must be at least 24 h preceding the event.
There should be biological plausibility for the causal drug, based on known mechanism of drug effect; metabolism and immunogenicity.
Complete data (including but not limited to co-morbidities, additional nephrotoxic exposures, exposure to contrast agents, surgical procedures, blood pressure, urine output) surrounding the period of drug exposure is required to account for concomitant risks and exposures to other nephrotoxic agents.
The strength of the relationship between the attributable drug and phenotype should be based on drug exposure duration, extent of primary and secondary criteria met and the time course of the injury.

Results

In the primary model, 854 cases of renal disease were matched to 3,289 controls. Of the 854 cases, 727 (85.1%) were matched to four controls, while the remaining 127 (14.9%) were matched to three controls. As Table 2 shows, most of the identified renal disease diagnoses were for acute renal insufficiency and acute renal failure. Cases were more likely to use a PPI and were considerably sicker, higher prevalence chronic diseases, (Table 3) than controls. Renal disease was positively associated with PPI use (OR = 2.04; CI 1.53, 2.71) even after controlling for potential confounding conditions (Table 4). Given the incidence in this population (0.0046), the number needed to harm equals 303 patients.

### A randomized clinical trial assessing the effect of automated medication-targeted alerts on acute kidney injury outcomes [^111LxZK4]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Acute kidney injury (AKI) — an abrupt decline in kidney function — is a major cause of morbidity and mortality among hospitalized patients, associated with an increased hospital length of stay and a 10-fold increase in inpatient mortality –. AKI also carries an independent risk for development of chronic kidney disease (CKD), end stage kidney disease, and death –.

Despite current international best practice guidelines for management of AKI focusing on avoidance of nephrotoxic exposures, studies have shown that AKI, often asymptomatic in presentation, frequently goes unnoticed, and appropriate workup and treatment is inconsistently performed –. For example, a retrospective study of 9534 hospitalized patients with severe AKI found that the rate of discontinuation of potentially nephrotoxic medications is low in the early stages of AKI, revealing an opportunity for early intervention that could potentially prevent progression to more severe forms of AKI.

Medications that affect kidney function are common contributors to AKI in hospitalized patients. However, international guidelines vary with respect to discontinuation of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors (RAASi), and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). Observational studies have shown that NSAIDs, potentially by increasing kidney vasoconstriction, increase the risk of AKI both in and out of the hospital –. International guidelines strongly recommend the discontinuation of NSAIDs in the context of AKI. RAASi lower hydrostatic pressure at the glomerulus, thus decreasing the glomerular filtration rate and inhibiting the clearance of uremic toxins. Interestingly, RAASi may also increase kidney peritubular blood flow, potentially protecting against ischemic damage. There is thus debate regarding the utility of RAASi discontinuation during AKI, and this is reflected in guideline recommendations to "consider" discontinuation. PPIs have long been associated with the development of acute interstitial nephritis (AIN), a form of AKI, and have been linked to the progression of CKD –. As AIN is likely underdiagnosed in hospitalized patients, and PPIs are likely overprescribed, there is significant interest in whether empiric discontinuation of PPI would affect the course of AKI in this population –. To date, international guidelines do not address empiric discontinuation of PPI among patients with AKI. The EL ectronic A lerts for AK I A melioration 2 (ELAIA-2) investigators set out to evaluate the aggregate and individual effect of prompting discontinuation of NSAID, RAASi, and PPI within a single trial framework to provide higher quality evidence to clinicians caring for patients with AKI exposed to these agents.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of low back pain [^115UFoXf]. DoD/VA (2022). High credibility.

VA/DoD low back pain — NSAID selection and safety — Most comparative trials between NSAIDs showed no significant differences in pain relief, and an SR comparing cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) NSAIDs with traditional NSAIDs reported no statistically significant difference for pain relief for acute low back pain in four studies and no differences for chronic LBP in a fifth. A large noninferiority trial randomized 24,081 patients to celecoxib, naproxen, or ibuprofen and found the cardiovascular (CV) risk associated with celecoxib was noninferior to the non-selective NSAIDs; limitations included drug discontinuation 68.8%, study dropout 27.4%, most patients 90% had OA, and a dose of celecoxib limited to 200 mg/day with dose escalation allowed for ibuprofen and naproxen. All NSAIDs have a black box warning for increased risk of CV and gastrointestinal (GI) events; if an NSAID is required in a patient with CV risk, naproxen may be a viable option; the use of relatively selective COX-2 inhibitors reduces the risk for GI events, but this benefit is negated if the patient is using aspirin; NSAIDs can also exacerbate heart failure and worsen hypertension and renal function and must be used cautiously or avoided in patients with renal impairment or in elderly patients.

### High prevalence of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug use among acute kidney injury survivors in the Southern community cohort study [^115ZAQht]. BMC Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusion

In summary, regular NSAID use is common (20%) among socioeconomically disadvantaged AKI survivors. The high prevalence of an avoidable risk factor in a group at high risk for both kidney and cardiovascular events is concerning and underscores the need to better understand the association between NSAID use in this population and future adverse events and in whom the risks are highest, as well as the reasons for use and effective strategies to improve education and awareness among physicians, patients and caregivers.

### Adverse renal effects of anti-inflammatory agents: evaluation of selective and nonselective cyclooxygenase inhibitors [^112RT61P]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Conventional nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), i.e. nonselective cyclooxygenase COX inhibitors have well-documented nephrotoxicity. Adverse renal effects occur because of inhibition of the synthesis of cyclooxygenase-derived prostaglandins which act to modulate pathologic processes that would normally impair various renal functions. The introduction of the selective COX-2 inhibitors raised hope that this class of drugs would reduce injury in both the gastrointestinal tract and the kidneys. Animal and human data, however, suggest that COX-2 synthesized prostaglandins are important in the modulation of renal physiology during adverse conditions. Hence, it appears that these drugs are equal in causing nephrotoxicity as the nonselective COX inhibitors.

### Ibuprofen (Ibupak) [^111vcHjj]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

To minimize the potential risk for an adverse GI event in patients treated with an NSAID, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest possible duration. Patients and physicians should remain alert for signs and symptoms of GI ulcerations and bleeding during NSAID therapy and promptly initiate additional evaluation and treatment if a serious GI event is suspected. This should include discontinuation of the NSAID until a serious GI adverse event is ruled out. For high-risk patients, alternate therapies that do not involve NSAIDs should be considered.

Renal Effects

Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury. Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of an NSAID may cause a dose-dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation. Patients at greatest risk of this reaction are those with impaired renal function, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics and ACE inhibitors, and the elderly. Discontinuation of NSAID therapy is usually followed by recovery to the pretreatment state.

Advanced Renal Disease

No information is available from controlled clinical studies regarding the use of ibuprofen tablets in patients with advanced renal disease. Therefore, treatment with ibuprofen tablets is not recommended in these patients with advanced renal disease. If ibuprofen tablet therapy must be initiated, close monitoring of the patients renal function is advisable.

### Concurrent use of diuretics, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor blockers with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and risk of acute kidney injury: nested case-control study [^115TMwq1]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Conclusions and policy implications

Acute kidney injury is a major public health concern, which has been associated with a mortality rate exceeding 50%. Although the prevalence of cardiovascular diseases has been on the rise in Western countries, the proper use of antihypertensive drugs has been shown to have a favourable effect in preventing major cardiovascular events. However, the use of such therapies might be concurrent with chronic (for example, arthritis) and acute (for example, flu and flu-like syndromes) inflammatory diseases that require anti-inflammatory or analgesic drug treatment. Given that NSAIDs are widely used (40–60% as lifetime prevalence in the general population) and that a greater incidence rate of acute kidney injury was estimated among antihypertensive drugs users than in the general population, increased vigilance may be warranted when diuretics and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers are used concurrently with NSAIDs. In particular, major attention should be paid early in the course of treatment, and a more appropriate use and choice among the available anti-inflammatory or analgesic drugs could therefore be applied in clinical practice.

### Acute kidney injury in the critically ill: an updated review on pathophysiology and management [^114NHJsm]. Intensive Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

What is new in nephrotoxicity?

There are drugs that are directly nephrotoxic, drugs that are not nephrotoxic but interfere with intrarenal hemodynamics (i.e. ACE-inhibitors, NSAIDs) and drugs that are not nephrotoxic, but accumulate in renal failure and should, therefore, also be prescribed with caution. The most commonly incriminated drugs are contrast agents and antibiotics but multidrug toxicity maybe the predominant problem. When prescribing drugs, clinicians should consider how they affect kidney function and whether their clearance is affected by the presence of AKI. Prescription of nephrotoxic medications should be minimized in terms of frequency and duration, however, they should not be withheld in life-threatening situations owing to concern for AKI. Drugs with potentially renoprotective effects should be continued even if they are associated with a mild rise in serum creatinine (i.e. ACE-inhibitors in diabetic nephropathy).

Historically, contrast agents have been considered an important cause of AKI. However, recent observational studies with propensity score-adjusted models found no relevant difference in AKI incidence between those exposed or not exposed to modern contrast agents, even in septic and ICU patients, suggesting that the risk of contrast- induced AKI (causal association) is much lower than previously thought and that contrast -associated AKI (temporal association) frequently has other causes. The absence of a post-contrast increase of biomarkers of kidney injury supports this concept. Hence, contrast-enhanced CT scan should not be postponed if required for the diagnosis of a life-threatening condition. In all other situations, the uncertain risk of contrast- induced AKI should be balanced against the risk of missing an important diagnosis, taking into account the possibility of alternative imaging procedures. Recent guidelines suggest using moderate contrast doses and prophylactic isotonic hydration in patients at risk although even the latter has been questioned. It is evident that in critically ill patients hydration should account for the volume status of the individual patient, balancing the risk of kidney hypoperfusion against the risk of fluid overload. A large RCT confirmed that acetylcysteine has no benefit and that bicarbonate is not better than saline in preventing contrast nephropathy.

Patients with normal kidney function may use these agents in moderate doses for short periods of time, but nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents should be avoided in KTRs whenever possible.

### AGA clinical practice update on the evaluation and management of acute kidney injury in patients with cirrhosis: expert review [^116wmkLo]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) in cirrhosis — algorithmic management begins with an "Acute increase in serum creatinine > 0.3 mg/dL", after which stage 1 is split into "AKI 1a: creatinine ≤ 1.5 mg/dL" and "AKI 1b: creatinine > 1.5 mg/dL", and "AKI 2–3" represents higher-stage disease; initial stage 1 care is "Risk factor management*: monitor 48 hours", while persistent cases and higher stages receive "Risk factors management* Albumin (1g/kg) for 2 days". Nonresolution prompts "Urinary biomarkers" to triage to "Consistent with ATN", for which the action box states "Renal replacement therapy on individualized basis", or "Consistent with HRS", for which the action box states "Vasoconstrictor therapy + albumin". The legend clarifies that "Initial management of AKI (increase in serum creatinine > 0.3 mg/dL in 48 hours) is geared toward reversing risk factors", and that "When the serum creatinine has increased > 1.5mg/dL (Stage 1b), or to ≥ 2 times baseline value (stage 2; stage 3 when serum creatinine has increased > 3 times baseline value) and remains above these levels despite risk factor management for 2 days, then vasoconstrictor agents are indicated provided patient meets HRS criteria"; it also defines response thresholds: "Complete response to therapy is defined return of the serum creatinine with treatment to < 0.3 mg above baseline value; partial response is defined as reduction in serum creatinine but to > 0.3 mg above baseline value". Risk factor management "involves holding diuretics, beta-blockers, and nephrotoxic drugs and discontinuing nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) agents; treating infections and other precipitating causes; and expanding plasma volume as required", and "Careful monitoring for fluid overload is required when albumin is administered in patients with AKI because of the risk of pulmonary edema".

### Literature review: are NSAIDs harmful and is acetaminophen well tolerated? [^116mPu3s]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

On the basis of previous literature, NSAID use is typically avoided in patients at risk for kidney disease, while acetaminophen has generally been considered well tolerated. However, the extent of NSAID effect on the kidneys is not clear, especially in chronic kidney disease (CKD), and the concerns about the safety of acetaminophen have been rising. In this review, we will discuss the latest evidence of the effects of NSAIDs and acetaminophen in the context of nephrology and hypertension.

Recent Findings

The risk of acute kidney injury (AKI) by NSAIDs is higher with longer courses and in the presence of several factors such as older age, diabetes mellitus, lower eGFR, diuretic use and cardiovascular disease. The timing of NSAID use in relation to the onset of AKI may affect its progression. Regular NSAID use could be associated with an increased incidence of CKD, but the relation between NSAID use and CKD progression is less clear. Regular acetaminophen use was associated with increased SBP, while its use could have a renoprotective effect in certain situations.

Summary

In patients at risk of kidney disease, NSAIDs may be used cautiously after discussing possible adverse effects. Regular acetaminophen use should be reassessed in patients with uncontrolled hypertension.

### Nephrotic syndrome and interstitial nephritis associated with celecoxib [^111YxyDK]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are well known to cause fluid and electrolyte abnormalities and renal failure. NSAIDs also may cause an acute allergic interstitial nephritis (AIN) and the nephrotic syndrome, characterized by histologic pathology consistent with minimal change disease in patients with previously normal renal function. The nephrotoxic potential of cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) inhibitors has not been established because AIN associated with nephrotic syndrome has not been reported secondary to the COX-2 inhibitors. This case report describes the first case of AIN associated with nephrotic syndrome in a patient treated with the selective COX-2 inhibitor, celecoxib.

### Acute, reversible nonoliguric renal failure in two children associated with analgesic-antipyretic drugs [^115fLpJC]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2009). Low credibility.

Analgesic-antipyretic agents and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are the most commonly used medications worldwide for the treatment of pain and fever in children. Acute renal failure is commonly seen in adults after treatment with analgesic agents. This complication has rarely been reported in children. Here, we describe 2 patients admitted to our hospital with acute nonoliguric renal failure temporally associated with ingestion of analgesic-antipyretic drugs at therapeutic doses. The first case was a 16-year-old adolescent boy, who had taken acetaminophen (APAP) and mefenamic acid for the indication of upper respiratory tract infection with daily doses of 1500 and 500 mg, respectively. His serum urea nitrogen and creatinine values were 16 and 1.6 mg/dL. The second case was a 12-year-old boy, who had taken APAP with a daily dose of 500 mg for abdominal pain. His serum urea nitrogen and creatinine values were 21 and 2.29 mg/dL. Both of them recovered with appropriate hydration within a week. Over-the-counter analgesic-antipyretic agents seem innocent but carry the risk of acute renal failure even at therapeutic doses. We believe that increased caution and awareness of the toxic effects of APAP and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are needed. We suggest that clinicians should be careful while using analgesic-antipyretic-anti-inflammatory drugs especially in children with subclinical dehydration.

### High prevalence of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug use among acute kidney injury survivors in the Southern community cohort study [^117GvYVx]. BMC Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are widely used and have been linked to acute kidney injury (AKI), chronic kidney disease (CKD) and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Patients who survive an AKI episode are at risk for future adverse kidney and cardiovascular outcomes. The objective of our study was to examine the prevalence and predictors of NSAID use among AKI survivors.

Methods

The Southern Community Cohort Study is a prospective study of low-income adults aged 40–79 in the southeastern US. Through linkage with Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, 826 participants with an AKI diagnosis (ICD-9 584.5–584.9) at any age prior to cohort enrollment were identified. At baseline, data were collected on regular use of prescription and over-the-counter NSAIDs, as well as demographic, medical and other characteristics. Additional comorbidities were ascertained via linkage with CMS or the US Renal Data System.

Results

One hundred fifty-four AKI survivors (19%) reported regular NSAID use at cohort enrollment (52 prescription, 81 OTC, 21 both) and the percentage of NSAID users did not vary by time since AKI event. Over 58% of users were taking NSAIDS regularly both before and after their AKI event. Hypertension (83%), arthritis (71%), heart failure (44%), CKD (36%) and diabetes (35%) were prevalent among NSAID users. In a multivariable model, history of arthritis (OR: 3.00; 95% CI: 1.92, 4.68) and acetaminophen use (OR: 2.43; 95% CI: 1.50, 3.93) were significantly associated with NSAID use, while prevalent CKD (OR: 0.63; 95% CI: 0.41, 0.98) and diabetes (OR: 0.44; 95% CI: 0.29, 0.69) were significantly inversely associated.

Conclusions

NSAID use among AKI survivors is common and highlights the need to understand physician and patient decision-making around NSAIDs and to develop effective strategies to reduce NSAID use in this vulnerable population.

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2012 KDIGO clinical practice guideline for acute kidney injury [^114mzS29]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2013). Medium credibility.

KDOQI commentary — definition, staging, screening, and risk factors for contrast-induced acute kidney injury (CI-AKI): The first recommendation is that contrast-induced AKI be defined and staged using the KDIGO definition and staging criteria, while noting that most clinical studies have used thresholds including increments in serum creatinine level of ≥ 25% or ≥ 50% relative to baseline and/or an absolute change in serum creatinine level ≥ 0.5 mg/dL within 2–5 days following iodinated contrast media. The applicability of the urine output criteria to the diagnosis and staging for this form of AKI is uncertain and most episodes of contrast-induced AKI are nonoliguric. For pre-procedure risk identification, measuring serum creatinine prior to all contrast-enhanced procedures is neither practical nor feasible; simple questionnaires have been shown to be effective for identifying patients at higher risk of abnormal underlying renal function, and in patients without a recent serum creatinine measurement it is reasonable to use such questionnaires to identify patients who should have serum creatinine measured prior to contrast administration. Additional risk factors to recognize include diabetes in the setting of renal impairment, heart failure, repeated contrast exposure over short periods, and concomitant nephrotoxin administration (eg, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and aminoglycosides).

### Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug induced acute kidney injury in the community dwelling general population and people with chronic kidney disease: systematic review and meta-analysis [^114XJ8qG]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Association between NSAID exposure and AKI in the general population

Ten studies that included a total of 1,609,163 participants were used to evaluate AKI risk among current NSAID users in the general population (Fig. 2). The adjusted OR for AKI was increased relative to non-users and between individual studies ranged from 1.05 to 4.10, with eight of the ten studies showing a statistically significant association between NSAID exposure and AKI. Meta-analysis of adjusted odds ratios estimated the pooled OR to be 1.73 (95%CI 1.44–2.07). Heterogeneity was substantial (I 2 = 89%, P < 0.001), suggesting that the pooled estimate should be interpreted with caution.

Association between NSAID exposure and AKI in people with CKD

Two case-control and three nested-case-control studies which included 106,681 people with CKD reported data that could be used to evaluate AKI risk by current NSAID exposure. The crude OR for AKI in NSAID users compared with nonusers ranged from 1.12 to 5.25 and was > 1 and statistically significant in 4 of 5 studies (Fig. 2). The pooled crude OR was 1.63 (95% CI 1.22–2.19) and I 2 statistic was 71% (P = 0.009). We noted weaker associations with AKI in larger studies with more precise estimates of risk, with the two studies reporting the largest risks being older, smaller and less precisely estimated.

### A population-based study on the association between acute renal failure (ARF) and the duration of polypharmacy [^113MiZpk]. BMC Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

Study variables

To investigate the association between the duration of polypharmacy and ARF, we retrospectively collected the medication history of all patients for 1 year prior to hospitalization. The duration of polypharmacy was defined as the summation of days a patient took more than 5 prescription medications on a single day in one year. These patients were further subdivided into those who took polypharmacy for less than 30, 31–90, 91–180, and over 181 days. The dependent variable was the occurrence of ARF (yes/no), whereas the control variables were those factors which were found by previous studies to have significant correlation with ARF, they included age, gender, having comorbidities when hospitalized for ARF, stay in ICUs during ARF hospitalization, site of operation for one month prior to ARF admission and number of days taking NSAID(Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) or Triamterene. Age was classified into four categories: 0–18, 19–64, 65–79 and over 80 years. A comorbidity was defined as the diagnosis of and treatment with medication(s), as inpatient or outpatient for atherosclerotic heart diseases, congestive heart failure, cerebrovascular accident/transient ischemic attack, peripheral disease, other cardiac disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, gastrointestinal bleeding, liver disease, dysrhythmia, cancer and diabetes; all of these comorbidities have been highly associated with failures in renal functions and have been used often in previous studies. Stay in an ICU was classified as yes or no, depending on whether a patient had stayed in an ICU during the same hospitalization. Site of operation has also been found in previous studies as a factor correlated to ARF hospitalization. In our study, site of operation was defined as having a primary operation (in ICD-9-CM OP codes) on the nervous system, endocrine system, eyes, ears, nose, mouth and pharynx, respiratory system, cardiovascular system, hemic and lymphatic system, digestive system, urinary system, male genital organs, female genital organs, musculoskeletal system, or integumentary system, or as obstetric or miscellaneous diagnostic and therapeutic procedures one month prior to ARF hospitalization. NSAID or Triamterene drugs were also found to be correlated to renal failure. Therefore, we also included number of days taking both classes of drugs as a control variable.

### Emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate [^114im3EJ]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

While using emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate for HIV-1 PrEP, HIV-1 testing should be repeated at least every 3 months, and upon diagnosis of any other STIs.

If an HIV-1 test indicates possible HIV-1 infection, or if symptoms consistent with acute HIV-1 infection develop following a potential exposure event, convert the HIV-1 PrEP regimen to an HIV treatment regimen until negative infection status is confirmed using a test approved or cleared by the FDA as an aid in the diagnosis of acute or primary HIV-1 infection.

Counsel HIV-1 uninfected individuals to strictly adhere to the once daily emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate dosing schedule. The effectiveness of emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in reducing the risk of acquiring HIV-1 is strongly correlated with adherence, as demonstrated by measurable drug levels in clinical trials of emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate for HIV-1 PrEP. Some individuals, such as adolescents, may benefit from more frequent visits and counseling to support adherence [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4), Microbiology (12.4), and Clinical Studies (14.3 and 14.4)].

5.3 New Onset or Worsening Renal Impairment

Emtricitabine and tenofovir are principally eliminated by the kidney. Renal impairment, including cases of acute renal failure and Fanconi syndrome (renal tubular injury with severe hypophosphatemia), has been reported with the use of TDF, a component of emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

Prior to initiation and during use of emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, on a clinically appropriate schedule, assess serum creatinine, estimated creatinine clearance, urine glucose, and urine protein in all individuals. In individuals with chronic kidney disease, also assess serum phosphorus.

Emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate should be avoided with concurrent or recent use of a nephrotoxic agent (e.g., high-dose or multiple non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs]) [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]. Cases of acute renal failure after initiation of high-dose or multiple NSAIDs have been reported in HIV-infected patients with risk factors for renal dysfunction who appeared stable on TDF. Some patients required hospitalization and renal replacement therapy. Alternatives to NSAIDs should be considered, if needed, in patients at risk for renal dysfunction.

### Drug class combination-associated acute kidney injury [^112McvfZ]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the quality of available evidence of drug class combinations and their association with the development of acute kidney injury (AKI).

Data Sources

A search of MEDLINE and Embase databases was completed using the following terms: "risk factor AND (acute kidney injury or acute kidney failure) AND (drug or medication)".

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Inclusion criteria were the following: English language, full-text availability, and at least 1 drug-combination. Each citation was evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria. The literature was evaluated using the quality of evidence component of GRADE. No standardized definition of AKI was applied throughout.

Data Synthesis

Out of 2139 total citations, 151 were assessed for full-text review, with 121 citations (6%) meeting inclusion criteria, producing76 unique drug class combinations. Overall, 56 combinations (73.7%) were considered very low quality; 12 (15.8%) were considered low quality. There were 8 (10.5%) of moderate quality, and no combination was considered high quality. 58 (76%) combinations that had a single citation, with a mean of 1.6 citations per drug class combination. The combination of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and diuretics was reported in 10 citations, the largest number of citations.

Conclusions

Our study demonstrates a lack of well-designed studies addressing drug class combination-associated AKI. The combination of NSAIDs and diuretics with or without additional renin-angiotensin aldosterone agents had the strongest level of evidence. Despite limitations, the information included in this review may result in additional scrutiny about combining certain individual nephrotoxic drugs.

### Perioperative acute kidney injury: diagnosis, prediction, prevention, and treatment [^11485sY5]. Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Treatment

Stage-based Treatment Approach

Because advances in the treatment of postoperative AKI have been limited, management in the perioperative period has traditionally focused on prevention and diagnosis. Once postoperative AKI develops, supportive management (i.e. preventing ongoing renal insult through removal of nephrotoxic agents and optimized renal perfusion through fluids and vasopressors) is the mainstay of therapy. The 2012 KDIGO guidelines for the management of AKI recommend a stage-based treatment approach. For stage 1 AKI or patients at high risk for AKI, primary management goals include identifying the likely cause of AKI and avoiding secondary insults where possible (such as administration of NSAIDs or other nephrotoxic medications when alternatives are available). In addition, hemodynamic optimization to ensure adequate kidney perfusion is an important goal, although the guidelines do not provide specific hemodynamic targets. Two single-center randomized controlled trials (one in cardiac surgery and one in noncardiac surgery patients) demonstrated significant reductions in postoperative AKI with a bundled care approach including target MAP 65 mmHg or greater. Notably, a meta-analysis suggested that protocolized approaches to hemodynamic optimization are associated with reduced risk of AKI overall despite differences in specific targets.

### Epidemiologic assessment of the safety of conventional nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [^112L1Gz2]. The American Journal of Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

The use of conventional nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) has been associated with upper gastrointestinal bleeding and perforation (UGIB), acute liver injury, acute renal injury, heart failure, and adverse reproductive outcomes. This article summarizes the effects of various factors, such as NSAID dose, duration of treatment, patient age, and ulcer history, on the incidences of these adverse side effects. We used the UK General Practice Research Database to study further the principal safety concern related to NSAIDs, namely, UGIB.

### Intrinsic acute renal failure… [^1176j9hQ]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

In acute renal failure, the glomerular filtration rate decreases over days to weeks. As a result, excretion of nitrogenous waste is reduced, and fluid and electrolyte balances cannot be maintained. Patients with acute renal failure are often asymptomatic, and the condition is diagnosed by observed elevations of blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine levels. Most authorities define the condition as an acute increase of the serum creatinine level from baseline. 3 Complete renal shutdown is present when the serum creatinine level rises by at least 0. 5 mg per dL per day and the urine output is less than 400 mL per day. The primary agents that cause prerenal acute renal failure are angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. The inhibition of ACE prevents the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, leading to decreased levels of angiotensin II.

Angiotensin II increases the glomerular filtration rate by causing constriction of the efferent arteriole; its absence decreases the glomerular filtration rate because of dilatation of the efferent arteriole. In certain patients, the glomerular filtration rate is particularly dependent on the effects of angiotensin II. If these patients take an ACE inhibitor, their glomerular filtration rate decreases, and pre-renal acute renal failure can develop. Potassium, BUN and creatinine levels should be obtained soon after patients start taking an ACE inhibitor. NSAIDs cause prerenal acute renal failure by blocking prostaglandin production, which also alters local glomerular arteriolar perfusion. Between 20 and 60 percent of patients require short-term dialysis, particularly when the BUN exceeds 100 mg per dL and the serum creatinine level exceeds the range of 5 to 10 mg per dL.

Indications for dialysis include acidosis or electrolyte disturbances that do not respond to pharmacologic therapy, fluid overload that does not respond to diuretics, and uremia. In patients with progressive acute renal failure, urgent consultation with a nephrologist is indicated.

### Concurrent use of diuretics, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor blockers with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and risk of acute kidney injury: nested case-control study [^116zvSZ6]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

We also did several sensitivity analyses to evaluate the robustness of the results. The first consisted of repeating all analyses by restricting the cases to the subset requiring dialysis. In a second analysis, we repeated the analyses by additionally matching cases and controls on general practice to further control for potential residual confounders from practice level prescribing patterns and social deprivation (we did not match on general practice as part of the primary analysis because of the exclusion of 573 (26%) cases). In a third analysis, we verified whether the introduction in the UK of new quality outcome framework guidelines over the study period, concerning the recording and treatment of diabetes and chronic kidney disease, had affected the accuracy of both diagnoses of acute kidney injury and chronic kidney failure in the CPRD. Thus, we stratified cases and matched controls on calendar period (1998–2002, 2003–07, 2008–10) and diabetes diagnosis (as these patients are prone to develop chronic and acute kidney diseases). In a fourth analysis, we tested the definition of current use by varying the width of the exposure time window and grace period to 60 and 30 days. In a fifth analysis, we stratified cases and matched controls on prevalent user status (this was a matching variable) to assess the effect of including prevalent users in the main models. In a sixth analysis, we assessed the impact of over the counter use of NSAIDs by restricting the cases and matched controls to patients with osteoarthritis, a population for whom the chronic use of NSAIDs is likely to involve physicians' prescriptions. Finally, because the CPRD does not include information on drug exposure in the inpatient setting, possibly leading to immeasurable time bias, we assessed the effect of this bias by repeating the analyses after excluding patients who had been admitted to hospital during the current time window. We used SAS version 9.2 for all analyses.

### Celecoxib-induced acute interstitial nephritis [^112Ri6KG]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Data about the nephrotoxicity of selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors are still evolving. Acute interstitial nephritis is a well-described complication of therapy with nonselective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. We report a case of biopsy-proven acute interstitial nephritis in a 73-year-old diabetic woman, who had taken celecoxib for more than 1 year before presentation. She presented with clinical findings of subnephrotic proteinuria and acute renal failure that required dialysis. She recovered renal function with cessation of celecoxib therapy after 2 weeks. Other medications were reintroduced safely, without recurrence of renal failure. A kidney biopsy specimen showed acute interstitial nephritis with a prominent eosinophilic infiltrate in the interstitium. This case documents the occurrence of acute interstitial nephritis with celecoxib and emphasizes the need for continued vigilance and care in use of cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors in high-risk patients.

### Nabumetone (Relafen ds) [^115cfJbc]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

NSAIDs should be prescribed with extreme caution in those with a prior history of ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding. Patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or gastrointestinal bleeding who use NSAIDs have a greater than 10 fold increased risk for developing a GI bleed compared to patients with neither of these risk factors. Other factors that increase the risk for GI bleeding in patients treated with NSAIDs include concomitant use of oral corticosteroids or anticoagulants, longer duration of NSAID therapy, smoking, use of alcohol, older age, and poor general health status. Most spontaneous reports of fatal GI events are in elderly or debilitated patients and therefore, special care should be taken in treating this population.

To minimize the potential risk for an adverse GI event in patients treated with an NSAID, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest possible duration. Patients and physicians should remain alert for signs and symptoms of GI ulceration and bleeding during NSAID therapy and promptly initiate additional evaluation and treatment if a serious GI adverse event is suspected. This should include discontinuation of the NSAID until a serious GI adverse event is ruled out. For high risk patients, alternate therapies that do not involve NSAIDs should be considered.

Renal Effects

Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury. Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of an NSAID results in a dose-dependent decrease in prostaglandin synthesis and, secondarily, in a reduction of renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation. Patients at greatest risk of this reaction are those with impaired renal function, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics, and the elderly. Discontinuation of NSAID therapy is usually followed by recovery to the pretreatment state.

The use of nonopioid analgesics — nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) should be administered at their lowest effective analgesic doses both in the ED and upon discharge, and should be given for the shortest appropriate treatment course, with caution strongly advised in patients at risk for renal insufficiency, heart failure, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, and in the elderly. Patients who present with acute pain warranting NSAIDs can be given topical NSAID preparations (Diclofenac gel or patch) when there are contraindications to systemic use. Other considerations include topical preparations of lidocaine, which is available as both a gel and patch, and lidocaine comes available in a 5% patch formulation, which has shown to be both safe and effective for various neurologic and musculoskeletal conditions including acute and chronic low back pain, diabetic neuropathy, postherpetic neuralgia, and carpal tunnel syndrome.

Renal Toxicity

Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury.

Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of an NSAID may cause a dose-dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation. Patients at greatest risk of this reaction are those with impaired renal function, dehydration, hypovolemia, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics and ACE inhibitors or ARBs, and the elderly. Discontinuation of NSAID therapy is usually followed by recovery to the pretreatment state.

No information is available from controlled clinical studies regarding the use of TIVORBEX in patients with advanced renal disease. The renal effects of TIVORBEX may hasten the progression of renal dysfunction in patients with preexisting renal disease.

Correct volume status in dehydrated or hypovolemic patients prior to initiating TIVORBEX. Monitor renal function in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, heart failure, dehydration, or hypovolemia during use of TIVORBEX [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Avoid the use of TIVORBEX in patients with advanced renal disease unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening renal function. If TIVORBEX is used in patients with advanced renal disease, monitor patients for signs of worsening renal function.

It has been reported that the addition of the potassium-sparing diuretic, triamterene, to a maintenance schedule of indomethacin resulted in reversible acute renal failure in two of four healthy volunteers. Indomethacin and triamterene should not be administered together.

Hyperkalemia

Increases in serum potassium concentration, including hyperkalemia, have been reported with use of NSAIDs, even in some patients without renal impairment. In patients with normal renal function, these effects have been attributed to a hyporeninemic-hypoaldosteronism state.

Both indomethacin and potassium-sparing diuretics may be associated with increased serum potassium levels. The potential effects of indomethacin and potassium-sparing diuretics on potassium levels and renal function should be considered when these agents are administered concurrently.

5.7 Anaphylact ic Reactions

Indomethacin has been associated with anaphylactic reactions in patients with and without known hypersensitivity to indomethacin and in patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.8)].

Seek emergency help if an anaphylactic reaction occurs.

### Estimated GFR reporting is associated with decreased nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug prescribing and increased renal function [^1141rhZs]. Kidney International (2013). Low credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a worldwide public health problem with an increasing incidence and prevalence, particularly in elderly populations. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are widely used in elderly populations. They are also nephrotoxic agents with both acute and chronic effects on kidney function. Previous studies have shown that NSAIDs are associated with a decrease in kidney function. Data from Scotland have shown a decrease in the use of NSAIDs over the period 2004–2008. In April 2006, the Scottish Renal Registry and the National Service Framework (NSF) recommended that reporting of creatinine measurements should be accompanied by an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). The aims of this study were to determine NSAID prescribing before and after the implementation of eGFR reporting and to evaluate renal function in patients who used NSAIDs but stopped these after eGFR reporting was implemented.

Practice Point 4.3.2 — acute illness medication discontinuation planning in CKD — states: If medications are discontinued during an acute illness, communicate a clear plan of when to restart the discontinued medications to the affected person and health professionals who interact with them, and if time is needed to confirm whether the plan is appropriate, try to communicate and provide support in the interim. Sick day rules have been endorsed for acute, dehydrating illness and advise temporarily stopping sulfonylureas, ACEi, diuretics/direct renin inhibitors, metformin, ARBs, NSAIDs, and SGLT2i, but there is a paucity of evidence to support these rules and data suggest potential harm from mistakes; the most reported problem is failure to restart the medication. The plan to restart should be detailed in the medical records and clearly communicated to patients, and patients may additionally benefit from medication review within a month to ensure appropriate medications are restarted.

The major goals of the Kidney Precision Medicine Project (KPMPP) are to establish a molecular atlas of the kidney in health and disease and improve our understanding of the molecular drivers of CKD and AKI. In this clinical-pathologic-molecular correlation, we describe the case of a 38-year-old woman without any history of CKD who underwent a research kidney biopsy in the setting of AKI suspected to be due to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory use after cesarean section delivery. The participant's histopathology was consistent with mild acute tubular injury, without significant interstitial fibrosis or tubular atrophy. This diagnosis was supported by analysis of the glomerular and tubulointerstitial proteomes. The proteomic interrogation revealed a molecular landscape that demonstrated differences in kidney prostaglandin synthesis that may be in response to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and signs of intrarenal inflammation and fibrosis that were not evident by histopathology alone.

Renal Effects

Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal
papillary necrosis and other renal injury. Renal toxicity has also been seen in
patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the
maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of a
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug may cause a dose dependent reduction in
prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may
precipitate over renal decompensation. Patients at greatest risk of this
reaction are those with impaired renal function, heart failure, liver
dysfunction, those taking diuretics and ACE inhibitors, patients with volume
depletion, and the elderly. Discontinuation of NSAID therapy is usually followed
by recovery to the pretreatment state.

Increases in serum potassium concentration, including hyperkalemia, have been
reported with use of indomethacin, even in some patients without renal
impairment. In patients with normal renal function, these effects have been
attributed to a hyporeninemic-hypoaldosteronism state (see PRECAUTIONS:
Drug Interactions).

Advanced Renal Disease

No information is available from controlled clinical studies
regarding the use of indomethacin in patients with advanced renal disease.
Therefore, treatment with indomethacin is not recommended in these patients with
advanced renal disease. If indomethacin therapy must be initiated, close
monitoring of the patient's renal function is advisable.

disease. If indomethacin therapy must be initiated, close monitoring of the
patient's renal function is advisable.

Anaphylactic/Anaphylactoid Reactions

As with other NSAIDs, anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions may occur in patients
without known prior exposure to indomethacin. Indomethacin should not be given
to patients with the aspirin triad. This symptom complex typically occurs in
asthmatic patients who experience rhinitis with or without nasal polyps, or who
exhibit severe, potentially fatal bronchospasm after taking aspirin or other
NSAIDs

Emergency help should be sought in cases where
an anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reaction occurs.

Skin Reactions

NSAIDs, including indomethacin, can cause serious skin adverse events such as
exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), and toxic epidermal
necrolysis (TEN), which can be fatal. These serious events may occur without
warning. Patients should be informed about the signs and symptoms of serious
skin manifestations and use of the drug should be discontinued at the first
appearance of skin rash or any other sign of hypersensitivity.

First-trimester abortion — precautions with routine abortion medications: The use of ergot alkaloids is contraindicated for patients taking potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 (which include protease inhibitors, azole antifungals and some macrolide antibiotics) and/or with hypertension. Most providers do not routinely administer uterotonics for the management of first-trimester abortions. Carboprost tromethamine is contraindicated in patients with active cardiac, pulmonary, renal, or hepatic disease. In general, lidocaine is an antiarrhythmic that can be used safely for patients with cardiac disease. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) should be avoided in patients with thrombocytopenia or other preexisting platelet defects (e.g., von Willebrand disease), and in patients at risk of acute renal failure.

### Acute drug-induced tubulointerstitial nephritis: current perspectives on diagnosis and treatment [^113cCBXR]. Advances in Kidney Disease and Health (2025). Medium credibility.

Acute tubulointerstitial nephritis (ATIN) is one of the leading causes of acute kidney injury (AKI), accounting for approximately 15–27% of biopsy-proven cases of AKI. While some patients recover kidney function with timely intervention, a subset of patients may progress to chronic kidney disease and around one-third of the patients will require chronic dialysis. Drug-induced ATIN is the most common form and is often associated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, antibiotics, and proton pump inhibitors. Infections, autoimmune disorders, such as Sjögren's syndrome and sarcoidosis contribute to a smaller proportion of cases. Clinically, ATIN presents with a wide spectrum of symptoms ranging from asymptomatic AKI to systemic manifestations such as fever, rash, arthralgia, and eosinophilia. Urinalysis often reveals sterile pyuria, hematuria, and occasionally, white blood cell casts. Proteinuria is typically mild (< 1.5 g/24 hours. Definitive diagnosis requires kidney biopsy, which reveals the presence of an extensive interstitial infiltrate, mainly composed of lymphocytes and monocytes, along with interstitial edema, and varying degrees of tubular injury. Early identification and management are critical to prevent irreversible kidney damage. So far, the optimal treatment of this entity is not yet well characterized but treatment strategies for ATIN must focus on prompt discontinuing the offending agent, supportive care, and corticosteroid therapy.

5.5	New Onset or Worsening Renal Impairment

Renal impairment, including cases of acute renal failure and Fanconi syndrome (renal tubular injury with severe hypophosphatemia), has been reported with the use of TDF [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

Prior to initiation of COMPLERA, and during treatment with COMPLERA, on a clinically appropriate schedule, assess serum creatinine, estimated creatinine clearance, urine glucose, and urine protein in all patients. In patients with chronic kidney disease, also assess serum phosphorus.

COMPLERA should be avoided with concurrent or recent use of a nephrotoxic agent (e.g., high-dose or multiple nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs]) [see Drug Interactions (7.4)]. Cases of acute renal failure after initiation of high-dose or multiple NSAIDs have been reported in HIV-infected patients with risk factors for renal dysfunction who appeared stable on TDF. Some patients required hospitalization and renal replacement therapy. Alternatives to NSAIDs should be considered, if needed, in patients at risk for renal dysfunction.

Persistent or worsening bone pain, pain in extremities, fractures, and/or muscular pain or weakness may be manifestations of proximal renal tubulopathy and should prompt an evaluation of renal function in at-risk patients.

Emtricitabine and TDF are principally eliminated by the kidney; however, RPV is not. Since COMPLERA is a combination product and the dose of the individual components cannot be altered, COMPLERA is not recommended in patients with estimated creatinine clearance below 50 mL per minute [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

### ASN kidney health guidance on the outpatient management of patients with dialysis-requiring acute kidney injury [^112LNkmR]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2025). High credibility.

Medication management — Patients with AKI-D have a significant medication burden; medication review and management (beyond simple medication reconciliation) at every transition of care is critical to avoid medication-related errors and to identify nephrotoxins. Nephrotoxins should be avoided whenever possible in the maintenance and recovery phases of acute kidney injury (AKI); potential nephrotoxins include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, certain antimicrobial agents, proton pump inhibitors, iodinated contrast, and herbal supplements. In patients with AKI-D, timed urine collections for creatinine and urea clearances can inform drug dosing, and in anuric patients, an eGFR < 10 ml/min should be generally used for drug dosing, with possible supplemental dosing after dialysis for medications cleared by dialysis. Clinicians should also be aware of cardio- and kidney-protective medications and restart or initiate them in a timely manner as AKI survivors are at high risk of adverse cardiovascular events.

### A randomized clinical trial assessing the effect of automated medication-targeted alerts on acute kidney injury outcomes [^116EKDz6]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

We were surprised to see no clinical benefit of alerts in the NSAID subgroup. We targeted this class of medications given the broad consensus and international guidelines that suggest discontinuing NSAIDs in the setting of AKI given their known potent adverse biological effects on kidney health. While the alert did numerically increase the rate of cessation of NSAIDs, the effect was not statistically significant. The control rate of NSAID cessation was the highest of any class, indicating that many physicians are stopping NSAIDs during AKI. Alerts can only translate to clinical benefit when they induce a substantial change in provider behavior.

Our observation that alerts reduced the primary outcome among those treated with PPIs has several potential explanations. Although this was a pre-specified subgroup analysis, there is the possibility that this signal is due to chance. Alternatively, there may be a causal link between PPI-use and AKI which is ameliorated by cessation in the context of alerting. Prior research, predominantly observational, has elucidated associations between PPI and AKI, and particularly acute interstitial nephritis. Research has also suggested a link between PPI use and CKD. We also recognize that the alert may have effects on AKI diagnosis, management, and treatment beyond medication cessation alone. In that context, the observed benefit among those receiving PPIs may be due to the fact that PPI use flags a distinct population of patients that benefit from AKI alerts in general. We note, for example, that those receiving PPIs were in more acutely ill than those who were not receiving PPI — with a higher proportion randomized in the ICU, and overall worse outcomes. Our mediation analysis, though underpowered, suggests that there are multiple pathways of alert benefit in this population, with some, but likely not the majority, benefit mediated by actual cessation of the PPI. Further studies to elucidate the mechanism of PPI-associated AKI and the benefit of withholding these medications in the setting of changes in kidney function are needed.

5.1 Renal Disease, Acute Phosphate Nephropathy, and Electrolyte Disorders

Renal Disease and Acute Phosphate Nephropathy

There have been rare, but serious, reports of renal failure, acute phosphate nephropathy, and nephrocalcinosis in patients who received oral sodium phosphate products, including Monobasic Sodium Phosphate and Dibasic Sodium Phosphate Tablets, for colon cleansing prior to colonoscopy. These cases often resulted in permanent impairment of renal function and several patients required long-term dialysis. The time to onset is typically within days; however, in some cases, the diagnosis of these events has been delayed up to several months after the ingestion of these products. Patients at increased risk of acute phosphate nephropathy may include patients with the following: hypovolemia, baseline kidney disease, increased age, and patients using medicines that affect renal perfusion or function [such as diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and possibly nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

Electrolyte Disorders

Bowel preparations, including Monobasic Sodium Phosphate and Dibasic Sodium Phosphate Tabletscan cause fluid and electrolyte disturbances, which can lead to serious adverse reactions including cardiac arrhythmias, seizures and renal impairment [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

### Ketorolac tromethamine (Ketorolac) [^1168Posc]. FDA (2011). Low credibility.

In post-marketing experience, postoperative hematomas and other signs of
wound bleeding have been reported in association with the perioperative use of
IV or IM dosing of ketorolac tromethamine. Therefore, perioperative use of
ketorolac tromethamine should be avoided and postoperative use be undertaken
with caution when hemostasis is critical (see PRECAUTIONS).

Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal
papillary necrosis and other renal injury. Renal toxicity has also been seen in
patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the
maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of a NSAID may
cause a dose-dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in
renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation. Patients at
greatest risk of this reaction are those with impaired renal function, heart
failure, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics and ACE inhibitors, and the
elderly. Discontinuation of NSAID therapy is usually followed by recovery to the
pretreatment state.

Ketorolac tromethamine and its metabolites are eliminated primarily by the
kidneys, which, in patients with reduced creatinine clearance, will result in
diminished clearance of the drug (see CLINICAL
PHARMACOLOGY). Therefore, ketorolac tromethamine should be used with caution
in patients with impaired renal function (see DOSAGE AND
ADMINISTRATION) and such patients should be followed closely. With the use
of ketorolac tromethamine, there have been reports of acute renal failure,
interstitial nephritis and nephrotic syndrome.
