## Question

what is the incidence of myocarditis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the incidence of myocarditis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the baseline incidence of viral myocarditis in the general population. Then, I should verify how COVID-19 infection altered that baseline. Next, I will examine vaccine-associated myocarditis, especially mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, by age and sex. After that, I need to check immune checkpoint inhibitor–associated myocarditis. I will then consider pediatric-specific incidence and fulminant myocarditis. Finally, I should review methodological limitations and reconcile apparent discrepancies before summarizing key takeaways with appropriate caveats and ranges.

> Let me first confirm the baseline incidence of viral myocarditis in the general population, because this anchors all other comparisons. Multiple high-quality sources converge on an annual incidence of roughly 4 to 22 per 100,000 person-years, with typical estimates around 10 to 20 per 100,000, and a commonly cited figure of about 16 per 100,000 person-years in the United States in 2020, which aligns with the broader literature range [^116Pk5X8] [^112ao22M] [^115hgUd7] [^117Xemqm].

> Wait, let me verify the global burden estimates to ensure consistency. The Global Burden of Disease analyses report a worldwide incidence of acute myocarditis of approximately 40.89 per 100,000 person-years from 1990 to 2017, which is higher than many national estimates and likely reflects differences in case ascertainment, coding, and inclusion of subclinical or mild cases across regions and time periods [^114YCZRZ] [^113XqY4P].

> Next, I should review how COVID-19 infection changed this baseline. Large epidemiologic datasets show a marked increase in myocarditis after SARS-CoV-2 infection, with estimates ranging from about 150 to 410 per 100,000 in some cohorts, indicating a roughly 15-fold or greater increase over non-COVID baselines, and CDC data suggest inpatient myocarditis encounters rose about 42% in 2020 and were nearly 16 times higher among those with COVID-19 than those without, with risk highest in older adults and children, which I should keep in mind when interpreting age-specific patterns [^113NCCCa] [^112VnV4u] [^1171wFxj].

> Hold on, I should verify whether this COVID-associated signal is specific or a general viral effect. Comparative studies suggest the myocarditis risk after COVID-19 exceeds that after influenza, supporting a COVID-specific elevation rather than a generic viral respiratory signal, which strengthens the causal interpretation even though observational designs remain susceptible to residual confounding [^1155xzTk].

> I will now examine vaccine-associated myocarditis, especially mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, because this is where confusion often arises. High-quality living evidence syntheses indicate the highest incidence in adolescent and young adult males after dose 2, with ranges of about 50 to 139 per million in males aged 12 to 17 years and 28 to 147 per million in males aged 18 to 29 years, while in females and older adults the incidence is substantially lower, often fewer than 20 per million, and there is moderate certainty that Moderna confers a higher risk than Pfizer in 18 to 29 year old men [^114enCLN] [^112ekrzy] [^117C7q4K] [^114xnJeb].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought the overall mRNA vaccine myocarditis incidence was around 10 per 100,000, but I should double-check that figure. Some summaries report an overall incidence near 10 per 100,000, yet this masks profound age-sex heterogeneity; the more precise and policy-relevant signal is concentrated in young males after dose 2, with pooled adolescent estimates around 4.5 per 100,000 vaccinations overall and a roughly sevenfold male predominance, so my earlier blanket 10 per 100,000 estimate overgeneralizes and I should correct toward the age-sex stratified ranges above [^116njpLo] [^114wz2Ys] [^114enCLN].

> Let me consider dosing and interval effects, because they matter clinically. Extending the interval between dose 1 and dose 2 to at least 31 days, and possibly 56 days for men 18 to 29, is associated with lower myocarditis incidence after the second dose, which is actionable for risk mitigation in the highest-risk group [^116F8QiN] [^114enCLN].

> Next, I should review immune checkpoint inhibitor–associated myocarditis, since this is a distinct iatrogenic category with different risk features. Registry and cohort data suggest an incidence of about 0.04% to 1.14% among ICI recipients, with substantially higher risk and mortality with combination therapy, and a median onset within weeks of initiation; importantly, case definitions and ascertainment vary, so true incidence may be underestimated without standardized diagnostic criteria and active surveillance [^111g2Znp] [^115eSvra] [^113WhKdM].

> I need to check pediatric-specific incidence to avoid extrapolating adult data. Nationwide Finnish data show an overall pediatric incidence of about 1.95 per 100,000 person-years, with a striking male predominance emerging after age 6 and peaking in mid-adolescence, which aligns with the vaccine signal concentration in adolescent males and underscores age-dependent sex effects [^117JVfDX] [^111AZR5y].

> But wait, what about fulminant myocarditis, since incidence and outcomes differ markedly from nonfulminant disease. Fulminant myocarditis is rare, often requiring mechanical circulatory support, and carries high early morbidity and mortality despite aggressive care, with contemporary series suggesting in-hospital death or transplant rates around 25% in advanced presentations, emphasizing the need for early recognition and transfer to advanced heart failure centers [^111Nx9Yi] [^115vQRwz] [^1122rvKE].

> I should confirm key methodological limitations that confound incidence estimates across sources. Passive surveillance underestimates incidence, case definitions vary widely, many studies lack cardiac MRI confirmation, and access to advanced imaging and biopsy differs by setting, all of which can bias estimates downward or upward; systematic CMR screening increases detection several-fold, illustrating substantial underdiagnosis in routine practice [^112vqi9q] [^116CicoG] [^114bPg7L].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions without reconciling apparently conflicting figures. The GBD estimate of roughly 41 per 100,000 person-years globally likely reflects broader case capture and regional variability, whereas U.S. estimates of 4 to 22 per 100,000 reflect national surveillance and clinical cohorts; both can be correct within their ascertainment frameworks, and the COVID-era rise to 150 to 410 per 100,000 after infection sits well above either baseline, while vaccine-associated myocarditis remains rare overall and concentrated in young males, consistent with biological plausibility and observed risk gradients [^114YCZRZ] [^113NCCCa] [^114enCLN].

> Let me reconsider the clinical implications to ensure the synthesis is actionable. For young males considering mRNA vaccination, the absolute risk of myocarditis after dose 2 is on the order of tens per million, modifiable by product selection and extended dosing interval, and remains far lower than the myocarditis risk from COVID-19 infection itself, which supports the favorable benefit-risk balance in this group when counseling patients [^114enCLN] [^1142FuDe] [^111gVBMK].

> In summary, I should confirm the core ranges: baseline viral myocarditis incidence is about 4 to 22 per 100,000 person-years in general populations, COVID-19 infection increases risk roughly 10- to 20-fold in some cohorts, mRNA vaccine-associated myocarditis occurs in about 50 to 140 per million in adolescent and young adult males after dose 2 with much lower rates in females and older adults, ICI-associated myocarditis occurs in about 0.04% to 1% of treated patients with higher risk in combination regimens, pediatric incidence is about 2 per 100,000 person-years with a strong male predominance after age 6, and fulminant myocarditis is rare but high risk, with all estimates subject to case definition and ascertainment effects that can materially shift apparent incidence [^116Pk5X8] [^113NCCCa] [^114enCLN] [^111g2Znp] [^117JVfDX] [^111Nx9Yi] [^112vqi9q].

Myocarditis incidence is **10–22 per 100,000 person-years** [^112ao22M] globally, with notable variability by age, sex, and etiology [^113aGLfx]. Viral infections are the most common cause, and COVID-19 has increased incidence to **150–400 per 100,000** in some cohorts [^113NCCCa]. mRNA COVID-19 vaccines are associated with a rare myocarditis risk of **10–50 per million**, highest in males aged 12–29 after dose 2 [^114enCLN] [^112ekrzy]. Immune checkpoint inhibitors cause myocarditis in **0.06%–1.14%** of patients [^111g2Znp], with higher risk in combination therapy [^115eSvra]. Most cases are mild and self-limited, but fulminant myocarditis carries high mortality and may require mechanical support or transplant [^115vQRwz] [^1122rvKE].

---

## Global incidence and prevalence

- **Global incidence**: 10–22 per 100,000 person-years [^112ao22M] [^115jGHH4].
- **Global prevalence**: 9.86–24.03 per 100,000 [^111fZ8F5] [^114fSQiD].
- **Regional variation**: Higher incidence in high-income regions; Central Asia shows the largest recent increases [^113aGLfx] [^1164Wf9q].

---

## Age and sex distribution

- **Age**: Incidence peaks in children and older adults; fulminant cases are more common in younger patients [^113aGLfx].
- **Sex**: Males have higher incidence, especially in adolescents and young adults [^117JVfDX] [^116spKMW].
- **Pediatric incidence**: 1.95 per 100,000 person-years in Finland; male predominance emerges after age 5 [^117JVfDX] [^111AZR5y].

## Etiological factors

| **Etiology** | **Incidence** | **Notes** |
|-|-|-|
| Viral infections | Most common | COVID-19: 150–400 per 100,000 in some cohorts [^113NCCCa] |
| mRNA COVID-19 vaccines | 10–50 per million | Highest in males 12–29 after dose 2 [^114enCLN] [^116hLoQp] |
| Immune checkpoint inhibitors | 0.06%–1.14% | Higher with combination therapy [^111g2Znp] [^115eSvra] |
| Autoimmune diseases | Rare | Associated with systemic inflammation [^notfound] |

---

## Clinical outcomes and prognosis

- **Mild cases**: Often self-limited with full recovery [^117Xemqm].
- **Severe cases**: Can cause heart failure, arrhythmias, or cardiogenic shock [^116Pk5X8].
- **Fulminant myocarditis**: High mortality; may require mechanical support or transplant [^115vQRwz] [^111Nx9Yi].
- **Long-term sequelae**: Some develop chronic heart failure or recurrent myocarditis [^115sZQFC] [^111Nx9Yi].

---

## Diagnostic challenges

- **Diagnosis**: Based on clinical suspicion, biomarkers, ECG, echocardiography, and CMR [^11189PD4] [^113XT5DB].
- **CMR**: Noninvasive gold standard; EMB reserved for severe or unclear cases [^11189PD4] [^116hLoQp].
- **Underdiagnosis**: Common due to nonspecific symptoms and limited access to CMR [^114bPg7L] [^116hLoQp].

---

## Public health implications

Public health implications include a **substantial global burden** with rising case numbers, especially in high-income regions [^113aGLfx] [^1164Wf9q]. Prevention centers on vaccination, infection control, and surveillance for **drug-induced myocarditis** [^1142FuDe] [^113nfvJY]. Management requires **standardized diagnostic criteria**, evidence-based treatment protocols, and coordinated care pathways [^112pJEst] [^115UZgJi].

---

Myocarditis incidence is **10–22 per 100,000 person-years** globally, with significant variation by age, sex, and cause [^112ao22M]. COVID-19 has increased incidence, and mRNA vaccines carry a rare but higher risk in young males; most cases are mild, but fulminant disease can be fatal [^113NCCCa] [^114enCLN] [^115vQRwz].

### What is the evidence of the diagnostic Criteria and screening of immune checkpoint inhibitor-induced myocarditis? [^115eSvra]. JACC: CardioOncology (2022). Medium credibility.

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) reduce the risk of death and recurrence of many cancers. While use of these agents is expanding, immune-related adverse events (irAEs) is of concern. Myocarditis, one of the most serious, has reported fatality rates from 25% to 40%. Although rare (1% to 2%), myocarditis occurs more frequently with combination therapy and early. Death can occur secondary to cardiovascular causes, but also due to cancer progression if ICI therapy must be stopped. Treatment is generally high-dose corticosteroids followed by intensified immunosuppressive therapy. Given the severity of this complication, recommendations have been proposed to guide clinicians in the diagnosis and screening of ICI-related myocarditis. This paper provides a brief overview of recent evidence and challenges that reflect the current approach to this topic.

### Viral myocarditis-incidence, diagnosis and management [^112ao22M]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2020). Medium credibility.

Viral myocarditis has an incidence rate of 10 to 22 per 100,000 individuals. The presentation pattern of viral myocarditis can range from nonspecific symptoms of fatigue and shortness of breath to more aggressive symptoms that mimic acute coronary syndrome. After the initial acute phase presentation of viral myocarditis, the virus may be cleared, resulting in full clinical recovery; the viral infection may persist; or the viral infection may lead to a persistent autoimmune-mediated inflammatory process with continuing symptoms of heart failure. As a result of these 3 possibilities, the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of viral myocarditis can be extremely unpredictable and challenging for the clinician. Herein, the incidence, etiology, definition and classification, clinical manifestation, diagnosis, pathogenesis, prognosis, and treatment of viral myocarditis are reviewed, and how acute clinical care teams might differentiate between viral myocarditis and other acute cardiac conditions is discussed.

Review questions

We asked five main questions for the review. Firstly, what is the incidence of myocarditis and pericarditis after mRNA covid-19 vaccination? We used data stratified by age and sex, in individuals aged 0–4, 5–11, 12–17, or 18–29 years after their second dose, recipients of any age after a third dose, and individuals with a history of myocarditis after mRNA covid-19 vaccination.

Secondly, among individuals of a similar age and sex, what risk or protective factors exist for myocarditis and pericarditis after mRNA covid-19 vaccination? Examples of factors include pre-existing conditions (eg, cardiac diseases, immunocompromise), previous SARS-CoV-2 infection (symptomatic or asymptomatic) or other viral infections, pharmacotherapies (eg, hormones), type of vaccine product, length of vaccine dosing interval, and vaccine combinations for first v second v booster doses.

Thirdly, what are the characteristics and short term clinical course of myocarditis or pericarditis after covid-19 vaccination, in children younger than 12 years, recipients of any age after a third dose, and individuals with a history of myocarditis after mRNA covid-19 vaccination? From our original review, what are the characteristics and short term clinical course of myocarditis or pericarditis after covid-19 vaccination (ie, across all ages and after a second vaccine dose)?

The fourth question asked what the prognosis is in the longer term (≥ 4 weeks) among individuals of a similar age and sex who had myocarditis or pericarditis after mRNA covid-19 vaccination, and does this vary by patient characteristics or vaccine?

Finally, we asked what are the hypothesised mechanisms involved in myocarditis and pericarditis after vaccination with mRNA covid-19 vaccines, and do they vary by patient or vaccine characteristics?

### Incidence, risk factors, natural history, and hypothesised mechanisms of myocarditis and pericarditis following COVID-19 vaccination: living evidence syntheses and review [^112ekrzy]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

This evidence synthesis included systematic reviews of incidence rates (in people aged 0–39 years) and risk factors for myocarditis and pericarditis after covid-19 mRNA vaccination, evidence reviews of initial presentation and clinical course and of longer term outcomes of cases, and a description of proposed mechanisms and their supporting evidence. We originally reviewed (in our literature search on 6 October 2021) incidence rates, risk factors, and case presentation and short term outcomes of myocarditis or pericarditis after covid-19 vaccination across all vaccines, ages, and sexes. Our results indicated that incident rates were very low to none after non-mRNA vaccines and in adults aged 40 years and older, that rates after mRNA vaccination varied by sex, age, and dose, and that the case characteristics and clinical course of myocarditis and pericarditis differed. At that time, no data were available for children aged < 12 years or for people after receiving a third dose. For this review, we refined the questions to focus on gaps and priorities of the stakeholder or decision maker, specifically, mRNA vaccines, priority age and risk groups, and cases after a third vaccine dose. Where possible, we limited cases to those confirmed by medical record review and of myocarditis or myopericarditis, or pericarditis rather than in combination (when data were available separately). We also expanded the scope to include evidence on longer term outcomes. Finally, we added descriptions and studies of hypothesised mechanisms. This report focuses on the refined questions but also includes findings on characteristics and short term clinical course of myocarditis or pericarditis after any dose of the vaccine across all ages from the original review.

### Incidence, risk factors, natural history, and hypothesised mechanisms of myocarditis and pericarditis following COVID-19 vaccination: living evidence syntheses and review [^114enCLN]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Objectives

To synthesise evidence on incidence rates and risk factors for myocarditis and pericarditis after use of mRNA vaccination against covid-19, clinical presentation, short term and longer term outcomes of cases, and proposed mechanisms.

Design

Living evidence syntheses and review.

Data Sources

Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Library were searched from 6 October 2020 to 10 January 2022; reference lists and grey literature (to 13 January 2021). One reviewer completed screening and another verified 50% of exclusions, using a machine learning program to prioritise records. A second reviewer verified all exclusions at full text, extracted data, and (for incidence and risk factors) risk of bias assessments using modified Joanna Briggs Institute tools. Team consensus determined certainty of evidence ratings for incidence and risk factors using GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation).

Eligibility Criteria For Selecting Studies

Large (> 10000 participants) or population based or multisite observational studies and surveillance data (incidence and risk factors) reporting on confirmed myocarditis or pericarditis after covid-19 mRNA vaccination; case series (n ≥ 5, presentation, short term clinical course and longer term outcomes); opinions, letters, reviews, and primary studies focused on describing or supporting hypothesised mechanisms.

Results

46 studies were included (14 on incidence, seven on risk factors, 11 on characteristics and short term course, three on longer term outcomes, and 21 on mechanisms). Incidence of myocarditis after mRNA vaccines was highest in male adolescents and male young adults (age 12–17 years, range 50–139 cases per million (low certainty); 18–29 years, 28–147 per million (moderate certainty)). For girls and boys aged 5–11 years and women aged 18–29 years, incidence of myocarditis after vaccination with BNT162b2 (Pfizer/BioNTech) could be fewer than 20 cases per million (low certainty). Incidence after a third dose of an mRNA vaccine had very low certainty evidence. For individuals of 18–29 years, incidence of myocarditis is probably higher after vaccination with mRNA-1273 (Moderna) compared with Pfizer (moderate certainty). Among individuals aged 12–17, 18–29, or 18–39 years, incidence of myocarditis or pericarditis after dose two of an mRNA vaccine for covid-19 might be lower when administered ≥ 31 days compared with ≤ 30 days after dose one (low certainty). Data specific to men aged 18–29 years indicated that the dosing interval might need to increase to ≥ 56 days to substantially drop myocarditis or pericarditis incidence. For clinical course and short term outcomes, only one small case series (n = 8) was found for 5–11 year olds. In adolescents and adults, most (> 90%) myocarditis cases involved men of a median 20–30 years of age and with symptom onset two to four days after a second dose (71–100%). Most people were admitted to hospital (≥ 84%) for a short duration (two to four days). For pericarditis, data were limited but more variation than myocarditis has been reported in patient age, sex, onset timing, and rate of admission to hospital. Three case series with longer term (3 months; n = 38) follow-up suggested persistent echocardiogram abnormalities, as well as ongoing symptoms or a need for drug treatments or restriction from activities in > 50% of patients. Sixteen hypothesised mechanisms were described, with little direct supporting or refuting evidence.

Conclusions

These findings indicate that adolescent and young adult men are at the highest risk of myocarditis after mRNA vaccination. Use of a Pfizer vaccine over a Moderna vaccine and waiting for more than 30 days between doses might be preferred for this population. Incidence of myocarditis in children aged 5–11 years is very rare but certainty was low. Data for clinical risk factors were very limited. A clinical course of mRNA related myocarditis appeared to be benign, although longer term follow-up data were limited. Prospective studies with appropriate testing (eg, biopsy and tissue morphology) will enhance understanding of mechanism.

### Immune checkpoint inhibitor-associated myocarditis [^117MrHzW]. The Oncologist (2018). Low credibility.

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are approved for a wide range of malignancies. They work by priming the immune system response to cancer and have changed the landscape of available cancer treatments. As anticipated, modulation of the regulatory controls in the immune system with ICIs results in diverse immune-related adverse events, targeting any organ or gland. These toxicities are rarely fatal and generally regress after treatment discontinuation and/or prescription of corticosteroids. Recently, several cases of ICI-related cardiotoxicity have been reported with complications ranging from cardiogenic shock to sudden death. The true incidence of ICI-associated myocarditis is likely underestimated, due to a combination of factors including the lack of specificity in the clinical presentation, the potential of overlap with other cardiovascular and general medical illnesses, the challenges in the diagnosis, and a general lack of awareness of this condition. Currently, there are no clear guidelines for surveillance, diagnosis, or management of this entity. There are multiple unresolved issues including, but not limited to, identifying those at risk of this uncommon toxicity, elucidating the pathophysiology, determining if and what type of surveillance is appropriate, optimal work-up of suspected patients, and methods for resolution of myocarditis. Here we describe a clinical vignette and discuss the salient features and management strategies of ICI-associated myocarditis.

Key Points

The incidence of immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)-associated myocarditis is unclear and has been reported to range from 0.06% to 1% of patients prescribed an ICI. Myocarditis may be difficult to diagnose. The risk factors for ICI-associated myocarditis are not well understood but may include underlying autoimmune disease and diabetes mellitus. The prevalence of myocarditis has been reported to be higher with combination immune therapies. Myocarditis with ICI's typically occurs early, with an elevated troponin, may present with an normal left ventricular ejection fraction and may have a fulminant course. The optimal management of myocarditis associated with ICI's is unclear but most cases are treated with high-dose steroids.

### High risk and low prevalence diseases: myocarditis [^1155auJQ]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Myocarditis is a serious condition that carries with it a high rate of morbidity and mortality.

Objective

This review highlights the pearls and pitfalls of myocarditis, including presentation, diagnosis, and management in the emergency department (ED) based on current evidence.

Discussion

Myocarditis is an inflammatory syndrome of myocardium, most often resulting from a viral infection, that can cause life-threatening cardiovascular collapse. It has a highly variable presentation and no widely available specific diagnostic test, making it a challenging diagnosis. Emergency clinicians should obtain an electrocardiogram and perform bedside ultrasound to assess cardiac function. Treatment in the ED is largely supportive, focusing on resuscitation, cardiovascular support, cardiology specialist consultation, and appropriate disposition.

Conclusions

An understanding of myocarditis can assist emergency clinicians in diagnosing and managing this potentially deadly disease.

### The global, regional, and national burden of myocarditis in 204 countries and territories, 1990–2021: results from the global burden of disease study 2021 [^113aGLfx]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2024). Medium credibility.

Aims

To estimate the global burden of myocarditis in the general population from 1990 to 2021.

Methods and Results

Data on myocarditis were retrieved from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2021. Incidence, deaths, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), along with their age-standardized rates (ASRs) per 100000 population, were used to measure the burden of myocarditis. Global, regional, and national analyses were performed for the period between 1990 and 2021. Further sub-analyses were conducted based on age group, sex, and sociodemographic index (SDI). In 2021, there were 1.3 million (95% uncertainty interval [UI]: 1.1 to 1.6) incident cases, 31.7 thousand (95% UI: 25.5 to 37.1) deaths, and 96.3 thousand (95% UI: 79.6 to 114.8) DALY cases globally. The ASRs of incidence, death, and DALYs significantly decreased from 1990 to 2021, with percentage changes of -3.9% (95% UI: -4.7% to -2.9%), -28.2% (95% UI: -42.2% to -12.5%), and -37.8% (95% UI: -50.5% to -24.3%), respectively. The global burden of myocarditis was higher in males, children, and the elderly. Additionally, the burden of myocarditis varied widely across different SDI regions, with high SDI regions having the highest ASR of incidence, and high-middle SDI regions having the highest ASRs of deaths and DALYs.

Conclusion

Although the ASRs of incidence, deaths, and DALYs significantly decreased from 1990 to 2021, the global number of incidences, deaths, and DALYs increased substantially. Certain populations, including males, children, the elderly, and regions with advanced sociodemographic levels, experienced a heavier burden of myocarditis.

### Incidence, risk factors, natural history, and hypothesised mechanisms of myocarditis and pericarditis following COVID-19 vaccination: living evidence syntheses and review [^115eSSq9]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

We assessed the certainty for each of our conclusion statements using Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) guidance. We did not apply a threshold for an important incidence rate, but in general, we considered fewer than 20 cases per million doses to be very rare. For question two, associations (odds ratio or relative risk) of 1.5 or more were considered clinically relevant (ie, odds ratio < 1.5 shows little-to-no association). Observational studies for incident rates (question one) started at low certainty (ie, our confidence in the incident rate is limited; the true rate might be substantially different from the estimate) and studies on risk factors (question two) started at high certainty(ie, we are very confident that the true difference in rate between risk groups lies close to the estimate). We rated down for serious concerns about risk of bias, inconsistency or absence of consistency (single study), indirectness, imprecision, or reporting biases. We rated down for risk of bias when only studies having high risk for case ascertainment contributed to an outcome (eg, passive surveillance where we assume there is under-ascertainment). We also rated down for indirectness for comparisons across both sexes or if the age group reported did not match one of our groups of interest (eg, 13–39 year olds) and the incident rates could vary substantially among ages. We rated down for imprecision in groups with fewer people than would be expected for one event to occur based on estimated baseline incidence rates (eg, a subgroup with 8000 people but reporting zero events). We considered uprating when incidence rates were large (eg, twice or more than our 20 per million threshold) when no other major limitations were evident and we had moderate confidence in our conclusion, often reported as a range of incidences. In our conclusions, we have used the terms probably, might, and uncertain to reflect, respectively, moderate, low, or very low certainty of evidence based on GRADE. When we have very low certainty, we made no conclusions about specific incident rates or other outcomes.

For questions three and four, we present the details for each case series in an evidence table and provide a descriptive summary. For question five, we present a summary of the mechanisms and a more descriptive table.

### Myocarditis in the setting of cancer therapeutics: proposed case definitions for emerging clinical syndromes in cardio-oncology [^113WhKdM]. Circulation (2019). Medium credibility.

Recent developments in cancer therapeutics have improved outcomes but have also been associated with cardiovascular complications. Therapies harnessing the immune system have been associated with an immune-mediated myocardial injury described as myocarditis. Immune checkpoint inhibitors are one such therapy with an increasing number of case and cohort reports describing a clinical syndrome of immune checkpoint inhibitor–associated myocarditis. Although the full spectrum of immune checkpoint inhibitor–associated cardiovascular disease still needs to be fully defined, described cases of myocarditis range from syndromes with mild signs and symptoms to fatal events. These observations in the clinical setting stand in contrast to outcomes from randomized clinical trials in which myocarditis is a rare event that is investigator reported and lacking in a specific case definition. The complexities associated with diagnosis, as well as the heterogeneous clinical presentation of immune checkpoint inhibitor–associated myocarditis, have made ascertainment and identification of myocarditis with high specificity challenging in clinical trials and other data sets, limiting the ability to better understand the incidence, outcomes, and predictors of these rare events. Therefore, establishing a uniform definition of myocarditis for application in clinical trials of cancer immunotherapies will enable greater understanding of these events. We propose an operational definition of cancer therapy-associated myocarditis that may facilitate case ascertainment and report and therefore may enhance the understanding of the incidence, outcomes, and risk factors of this novel clinical syndrome.

Prediction of the myocarditis-related disease burden

The results indicated that the number of myocarditis-related incidence and death would increase from 2021 to 2035, and DALYs would decrease during the same period (online supplemental eFigure 10). However, the ASIR, ASMR and ASDR of myocarditis will decrease from 2021 to 2035 (online supplemental eFigure 11).

### COVID-19, myocarditis and pericarditis [^113NCCCa]. Circulation Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Epidemiology of COVID-19 Myocarditis/Pericarditis

The latest Global Burden of Disease statistics before the COVID-19 pandemic place the worldwide prevalence of myocarditis and cardiomyopathy at 10.2 to 105.6 cases/100 000 individuals. A recent study estimated pre-COVID myocarditis in the United States at 1 to 10 cases/100 000 individuals (Table 1). The incidence of acute pericarditis pre-COVID in a large Finnish registry of all cardiovascular patients (n = 670 409) was 3.3 cases/100 000 individuals. Many epidemiology studies of myocarditis in patients with COVID-19 have been conducted since the pandemic started, with some of the larger studies listed in. The overall incidence of myocarditis in the United States from SARS-CoV-2 infection has been estimated in a study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention at around 150 cases/100 000 versus 9 cases/100 000 individuals in non-COVID cases during the same time period (Table 1). A separate study in the United States and Europe estimated 240 cases/100 000 individuals of definite or probable myocarditis and 410 cases/100 000 individuals for possible myocarditis (Table 1). These data indicate around a ≥ 15-fold increased risk of developing myocarditis from SARS-CoV-2 infection compared with other causes (Table 1).

### Incidence, risk factors, natural history, and hypothesised mechanisms of myocarditis and pericarditis following COVID-19 vaccination: living evidence syntheses and review [^112vqi9q]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Strengths and limitations of the review

This review had several strengths. We used a comprehensive, peer reviewed search strategy and included grey literature to capture recent data. A second reviewer screened the most relevant citations (based on machine learning) and verified all data and risk of bias assessments. GRADE assessments were based on team consensus including clinical experts. Patient partners reviewed the evidence and developed interpretations from the patient perspective.

The main limitation of our review was that the covid-19 literature base is evolving rapidly with new evidence constantly emerging; nevertheless, some of our review findings were associated with moderate certainty evidence. Furthermore, one or more updates are planned and will be made publicly accessible via the COVID-END website. Because of apparent differences in presentation between myocarditis and pericarditis after vaccination seen in our original review and different long term sequelae, we analysed these outcomes separately where possible. Although myocarditis and pericarditis often coexist, the former is more easily diagnosed due to the presence of elevated cardiac troponin or imaging findings on cardiac MRI. Conversely, pericarditis is often diagnosed based on chest pain symptoms and findings on echocardiogram, and given this subjectivity; related data are likely less robust.

In some cases, authors clearly considered the term myopericarditis to include myocarditis, pericarditis, or both; whereas in others this distinction was not transparent and use of these data for rates of myocarditis and myopericarditis might overestimate the incidence to a small degree. Furthermore, our eligibility criterium of requiring case confirmation was not limited to use of any particular criteria and, in some cases, the clinician diagnosis might not have been based on current definitions. Therefore, these criteria could lead to some over or under ascertainment. None of the studies performed cardiac MRI or biopsy on all patients and, as such, most cases are considered probable (v definitive) at best and any subclinical cases would not have been identified. We are unaware of any other comprehensive examination, and critique, of existing descriptions of the potential mechanisms that might be involved in myocarditis associated with covid-19 vaccination. We might have missed some mechanistic studies because we added this question for this update, after the original review was completed.

Question 1: incidence of myocarditis and pericarditis after covid-19 vaccination

We included 14 studies (reported in publications, presentations, online reports, accessible data; all are considered here as studies for simplicity), with eight that used active surveillance data sources (eg, medical records or registries) and six that used passive reporting systems. Data came from the US, Canada, the UK, Israel, Denmark, Singapore, and internationally (Moderna Global Safety Database). Four studies used the US Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System for cases, and populations overlapped in analyses for young people aged 5–11and 12–17years in which two reports were included for each group because they applied different risk intervals (seven days and any duration). Four studies included a comparator group or background rate to estimate excess incidence rates. All studies on myocarditis reported on incident rates by age and sex; the only study reporting on pericarditis by age (5–11 years) reported data for both sexes. Risk of bias was rated as some concerns (n = 2) and high (n = 6), mostly from no adjustment for variables other than age and sex) for studies using data from active surveillance systems and rated as high for all six studies using passive surveillance data.

Table 1 includes the results by study, the conclusions for each age and sex category, and the GRADE certainty assessments. We refer to studies by their source of adverse event data and the date of data collection; references for each study using this format are in appendix 3.

### Incidence of immune checkpoint inhibitor-induced myocarditis during the COVID-19 pandemic [^115hxSU7]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Figure 1
Incidence of immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) myocarditis before and during the COVID‐19 pandemic.

The red line depicts the incidence of myocarditis expressed as the percentage of myocarditis cases per total number of ICI recipients for each 6‐month interval beginning January 1, 2019. The blue bars represent patients taking single‐agent ICI therapy, and the yellow bars denote those taking combination ICI therapy for each 6‐month interval. Before 2019, these bars reflect the average number of patients taking single and dual ICIs, respectively, from June 14, 2014 to December 31, 2018. The green line depicts the total number of COVID‐19 cases. The timing of COVID‐19 variants is approximated based on the predominance of the circulating COVID‐19 variants in the United States.

This is the first observation of a possible relationship between the COVID‐19 pandemic and ICI myocarditis, with similar incidence trajectories. The incidence of ICI myocarditis increased during the COVID‐19 pandemic, then rapidly declined after the Delta surge, despite a growing number of patients taking ICIs, implementation of routine monitoring protocols, and similar rates of dual ICI use. While the reason for this observation is unclear, several large studies have identified a substantial increase in the incidence of various autoimmune diseases after SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. The association between COVID‐19 and autoimmune diseases is thought to be due to the virus's ability to disrupt self‐tolerance and trigger autoimmune reactions via cross‐reactivity. Immunoinflammatory responses can persist for months after SARS‐CoV‐2 infection (an effect more prominent with the earlier viral variants) and could increase the risk of aberrant immune activations in patients receiving ICIs. While the increased vigilance and screening for ICI myocarditis may have influenced its higher detection rates after March 2020, the subsequent decline in incidence to prepandemic levels after 2022 suggests other factors are at play.

The strengths of this study include the systematic collection of data of all patients taking ICIs at the University of Michigan, allowing for accurate assessment of the incidence of myocarditis. Despite its large sample size, this remains a single‐center observational study in which the findings warrant external validation and cannot establish causation, especially since COVID‐19 exposure of patients with ICI myocarditis could not be confirmed, and unknown confounders could not be accounted for. Nevertheless, these findings are supported by several observations supporting a link between autoimmunity and COVID‐19 and has important implications for ongoing and future clinical trials on therapeutic strategies for ICI myocarditis.

A clinical consensus document supported by the heart failure association of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and the ESC working group on myocardial and pericardial diseases [^116hLoQp]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2022). Medium credibility.

Over 10 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines based on RNA technology, viral vectors, recombinant protein, and inactivated virus have been administered worldwide. Although generally very safe, post-vaccine myocarditis can result from adaptive humoral and cellular, cardiac-specific inflammation within days and weeks of vaccination. Rates of vaccine-associated myocarditis vary by age and sex with the highest rates in males between 12 and 39years. The clinical course is generally mild with rare cases of left ventricular dysfunction, heart failure and arrhythmias. Mild cases are likely underdiagnosed as cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) is not commonly performed even in suspected cases and not at all in asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic patients. Hospitalization of symptomatic patients with electrocardiographic changes and increased plasma troponin levels is considered necessary in the acute phase to monitor for arrhythmias and potential decline in left ventricular function. In addition to evaluation for symptoms, electrocardiographic changes and elevated troponin levels, CMR is the best non-invasive diagnostic tool with endomyocardial biopsy being restricted to severe cases with heart failure and/or arrhythmias. The management beyond guideline-directed treatment of heart failure and arrhythmias includes non-specific measures to control pain. Anti-inflammatory drugs such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and corticosteroids have been used in more severe cases, with only anecdotal evidence for their effectiveness. In all age groups studied, the overall risks of SARS-CoV-2 infection-related hospitalization and death are hugely greater than the risks from post-vaccine myocarditis. This consensus statement serves as a practical resource for physicians in their clinical practice, to understand, diagnose, and manage affected patients. Furthermore, it is intended to stimulate research in this area.

The prevalence and related mortality of cardiomyopathy and myocarditis increase throughout adulthood in both sexes, with a larger proportion of cases in men than in women. When myocarditis alone is considered, a similar trend was observed. Referring to 2019, in the age between 35 and 39 years, when myocarditis can commonly occur, the rate of myocarditis is 6.1 per 100,000 (95% UI: 4.2 to 8.7 per 100,000) in men and 4.4 per 100,000 (95% UI: 3.0 to 6.3 per 100,000) in women. Similar figures can be found in the range of ages between 20 and 44 years.

The increased prevalence associated with aging is more pronounced in cardiomyopathies than in myocarditis. Approximately a 6-fold higher age-related increase of other cardiomyopathy was observed in men between 35 and 39 years (10.8 per 100,000 [95% UI: 6.5 to 17.4 per 100,000]) versus those between 80 and 84 years (698.5 per 100,000 [95% UI: 429.6 to 1064.8 per 100,000]) compared with myocarditis in men of 35 to 39 years (6.1 per 100,000 [95% UI: 4.2 to 8.7 per 100,00]) versus those of 80 to 84 years (63.0 per 100,000 [95% UI: 43.6 to 87.9 per 100,000]). The relatively greater rise of other cardiomyopathy compared to myocarditis prevalence with age is constant, from 1990 to 2019.

Myocarditis-related mortality rate between 35 and 39 years was 0.2 per 100,000 (95% UI: 0.2 to 0.3 per 100,000) in men compared to 0.1 per 100,000 (95% UI: 0.1 to 0.2 per 100,000) in women in 2019. Alternatively, myocarditis resulted in death in 1 in 72 men (585 deaths per 42,200 incident cases) and 1 in 87 (324 deaths per 28,100 incident cases) women in this age bracket who were diagnosed in 2019. Between ages 80 and 84 years, the rate was higher, at 1 death for every 19 incident cases of myocarditis in men (1,800 deaths per 34,400 incident cases) and 1 death for every 15 incident cases of myocarditis in women (2,260 deaths per 34,900 incident cases).

Myocarditis

Myocarditis is a disease of myocardial inflammation with an estimated global incidence of 10–22 per 100,000 people. Studies suggest it is even more common in children, with an incidence in pediatric autopsy studies as high as 1.8%. Clinical phenotypes are heterogeneous and include subclinical disease, a mild coronary syndrome-like presentation, fulminant disease with heart failure and cardiogenic shock, and SCD. Most patients experience complete resolution of symptoms, others develop DCM and chronic heart failure, and still others require long-term mechanical circulatory support or heart transplantation. The underlying etiologies of myocarditis are also varied and include infectious, autoimmune, hypersensitivity, and toxic causes. Most frequently, acute myocarditis is associated with common viral infections. Some patients will clear the virus and improve while others will develop a chronic inflammatory state, which may be related to persistence of virus in the myocardium. – Yet, the underlying explanation for why some patients develop myocarditis and what factors determine the clinical course of disease has not been fully elucidated.

Myocarditis — registries and further research priorities state that international registries for myocarditis are necessary to enable large-scale detection of characteristics and patterns and that a shared international definition with similar diagnostic standards will be paramount for data comparability. Registry data are described as useful to obtain an in-depth understanding of pathophysiology, discover risk predictors, learn about clinical course, and identify novel trends, while multicenter clinical trials are at least as important when novel therapies are tested and innovative trial methods should be considered because most therapies had been tested in small single-center studies that did not provide sufficient evidence; due to the absence of standardized therapy guidelines, treatment varies significantly, making it essential to establish uniform treatment protocols. Partnerships with industry, academic centers, and patient advocacy groups are needed for multicenter, international registries, and decentralized enrollment structures with specialized clinical research centers should be considered. There is a critical need to capture myocarditis as a diagnosis because the International Classification of Diseases-Tenth Revision code may not be used in cases that are missed or not hospitalized; thus, there may be gross under-reporting, and defining epidemiology, including true incidence and prevalence, mortality, and outcomes, needs further study. The psychosocial, socioeconomic, and healthcare burden is considerable, with long-term follow-up reporting that up to one-third of patients with fulminant myocarditis requiring mechanical circulatory support had severe anxiety or depressive symptoms and were at risk for post-traumatic stress disorder, and economic burden at the individual or healthcare level has not been studied and requires further research.

### COVID-19, myocarditis and pericarditis [^116njpLo]. Circulation Research (2023). Medium credibility.

COVID-19 Vaccine–Associated Myocarditis and Pericarditis

Not long after COVID-19 vaccination began in the general population, case reports appeared identifying myocarditis and pericarditis as a side effect of vaccination, especially after the second dose. Since that time, many large, population-based epidemiology studies have been conducted around the world that report myocarditis/pericarditis after vaccination (reviewed in the study by Heidecker et al). Many COVID-19 vaccines have been developed using various platforms and with several names for the same vaccine (summarized in). The reported incidence of myocarditis or pericarditis varies widely depending on the vaccine type and how many doses were administered, with the highest levels reported for the Moderna mRNA vaccine, with an overall incidence of ≈10/100 000 and around 50/100 000 in men under 40 years of age (Table 1). All reports agree that the greatest risk of developing myocarditis occurs after the second vaccine dose in young men aged 12 to 39 years. Ages past 50 years had few reports of vaccine-associated myocarditis, similar to pre- and COVID-19–associated myocarditis. It is difficult to compare these incidence figures to prepandemic cases as previous reports did not typically report myocarditis by sex and age (or race).

Myocarditis or pericarditis

For homologous versus heterologous vaccine for dose two, among adults aged 18–29 and 18–39 years and men aged 18–29 years, little to no difference is predicted in the incidence of myocarditis or pericarditis after mRNA vaccination with a heterologous dose two (mixed Moderna and Pfizer with either for dose two) compared with homologous dose two (low certainty). For adults ≥ 40 years old, we are uncertain about any difference in the incidence of myocarditis/pericarditis after mRNA vaccination with a heterologous dose two compared with homologous dose two (very low certainty).

Considering dose intervals, among individuals aged 12–17, 18–29, and 18–39 years, the incidence of myocarditis or pericarditis after dose two of an mRNA vaccine might be lower when administered 31 days or more compared with 30 days or less after dose one (low certainty). Data specific to men aged 18–29 indicated that the dosing interval might need to increase to 56 days or more to substantially drop incidence. For 18–29 year olds, the proportional decrease in incidence of myocarditis or pericarditis after dose two of an mRNA vaccine when administered 31 days or more compared with 30 days or less after dose one might be similar for Moderna and Pfizer (low certainty). This proportional decrease might be smaller with Moderna compared with Pfizer for 18–39 year olds (low certainty). Among people aged 40 years or older, incidence of myocarditis or pericarditis after dose two of an mRNA vaccine might be higher when administered 31 days or more compared with 30 days or less after dose one (low certainty). In this group, the proportional increase in incidence of myocarditis or pericarditis after dose two when administered 31 days or more compared with 30 days or less after dose one might be greater for Moderna compared with Pfizer.

We are uncertain if people with immunocompromised or inflammatory conditions have a different risk of myocarditis after mRNA vaccination (very low certainty from single studies using passive reporting systems without case confirmation and having inadequate sample sizes).

Question 2: risk factors

In this question, we assessed the relative differences in outcomes across subgroups. It is important to note, however, that these relative results must be taken in context with question one findings reporting on incidence; the relative differences in subgroups in female patients and older age groups should be given less weight in policy decision-making, based on the very low-to-no incidence of myocarditis after mRNA vaccination in these groups.

Myocarditis

For Moderna versus Pfizer, after dose two, in people aged 18–29 years, and men aged 18–39 years, the incidence of myocarditis is probably higher after vaccination with Moderna compared with Pfizer (moderate certainty; table 2). For women aged 18–39 years, the incidence of myocarditis might be higher after vaccination with Moderna compared with Pfizer (low certainty). For people aged 30–39 years, little to no difference might be expected in the incidence of myocarditis after vaccination with Moderna compared with Pfizer (low certainty). Among individuals aged ≥ 40 years, myocarditis after vaccination with Moderna compared with Pfizer is probably little to no difference (moderate certainty).

Data synthesis and certainty assessments

For question one, we did not pool results due to heterogeneity in case finding (passive v active surveillance), dosing and risk intervals, age groupings, and, in some cases, some degree of overlap in cases expected between studies. We tabulated all results and compared and contrasted findings between studies based on the major differentiating population, vaccine, and methodological variables. We report the range in incidence rates across studies, or, when all rates are low, concluded that the incidence is fewer than 20 cases per million, which, based on our clinical investigator input, we considered very rare. Based on input from clinicians and our knowledge users from Public Health Agency of Canada, we developed the key age categories (0–4, 5–11, 12–17, and 18–29 years) to rely on when possible. If a study contributed more than one result within these (eg, 20–24 and 25–29, results for each mRNA vaccine) we calculated a weighted average (eg, by proportion of years in the age range) of the incident rates. When a study reported an incidence rate (or data to calculate this) and an incidence rate ratio compared with a control or background rate, but not the difference in incidence (excess incidence over background rate), we calculated the excess incidence (ie, crude incidence − (crude incidence/ incidence rate ratio)).

### COVID-19, myocarditis and pericarditis [^1171wFxj]. Circulation Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Viral infections are a leading cause of myocarditis and pericarditis worldwide, conditions that frequently coexist. Myocarditis and pericarditis were some of the early comorbidities associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19. Many epidemiologic studies have been conducted since that time concluding that SARS-CoV-2 increased the incidence of myocarditis/pericarditis at least 15× over pre-COVID levels although the condition remains rare. The incidence of myocarditis pre-COVID was reported at 1 to 10 cases/100 000 individuals and with COVID ranging from 150 to 4000 cases/100 000 individuals. Before COVID-19, some vaccines were reported to cause myocarditis and pericarditis in rare cases, but the use of novel mRNA platforms led to a higher number of reported cases than with previous platforms providing new insight into potential pathogenic mechanisms. The incidence of COVID-19 vaccine-associated myocarditis/pericarditis covers a large range depending on the vaccine platform, age, and sex examined. Importantly, the findings highlight that myocarditis occurs predominantly in male patients aged 12 to 40 years regardless of whether the cause was due to a virus-like SARS-CoV-2 or associated with a vaccine-a demographic that has been reported before COVID-19. This review discusses findings from COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccine-associated myocarditis and pericarditis considering the known symptoms, diagnosis, management, treatment, and pathogenesis of disease that has been gleaned from clinical research and animal models. Sex differences in the immune response to COVID-19 are discussed, and theories for how mRNA vaccines could lead to myocarditis/pericarditis are proposed. Additionally, gaps in our understanding that need further research are raised.

Results

Clinical characteristics and outcomes

A total of 2,606 adult patients (mean age 64 ± 13 years; 60.7% men) received at least 1 dose of ICI between June 2014 and December 2021. Of these patients, 27 (1.0%) or 0.14 (95% CI: 0.09–0.21) cases per 10,000 person-years had a diagnosis of myocarditis attributed to ICI therapy, of which 5 cases were classified as definite, 4 as probable, and 18 as possible (Supplemental Table 2). The overall number of patients who received ICI therapy and the incidence of ICI myocarditis increased steadily each year from 2014 to 2021 (Supplemental Figure 1). The median time from the first dose of ICI to diagnosis of myocarditis was 28.0 (range, 1–209) days, with 15 (55.6%) patients developing myocarditis within 30 days after the start of ICI therapy.

Epidemiological Characteristics

ICI‐related myocarditis has a reported incidence of 0.04% to 1.14%, but when compared with other IRAEs, it has a significantly higher associated mortality of 25% to 50%. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 In addition, the use of combination ICI therapy has almost twice the incidence of and mortality from myocarditis, although it is still an uncommon adverse event compared with other IRAEs. 2, 3, 5, 6 Salem et al described 122 cases reported from 2008 to 2018 in VigiBase, which is the World Health Organization's global database of individual case safety reports. 6 The study showed increased reporting of myocarditis over time, with only 15 reported cases between 2013 and 2016 compared with 107 reported cases in 2017 and 2018. Myocarditis was reported for patients on ICI disproportionally compared with the full reporting database, with an increased reporting odds ratio of 11.2. 6 The correspondence by Al‐Kindi and Oliveira 7 described 250 ICI‐related myocarditis cases from the US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System, showing the same trend of increased reporting over time, with only 18 reported cases between 2012 and 2015, 70 in 2016, and 162 in 2017. Disproportionality analysis also showed increased reporting odds ratio of 5.94 for myocarditis while on ICI when compared with other cancer therapeutics. 7 Other cardiovascular toxicities have also been reported, including pericardial disease, myocardial infarction, and vasculitis. 6, 7, 8, 9 In a meta‐analysis that included 22 clinical trials of PD‐1 and PD‐L1 inhibitors for lung cancer, the incidence of myocarditis was 0.5%, but the incidence of other cardiovascular toxicities, including pericardial tamponade, myocardial infarction, stroke, cardiac failure, and cardiorespiratory arrest, ranged from 0.7% to 2.0%. 9

Abstract

Background

Myocarditis is a global epidemic that causes various medical conditions associated with an increased incidence and death numbers. This study aimed to investigate the trends in myocarditis-associated incidence, mortality, and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) with health inequalities, risk factors, and predict the disease burden, thereby mitigating the health hazards of myocarditis.

Methods

This was a modelling study that used data from the Global Burden of Diseases 2021, from which myocarditis was included in the analysis. Incidence, death, DALYs, age-standardised incidence rate (ASIR), age-standardised mortality rate (ASMR), age-standardised DALYs rate (ASDR), cases change, corresponding estimated annual percentage change (EAPC), Slope Inequality of Index (SII) and Concentration Index were analysed.

Results

From 1990 to 2021, incidence and death cases increased by 66.88% and 45.94%, respectively. The myocarditis-associated incidence and death cases increased in all five sociodemographic index (SDI) regions. Among the five SDI regions, the High SDI region had the highest myocarditis-associated ASIR with the least ASMR and ASDR in 2021. Regionally, Central Asia had the largest increase in EAPC of ASIR, ASMR and ASDR. Among 204 countries, Japan had the highest ASIR in 2021 and Romania had the highest ASMR and ASDR. Between 1990 and 2021, the SII and Concentration Index for DALYs have shown declining trends. The extreme temperatures were major contributors to the burden of myocarditis during 1990–2021. The projections suggested that the myocarditis-related global number of new cases and death would increase over the next 15 years. There may be upward trends in people of 15+of incidence number and 40+of death and DALYs number.

Conclusions

Myocarditis is an increasing global health challenge with rising incidence and death. Management of extreme temperatures remains a major challenge. The number of incidence, death and DALYs in different age groups would continue to grow over the next 15 years. Therefore, measures should be taken to target risk factors and high-risk groups.

Discussion

Principal findings

Male adolescents and male young adults are at the highest risk of myocarditis after mRNA vaccination for covid-19, and the incidence of myocarditis might be as high as 140 cases per million (1.4 per 10 000). For girls and boys aged 5–11 years and females aged 18–29 years, the incidence of myocarditis after vaccination with Pfizer might be fewer than 20 cases per million although the evidence is of low certainty. Data for incidence rates after a third vaccine dose is limited. For individuals aged 18–29 years, incidence of myocarditis is probably higher after vaccination with Moderna than with Pfizer (moderate certainty). Among individuals aged 12–17, 18–29, and 18–39 years, incidence of myocarditis or pericarditis after dose two of an mRNA vaccine might be lower when administered ≥ 31 days compared with ≤ 30 days after dose one (low certainty). Data specific to males aged 18–29 years indicated that the dosing interval might have needed to increase to ≥ 56 days to substantially drop incidence of these diseases (low certainty). Data for other potential risk factors were very limited. The clinical course of myocarditis in children 5–11 years, for those after a third dose, and for those with previous myocarditis after mRNA vaccination is largely unknown. Although the short term course has consistently shown to be quite mild and self-limiting, more data for longer term prognosis is needed.

Hypothesised mechanisms

Several mechanisms have been hypothesised to account for covid-19 mRNA vaccine associated myocarditis. The hyperimmune or inflammatory response hypothesis raises the question of whether the response is a systemic process or local to the heart. Multi-organ injury is commonly reported in systemic inflammation; however, an isolated cardiac insult is more likely given that most patients manifest chest pain symptoms and measurable changes in cardiac biomarkers and imaging. Although autoimmunity triggered by molecular mimicry or other mechanism is among the more commonly discussed hypothesis, the observed response timing after the second vaccine dose (one to five days) is considered early for this type of mechanism. If mRNA vaccine related myocarditis occurs from exposure to partial antigens (epitopes of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein), then this mechanism should also account for myocarditis after covid-19 infection. Additionally, vaccines using adenoviral vector based platforms produce the spike protein but have not been implicated in acquired myocarditis.

ACC Expert Consensus Decision Pathway — scope, diagnostic framework, and management principles — states that the principal focus is on adults with acute myocarditis, provides new diagnostic criteria, and proposes a new 4-stage classification; management varies by severity, stage, and specific etiology, and identification of specific etiologies is important to allow prompt initiation of appropriate treatment strategies and supportive care. It emphasizes that timely referral of severe myocarditis patients to specialists and medical centers with advanced diagnostic and management capabilities such as transplant and mechanical circulatory support is critically important, and defines indications for referral to allow timely consideration of advanced therapies in high-risk patients. Surveillance strategy, monitoring for recovery, and recommended activity restrictions vary according to severity of presentation, specific etiology, comorbidities, and clinical trajectory, and the document addresses indications for surveillance of recovery and guidance for return to activity. The document also notes that health insurance coverage may not include repeat imaging and/or testing following myocarditis diagnosis or initial testing with advanced imaging in the outpatient setting, even though patients may require repeat diagnostic evaluation to ascertain resolution of previously documented cardiac abnormalities, to define prognosis, and/or for consideration of additional therapies such as guideline-directed management of cardiomyopathy or HF should they develop cardiac dysfunction.

Cardiomyopathy and myocarditis

DALYs due to cardiomyopathy and myocarditis have increased from 7.06 million (95% UI: 6.30 to 8.63 million) to 9.14 million (95% UI: 7.86 to 10.0 million) over the past 30 years, a pattern that is also seen in the rise of deaths from 238,000 (95% UI: 212,000 to 257,000) to 340,000 (95% UI: 285,000 to 371,000) (Supplemental Figure 19A). However, over the same period, the age-standardized rate of death has decreased from 8.0 per 100,000 (95% UI: 6.4 to 8.6 per 100,000) to 5.6 per 100,000 (95% UI: 4.5 to 6.3 per 100,000) in men and 5.8 per 100,000 (95% UI: 4.4 to 6.4 per 100,000) to 3.3 per 100,000 (95% UI: 2.7 to 3.6 per 100,000) in women. The age-standardized morbidity and mortality for men and women in 2019 remains different, at 6.5 per 100,000 YLDs (95% UI: 4.3 to 9.3 per 100,000 YLDs) and 4.2 per 100,000 YLDs (95% UI: 2.8 to 6.0 per 100,000 YLDs) and 148.9 per 100,000 YLLs (95% UI: 120.2 to 168.7 per 100,000 YLLs) and 71.4 per 100,000 YLLs (95% UI: 61.0 to 79.9 per 100,000 YLLs), respectively.

Risk of bias assessment

For questions one and two, all reviewers involved in the risk of bias assessments (JP, LB, LG, and AW) piloted the risk of bias tool with two papers. We used the JBI (formerly Joanna Briggs Institute) checklist for cohort studies, with modifications mainly to ascertain valid risk factor measurement (appendix 2). We focused on valid and reliable case finding and confirmation, and, for question two, accounting for key confounders. Assessments were completed by one reviewer and verified by another. Discrepancies were resolved by discussion or by a review lead.

For questions three and four, we did not assess the risk of bias of the included studies. The intent of these questions was to characterise patients and their clinical course, rather than providing quantitative estimates, for example, of incidence. In this case, we judged the main risk of bias to come from case ascertainment: whether each report includes only cases confirmed or verified by clinicians. To deal with this potential bias, we limited inclusion to confirmed cases (question three part 1 and question four) or extracted this information and considered its potential effect when summarising the results (question three part 2).

Introduction

Myocarditis, defined as inflammatory injury of the heart muscle, can also involve the cardiac conduction system and pericardial layers. This condition can arise from infections, immune-mediated responses, drugs or vaccines. Some patients have decreased cardiac strength, heart rhythm abnormalities or acute heart failure, and even develop cardiogenic shock. Approximately 1–7% of patients die of acute myocarditis. Individuals in all age groups may also be affected. Therefore, accurately assessing the epidemiology of myocarditis is crucial for its prevention, diagnosis and treatment.

The Global Burden of Disease (GBD) database provides extensive epidemiological data for analysing disease burdens of geographical distributions and trends. Based on GBD 2019 data, Wang et al reported that the incidence and death numbers of myocarditis increased from 1990 to 2019. Zhang et al used data from GBD 2019 in youth and middle-aged populations and revealed a global burden of myocarditis among the selected populations. Bao et al applied the age–period–cohort model to delineate the incidence and mortality trends of myocarditis in China. Besides, three studies have analysed data on myocarditis from GBD 2021. However, these three studies were lacking socioeconomic inequality analysis. Both studies failed to incorporate socioeconomic inequality metrics (eg, Slope Inequality of Index (SII) and Concentration Index) to assess disparities in disease burden across income, education or geographical subgroups, limiting insights into health equity. Furthermore, Zhang et al focused exclusively on children aged 0–14 years, omitting global trends and burden patterns in adults and older populations. Li et al did not project future trajectories of myocarditis incidence, death and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) in all age groups, restricting utility for long-term public health planning. In our study, we used the data from the GBD 2021 to analyse trends in the burden of myocarditis, health inequality, its associated risk factors across global, regional and national levels between 1990 and 2021, and provide a reference forecast by 2035 to guide accurate screening and prevention.

Myocarditis staging concept and trajectories — proposal for a 4‑stage approach: Evidence identifies persons at risk of myocarditis without disease, others with subclinical cardiac injury and inflammation, and a spectrum in symptomatic myocarditis from minimal symptoms to severe manifestations including hemodynamic compromise, with variable longitudinal trajectories. These observations are described as similar to the 4‑stage model of heart failure (HF) (stages A to D), and the writing committee believed there would be value in applying a similar 4‑stage approach to patients with myocarditis, while noting that considerable work is needed to define the natural history and therapeutic approaches for the 2 stages ("at‑risk" and "asymptomatic") not typically described.

### Fulminant myocarditis: epidemiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and management [^1122rvKE]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Fulminant myocarditis (FM) is a rare, distinct form of myocarditis that has been difficult to classify. Since 1991, the definition of FM has evolved, and it is currently considered an acute illness with hemodynamic derangement and arrhythmias due to a severe inflammatory process requiring support of cardiac pump function and/or urgent management of serious arrhythmias. Diagnosis is aided through use of biomarkers and cardiac imaging, but endocardial biopsy remains the gold standard. Recent evidence has revealed that patients with FM are significantly more likely to die or require heart transplantation than those with the nonfulminant form, refuting previous studies proposing a paradoxically low mortality in patients with FM. Acute hemodynamic derangement is managed by intensive contemporary pharmacologic and interventional approaches, whereas the role of immunosuppressive therapy has not been clarified. Early recognition and aggressive management are essential for favorable outcomes. In conclusion, FM is an inflammatory process requiring intensive support, and it causes a higher morbidity and mortality than acute nonfulminant myocarditis.

### Occurrence and features of childhood myocarditis: a nationwide study in Finland [^117JVfDX]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Epidemiology of myocarditis in childhood is largely unknown. Men are known to have a higher incidence of myocarditis than women in adults aged < 50 years, but whether this is true by sex in pediatric age groups is unknown. We set out to study the occurrence and potential sex differences of myocarditis in a general pediatric population.

Methods and Results

Data of all hospital admissions with myocarditis in Finland occurring in patients aged ≤ 15 years from 2004 to 2014 were collected from a mandatory nationwide registry. All patients with myocarditis as a primary, secondary, or tertiary cause of admission were included. Total and age‐ and sexspecific incidence rates were calculated using corresponding population data. There were 213 admissions with myocarditis in pediatric patients. Myocarditis was the primary cause of admission in 86%. The overall incidence rate of myocarditis was 1.95/100 000 person‐years. Of all patients, 77% were boys, but sex differences in incidence rates were age‐dependent. In children aged 0 to 5 years, there was no sex difference in the occurrence of myocarditis. Boys aged 6 to 10 years had a higher incidence rate compared with girls (72% boys; incidence rate ratio: 2.46; 95% confidence interval, 1.03–5.89; P = 0.04). Sex difference further increased in children aged 11 to 15 years (80% boys; incidence rate ratio: 3.5; 95% confidence interval, 2.68–5.67; P < 0.0001).

Conclusions

Myocarditis leading to hospital admission is relatively uncommon in children, but occurrence of myocarditis increases with age. There is no sex difference in the risk of myocarditis during the first 6 years of life, but boys have a significantly higher risk at ages 6 to 15 years.

Diagnosis of myocarditis — clinical symptoms: The initial step for a clinician in the assessment of a patient with possible myocarditis is to recognize that a clinical scenario is consistent with this diagnosis, and clinicians should be aware of 3 classic presentations — chest pain, arrhythmia, or heart failure (HF)/cardiogenic shock. The history of an antecedent viral infection in a young person, a prior diagnosis of myocarditis or autoimmune disease, a family history of cardiomyopathy or unexplained sudden death, or exposure to known cardiotoxin followed by related symptoms should raise the suspicion for this condition.

### What is the evidence of the diagnostic Criteria and screening of immune checkpoint inhibitor-induced myocarditis? [^11189PD4]. JACC: CardioOncology (2022). Medium credibility.

What are the Diagnostic Strategies?

Myocarditis is an inflammatory condition of the myocardium most often related to viral infection. The diagnosis is suspected based on clinical context, symptoms, and associated test abnormalities including electrocardiogram (ECG), and circulating and imaging markers of myocardial injury. Because such findings are not specific for myocarditis, other causes of myocardial injury (eg, acute coronary syndrome [ACS]) must be excluded. Endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) can confirm the diagnosis by demonstrating inflammatory infiltrations with or without myocyte degeneration or necrosis of nonischemic origin.EMB is not routinely performed because of the risk of procedural complications and a sensitivity that varies widely according to pretest probability, timing, sampling site, myocarditis type, and analytic methods. Cardiac MRI (CMR) is considered the best noninvasive imaging modality for the diagnosis of myocarditis based on the 2018-Lake Louise (2018-LL) criteria, which identify major criteria, including edema and nonischemic myocardial injury. Myocardial edema is evidenced by global or regional T2 elevation or hypersignal on T2-weighted sequences. Nonischemic myocardial injury is demonstrated by late enhancement (LGE), global or regional native T1 elevation, and/or extracellular volume fraction in a nonischemic distribution. In the presence of 2 major criteria, the sensitivity and specificity of 2018-LL criteria are 88% and 96%, respectively.

### Systematic review and meta-analysis of myocarditis and pericarditis in adolescents following COVID-19 BNT162b2 vaccination [^114wz2Ys]. NPJ Vaccines (2023). Medium credibility.

Myocarditis and pericarditis are frequent complications of COVID-19, but have also been reported following vaccination against COVID-19 in adolescents. To build vaccine confidence and inform policy, we characterized the incidence of myocarditis/pericarditis in adolescents following BNT162b2 vaccination and explored the association with dose and sex. We searched national and international databases for studies reporting the incidence of myocarditis/pericarditis following BNT162b2 vaccination as the primary endpoint. The intra-study risk of bias was appraised, and random-effects meta-analyses were performed to estimate the pooled incidence by dose stratified by sex. The pooled incidence of myocarditis/pericarditis was 4.5 (95%CI: 3.14–6.11) per 100,000 vaccinations across all doses. Compared to dose 1, the risk was significantly higher after dose 2 (RR: 8.62, 95%CI: 5.71–13.03). However, adolescents experienced a low risk after a booster dose than after dose 2 (RR: 0.06; 95%CI: 0.04–0.09). Males were approximately seven times (RR: 6.66, 95%CI: 4.77–4.29) more likely than females to present myocarditis/pericarditis. In conclusion, we found a low frequency of myocarditis/pericarditis after BNT162b2, which occurred predominantly after the second dose in male adolescents. The prognosis appears to be favorable, with full recovery in both males and females. National programs are recommended to adopt the causality framework to reduce overreporting, which undercuts the value of the COVID-19 vaccine on adolescent life, as well as to extend the inter-dose interval policy, which has been linked to a lower frequency of myocarditis/pericarditis.

### Myocarditis in patients starting combination checkpoint inhibitor therapy: analysis of a commercial claims database [^1117Vcvy]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

In this large population‐based cohort of patients receiving checkpoint therapy, the incidence of myocarditis was low; however, the risk of this complication more than doubled in patients taking combination therapy with nivolumab and ipilimumab. Myocarditis occurred most often within 100 days of commencing treatment. No increased risk for heart failure following myocarditis was seen in patients receiving combination therapy.

This study supports the increasing role of large pharmacoepidemiologic studies based on longitudinal data routinely generated in the provision of health care for millions of patients with cancer, which can provide important information on the safety of novel therapies in clinical practice; in particular, serious adverse events with low incidence rates.

For girls and boys aged 5–11 years, the incidence of myocarditis after vaccination with Pfizer might be fewer than 20 cases per million in both groups (low certainty). The incidence of myocarditis after mRNA vaccines is highest in male adolescents and male young adults (12–17 years, range 50–139 cases per million (low certainty); 18–29 years, 28–147 per million (moderate certainty)). For 18–39 year old male individuals, the incidence of myocarditis might be between 25 and 82 cases per million (low certainty). Among female individuals 18–29 years of age, the incidence of myocarditis after vaccination might be less than 20 cases per million (low certainty). We are very uncertain about the incidence of myocarditis after vaccination with mRNA vaccines in girls aged 12–17, people aged 30–39 years, and in women aged 18–39 years (very low certainty from risk of bias and inconsistency).

Myocarditis after dose three

Among men who are 40 years or older, the incidence of myocarditis after a third dose of an mRNA vaccines might be fewer than 20 cases per million (low certainty). For individuals aged 13–39 years and women 40 years or older, we are uncertain about the incidence of myocarditis after a third dose of an mRNA vaccine due to concerns about imprecision and inconsistency from multiple studies (very low certainty).

Pericarditis

Based on one study only reporting across both sexes, we are uncertain about the incidence of pericarditis after Pfizer vaccination in children aged 5–11 years old (very low certainty).

### Incidence and risk factors of myocarditis in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 [^111KDdiu]. Journal of Medical Virology (2023). Medium credibility.

Myocarditis as cardiac involvement in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-infection is well known. Real-world data about incidence in hospitalized COVID-19-patients and risk factors for myocarditis in COVID-19-patients are sparse. We used the German nationwide inpatient sample to analyze all hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19-diagnosis in Germany in 2020 and stratified them for myocarditis. Overall, 176137 hospitalizations (52.3% males, 53.6% aged ≥ 70 years) with confirmed COVID-19-infection were coded in Germany in 2020 and among them, 226 (0.01%) had myocarditis (incidence: 1.28 per 1000 hospitalization-cases). Absolute numbers of myocarditis increased, while relative numbers decreased with age. COVID-19-patients with myocarditis were younger (64.0 [IQR: 43.0/78.0] vs. 71.0 [56.0/82.0], p < 0.001). In-hospital case-fatality was 1.3-fold higher in COVID-19-patients with than without myocarditis (24.3% vs. 18.9%, p = 0.012). Myocarditis was independently associated with increased case-fatality (OR: 1.89 [95% CI: 1.33–2.67], p < 0.001). Independent risk factors for myocarditis were age < 70 years (OR: 2.36 [95% CI: 1.72–3.24], p < 0.001), male sex (1.68 [95% CI: 1.28–2.23], p < 0.001), pneumonia (OR: 1.77 [95% CI: 1.30–2.42], p < 0.001), and multisystemic inflammatory COVID-19-infection (OR: 10.73 [95% CI: 5.39–21.39], p < 0.001). The incidence of myocarditis in hospitalized COVID-19-patients in Germany was 1.28 cases per 1000 hospitalizations in 2020. Risk factors for myocarditis in COVID-19 were young age, male sex, pneumonia, and multisystemic inflammatory COVID-19-infection. Myocarditis was independently associated with increased case-fatality.

### What is the evidence of the diagnostic Criteria and screening of immune checkpoint inhibitor-induced myocarditis? [^112KSwut]. JACC: CardioOncology (2022). Medium credibility.

Table 1
International Cardio-Oncology Definition for Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor Myocarditis

Both the Bonaca and IC-OS definitions suggest the use of the 2018-LL criteria to interpret CMR, but we must use them with caution, given their limitations in ICI-M. For these reasons, some experts have recommended a wider use of the EMB. Nevertheless, we still lack evidence to adopt this invasive diagnostic strategy, especially in patients with few or no symptoms who would have a low pretest probability of an EMB. The value of repeat CMR is also not established. Finally, we do not know the true accuracy of these definitions, as none have been validated in clinical studies.

Both definitions require excluding another cause of myocardial injury, especially ACS by coronary imaging. In clinical practice, the situation is sometimes challenging when ICI-M and coronary artery disease are combined. Recent data also suggest that ICI therapy may lead to worsened atherosclerotic disease and ACS. Takotsubo-like syndromes have also been described, making diagnoses even more challenging.

Top 10 key takeaway points — presentations and biomarkers: Clinicians need to be aware of the 3 classic presentations of myocarditis: chest pain, heart failure (HF)/shock, and/or symptoms related to arrhythmia (eg, presyncope or syncope), and in a young person, the history of an antecedent viral infection, or other risk factors that define stage A at-risk for myocarditis, followed by any of these cardiovascular symptoms should raise the suspicion of this diagnosis. High-sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs-cTn) is a common diagnostic test in patients with suspected myocarditis; however, some patients with myocarditis will not have an elevated hs-cTn.

Discussion

ICIs are specific monoclonal antibodies directed against inhibitory proteins of the cellular immune system, thus enabling an amplified T-cell–mediated immune response against cancer cells. These drugs have shown remarkable results in treating advanced metastatic cancers including melanoma, non–small cell lung cancer, and renal cell carcinoma. However, unchecked activation of antitumor T cells can lead to off-target autoimmune damage involving host tissues, including acute myocarditis. Until recently, the incidence of ICI-induced myocarditis was underestimated and poorly characterized. Data regarding the diagnosis and management of ICI-induced myocarditis are mostly based on expert-opinion, yet this case of resolved ICI-induced myocarditis and cardiogenic shock highlights several important clinical aspects.

Given that myocarditis has a wide spectrum of clinical presentations and because the prognosis of patients with ICI-induced myocarditis in particular is very poor, we believe that both close surveillance and a high index of suspicion are needed to make a rapid, and possibly lifesaving, diagnosis of ICI-induced myocarditis.

Whom to follow? Combination therapy with different ICI agents is the best-established risk factor for ICI-induced myocarditis, and indeed our patient received both ipilimumab and nivolumab, which have been shown to confer a 5-fold increased risk for developing myocarditis compared with nivolumab alone. Moreover, although not evident in our patient, myositis is a common concomitant finding in patients with ICI-induced myocarditis (29% of cases), and therefore it should be regarded as a "red flag" to look for myocarditis in patients treated with ICIs. Several diagnostic algorithms have been published on how to screen these high-risk patients, but additional studies are needed to identify other patient- or cancer-related risk factors.

When to screen? In a large case series, the median time from the first dose of ICI to the onset of myocarditis was 34 days (interquartile range: 21 to 75 days), and only 1 or 2 ICI doses have preceded the onset of myocarditis in the majority (93%) of fatal cases. However, other investigators have shown an increased risk of ICI-induced myocarditis within the first 3 months of treatment, as was evident in our case.

### Diagnosis and management of myocarditis: an evidence-based review for the emergency medicine clinician [^113XT5DB]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Myocarditis is a potentially fatal condition that can be misdiagnosed in the emergency department (ED) setting.

Objective

The purpose of this narrative review article is to provide a summary of the background, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management of myocarditis, with a focus on emergency clinicians.

Discussion

Myocarditis occurs when inflammation of the heart musculature causes cardiac dysfunction. Symptoms may range from mild to severe and are often preceded by a viral prodrome. Laboratory assessment and an electrocardiogram can be helpful for the diagnosis, but echocardiography is the ideal test in the ED setting. Some patients may also require advanced imaging, though this will often occur during hospitalization or follow-up. Treatment is primarily focused on respiratory and hemodynamic support. Initial hemodynamic management includes vasopressors and inotropes, whereas more severe cases may require an intra-aortic balloon pump, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, or a ventricular assist device. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs should be avoided while intravenous immunoglobulin is controversial.

Conclusion

Myocarditis is a serious condition with the potential for significant morbidity and mortality. It is important for clinicians to be aware of the current evidence regarding the diagnosis, management, and disposition of these patients.

### Epidemiology of myocarditis following COVID-19 or influenza and use of diagnostic assessments [^1155xzTk]. Open Heart (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Previous research has suggested a heightened risk of acute myocarditis after COVID-19 infection. However, it is not clear from existing work whether this risk is higher than would be expected after comparable viral respiratory infections. This information is important to guide risk assessments and clinical practice.

Methods

A retrospective cohort study of US administrative health claims was conducted to compare the rates of myocarditis after COVID-19 with that after influenza infection and describe the clinical use of diagnostic assessments. Patients with either incident COVID-19 diagnosis (between 1 January 2020 and 31 December 2021) or incident influenza diagnosis (between 1 January 2016 and 31 December 2018), with at least 12 months of continuous enrolment prior to index date and without a previous diagnosis of myocarditis were included. The primary outcome was clinically diagnosed acute myocarditis recorded after COVID-19 or influenza infection. Results are reported as covariate-adjusted subdistribution HRs from competing risk regression with COVID-19 considered as the exposure of interest and influenza as the reference group. Death was considered a competing risk.

Results

1120760 adult COVID-19 patients and 439278 adult influenza patients were identified, of which 669 (0.06%) adult COVID-19 patients and 91 (0.02%) adult influenza patients received a diagnosis of myocarditis. The myocarditis rate per 1000 person-years was 0.73 (95% CI 0.67 to 0.78) for adult COVID-19 patients and 0.24 (95% CI 0.19 to 0.28) for adult influenza populations. In models comprehensively adjusted for demographic and clinical risk factors, COVID-19 diagnosis (compared with influenza diagnosis), cardiac comorbidities, being male and under the age of 30 were independently associated with an increased risk of myocarditis in the year after diagnosis.

Conclusions

These findings support a distinct link between COVID-19 and myocarditis, which appears greater than after a similar viral respiratory infection. As such, a greater degree of clinical suspicion and investigation according to existing diagnostic pathways is recommended.

### Diagnostic approach for suspected acute myocarditis: considerations for standardization and broadening clinical spectrum [^115UZgJi]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

Myocarditis is a heterogeneous disease in terms of disease severity and manifestation. As many patients with suspected myocarditis will present in different subspecialties of cardiology, well organized myocarditis care pathways spanning beyond the boundaries of subspecialty cardiology disciplines are advisable. Using a 3‐tier diagnostic approach allows for the structured evaluation of the patients with suspected myocarditis allowing to titrate the diagnostic and therapeutic process to the patients' individualized needs. Such a structured tier approach can easily be supplemented by emerging advances in the future, such as immune phenotyping that could potentially shape the diagnosis, classification, and therapeutic basis of myocarditis.

Cardiomyopathy

Cardiomyopathies and acute myocarditis were a higher-ranked cause of CVD DALYs in the regions of Central and Eastern Europe than in other world regions. There were an estimated 2.54 million (95% UI: 2.41 to 2.66 million) prevalent cases of cardiomyopathy and myocarditis in 2015. There was a slightly higher prevalence among children 1 to 4 years of age (29 per 100,000; 95% UI: 26 to 32 per 100,000), which then decreased for older children, increasing slowly throughout adulthood. A very large increase in cases of cardiomyopathy and acute myocarditis was estimated above 80 years of age (628 per 100,000; 95% UI: 569 to 692 per 100,000), more than 6-fold higher than for the next youngest age group of 75 to 79 years of age. This condition accounted for a relatively small proportion of CVD cases overall, with the greatest age-standardized prevalence estimated for Southern sub-Saharan Africa, followed by tropical Latin America, high-income North America, and other regions of sub-Saharan Africa.

There were 353,700 (95% UI: 339,500 to 370,600) deaths due to cardiomyopathy and myocarditis in 2015. The mortality rate was as high as 47 per 100,000 persons (95% UI: 33 to 59 per 100,000) within the first week of life. The mortality rate decreased by 5 years of age, and then increased steadily throughout adulthood before increasing more than 300% after 80 years of age, to a peak rate of 90 per 100,000 (95% UI: 85 to 94 per 100,000). CVD deaths due to cardiomyopathy and myocarditis were most common in regions with high prevalence, including Southern sub-Saharan Africa and tropical Latin America.

### Understanding myocarditis: from an early sketch toward a more complete picture [^115sn6jw]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Sex- and age-based differences are integral to the improved understanding of myocarditis, but the research and clinical teams also need to delve into other influencing factors. In addition to genetic factors and predisposition, variables such as individual molecular profiles, comorbid conditions, environmental exposures and risks, and social determinants of health all impact disease presentation.

More in-depth work examining the presentation and outcomes in patients of diverse ethnic and racial backgrounds is likely forthcoming. These studies must also carefully assess whether some of the ethnic and racial differences are biologic or more related to issues of access to care and other social determinants of health or perhaps under-representation in hospitalizations, research studies, and registries. Ethnic and racial differences in outcomes in heart failure have already been identified, as Black patients have higher incidence of dilated cardiomyopathy and increased mortality. Pediatric patients with myocarditis who are from racial and ethnic minorities have higher rates of mortality.

Additional studies need to include an analysis of transgender patients who take hormonal replacements and may have different risks for myocarditis. There are limited data examining the use of gender-affirming hormone therapy and cardiovascular risk.

The role of EMB should be re-examined. While advanced imaging has helped to obviate the need for EMB in the general clinical diagnosis of acute myocarditis, the role of tissue-level characterization and studies remains important, and there may be areas of high complementarity between CMR and EMB. Poor biopsy yield related to poor sampling might be improved upon by using imaging to help guide EMB location. Improved sampling may then yield more informative histological diagnoses and expand viral genomic and proteomic understanding of myocarditis.

There have been recent efforts to comprehensively phenotype patients with heart failure and cardiomyopathy. One might consider myocarditis to represent an early stage in the spectrum of cardiomyopathy and possibly heart failure. While detailed phenotyping of myocarditis requires additional work, clearer understanding of the fundamental pathophysiological mechanisms and susceptibilities that are derived may direct more individualized therapies. With enough components, modular data, artificial intelligence, and machine learning algorithms may then ultimately be able to provide improved risk assessments.

### Recognition and initial management of fulminant myocarditis: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^115vQRwz]. Circulation (2020). Medium credibility.

Fulminant myocarditis (FM) is an uncommon syndrome characterized by sudden and severe diffuse cardiac inflammation often leading to death resulting from cardiogenic shock, ventricular arrhythmias, or multiorgan system failure. Historically, FM was almost exclusively diagnosed at autopsy. By definition, all patients with FM will need some form of inotropic or mechanical circulatory support to maintain end-organ perfusion until transplantation or recovery. Specific subtypes of FM may respond to immunomodulatory therapy in addition to guideline-directed medical care. Despite the increasing availability of circulatory support, orthotopic heart transplantation, and disease-specific treatments, patients with FM experience significant morbidity and mortality as a result of a delay in diagnosis and initiation of circulatory support and lack of appropriately trained specialists to manage the condition. This scientific statement outlines the resources necessary to manage the spectrum of FM, including extracorporeal life support, percutaneous and durable ventricular assist devices, transplantation capabilities, and specialists in advanced heart failure, cardiothoracic surgery, cardiac pathology, immunology, and infectious disease. Education of frontline providers who are most likely to encounter FM first is essential to increase timely access to appropriately resourced facilities, to prevent multiorgan system failure, and to tailor disease-specific therapy as early as possible in the disease process.

### Occurrence and features of childhood myocarditis: a nationwide study in Finland [^111AZR5y]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Figure 3
Incidence of myocarditis in a general pediatric population. Total (A) and sex‐specific (B) incidence rates (per 100 000 person‐years) by age.

Sex difference in incidence rate, however, was significantly age‐dependent (interaction P < 0.0001; Figure 3 B). Few cases of myocarditis occurred during the first year of life among boys (incidence rate: 1.8/100 000 person‐years). No myocarditis admissions occurred in the male population aged 1 to 3 years, but the incidence rate increased exponentially thereafter, with the peak in 15‐year‐old adolescent boys (incidence rate: 18.1/100 000 person‐years; Figure 3 B). Incidence rate pattern was more stable among girls, with the rate of myocarditis having a less steeply increasing trend in adolescence (Figure 3 B).

There was no sex difference in the incidence rate of myocarditis in children aged 0 to 5 years, but boys aged 6 to 10 years were significantly more likely to acquire myocarditis than girls (incidence rate ratio: 2.46; 95% CI, 1.03–5.89; P = 0.043). Sex difference increased further in children and adolescents aged 11 to 15 years (incidence rate ratio: 3.89; 95% CI, 2.68–5.67; P < 0.0001).

Adverse Outcomes

The in‐hospital mortality rate of myocarditis admission was 1.4% (n = 3), and 1 patient (0.5%) received an urgent cardiac transplant. Three patients (1.4%) were treated with ventricular assist devices. Altogether, 13 patients (6.1%) were treated in intensive care units. Mortality among patients treated with intensive care and ventricular assist devices were 15.4% and 66.7%, respectively. No sex‐ or age‐related differences in outcomes or usage of ventricular assist device or intensive care treatments were noted, although small numbers precluded any statistical analyses.

Top 10 key takeaway points — staging and referral: A novel 4-stage classification of myocarditis is proposed, with stage A referring to those having or exposed to risk factors, stage B to those asymptomatic but with evidence of myocardial inflammation, stage C to those with symptomatic myocarditis, and stage D to those with advanced myocarditis (hemodynamic or electrical instability requiring intervention). Risk stratification in patients with symptomatic myocarditis guides the decision whether to refer to an advanced HF center with a multidisciplinary myocarditis team, and there should be a low threshold to transfer patients with high-risk features, such as severely reduced ventricular function, symptomatic HF, hemodynamic instability, or electrical instability (either ventricular arrhythmias or heart block).

Statistical analysis

Categorical variables were summarized as counts and percentages and compared using Fisher exact or chi-square tests. Continuous variables were summarized as mean ± SD or median (IQR) for normally and non-normally distributed data, respectively. Continuous data were compared using unpaired t tests or Mann-Whitney U tests dependent on normality. We calculated the cumulative incidence of myocarditis as the number of myocarditis cases per the total number of patients who received ICIs between 2014 and 2021. The overall incidence rate of myocarditis (cases per 10,000 person-years) and 95% CI was calculated with follow-up time beginning at the start of ICI therapy. We additionally calculated the yearly incidence of myocarditis. To identify risk factors for myocarditis, we compared demographic and clinical variables between patients with and without myocarditis using standard summary statistics, as myocarditis often occurs shortly after beginning ICI treatment, with the vast majority of patients developing myocarditis within 60 days. Although the competing risk of death was unlikely given the short timeline of development of myocarditis, we also examined the association between clinical characteristics and incident myocarditis using univariable Cox proportional hazards models as a sensitivity analysis to estimate HRs and 95% CIs.

### Management of acute myocarditis and chronic inflammatory cardiomyopathy: an expert consensus document [^112ZiMVT]. Circulation: Heart Failure (2020). Medium credibility.

Myocarditis is an inflammatory disease of the heart that may occur because of infections, immune system activation, or exposure to drugs. The diagnosis of myocarditis has changed due to the introduction of cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. We present an expert consensus document aimed to summarize the common terminology related to myocarditis meanwhile highlighting some areas of controversies and uncertainties and the unmet clinical needs. In fact, controversies persist regarding mechanisms that determine the transition from the initial trigger to myocardial inflammation and from acute myocardial damage to chronic ventricular dysfunction. It is still uncertain which viruses (besides enteroviruses) cause direct tissue damage, act as triggers for immune-mediated damage, or both. Regarding terminology, myocarditis can be characterized according to etiology, phase, and severity of the disease, predominant symptoms, and pathological findings. Clinically, acute myocarditis (AM) implies a short time elapsed from the onset of symptoms and diagnosis (generally < 1 month). In contrast, chronic inflammatory cardiomyopathy indicates myocardial inflammation with established dilated cardiomyopathy or hypokinetic nondilated phenotype, which in the advanced stages evolves into fibrosis without detectable inflammation. Suggested diagnostic and treatment recommendations for AM and chronic inflammatory cardiomyopathy are mainly based on expert opinion given the lack of well-designed contemporary clinical studies in the field. We will provide a shared and practical approach to patient diagnosis and management, underlying differences between the European and US scientific statements on this topic. We explain the role of histology that defines subtypes of myocarditis and its prognostic and therapeutic implications.

### Arrhythmias in myocarditis: state of the art [^112rQDer]. Heart Rhythm (2019). Medium credibility.

Many kinds of arrhythmias may occur in patients with myocarditis at any stage of the disease. However, compared to the other clinical presentations, arrhythmic myocarditis has been poorly described in the literature. Arrhythmias occurring in either ongoing or previous myocardial inflammation are complex and heterogeneous, and the disease itself is often underdiagnosed, thus limiting data collection and interpretation. However, different from the other clinical presentations, arrhythmic myocarditis requires specific diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic considerations. The aim of this review is to critically summarize the state of the art on myocarditis presenting with arrhythmias in terms of epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment.

### Approximation of the incidence of myocarditis by systematic screening With cardiac magnetic resonance imaging [^114bPg7L]. JACC: Heart Failure (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

This study sought to obtain an approximation of the true incidence of myocarditis by systematic screening of patients at risk using cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) in a tertiary care center.

Background

Underdiagnosis of myocarditis and resulting uncertainty about its incidence remain a clinical dilemma. The authors hypothesized that systematic screening of patients presenting with angina-like symptoms, elevated troponin T, and no significant coronary artery disease using CMR will provide an approximation of the true incidence of myocarditis.

Methods

The authors performed a retrospective chart review of patients presenting with angina-like symptoms and elevated high-sensitivity troponin T (TnT-hs ≥ 14 ng/l) in 2015 and 2016. During the year 2015, only patients with elevated TnT-hs, no significant coronary artery disease, and moderate-to-high clinical likelihood of myocarditis underwent CMR. Starting in 2016, CMR was obtained in patients with similar presentation, but independent of clinical likelihood of myocarditis.

Results

A total of 1,788 patients (74% male, age 69 ± 14 years) qualified for our analysis. In 2015, 521 patients presented with angina-like symptoms and TnT-hs elevation. In 2016, the number increased to 1,267 patients. Although in the year 2015, a total of 4 of 88 (5%) CMRs were positive for myocarditis, the percentage of positive CMRs doubled (26 of 199; 13%; p = 0.03) in 2016.

Conclusions

A novel diagnostic screening algorithm led to a 6.3-fold increase of the incidence of myocarditis in our hospital. Furthermore, the percentage of CMRs positive for myocarditis doubled, supporting the diagnostic value of this method. Considering the potentially lethal adverse events of myocarditis if left untreated, we recommend a low threshold for the use of CMR in patients with angina-like symptoms and elevated TnT-hs after exclusion of coronary artery disease.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for myocarditis, more specifically with respect to clinical and imaging follow-up, ESC 2025 guidelines recommend to obtain follow-up with clinical assessment, biomarkers, ECG, exercise test, Holter-ECG monitoring, echocardiography, and cardiac MRI at least within 6 months after the index hospitalization in all patients with myocarditis to identify potential progression or new risk factors.

### Myocarditis in patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors [^115ZpyPb]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Myocarditis is an uncommon, but potentially fatal, toxicity of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI). Myocarditis after ICI has not been well characterized.

Objectives

The authors sought to understand the presentation and clinical course of ICI-associated myocarditis.

Methods

After observation of sporadic ICI-associated myocarditis cases, the authors created a multicenter registry with 8 sites. From November 2013 to July 2017, there were 35 patients with ICI-associated myocarditis, who were compared to a random sample of 105 ICI-treated patients without myocarditis. Covariates of interest were extracted from medical records including the occurrence of major adverse cardiac events (MACE), defined as the composite of cardiovascular death, cardiogenic shock, cardiac arrest, and hemodynamically significant complete heart block.

Results

The prevalence of myocarditis was 1.14% with a median time of onset of 34 days after starting ICI (interquartile range: 21 to 75 days). Cases were 65 ± 13 years of age, 29% were female, and 54% had no other immune-related side effects. Relative to controls, combination ICI (34% vs. 2%; p < 0.001) and diabetes (34% vs. 13%; p = 0.01) were more common in cases. Over 102 days (interquartile range: 62 to 214 days) of median follow-up, 16 (46%) developed MACE; 38% of MACE occurred with normal ejection fraction. There was a 4-fold increased risk of MACE with troponin T of ≥ 1.5 ng/ml (hazard ratio: 4.0; 95% confidence interval: 1.5 to 10.9; p = 0.003). Steroids were administered in 89%, and lower steroids doses were associated with higher residual troponin and higher MACE rates.

Conclusions

Myocarditis after ICI therapy may be more common than appreciated, occurs early after starting treatment, has a malignant course, and responds to higher steroid doses.

### Myocarditis after COVID-19 and influenza infections: insights from a large data set [^117GHxAm]. Open Heart (2024). Medium credibility.

Another observation in the current study is the low overall rate of vaccination in the general population both against influenza and SARS-CoV-2 (3.3%). For the latter, the finding may be explained by the study's inclusion period, as newly developed vaccines against COVID-19 first became widely available in late 2020 and early 2021. This may have been a strategic decision made by the authors when designing the study aiming to reduce the effect of potentially confounding elements. While a detailed discussion is beyond the scope of this editorial, it is critical to highlight that, beyond the viral infection itself, an increased incidence of myocarditis has also been reported after receiving COVID-19 messenger RNA vaccination, particularly in young males and the elderly. While the exact incidence has been widely debated, it is ultimately believed to represent a rare event, even when compared directly against postviral aetiologies. Based on a retrospective claims-based database analysis, it would essentially be impossible to accurately identify and isolate these cases. Vaccination became virtually universal in 2021, which has likely reduced the risk of serious complications, including acute post-COVID-19 myocarditis. In a future study, the authors may consider extending their analysis to assess the potential change in rates of postviral myocarditis before and after 2022 as a result of vaccination.

### Management of myocarditis-related cardiomyopathy in adults [^115c5QeF]. Circulation Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Myocarditis is generally a mild and self-limited consequence of systemic infection of cardiotropic viruses. However, patients can develop a temporary or permanent impairment of cardiac function including acute cardiomyopathy with hemodynamic compromise or severe arrhythmias. In this setting, specific causes of inflammation are associated with variable risks of death and transplantation. Recent translational studies suggest that treatments tailored to specific causes of myocarditis may impact clinical outcomes when added to guideline-directed medical care. This review summarizes recent advances in translational research that influence the utility of endomyocardial biopsy for the management of inflammatory cardiomyopathies. Emerging therapies for myocarditis based on these mechanistic hypotheses are entering clinical trials and may add to the benefits of established heart failure treatment.

### Epidemiology of myocarditis following COVID-19 or influenza and use of diagnostic assessments [^115xutNQ]. Open Heart (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Myocarditis is an inflammatory process of the myocardium, and the most common cause is a viral infection such as influenza or coronaviruses. While most cases of viral myocarditis are mild with good prognosis, life-threatening cardiac dysfunction and arrhythmias may occur. Myocarditis can result in heart failure and sudden cardiac death and has been recognised as a rare complication of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection, the strain of coronavirus that causes COVID-19. A large international study reported acute myocarditis in 2.4–4.1 out of 1000 patients hospitalised with COVID-19 and demonstrated greater haemodynamic instability in these patients. Myocardial injury with diffuse oedema has been identified even in COVID-19 patients with mild or asymptomatic infection. The clinical significance of these findings is unclear. While existing literature suggests association of COVID-19 exposure with an increased risk of myocarditis, it is not known whether the increased risk of myocarditis linked to COVID-19 is greater than that expected after exposure to other common viral respiratory infections and if demographic factors differ between patients with myocarditis following COVID-19 compared with other viral infections.

Accurate diagnosis of COVID-19-related myocarditis is essential for tailoring treatment strategies and mitigating the associated morbidity and mortality. Cardiovascular MR (CMR) is the primary diagnostic tool for non-invasive assessment of myocardial inflammation in patients with known or suspected cardiomyopathy and myocarditisincluding inflammatory cardiomyopathy due to COVID-19, where contrast enhancement protocols (ie, late gadolinium enhancement) are essential in the diagnosis, risk stratification and prognosis. The Society for Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance, the European Society of Cardiology and the American College of Cardiology collectively affirm that CMR is a potentially valuable diagnostic tool in patients with COVID-19 presenting with myocardial injury and evidence of cardiac dysfunction. However, no contrast agent is approved in the United States for use in the assessment of inflammatory cardiomyopathy in patients with active or convalescent COVID-19.

The objective of the study was to assess the rates of incident myocarditis in patients diagnosed with COVID-19 against patients diagnosed with influenza, while accounting for potential confounders, and to describe the diagnostic assessments surrounding myocarditis events including CMR and contrast agents, among a very large cohort of patients drawn from a US administrative claims database.

### Myocarditis associated with COVID-19 vaccination [^111gVBMK]. NPJ Vaccines (2024). Medium credibility.

Risk to develop myocarditis: COVID-19-vaccination vs COVID-19-infection

Before COVID vaccines were deployed and administered, it was reported that patients with COVID-19 have approximatively 16 times the risk for myocarditis relative to patients without COVID-19. Matched analyses from medical records (Dec 2020 to May 2021) from the largest health care organization in Israelshowed that COVID-19 vaccination was associated with an elevated risk of myocarditis (risk ratio, 3.24) compared to unvaccinated and SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with a substantially increased risk of myocarditis (risk ratio, 18.28) compared to uninfected. It was also noted that a significant lower mortality rate was observed among individuals with myocarditis after mRNA vaccination when compared to those with a viral infection–related myocarditis. In line with these results, a more recent study showed that the relative risk of heart failure within 90 days was 0.56 and 1.48 for myocarditis associated with vaccination and COVID-19 disease, respectively. In summary, compared with myocarditis associated with COVID-19 disease, myocarditis after vaccination with SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines occurs less frequent and in addition is associated with a better clinical outcome. However, the accurate background incidence rate in healthy people and the actual number of vaccine associated cases are overall difficult to determine, and are most likely under-estimated, as many cases resolve without an actual diagnosis or assistance by healthcare providers and estimating the extent of potential under-reporting in the pharmacovigilance systems still remains a challenge as it may be influenced by numerous factors, including public awareness, the disease severity spectrum, demographics, and/or local practices.

### Association between COVID-19 and myocarditis… [^112VnV4u]. CDC (2022). Medium credibility.

What are the implications for public health practice. These findings underscore the importance of implementing evidence-based COVID-19 prevention strategies, including vaccination, to reduce the public health impact of COVID-19 and its associated complications. Altmetric: Citations: During 2020, the number of myocarditis inpatient encounters was 42. 3% higher than that during
2019. Peaks in myocarditis inpatient encounters during April–May 2020 and November 2020–January 2021 generally aligned with peaks in COVID-19 inpatient encounters. Within the cohort of 36, 005, 294 patients, 1, 452, 773 received a diagnosis of COVID-19 during March 2020–January 2021, and 5, 069 received a diagnosis of myocarditis during March 2020–February 2021. Among patients with myocarditis, 2, 116 had a history of COVID-19; this percentage was similar among males and females and differed by age group, with the lowest percentages among persons aged 16–24 years and 25–39 years and the highest among adults aged ≥ 75 years. During March 2020–January 2021, the risk for myocarditis was 0. 146% among patients with COVID-19 and
0. 009% among patients without COVID-19. Among patients with COVID-19, the risk for myocarditis was higher among males than among females and was highest among adults aged ≥ 75 years, 65–74 years, and 50–64 years and among children aged < 16 years. Discussion In this study, the occurrence of myocarditis inpatient encounters was 42% higher in 2020 than in 2019. The risk for myocarditis among patients with COVID-19 during March 2020–January 2021 was nearly 16 times as high as the risk among patients without COVID-19, with the association between COVID-19 and myocarditis being most pronounced among children and older adults.

Further, in this cohort, approximately 40% of patients with myocarditis had a history of COVID-19.

### Cardiac complications after SARS-CoV-2 infection and mRNA… [^114V5oCa]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

This study used EHR data from 40 health care systems* participating in PCORnet, the National Patient-Centered Clinical Research Network. Among males aged 12–17 years, the incidences of myocarditis and myocarditis or pericarditis were 50. 1–64. 9 cases per 100, 000 after infection,
2. 2–3. 3 after the first vaccine dose, and
22. 0–35. 9 after the second dose; incidences of myocarditis, pericarditis, or MIS were
150. 5–180. 0 after infection. Among males aged 18–29 years, the incidences of myocarditis and myocarditis or pericarditis were 55.

3–100. 6 cases per 100, 000 after infection,
0. 9–8. 1 after the first vaccine dose, and
6. 5–15. 0 after the second dose; incidences of myocarditis, pericarditis, or MIS were
97. 2–140. 8 after infection. Among males aged ≥ 30 years, the incidences of myocarditis and myocarditis or pericarditis were 57. 2–114. 0 cases per 100, 000 after infection,
0. 9–7. 3 after the first vaccine dose, and
0. 5–7. 3 after the second dose; incidences of myocarditis, pericarditis, or MIS were
109. 1–136. 8 after infection. Among females aged 5–11 years, incidences of myocarditis and myocarditis or pericarditis were 5. 4–10. 8 cases per 100, 000 after infection, and incidences of myocarditis, pericarditis, or MIS were
67. 3–94. 2 after infection.

### Patient information: acute myocarditis… [^116Pk5X8]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

Walter K. What Is Acute Myocarditis. JAMA. 2023; 330:

574. doi: 10.1001/jama.2023.5526 Acute myocarditis is inflammation of the heart muscle. Acute myocarditis may cause chest pain, shortness of breath, heart pounding, and, rarely, fainting. Many patients report flu-like symptoms before onset of acute myocarditis. The most common cause of acute myocarditis is a viral infection. Acute myocarditis is also associated with some autoimmune diseases, certain drugs, and some vaccines. However, the risk of myocarditis is substantially higher after infection with SARS-CoV-2 than after mRNA COVID-19 vaccination, and the rate of acute myocarditis after SARS-CoV-2 infection is lower among individuals who have received an mRNA COVID-19 vaccination.

Acute myocarditis affects 4 to 14 per 100 000 individuals per year and is more common in males than females. It often occurs between ages 30 and 45 years, although children, teens, and older individuals may also be affected. Acute myocarditis does not cause serious health effects in most people. However, about 25% of patients have decreased cardiac strength, heart rhythm abnormalities, or acute heart failure. Between 3% and 9% develop cardiogenic shock, a life-threatening condition in which the heart is not able to adequately pump blood to vital organs in the body. Approximately 1% to 7% of patients die of acute myocarditis. Patients with acute myocarditis typically have elevated blood levels of troponin, a protein that is normally found only in the heart, and increased blood markers of inflammation. Electrocardiography may show abnormal electrical activity of the heart, and echocardiography may reveal decreased heart function.

Diagnosis can be confirmed with either cardiac magnetic resonance imaging or biopsy of the heart. Treatment depends on the cause and severity of acute myocarditis. Patients with acute myocarditis due to an autoimmune disease are typically treated with steroids and sometimes receive additional immunosuppressive medications. People taking medications that may cause acute myocarditis should stop these drugs.

### Diagnosis and treatment of acute myocarditis – A review… [^117Xemqm]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

Importance Acute myocarditis, defined as a sudden inflammatory injury to the myocardium, affects approximately 4 to 14 people per 100 000 each year globally and is associated with a mortality rate of approximately 1% to 7%. Observations. The most common causes of myocarditis are viruses, such as influenza and coronavirus; systemic autoimmune disorders, such as systemic lupus erythematosus; drugs, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors; and vaccines, including smallpox and mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. Approximately 82% to 95% of adult patients with acute myocarditis present with chest pain, while 19% to 49% present with dyspnea, and 5% to 7% with syncope. The diagnosis of myocarditis can be suggested by presenting symptoms, elevated biomarkers such as troponins, electrocardiographic changes of ST segments, and echocardiographic wall motion abnormalities or wall thickening. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging or endomyocardial biopsy are required for definitive diagnosis.

Treatment depends on acuity, severity, clinical presentation, and etiology. Approximately 75% of patients admitted with myocarditis have an uncomplicated course, with a mortality rate of approximately 0%. In contrast, acute myocarditis that is complicated by acute heart failure or ventricular arrhythmias is associated with a 12% rate of either in-hospital mortality or need for heart transplant. Approximately 2% to 9% of patients have hemodynamic instability, characterized by inability to maintain adequate end-organ perfusion, and require inotropic agents, or mechanical circulatory devices, such as extracorporeal life support, to facilitate functional recovery. These patients have an approximately 28% rate of mortality or heart transplant at 60 days. Immunosuppression is appropriate for patients who have myocarditis characterized by eosinophilic or giant cell myocardial infiltrations or due to systemic autoimmune disorders.

However, the specific immune cells that should be targeted to improve outcomes in patients with myocarditis remain unclear. Conclusions and Relevance Acute myocarditis affects approximately 4 to 14 per 100 000 people per year. First-line therapy depends on acuity, severity, clinical presentation, and etiology and includes supportive care. While corticosteroids are often used for specific forms of myocarditis, this practice is based on anecdotal evidence, and randomized clinical trials of optimal therapeutic interventions for acute myocarditis are needed.

### Prevalence of clinical and subclinical myocarditis in competitive athletes with recent SARS-CoV-2 infection… [^1151eKwn]. JAMA Network (2021). Excellent credibility.

The reported number of athlethes diagnosed with myocarditis, complete cardiac evaluations including CMR imaging, and the percent myocarditis with the 95% CI for each participating university and the overall prevalence. C, Duration between COVID-19 diagnosis and CMR imaging for athletes who were diagnosed with myocarditis. Data are displayed for participating institution where cases of myocarditis were observed. Findings In this cohort study of 1597 US competitive collegiate athletes undergoing comprehensive cardiovascular testing, the prevalence of clinical myocarditis based on a symptom-based screening strategy was only 0. 31%. Screening with cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging increased the prevalence of clinical and subclinical myocarditis by a factor of 7. 4 to
2. 3%.

Conclusions and Relevance In this cohort study of 1597 US competitive athletes with CMR screening after COVID-19 infection, 37 athletes were diagnosed with clinical and subclinical myocarditis. Variability was observed in prevalence across universities, and testing protocols were closely tied to the detection of myocarditis. Variable ascertainment and unknown implications of CMR findings underscore the need for standardized timing and interpretation of cardiac testing. SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19, has infected millions of people around the world, causing significant morbidity and mortality. 1 Competitive athletes are a unique population that may be at high risk for environmental and situational transmission of disease, and once infected, may be at risk for sudden cardiac death during training and competition. 2–6 Viral myocarditis in asymptomatic people is a common cause of SCD, especially among those younger than 35 years.

7–10 The incidence of SCD in collegiate athletes has been estimated at 1: 50 000 per year. Of those who had CMR imaging results, 37 athletes were diagnosed with either clinical or subclinical myocarditis. In the subgroup analysis including schools where CMR imaging was performed in all cardiac evaluations, from 919 cardiac evaluations, 21 athletes were diagnosed with myocarditis, resulting in a prevalence of 2. 3%, consistent with the overall observed prevalence.
