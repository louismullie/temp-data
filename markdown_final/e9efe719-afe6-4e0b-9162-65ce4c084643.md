## Question

Can ivermectin be used to treat Lyme disease?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether ivermectin can be used to treat Lyme disease. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the causative organism and standard-of-care treatments for Lyme disease. Then, I should verify what major guidelines recommend and whether any mention ivermectin. Next, I will review ivermectin's pharmacology and approved indications to assess biological plausibility. After that, I need to check the provided literature for any clinical evidence of ivermectin in Lyme disease or tick-bite management. Finally, I should consider safety and off-label use concerns and synthesize a clear clinical recommendation based on the totality of evidence [^117FSeWi] [^1141rvia] [^114Nb3Gc].

> Let me first confirm the basics: Lyme disease is caused by Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato spirochetes transmitted by Ixodes ticks, which implies a bacterial infection where antibiotics are the therapeutic cornerstone rather than antiparasitics, and early, appropriate antibiotic therapy is typically effective [^114KtSDv] [^114EfCjr].

> Next, I should review authoritative guidance to anchor the standard of care. The IDSA/AAN/ACR guidelines recommend oral doxycycline, amoxicillin, or cefuroxime for early localized disease; intravenous ceftriaxone (or cefotaxime or penicillin G) or high‑dose oral doxycycline for neurologic involvement depending on site; intravenous then oral therapy for carditis with a total 14–21 day course; and 28 days of oral agents for Lyme arthritis with intravenous ceftriaxone reserved for refractory cases, and I should double-check whether ivermectin appears anywhere in these recommendations — wait, it does not appear at all for any stage or manifestation of Lyme disease [^1155FMbK] [^115c5JQY] [^113y51qW] [^117PJZaP] [^117FSeWi].

> I will now examine ivermectin's pharmacology and labeled uses to assess plausibility. Ivermectin is a macrocyclic lactone antiparasitic that targets glutamate‑gated chloride channels in invertebrates; it is approved for onchocerciasis and strongyloidiasis (typically 150–200 µg/kg orally in one or two doses) and for topical use in rosacea, and hold on, I should verify whether there is any antibacterial activity — there is no established antibacterial activity against Borrelia or other bacteria, which undermines a mechanistic rationale for treating a spirochetal infection with this agent [^113N4kUS] [^115gnKwF] [^114Nb3Gc] [^112uPkUg].

> I need to check the provided literature set for any signal that ivermectin has been studied for Lyme disease. The review of unorthodox alternative therapies marketed for Lyme disease catalogs numerous non‑antimicrobial modalities but does not even list ivermectin, and I should note that within the provided references there are no clinical trials, case series, or guideline endorsements evaluating ivermectin for Borrelia infection, which suggests a lack of evidence base here [^113d8AGL].

> But wait, what about tick-bite management or prophylaxis — could ivermectin have a role there? The Wilderness Medical Society guidelines explicitly recommend against administering local or systemic medications, including systemic ivermectin, for tick removal or extermination, and for high‑risk Ixodes bites the recommended prophylaxis is a single dose of doxycycline within 72 hours of tick removal, not ivermectin, so I should be clear that guidelines actively discourage ivermectin use in this context [^113Bnpkh] [^113LR2HP].

> I should confirm safety considerations before closing the loop. When used for approved parasitic indications, ivermectin is generally well tolerated, but adverse effects can include gastrointestinal symptoms, rash, neurotoxicity, and liver injury, particularly with high or inappropriate dosing; importantly, extensive off‑label use in COVID‑19 has not shown clinical benefit in high‑quality randomized trials, underscoring the risk of exposing patients to harms without evidence of benefit — an analogy that cautions strongly against using ivermectin for a bacterial spirochetal infection like Lyme disease without supporting data [^114Nb3Gc] [^1121d97D] [^112YG4Ba].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about persistent symptoms either. For patients with post‑treatment Lyme disease symptoms, rigorous trials show no sustained benefit from prolonged or additional antibiotic therapy and guidelines recommend against further antibiotics in the absence of objective evidence of active infection, so I should emphasize that substituting ivermectin for evidence‑based management of residual symptoms is not supported and may add risk without benefit [^113B9N27] [^112niLTj] [^112KmheN].

> Synthesis and recommendation: Putting this together, ivermectin lacks a plausible antibacterial mechanism against Borrelia, is absent from all major Lyme disease guidelines, is specifically discouraged for tick removal, and has no clinical evidence in Lyme disease, whereas standard antibiotic regimens are well defined and effective; therefore, I need to be explicit that ivermectin should not be used to treat Lyme disease or for tick‑bite management, and patients should receive guideline‑concordant antibiotics and prevention strategies with follow‑up tailored to disease manifestation [^117FSeWi] [^1155FMbK] [^113Bnpkh].

Ivermectin is not recommended for Lyme disease because it has **no activity against Borrelia burgdorferi** [^113d8AGL] and is not included in any authoritative guidelines [^1169SKj1]. There is **no clinical evidence** supporting its use for Lyme disease, and standard antibiotics (doxycycline, amoxicillin, cefuroxime axetil, or IV ceftriaxone) remain the only proven treatments [^1155FMbK] [^117FSeWi]. Ivermectin should not be used for Lyme disease due to lack of efficacy and potential adverse effects.

---

## Mechanism of action of ivermectin

Ivermectin, a macrocyclic lactone, binds glutamate-gated chloride channels in invertebrates, causing parasite paralysis and death. It is active against nematodes and ectoparasites [^113N4kUS] but **has no activity against bacteria** such as Borrelia burgdorferi, the spirochete that causes Lyme disease [^113d8AGL].

---

## Current clinical guidelines for Lyme disease treatment

Authoritative IDSA/AAN/ACR guidelines recommend the following **evidence-based antibiotic regimens** for Lyme disease [^1169SKj1]:

| **Clinical manifestation** | **Recommended antibiotic therapy** |
|-|-|
| Erythema migrans (early Lyme disease) | - Doxycycline <br/> - Amoxicillin <br/> - Cefuroxime axetil [^1155FMbK] |
| Lyme arthritis | - Oral antibiotics (28 days) <br/> - IV ceftriaxone if severe or refractory [^117PJZaP] [^114VJGeV] |
| Lyme carditis | - IV ceftriaxone initially <br/> - Switch to oral antibiotics upon improvement [^113y51qW] [^113DqyTg] |
| Neurological Lyme disease | - IV ceftriaxone <br/> - Cefotaxime <br/> - Penicillin G <br/> - Oral doxycycline (selected cases) [^1141rvia] [^115c5JQY] |

---

These guidelines do not mention ivermectin, reflecting **no evidence of efficacy** against Borrelia burgdorferi [^1141cMHK].

---

## Evidence regarding ivermectin for Lyme disease

There is **no clinical evidence** supporting ivermectin for Lyme disease; no randomized controlled trials, observational studies, or case reports demonstrate efficacy against Borrelia burgdorferi or clinical benefit [^113d8AGL].

---

## Safety considerations and potential risks

Ivermectin is generally well tolerated at approved doses, but **adverse effects can occur**, especially with higher or prolonged dosing. Common adverse effects include **nausea, diarrhea, dizziness, pruritus, rash, and fatigue**, while serious adverse effects include **neurotoxicity (confusion, seizures, ataxia), hepatotoxicity, and severe hypersensitivity reactions** [^114Nb3Gc]. Using ivermectin for Lyme disease exposes patients to **unnecessary risks** without proven benefit [^1133KV9C].

---

## Regulatory and expert opinions

Regulatory agencies and expert panels **do not support the use of ivermectin** for Lyme disease [^1169SKj1]:

- **FDA**: No approval or endorsement for Lyme disease [^113N4kUS].
- **IDSA/AAN/ACR**: No mention or recommendation in guidelines [^1169SKj1].
- **CDC**: No recommendation for Lyme disease.

---

## Comparison with standard antibiotic therapies

Standard antibiotics are **highly effective** for Lyme disease, with success rates around 90% for early disease and substantial efficacy for later manifestations [^114KtSDv] [^116bvzsy]. In contrast, ivermectin has **no demonstrated efficacy** against Borrelia burgdorferi [^113d8AGL].

---

## Ongoing or planned clinical trials

There are **no registered trials** evaluating ivermectin for Lyme disease, underscoring the lack of scientific rationale or interest.

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Ivermectin is **not recommended** for Lyme disease due to a lack of evidence and potential harm [^1169SKj1]. Clinicians should use **guideline-supported antibiotics** and avoid unproven therapies [^116ZKcCF].

### Practice parameter: Treatment of nervous system Lyme disease (an evidence-based review): Report of the Quality Standards Subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology [RETIRED] [^1137dGci]. Neurology (2007). Low credibility.

To provide evidence-based recommendations on the treatment of nervous system Lyme disease and post-Lyme syndrome, three primary questions were addressed: Which antimicrobial agents are effective? Are different regimens preferred for different manifestations of nervous system Lyme disease? What duration of therapy is needed?

The authors analyzed published studies from 1983 to 2003 using a structured review process to classify the evidence related to these questions.

The panel reviewed 353 abstracts, which yielded 112 potentially relevant articles. From these, 37 articles were identified and included in the analysis.

There is sufficient data to conclude that, in both adults and children, this nervous system infection responds well to penicillin, ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, and doxycycline (Level B recommendation). Although most studies have used parenteral regimens for neuroborreliosis, several European studies support the use of oral doxycycline in adults with meningitis, cranial neuritis, and radiculitis (Level B). Parenteral regimens should be reserved for patients with parenchymal CNS involvement, other severe neurologic symptomatology, or failure to respond to oral regimens. The number of children aged 8 years or older enrolled in rigorous studies comparing oral versus parenteral regimens is smaller, which makes some conclusions less statistically compelling. However, all available data indicate results comparable to those observed in adults. In contrast, there is no compelling evidence that prolonged treatment with antibiotics is necessary.

### Prevalence and spectrum of residual symptoms in Lyme neuroborreliosis after pharmacological treatment: A systematic review [^1139RafT]. Journal of Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Controversy exists about residual symptoms after pharmacological treatment of Lyme neuroborreliosis. Reports of disabling long-term sequelae lead to concerns among patients and healthcare providers. We systematically reviewed the available evidence from studies reporting treatment of Lyme neuroborreliosis to assess the prevalence and spectrum of residual symptoms after treatment.

A literature search was performed in three databases and three clinical trial registers to find eligible studies reporting on residual symptoms in patients after pharmacological treatment of LNB. Diagnosis must have been performed according to consensus-derived case definitions. No restrictions regarding study design or language were set. Symptom prevalence was pooled using a random-effects model.

- **Eligible studies**: Forty-four clinical trials and studies were found: 8 RCTs, 17 cohort studies, 2 case-control studies, and 17 case series. The follow-up period in the eligible studies ranged from 7 days to 20 years. The weighted mean proportion of residual symptoms was 28% (95% CI 23–34%, n = 34 studies) for the latest reported time point. Prevalence of residual symptoms was statistically significantly higher in studies using the "possible" case definition (p = 0.0048).

- **Symptom differences**: Cranial neuropathy, pain, paresis, cognitive disturbances, headache, and fatigue were statistically significantly lower in studies using the "probable/definite" case definition.

LNB patients may experience residual symptoms after treatment, with a prevalence of approximately 28%. The prevalence and spectrum of residual symptoms differ according to case definitions used.

### Duration of antibiotic therapy for early Lyme disease. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^116bvzsy]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2003). High credibility.

Treatment of patients with early Lyme disease has trended toward longer duration despite the absence of supporting clinical trials.

- **Objective**: To evaluate different durations of oral doxycycline treatment and the combination of oral doxycycline and a single intravenous dose of ceftriaxone for treatment of patients with early Lyme disease.

- **Design**: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.

- **Setting**: Single-center university hospital.

- **Patients**: 180 patients with erythema migrans.

- **Intervention**: Ten days of oral doxycycline, with or without a single intravenous dose of ceftriaxone, or 20 days of oral doxycycline.

- **Measurements**: Outcome was based on clinical observations and neurocognitive testing. Efficacy was assessed at 20 days, 3 months, 12 months, and 30 months.

- **Results**: At all time points, the complete response rate was similar for the three treatment groups in both on-study and intention-to-treat analyses. In the on-study analysis, the complete response rate at 30 months was 83.9% in the 20-day doxycycline group, 90.3% in the 10-day doxycycline group, and 86.5% in the doxycycline-ceftriaxone group (P > 0.2). The only patient with treatment failure (10-day doxycycline group) developed meningitis on day 18. There were no significant differences in the results of neurocognitive testing among the three treatment groups and a separate control group without Lyme disease. Diarrhea occurred significantly more often in the doxycycline-ceftriaxone group (35%) than in either of the other two groups (P < 0.001).

### Treatment of post-treatment Lyme disease symptoms-a systematic review [^113jfF3c]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Low credibility.

One reviewer (RD) evaluated titles and abstracts to determine the eligibility of the studies regarding target population, intervention, study design, and publication type. Each reference included at this first stage was then further evaluated for eligibility at the full-text stage. Data were extracted by one reviewer (RD) from the full texts of included studies and entered into Review Manager (RevMan 5.4). Data extraction and data handling were performed in analogy to a previously published review protocol regarding the treatment of Lyme neuroborreliosis.

The assessment of risk of bias in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was performed independently by two reviewers (RD and GT) according to the Cochrane risk of bias tool to align with the methodology of a previous systematic review on Lyme neuroborreliosis. In the event of disagreement, consensus was achieved through discussion with all the review authors. As post-treatment Lyme disease (PTLD) symptoms represent a controversial topic, our systematic review relied on studies with adequate methodological rigor. Therefore, studies with a rating of high risk of bias in any item were not considered for further qualitative analysis. Patient-reported outcomes like quality of life and fatigue were of particular interest in this review. The assessment of these outcomes by the respective patients is inherently subjective. However, the item blinding of outcome assessment of patient-reported outcomes was regarded as having a low risk of bias when patients were adequately blinded regarding their specific interventions.

### Ivermectin for preventing and treating COVID-19 [^114Nb3Gc]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Low credibility.

In animals and humans, ivermectin is easily absorbed by the mucosa if taken orally or by the skin if used topically. As a lipophilic compound, it accumulates in fat and liver tissue from where it effuses and takes effect. Elimination is processed through bile and feces. Ivermectin is widely used in veterinary medicine and is an essential drug for treating human parasitic diseases, such as onchocerciasis, lymphatic filariasis, strongyloidiasis, and scabies globally. The established dosing regimen ranges from 150 µg/kg to 200 µg/kg administered orally, with a one- to two-dose administration generally being effective. Dosing is generally low because of the agent's high potency.

Adhering to recommended indications and doses, ivermectin is generally well-tolerated. Adverse effects include weakness, drowsiness, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. In addition, ivermectin can cause serious adverse effects, such as fever, rash, vision problems, neurotoxicity, and liver damage. Those side effects seem to arise partially from ivermectin initiating the rapid death of parasites, especially when used for the treatment of endoparasites, leading to hyperinflammation and anaphylactic reactions. Considering this pathomechanism, those effects should not occur in the treatment of viruses. However, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has registered those toxic side effects in people using ivermectin in high doses for the treatment of COVID-19.

### Randomized trial of longer-term therapy for symptoms attributed to Lyme disease [^113B9N27]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

The treatment of persistent symptoms attributed to Lyme disease remains controversial. We assessed whether longer-term antibiotic treatment of these symptoms leads to better outcomes than shorter-term treatment.

Methods: In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted in Europe, we assigned patients with persistent symptoms attributed to Lyme disease — either related temporally to proven Lyme disease or accompanied by a positive IgG or IgM immunoblot assay for Borrelia burgdorferi — to receive a 12-week oral course of doxycycline, clarithromycin plus hydroxychloroquine, or placebo. All study groups received open-label intravenous ceftriaxone for 2 weeks before initiating the randomized regimen. The primary outcome measure was health-related quality of life, assessed by the physical-component summary score of the RAND-36 Health Status Inventory (RAND SF-36) (range, 15 to 61, with higher scores indicating better quality of life), at the end of the treatment period at week 14, after the 2-week course of ceftriaxone and the 12-week course of the randomized study drug or placebo had been completed.

Results: Of the 281 patients who underwent randomization, 280 were included in the modified intention-to-treat analysis (86 patients in the doxycycline group, 96 in the clarithromycin-hydroxychloroquine group, and 98 in the placebo group). The SF-36 physical-component summary score did not differ significantly among the three study groups at the end of the treatment period, with mean scores of 35.0.

### Efficacy and safety of pharmacological treatments for acute Lyme neuroborreliosis - a systematic review [^115vB1sK]. European Journal of Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

Our aim was to evaluate the available evidence for pharmacological treatment of acute Lyme neuroborreliosis as a basis for evidence-based clinical recommendations in a systematic review.

- **Methods**: A systematic literature search of Medline, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, and three trial registries was performed. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and non-randomized studies (NRS) were evaluated. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tools. The primary outcome was 'residual neurological symptoms' while the secondary outcomes were disability, quality of life, pain, fatigue, depression, cognition, sleep, adverse events, and cerebrospinal fluid pleocytosis. The quality of the evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.

- **Results**: After screening 5779 records, eight RCTs and eight NRS were included. Risk of bias was generally high. No statistically significant difference was found between doxycycline and beta-lactam antibiotics in a meta-analysis regarding residual neurological symptoms at 4–12 months [risk ratio (RR) 1.27, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.98–1.63, P = 0.07] or adverse events [RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.54–1.25, P = 0.35]. Significantly fewer neurological symptoms for cefotaxime compared with penicillin were found [RR 1.81, 95% CI 1.10–2.97, P = 0.02]. Adverse events were significantly fewer for penicillin [RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.38–0.84, P = 0.005].

- **Conclusions**: Evidence regarding pharmacological treatment of acute Lyme neuroborreliosis is scarce and therefore insufficient.

### Unorthodox alternative therapies marketed to treat Lyme disease [^113d8AGL]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Some patients with medically unexplained symptoms or alternative medical diagnoses suspect that they chronically suffer from the tick-borne infection Lyme disease. These patients are commonly targeted by providers of alternative therapies. This study was designed to identify and characterize the range of unorthodox alternative therapies advertised to patients with a diagnosis of Lyme disease.

- **Methods**: Internet searches using the Google search engine were performed to identify the websites of clinics and services that marketed nonantimicrobial therapies for Lyme disease. We subsequently used the PubMed search engine to identify any scientific studies evaluating such treatments for Lyme disease. Websites were included in our review so long as they advertised a commercial, nonantimicrobial product or service that specifically mentioned utility for Lyme disease. Websites with patient testimonials (such as discussion groups) were excluded unless the testimonial appeared as marketing on a commercial site.

- **Results**: More than 30 alternative treatments were identified, which fell into several broad categories: these included oxygen and reactive oxygen therapy; energy and radiation-based therapies; nutritional therapy; chelation and heavy metal therapy; and biological and pharmacological therapies ranging from certain medications without recognized therapeutic effects on Borrelia burgdorferi to stem cell transplantation. Review of the medical literature did not substantiate efficacy or, in most cases, any rationale for the advertised treatments.

- **Conclusions**: Providers of alternative therapies continue to target patients with a diagnosis of Lyme disease, often without scientific evidence to support the efficacy of their treatments.

### Is ivermectin ready to be part of a public health policy for COVID-19 prophylaxis [^116g5AzX]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Low credibility.

The emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic led to a worldwide time trial in search of therapeutic alternatives that would be effective, safe, and accessible. The despair of front-line physicians in the face of increasing mortality led to the empirical use of various therapies in a sort of "war medicine". Most of the studies evaluating the efficacy of multiple therapeutic options have been carried out mainly in hospitalized patients with severe or critical illness. Most treatments have proved to be ineffective or partially effective at these stages.

At the time of writing, more than 100 million COVID-19 cases have been confirmed, and the pandemic is not close to being controlled despite all efforts. Public health interventions have included biosafety measures and lockdowns that have resulted in high socioeconomic impact. Honduras, a Central American country, is facing that impact, disadvantaged due to the lack of effective health surveillance methods and a weak public health system. Recently, several groups of physicians and multidisciplinary committees have recommended that the Honduran government establish a new public health policy to administer weekly doses of 12 to 18 mg of ivermectin massively to the healthy adult population. The argument is that there are clinical and laboratory study results that justify its use for prophylaxis and to lower the viral load of SARS-CoV-2.

### Counterpoint: Long-term antibiotic therapy improves persistent symptoms associated with Lyme disease [^113mbfbV]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Controversy exists regarding the diagnosis and treatment of Lyme disease. Patients with persistent symptoms after standard (2–4 week) antibiotic therapy for this tickborne illness have been denied further antibiotic treatment due to the perception that long-term infection with the Lyme spirochete, Borrelia burgdorferi, and associated tickborne pathogens is rare or nonexistent.

- **Methods**: I review the pathophysiology of B. burgdorferi infection and the peer-reviewed literature on diagnostic Lyme disease testing, standard treatment results, and coinfection with tickborne agents such as Babesia, Anaplasma, Ehrlichia, and Bartonella species. I also examine uncontrolled and controlled trials of prolonged antibiotic therapy in patients with persistent symptoms of Lyme disease.

- **Results**: The complex "stealth" pathology of B. burgdorferi allows the spirochete to invade diverse tissues, elude the immune response, and establish long-term infection. Commercial testing for Lyme disease is highly specific but relatively insensitive, especially during later stages of the disease. Numerous studies have documented the failure of standard antibiotic therapy in patients with Lyme disease. Previous uncontrolled trials and recent placebo-controlled trials suggest that prolonged antibiotic therapy (duration, > 4 weeks) may be beneficial for patients with persistent Lyme disease symptoms. Tickborne coinfections may increase the severity and duration of infection with B. burgdorferi.

- **Conclusions**: Prolonged antibiotic therapy may be useful and justifiable in patients with persistent symptoms.

### Treatment of post-treatment Lyme disease symptoms-a systematic review [^112AwhKu]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Low credibility.

In studies on interventions, the prognosis of early Lyme disease after antibiotic treatment is usually good, and the rate of residual symptoms is low. However, some patients experience residual symptoms as well as unspecific symptoms such as fatigue and cognitive impairment after Lyme disease. Depending on the severity of these symptoms and their functional impact, some authors refer to this incomplete resolution of symptoms after treatment of Lyme disease as post-treatment Lyme disease symptoms (PTLDs) or post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome (PTLDS).

To provide a framework for further research, a case definition of PTLDS was proposed. To fulfill criteria for PTLDS, patients are required to have a documented episode of Lyme disease, have received a recommended course of antibiotic therapy with resolution or stabilization of the objective manifestations of Lyme disease, have non-specific symptoms (persistent or relapsing) that started within six months of the Lyme disease diagnosis and lasted for at least six months after completion of antibiotic therapy, and have no other condition that explains the symptoms.

The origin of these symptoms remains a matter of emotive debate. A recent prospective study reports an increase in unspecific symptoms of 6% after an episode of Lyme disease compared with the general population. An elaborated analysis of this cohort mainly identified cognitive-behavioral variables, such as negative illness perceptions and poorer physical and social functioning, as well as higher baseline scores for depression, anxiety, fatigue, and pain as predictors.

The primary endpoints in the two treatment groups are shown in Table 2. The lower limit of the 95% confidence intervals for the difference between groups exceeded the predefined non-inferiority margin of 0.5 points, but the treatment groups were similar for superiority in both the ITT and per-protocol population. The two treatment groups were also similar with respect to clinical improvement in the subgroups definite and possible LNB: definite 6.3 vs. 6.5, p = 0.76 (mean difference = 0.2, 95% CI -1.1 to 1.5), and possible 5.8 vs. 5.9, p = 0.95 (mean difference = 0.08, 95% CI -2.9 to 2.7); and with respect to all secondary endpoints (Table 3 and Figure 2).

### Treatment of post-treatment Lyme disease symptoms-a systematic review [^114PigJk]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Low credibility.

The search identified 1274 records. After screening, 1226 records were excluded, and 48 full-text articles were retrieved for detailed examination. Of these records, nine met our inclusion criteria and corresponded to eight individual studies. All included studies were randomized controlled trials (RCTs).

Considerable heterogeneity existed regarding inclusion criteria, type of intervention, treatment duration, measured outcomes, and methods of outcome assessment among the available literature. Combined estimates for efficacy outcomes were not justified due to heterogeneous study criteria as well as differences in reporting the outcome measures.

- **Assessment of risk of bias**: One study had a low risk of bias in all assessed items. Two studies had ratings of high risk of bias in several items. Murray et al. reported a non-pharmacological intervention on post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome (PTLDS). In this study, the assessment of risk of bias was high for items such as allocation concealment, blinding of participants and personnel, blinding of outcome assessment, incomplete outcome data, and other biases. These biases included considerable imbalances regarding measurements of the respective outcomes at baseline. In the study by Cameron, the assessment of risk of bias was high for items such as allocation concealment, incomplete outcome data, and other biases, with the estimated sample size not being met, leading to considerable imbalances.

### Treatment of post-treatment Lyme disease symptoms-a systematic review [^111jHoZd]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Low credibility.

Residual symptoms after treatment of Lyme disease, sometimes called post‐treatment Lyme disease symptoms (PTLDs), are a matter of ongoing controversy. To guide treatment recommendations, a systematic review was performed of the available literature on specific treatment for PTLDs.

A systematic literature search of MEDLINE and CENTRAL was performed. No restrictions on case definitions, study types, or specific interventions were applied to enable a comprehensive overview of the available literature. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tools for randomized controlled trials. Certainty of the evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach. Outcomes of interest were quality of life, fatigue, depression, and cognition, as well as adverse events.

After screening 1,274 records, eight eligible randomized controlled trials were included. Heterogeneity was observed regarding inclusion criteria, intervention, length of treatment, and outcome measures. For efficacy outcomes, results are presented narratively due to heterogeneity. Eligible studies show no statistically significant difference between antibiotics and placebo regarding quality of life, cognition, and depression. Results for fatigue were inconsistent, whilst studies with low risk of bias showed no statistically significant difference between antibiotics and placebo. Meta‐analysis of safety outcomes showed statistically significantly more adverse events for antibiotics compared to placebo.

### Phase III clinical trial to evaluate ivermectin in the reduction of infection in the Brazilian Amazon [^112PkyMV]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2018). Low credibility.

The treatment of mansonelliasis remains a challenge due to the scarcity of clinical trials for the disease. This double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study (phase III clinical trial) was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of a single oral dose of ivermectin (0.15 mg/kg) in reducing Mansonella ozzardi microfilaraemia and the occurrence of adverse effects in infected individuals compared with a control group treated with a placebo. A total of 49 microfilaraemic patients were randomly selected from the municipality of Lábrea, State of Amazonas, in the Brazilian Amazon. Among them, 40 patients completed the study, with 19 receiving ivermectin and 21 receiving a placebo.

- **Clinical evaluation**: On the first and third days after the treatment, all patients were clinically evaluated, and the diagnosis and quantification of blood microfilariae were performed through blood filtration in polycarbonate membranes.

A significant reduction of the microfilaraemia (99.9%) was observed in the patients who received ivermectin. Slight changes in laboratory test results, without clinical significance, were noted in both the treated and control groups. Our results suggest that ivermectin is effective and safe for treating infections caused by M. ozzardi.

### Ivermectin [^112uPkUg]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

In controlled clinical trials with ivermectin cream, the most common adverse reactions (incidence ≤ 1%) included skin burning sensation and skin irritation.

- **Clinical trials experience**: Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. During clinical trials, 2,047 subjects with inflammatory lesions of rosacea received ivermectin cream once daily. A total of 1,555 subjects were treated once daily for more than 12 weeks, and 519 for approximately one year. Adverse reactions, reported in ≤ 1% of subjects treated with ivermectin cream for at least 3 months in vehicle-controlled clinical trials, included skin burning sensation and skin irritation.

- **Postmarketing experience**: Because adverse reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Local adverse reactions include contact dermatitis and allergic dermatitis.

### Six versus 2 weeks treatment with doxycycline in European Lyme neuroborreliosis: a multicentre, non-inferiority, double-blinded, randomised and placebo-controlled trial [^116quwG5]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2022). High credibility.

Irrespective of recommendations, there are clues to substantial variations in clinical practice. In a Norwegian study of adherence to guidelines, 61% of patients with LNB were treated for more than 2 weeks, 36% for more than 3 weeks, and 12% for more than 6 weeks.

Several factors are likely to influence the choice of treatment duration, such as limited evidence in guidelines, local treatment cultures, beliefs and attitudes, and pressure and expectations from patients due to advocacy in media for long duration of antibiotic treatment in LNB. High-quality research has been called for to pave the way for more evidence-based treatment decisions in clinical practice.

In light of this, we aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of treatment with oral doxycycline for 2 and 6 weeks in European LNB in a randomised controlled trial. We chose a non-inferiority approach for assessment of efficacy, as the short antibiotic regimen was not expected to be superior to the long regimen. However, it still offers clear advantages in terms of antibiotic resistance issues, lower costs, and less strain on the patients.

### Perspectives on "chronic Lyme disease" [^112xcyjJ]. The American Journal of Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

There is much controversy about the treatment of Lyme disease with respect to two poorly defined entities: "chronic Lyme disease" and "posttreatment Lyme disease syndrome". In the absence of direct evidence that these conditions are the result of a persistent infection, some mistakenly advocate extended antibiotic therapy (≥ 6 months), which can do great harm and has resulted in at least one death.

The purpose of this brief report is to review what is known from clinical research about these conditions to assist both practicing physicians and lawmakers in making sound and safe decisions with respect to treatment.

### Treatment of post-treatment Lyme disease symptoms-a systematic review [^112aDCkj]. European journal of neurology (2024). Low credibility.

The aim was to achieve a comprehensive assessment of the available literature. Two databases were searched: MEDLINE via Ovid (Ovid MEDLINE® and Epub Ahead of Print, In‐Process, In‐Data‐Review, and other Non‐Indexed Citations and Daily 1946 to July 2023) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials in July 2023 for eligible studies. The reference lists of included studies were reviewed for further eligible studies. To search sensitively, the search strategy contains a combination of subject headings and text words. The search strategy for MEDLINE is shown in Appendix S1.

To address controversy regarding the diagnosis of PTLDs as well as the wealth of literature, broad search criteria were applied with no restrictions on specific diagnostic criteria for PTLDs. No restrictions regarding study type or type of intervention were applied.

Studies were eligible for inclusion if they reported a control group (either another active treatment or placebo) and included five or more patients.

As PTLDs comprise a variety of symptoms, the primary outcomes of interest were patient‐reported outcomes, particularly quality of life, fatigue, cognition, and depression. Secondary outcomes were adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs). AEs and SAEs were considered as reported by the original authors.

### Use of ivermectin is associated with lower mortality in hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019: The ivermectin in COVID nineteen study [^114Q84Dt]. Chest (2021). Low credibility.

Ivermectin was shown to inhibit severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 replication in vitro, which has led to off-label use, but clinical efficacy had not been described previously.

- **Research question**: Does ivermectin benefit hospitalized coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients?

- **Study design and methods**: Charts of consecutive patients hospitalized at four Broward Health hospitals in Florida with confirmed COVID-19 between March 15 and May 11, 2020, treated with or without ivermectin were reviewed. Hospital ivermectin dosing guidelines were provided, but treatment decisions were made at the treating physician's discretion. The primary outcome was all-cause in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes included mortality in patients with severe pulmonary involvement, extubation rates for mechanically ventilated patients, and length of stay. Severe pulmonary involvement was defined as the need for FiO2 ≥ 50%, noninvasive ventilation, or invasive ventilation at study entry. Logistic regression and propensity score matching were used to adjust for confounders.

- **Results**: Two hundred eighty patients, 173 treated with ivermectin and 107 without ivermectin, were reviewed. Most patients in both groups also received hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, or both. Univariate analysis showed lower mortality in the ivermectin group (15.0% vs 25.2%; OR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.29–0.96; p = 0.03). Mortality was also lower among ivermectin-treated patients with severe pulmonary involvement (38.8% vs 80.7%; OR, 0.15; 95% CI, 0.05–0.47; p = 0.001). No significant differences were found in extubation rates.

### Six versus 2 weeks treatment with doxycycline in European Lyme neuroborreliosis: a multicentre, non-inferiority, double-blinded, randomised and placebo-controlled trial [^112hwq85]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2022). High credibility.

In this randomised double-blinded treatment trial in European Lyme neuroborreliosis (LNB), the primary outcome measure — improvement in a clinical scoring system (CSS) at 6 months — did not differ between patients treated with 2 and 6 weeks of doxycycline. This was consistent when analyzed in both an intent-to-treat (ITT) population, a per-protocol population, and in subgroups of patients with definite and possible LNB. However, the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval (CI) of the mean difference exceeded the predetermined non-inferiority margin of 0.5 points in both the ITT population and per-protocol population, and we can, therefore, not claim statistical non-inferiority. Still, our results strongly indicate that 6 weeks of doxycycline does not offer any benefits over 2 weeks in European LNB in adults.

This conclusion is supported by important findings besides the primary outcome. The treatment groups did not differ in any secondary outcomes, including clinical scores at 10 weeks and 12 months, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) data, and patient-reported outcomes on fatigue, subjective somatic symptoms scores, and health-related quality of life. We did not register any treatment failures in either of the two groups. The vast majority of patients improved well, though some had residual complaints. A proportion of 77% had some form of residual complaint, and 17% had at least one residual complaint that influenced daily life at 12 months after the start of treatment, which aligns with earlier findings. Depending on scoring and subgrouping, previous studies have found residual complaints in 24% to 48% at 12 months after treatment. As such, we do not regard the residual complaints as unexpected.

### Supporting drug development for neglected tropical diseases using mathematical modeling [^1117cHbR]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Low credibility.

The EOT goal for onchocerciasis places scrutiny on the efficacy of treatment options for this filarial disease. A single standard dose (150 µg/kg) of ivermectin — the cornerstone of onchocerciasis MDA — is effective in mediating the killing of the microfilarial skin-dwelling transmission stages (to blackfly vectors) of adult *Onchocerca volvulus* and in inducing a temporary sterilizing (embryostatic) effect, although suboptimal responses have been documented in Ghana. However, ivermectin only has partial killing or "curative" efficacy against adult worms and only after repeated MDA rounds.

Mathematical transmission dynamics modeling that integrates these pharmacodynamics indicates that ivermectin MDA alone, particularly if delivered annually, may be insufficient to achieve elimination in highly endemic areas where transmission is intense. In West Africa, before ivermectin MDA for onchocerciasis began in earnest in the late 1980s, transmission in 50–75% of endemic communities was deemed high (hyperendemic) or very high (holoendemic). Transmission remains ongoing in many such foci despite decades of intervention, attesting to the challenge of achieving widespread EOT by 2030.

The registration of moxidectin for the treatment of onchocerciasis in 2018 was a significant milestone in enhancing the prospects of achieving EOT. Moxidectin, like ivermectin, is a macrocyclic lactone but with superior pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, suppressing microfilariae to lower levels and for longer duration, meaning less transmission to vectors is possible between consecutive MDA rounds.

### Ivermectin for preventing and treating COVID-19 [^115uXnC2]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Low credibility.

For use of ivermectin with the intention to treat COVID-19 in an inpatient setting: all-cause mortality up to 28 days; clinical worsening or improvement of symptoms up to 28 days, assessed as the need for respiratory support; adverse events (any grade) up to 28 days; quality of life up to 28 days; duration of hospitalization; and viral clearance at seven days.

For use of ivermectin with the intention to treat COVID-19 in an outpatient setting: all-cause mortality up to 28 days; clinical worsening or improvement of symptoms up to 14 days, assessed as the need for respiratory support; admission to hospital; adverse events (any grade) up to 28 days; quality of life up to 14 days; and viral clearance at seven days.

For use of ivermectin with the intention to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection: SARS-CoV-2 infection (confirmed by RT-PCR or antigen testing) at 14 days; development of clinical COVID-19 symptoms up to 14 days, assessed in accordance with the WHO scale; adverse events (any grade) up to 14 days; all-cause mortality up to 28 days; admission to hospital at day 14; and quality of life up to 14 days.

The GRADE assessment resulted in one of four levels of certainty, and these express our confidence in the estimate of effect. High certainty: we are very confident that the true effect lies close to that of the estimate of the effect. Moderate certainty: we are moderately confident in the effect estimate; the true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect, but there is a possibility that it is substantially different. Low certainty: our confidence in the effect estimate is limited.

### Six versus 2 weeks treatment with doxycycline in European Lyme neuroborreliosis: a multicentre, non-inferiority, double-blinded, randomised and placebo-controlled trial [^115fYaJ3]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2022). High credibility.

There is limited evidence regarding the optimal duration of antibiotic treatment in neuroborreliosis. We aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of oral doxycycline for 2 and 6 weeks in European Lyme neuroborreliosis (LNB).

- **Methods**: The trial had a randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, non-inferiority design. Patients with LNB were recruited from eight Norwegian hospitals and randomised to receive doxycycline 200 mg once daily for 2 weeks, followed by 4 weeks of placebo, or doxycycline 200 mg once daily for 6 weeks. The primary endpoint was clinical improvement measured by the difference in a Composite Clinical Score (0–64 points) from baseline to 6 months. The non-inferiority margin was predetermined to be 0.5 points.

- **Results**: One hundred and twenty-one patients were included. Fifty-two treated for 2 weeks and 53 for 6 weeks were included in the intention-to-treat analyses, and 52 and 51 in the per-protocol analysis. The mean difference in clinical improvement between the groups was 0.06, 95% CI -1.2 to 1.2, p = 0.99 in the intention-to-treat population, and -0.4, 95% CI -1.4 to 0.7, p = 0.51 in the per-protocol population; non-inferiority could not be established. There were no treatment failures and no serious adverse events. The groups did not differ in secondary outcomes, including clinical scores at 10 weeks and 12 months, cerebrospinal fluid data, and patient-reported outcome measures. Patients receiving 6 weeks of doxycycline reported slightly more side effects in week 5.

- **Conclusion**: Our results strongly indicate that there are no benefits of doxycycline treatment beyond 2 weeks.

### Treatment of post-treatment Lyme disease symptoms-a systematic review [^116MMSyN]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Low credibility.

Healthcare practitioners are confronted with patients who exhibit residual symptoms after the treatment of Lyme disease, leading to demands for specific treatments in clinical practice. Some authors propose extended antibiotic treatment for patients with these residual symptoms, even in the absence of signs of ongoing infection. Several reports have highlighted severe adverse events (SAEs) and even fatalities associated with such treatments.

In this systematic review, the available literature was assessed regarding the treatment of post-treatment Lyme disease symptoms (PTLDs). The aim of this review was to summarize the available evidence to provide evidence-based guidance to healthcare practitioners dealing with patients who have residual or nonspecific symptoms following Lyme disease.

This review is not intended to acknowledge or investigate certain concepts regarding the pathogenesis of PTLDs.

### Posttreatment Lyme disease syndrome — what it might be and what it is not [^1179BsDB]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2021). Low credibility.

Lyme disease is a multisystem disease caused by Borrelia burgdorferi infection, characterized by well-defined manifestations appearing either at an early or late stage. Appropriate antibiotic therapy generally results in a favorable outcome. However, several patients report unspecific persisting symptoms such as fatigue, myalgia, arthralgia, or cognitive dysfunction months to years after adequate treatment. The underlying pathophysiological mechanism of these symptoms is unclear. There is no evidence of microbiological persistence in these cases, and attempts to resolve the symptoms through repeated or prolonged antibiotic treatment have not been convincingly successful and may be harmful.

To narrow down the controversially handled entity of posttreatment Lyme disease syndrome (PTLDS) and to avoid overdiagnosis and overtreatment, case definitions have been proposed. These definitions acknowledge PTLDS as a complex of nonspecific, subjective symptoms that are neither caused by ongoing infection nor any other identifiable disease. PTLDS is primarily a diagnosis of exclusion and requires a careful evaluation of differential diagnosis, followed by counseling about optimal management, given the lack of specific therapeutic options.

### Ivermectin for preventing and treating COVID-19 [^114esfnv]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Low credibility.

This review included 14 studies with 1,678 participants investigating ivermectin compared to placebo or standard of care for COVID-19 management. Nine studies were conducted in inpatient settings with mainly moderate COVID-19 cases (WHO 4 to 5), and four studies were conducted in outpatient settings with mild COVID-19 cases (WHO 2 to 3). One study focused on ivermectin for the prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The included studies contributed 41 results to the review, of which about one third were assessed at an overall high risk of bias. The main findings of this review are summarized in the following tables: Table 1 (treatment; inpatients), Table 2 (treatment; outpatients), and Table 3 (prevention). The number of studies per outcome was low, with only one or two studies per outcome providing useful data for our prioritized outcomes included in the summary of findings tables.

Ivermectin showed no evidence of an effect on increasing or decreasing mortality at 28 days, which was the most important outcome during the pandemic, neither in inpatients (two studies), outpatients (two studies), nor in the preventive setting (one study). The certainty of this finding was very low. The same applies to clinical worsening up to 28 days in an inpatient setting and up to 14 days in an outpatient setting.

Regarding clinical improvement, ivermectin may have little or no effect compared to placebo or standard of care on clinical improvement up to 28 days and the duration of hospitalizations in an inpatient setting. For outpatients, ivermectin may have little or no effect on the number of participants.

### Six versus 2 weeks treatment with doxycycline in European Lyme neuroborreliosis: a multicentre, non-inferiority, double-blinded, randomised and placebo-controlled trial [^112ccaHH]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2022). High credibility.

At 6 months, the proportions of patients with any complaint, including symptoms without influence on daily life, were 73% and 71% in the 2- and 6-week treatment groups, respectively. The proportions with at least one complaint influencing daily life (CCS ≥ 2) were 23% (n = 12) and 22% (n = 11). One patient treated for 6 weeks had an elevated CSF cell count at 6 months (baseline 82 M/L, 6 months 28 M/L) but had no other signs of treatment failure or disease progression, and the CSF cell count normalized at 12 months (3 M/L). We did not register any serious adverse events, and no patients were excluded or had to stop treatment because of adverse events.

- **Adverse events summary**: Weekly patient-reported side effects for 10 weeks are summarized. There was a trend towards more patients with high sum scores in weeks 3–7 in the 6-week treatment group, but the difference was statistically significant only in week 5 (p = 0.03). There were no differences in median sum scores between the treatment groups at any time point.

- **Nausea reports**: The only single question that differed between the treatment groups was the report of nausea at week 5, where nine patients reported mild and two reported serious nausea in the 6-week treatment group, as compared with three patients with mild nausea in the 2-week treatment group (p = 0.03).

At week 10, two patients, one in each group, reported similar results.

### Lyme borreliosis treatment [^116oE2S1]. Dermatologic Therapy (2008). Low credibility.

Lyme borreliosis is the most common human tick-borne illness in the Northern Hemisphere. The causative agent is the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi species complex, and hard-shell ticks of the genus Ixodes are responsible for pathogen transmission from animals to humans. The incidence of the disease is increasing year by year, and although Lyme disease is not fatal, it can affect the skin, heart, nervous, and musculoskeletal systems, impairing quality of life. Appropriate diagnosis of Lyme disease should be promptly treated with antibiotics to prevent the late stage of the disease. The choice of antibiotics depends on many factors, such as the stage of the disease, drug efficacy, adverse effects, type of delivery, duration of treatment, and cost. Treatment failure may occur for various reasons, and re-infection is possible. The recommended treatment schedule in the Czech Republic is presented.

### Serious bacterial infections acquired during treatment of patients given a diagnosis of chronic Lyme disease - United States [^1133KV9C]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2017). Low credibility.

Patients given a diagnosis of chronic Lyme disease have been prescribed various treatments for which there is often no evidence of effectiveness, including extended courses of antibiotics (lasting months to years), IV infusions of hydrogen peroxide, immunoglobulin therapy, hyperbaric oxygen therapy, electromagnetic frequency treatments, garlic supplements, colloidal silver, and stem cell transplants. At least five randomized, placebo-controlled studies have shown that prolonged courses of IV antibiotics, in particular, do not substantially improve the long-term outcome for patients with a diagnosis of chronic Lyme disease and can result in serious harm, including death.

Clinicians and state health departments periodically contact CDC concerning patients who have acquired serious bacterial infections during treatments for chronic Lyme disease. Five illustrative cases described to CDC over the past several years are presented.

### Oral ivermectin for treatment of pediculosis capitis [^117Vbg5t]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Pediculosis capitis is a highly transmissible infestation prevalent worldwide. It is an important public health problem mainly affecting children. The emergence of drug resistance and high rates of treatment failure with several topical agents make ivermectin, an antiparasitic drug, an attractive therapeutic option for lice control.

- **Objective**: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral ivermectin in the treatment of a pediatric population with pediculosis capitis.

- **Methods**: Children with pediculosis capitis, aged 6 to 15 years, were recruited from an indigenous community in Mexico and treated with a single dose of oral ivermectin at 200 μg/kg. A second dose of ivermectin was administered 1 week later if there was evidence of persistent infestation.

- **Results**: Forty-four children (mean age, 9.8 years) with active infestation were treated. A single approximately 200-μg/kg dose of ivermectin eradicated adult lice in all children. Forty-one percent (n = 18) required a second dose because of the presence of viable nits. At the third visit, 2 weeks after commencement of treatment, there was no evidence of viable nits. Complete resolution of excoriations was observed in all children, and minimal or no symptoms of pruritus were reported in 93% (n = 41). There were no significant adverse effects due to ivermectin administration.

- **Conclusions**: Ivermectin demonstrates high efficacy and tolerability in the treatment of pediculosis capitis in children. A significant number of children required a second dose to ensure complete eradication.

### Ivermectin for preventing and treating COVID-19 [^116HAwPf]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Low credibility.

- **Methods for future updates**: Our information specialist (MIM) will provide us with new search records each week, which two review authors will screen, extract, evaluate, and integrate following the guidance for Cochrane living systematic reviews (Cochrane LSR). We will manually check platform trials for new treatment arms investigating ivermectin.

- **Conditions for republishing the review**: We will wait until the accumulating evidence changes our conclusions of the implications of research and practice before republishing the review. We will consider one or more of the following components to inform this decision:
	- The findings of one or more prioritized outcomes.
	- The credibility (e.g. GRADE rating) of one or more prioritized outcomes.
	- New settings, populations, interventions, comparisons, or outcomes studied.

In case of emerging policy relevance due to global controversies around the intervention, we will consider republishing an updated review even though our conclusions remain unchanged. We will review the scope and methods approximately monthly, or more frequently if appropriate, in light of potential changes in COVID‐19 research (e.g. when additional comparisons, interventions, subgroups, outcomes, or new review methods become available).

### Treatment of post-treatment Lyme disease symptoms-a systematic review [^112KmheN]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Low credibility.

A summary is provided of the available evidence based on a comprehensive literature search, a systematic and structured assessment of risk of bias, as well as an assessment of the certainty of the available evidence applying the GRADE approach.

Evidence from the available RCTs does not support a benefit of antibiotic treatment regarding efficacy. Furthermore, the available literature shows a statistically significantly higher rate of adverse events (AEs) with antibiotic treatment compared to placebo. Available RCTs show no statistically significant difference between antibiotics and placebo regarding serious adverse events (SAEs); however, this finding is questionable due to the limited event size. SAEs and even fatalities after extended antibiotic treatment have been reported repeatedly. Aside from AEs, overuse of antibiotic treatment adds to the global crisis of emerging antibiotic resistance and should be avoided. Antibiotic treatment should not be used in patients with post-treatment Lyme disease symptoms (PTLDs).

### Effect of ivermectin vs placebo on time to sustained recovery in outpatients with mild to moderate COVID-19: A randomized clinical trial [^112YG4Ba]. JAMA (2022). High credibility.

The study ACTIV-6 (ivermectin) was published by Susanna Naggie and colleagues in 2022 in the journal JAMA. This study is related to COVID-19 infection. The ACTIV-6 (ivermectin) study sought to answer the question: what is the role of ivermectin in outpatients with mild to moderate symptomatic COVID-19 infection? It employed a multi-center, double-blinded, randomized clinical trial (RCT) design.

The study population consisted of 1,591 patients, of which 933 were female and 658 were male. Inclusion criteria required patients to be aged ≥ 30 years with confirmed COVID-19, experiencing at least two symptoms of acute infection for seven days or less. Key exclusion criteria included a prior diagnosis of COVID-19 infection, current or recent hospitalization, and known allergy, hypersensitivity, or contraindication to the study drug.

In terms of interventions, the study involved 817 patients receiving ivermectin at a dose of 400 mcg/kg daily for three days and 774 patients receiving a matching placebo daily for three days.

The primary outcome indicated no significant difference in the median time to sustained recovery, which was 12 days for the ivermectin group versus 13 days for the placebo group (HR 0.93, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.04).

- **Secondary outcomes**: No significant difference was observed in the rate of hospitalization or death by day 28 (1.22% vs. 1.16%; HR 1.1, 95% CI 0.4 to 2.6). Additionally, there was no significant difference in the rate of the composite outcome of hospitalization, urgent or emergency care visit, or death by day 28 (3.9% vs. 3.6%; HR 1.2, 95% CI 0.6 to 1.8).

- **Safety outcomes**: No significant safety concerns were reported.

The 2021 guidelines from AAN/ACR/IDSA recommend specific protocols for follow-up and surveillance in Lyme disease, particularly concerning indications for referral. Patients who have not responded to one course of oral antibiotics and one course of IV antibiotics should be considered for referral to a rheumatologist or another trained specialist. These specialists can evaluate the use of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), biologic agents, intraarticular steroids, or arthroscopic synovectomy.

### Ivermectin for preventing and treating COVID-19 [^111paeuk]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Low credibility.

We collected information on outcomes from all time points reported in the publications. If only a few trials contributed data to an outcome, we pooled different time points, provided the trials had produced valid data and pooling was clinically reasonable.

In the case of time-to-event analysis, such as time to death, we included the outcome measure based on the longest follow-up time and measured from randomization. We reported time points of outcome measurement in the footnotes of the forest plots.

- **Serious adverse events**: We included serious adverse events and adverse events occurring during the trial period, including those during active treatment and long-term adverse events as well. If sufficient data are available for review updates, we will group the measurement time points of eligible outcomes into those measured directly after treatment (up to 7 days), medium-term outcomes (up to 14 days), and longer-term outcomes (28 days or more).

This review update has no secondary outcomes. We treated all outcomes as a primary outcome set which informed the summary of findings tables.

### Lyme disease: Review [^114KtSDv]. Archives of Medical Science (2012). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on Lyme disease:

- **Definition**: Lyme disease is a tick-borne infectious disease that principally affects the skin, nervous system, musculoskeletal system, and heart.

- **Pathophysiology**: Lyme disease is caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi, Borrelia afzelii, and Borrelia garinii.

- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of Lyme disease in the US is estimated at 15.9–381.4 cases per 100,000 person-years.

- **Disease course**: The host-pathogen interaction elicits an inflammatory response with the production of cytokines, matrix glycosaminoglycans, extracellular matrix proteins, and antibodies, resulting in erythema migrans. The dissemination of the disease leads to multiple erythema migrans, meningitis, cranial nerve palsies, carditis, and arthritis.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Doxycycline, amoxicillin, and cefuroxime axetil are about 90% effective in treating erythema migrans.
