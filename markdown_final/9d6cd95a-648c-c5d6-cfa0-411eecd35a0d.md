## Question

When is surigical intervention necessary for crtitical limb ischemia

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking when surgical intervention is necessary for critical limb ischemia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining CLI and confirming the diagnostic thresholds that trigger intervention. Then, I should verify the overarching principle that revascularization is the cornerstone of therapy and when it is indicated. Next, I will examine the choice between endovascular and open surgical strategies, including BEST-CLI and guideline-based selection criteria. After that, I need to check the specific scenarios where surgery is preferred or necessary, including anatomy, failed endovascular therapy, and conduit availability. Finally, I should review when primary amputation is appropriate and synthesize a practical decision framework with urgency modifiers and follow-up considerations.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entity and diagnostic thresholds. CLI, now termed chronic limb-threatening ischemia, is defined by ischemic rest pain, nonhealing ischemic ulceration, or gangrene attributable to arterial insufficiency, with objective evidence of impaired perfusion such as ankle pressure ≤ 50 mmHg, toe pressure ≤ 30 mmHg, or abnormal TcPO2, and these findings distinguish CLI from less severe PAD and establish the need for revascularization rather than conservative therapy alone [^b11ca637] [^92316bde].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should verify the principle that revascularization is the cornerstone. Multiple high-credibility guidelines converge on the same message: in patients with CLI, revascularization should be performed when feasible to minimize tissue loss, and this applies to both endovascular and open surgical approaches, with the choice individualized to patient risk, limb severity, and anatomic complexity using the PLAN framework (Patient risk, Limb severity, Anatomic complexity) [^bd307349] [^92316bde] [^f19f6e9e].

> Next, I should review the comparative effectiveness question between endovascular therapy and surgery. Historically, there was equipoise, but wait, let me verify the most definitive data. The BEST-CLI randomized trial demonstrated that in patients with adequate single-segment saphenous vein, surgical bypass reduced major adverse limb events compared with endovascular therapy, whereas in those without good vein, outcomes were more comparable, reinforcing that conduit quality shifts the balance toward surgery in selected patients [^b984278b]. Earlier systematic reviews and meta-analyses suggested no clear mortality difference but highlighted trade-offs in patency and reintervention, which aligns with the notion that modality selection should be individualized rather than defaulting to endovascular therapy in all-comers [^0b870765] [^7d161bf3].

> I will now examine when surgery is specifically indicated or preferred. Let me think about anatomy first: extensive aortoiliac disease, long-segment femoropopliteal or multilevel tibial disease, and GLASS stage III complexity favor open surgical reconstruction, particularly when a good autologous vein conduit is available, because durable bypass can outperform endovascular therapy in these settings [^ec0289b1] [^f19f6e9e]. But wait, what if endovascular therapy fails or is not feasible? Guidelines support open surgery after failed endovascular attempts or when endovascular options are limited by anatomy or chronic total occlusions that are unlikely to yield durable patency, again assuming acceptable surgical risk and suitable targets [^27dc22de] [^ec0289b1].

> I should confirm the role of conduit and patient selection. Autologous vein is the preferred conduit for infrainguinal bypass in CLTI, and its availability materially improves outcomes; in average-risk patients with advanced limb threat and good vein, surgery is favored, whereas high-risk patients with limited life expectancy or poor functional status may be better served by an endovascular-first strategy despite lower durability [^ad0da86c] [^f19f6e9e] [^79ff00e6]. Hold on, I should verify the risk stratification: contemporary guidelines define average surgical risk as anticipated perioperative mortality less than 5% and 2-year survival greater than 50%, which helps frame candidacy for open surgery [^902a0b87].

> Let me consider infection and tissue loss, because this changes urgency and the sequence of care. In the presence of deep space foot infection or wet gangrene, urgent surgical drainage and debridement, often with minor amputation, is mandatory concurrent with or before revascularization to control sepsis and prevent rapid limb loss, and this timing decision should be individualized based on the severity of infection and ischemia [^3b182a0e] [^58b28566]. I should double-check that this aligns with wound-first principles in high-grade infection, which it does in contemporary multidisciplinary guidance [^3b182a0e].

> Now, I need to ensure I address when not to revascularize and when to choose primary amputation. Primary major amputation is appropriate after shared decision-making in patients with non-salvageable limbs, poor functional status, limited life expectancy, or when the limb is the source of life-threatening instability such as uncontrolled sepsis or metabolic derangement; a multidisciplinary team should assess revascularization options before amputation whenever feasible [^a4f754e8] [^0612d9b1] [^df786abb] [^146535a3]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought "absolute indication" for surgery included all Rutherford 6 presentations, but I should correct that: even in tissue loss, endovascular therapy may still be reasonable depending on anatomy and patient risk, so surgery is not universally mandated in Rutherford 6, though many such cases will benefit from open reconstruction when anatomy and conduit align [^f19f6e9e] [^b984278b].

> Next, I should review urgency modifiers that convert elective planning into urgent action. Rapidly progressive gangrene, expanding infection, intractable rest pain unresponsive to dependency, and hemodynamic instability are unstable conditions that warrant expedited revascularization or amputation to prevent imminent limb loss, and this urgency should be integrated with infection control and systemic optimization [^b11ca637] [^3b182a0e]. Hold on, I should verify that guidelines endorse prompt revascularization in unstable CLI, which they do, emphasizing time-sensitive limb salvage pathways [^bd307349].

> I will now synthesize a practical decision framework. First, confirm the diagnosis and stage limb threat using WIfI and GLASS to quantify ischemia, infection, and anatomic complexity. Second, assess patient risk and life expectancy to classify surgical candidacy. Third, determine whether endovascular therapy is likely to achieve durable in-line flow based on lesion length, calcification, and outflow. Fourth, prioritize surgery when there is advanced limb threat, complex multilevel disease, failed endovascular therapy, or high-quality autologous vein, and prioritize endovascular therapy in high-risk patients with limited life expectancy or simple focal disease. Finally, integrate infection control, wound care logistics, and patient preferences through shared decision-making [^f19f6e9e] [^902a0b87] [^bd307349]. Let me reconsider whether this aligns with contemporary guidance; yes, this PLAN-based, multidisciplinary approach is explicitly endorsed in the SVS Global Vascular Guidelines and reflected in BEST-CLI's stratified design and outcomes [^f19f6e9e] [^b984278b].

> Finally, I should confirm follow-up and durability considerations because they influence the initial choice. Structured surveillance with clinical assessment, duplex ultrasound, and timely reintervention for failing grafts or stents improves long-term patency and limb salvage, and this is particularly relevant after endovascular therapy given higher reintervention rates, whereas surgical bypass, when successful, offers more durable patency at the cost of higher perioperative morbidity [^fb7de30c] [^acc85ad1] [^7d161bf3]. I need to ensure patients understand these trade-offs and the need for lifelong cardiovascular risk modification and wound care after any revascularization, which is consistently emphasized in guidelines and outcomes literature [^bd307349] [^9b1a21c7].

---

Surgical intervention is indicated for critical limb ischemia (CLI) when there is **rest pain, tissue loss, or gangrene** with objective evidence of severe arterial insufficiency, and when **revascularization is feasible** to prevent limb loss [^bd307349] [^92316bde]. Surgery is prioritized when there is **extensive multilevel disease**, **failed or unsuitable endovascular therapy**, or when a good autologous vein conduit is available [^ec0289b1] [^27dc22de] [^ad0da86c]. Primary amputation is reserved for non-salvageable limbs, poor functional status, or high surgical risk after shared decision-making [^a4f754e8] [^0612d9b1]. Urgent surgery is required for **rapidly progressing ischemia, infection, or gangrene** to prevent imminent limb loss [^b11ca637] [^3b182a0e].

---

## Indications for surgical intervention in CLI

Surgical intervention is indicated in CLI based on **clinical presentation, severity of ischemia, and patient-specific factors**. The following scenarios commonly necessitate surgical intervention:

- **Rest pain**: Persistent ischemic rest pain unresponsive to conservative therapy [^b11ca637].

- **Tissue loss**: Non-healing ulcers or gangrene due to arterial insufficiency [^b11ca637].

- **Failed endovascular therapy**: Persistent symptoms or failure of endovascular intervention [^27dc22de].

- **Extensive multilevel disease**: Complex anatomy unsuitable for endovascular therapy [^ec0289b1].

- **Good autologous vein conduit**: Availability of suitable vein for bypass grafting [^ad0da86c].

---

## Timing of surgical intervention

The timing of surgical intervention in CLI is **critical** and depends on the severity of ischemia, presence of infection, and patient comorbidities:

- **Urgent intervention**: Indicated for rapidly progressing ischemia, infection, or gangrene to prevent imminent limb loss [^b11ca637] [^3b182a0e].

- **Elective intervention**: Appropriate for stable CLI without active infection, allowing for preoperative optimization and planning [^b11ca637].

- **Primary amputation**: Considered for non-salvageable limbs, poor functional status, or high surgical risk after shared decision-making [^a4f754e8] [^0612d9b1].

---

## Surgical options for CLI

Several **surgical options** are available for CLI, including:

| **Surgical option** | **Indication** | **Advantages** | **Disadvantages** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Bypass surgery | - Extensive multilevel disease <br/> - Failed endovascular therapy <br/> - Good autologous vein conduit | - Durable long-term results <br/> - High limb salvage rates | - Higher perioperative morbidity <br/> - Longer recovery |
| Endarterectomy | - Localized arterial lesions <br/> - Common femoral artery disease | - Effective for localized disease <br/> - Durable results | - Limited applicability <br/> - Higher perioperative risk |
| Primary amputation | - Non-salvageable limb <br/> - Poor functional status <br/> - High surgical risk | - Definitive solution <br/> - Prevents ongoing morbidity | - Permanent disability <br/> - Psychological impact |

---

## Factors influencing surgical decision-making

The decision to proceed with surgical intervention in CLI is influenced by several factors:

- **Patient comorbidities**: Cardiovascular risk, renal function, and overall health status [^902a0b87].

- **Anatomical considerations**: Extent and location of arterial disease, availability of suitable conduit [^f19f6e9e].

- **Severity of ischemia**: Degree of tissue loss, infection, and gangrene [^6c1cebfe].

- **Patient preferences**: Informed consent and shared decision-making [^a4f754e8].

---

## Outcomes and prognosis

Surgical intervention in CLI significantly improves outcomes, including:

- **Limb salvage**: Reduced risk of major amputation [^b984278b].

- **Quality of life**: Improved functional status and quality of life [^24f0a4bd].

- **Survival**: Potential improvement in long-term survival, although mortality remains high due to systemic cardiovascular disease [^2916b424].

---

## Conclusion

Surgical intervention is indicated in CLI for patients with **rest pain, tissue loss, or gangrene** when revascularization is feasible and likely to prevent limb loss. The timing and choice of surgical procedure depend on patient-specific factors, anatomical considerations, and the severity of ischemia. Urgent intervention is required for rapidly progressing ischemia or infection, while elective surgery is appropriate for stable cases. Primary amputation is reserved for non-salvageable limbs or high-risk patients after shared decision-making.

### Design and rationale of the best endovascular versus best surgical therapy for patients with critical limb ischemia (BEST-CLI) trial [^639bc312]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Critical limb ischemia (CLI) is increasing in prevalence, and remains a significant source of mortality and limb loss. The decision to recommend surgical or endovascular revascularization for patients who are candidates for both varies significantly among providers and is driven more by individual preference than scientific evidence.

Methods and Results

The Best Endovascular Versus Best Surgical Therapy for Patients With Critical Limb Ischemia (BEST-CLI) Trial is a prospective, randomized, multidisciplinary, controlled, superiority trial designed to compare treatment efficacy, functional outcomes, quality of life, and cost in patients undergoing best endovascular or best open surgical revascularization. Approximately 140 clinical sites in the United States and Canada will enroll 2100 patients with CLI who are candidates for both treatment options. A pragmatic trial design requires consensus on patient eligibility by at least 2 investigators, but leaves the choice of specific procedural strategy within the assigned revascularization approach to the individual treating investigator. Patients with suitable single-segment of saphenous vein available for potential bypass will be randomized within Cohort 1 (n = 1620), while patients without will be randomized within Cohort 2 (n = 480). The primary efficacy end point of the trial is Major Adverse Limb Event-Free Survival. Key secondary end points include Re-intervention and Amputation-Free-Survival and Amputation Free-Survival.

Conclusions

The BEST-CLI trial is the first randomized controlled trial comparing endovascular therapy to open surgical bypass in patients with CLI to be carried out in North America. This landmark comparative effectiveness trial aims to provide Level I data to clarify the appropriate role for both treatment strategies and help define an evidence-based standard of care for this challenging patient population.

### Surveillance and follow-up after revascularization for critical limb ischemia [^fb7de30c]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

The purpose of a structured and cost-effective surveillance program after surgical or endovascular intervention for critical limb ischemia is to optimize limb salvage and preserve arterial repair function. Surveillance programs should include clinical, vascular laboratory, and radiographic follow-up, and, when a high-grade progressive stenosis is identified, appropriately timed intervention should be performed. Because many patients with critical limb ischemia are older and many are frail with limited mobility, optimizing the durability of arterial intervention and keeping these patients ambulatory is an important factor in retaining an independent lifestyle and quality of life. Despite the importance of surveillance after arterial intervention, there is a lack of consensus in the literature regarding the efficacy of surveillance, how it should be performed, and well-defined evidence-based guidelines. This review provides an up-to-date scrutiny on this topic and provides recommendations for optimal testing methods, limitations of surveillance testing, and when and how to intervene. These recommendations should be considered in the care of the patient with critical limb ischemia, but with the understanding that patients vary widely and care should be individualized.

### The BEST-CLI trial: a multidisciplinary effort to assess whether surgical or endovascular therapy is better for patients with critical limb ischemia [^1fe78d37]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Critical limb ischemia (CLI) is the most severe form of peripheral arterial disease and is associated with a risk of limb loss. This vascular condition is currently treated with limb revascularization by surgery or endovascular intervention performed by a variety of specialists. Because both open vascular bypass and the less invasive endovascular therapy can be performed in selected patients with CLI, there exists significant disagreement as to which therapy should be performed first and which is more successful. The paucity of comparative effectiveness data to guide treatment of CLI has prompted a multidisciplinary effort to organize the Best Endovascular Versus Best Surgical Therapy in Patients With CLI (BEST-CLI) trial. The BEST-CLI trial is a pragmatic, multicenter, open-label, randomized trial that compares best endovascular therapy with best open surgical treatment in patients eligible for both treatments. BEST-CLI aims to provide urgently needed clinical guidance for CLI management by using a pragmatic design comparing the effectiveness of established techniques while allowing for the introduction of newer therapies as they become available; a novel primary endpoint that includes limb amputation rates, repeat intervention, and mortality; a multidisciplinary structure that fosters cooperation among interventional cardiologists, interventional radiologists, vascular surgeons, and vascular medicine specialists; and novel techniques to evaluate the cost-effectiveness and quality-of-life outcomes of the two treatment strategies being tested.

### Critical limb ischemia [^20ca1254]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Critical limb ischemia (CLI) continues to be a significantly morbid disease process for the aging population. Rigid guidelines for the management of patients with CLI are inappropriate due to the complexities that are involved in optimally treating these patients. A thin line exists in the decision process between medical management vs surgical management by revascularization or amputation, and the perception of "success" in this patient population is evolving. This review explores these issues and examines the challenges the treating physician will face when managing the care of patients with CLI. The epidemiology and natural history of CLI is discussed, along with the pathophysiology of the disease process. A review of the literature in regards to the different treatment modalities is presented to help the physician optimize therapy for patients with CLI. New scoring systems to help predict outcomes in patients with CLI undergoing revascularization or amputation are discussed, and an overview of the current status of patient-oriented outcomes is provided. Finally, we briefly examine emerging therapies for the treatment of CLI and provide an algorithm to help guide the practicing physician on how to approach the critically ischemic limb with regard to the complicated issues surrounding these patients.

### The BEST-CLI trial: a multidisciplinary effort to assess which therapy is best for patients with critical limb ischemia [^8b8ddea2]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2014). Low credibility.

Critical limb ischemia (CLI) is the most severe form of peripheral arterial disease and is associated with a significant risk of limb loss. It is currently treated with limb revascularization by a variety of specialists. Although both open vascular bypass and endovascular therapy are offered to patients with infrainguinal peripheral arterial disease and CLI, significant disagreement exists as to which therapy works best in candidates for both types of intervention. Persistent clinical equipoise in combination with a paucity of comparative effectiveness data to guide treatment of CLI has led to a multidisciplinary effort to organize the Best Endovascular versus Best Surgical Therapy in patients with CLI (BEST-CLI) trial. The BEST-CLI trial is a pragmatic, multicenter, open label, randomized trial that compares best endovascular therapy with best open surgical treatment in patients eligible for both treatments. This trial is highly innovative in both its design and its collaborative nature. BEST-CLI aims to provide urgently needed clinical guidance for CLI management by using (1) a pragmatic design comparing the effectiveness of established techniques while allowing for the introduction of newer therapies as they become available; (2) a novel primary end point that includes limb amputation rates, repeat intervention, and mortality; (3) a multidisciplinary structure that fosters cooperation among interventional cardiologists, interventional radiologists, vascular surgeons, and vascular medicine specialists; and (4) novel techniques to evaluate the cost-effectiveness and quality-of-life outcomes of the 2 treatment strategies being tested.

### Functional outcome of critical limb ischemia [^09e851a2]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Results of treatment for critical limb ischemia have traditionally focused on physician-oriented end points related to limb salvage surgery. Although numerous studies have demonstrated excellent patency and limb salvage after surgical revascularization procedures, survival in this patient population is poor, comorbidities reducing quality of life are rampant, and recovery from limb salvage surgery can be prolonged and complicated despite "success" as defined by traditional reporting methods. Patient-oriented outcome end points, such as health- related quality of life and functional status, are essential in defining optimal treatment options for the population of patients with critical limb ischemia. This area of research remains in its infancy, but will become increasingly important as the population of patients with critical limb ischemia and treatment options for these patients continue to expand. The current status and future outlook of functional and quality of life assessment of patients with critical limb ischemia is reviewed.

### Complete ulcer healing as primary endpoint in studies on critical limb ischemia? A critical reappraisal [^4a76949d]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Objectives

Although complete ulcer healing is the mandatory primary efficacy criterion in current European guidelines for drug trials in critical limb ischemia (CLI), the appropriateness of this endpoint has been questioned for some time. We carried out a systematic review to assess the value of this endpoint in studies on reconstructive measures, considered to be the standard of care for CLI.

Methods

A computerized literature search (1985–2005) was performed to track down clinical studies on endovascular and surgical interventions by using the search terms CLI and ulcer healing and their synonyms.

Results

1,914 papers on revascularization in CLI were identified. Complete ulcer healing was reported in 17 studies (0.9%). Among these, there were no randomized controlled trials, five prospective cohorts on endovascular procedures, and six retrospective cohorts for endovascular and surgical procedures, respectively. If healing rates or time to ulcer healing were available, they differed greatly between the studies without consistent correlation to types of therapy.

Conclusions

In past and current literature, complete ulcer healing is not a consistently reported criterion for success of revascularization in CLI. Thus, its appropriateness for efficacy assessment of drug studies in CLI patients has to be questioned.

### Lower extremity critical limb ischemia: a review of clinical features and management [^a6594050]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Lower extremity critical limb ischemia (CLI) represents symptoms related to end-stage atherosclerotic peripheral arterial disease manifested by rest pain and tissue loss. It is associated with increased risk of limb amputation and cardiovascular-related mortality. The prevalence and cost of CLI are expected to increase with both the aging of the U.S. population and continued influence of smoking and diabetes. Treatments encompass measures to reduce cardiovascular risk and preserve limb viability. Despite increasing popularity of endovascular modalities, revascularization with either surgical bypass or endovascular intervention is the cornerstone of therapy. Adequate Level I data to guide decisions regarding optimal strategies to treat CLI, particularly in patients who are candidates for both open and percutaneous approaches, are currently lacking. Ongoing randomized controlled trials aim to resolve the clinical equipoise.

### Critical appraisal of surgical revascularization for critical limb ischemia [^212278d0]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Peripheral artery disease is growing in global prevalence and is estimated to afflict between 8 and 12 million Americans. Its most severe form, critical limb ischemia (CLI), is associated with high rates of limb loss, morbidity, and mortality. Revascularization is the cornerstone of limb preservation in CLI, and has traditionally been accomplished with open surgical bypass. Advances in catheter-based technologies, coupled with their broad dissemination among specialists, have led to major shifts in practice patterns in CLI. There is scant high-quality evidence to guide surgical decision making in this arena, and market forces have exerted profound influences. Despite this, available data suggest that the expected outcomes for both endovascular and open surgery in CLI are strongly dependent on definable patient factors such as anatomic distribution of disease, vein quality, and comorbidities. Optimal patient selection is paramount for maximizing benefit with each technique. This review summarizes some of the existing data and suggests a selective approach to revascularization in CLI, which continues to rely on vein bypass surgery as a primary option in appropriately selected patients.

### Critical limb ischemia: an expert statement [^dc801e48]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

Critical limb ischemia (CLI), the most advanced form of peripheral artery disease, is associated with significant morbidity, mortality, and health care resource utilization. It is also associated with physical, as well as psychosocial, consequences such as amputation and depression. Importantly, after a major amputation, patients are at heightened risk of amputation on the contralateral leg. However, despite the technological advances to manage CLI with minimally invasive technologies, this condition often remains untreated, with significant disparities in revascularization and amputation rates according to race, socioeconomic status, and geographic region. Care remains disparate across medical specialties in this rapidly evolving field. Many challenges persist, including appropriate reimbursement for treating complex patients with difficult anatomy. This paper provides a comprehensive summary that includes diagnostic assessment and analysis, endovascular versus open surgical treatment, regenerative and adjunctive therapies, and other important aspects of CLI.

### The current state of critical limb ischemia: a systematic review [^4183630a]. JAMA Surgery (2016). Medium credibility.

Importance

Chronic critical limb ischemia, marked by intractable lower extremity ischemic rest pain and tissue loss, is a highly morbid condition that leads to the loss of ambulation and decreased quality of life. It is associated with a high risk of limb loss and mortality and presents a significant economic burden to society.

Objective

To review the current state of epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of critical limb ischemia.

Evidence Review

An extensive literature search of the subject matter was conducted on material published in English between 1980 and 2016; both landmark and recently published articles were evaluated. Articles were reviewed if they included the terms critical limb ischemia, ischemic rest pain, gangrene, or extremity ulcers.

Findings

Critical limb ischemia represents the end stage of peripheral arterial disease. Because peripheral arterial disease is most commonly caused by atherosclerosis, critical limb ischemia is heavily associated with smoking and diabetes. Revascularization is the cornerstone of therapy to prevent limb amputation, and both open vascular surgery and endovascular therapy play a key role in the treatment of patients with critical limb ischemia. However, few scientific data are available to identify the optimal revascularization strategy, which has led to a significant amount of variability and equipoise in the treatment of this condition. Medical therapy plays a significant role in optimizing coexistent cardiovascular risk factors and a limited role in improving limb outcomes in nonrevascularizable disease.

Conclusions and Relevance

Understanding critical limb ischemia and its treatment strategies is important for providing the best care for affected patients. Currently, ongoing randomized clinical trials in North America and the United Kingdom aim to provide data to support the best management of these patients.

### Critical limb ischemia: current trends and future directions [^70ccc872]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

There are some pertinent questions that need to be answered in future clinical studies, which will — at least partially — be addressed by the abovementioned trials. The most important issues are the following: First, which clinical staging system is useful to predict outcome in severe limb ischemia patients and is it reproducible? Second, can we improve secondary prevention in PAD patients, with respect to both the number of patients prescribed medication to prevent future cardiovascular events and also in providing a more personal‐based medication profile (eg, based on antiplatelet testing)? Third, what is the actual incidence of CLI and what is the prognosis of the contemporary CLI patient? Fourth, can we identify patients who are best treated with a surgical or an endovascular approach? Fifth, can gene or cell therapy provide an alternative option in the therapeutic armamentarium of (no‐option) severe limb ischemia patients? And sixth and foremost, can we identify patients at risk for and prevent them from advancing to CLI?

Addressing these issues and further improving treatment and outcomes of PAD patients worldwide and in all socioeconomic segments of the population requires collaborative international, national, and local efforts. As funding strategies for PAD are uncommon, public or private initiatives are essential, 85 which could be enhanced by increased public awareness of PAD and its implications for public health, such as cardiovascular risk, influence on quality of life, and expenditure of healthcare resources.

Regarding surgical interventions for chronic limb-threatening ischemia, more specifically with respect to amputation, primary amputation, CCS 2022 guidelines recommend to perform primary major amputation in patients with CLTI with non-reconstructible disease, non-salvageable limb, non-ambulatory status, severe sepsis, or for palliation of patients with a short life expectancy and unfit for revascularization.

### Comparative effectiveness of endovascular and surgical revascularization for patients with peripheral artery disease and critical limb ischemia: systematic review of revascularization in critical limb ischemia [^0b870765]. American Heart Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Background

For patients with critical limb ischemia (CLI), the optimal treatment to enhance limb preservation, prevent death, and improve functional status is unknown. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the comparative effectiveness of endovascular revascularization and surgical revascularization in patients with CLI.

Methods

We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews for relevant English-language studies published from January 1995 to August 2012. Two investigators screened each abstract and full-text article for inclusion, abstracted the data, and performed quality ratings and evidence grading. Random-effects models were used to compute summary estimates of effects, with endovascular treatment as the control group.

Results

We identified a total of 23 studies, including 1 randomized controlled trial, which reported no difference in amputation-free survival at 3 years (odds ratio [OR] 1.22, 95% CI 0.84–1.77) and all-cause mortality (OR 1.07, 0.73–1.56) between the 2 treatments. Meta-analysis of the observational studies showed a statistically nonsignificant reduction in all-cause mortality at 6 months (11 studies, OR 0.85, 0.57–1.27) and amputation-free survival at 1 year (2 studies, OR 0.76, 0.48–1.21) in patients treated with endovascular revascularization. There was no difference in overall death, amputation, or amputation-free survival at ≥ 2 years.

Conclusions

The currently available literature suggests that there is no difference in clinical outcomes for patients with CLI treated with endovascular or surgical revascularization. There is a paucity of high-quality data available to guide clinical decision making, especially as it pertains to patient subgroups or anatomical considerations.

### Abstract… [^b11ca637]. AAFP (1999). Low credibility.

American Family Physician. 1) As vessel narrowing increases, critical limb ischemia can develop when the blood flow does not meet the metabolic demands of tissue at rest. While critical limb ischemia may be due to an acute condition such as an embolus or thrombosis, most cases are the progressive result of a chronic condition, most commonly atherosclerosis. Chronic critical limb ischemia is defined not only by the clinical presentation but also by an objective measurement of impaired blood flow. Criteria for diagnosis include either one of the following more than two weeks of recurrent foot pain at rest that requires regular use of analgesics and is associated with an ankle systolic pressure of 50 mm Hg or less, or a toe systolic pressure of 30 mm Hg or less, or a nonhealing wound or gangrene of the foot or toes, with similar hemodynamic measurements.

Further intervention may be required if conservative therapy does not lead to improvement, as indicated by increasing wound size, persistent or spreading infection or no evidence of healing after four to eight weeks. Progressive gangrene, rapidly enlarging wounds and continuous ischemic rest pain unrelieved by dependency are each unstable conditions that can rapidly lead to limb loss and require urgent intervention. However, many patients with critical limb ischemia have a stable or slowly progressive presentation. Review of the data reveals that patients with chronic critical limb ischemia have a three-year limb loss rate of about 40 percent. 13–16 This suggests that a substantial proportion of patients with critical ischemia are not at risk of imminent limb loss.

Operative Intervention REVASCULARIZATION While carefully designed conservative therapy can benefit many patients with critical limb ischemia, the severe nature of their disease may lead to consideration of operative intervention. Surgical interventions include revascularization or amputation. If the patient wants to undergo revascularization and is an acceptable operative candidate, arteriography is often performed for further evaluation and planning of revascularization. At some centers, magnetic resonance angiography is used as an alternative or supplement to arteriography to minimize the risk of dye exposure. Angioplasty or stent placement, or both, is most successful with short, proximal lesions, such as those in patients with claudication, but is unlikely to be the only treatment necessary in the setting of critical limb ischemia because of the multilevel nature of the arterial occlusive disease.

### Critical evaluation of endovascular surgery for limb salvage [^ee1a55c9]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Rest pain, tissue loss, and gangrene are manifestations of critical limb ischemia caused by peripheral arterial disease and define a patient subgroup at highest risk for major limb amputation. Patients with nonhealing lower extremity wounds should be screened for the risk factors for peripheral arterial disease and offered noninvasive vascular testing. The diagnosis of critical limb ischemia mandates prompt institution of medical and surgical management to achieve the best chance of limb salvage. Surgical intervention has evolved from primary amputation to open bypass to the present era of endovascular therapy. The goals of surgical bypass and endovascular therapy are to improve perfusion sufficiently to permit healing. Despite poorer patency rates and the more frequent need for reintervention, endovascular therapy has been shown in multiple retrospective studies to achieve limb salvage similar to open bypass. Only one large, prospective, randomized controlled trial exists comparing open bypass with endovascular therapy: The Bypass versus Angioplasty in Severe Limb Ischemia of the Leg (BASIL) trial. Close clinical surveillance and serial monitoring of limb perfusion by means of noninvasive arterial studies are needed to determine the need for further vascular intervention. Limb salvage patients suffer from multiple comorbidities and benefit from a multidisciplinary, team approach to care.

- incapacitating pain, non-healing wounds, or uncontrolled sepsis in the affected limb

- further revascularization is not possible.

Limitations

The pragmatic design of the BEST‐CLI trial accommodates the spectrum of revascularization techniques in current use by participating specialists. In so doing, it optimizes investigator engagement and subject enrollment and maximizes the generalizability and long‐term relevance of the trial. Inclusion of such a broad array of open and endovascular therapies, however, introduces significant heterogeneity into the data set and may limit the ability to ascertain the relative effectiveness of specific treatment techniques. The generalizability of the trial could also be compromised if practice patterns during the trial do not mimic those outside of trial conditions. Additionally, although certain strata have been prespecified according to anticipated differences in outcome, additional factors may prove to be equally or more relevant and the statistical power may be insufficient to detect the importance of such parameters.

Acute limb ischemia (ALI) is relatively uncommon but serious condition. The estimated incidence is 23.3/100.000 person years (Baril et al.) (Korabathina et al.). Regardless of any intervention, ALI is linked with significant morbidity and mortality rates. The hospital mortality ranges from 6.3–9% with hospital amputation rate of 6%, and one-year amputation rate 11%, while the one-year mortality could reach up to 41%.

ESVS has published guidelines regarding the management of this critical condition (Björck M et al.). The guidelines have adopted the grading system of recommendation strength proposed by the European Society of Cardiology. In essence, the evidence behind each recommendation is given A-C level, where A represents data derived from multiple randomised clinical trials or meta-analyses, B data derived from a single randomised clinical trial or large nonrandomised studies and C consensus of opinion of the experts and/or small studies, retrospective studies and registries. The strength of each recommendation is given I to III class level where class I represents evidence and/or general agreement that a given treatment or procedure is beneficial, useful, and effective, Class II conflicting evidence and/or a divergence of opinion about the usefulness/efficacy of the given treatment or procedure, and Class III evidence or general agreement that the given treatment or procedure is not useful/effective, and in some cases may be harmful.

Statistical Considerations

BEST‐CLI is designed as 2 separate concurrent trials (in Cohort 1 and in Cohort 2). There is no intent to pool the data between Cohorts, or to test whether the treatment group effects (if any) are similar between the 2 Cohorts. To avoid bias, particularly given that the BEST‐CLI trial by its nature cannot be a blinded study, all analyses will be on the basis of intention‐to‐treat unless otherwise specified. Per intention‐to‐treat, all participants will be analyzed in the Cohorts in which they were classified at the time of randomization, and all participants will be analyzed in the treatment groups to which they were randomly assigned, even if the other type of revascularization strategy was carried out instead or they did not undergo any revascularization procedure within the 30‐day window following randomization. There will also be an exploratory per‐protocol analysis, including only subjects who adhered to their randomly assigned treatment strategy. However, this analysis will be subject to bias, as the subjects who do not undergo their assigned procedure are unlikely to be a representative sample of all subjects assigned to that procedure. For each outcome, the null hypothesis is that there is no difference in that outcome between the 2 treatment groups. The alternative hypothesis is that there is a difference, in either direction, between the treatment groups; ie, the statistical tests will be 2‐sided.

In each cohort, the primary analysis of the primary outcome will be a Cox regression model of time to major revascularization of the index limb, above‐ankle amputation of the index limb, or death from any cause, whichever occurs first. Participants who do not experience a primary outcome event will be considered censored on the last date of study contact. The Cox model will be stratified by randomization stratum, which allows the baseline hazard function to differ between the 4 randomization strata, but assumes a common hazard ratio between endovascular versus open revascularization in all 4 strata. The Cox model will also be adjusted for the following prespecified list of baseline covariates, all of which are expected to be strong predictors of the primary outcome: end‐stage renal disease, diabetes mellitus, prior revascularization of the index leg, and smoking history.

### Worth an arm and a leg: the critical importance of limb ischemia [^61bd9174]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Critical limb ischemia (CLI) represents the final stages of peripheral artery disease, reflecting impairment in tissue perfusion that leads to a threatened limb. The clinical manifestations of this condition may be broad, ranging from rest pain to severe ischemic ulceration or tissue gangrene of the extremities. Unfortunately, this condition is relatively common, with an annual incidence of 3.5 patients per 1000 and a documented age‐adjusted prevalence of 1.3% in the United States. 1 More concerning, the incidence of this condition will likely grow because up to 10% of patients with peripheral artery disease are expected to develop CLI over a 5‐year period. 2 The primary therapeutic intervention for this condition focuses on urgent revascularization to facilitate tissue salvage, through percutaneous or surgical approaches. The immediate limb salvage rates with revascularization are encouraging, although subsequent morbidity and mortality remain high, with more than one third of these patients experiencing a major adverse cardiovascular event within 3 years of their initial presentation. 3 The need for urgent revascularization during the index presentation and the subsequent risk of adverse events make the treatment of CLI incredibly costly to patients and the healthcare system as a whole. 4, 5

### Chronic subcritical limb ischemia: a poorly recognized stage of critical limb ischemia [^d06ba305]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

It is well-known that critical limb ischemia is associated with high mortality and amputation risk. Chronic subcritical limb ischemia, however, represents a subgroup of patients with critical limb ischemia in whom severely reduced circulation to the foot does not manifest as rest pain, ischemic ulceration, or ischemic gangrene. Admittedly, there is a paucity of data describing the fate of this patient subset, and little evidence to support appropriate treatment. To better understand the distinctive characteristics and clinical outcomes of this population, a cohort of 20 patients was examined. During the mean follow-up of 1.9 years, there were no deaths or major amputations, and only one patient progressed to surgical intervention. This review describes the characteristics and outcomes of this patient cohort and discusses the clinical implications. These findings suggest that attentive medical care and risk-reduction strategies may reduce mortality and alter progression of limb ischemia to amputation in patients with chronic subcritical limb ischemia.

### Design and rationale of the best endovascular versus best surgical therapy for patients with critical limb ischemia (BEST-CLI) trial [^3d39724e]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Results and Discussion

The BEST‐CLI trial aims to provide Level I evidence that will significantly enhance therapeutic decision‐making and help establish a much‐needed standard of care for patients with CLI. Recent data from the SVS Vascular Quality Initiative highlight the remarkably high degree of equipoise currently associated with the treatment of CLI in North America (Figure 1). 21 The widely disparate and often tightly held treatment biases regarding the relative role of open surgical and endovascular therapy for CLI serve as the central rationale and ongoing motivation for a trial such as BEST‐CLI.

Several unique features of the BEST‐CLI trial bear further mention, among them the trial design, comprehensive cost‐effectiveness and quality of life analyses, use of novel end points, and collaborative approach. The trial focuses on patients with CLI who are candidates for both infrainguinal open surgical and endovascular revascularization and was purposely designed as a pragmatic trial. The most significant feature of such a design is that the definition of what constitutes "best" therapy within the assigned revascularization approach is left to each individual investigator. Accordingly, all commercially available endovascular therapies (with the exception of cryoplasty) are allowed, as are all surgical bypass techniques and types of conduit. This pragmatic element is of particular importance in the effort to avoid the common pitfall of conducting a trial that is of limited relevance to current clinical practice by the time of final analysis. 42

Conclusions

CLI continues to represent a formidable healthcare challenge. Over and above its major impact on the morbidity, mortality, and QoL of a growing number of patients with PAD, the associated financial burden on our healthcare economy is substantial and growing. The BEST‐CLI trial is a timely and much‐needed study that will help to define best practice and provide a foundation for thoughtful application of current and future treatment options.

### Multidisciplinary care for critical limb ischemia: current gaps and opportunities for improvement [^5638aebd]. Journal of Endovascular Therapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Critical limb ischemia (CLI), defined as ischemic rest pain or nonhealing ulceration due to arterial insufficiency, represents the most severe and limb-threatening manifestation of peripheral artery disease. A major challenge in the optimal treatment of CLI is that multiple specialties participate in the care of this complex patient population. As a result, the care of patients with CLI is often fragmented, and multidisciplinary societal guidelines have not focused specifically on the care of patients with CLI. Furthermore, multidisciplinary care has the potential to improve patient outcomes, as no single medical specialty addresses all the facets of care necessary to reduce cardiovascular and limb-related morbidity in this complex patient population. This review identifies current gaps in the multidisciplinary care of patients with CLI, with a goal toward increasing disease recognition and timely referral, defining important components of CLI treatment teams, establishing options for revascularization strategies, and identifying best practices for wound care post-revascularization.

### Design and rationale of the best endovascular versus best surgical therapy for patients with critical limb ischemia (BEST-CLI) trial [^dd9a267e]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Over the last 2 decades, the widespread adoption of endovascular techniques has led to a sharp increase in their application to patients with CLI 11, 12 and there are numerous reports of excellent limb salvages rates. 13, 14 In comparison to surgical bypass, endovascular therapy is associated with decreased periprocedural morbidity and mortality. However, questions about durability, cost, and appropriate case selection have not been rigorously answered. 15, 16

At present, a variety of practitioners, including interventional cardiologists, vascular medicine specialists, interventional radiologists, and vascular surgeons, provide treatment for CLI. 17 The decision to recommend surgical or endovascular revascularization varies significantly among providers and institutions and appears to be based on such factors as disease pattern, the availability of autogenous conduit, physician training and experience, surgical and endovascular skill sets, access to an appropriate procedural environment, and perhaps most importantly, treatment bias. 15, 18, 19, 20 This lack of treatment uniformity is highlighted by the marked degree to which the primary treatment of CLI varies within the Society of Vascular Surgery (SVS) Vascular Quality Initiative, as illustrated in Figure 1. 21 There is general agreement that some patients considered poor candidates for surgery benefit from endovascular revascularization. 22, 23 What remains unknown is which therapy is most appropriate for patients who are candidates for both open and endovascular treatment. This uncertainty also has economic implications, potentially leading to suboptimal allocation of valuable healthcare resources. 15

Prevention of progression to critical limb ischemia — surgical procedures should not be performed in patients with peripheral artery disease solely to prevent progression to critical limb ischemia. Claudication does not commonly progress to critical limb ischemia, with reported rates of amputation or progression to critical limb ischemia from prospective cohort studies of patients with claudication are < 10% to 15% for 5 years or more. Surgical intervention should not be performed primarily to prevent disease progression, and there are no data to support surgical revascularization in patients with asymptomatic peripheral artery disease to prevent progression to critical limb ischemia.

Study designs and trial end points in chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI) state: Use a research framework such as the IDEAL for gathering new data and evidence on the surgical and endovascular management of CLTI. Encourage funders, journal reviewers, and editors to prioritize prospective, multicenter, controlled, and preferably randomized studies over retrospective case series, studies using historical controls, or other less rigorous research methodologies. When RCTs are not feasible, use the OPG benchmarks from the SVS's Critical Limb Ischemia Working Group to evaluate the efficacy of novel endovascular CLTI techniques and devices. To facilitate sufficient enrollment, limit RCT exclusion criteria to those who are deemed essential to trial integrity. Design RCTs, prospective cohort studies, and registries that are specific to CLTI. Use an integrated, limb-based threatened limb classification system (eg, WIfI) and a whole limb anatomic classification scheme (eg, GLASS) to describe the characteristics and outcomes of CLTI patients who are enrolled. Describe outcomes in CLTI trials using a combination of objective and clinically relevant events, subjective PROMs and HRQL assessments, and anatomic and hemodynamic end points. Require regulatory trials aimed at obtaining premarket approval for devices for use in CLTI to study CLTI patients and to present data on objective and clinically relevant end points, PROMs and HRQL assessments, and anatomic and hemodynamic end points. Follow up patients in trials for a time sufficient (this will usually be > 2 years) to allow appropriate comparison of the impact of the different interventions on the natural history of CLTI, and measure and declare completeness of follow-up coverage to quantify risk of attrition bias. Include a time-integrated measure of clinical disease severity (such as freedom from CLTI) in the CLTI trial design to describe the total impact of comparator CLTI interventions. Publish all CLTI trial protocols together with the full statistical analysis plans in peer-reviewed journals to allow independent, public, and transparent scrutiny and to prevent nonreporting of negative trials. Conduct postmarketing surveillance data collection using well-designed, large observational studies and registries.

### Comparing the efficacy and safety of endovascular therapy versus surgical revascularization for critical limb-threatening ischemia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^7c79161d]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Critical limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI) is a severe manifestation of peripheral artery disease (PAD) that can lead to limb amputation and significantly reduce quality of life. In addition to guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT), endovascular therapy and surgical revascularization are the two revascularization options for CLTI. In recent years, there has been an ongoing debate about the best approach for CLTI patients. The purpose of this meta-analysis is to examine the current evidence and compare the clinical outcomes of endovascular therapy and surgical revascularization for CLTI.

Methods

We conducted a systematic search of electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science) for studies comparing the outcomes of endovascular therapy versus surgery in patients with CLTI. The primary outcomes were major adverse limb events (MALE) and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), while secondary outcomes included risk of bleeding, wound complications, readmission, unplanned reoperation, acute renal failure, and length of hospital stay. Pooled data was analyzed using the fixed-effect model or the random-effect model in Review Manager 5.3. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and Cochrane risk of bias assessment tool were used to assess the bias of included studies.

Results

A total of 16 studies (47,609 patients) were included in this meta-analysis. The overall effect favors surgery over endovascular intervention in terms of MALE [odds ratio (OR) 1.13, 95% CI (1.01–1.28), P = 0.04]. Endovascular therapy is associated with lower MACE rates compared to surgery [OR 0.62, 95% CI (0.51–0.76), P < 0.00001]. Furthermore, the risk of bleeding, wound complications, readmission, unplanned reoperation, acute renal failure as well as the length of hospital stay was lower for endovascular intervention. Finally, there was no statistically significant difference in 30-day mortality between the two groups [OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.79–1.12, P = 0.52; Fig. 3i], and the pooled studies were homogeneous [P = 0.39; I2 = 5%].

Conclusion

Surgery may be the preferred treatment option for CLTI patients, as it is associated with a lower risk of MALE than endovascular therapy. However, endovascular therapy may be associated with a lower risk of MACE and lower rates of bleeding, wound complications, readmission, unplanned reoperation, acute renal failure, and shorter hospital stays. There was no statistically significant difference in 30-day mortality between the two groups. Ultimately, the decision to use endovascular therapy or surgery as the primary treatment strategy should be based on a multi-disciplinary team approach with careful consideration of patient characteristics and anatomy.

### Determining end points for critical limb ischemia interventions [^50383b21]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

Critical limb ischemia is a condition that has increased in prevalence and carries a high degree of morbidity. Although endovascular therapy for treatment of patients with critical limb ischemia has undergone significant advances with improved outcomes over the past decade, these patients often have multilevel disease, and it may take weeks or months for ulceration healing. For this reason, the acceptable therapeutic end points during and immediately following revascularization remain somewhat obscure. There are multiple tools available to guide the treating vascular specialist in this regard. Establishment of in-line flow to the foot and the angiosome containing the ulceration, appearance of a "wound blush", restoration of pulses, and bleeding at the ulcer site are basic tenets intraprocedurally. Postprocedural noninvasive testing including the ankle-brachial and toe-brachial indices, segmental pressure measurements, pulse volume recordings, transcutaneous oxygen tension, skin perfusion pressures (SPPs), and toe pressures all play a role in determining the likelihood of clinical improvement. Newer technologies such as two-dimensional (2D) perfusion angiography, fluorescence angiography, and tissue oxygen saturation mapping may allow better real-time assessment of flow restoration. In combination with close clinical follow-up and wound care, these tools provide treating physicians with a better grasp of the necessary end points to optimize patients for clinical improvement.

### Quality of life in patients suffering from critical limb ischemia [^24f0a4bd]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Various treatment options exist for patients suffering from critical limb ischemia (CLI). These options consist of endovascular procedures, surgical revascularization, primary amputation, or conservative therapy. The effect of the treatment is traditionally focused on outcomes, such as primary patency and limb salvage, though quality of life (QoL) is considered an important additional primary end point in a more patient-oriented healthcare system. The aim of this systematic review is to explore the best clinical decision making possible, to increase QoL in CLI patients.

Methods

This review is based on a systematic electronic literature search using the PubMed and EMBASE databases. Articles evaluating QoL in patients with CLI were selected for further analysis. Only prospective studies, written in English, describing QoL and health status (HS) after endovascular or surgical revascularization, amputation or conservative therapy were considered for inclusion. Treatment results were divided into short-term (≤ 3-month follow-up) and long-term results (≥ 1-year follow-up) to achieve a clear view of the QoL in patients suffering for CLI patients.

Results

Twenty-five articles describing HS in patients suffering from CLI were included. It was found that while most of these articles reported HS of patients, rarely did they report on QoL. As a result, it is difficult to determine the best treatment to increase HS as studies that focus on the comparison of treatment modalities are lacking. All 4 treatment modalities can raise HS in the short and the long terms; however, endovascular and surgical revascularization seem to positively effect HS the most. QoL results are lacking in both the short and long terms.

Conclusions

All treatment methods included in the study resulted in an increase in patients' HS in both short and long terms. More comparative studies with inclusion of all different treatments of CLI are needed to assist in clinical decision making and perform tailored interventions for the individual patient. QoL and HS are confusingly used in current international literature with abundant HS research. To take patients individual opinions more into account, focus on QoL research is needed to designate the superior treatment in patients suffering from CLI.

### Three-year outcomes of surgical versus endovascular revascularization for critical limb ischemia: the SPINACH study (surgical reconstruction versus peripheral intervention in patients with critical limb ischemia) [^24f82af8]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Interventions (2017). Low credibility.

Critical limb ischemia (CLI) is the most advanced form of peripheral arterial disease characterized by ischemic rest pain and ulcer/gangrene. – Revascularization is positioned as the first-line treatment. Clinical guidelines recommend both surgical reconstruction and endovascular therapy (EVT), largely based on the findings of the BASIL trial (British Angioplasty versus Surgery in Ischemic Legs). Although this classical trial was no doubt an important and informative study, clinical settings have changed during the past decade. For example, technical development has advanced swiftly in the field of EVT. It remains uncertain whether the evidence presented by the trial would be still valid and true in current clinical practice. The aim of this study was to compare clinical outcomes between surgical reconstruction and EVT for CLI in today's real-world settings.

### Global vascular guidelines for patients with critical limb-threatening ischemia [^f19f6e9e]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Global vascular guidelines — evidence-based revascularization planning and procedural selection emphasize that Evidence-Based Revascularization (EBR) depends on Patient risk, Limb severity, and Anatomic complexity (PLAN). The proposed new Global Anatomic Staging System (GLASS) replaces previously used classifications; it defines a preferred target artery path (TAP), estimates limb-based patency (LBP), and establishes stages of complexity for interventions, and GLASS is used to determine the likelihood of limb salvage and the best route to achieve it. Access to perform both invasive treatments, endovascular procedures and open surgery, is required to appropriately treat these patients. Having an autogenous saphenous vein available favors surgical bypass in advanced CLTI, while endovascular interventions are preferred for high-risk patients with less complex anatomy.

### Critical limb ischemia: current trends and future directions [^2916b424]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Critical limb ischemia (CLI), which is at the end of the peripheral artery disease (PAD) spectrum, is associated with excessively high risk for cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, and death. 1, 2, 3 Mortality rates as high as 20% within 6 months from diagnosis and exceeding 50% at 5 years have been reported for CLI, 4, 5, 6 whereas 1‐year mortality rates in nonrevascularizable, so‐called no‐option CLI patients range from 10% to 40%. 7, 8 The high mortality rates exceed those for every other form of occlusive cardiovascular disease, including symptomatic coronary artery disease (CAD), 9, 10 and reflect the systemic atherosclerotic burden associated with CLI. Besides poor survival rates, prognosis with respect to limb preservation in CLI patients is poor, 11 particularly in no‐option CLI patients, where 6‐month major amputation rates have been reported to range from 10% to 40%. 6, 7, 8 Additionally, CLI is associated with poor quality of life 12 and high treatment costs, 13 especially when amputation is inevitable. 13, 14 With an estimated yearly incidence of 500 to 1000 new cases per million individuals in Western society, 7 which is ever increasing in concert with the increase in cardiovascular risk factors, 15, 16, 17 CLI poses a substantial burden on patients, healthcare providers, and resources.

In the current review we will describe how management strategies in CLI have evolved over the past decades and discuss issues that could facilitate more rapid and evidence‐based improvements in CLI management and care. Focus will be on factors that may have limited evidence‐based management and on actions that could promote progress in this field, especially with respect to clinical research.

Contemporary treatment of patients with acute limb ischemia includes both open and endovascular techniques, and advances in technology continue to make interventions easier and safer. However, the greatest gains in improving outcomes in these patients will come from more consistent and prompt recognition of the disease followed by rapid, standardized therapy to minimize the risk of limb loss and subsequent reperfusion-related injury. This article uses case reports to highlight critical issues that may arise during the course of diagnosis and treatment and describes clinical factors associated with morbidity and mortality in these patients.

### Design and rationale of the best endovascular versus best surgical therapy for patients with critical limb ischemia (BEST-CLI) trial [^537eae27]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Recognizing the degree to which CLI is currently managed by a range of subspecialists in the United States and Canada, principally vascular surgeons, interventional cardiologists, interventional radiologists, and vascular medicine specialists, every effort has been made to make the BEST‐CLI trial a fully multidisciplinary endeavor. To have the trial most accurately reflect contemporary practice and, to the extent possible, have the results accepted by the entire spectrum of CLI caregivers, it was felt important to have all those providing CLI care at participating BEST‐CLI trial sites involved. Towards this end, the creation of "CLI teams" has been promoted at each institution. The goals of the CLI team include supporting the enrollment of patients, creating and fostering an environment conducive to constructive communication and physician collaboration, and ensuring standard‐of‐care treatment within the strategy to which each subject has been randomized. A hallmark of the CLI team is the requirement that each patient be reviewed by a minimum of 2 members of the CLI team: 1 credentialed in endovascular treatment and the other credentialed for open surgical revascularization. This same requirement also applies to any randomized subject being considered for reintervention. Further underscoring the collaborative design and intent of the BEST‐CLI trial, the EC, the Clinical Events Classification Committee, the DSMB, and each of the 7 subcommittees detailed above has well‐balanced representation from all participating disciplines. Finally, and as an additional reflection of the efforts to integrate the contributions of all interested parties, the BEST‐CLI trial has received a broad level of support from numerous relevant professional societies and organizations. The trial has been formally endorsed by the SVS, the Society of Interventional Radiology, the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Intervention, the Society of Vascular Medicine, the Vascular Disease Foundation, Vascular InterVentional Advances, and the Food and Drug Administration.

Randomization

The patient flow diagram for the BEST‐CLI trial is depicted in Figure 2. Subjects meeting all of the inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria are randomized within the outlined schema based on the results of a contrast angiogram of sufficient quality performed within the preceding 3 months. Randomization can alternatively be based on a magnetic resonance angiogram or computed tomographic angiogram of sufficient quality performed within the preceding 3 months, with the caveat that the infrapopliteal arteries are free of significant disease. If the infrapopliteal arteries are involved to such a degree that they would require treatment as part of an open or endovascular revascularization, then an additional contrast angiogram is required. If no recent and sufficient contrast angiogram, magnetic resonance angiogram, or computed tomographic angiogram is available, a diagnostic angiogram must be obtained prior to randomization to confirm trial eligibility.

### Determinants of long-term outcomes and costs in the management of critical limb ischemia: a population-based cohort study [^1e5bf9f2]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Critical limb ischemia (CLI) represents the most advanced manifestation of peripheral artery disease and is categorized as ischemic rest pain, nonhealing ischemic ulceration, or gangrene. Patients with CLI often present with multilevel peripheral artery disease that prevents the arterial supply from meeting the metabolic demands of tissue at rest. Prompt revascularization by endovascular or open surgical procedures is indicated following the diagnosis of CLI diagnosis to preserve the limb and maintain limb function. 1 However, management of CLI remains highly controversial, particularly when selecting an initial revascularization strategy. In an analysis of 7900 CLI patients from the Vascular Quality Initiative, 3‐year survival was lower with endovascular versus surgical revascularization strategies (70% versus 78%). 2 In the First‐Line Treatments in Patients With Critical Limb Ischemia (CRITISCH) registry of 1200 CLI patients, there was no difference in 1‐year mortality or major amputation between revascularization methods. 3 The randomized BASIL (Bypass versus Angioplasty in Severe Ischaemia of the Leg) study also found no differences in long‐term mortality or major amputation when comparing endovascular versus surgical revascularization. 4 Although primary major amputation for CLI is associated with impaired mobility, high cost, high risk of contralateral limb amputation, and poor prognosis, 5, 6 this procedure may be indicated in some patients with cognitive impairment, nonambulatory status, extensive comorbidities, extensive gangrene, or infection. 7 Overall, the optimal treatment for CLI and determinants of long‐term results remain controversial, and the total costs of care are unclear to the vascular specialist. The purpose of this study was to report long‐term outcomes and costs following initial CLI diagnosis, with comparisons among endovascular revascularization, surgical revascularization, or major amputation as first‐line treatment among a contemporaneous cohort of Medicare beneficiaries.

### Management of critical limb ischemia [^be9a5d15]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Interventions (2016). Low credibility.

Critical limb ischemia (CLI) is a clinical syndrome of ischemic pain at rest or tissue loss, such as nonhealing ulcers or gangrene, related to peripheral artery disease. CLI has a high short-term risk of limb loss and cardiovascular events. Noninvasive or invasive angiography help determine the feasibility and approach to arterial revascularization. An endovascular-first approach is often advocated based on a lower procedural risk; however, specific patterns of disease may be best treated by open surgical revascularization. Balloon angioplasty and stenting form the backbone of endovascular techniques, with drug-eluting stents and drug-coated balloons offering low rates of repeat revascularization. Combined antegrade and retrograde approaches can increase success in long total occlusions. Below the knee, angiosome-directed angioplasty may lead to greater wound healing, but failing this, any straight-line flow into the foot is pursued. Hybrid surgical techniques such as iliac stenting and common femoral endarterectomy are commonly used to reduce operative risk. Lower extremity bypass grafting is most successful with a good quality, long, single-segment autogenous vein of at least 3.5-mm diameter. Minor amputations are often required for tissue loss as a part of the treatment strategy. Major amputations (at or above the ankle) limit functional independence, and their prevention is a key goal of CLI therapy. Medical therapy after revascularization targets risk factors for atherosclerosis and assesses wound healing and new or recurrent flow-limiting disease. The ongoing National Institutes of Health-sponsored Best Endovascular Versus Best Surgical Therapy in Patients With Critical Limb Ischemia (BEST-CLI) study is a randomized trial of the contemporary endovascular versus open surgical techniques in patients with CLI.

### Critical limb ischemia: endovascular strategies for limb salvage [^b8dba530]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Critical limb ischemia (CLI) represents the most severe clinical manifestation of peripheral arterial disease, defined as the presence of chronic ischemic rest pain, ulcers, or gangrene attributable to objectively proven arterial occlusive disease. The dominant pathology underlying CLI is atherosclerosis, distributed at multiple levels along the length of the lower extremity and with a propensity for involvement of the tibial vessels in the leg and the small vessels of the foot. To achieve limb salvage in patients with CLI, revascularization of the affected limb is generally required. In contemporary practice, endovascular techniques are rapidly replacing surgical bypass as the first option for revascularization for CLI based on high technical success rates and low rates of procedure-related morbidity and mortality. This review will describe the clinical strategy of the authors who have adopted an endovascular-first approach to revascularization in treating patients with CLI and summarize the clinical outcomes of endovascular therapy in this population.

Materials and Methods

Study Plan and Patient Population

The BEST‐CLI Trial is a prospective, randomized, open label, 2‐arm, multicenter, multidisciplinary, controlled, superiority trial designed to compare treatment efficacy, functional outcomes, QoL, and cost in patients undergoing best endovascular or best open surgical revascularization for CLI. The choice of best therapy within the assigned treatment approach is left to the individual investigator. The planned enrollment is 2100 patients from ≈140 sites in the United States and Canada. Each site must have at least 1 investigator meeting BEST‐CLI credentialing criteria to perform open surgery, and at least 1 investigator meeting BEST‐CLI credentialing criteria to perform endovascular treatment. The BEST‐CLI trial began enrolling patients in August 2014 and has a planned total study duration of 50 months.

The trial encompasses 2 independently powered randomized cohorts. The first cohort (1620 subjects) consists of patients who are believed to have adequate single‐segment great saphenous vein available as a conduit for bypass; the second cohort (480 subjects) includes patients who do not have an adequate single‐segment great saphenous vein. Patients in the latter cohort who are randomized to surgical revascularization will be treated with surgical bypass using an arm vein, short saphenous vein, cryopreserved vein, prosthetic conduit, or composite conduit. Within each cohort, randomization will be stratified according to (1) clinical presentation, defined by presence of ischemic rest pain alone (Rutherford 4) versus tissue loss (Rutherford 5 and 6) with or without ischemic rest pain and (2) anatomic status, defined by the presence or absence of significant tibial disease. Randomization is accomplished using computer‐generated permuted blocks within each of the 8 combinations of cohort and stratum.

### Critical limb ischemia: current trends and future directions [^5de7dafe]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

It is encouraging that the importance of developments and high‐quality evidence in severe limb ischemia seems to get more attention in recent years, which is reflected by 3 important RCTs in both the United States and Europe, the BEST‐CLI and BASIL‐2 and ‐3 trials, respectively. In short, the BEST‐CLI (: NCT02060630), Best Endovascular versus Best Surgical Therapy in patients with CLI, trial is a pragmatic, multicenter, open label, randomized trial in 2100 subjects in 120 sites in North America that compares best endovascular versus best surgical therapy in CLI patients eligible for both treatments. 84 Subjects will be stratified in Rutherford 4 versus Rutherford 5 or 6 patients, which likely influences outcome substantially. The trial is funded by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute of the National Institutes of Health by a $24.9 million grant. BASIL‐2 (ISRTCN.com: ISRTCN27728689), Bypass versus Angioplasty in Severe Ischemia of the Leg‐2, funded by the National Health Service (NHS), investigates venous bypass first versus best endovascular first strategy in 600 patients with severe limb ischemia due to infrapopliteal atherosclerotic disease in a 1:1 randomized fashion, while BASIL‐3 (not yet initiated) will be a 3‐armed trial that will compare plain balloon angioplasty, drug‐eluting balloon, and drug‐eluting stents in severe limb ischemia patients due to femoropopliteal lesions. These trials will also include several of the recently defined Objective Performance Goals as outcome measures. 11 These large and ambitious trials will provide very essential information on characteristics and prognosis of severe limb ischemia and more current evidence to guide therapy for this challenging pathology.

### FDA perspective on objective performance goals and clinical trial design for evaluating catheter-based treatment of critical limb ischemia [^8867846d]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

The article by Conte et al.(1) on behalf of the Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS) in this issue of the Journal of Vascular Surgery provides guidelines for improving the consistency and interpretability of clinical trials intended to evaluate treatment options for patients with critical limb ischemia (CLI). This article identifies a number of key challenges with conducting and comparing CLI trials, including the wide spectrum of clinical presentations that CLI encompasses, the use of disparate eligibility criteria and endpoint measurements, and logistical and economic considerations that can limit study initiation and completion. The authors propose definitions for a number of performance goals derived from historical surgical literature as a means of reducing the negative impact of these factors. The current editorial reviews aspects of this proposal from the perspective of the authors in terms of their understanding of the statutory obligations of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to regulate the marketing of cardiovascular devices based on valid scientific evidence.

Surgery for critical limb ischemia (CLI) — sequencing, amputation evaluation, and when not to intervene — includes: CLASS I For individuals with combined inflow and outflow disease with CLI, inflow lesions should be addressed first (Level of Evidence: B); CLASS I For individuals with combined inflow and outflow disease in whom symptoms of CLI or infection persist after inflow revascularization, an outflow revascularization procedure should be performed (Level of Evidence: B); CLASS I Patients who have significant necrosis of the weight-bearing portions of the foot (in ambulatory patients), an uncorrectable flexion contracture, paresis of the extremity, refractory ischemic rest pain, sepsis, or a very limited life expectancy due to comorbid conditions should be evaluated for primary amputation of the leg (Level of Evidence: C); and CLASS III Surgical and endovascular intervention is not indicated in patients with severe decrements in limb perfusion (e.g. ABI < 0.4) in the absence of clinical symptoms of CLI (Level of Evidence: C).

### Acute limb ischemia [^8d27dd46]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2009). Low credibility.

Acute limb ischemia occurs when there is an abrupt interruption of blood flow to an extremity usually because of either embolic or thrombotic vascular occlusion. When profound ischemia ensues, this represents an emergency in which restoration of perfusion through early intervention can lead to limb salvage, whereas delay may result in significant morbidity, including limb loss and, potentially, death. Patients in whom urgent or semi-urgent surgical or endovascular revascularization is indicated may undergo catheter angiography unless there is a contraindication, such as profound critical limb ischemia, renal dysfunction, or contrast allergy. Alternative imaging modalities include ultrasound, contrast-enhanced computed tomographic angiography, and magnetic resonance angiography. The clinical degree of the ischemic insult will determine the most appropriate course of management, as severely ischemic limbs may require immediate surgical revascularization, while endovascular interventions, such as catheter-directed thrombolysis, may be appropriate in patients with moderate ischemia. Additionally, many percutaneous mechanical thrombectomy devices are being used or undergoing clinical evaluation, either alone or in combination with pharmacologic thrombolysis, for the treatment of acute limb-threatening ischemia. In this article, we present our approach to an acutely ischemic limb, with a focus on the pertinent aspects of endovascular intervention.

### Critical limb ischemia-need to look beyond limb salvage [^acc0e3b0]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Revascularization is the optimal treatment for critical limb ischemia (CLI). Traditional measures of outcome of intervention are as follows: graft patency, limb salvage rates, and patient survival rates; however, these have little meaning for a patient if he/she cannot ambulate independently or go back to work. This study was undertaken to assess the functional outcome of intervention in these patients.

Methods

Fifty patients with CLI treated over a 3-year period were included in this prospective clinical study. After evaluation, treatment was given to each patient on the basis of the Transatlantic Inter-society Consensus II guidelines. The outcome of treatment and the functional restoration to pre-illness lifestyle were assessed at the end of 1 month, and then at 6 months.

Results

Fifty patients with CLI were included in the study; male to female ratio was 9:1, and the mean age at presentation was 45 years. After evaluation, only 38 patients (76%) were found suitable for revascularization. Traditional measures of success showed a graft patency rate of 75%, limb salvage rate of 89.5%, and patient survival rate of 96% at 6 months after treatment. All eight parameters of quality-of-life analysis showed significant improvement as assessed by the Research and Development (RAND) 36-Item Health Survey 1.0 form. However, among the 38 patients who were revascularized, 20 (52.6%) went back to their initial occupation after 6 months, 12 (31.6%) remained at home even though they were ambulant, and five (13.2%) were able to manage only limited activities; one patient succumbed to death.

Conclusion

With only 53% of revascularized patients returning to work, a salvaged leg does not equate with return to premorbid ambulatory/occupational status, although there might be improvement in quality of life because of other reasons. As surgeons, we need to look beyond leg salvage and graft patency and take on a more holistic approach.

### Always contact a vascular interventional specialist before amputating a patient with critical limb ischemia [^4a6c1882]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

Critical limb ischemia (CLI) is a manifestation of severe peripheral arterial disease, characterized by pain at rest, nonhealing ulcers, or both. Revascularization is necessary to save the limb and this can be performed surgically or percutaneously. When both treatments are possible, endovascular therapy is preferred because of similar clinical outcomes and lower costs.

Percutaneous angioplasty of the infrapopliteal arteries has long been regarded as a difficult procedure because of the small caliber of the tibial arteries and the tendency to develop spasm. Over the years experience with percutaneous treatment of infrapopliteal disease has grown, with promising technical and clinical results. While short occlusions can be treated percutaneously, most long occlusions still require a surgical approach. Subintimal angioplasty (SA) is a percutaneous alternative to surgery to overcome long occlusions, when a transluminal approach would be technically impossible. Although SA of tibial arteries can result in high limb salvage rates, most studies do not differentiate between severe and mild ischemia and do not state whether a surgical option was still available. As a result, such mixed patient groups show higher limb salvage rates compared with patients with CLI without a surgical option for revascularization.

Patients with end-stage CLI with long and multiple tibial artery occlusions, without options for surgical revascularization, often end up with an amputation. In such patients, infrapopliteal SA could be an interesting treatment and a last chance to save the patient's limb. This 'percutaneous temporary pedal bypass' was described previously.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether tibial artery SA in end-stage CLI patients without surgical options an amputation. As a secondary objective of the study, we evaluated the influence of outflow on clinical success.

### Chapter VI: follow-up after revascularisation [^acc85ad1]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Structured follow-up after revascularisation for chronic critical limb ischaemia (CLI) aims at sustained treatment success and continued best patient care. Thereby, efforts need to address three fundamental domains: (A) best medical therapy, both to protect the arterial reconstruction locally and to reduce atherosclerotic burden systemically; (B) surveillance of the arterial reconstruction; and (C) timely initiation of repeat interventions. As most CLI patients are elderly and frail, sustained resolution of CLI and preserved ambulatory capacity may decide over independent living and overall prognosis. Despite this importance, previous guidelines have largely ignored follow-up after CLI; arguably because of a striking lack of evidence and because of a widespread assumption that, in the context of CLI, efficacy of initial revascularisation will determine prognosis during the short remaining life expectancy. This chapter of the current CLI guidelines aims to challenge this disposition and to recommend evidentially best clinical practice by critically appraising available evidence in all of the above domains, including antiplatelet and antithrombotic therapy, clinical surveillance, use of duplex ultrasound, and indications for and preferred type of repeat interventions for failing and failed reconstructions. However, as corresponding studies are rarely performed among CLI patients specifically, evidence has to be consulted that derives from expanded patient populations. Therefore, most recommendations are based on extrapolations or subgroup analyses, which leads to an almost systematic degradation of their strength. Endovascular reconstruction and surgical bypass are considered separately, as are specific contexts such as diabetes or renal failure; and critical issues are highlighted throughout to inform future studies.

### Percutaneous vascular interventions versus bypass surgeries in patients with critical limb ischemia: a comprehensive meta-analysis [^7d161bf3]. Annals of Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim of our study was to compare percutaneous vascular interventions (PVI) versus bypass surgeries (BSX) in patients with critical limb ischemia (CLI).

Background

Previous relevant reviews with limited numbers of included studies did not strictly confine the inclusion criteria to CLI, also involving patients with severe claudication, which may introduce bias in the decision-making of CLI revascularization. Current treatment strategies for CLI still remain controversial.

Methods

We performed a meta-analysis of all available randomized controlled trials and observational clinical studies comparing PVI with BSX in CLI patients. Primary endpoints included overall survival, amputation-free survival, 30-day mortality, and major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events.

Results

We identified 45 cohorts and 1 RCT in over 20,903 patients. In overall population, PVI reduced the risks of 30-day mortality [odds ratio (OR) 0.69, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.51–0.95), major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (OR 0.42, 95% CI 0.29–0.61), and surgical site infection (OR 0.31, 95% CI 0.19–0.51), but increased the risks of long-term all-cause mortality [hazard ratio (HR) 1.16, 95% CI 1.05–1.27) and primary patency failure (HR 1.31, 95% CI 1.08–1.58). When compared with autogenous BSX, PVI was also associated with additional increased risks of long-term death or amputation (HR 1.41, 95% CI 1.02–1.94) and secondary patency failure (HR 1.51, 95% CI 1.17–1.95). In patients with infrapopliteal lesions, we found PVI had inferior primary patency (HR 1.39, 95% CI 1.10–1.75) compared with BSX.

Conclusion

For patients in good physical condition with long life-expectancy, BSX may represent a better choice compared with PVI, particularly when autogenous bypass is available. While enhanced perioperative care for cardiovascular events and surgical site should be considered in patients underwent BSX to achieve comparable short-term outcomes provided by PVI.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

2018 AUC for Peripheral Artery Intervention — lower-extremity peripheral artery disease (PAD) guidance states that, with the exception of claudication that imposes lifestyle- or vocation-limiting symptoms, revascularization for intermittent claudication is only Appropriate after a trial of guideline-directed medical therapy and exercise; surgical revascularization remains a reasonable option when anatomical or clinical features make endovascular therapy less effective. For patients with critical limb ischemia (CLI), the importance of early revascularization is critical to limb salvage, while asymptomatic PAD rarely warrants revascularization, though percutaneous cardiac support devices and valve replacement therapies may require arterial interventions to facilitate vascular access.

### Design and rationale of the best endovascular versus best surgical therapy for patients with critical limb ischemia (BEST-CLI) trial [^f2ddb3cd]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Peripheral artery disease (PAD) affects 3% to 10% of all Americans and 15% to 20% of persons 70 years of age and older. PAD is particularly common among individuals who smoke or have diabetes mellitus. 1, 2 A subset of patients with PAD have critical limb ischemia (CLI), which is characterized by varying degrees of foot or ankle pain at rest and/or the presence of ischemic ulcerations or necrotic tissue. The incidence of CLI in the United States is estimated to be between 500 and 1000 per million per year. Given the aging of the American population, the global increase in metabolic syndrome, and the ongoing impact of diabetes mellitus and tobacco use, the prevalence of both PAD and CLI is predicted to further increase. 1 In addition, management of CLI has substantial healthcare and societal costs, 3, 4 and these are expected to grow given current demographic, disease, and economic trends. 1

CLI is associated with significant disability, morbidity, and mortality. In the absence of successful revascularization, 20% to 40% of patients will require amputation and over 20% will die within 6 months. 1, 2, 5 In a recently published large German registry, CLI with tissue loss was associated with 4‐year amputation rates of 35% to 67% and mortality rates ranging from 52% to 64%. 6

Because of the absence of medical therapy effective for salvage of threatened legs, CLI is typically treated with revascularization to improve limb perfusion distal to the zone of arterial stenosis or occlusion. Open surgical bypass has historically been the standard of care for patients with infrainguinal PAD and is associated with excellent limb salvage rates and clinical durability. 7 Outcomes of surgical bypass are significantly affected by the quality of the conduit utilized, 8, 9 the severity of ischemia at presentation, 10 and the extent of infrainguinal arterial obstruction. 10

Study Procedures and Follow‐Up

For BEST‐CLI trial subjects with associated aortoiliac occlusive disease, concomitant treatment of the aortoiliac disease at the time of the index infrainguinal revascularization is allowed for patients with ischemic tissue loss. Patients presenting with ischemic rest pain as their sole manifestation of CLI, in contrast, must first undergo treatment of the aortoiliac segment to correct the suprainguinal inflow. Randomization of such subjects is subsequently allowed if they have persistent rest pain symptoms and continue to meet the hemodynamic definition of CLI on repeat assessment.

Since the BEST‐CLI trial aims to compare endovascular versus open approaches, hybrid procedures combining elements of both endovascular and open surgical treatment of infrainguinal disease were initially prohibited. Following modifications to the BEST‐CLI trial protocol approved by the DSMB in August 2015 (Table 1), investigators are allowed to combine surgical endarterectomy of the common femoral artery with postrandomization endovascular treatment of more distal disease. For patients with rest pain who undergo either open surgical or endovascular treatment of common femoral disease, a similar requirement to confirm persistence of rest pain symptoms and continued hemodynamic criteria of CLI after treatment of the common femoral artery and prior to randomization into the trial remains in place.

Although discouraged, unplanned staged revascularization following randomization to endovascular treatment is allowed if considered necessary (eg, in the event of patient intolerance of conscious sedation, concern for contrast dye load or radiation exposure) for up to 4 days following the initial endovascular effort, provided that the initial treatment rendered is well documented and the treatment plan for the subsequent stage is clearly delineated. Retreatment of lesions treated in the initial stage will be considered reinterventions or treatment failures.

The outline of postrevascularization follow‐up visits and the parameters to be measured is listed in Table 4.

The trial is being conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki ethical standards 30 and with adherence to the rules and regulations of the Institutional Review Board at each participating institution. All subjects are required to provide written informed consent using an Institutional Review Board–approved consent form. Research reported in this publication is supported by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) of the National Institutes of Health under Award Numbers U01HL107352, U01HL107407, and U01HL115662 (NCT02060630). The content is solely the responsibility of the authors and does not necessarily represent the official views of the National Institutes of Health. An Investigational Device Exemption was granted by the Food and Drug Administration to allow investigator use of Food and Drug Administration–approved devices in an off‐label fashion consistent with routine practice and current standards of care.

Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria

Patients appropriate for the BEST‐CLI trial must satisfy all of the inclusion and exclusion criteria and be considered suitable candidates for both endovascular and open surgical revascularization by at least 2 investigators at the participating trial site. At least 1 of the 2 investigators must be credentialed to perform endovascular revascularization and the other must be credentialed to perform open surgical bypass. One year after initiation of the trial, several modifications to the inclusion and exclusion criteria were approved by the Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB). The changes incorporated investigator feedback and served either to clarify confusing elements of the criteria or to enhance enrollment while preserving the core objectives and aims of the trial. Table 1 compares the original and modified inclusion and exclusion criteria. Enrolled patients must have adequate aortoiliac inflow, as defined in Table 2, and appropriate proximal and distal anastomotic targets for a surgical bypass. The definition of CLI 10 is listed in Table 3.

The lack of consensus underlying the current therapeutic approach to CLI directly stems from insufficient high‐quality data upon which to base treatment decisions. Although there are many studies evaluating management strategies for CLI, most have limitations arising from their use of retrospective data with incomplete control for potential confounders, sponsor and operator bias, inclusion of claudicants, and short or incomplete follow‐up. 24, 25 To date, there is only 1 prospective randomized trial comparing endovascular techniques with surgical revascularization for limb ischemia, the Bypass versus Angioplasty in Severe Ischaemia of the Leg (BASIL) trial. 26, 27 Endovascular treatment in BASIL was limited to percutaneous transluminal angioplasty alone, as was standard practice in the United Kingdom where the trial was undertaken; as such, the applicability of the trial result to current practice in North America, which typically includes the use of stents, atherectomy, and drug‐coated balloons, has been questioned. 15, 16 The choice of amputation‐free survival (AFS) as the primary end point in the BASIL trial has also been criticized, as it overemphasizes non‐treatment‐related mortality and underemphasizes limb‐related events specifically attributable to treatment modality. 15

The BEST‐CLI (B est E ndovascular versus Best S urgical T herapy in patients with C ritical L imb I schemia) trial was conceived to provide level I comparative‐effectiveness evidence to help guide treatment decisions in the management of CLI. 28, 29 The trial will furnish contemporary information about therapeutic outcomes in patients with CLI who are candidates for either surgical bypass or endovascular therapy. It will also provide high‐quality cost‐effectiveness data about surgical and endovascular approaches to treating CLI, and the impact of those treatments on the quality of life (QoL) and overall function of the study population.

### American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons clinical practice guideline summary for limb salvage or early amputation [^90497c91]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2021). High credibility.

Vascular injury/limb ischemia — decision-making and immediate management: The evidence suggests that neither hard signs of vascular injury nor duration of limb ischemia are absolute factors in the decision for limb salvage vs. amputation, but the panel recognizes that prolonged ischemia is detrimental and the interval to reperfusion should be kept to a practical minimum, and the duration of lower extremity ischemia is directly correlated with adverse events. Strength of Recommendation: Limited. The panel recommends that steps be taken to promptly identify arterial injury and limb malperfusion and to limit the duration of extremity ischemia to a practical minimum, and also recommends performance of measures such as extremity fasciotomy and debridement of non-viable tissue to reduce the negative impact of ischemia and reperfusion injury. Attempts at limb salvage should not be continued in extremities that are unable to have perfusion maintained or restored, and both the available evidence and common sense are clear that when unable to restore or preserve limb perfusion, continued limb salvage efforts are inappropriate and ill-advised.

Second, it is important to emphasize that urgent revascularization is imperative to improve outcomes in these patients. Prior data suggest that a substantial number of individuals with CLI do not undergo any revascularization attempt before amputation, 17 confirmed in the present analysis. Education about the importance of revascularization for limb salvage among primary care practitioners and ancillary services, like podiatry, are critical to improve outcomes for this condition. The optimal revascularization modality is more ambiguous, because investigations comparing different revascularization modalities have methodological limitations. Observational analyses comparing endovascular and surgical approaches are hindered by unmeasured confounding, even with optimal adjustment strategies. The most widely cited data for procedural care for this condition stem from a clinical trial that used an outdated definition of the disease entity, and the trial was performed before the current era of antiplatelet and statin therapy. 18 The results of the ongoing National Institutes of Health–sponsored randomized clinical trial assessing mortality and major adverse limb events after endovascular or surgical therapy (BEST‐CLI [Best Endovascular Versus Best Surgical Therapy for Patients With Critical Limb Ischemia] trial; unique identifier: NCT02060630) will be helpful in determining how best to approach revascularization in these patients. 19 Projected to complete in 2019 with a total enrollment of 2100 patients, the BEST‐CLI trial offers the promise of a definitive assessment of the optimal contemporary revascularization modality for CLI. While awaiting these results, it remains important to ensure that as many patients as possible are afforded the opportunity of attempted revascularization regardless of modality.

In summary, these data demonstrate the significant clinical and financial burden that CLI poses to our healthcare system. Considerable efforts are still needed to raise disease awareness and establish data that can guide further medical and procedural management given the critical importance of limb ischemia.

### Worth an arm and a leg: the critical importance of limb ischemia [^6056cc49]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Despite these limitations, the present analysis has significant value. CLI remains a disease entity associated with significant morbidity and mortality in elderly patients, with unacceptably high rates of adverse events despite intervention. Although patients had overall lower rates of amputation than previously reported, 7, 8 mortality remains exceedingly high, raising concerns about ongoing gaps in care for these patients after their revascularization. The data also demonstrate the extensive financial burden of this condition, which, if extrapolated beyond the 4‐year costs of Medicare patients to the population as a whole, would represent tens of billions of dollars annually. In an era with increasing awareness of healthcare quality and value‐based care, any improvement in clinical outcomes could lead to a significant reduction in healthcare expenditures. Finally, 40% of patients in this analysis received a primary treatment strategy other than attempted endovascular or surgical revascularization, and 30% of patients undergoing primary amputation did not carry a diagnosis of gangrene. These findings are surprising given the consensuses recommendations for revascularization as the first‐line therapy for this condition. 2

How then to address these findings? First, CLI requires a multidisciplinary assessment and treatment plan, including medical management of the overall atherosclerotic disease burden, ancillary services focused on wound care, and a focused assessment on the options for endovascular or surgical revascularization. Medical therapy, including antiplatelet agents, angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors, and statins, has been demonstrated to reduce adverse events in this vulnerable population. 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 Because of this, professional society guidelines have endorsed the use of these agents for all patients with peripheral artery disease and CLI. 14, 15 Unfortunately, adherence to these guidelines remains underwhelming, with only 32% of patients with CLI receiving all guideline‐recommended medical therapies in some series. 16 Implementation of programs that increase the adoption of guideline‐directed medical therapies is needed.

### Treatment for critical lower limb ischemia in elderly patients [^490399a4]. World Journal of Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Critical limb ischemia (CLI) has a poor outcome when left untreated. The benefits of revascularization in the very elderly might be limited because of co-morbidities and short life expectancy. Therefore, optimal management of CLI in the elderly is not straightforward. We analyzed treatment results for elderly patients with CLI (Rutherford 4 or 5/6) in our clinic.

Methods

Hospital charts of all patients > 70 years of age diagnosed with Rutherford stage 4–6 peripheral arterial disease between January 2006 and December 2009 were reviewed. We divided patients into two age groups (70–79 and ≥ 80 years) to compare treatment results. Primary interventions were defined as conservative, endovascular, reconstructive surgery, and amputation. Outcome measures were mortality, reintervention, and major amputation rates.

Results

There were 191 patients [99 (52%) were women], median age 78.4 years, range 70–98 years. Altogether, 119 (62%) patients were aged 70–79 years, and 72 (38%) were ≥ 80 years. The primary intervention was equally divided over the two age groups (p = 0.21). Trans-Atlantic Inter-Society Consensus Document on Management of Peripheral Arterial Disease (TASC II) classifications of aortoiliac lesions were not significantly different regarding intervention (p = 0.62) or age (p = 0.39). TASC II classification of femoropopliteal lesions was significantly different relative to intervention (p < 0.01) but not different between age groups (p = 0.68). Mortality rate after reconstructive surgery was significant higher in the oldest age group (p < 0.01). After conservative treatment, endovascular treatment, or amputation, the mortality rates were not significantly different between the two age groups (respectively, p = 0.06, p = 0.33, p = 0.76). Reintervention rate was 51% in the 70- to 79-year group compared to 32% in the ≥ 80-year group. After initial treatment, major amputations were performed in 10% in the 70- to 79-year group compared to 13% in the ≥ 80-year group.

Conclusions

In patients aged ≥ 80 years, surgical revascularization resulted in a significant higher mortality rate in our clinic, whereas primary conservative, endovascular treatment and amputation resulted in similar mortality in both age groups. When considering surgical revascularization in the very elderly, surgeons should focus on careful patient selection.

### The ongoing battle between infrapopliteal angioplasty and bypass surgery for critical limb ischemia [^0b742d12]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Critical limb ischemia (CLI) represents the extreme of the peripheral arterial occlusive disease spectrum and is associated with high mortality. Limb salvage often requires infrapopliteal revascularization by either angioplasty or bypass surgery. The past decade has witnessed a paradigm shift in CLI management toward endovascular treatment. This narrative review describes the clinical outcome, treatment strategy, and limitations of both modalities.

Method

A literature search was performed of the PubMed and Cochrane databases. All articles, published until September 2011, describing treatment by infrapopliteal arterial revascularization were included.

Results

Angioplasty and bypass surgery are both related to a limb salvage rate of approximately 80% at 3-year follow-up. Patency rates appear to be higher after surgery. A reliable comparison of the two modalities, however, is complicated by various confounders, including patient selection, lesion characteristics, and complication rates. Additionally, most studies did not describe the standard use of best medical treatment or outcome for relief of ischemic pain, wound healing, or functional improvement.

Conclusion

Infrapopliteal angioplasty and bypass surgery both provide an acceptable limb salvage rate, but patency appears to be better after bypass surgery. Both modalities are likely to be complementary. Additional randomized trials are indicated to provide a treatment algorithm for patients with CLI and infrapopliteal arterial occlusive disease.

Primary and Secondary End Points

The primary efficacy end point in the BEST‐CLI trial is Major Adverse Limb Event (MALE)–free survival (Table 5). This aggregate measure best captures the therapeutic goals of treatment for CLI, which include preservation of a functional limb and avoidance of major reinterventions that significantly impact QoL. Accurately assessing limb‐related morbidity and procedure‐related need for reintervention is of paramount importance in a trial comparing revascularization strategies, particularly in light of remaining questions regarding treatment durability. The MALE end point was devised by the SVS Objective Performance Goals Working Group specifically for use in clinical trials involving CLI patients. 10 This end point has been endorsed by both the SVS and the Food and Drug Administration. 10, 15, 31 MALE captures all major repeat vascular procedures on the index limb, including above‐ankle amputation and major reinterventions, defined by the creation of a new bypass graft, a jump/interposition graft revision, surgical thrombectomy with or without surgical patch angioplasty, and thrombectomy of an occluded graft or arterial segment using pharmacologic or mechanical thrombolysis. Notably, MALE excludes minor reinterventions, defined as surgical patch angioplasty (without graft thrombectomy), percutaneous transluminal angioplasty, atherectomy, laser treatment and/or stenting, or stent/grafting via either an open surgical exposure or percutaneous approaches, which are presumed to have less clinical impact. MALE‐free survival is felt to be superior as a primary efficacy end point to the historic standard of AFS, given that the primary goal of limb‐directed therapies for CLI is not to prolong survival but rather to relieve ischemic rest pain and heal leg‐threatening tissue loss. The failure of AFS to capture major treatment‐related reinterventions, and their direct impact on QoL and cost, significantly limits its utility in a trial designed to compare effectiveness of revascularization strategies. Nonetheless, because it combines 2 penultimate events of greatest magnitude for the CLI patient, AFS is included as a key secondary end point. Reintervention and amputation‐free survival is an additional important secondary end point that is defined as survival free from above‐ankle amputation of the index limb or major or minor reintervention. The BEST‐CLI trial will also examine MALE‐Peri‐Operative Death, which includes 30‐day perioperative mortality but excludes longer‐term mortality that is less likely related to the treatment of the limb.

Key Issues and Important Steps to Improve Evidence‐Based Management of CLI

High‐level evidence, typically level I, to guide evidence‐based clinical decision making in CLI is limited in contrast to coronary artery, carotid artery, and aortic aneurysm disease. 7, 18, 35, 36, 62 Well‐designed prospective studies and RCTs in CLI patients are sparse. 80 This may be related to the fact that studies in this specific population are not easy to conduct, due to the lower incidence of CLI compared to milder forms of PAD, and issues with respect to follow‐up of CLI patients. Furthermore, partially related to the aforementioned issues, there seems to be less interest from the pharmaceutical industry to initiate trials in this specific population. High‐quality epidemiological data on incidence, prevalence, and prognosis of CLI, particularly more recent data, are also sparse. 7, 8

Essential to a meaningful comparison and interpretation of study data is a more comprehensive definition and stratification of CLI. An important step towards such a more strict and meaningful stratification has been made by the Society of Vascular Surgery Lower Extremity Guidelines Committee, which proposed a novel classification system for the threatened lower limb. 81 This classification system is based on 3 major factors that impact amputation risk and clinical management: Wound, Ischemia, foot Infection (WIfI) and combines clinical factors with perfusion parameters. The ultimate goal of this new classification system is to provide more meaningful analyses of outcomes from various therapies among the heterogeneous limb ischemia population. Initial validation studies of this novel classification system have been promising and showed that the classification system nicely predicted wound healing and amputation risk. 81, 82

Given the temporal changes discussed above, along with the considerable heterogeneity of the CLI population, one should be careful when considering historical controls and nonrandomized cohorts in clinical research in CLI. Recently, the SVS‐CLI Working Group published Objective Performance Goals that provide benchmark values for various end points in CLI, AFS, and limb salvage, among others. 11 If these benchmark values are to be used as comparator in future CLI trials, it should be realized that these values can gradually change over time due to factors not related to the intervention per se, such as secondary prevention measures. It is advisable to regularly update the Objective Performance Goals to provide contemporary benchmark values. Additionally, the decline in event rates in clinical trials makes it more difficult to demonstrate superiority of a novel intervention, 83 which requires exponentially larger study sizes or are at risk to be underpowered.

### Comparison of 6-month outcomes of endovascular vs surgical revascularization for patients with critical limb ischemia [^a85d3f67]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Discussion

In this multicenter, retrospective cohort study of patients with CLI that compared ER with SR, we derived 4 important findings; compared with SR, ER was associated with (1) a higher risk of major amputations at 6 months, but this risk was similar when revascularization was performed in high-volume centers; (2) similar mortality, major adverse cardiovascular events, and unplanned all-cause readmission at 6 months; (3) better safety outcomes, including a lower risk of acute kidney injury, major bleeding, and vascular complications; and (4) lower resource use (shorter LOS and lower cost).

Although it is well known that CLI causes significant health care burden and mortality, to our knowledge, recent data on CLI peripheral interventions and outcomes are lacking. However, for the past 2 decades, the trend of SR has decreased with an increase in ER procedures. The Inter-Society Consensus for the Management of Peripheral Arterial Disease, along with the most recent guidelines from the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association, recommend revascularization as the optimal treatment. However, there is still debate between surgical and endovascular approaches as the first choice, given the lack of contemporary comparative data and the mixed results of observational studies.

### Endovascular intervention for tibial artery occlusive disease in patients with critical limb ischemia [^e1d00fe2]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Surgical bypass has traditionally been the gold standard for treating critical limb ischemia caused by isolated infrapopliteal arterial disease (IP CLI). However, as endovascular techniques continue to progress, they are increasingly applied to this patient population, especially to the high-risk surgical cohort or patients with limited surgical options. This enthusiasm to employ endovascular interventions in IP CLI is accompanied by persistent controversies, as demonstrated in the recent literature. Percutaneous transluminal balloon angioplasty has been the predominant endovascular intervention applied to treat IP CLI and recent literature supports its role. The durability of percutaneous transluminal balloon angioplasty is limited, and thus this intervention is recommended for high-risk patients with limited life expectancy. Bare-metal stents for IP CLI currently do not have supportive data to warrant their use as a primary treatment. Newer drug-eluting stents improve patency and prevent restenosis, but they do not significantly improve patient clinical status compared with bare-metal stents alone. Drug-coated balloons are still relatively new tools in this arena and evidence of their safety and clear efficacy are still lacking. The data on atherectomy, in all of its forms, for IP CLI are overall variable, without any clear benefit to justify its increased complication risks and costs over other modalities. Use of retrograde tibial/pedal access for treating IP CLI as a viable alternative to antegrade access and treatment from a totally retrograde approach has recently been described. Level I evidence to aid in clarifying the true efficacy for each of these endovascular modalities is greatly needed. As we await these data, we must remember that, as with any arterial intervention, proper patient selection is extremely important and the intervention, whether endovascular or open surgical repair, should be tailored to the individual patient's anatomy and disease characteristics.

### Design and rationale of the best endovascular versus best surgical therapy for patients with critical limb ischemia (BEST-CLI) trial [^4d521ae2]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

The BEST‐CLI trial has a robust cost‐effectiveness component that will serve to quantify the accumulated financial costs in each intervention arm. In addition, the trial will analyze a wide spectrum of relevant functional and QoL outcomes. Because endovascular and open revascularization may be associated with either similar or different rates of treatment success, assessing the additional safety, cost‐effectiveness, and QoL end points will be critical to accurately capturing the entirety of the clinical and economic benefit of each therapy. Cost‐effectiveness analysis will be based on longevity, QoL, and the economic value of any observed differences in these outcomes. This analysis will rely on prospectively collected information to characterize the resources consumed during each subject's initial revascularization hospitalization and all related subsequent inpatient and outpatient contacts with the medical system, including repeat hospitalization, outpatient physician visits, outpatient tests and procedures, emergency department visits, and medication use. The main measures of functional outcome will be EQ‐5D and VascuQoL, which are standardized, well‐validated instruments. The VascuQoL, a disease‐specific questionnaire that makes it possible to detect subtle changes in disease severity, will be used as the main CLI‐specific QoL outcome tool. 33 EQ‐5D comprehensively gauges global health‐related QoL and utilities, and will be the primary measure for cost‐utility analysis. 35

Given the limitations of the widely used Rutherford classification system, the SVS has recently developed a novel classification scheme for lower‐extremity threatened limbs, known as WIfI (Wound, Ischemia, and foot Infection), that is based on the extent and depth of wounds, the degree of ischemia, and the presence and extent of infection. 40 In addition to capturing the TransAtlantic Inter‐Society Consensus anatomic status of the index extremity, the BEST‐CLI trial has incorporated and aims to prospectively validate this novel Wound, Ischemia, and foot Infection classification system. The trial also utilizes a number of novel end points intended to capture all outcome parameters of interest. Some of these end points will focus on the implications of reinterventions, both major and minor, while others will directly measure the clinical and hemodynamic consequences of the CLI treatments under investigation.

CLI indicates critical limb ischemia;, endovascular therapy; PAD, peripheral artery disease;, single‐segment great saphenous vein.

Duplex ultrasound‐based mapping of potential autogenous venous conduit is required prior to randomization to assign subjects into either Cohort 1 (adequate single‐segment greater saphenous vein) or Cohort 2 (absence of adequate‐single segment greater saphenous vein). Subjects entered into Cohort 1 are anticipated, based on preprocedure assessment of the saphenous vein status, to have a single segment of ipsilateral or contralateral greater saphenous vein of sufficient length to perform an open surgical bypass at the time of randomization. Conversely, subjects in Cohort 2 are believed not to have a single segment of saphenous vein sufficient for bypass surgery and are anticipated to require revascularization with either arm vein, short saphenous vein, spliced vein, cryopreserved vein, prosthetic conduit, or some combination of the above should they be randomized to surgical bypass. Subjects enrolled in Cohort 1 who are subsequently found to have saphenous vein that is insufficient in length or quality to perform a single‐segment bypass and who instead undergo bypass with an alternative conduit will be analyzed on an intention‐to‐treat basis in their originally designated cohort. Similarly, any subject enrolled into Cohort 2 and subsequently found at the time of bypass surgery to have a sufficient single segment of saphenous vein will remain in Cohort 2 for the intention‐to‐treat analysis.

Investigators have the option of randomizing and treating a subject immediately following confirmatory diagnostic angiography, or waiting until a later time to randomize. The assigned treatment must be undertaken within 30 days of randomization.

Trial Organization and Oversight

Figure 3 details the overall structural organization of the BEST‐CLI trial and the specific interrelationships between the Clinical Coordinating Center, the Data Coordinating Center, the Cost‐Effectiveness Core, Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB), the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute study sponsor, and the participating trial sites. The Operations Committee comprises the Principal Investigators of the Clinical Coordinating Center, Data Coordinating Center and Cost‐Effectiveness Core, as well as the Program Officers of the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, and is responsible for the day‐to‐day conduct of the trial. The Executive Committee (EC) comprises members of the Operations Committee, in addition to leading experts in the disciplines of vascular medicine, interventional radiology, interventional cardiology, and vascular surgery (Table 6). The balance of subspecialty membership of the EC reflects the mix of clinical disciplines currently managing patients with CLI within the United States and Canada. The EC meets in person or by phone on a monthly basis and serves in both an advisory and an oversight role. An independent Protocol Review Committee of individuals with appropriate expertise was appointed by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute and was responsible for approval of the initial BEST‐CLI trial Protocol. Subsequently, a DSMB was constituted in part from members of the Protocol Review Committee. The DSMB meets semiannually over the course of the trial and has ongoing responsibility for the overall safe conduct of the trial, as well as approval of any protocol amendments and ancillary studies.

### 2016 AHA / ACC guideline on the management of patients with lower extremity peripheral artery disease: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines [^92316bde]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Medium credibility.

Critical limb ischemia (CLI) — revascularization recommendations — in patients with CLI, revascularization should be performed when possible to minimize tissue loss. In a systematic review of 13 studies of patients with CLI who did not receive revascularization, there was a 22% all-cause mortality rate and a 22% rate of major amputation at a median follow-up of 12 months. The goal of surgical or endovascular revascularization is to provide in-line blood flow to the foot through at least 1 patent artery, and revascularization is not warranted in the setting of a nonviable limb. An evaluation for revascularization options should be performed by an interdisciplinary care team before amputation in the patient with CLI, and before amputation, evaluation generally includes imaging for assessment of revascularization options such as duplex ultrasound, CTA, MRA, or catheter-based angiogram.

Surgical revascularization for critical limb ischemia (CLI) — recommendations with category labels are as follows: I A When surgery is performed for CLI, bypass to the popliteal or infrapopliteal arteries (i.e., tibial, pedal) should be constructed with suitable autogenous vein; I C-LD Surgical procedures are recommended to establish in-line blood flow to the foot in patients with nonhealing wounds or gangrene; IIa B-NR In patients with CLI for whom endovascular revascularization has failed and a suitable autogenous vein is not available, prosthetic material can be effective for bypass to the below-knee popliteal and tibial arteries; and IIa C-LD A staged approach to surgical procedures is reasonable in patients with ischemic rest pain.

Chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI) — perioperative risk assessment for revascularization candidates: Estimate periprocedural risk and life expectancy in patients with CLTI who are candidates for revascularization, and define a CLTI patient as average surgical risk when anticipated periprocedural mortality is < 5% and estimated 2-year survival is > 50%, while defining high surgical risk when anticipated periprocedural mortality is ≥ 5% or estimated 2-year survival is ≤ 50%.
