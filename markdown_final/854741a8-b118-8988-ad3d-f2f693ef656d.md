## Question

Sensibility and specificitivity from the Typhus Serologie?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the sensitivity and specificity of typhus serology. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about which "typhus" is meant, because scrub typhus, murine typhus, and epidemic typhus have different serologic behaviors and reference standards. Then, I should verify the reference standard used in each study, since IFA cutoffs and paired-serology criteria vary by geography and methodology. Next, I will extract sensitivity and specificity estimates for the main serologic modalities and note timing effects. After that, I should consider cross-reactivity and antibody persistence that limit specificity. Finally, I will synthesize practical recommendations and highlight where molecular tests can complement serology, especially early in disease.

> Let me first confirm the terminology, because "typhus serology" is ambiguous. In clinical and travel medicine contexts, "typhus" usually refers to rickettsial diseases such as scrub typhus (Orientia tsutsugamushi), murine typhus (Rickettsia typhi), and epidemic typhus (Rickettsia prowazekii), which are diagnosed primarily by serology with IFA as the reference method, whereas "typhoid" refers to Salmonella enteric fever and is a different entity entirely. I should keep these separate to avoid conflating performance metrics [^7a57ab9d] [^810e3ec3].

> Now, for scrub typhus, I need to check the reference standard and optimal cutoffs. Multiple studies using Bayesian latent class models support an IFA IgM cutoff of ≥ 1:3,200 in admission samples or a ≥ 4-fold rise to ≥ 1:3,200 in convalescent samples, yielding sensitivity around 81–82% and specificity around 100% in Thailand cohorts. Wait, let me verify the exact figures: yes, sensitivity 81.6% and specificity 100% in one analysis, and similar high specificity with comparable sensitivity in related work, which aligns with the broader literature base [^cf01f4ab] [^1ba09fa8] [^048900e8].

> Hold on, I should verify alternatives to IFA because IFA is not always available. ELISA using recombinant 56-kDa antigens performs well; in one study, an IgM ELISA with an optimal OD cutoff of 1.474 at 1:400 dilution had sensitivity 85.7% and specificity 98.1% using paired samples, and another analysis using a 0.6 OD cutoff reported sensitivity 84.2% and specificity 98.3% in patients presenting 5–11 days after fever onset. Let me double-check the timing effect: sensitivity is indeed lower in very early disease, which is why paired sampling improves performance [^0d14f02f] [^298b4192] [^4f961fca].

> Next, I should review rapid immunochromatographic tests for scrub typhus, because clinicians often ask about point-of-care options. The sensitivity of ICTs is modest and highly dependent on timing; in Laos, sensitivity ranged from about 24% in acute-phase samples to roughly 39% when using a 1:400 IFA reference, with specificity around 86–100% depending on the reference standard. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought specificity was consistently 99%, but I should correct that: specificity varied with the chosen reference, and while it can be high, it is not uniformly 99% across studies, reinforcing that ICTs are not sufficiently sensitive for early diagnosis but may have a role in epidemiologic screening or when combined with other modalities [^f446ffd1] [^825ec73d] [^40390c2a].

> For murine typhus, I need to check whether single-titer cutoffs are valid or whether paired serology is required. The CDC notes that diagnosis is serologically confirmed by a fourfold rise in antibody titer between acute and convalescent samples, and that IgM is not reliable for diagnosis; paired IFA is the most common approach, with antibodies typically appearing after 7–10 days. Let me verify whether any study provides optimized single-titer cutoffs: yes, in Vientiane, Bayesian modeling suggested optimal admission cutoffs of IgM ≥ 1:800 and IgG ≥ 1:600, yielding sensitivity around 78–77% and specificity around 90–99%, respectively, but these are region-specific and should be interpreted cautiously outside that setting [^5f081a0e] [^d15f8789] [^43c3a381].

> I should confirm cross-reactivity and antibody persistence issues that undermine specificity. Typhus-group rickettsiae show cross-reactivity, and IgG can persist for months to years, so a static single titer may reflect prior infection rather than acute disease. This is why guidelines emphasize paired serology with a fourfold rise, and why region-specific background seroprevalence matters when choosing cutoffs. Hold on, I should verify that this applies across typhus species: yes, cross-reactivity within the typhus group and persistent antibodies are repeatedly cited as limitations necessitating paired samples or very high single-titer thresholds in endemic settings [^5f081a0e] [^600aa56c] [^b0e7fc0e].

> Let me consider epidemic typhus briefly, since the question is broad. Serologic diagnosis follows the same principle: document a fourfold rise in IFA titer between acute and convalescent samples, recognizing cross-reactivity with R. typhi and the need for specialized testing in nonendemic regions. I should confirm that CDC provides this guidance and that testing is often routed through public health laboratories; yes, that is correct, and it reinforces the paired-serology paradigm for typhus-group infections [^600aa56c] [^7a57ab9d].

> But wait, what if the patient presents very early, before seroconversion? I need to ensure I address molecular diagnostics. PCR can detect Orientia or Rickettsia DNA in blood or eschar during the first week of illness, with higher sensitivity in eschar samples than blood; sensitivities vary by assay and timing, but eschar PCR can reach about 86% sensitivity with 100% specificity in scrub typhus cohorts, and multiplex or real-time PCRs expand early detection when serology is negative. This is why combining PCR with serology improves diagnostic coverage across the disease course [^0eda99f3] [^8095ee46] [^7a57ab9d].

> I should double-check the practical synthesis before concluding. For scrub typhus, IFA IgM at ≥ 1:3,200 or a ≥ 4-fold rise provides the best-validated balance of sensitivity and specificity, with ELISA alternatives offering comparable or slightly better sensitivity and excellent specificity when paired samples are available. For murine typhus, paired IFA remains the reference, with region-specific single-titer cutoffs explored but not universally adopted. Across typhus infections, single acute-phase serology has limited negative predictive value early in disease, so a negative test does not exclude infection, and clinicians should integrate timing, eschar, and, when available, PCR to guide timely doxycycline therapy [^cf01f4ab] [^0d14f02f] [^5f081a0e] [^7a57ab9d].

Typhus serology (IFA) has **sensitivity 81.6% and specificity 100%** [^cf01f4ab] for scrub typhus when using an IgM cutoff of ≥ 1:3,200 or a ≥ 4-fold rise to ≥ 1:3,200 in paired sera [^1ba09fa8]. For murine typhus, **optimal IFA cutoffs are IgM ≥ 1:800 (sensitivity 78.6%, specificity 89.9%) and IgG ≥ 1:600 (sensitivity 77.3%, specificity 99.0%)** [^d15f8789] [^43c3a381]. Performance varies by assay, timing, and endemicity; **paired sera improve accuracy** [^7a57ab9d], and cross-reactivity within typhus group rickettsiae can limit specificity [^5f081a0e] [^600aa56c].

## Scrub typhus serology

### Indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA)

- **Gold standard**: IFA is the reference serologic test for scrub typhus [^b0e7fc0e] [^298b4192].
- **Optimal cutoffs**: IgM ≥ 1:3,200 in admission samples or a ≥ 4-fold rise to ≥ 1:3,200 in convalescent samples yields sensitivity 81.6% and specificity 100% [^cf01f4ab] [^1ba09fa8].
- **Limitations**: Subjectivity, need for paired sera, and limited availability in resource-limited settings [^b79f31ed] [^2e20e9d0].

---

### Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)

- **Alternative to IFA**: ELISA offers objective, quantitative results and higher throughput [^b79f31ed] [^58854593].
- **Performance**: In northern Thailand, an IgM ELISA with cutoff OD 1.474 at 1:400 dilution had sensitivity 85.7% and specificity 98.1% using paired samples [^0d14f02f].
- **Advantages**: Less subjective than IFA and suitable for automation [^b79f31ed] [^58854593].

---

### Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs)

- **Limited utility**: RDTs have lower sensitivity, especially in early disease [^825ec73d] [^f446ffd1].
- **Performance**: In Laos, IgM ICT sensitivity was 23.8–39.1% with specificity 86.2–99.5%, depending on the reference standard [^f446ffd1] [^fb4af116].
- **Role**: Useful when IFA/ELISA are unavailable, but negative results do not exclude infection [^f446ffd1] [^825ec73d].

---

## Murine typhus serology

### Indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA)

- **Gold standard**: IFA is the reference serologic test for murine typhus [^b0b8cbb2] [^5f081a0e].
- **Optimal cutoffs**: IgM ≥ 1:800 (sensitivity 78.6%, specificity 89.9%) and IgG ≥ 1:600 (sensitivity 77.3%, specificity 99.0%) in endemic settings [^d15f8789] [^43c3a381].
- **Limitations**: Persistent antibodies from prior infection can confound interpretation; paired sera are preferred [^5f081a0e] [^d15f8789].

---

### Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs)

RDTs for murine typhus are limited by **low sensitivity** and **moderate specificity**. In Laos, an IgM immunoblot had sensitivity 54.6–61.2% and specificity 86.5–94.1%, depending on the reference standard [^f446ffd1] [^a00f6243]. Like scrub typhus RDTs, they may aid diagnosis when IFA is unavailable, but negative results do not exclude infection [^f446ffd1] [^a00f6243].

---

## Factors influencing diagnostic accuracy

Several factors influence the **accuracy of typhus serology**:

| **Factor** | **Impact on accuracy** |
|-|-|
| Assay type | IFA and ELISA generally outperform RDTs [^cf01f4ab] [^0d14f02f] [^f446ffd1] |
| Timing of sample collection | Early samples reduce sensitivity; paired sera improve accuracy [^7a57ab9d] [^5f081a0e] |
| Endemicity | High background seroprevalence lowers specificity [^d15f8789] [^43c3a381] |
| Antigenic variation | Strain diversity can reduce sensitivity [^09b69503] [^34e1c3ab] |
| Cross-reactivity | Within typhus group rickettsiae limits specificity [^5f081a0e] [^600aa56c] |

---

## Summary of sensitivity and specificity

| **Disease** | **Assay** | **Sensitivity (%)** | **Specificity (%)** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Scrub typhus | IFA (IgM ≥ 1:3,200) | 81.6 | 100 [^cf01f4ab] [^1ba09fa8] |
| Scrub typhus | ELISA (IgM) | 85.7 | 98.1 [^0d14f02f] |
| Scrub typhus | RDT (IgM ICT) | 23.8–39.1 | 86.2–99.5 [^f446ffd1] [^fb4af116] |
| Murine typhus | IFA (IgM ≥ 1:800) | 78.6 | 89.9 [^d15f8789] [^43c3a381] |
| Murine typhus | IFA (IgG ≥ 1:600) | 77.3 | 99.0 [^d15f8789] [^43c3a381] |
| Murine typhus | RDT (IgM IBT) | 54.6–61.2 | 86.5–94.1 [^f446ffd1] [^a00f6243] |

---

Typhus serology has **moderate-to-high sensitivity and high specificity** when optimal cutoffs and paired sera are used, with IFA and ELISA outperforming RDTs. Performance is context-dependent, so results should be interpreted alongside clinical findings, epidemiology, and, when available, molecular tests [^7a57ab9d] [^d59cf5ad].

### Scrub typhus: a reemerging infection [^185db218]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Scrub typhus, caused by Orientia tsutsugamushi, is a widely neglected disease which is gaining global momentum because of its resurgence patterns. The disease is now being reported in newer regions as well as areas previously endemic areas. In this review, we aim to comprehensively review the data available to assist physicians in making an accurate diagnosis and appropriate management of the disease.

Recent Findings

Several diagnostic tests have been developed for confirming scrub typhus. However, there is lack of clarity on which tests are most appropriate in a given clinical scenario. A recent study has demonstrated that in early disease (< 7 days) when serological tests remain negative, the quantitative polymerase chain reaction is the most sensitive test. Among the serological tests, both IgM enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay as well as rapid diagnostic tests revealed excellent sensitivities and specificities.

Summary

With the reemergence of scrub typhus, a high degree of clinical suspicion is required to appropriately diagnose this disease which presents as an acute febrile illness. It can progress to develop various complications leading to multi-organ dysfunction syndrome. Mild illness responds well to antibiotic treatment with doxycycline and azithromycin. Further studies are required to determine the most optimal therapy in severe scrub typhus infections and superiority of one drug over the other.

### Challenges and opportunities for typhoid fever control: a call for coordinated action [^0afc1e79]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Serological assays, primarily the Felix–Widal test, which measures agglutinating antibody levels against the O and H antigens, are poorly sensitive or specific, and have been largely dismissed as an effective diagnostic tool. However, they are cheap and still widely used in developing countries despite low utility. Rapid diagnostic tests for the identification of S. Typhi bacteria are desirable and several are available; unfortunately, they are also not sensitive or specific and are therefore not useful for diagnosis and treatment. Polymerase chain reaction–based assays are also increasingly available, yet despite early optimism, have failed to meet the challenges of a rapid, reliable, specific, and sensitive diagnostic and require advanced laboratory equipment and technical expertise, which tend to be available only in central higher-end laboratories. Work is under way to develop improved, simple, robust, and field-usable diagnostics as described by Andrews et al, but challenges still exist in this important area and continue to impede progress in the identification and management of enteric fever.

### Selection of diagnostic cutoffs for murine typhus IgM and IgG immunofluorescence assay: a systematic review [^a934835d]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Medium credibility.

From this review, we cannot conclude a single standardized cutoff titer for murine typhus; however, there are some clinical aspects that are important to note. In terms of treatment, murine typhus is treatable with doxycycline, which is an affordable and safe drug. It is possible to prescribe doxycycline in patients who present with non-malarial febrile illness symptoms; however, it could result in no effect as the patient may be infected with a disease not sensitive to doxycycline. Thus, it is essential to accurately diagnose the disease in patients, for which a validated threshold is needed. In highly endemic areas, there are high backgrounds of murine typhus, which poses a potential for false positivity if the cutoff is set too low.

Further research is required to examine the local levels of background immunity, identify circulating antigenic strains, and assess different IFA testing protocols, to make well-versed decisions regarding a region-specific, standardized IFA methodology and cutoff. The prospective cause of fever studies could be carried out in different geographical localities in urban versus rural areas to validate an optimal region-specific cutoff. Moreover, the timing of serum collection and pairing of sera could be assessed to formulate a criterion to classify confirmed versus probable cases, rather than focus on a single-titer cutoff.

### Clinical characteristics and outcome of children hospitalized with scrub typhus in an area of endemicity [^0808b8c8]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2020). Medium credibility.

All of these assays have inherent weaknesses. The perceived accuracy of serological tests (eg, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, IFAs) depend on the antigenic complement of the assay with the infecting bacterial strain and the extent of residual antibodies in the population within areas of endemicity. PCR assays and culture are specific, but their sensitivity can vary, depending on the quality of the samples, disease time point, and bacterial load. Moreover, the limited validation studies performed to date have been focused on adult samples, which results in a degree of uncertainty regarding the accuracy of these assays for children.

In this study, we aimed to characterize pediatric scrub typhus and explore the determinants of treatment outcome in a region for which it was reported to be suboptimal. We investigated the use of robust and validated diagnostic criteria that had not been applied to children previously. To achieve these goals, a prospective observational study in children with scrub typhus in northern Thailand was performed, incorporating a prolonged follow-up period and healthy control group from the same region.

### Selection of diagnostic cutoffs for murine typhus IgM and IgG immunofluorescence assay: a systematic review [^4196fda4]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Medium credibility.

Moreover, in addition to the lack of IFA methodology standardization, there was also a lack of consensus in the reference comparator or "gold standard reference assay" to determine murine typhus diagnostic cutoffs. The absence of standardized methods and validated cutoffs has serious implications for seroepidemiological and clinical research, as well as implications for patients and healthcare workers. Although a lower cutoff would result in increased false-positive results, a higher cutoff would result in increased false-negative results, causing cases to go undiagnosed and increasing the possibility of those patients developing severe complications.

This review has numerous limitations. First, it only investigated studies published in or translated to English. Second, a single author performed the article selection and data extraction, although any ambiguous data were reviewed among the authors to limit bias. Third, the number of diagnostic accuracy studies included was limited, and, perhaps, the study design affects the positivity cutoff titer used for IFA testing. Therefore, it is difficult to conclude whether there exists a correlation or causation between study designs and cutoff titers. Fourth, this review did not consider the timing of serum collection and the collection of paired sera in relation to the disease. The timing of sample collection in relation to illness onset is an important factor to consider when analyzing a positive serological result. Last, the IFA protocol was not assessed as a factor. This is essential to consider when analyzing results, as variances in protocol (i.e. the quantity of antigen used and inactivation techniques) can affect the sensitivity and specificity of IFA tests, which in turn can affect the selection of optimal cutoffs. Moreover, this review examined both IFA and IIP tests, and the two protocols were not differentiated in this study.

INTRODUCTION

Murine typhus is a neglected infectious disease caused by Rickettsia typhi, a Gram-negative, obligate intracellular bacterium. Rickettsia typhi is primarily transmitted by Xenopsylla cheopis, the rat flea. Commensal rats (most commonly Rattus rattus and Rattus norvegicus) are the natural animal reservoir of the disease. Infection in humans occurs either through inoculation of infected flea feces into bite wounds or by inhalation of aerosolized flea feces. –

Given that other febrile illnesses, such as dengue, leptospirosis, and typhoid, have similar clinical manifestations to murine typhus, laboratory tests are essential to differentiate murine typhus from other causes of undifferentiated fever. Serological methods are commonly used to diagnose murine typhus because of their simplicity and cost-effectiveness. The indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) is considered the "gold standard" and reference technique for diagnosing murine typhus in most research laboratories. –, Immunofluorescence assay identification of IgM and IgG antibodies provides definitive and accurate evidence of exposure. The immunoperoxidase assay (IIP) is an alternative to IFA and obtains results that have a similar sensitivity and specificity.

The diagnostic accuracy of IFA is subjective and reliant on methodological and patient factors. Despite being the current reference and standard technique, there is little consensus on the standardization of the IFA methodology. Variable methodological factors include the antigenic strains used and antibody isotype targeted, as well as the diagnostic cutoffs used. Therefore, to guarantee accuracy of diagnosis, standardized methodologies and locally authenticated positivity cutoff limits for diagnostic and epidemiological purposes are required.

This review aims to summarize 1) the differences in published IFA methodologies, 2) the diagnostic cutoff titers used for a positive murine typhus diagnosis, and 3) the justification of these diagnostic cutoffs.

### Enteric fever [^2faf56d2]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Serological tests, including the Widal test and newer rapid diagnostic tests, are not confirmatory in the acute phase of illness. The Widal test measures antibodies against O and H antigens of S Typhi and S Paratyphi A. It is cheap and simple but lacks sensitivity and specificity. A single measurement in the acute phase of the illness may be false negative or false positive. Other commercially available, point-of-care rapid diagnostic tests detect IgM antibodies against S Typhi antigens. These are insufficiently accurate to be useful in diagnosis (see supplementary table 2). In a diagnostic accuracy review, the TUBEX test (14 studies) had an average sensitivity of 78% (95% CI 71% to 85%) and specificity of 87% (82% to 91%). The Typhidot test had an average sensitivity of 66% (59% to 73%) with a specificity of 81% (58% to 93%)across a number of versions. Novel assays to detect antibodies, antigens, and DNA in blood are being developed.

In endemic areas and returning travellers, rule out malaria and dengue fever with testing. Consider other causes of acute fever based on local disease patterns — such as scrub and murine typhus, leptospirosis, brucellosis, influenza, chikungunya, and covid-19 and other viral conditions.

### Identification of a novel antigen for serological diagnosis of scrub typhus [^34e1c3ab]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2021). Medium credibility.

Scrub typhus is an acute infectious disease caused by the bacterium Orientia tsutsugamushi, which is widely distributed in northern, southern, and eastern Asia. Early diagnosis is essential because the average case fatality rate is usually > 10% but can be as high as 45% if antimicrobial treatment is delayed. Although an O. tsutsugamushi 56-kDa type-specific antigen (TSA) is commonly used for serological diagnosis of scrub typhus, the 56-kDa TSA shows variations among O. tsutsugamushi strains, which may lead to poor diagnostic results. Therefore, the discovery of new antigenic proteins may improve diagnostic accuracy. In this study, we identified an O. tsutsugamushi 27 kDa antigen through an immunoinformatic approach and verified its diagnostic potential using patient samples. Compared with the O. tsutsugamushi 56-kDa antigen, the new 27-kDa antigen showed better diagnostic specificity with similar diagnostic sensitivity. Therefore, the O. tsutsugamushi 27-kDa antigen shows potential as a novel serological diagnostic antigen for scrub typhus, providing higher diagnostic accuracy for O. tsutsugamushi than the 56-kDa antigen.

### Selection of diagnostic cutoffs for murine typhus IgM and IgG immunofluorescence assay: a systematic review [^acfe840a]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Medium credibility.

Murine typhus is a neglected but widespread infectious disease that results in acute fever. The immunofluorescence assay (IFA) is the "gold standard" to identify IgM or IgG antibodies, although there is a lack of standardization in methodologies. The objective of this review is to summarize 1) the differences in published methodologies, 2) the diagnostic cutoff titers, and 3) the justification of diagnostic cutoffs. Searches were performed by combining the following search terms: "murine typhus", " rickettsia typhi ", "immunofluorescence", "IFA", and "serologic" with restrictions (i.e., " rickettsia typhi " or "murine typhus", and "IFA" or "immunofluorescence", or "serologic"). The search identified 78 studies that used IFA or immunoperoxidase assay (IIP) antibody cutoffs to diagnose murine typhus, 39 of which were case series. Overall, 45 studies (57.7%) provided little to no rationale as to how the cutoff was derived. Variation was seen locally in the cutoff titers used, but a 4-fold or greater increase was often applied. The cutoffs varied depending on the antibody target. No consensus was observed in establishing a cutoff, or for a single-value diagnostic cutoff. In conclusion, there is a lack of consensus in the establishment of a single-value cutoff. Further studies will need to be executed at each distinct geographic location to identify region-specific cutoffs, while also considering background antibody levels to distinguish between healthy and infected patients.

### Scrub typhus serologic testing with the indirect immunofluorescence method as a diagnostic gold standard: a lack of consensus leads to a lot of confusion [^b0e7fc0e]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

A review was performed to determine the evidence base for scrub typhus indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) methodologies and the criteria for positive results. This review included a total of 109 publications, which comprised 123 eligible studies for analysis (14 publications included 2 substudies). There was considerable underreporting of the IFA methodology and seropositivity criteria used, with most studies using a defined cutoff titer rather than an increase in the titer in paired samples. The choice of positivity cutoff titer varied by country and purpose of the IFA test. This variation limits the comparability of seroprevalence rates between studies and, more seriously, raises questions about the appropriateness of the cutoffs for positive IFA results chosen for diagnosis of acute scrub typhus infection. We suggest that the diagnosis of scrub typhus using IFA should be based on a ≥ 4-fold increase in the titer in paired serum samples and should only be based on a single sample titer when there is an adequate local evidence base.

### Clinical overview of murine typhus… [^5f081a0e]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Diagnostic Testing Laboratory assays for the diagnosis of murine typhus diagnosis include:

- Indirect fluorescent antibody assay
- Immunohistochemistry on tissue biopsy specimens
- Polymerase chain reaction assays using blood, plasma, or tissue specimens
- Isolation of. R. typhiin culture Paired serologic testing using IFA is the most common means of confirming murine typhus and can be used to detect IgG antibodies. Diagnosis is serologically confirmed by demonstrating a four-fold rise in antibody titer between acute and convalescent samples. Acute specimens are taken during the first week of illness and convalescent samples are taken 2–10 weeks later. IgM antibodies are not reliable and should not be used for the diagnosis of murine typhus. Detectable levels of IgG antibody generally do not appear until 7–10 days after the onset of illness.

A stationary titer between appropriately timed acute and convalescent serum samples is suggestive of prior exposure and not recent infection. PCR can detect R. typhi during acute illness, and is most sensitive when performed on specimens collected during the first week of illness, and prior to the start of doxycycline. However, PCR is insufficiently sensitive to rule out infection, and a negative PCR result should not dissuade clinicians from treating patients in whom murine typhus is suspected. Because antibody titers may be persistently elevated in some individuals for years after their initial exposure or infection, only demonstration of recent changes in titers between paired specimens are considered to be a reliable retrospective serologic confirmation of acute murine typhus infection. R. typhi antigens frequently cross-react with those of R. prowazekii and R. felis, and less often with R. rickettsii.

IHC can be used to detect infection with typhus group Rickettsia in formalin-fixed tissue samples. PCR of whole blood or tissue can distinguish between infection with R. typhi and R. prowazekii although the sensitivity of these assays varies considerably based on the sample type, timing of sample collection, and the severity of disease.

### State of the art of diagnosis of rickettsial diseases: the use of blood specimens for diagnosis of scrub typhus, spotted fever group rickettsiosis, and murine typhus [^d59cf5ad]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

With improved malaria control, acute undifferentiated febrile illness studies in tropical regions reveal a startling proportion of rickettsial illnesses, especially scrub typhus, murine typhus, and spotted fever group rickettsioses. Laboratory diagnosis of these infections evolved little over the past 40 years, but combinations of technologies like PCR and loop-mediated isothermal amplification, with refined rapid diagnostic tests and/or ELISA, are promising for guidance for early antirickettsial treatment.

Recent Findings

The long-term reliance on serological tests - useful only late in rickettsial infections - has led to underdiagnosis, inappropriate therapies, and undocumented morbidity and mortality. Recent approaches integrate nucleic acid amplification and recombinant protein-based serological tests for diagnosing scrub typhus. Optimized using Bayesian latent class analyses, this strategy increases diagnostic confidence and enables early accurate diagnosis and treatment - a model to follow for lagging progress in murine typhus and spotted fever.

Summary

A laboratory diagnostic paradigm shift in rickettsial infections is evolving, with replacement of indirect immunofluorescence assay by the more objective ELISA coupled with nucleic acid amplification assays to expand the diagnostic window toward early infection intervals. This approach supports targeted antirickettsial therapy, reduces morbidity and mortality, and provides a robust evidence base for further development of diagnostics and vaccines.

### Antibiotics for treating scrub typhus [^7f7b0778]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Methods

Criteria for considering studies for this review

Types of studies

We searched for all relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs. We define quasi‐RCTs as those using an allocation method that is not truly random (for example, based on date of birth).

Types of participants

Trials had to include people with a diagnosis of scrub typhus based on clinical symptoms and compatible laboratory tests, including the following.

Serology (IFA, ELISA, RDT).
Nucleic acid amplification (PCR).
Isolation (cell culture).

Given the poor specificity of the Weil‐Felix test, we excluded studies that used this as the sole measure to confirm the diagnosis.

Types of interventions

Interventions

Anti‐rickettsial antibiotics, irrespective of route of administration, dose, dose frequency, or course duration.

Controls

Other anti‐rickettsial antibiotics. We excluded studies comparing interventions versus placebo or no drug as it is clear antibiotics are effective. We planned to include trials that provided additional interventions to all treatment arms, but we did not encounter such trials.

Types of outcome measures

Primary outcomes

Treatment failure, defined as persistence of symptoms at the end of the treatment course.
Resolution of fever within 48 hours.

Secondary outcomes

Resolution of fever within five days.
Time to defervescence Defined as the time interval between administration of the first dose of antibiotic and the first time at which temperature was less than 37.5°C and was thereafter maintained for > 48 hours.
Serious adverse events.
Frequency and types of reported adverse events.

Diagnostic accuracy questions.

1) In a patient with suspected acute typhus infection, how accurate were the ST ICT and MT IBT in diagnosis of scrub and murine typhus, respectively, in absolute terms, when compared with previously established diagnostic criteria for scrub typhus?

For the ST ICT, when we used the stringent ≥ 4-fold increase in IFA titer between paired serum samples as the diagnostic criterion, sensitivity of the ST ICT for admission-phase samples was 23.8% (24 of 101; 95% CI = 15.9–33.3%). For patients with an IgM IFA titer ≥ 1:400, sensitivity was 39.1% (147 of 376; 95% CI = 34.1–44.2%). Specificities were 86.2% (126 of 929; 95% CI = 84.1–88.6%) and 99.5% (3 of 654; 95% CI = 98.7–99.9%), respectively. For samples with a ≥ 4-fold increased IFA titer between paired serum samples or IgM IFA titer ≥ 1:400, sensitivity was 34.7% (148 of 426; 95% CI = 30.2–39.5%) and specificity was 99.7% (2 of 604; 95% CI = 98.8–100%) (Table 1).

### Plasma immunoglobulin A responses against 2 Salmonella typhi antigens identify patients with typhoid fever [^80aa135b]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Typhoid fever remains a significant public health problem, with > 11 million cases each year resulting in an estimated 130000 deaths. A major challenge in typhoid management and control is the lack of a reliable, simple diagnostic assay. Lack of optimal diagnostics for typhoid fever limits our ability to diagnose acute cases of typhoid fever, which is often diagnosed clinically and treated empirically. This has led to substantial overdiagnosis and the overprescribing of antityphoid antimicrobials, which has driven emergence of antimicrobial resistance, especially fluoroquinolone resistance in Asia. Misdiagnosis also often leads to delay of care for the true causative pathogen of the febrile illness, such as typhus or leptospirosis. Improved diagnostics for typhoid fever would not only improve patient management and outcomes but would also extend surveillance efforts to provide reliable estimates of disease burden and allow for better targeting and evaluation of typhoid intervention strategies, especially given the recent endorsement from the World Health Organization (WHO) Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization and WHO position statement on the use of typhoid Vi conjugate vaccines.

### Clinical guidance for typhoid fever and paratyphoid fever… [^2a77287c]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose
- This page provides information healthcare providers can use to identify, diagnose, and treat typhoid fever and paratyphoid fever.
- It also provides information that can be useful for counseling patients who travel to places where these diseases are common. Evaluation Clinical features Typhoid fever and paratyphoid fever are systemic illnesses caused by Salmonella Typhi and Salmonella Paratyphi, respectively. Both diseases have an insidious onset characterized by some or all of the following symptoms:

- Fever
- Headache
- Constipation or diarrhea
- Malaise
- Chills
- Myalgias
- Emesis. A transient, maculopapular rash of rose spots may be present on the trunk. Severe cases may have encephalopathy, gastrointestinal bleeding, or intestinal perforation, which typically occur after 2–3 weeks of illness. Few clinical features reliably distinguish these illnesses from a variety of other infectious diseases. Diagnosis Blood culture is the mainstay of diagnosis.

Bone marrow cultures have sensitivity of 80% in some studies and can remain positive despite antibiotic therapy. Stool and urine cultures are positive less frequently. Usually, multiple cultures are needed to identify the pathogen. Serologic tests, such as the Widal test, are not recommended because of the high rate of false positives. CDC offers testing for Salmonella Typhi and Salmonella Paratyphi. CDC accepts specimens for analysis only from state public health laboratories and other federal agencies. Private healthcare providers and institutions must submit specimens to their state public health laboratory for processing. Treatment Antibiotic use helps patients recover faster and lowers the risk of complications and death. High rates of antimicrobial resistance can limit treatment options. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing can help guide treatment decisions. While waiting for culture results, obtain a thorough travel history to inform empiric treatment.
- Ceftriaxone resistance is now common among travelers returning from Iraq and Pakistan. It has been observed less frequently in travelers returning from neighboring countries, including India and Afghanistan. For patients who. About 10% of inadequately treated patients experience relapse, with an illness that is often milder than the initial one. Relapse can happen 1–3 weeks after recovery from the initial illness. About 1%–4% of people with typhoid fever become chronic carriers and remain positive for Salmonella Typhi for more than one year.

### The temporal dynamics of humoral immunity to Rickettsia typhi infection in murine typhus patients [^43c3a381]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2020). Medium credibility.

The IFA has become the default reference standard serological assay for murine typhus since its description in 1959; however, there has been minimal investigation or discussion justifying the use of diagnostic cut-offs. Here we have determined the IFA cut-off reciprocal titre to provide an evidence-base for the diagnosis of murine typhus in the endemic setting of Vientiane, Lao PDR. Using a Bayesian latent class model approach, we selected the optimal IFA cut-off reciprocal titre of 800 for IgM with a resultant sensitivity of 78.6% and a specificity of 89.9%. For IgG, the sensitivity and specificity using an IFA cut-off reciprocal titre of 1600 were 77.3% and 99.5%, respectively. Murine typhus studies in Asia have inconsistently applied diagnostic cut-offs for when using the IFA (see Supplementary material, Table S1). IFA cut-off reciprocal titres from previous studies for IgM ranged from ≥ 64 to 400 and for IgG ranged from ≥ 128 to ≥ 400. Whole antibody (IgM and IgG) was consistently applied at ≥ 400 in reported studies. In Lao PDR, previous studies have used cut-offs of ≥ 64 or ≥ 400 for IgM and ≥ 128 for IgG with or without a ≥ 4-fold dynamic rise between sample collections. A dynamic rise in titre between paired samples was also regarded as indicative of an active infection. However, some studies indicated a minimum titre (up to 200 in the latter sample) or IgG only (see Supplementary material, Table S1). In areas where murine typhus is endemic, the issue of residual antibodies from previous infections causes difficulty when performing diagnosis of acute disease using serological methods. The prevalence of anti- R. typhi IgG antibodies in Vientiane was 20.6% in healthy individuals, demonstrating an issue with residual antibodies. However, selection of cut-off titres remains controversial and tends to be dependent on the seroprevalence in the population (see Supplementary material, Table S1).

Estimation of diagnostic cut-offs

The optimal admission sample diagnostic cut-offs were determined using Bayesian latent class models (Table 2). An admission IFA IgM of ≥ 3200 had the lowest sensitivity of 41.4% (95% CI 35.8%–50.8%) followed by 55.7% (95% CI 48.1%–67.2%), 78.6% (95% CI 71.6%–85.2%) and 88.9% (95% CI 85.4%–91.1%) for IgM of 1600, 800 and < 400, respectively. Optimal specificity of 99% (95% CI 100%–100%) was in the range of ≥ 3200 and 1600 that decreased to 89.9% (95% CI 62.5%–100%) at 800. Similar to IgM, an IgG admission IFA of ≥ 3200 had the lowest sensitivity of 53.4% (95% CI 47%–60.6%) followed by 77.3% (95% CI 68.2%–87.6%), 87.5% (95% CI 84.7%–90.1%) and 91.4% (95% CI 88.8%–92.7%) for IgG of 1600, 800 and < 400, respectively. Both IFA IgG of ≥ 3200 and 1600 had the highest specificity of 99% (95% CI 95%–100%), followed by 70.5% (95% CI 38.8%–100%) and 58.6% (95% CI 26%–100%) for the IgG of 800 and < 400, respectively. Balancing the requirements for optimal sensitivity and specificity, we recommend a diagnostic cut-off of 800 for IgM and 1600 for IgG.

### Clinical overview of epidemic typhus… [^600aa56c]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- The primary vector of epidemic typhus is the human body louse, with transmission occurring through contact with infected lice feces.
- Epidemic typhus outbreaks are often linked to densely populated environments in situations with limited access to hygienic services.
- Symptoms include fever, headache, rash, and altered mental status. Laboratory confirmation is typically based on serological tests detecting IgG or IgM antibodies.
- Early treatment with doxycycline is crucial to prevent severe complications. Laboratory confirmation R. prowazekii can be detected via indirect fluorescent antibody test, immunohistochemistry, polymerase chain reaction assay of blood, plasma, or tissue samples, or culture isolation. Serologic tests are the most common means of confirmation and can be used to detect either IgG or IgM antibodies. Diagnosis is typically confirmed by documenting a four-fold rise in antibody titer between acute and convalescent samples.

Acute specimens are taken during the first week of illness and convalescent samples are taken 2–10 weeks later. Detectable levels of IgG or IgM antibodies generally do not appear until 7–10 days after the onset of illness. Because IgG antibody titers may persist in some individuals for years after the original exposure, only demonstration of recent changes in titers between paired specimens can be considered reliable serological confirmation of an acute epidemic typhus infection. R. prowazekii antigens may cross react with those of R. typhi, and occasionally with R. rickettsii. Persons with Brill-Zinsser disease generally show a rise in IgG but not IgM antibodies to R. prowazekii. IHC can be used to detect infection with typhus group Rickettsia in formalin-fixed tissue samples. PCR of whole blood or tissue can distinguish between infection with R. typhi and R.

prowazekii although the sensitivity of these assays vary considerably based on the sample type, timing of sample collection, and the severity of disease. Since epidemic typhus is not common in the United States, testing is not typically available at state and local health departments. Serologic and molecular tests can be performed at the CDC, through submission from state health departments.

### An evaluation of purified Salmonella typhi protein antigens for the serological diagnosis of acute typhoid fever [^734aa99c]. The Journal of Infection (2017). Low credibility.

Objectives

The diagnosis of typhoid fever is a challenge. Aiming to develop a typhoid diagnostic we measured antibody responses against Salmonella Typhi (S. Typhi) protein antigens and the Vi polysaccharide in a cohort of Bangladeshi febrile patients.

Methods

IgM against 12 purified antigens and the Vi polysaccharide was measured by ELISA in plasma from patients with confirmed typhoid fever (n = 32), other confirmed infections (n = 17), and healthy controls (n = 40). ELISAs with the most specific antigens were performed on plasma from 243 patients with undiagnosed febrile disease.

Results

IgM against the S. Typhi protein antigens correlated with each other (rho > 0.8), but not against Vi (rho < 0.6). Typhoid patients exhibited higher IgM against 11/12 protein antigens and Vi than healthy controls and those with other infections. Vi, PilL, and CdtB exhibited the greatest sensitivity and specificity. Specificity and sensitivity was improved when Vi was combined with a protein antigen, generating sensitivities and specificities of 0.80 and > 0.85, respectively. Applying a dynamic cut-off to patients with undiagnosed febrile disease suggested that 34–58% had an IgM response indicative of typhoid.

Conclusions

We evaluated the diagnostic potential of several S. Typhi antigens; our assays give good sensitivity and specificity, but require further assessment in differing patient populations.

Typhoid and paratyphoid fever — rapid tests and clinical diagnosis note that several commercial rapid diagnostic tests are available but their sensitivity and specificity are not optimal; the Widal test is unreliable yet widely used because of low cost; serologic tests do not distinguish acute from past infection or vaccination and lack specificity so blood culture remains the preferred method to diagnose acute infections; because of poor sensitivity and specificity of rapid antibody tests and the time to obtain a positive culture, the initial diagnosis must often be made clinically; typhoid and paratyphoid fever are clinically indistinguishable, and the combination of risk factors with gradual onset of fever increasing in severity over several days should raise suspicion of enteric fever.

### Estimating the seroincidence of scrub typhus using antibody dynamics after infection [^298b4192]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2024). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Scrub typhus, an acute febrile illness caused by the bacterium Orientia tsutsugamushi, is an important, underrecognized etiology of fever. Once thought to be restricted to the "tsutsugamushi triangle", a region spanning from Russia to Pakistan, Australia, and Japan, recent studies have identified scrub typhus transmission in South America, Africa, and the Middle East. – Infections occur when trombiculid mite chiggers (larvae) enter a host's skin through hair follicles and feed on lysed skin tissue. The mites, both vectors and reservoirs of O. tsutsugamushi, feed on various mammals, including humans and rodents.

In humans, symptoms are nonspecific and include fever, myalgia, headache, gastrointestinal symptoms, and rash. An eschar is a specific indicator of infection but is easily missed on clinical examination and may not always be present. Although infection can be effectively treated with antibiotics, when treatment is delayed, it can spread to organs and become severe, with case fatality rates reaching 12–13%.

Indirect immunofluorescence assays (IFAs) have been the mainstay of scrub typhus diagnostics for decades. Standardized criteria for diagnosing scrub typhus involve either an acute IgM IFA titer of 1:3,200 or a 4-fold increase to at least 1:3,200 between acute- and convalescent-phase samples. The IFA method, requiring specialized equipment, skilled personnel, and both acute- and convalescent-phase samples, presents significant challenges, especially in low-resource settings, limiting its feasibility for routine diagnostics and surveillance. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) have demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity and are more logistically feasible, positioning them as a more practical alternative to IFAs. InBios manufactures a commercially available IgM and IgG ELISA kit for scrub typhus that uses a recombinant p56-kDa type-specific antigen. When compared with IFA, the InBios IgM ELISA with a screening cutoff of 0.6 had a sensitivity of 84.2% and a specificity of 98.3% among patients presenting between 5 and 11 days after fever onset.

### Redefining typhoid diagnosis: what would an improved test need to look like? [^d5413a4e]. BMJ Global Health (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Typhoid fever is one of the most common bacterial causes of acute febrile illness in the developing world, with an estimated 10.9million new cases and 116.8 thousand deaths in 2017. Typhoid point-of-care (POC) diagnostic tests are widely used but have poor sensitivity and specificity, resulting in antibiotic overuse that has led to the emergence and spread of multidrug-resistant strains. With recent advances in typhoid surveillance and detection, this is the ideal time to produce a target product profile (TPP) that guides product development and ensure that a next-generation test meets the needs of users in the resource-limited settings where typhoid is endemic.

Methods

A structured literature review was conducted to develop a draft TPP for a next-generation typhoid diagnostic test with minimal and optimal desired characteristics for 36 test parameters. The TPP was refined using feedback collected from a Delphi survey of key stakeholders in clinical medicine, microbiology, diagnostics and public and global health.

Results

A next-generation typhoid diagnostic test should improve patient management through the diagnosis and treatment of infection with acute Salmonella enterica serovars Typhi or Paratyphi with a sensitivity ≥ 90%and specificity ≥ 95%. The test would ideally be used at the lowest level of the healthcare system in settings without a reliable power or water supply and provide results in < 15min at a cost of < US$1.00.

Conclusion

This report outlines the first comprehensive TPP for typhoid fever and is intended to guide the development of a next-generation typhoid diagnostic test. An accurate POC test will reduce the morbidity and mortality of typhoid fever through rapid diagnosis and treatment and will have the greatest impact in reducing antimicrobial resistance if it is combined with diagnostics for other causes of acute febrile illness in a treatment algorithm.

Preferred diagnostic and treatment strategies for scrub typhus

Serological tests and molecular assays are primary laboratory procedures for diagnosing scrub typhus. As per the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) is the reference standard, though it is rarely available in developing nations where prevalence is high. Immunochromatographic tests (ICTs) using either pooled cell lysates from various strains of O. tsutsugamushi or recombinant p56 or other outer membrane proteins as the antigen provide better sensitivity and specificity and may eventually replace the IFA. ICTs detect IgG, IgM and IgA antibodies against O. tsutsugamushi with moderate sensitivity (~70%). Sensitivity increases with fever duration but has a substantial number of false negative results. PCRs usually target the genes of outer membrane proteins. They may be more sensitive than serological tests detecting Orientia DNA in blood even during persistent phases of infection with no obvious clinical symptoms. While providing a cheap option for identifying rickettsial infections in resource-poor settings, the Weil-Felix agglutination test has poor sensitivity (~15%) and specificity (~96%) and is thus not preferred.

Historically, scrub typhus has been treated with chloramphenicol. However, its use in pregnant women and infants is fraught with complications, due to which it is avoided in pregnancy and not prescribed to neonates. At the same time, tetracycline is contraindicated during pregnancy due to teratogenicity, and it can discolour children's teeth. Doxycycline (a tetracycline derivative) was initially contraindicated in children but is now deemed reasonably safe in children under eight, particularly in life-threatening cases. The macrolide azithromycin is effective in penetrating polymorphonuclear leucocytes and macrophages, the target cells of O. tsutsugamushi and is also deemed safe for use in pregnant women and young children.

### Optimal cutoff titers for indirect immunofluorescence assay for diagnosis of scrub typhus [^048900e8]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2015). Low credibility.

In this study, we used an unbiased Bayesian LCM approach and defined optimal cutoff titers for IFA IgM as either ≥ 1:3,200 in an admission samples or as a ≥ 4-fold rise to ≥ 1:3,200 in a convalescent-phase sample. With these new cutoff titers, the sensitivity and specificity of the IFA IgM is 81.6% and 100%, respectively, indicating that they can be used to diagnose scrub typhus with high confidence in clinical and research settings. The low specificity caused by the low cutoff titers of IFA IgM could be due to cross-reactivity of the IFA IgM with infections caused by other organisms in our setting, and this is also likely to occur in other tropical countries. Although Brown et al. reported a high specificity for the IFA IgM using the conventional cutoff in the convalescent-phase sample, the median duration between the admission sample and the convalescent-phase sample in non-scrub typhus control patients in his study was unknown. Based on our findings, the capping titer for IFA IgM in our setting could be ≥ 1:6,400 so that it can diagnose acute scrub typhus in a patient who presents with IFA IgM 1:1,600 on admission with a 4-fold rise to ≥ 1:6,400 in a convalescent-phase sample. As the accuracy and cost-benefit of diagnostic tests could vary based on prevalence, clinical variability, and availability and timing of convalescent-phase samples, further studies to evaluate optimal cutoff titers, accuracy, and benefits of IFA IgM in different settings are still required.

The biased selection of cutoff titers is a common problem affecting many serological tests for tropical infectious diseases because the reference tests are rarely, if ever, perfect. In addition, many serological tests for tropical infectious diseases, including the scrub typhus IFA IgM, are still based on the judgement of readers; therefore, these tests remain inherently subjective. Future development of new serological diagnostic tests for tropical infectious diseases should be based on methodologies with objective readouts such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and the optimal cutoffs in admission and convalescent-phase samples should be selected based on appropriate statistical models.

### Selection of diagnostic cutoffs for murine typhus IgM and IgG immunofluorescence assay: a systematic review [^d3cba603]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Medium credibility.

Many studies used identical cutoffs for IgG and IgM (26.9%, 21/78), despite the fact that dynamics of the antibody isotypes differ. This should be considered when interpreting test results, as generally on infection, an increase in IgM is seen, followed by increased levels of IgG.

A variety of factors may affect the diagnostic accuracy of IFAs, including the antibody isotype targeted. Differences in IFA single-titer cutoffs were observed in studies where either IgM or IgG were targeted or both IgM and IgG were targeted to apparently increase the accuracy of the test. In general, higher single-titer cutoffs were used for IgG over IgM, whereas no consensus was seen for studies targeting IgM and IgG together (Table 4).

Considering study populations, the use of samples from infected or normal patients and the geographic origin of the patients can influence the consequent diagnostic cutoff. Murine typhus is an important travel-related illness, and in a few studies, serum samples were collected from various geographic locations, such as Peru, Russia, United States, and Somalia, although there was ambiguity with regard to whether the cutoff was applied to a single population or whether the cutoff was calculated through results from all the populations despite dissimilarities in endemicity. This emphasizes the complexity surrounding murine typhus serology and the lack of consensus. From the data shown here, no single antibody titer can accurately be advised as diagnostic unless preexistent studies have been performed to establish seroprevalence levels in the normal population within a location.

### Optimal cutoff and accuracy of an IgM enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for diagnosis of acute scrub typhus in Northern Thailand: an alternative reference method to the IgM immunofluorescence assay [^58854593]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2016). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

We have described an unbiased approach using Bayesian LCMs to define optimal sample dilution and optimal cutoff OD values for the use of an IgM ELISA for the diagnosis of acute scrub typhus. We demonstrated that the sensitivity and specificity of the IgM ELISA are comparable to those of the IgM IFA with a cutoff of ≥ 1:3,200 in admission samples or a 4-fold rise to ≥ 1:3,200 in convalescent/discharge samples compared to admission samples and suggest that the IgM ELISA could be used as an alternative serological reference test instead of the IgM IFA.

In addition to comparable accuracy, there are a number of other reasons why ELISA technologies could replace IFA as the scrub typhus reference serological test. In general, the IFA is a subjective semiquantitative test that requires highly trained operators to prepare the slides and determine the results. Furthermore, the IFA does not lend itself to the testing of large numbers of samples, hindering throughput when performing clinical studies or in clinical settings with large numbers of patients. These problems could easily be overcome by the ELISA, which could be automated and is easier to standardize, as it provides fully quantitative and consistent results.

### Serology of typhoid fever in an area of endemicity and its relevance to diagnosis [^86df7c21]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2001). Low credibility.

Currently, the laboratory diagnosis of typhoid fever is dependent upon either the isolation of Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serotype Typhi from a clinical sample or the detection of raised titers of agglutinating serum antibodies against the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (O) or flagellum (H) antigens of serotype Typhi (the Widal test). In this study, the serum antibody responses to the LPS and flagellum antigens of serotype Typhi were investigated with individuals from a region of Vietnam in which typhoid is endemic, and their usefulness for the diagnosis of typhoid fever was evaluated. The antibody responses to both antigens were highly variable among individuals infected with serotype Typhi, and elevated antibody titers were also detected in a high proportion of serum samples from healthy subjects from the community. In-house enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) for the detection of specific classes of anti-LPS and antiflagellum antibodies were compared with other serologically based tests for the diagnosis of typhoid fever (Widal TO and TH, anti-serotype Typhi immunoglobulin M [IgM] dipstick, and IDeaL TUBEX). At a specificity of ≥ 0.93, the sensitivities of the different tests were 0.75, 0.55, and 0.52 for the anti-LPS IgM, IgG, and IgA ELISAs, respectively; 0.28 for the antiflagellum IgG ELISA; 0.47 and 0.32 for the Widal TO and TH tests, respectively; and 0.77 for the anti-serotype Typhi IgM dipstick assay. The specificity of the IDeaL TUBEX was below 0.90 (sensitivity, 0.87; specificity, 0.76). The serological assays based on the detection of IgM antibodies against either serotype Typhi LPS (ELISA) or whole bacteria (dipstick) had a significantly higher sensitivity than the Widal TO test when used with a single acute-phase serum sample (P ≤ 0.007). These tests could be of use for the diagnosis of typhoid fever in patients who have clinical typhoid fever but are culture negative or in regions where bacterial culturing facilities are not available.

### Selection of diagnostic cutoffs for murine typhus IgM and IgG immunofluorescence assay: a systematic review [^ba7c7485]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

To classify confirmed cases and to ensure appropriate patient management, the application of accurate diagnostic cutoffs is necessary for murine typhus. This review has found that there was a major lack of consensus regarding methodologies, application, and IFA/IIP positivity cutoffs used for the diagnosis of murine typhus infections; the reasons for which are manifold and need further investigation and standardization.

In many cases (57.7%, 45/78), a clear justification for the cutoff used was not provided, and it is likely that differences in approach evolved naturally based on local antigenic strains and the pretest odds of disease depending on the local level of murine typhus endemicity. This variation raises questions about which, if any, IFA positivity cutoff is most appropriate for the diagnosis of acute murine typhus infection.

Of the five diagnostic accuracy studies, the majority (60%, 3/5) provided sufficient justification for the positivity cutoff titer used. Although there was a lack of consensus in terms of the source used for the reference test, a single positivity cutoff titer of ≥ 1:400 in Lao PDR and ≥ 1:128 in South America was common (Table 2). This is probably an appropriate estimation for certain parts of Lao PDR and South America, with limited application in other geographic locations. As has been previously established, it is also likely that these cutoffs are not befitting for the locations in which they were being used.

La Scola et al.were most commonly cited as a justification for IFA and IIP diagnostic cutoffs for the diagnosis of R. typhi. The study also suggests that although the IFA is an appropriate diagnostic method in the case of acute infections, it should be "considered a technique for seroepidemiology only in areas where the seroprevalence of the rickettsial disease has already been established". The article emphasizes that the cutoff should be specific for "each rickettsial disease and each area".

### Etiological spectrum of persistent fever in the tropics and predictors of ubiquitous infections: a prospective four-country study with pooled analysis [^4a259f06]. BMC Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

The NIDIAG study on persistent fever had several strengths. We deployed extensive, systematic, and quality-assured testing at the point of care in varied and/or remote settings and included a large cohort of patients. Reference standard testing was pre-specified by experts and uniformly applied. Recruitment was conducted in several tropical countries and in varied settings, including outpatient clinics and referral hospitals, making our findings broadly applicable. The study population was also heterogeneous in age, gender, and presence of comorbidity, with no particular group specifically excluded (except children < 5 years), somehow reflecting the complex nature of the real life clinical practice. Finally, the multicentric design allowed a more robust search for predictors by grouping all ubiquitous priority infections that were found at rather low frequency in each study site.

However, the present study must be interpreted in its context. First, while the approach of the targeted infections was robust and standardized between study sites, diagnostic platforms for all other diseases were basic, and biochemistry and hematology were not harmonized. This left much uncertainty regarding the diagnosis of all other conditions, and this resulted in a large proportion of unknown etiologies, in fact rather similar to what is observed in most AFI studies. Second, the methods to diagnose some conditions under study may be considered as imperfect reference standards, since they all have notorious limitations both in sensitivity and clinical specificity. For example, sensitivity of a single blood culture for diagnosing enteric fever is 60% at best, tends to decrease in the second week of fever, and is impaired by any prior empiric antibiotic treatment. PCR assays targeting leptospirosis in serum and/or urine have an overall sensitivity of 70%, varying in the course of the infection and possibly lower in the second week of the illness. Detection of rickettsial DNA by PCR in blood/serum is transient and sensitivity may be as low as 18% for murine typhus. Paired serology on acute and convalescent sera could not be performed in about 25% of the cases who did not come back for follow-up. Besides this possibility of false-negative results, there is also an issue of false-positive results. Indeed, attributing a fever episode to the presence of a pathogen is not always appropriate, as is well known for the presence of malaria parasites in blood smears in hyperendemic areas like the DRC. Similarly, a few case-control studies investigating the etiologies of AFI have demonstrated that some individuals may be carriers of Leptospira or Rickettsia spp. pathogens (as detected by PCR) without presenting any symptom. The absence of controls in our study did not allow to fully apprehend the status of infection versus disease, despite strict case ascertainment. Finally, the substantial mortality rate of persistent fever is likely underestimated since a sizeable proportion of participants were lost to follow-up and the most severe cases at presentation were not included in this study.

### Evaluation of the diagnostic accuracy of antibody assays for patients with scrub typhus [^218f233a]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2021). Medium credibility.

This study was carried out to evaluate the accuracy of various antibody tests for scrub typhus, namely, the indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) from the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) and four commercial kits (companies A to D). The test accuracy was based on the diagnosis of scrub typhus, as defined by a positive PCR or culture. In total, serum samples from 97 patients with scrub typhus and 200 non-scrub typhus patients were tested. The respective sensitivity and specificity of each test were as follows. For the KCDC IFA, sensitivity and specificity were 55.7% (95% confidence interval [CI] 45.2 to 65.8%) and 94.8% (95% CI, 90.4 to 97.3%) for IgM and 42.3% (95% CI, 32.3 to 52.7%) and 96.3% (95% CI, 92.6 to 98.5%) for IgG, with diagnostic cutoffs of ≥ 1:16 for IgM and ≥ 1:256 for IgG. For kit A, the sensitivity and specificity were 70.1% (95% CI, 59.8 to 78.8%) and 74.6% (95% CI, 67.6 to 80.6%) for total immunoglobulins, with a cutoff of ≥ 1:40. For kit B, the sensitivity and specificity were 64.3% (95% CI, 51.9 to 75.1%) and 94.9% (95% CI, 81.4 to 99.1%) for IgM and 67.1% (95% CI, 54.8 to 77.6%) and 74.4% (95% CI, 57.6 to 86.4%) for IgG. For kit C, the sensitivity and specificity were 53.6% (95% CI, 43.2 to 63.7%) and 99.5% (95% CI, 96.8 to 100%) for IgM and 36.1% (95% CI, 26.8 to 46.5%) and 100% (95% CI, 97.6 to 100%) for IgG. For kit D, the sensitivity and specificity were 73.2% (95% CI, 63.1 to 81.4%) and 89.5% (95% CI, 84.2 to 93.2%) for total immunoglobulins. These results are all unsatisfactory, highlighting an urgent need for the development of more highly sensitive and specific tests.

### The temporal dynamics of humoral immunity to Rickettsia typhi infection in murine typhus patients [^7b23ff8e]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2020). Medium credibility.

Results presented from this study will inform diagnostic laboratories in Lao PDR and other settings where murine typhus is endemic regarding locally appropriate diagnostic cut-offs and will underline the diagnostic problems with antibody persistence following acute infection. It is expected that the diagnostic cut-offs calculated here will be adopted nationally in Lao PDR. Further prospective studies are needed to validate these and to define cut-offs in other geographically diverse locations. Until the studies have been performed, any diagnostic interpretations should be made with caution, especially for travellers from non-endemic regions.

### An evaluation of purified Salmonella typhi protein antigens for the serological diagnosis of acute typhoid fever [^f8f864f2]. The Journal of Infection (2017). Low credibility.

Our study focused on a well-defined patient group from Bangladesh, who were enrolled for the primary focus of studying typhoid diagnostics. Whilst the patient numbers with typhoid in this group were relatively modest, the clinical and laboratory criteria for patients with febrile disease were consistent and have been previously assessed with commercial serological tests for typhoid. We noted that the IgM response against the twelve purified S. Typhi protein antigens were stable and well correlated; the IgM responses in comparison to Vi correlated less consistently. These data confirm our original antigen screening data and suggest that these antigens are immunogenic and induce an antibody response early in infection. Given the poor performance of commercial RDTs, our data signify that the early detection of IgM against more specific S. Typhi protein antigens may be a more specific and sensitive approach for developing a RDT for typhoid.

### Optimal cutoff and accuracy of an IgM enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for diagnosis of acute scrub typhus in Northern Thailand: an alternative reference method to the IgM immunofluorescence assay [^b79f31ed]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2016). Low credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Scrub typhus and murine typhus are important causes of acute febrile illness in Thailand and Laos. Diagnosis of scrub typhus still relies on serology due to the convenience of sample collection; the relative simplicity of the assays; and the expense, complexities, and deficiencies in sensitivity of other modalities. The indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) is the serological reference standard despite being inconsistent in terms of antigen composition, diagnostic cutoff, and repeatability. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) offer a number of advantages over IFA, particularly in terms of simplicity, reading objectivity, and sample throughput. Use of ELISA for acute scrub typhus diagnosis has been previously evaluated; however, its optimal sample dilution and cutoff optical density (OD) have not been determined.

Defining the cutoff value of a new serological test is conventionally done by comparing the results of the serological test of interest with the results of a reference test. However, this conventional approach assumes that the reference test has perfect sensitivity and specificity; if this is not the case, then estimates of sensitivity and specificity for the test under evaluation will be biased and the selected cutoff value suboptimal. Bayesian latent class models (LCMs) are increasingly used to determine the optimal cutoff value and to estimate the accuracy of a diagnostic test, since they do not need to assume that the accuracy of reference tests is perfect. We recently used Bayesian LCMs to reanalyze our existing data set from a previously published prospective study and showed that an IgM IFA with a cutoff titer of ≥ 1:12,800 in admission samples or a 4-fold rise to ≥ 1:200 in convalescent/discharge samples had low sensitivity and specificity (70.0% and 83.8%, respectively) and that optimal cutoff titers for IgM IFA of ≥ 1:3,200 in admission specimens or a ≥ 4-fold rise to ≥ 1:3,200 in convalescent/discharge specimens provided higher sensitivity and specificity (81.6% and 100%, respectively).

In this study, we used Bayesian LCMs and blood samples collected from our previously published prospective study to systematically determine the optimal sample dilution and optimal cutoff OD and to examine the accuracy of the Naval Medical Research Center (NMRC) "in-house" scrub typhus IgM ELISA.

### The temporal dynamics of humoral immunity to Rickettsia typhi infection in murine typhus patients [^d15f8789]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

This study examined individuals with Rickettsia typhi infection in the Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) to (a) investigate humoral immune dynamics; (b) determine the differences in reference diagnostic results and recommend appropriate cut-offs; (c) determine differences in immune response after different antibiotic treatments; and (d) determine appropriate diagnostic cut-off parameters for indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA).

Methods

Sequential serum samples from 90 non-pregnant, adults were collected at seven time-points (days 0, 7, 14, 28, 90, 180 and 365) as part of a clinical antibiotic treatment trial. Samples were tested using IFA to determine IgM and IgG antibody reciprocal end-point titres against R. typhi and PCR.

Results

For all 90 individuals, reciprocal R. typhi IgM and IgG antibody titres ranged from < 400 to ≥ 3200. The median half-life of R. typhi IgM was 126 days (interquartile range 36–204 days) and IgG was 177 days (interquartile range 134–355 days). Overall median patient titres for R. typhi IgM and IgG were significantly different (p < 0.0001) and at each temporal sample collection point (range p < 0.0001 to p 0.0411). Using Bayesian latent class model analysis, the optimal diagnostic cut-off reciprocal IFA titer on patient admission for IgM was 800 (78.6%, 95% CI 71.6%–85.2% sensitivity; 89.9%, 95% CI 62.5%–100% specificity), and for IFA IgG 1600 (77.3%; 95% CI 68.2%–87.6% sensitivity; 99%, 95% CI 95%–100% specificity).

Conclusions

This study suggests suitable diagnostic cut-offs for local diagnostic laboratories and other endemic settings and highlights antibody persistence following acute infection. Further studies are required to validate and define cut-offs in other geographically diverse locations.

### Loop-mediated isothermal amplification for Rickettsia typhi (the causal agent of murine typhus): problems with diagnosis at the limit of detection [^42101435]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2014). Low credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Murine typhus, an acute febrile illness with worldwide distribution, is increasingly recognized as an important cause of fever. The agent, is transmitted to humans by flea bites and/or by self-inoculation, from scratching of flea feces on the human skin. Murine typhus and scrub typhus, caused by, are important causes of fever in Southeast Asia and represent up to 28% of blood culture-negative febrile cases in Lao and adjoining countries.

The laboratory diagnosis of murine typhus is conventionally based on the indirect immunofluorescent assay (IFA) using paired serum samples. However, IFA is hampered by subjectivity of result interpretation and a lack of evidence-based interpretation guidelines in areas of endemicity where substantial background antibody levels confuse the interpretation of results, making single readings unreliable. A 4-fold titer increase in paired samples is an accepted diagnostic positivity criterion but remains retrospective by nature and may result in delayed antibiotic treatment. A clinically useful diagnostic test should enable early, sensitive, and specific detection of, preferably at the point of care (POC). Cell culture confirms the presence ofwith high specificity but with low sensitivity. Direct antigen- or DNA-based detection methods offer new, more specific diagnostic targets than serology assays. Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) assays can improve early diagnosis of rickettsial infections and, when combined with serological tests, expand the time frame of adequate diagnostic coverage.

Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) is a practical and inexpensive methodology in comparison to related PCR methods and does not require a thermocycler. These advantages make LAMP a strong contender for fulfilling the World Health Organization ASSURED criteria (a ffordable, s ensitive, s pecific, u ser friendly, r obust and rapid, e quipment free, d eliverable to those who need them). Recent technological developments have led to major improvements, such as advanced heating devices, optimized and simplified extraction technologies, and innovative methods for endpoint interpretation.

We therefore aimed to develop a LAMP assay and examine its diagnostic accuracy in relation to bacteria load for the early detection of. If LAMP is of sufficient diagnostic accuracy, it may serve as a POC assay in central and peripheral health facilities to aid timely identification of murine typhus patients.

### Redefining typhoid diagnosis: what would an improved test need to look like? [^39770512]. BMJ Global Health (2019). High credibility.

The 2017 Global Burden of Disease study estimated that S. Paratyphi affected 3.4 million people annually, with 19.1 thousand deaths, compared with 10.9 million cases and 116.8 thousand deaths for S. Typhi. The higher morbidity and mortality of S. Typhi makes it a greater public health concern, but the increasing prevalence of S. Paratyphi in certain regions makes it prudent for a next-generation test to detect S. Paratyphi as well as S. Typhi. Delphi survey feedback noted that not being able to detect S. Paratyphi could undermine clinician confidence in a next-generation typhoid POC test as S. Typhi and S. Paratyphi may cause indistinguishable clinical syndromes. As drug-resistant typhoid continues to spread, it may become necessary to differentiate between these two serovars prior to starting therapy due to different antibiotic susceptibility profiles.

The minimum diagnostic requirement for a typhoid RDT in this TPP was ≥ 90% sensitivity and ≥ 95% specificity, with an optimum threshold of ≥ 95% sensitivity and ≥ 98% specificity. Consensus agreement was achieved in the Delphi survey for specificity but not sensitivity, reflecting the substantial variability seen in the published literature with proposed targets ranging from 80%–90% for sensitivity and 90%–98% for specificity. The poor sensitivity of blood culture as a reference standard for typhoid diagnosis makes it difficult to accurately assess the performance of novel diagnostic tests. Diagnostic accuracy can be improved by reliably identifying alternative infections and by using a CRS that incorporates the results of multiple tests.CRSs that have been used for typhoid diagnosis include culture and/or clinical findings; culture and/or Widal test; culture and/or PCR; culture, Widal test and/or clinical finding; and culture, PCR and/or Widal test. Evaluation of CRSs has been limited by a lack of consistency between studies, with a systematic review identifying 21 studies that stated use of a CRS as the reference method for a typhoid diagnostic test, but no 2 studies utilised an identical CRS. For a CRS to be reproducible, it has been proposed that the individual test components need to be standardised, with clinical signs that match the WHO definition of suspected typhoid fever, assays that are commercially available and well-defined blood culture parameters. Further work is needed to identify a standardised CRS before it can be included in a typhoid TPP.

### Determination of optimal diagnostic cut-offs for the naval medical research center scrub typhus IgM ELISA in chiang rai, Thailand [^2e20e9d0]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2019). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Scrub typhus is a major cause of acute febrile illness in the Asia-Pacific region, accounting for up to 20–50% of febrile hospital admissions in endemic areas. – Orientia tsutsugamushi, the causative agent in the region, is transmitted to humans through the bite of the larval stage of infected chigger mites. Clinical manifestations commonly observed include fever, eschar, rash, headache, myalgia, malaise, and regional lymphadenopathy. If left untreated, the disease may progress to multi-organ failure and death. With the exception of the eschar, scrub typhus is difficult to differentiate clinically from other febrile illnesses such as dengue, murine typhus, or leptospirosis. If diagnostic facilities are available, serological or molecular tests can be performed to enhance the clinical diagnosis, but both diagnostic methods have inherent weaknesses.

The indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) historically has been considered the gold standard for laboratory diagnosis of scrub typhus. However, its application is limited in rural areas — where scrub typhus is especially prevalent — because of the level of technical expertise and infrastructure required.– The ELISA is a more objective and convenient test to perform. Furthermore, it has been shown to be even more sensitive than the IFA. Other methods of laboratory diagnosis include PCR and in vitro isolation of O. tsutsugamushi — neither of which are feasible in resource-limited areas. Although a positive culture is confirmation of an infection, it is a laborious task that necessitates a biosafety level 3 facility. Moreover, it has been reported that the median time for detection of O. tsutsugamushi is 27 days. An indicative necrotic lesion known as an eschar is very useful at the time of disease presentation up until the lesion has completely healed for diagnosis (approximately 2 weeks), but its presence varies from 7% to 80% of cases.

### Accuracy of rapid IgM-based immunochromatographic and immunoblot assays for diagnosis of acute scrub typhus and murine typhus infections in Laos [^40390c2a]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2010). Low credibility.

Figure 1.
Proportional positivity for the scrub typhus immunochromatograpic test and the murine typhus immunoblot test for detection of IgM compared with the gold standard IgM indirect immunofluorescent antibody assay.

3) What is the effect of cross-reactivity between antibodies to O. tsutsugamushi and R. typhi on the diagnostic utility of ST ICT and MT IBT compared with gold standard IFA assays for antibodies against O. tsutsugamushi and R. typhi?

We investigated the utility of the ST ICT and MT IBT to detect heterologous antibodies for detection of both typhus diseases. Cross-reactivity in the MT IBT for detection of antibodies to scrub typhus ranged from 16.7% to 17.8% depending on the diagnostic criteria used (Table 2). When we used the stringent four-fold increasing diagnostic criteria, of 101 samples indicating scrub typhus, 17.8% (95% CI = 11.6–26.4%) showed a positive reaction in the MT IBT. The ST ICT was marginally more specific than the MT IBT; murine typhus antibody cross-reactivity ranging from 9.8% to 15.9% depending on the diagnostic criteria used (Table 2). When we used the stringent four-fold increasing diagnostic criteria, of 183 samples indicating murine typhus, 9.8% (95% CI = 6.3–15.1%) showed a positive reaction in the ST ICT. There was no significant difference in cross-reactivity between the two assays when the diagnostic criteria were used.

4) What is the effect of sample timing, in relation to the duration of illness, on the ST ICT and MT IBT positivity rates for IgM against O. tsutsugamushi and R. typhi IFA assay-positive patients?

Rapid test positivity rates for the three reference diagnostic criteria were largely constant with increasing days of illness for both rapid tests until day 10 or 12 of fever when there was a marked increase in positivity (Figure 2). The ST ICT positivity rates remained at < 50% from day 1 to day 10 of illness when there was an increase to approximately 60% positivity (Figure 2A). The MT IBT maintained a positivity range of 40–60% from day 1 to day 12, followed by an increase to approximately between 60% and 80% positivity (Figure 2B).

### Rickettsioses as underrecognized cause of hospitalization for febrile illness, Uganda [^6dbf9c9e]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Rickettsial infections are challenging to clinically distinguish from other causes of febrile illness. Clinical, operational, and technical factors increase the difficulty of identifying rickettsioses in sub-Saharan Africa. Rickettsial infections in sub-Saharan Africa are of international importance; among returning travelers from the region, rickettsioses are common causes of nonmalarial fever. Many patients do not have an obvious eschar, and clinical signs and symptoms are not well-characterized among those hospitalized in the region. Characteristic laboratory abnormalities of thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and elevated transaminase activities are commonly observed clinical manifestations of the most prevalent tropical infections, including malaria, typhoid fever, arboviruses, or generalized sepsis.

Clinicians do not have reliable diagnostics for acute rickettsioses. Empiric antimicrobial drug regimens rarely include antimicrobial drugs active against rickettsioses (e.g. tetracyclines). Diagnostics are generally limited to acute- and convalescent-phase serology despite flaws in performance, sparse point-of-care availability, and almost absent acute care clinical utility. Because of the low organism concentration within the bloodstream in acute infection, serum or whole blood PCR is generally insensitive at 18%. rRNA, on the other hand, is highly abundant, conserved, and stable. Targeting rRNA with reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) is an approach that has been used to optimize analytical sensitivity in PCRs for rickettsial and other low bacterial burden infections. Evaluations using archived samples from patients with rickettsioses and nonrickettsial diseases demonstrate real promise for improved detection sensitivity of rickettsial infections but have yet to be evaluated in samples from prospectively identified acute febrile illnesses in a comprehensive clinical study. To confirm the improved sensitivity of this approach, we developed and evaluated new primers targeting rRNA. We describe the performance of an rRNA-targeting RT-PCR to detect spotted fever group (SFG) rickettsiae and typhus group (TG) rickettsiae, compared with acute- and convalescent-phase immunofluorescence assays (IFA), among acute febrile hospitalized participants in 3 hospitals in rural Uganda. We used the results from those identified rickettsial infections to describe the features of hospitalized rickettsial infections and address a clinical epidemiology knowledge gap in this region.

### Optimal cutoff titers for indirect immunofluorescence assay for diagnosis of scrub typhus [^cf01f4ab]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2015). Low credibility.

We determined the optimal cutoff titers in admission and convalescent-phase samples for scrub typhus indirect immunofluorescence assay using Bayesian latent class models. Cutoff titers of ≥ 1:3,200 in an admission sample or of a ≥ 4-fold rise to ≥ 1:3,200 in a convalescent-phase sample provided the highest accuracy (sensitivity, 81.6%; specificity, 100%).

### Optimal cutoff titers for indirect immunofluorescence assay for diagnosis of scrub typhus [^1ba09fa8]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2015). Low credibility.

First, we used the unbiased ROC curves to evaluate the performance of admission IFA IgM in an admission sample alone (Fig. 1A) and showed that an admission IFA IgM of ≥ 1:3,200 had 67.5% sensitivity and 100% specificity, while an admission IFA IgM of ≥ 1:400 had a higher sensitivity of 81.0% but a lower specificity of 94.1%. Therefore, a range of on-admission cutoff titers from ≥ 1:400 to ≥ 1:3,200 was evaluated further. Second, we used unbiased ROC curves to evaluate different cutoff titers of IFA IgM in paired samples (Fig. 1B to E). We found that adding a criterion of a ≥ 4-fold rise to ≥ 1:200 in a convalescent-phase sample to the diagnostic criteria lowered the overall specificities of IFA IgM. For example, adding the criterion of a ≥ 4-fold rise to ≥ 1:200 in the convalescent-phase sample to the conventional cutoff led to a decrease of specificity from 94.1% to 78.6% (Fig. 1E). Similarly, adding the criterion of a ≥ 4-fold rise to ≥ 1:200 in the convalescent-phase sample to the cutoff defined by STIC led to a decrease of specificity from 100.0% to 83.8% (data not shown). Cutoff titers of ≥ 1:3,200 in the admission sample or a ≥ 4-fold rise to ≥ 1:3,200 in the convalescent-phase sample had the highest accuracy with a sensitivity of 81.6% (95% CrI, 70.5 to 91.2) and a specificity of 100% (95% CrI, 98.4 to 100), and these values were chosen as the optimal cutoff titers for the IFA IgM.

### Determination of optimal diagnostic cut-offs for the naval medical research center scrub typhus IgM ELISA in chiang rai, Thailand [^4f961fca]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2019). Medium credibility.

In scrub typhus patients, antibodies appear following the bacteremic phase. Hence, the disease may not be readily detectable by serology if the admission sample is taken during the earlier stages of infection (< 5 days), whereas it may be if using culture or PCR. Correspondingly, there were more patients positive by ELISA in the convalescent-phase samples, despite the use of higher cutoff values. This includes samples that were negative by the IFA reference criteria, suggesting that the ELISA may be superior for detection of scrub typhus. This could speak to the subjective nature of the IFA results, which requires skilled technicians to interpret. Interestingly, our results also revealed that higher OD values correlated with PCR positivity (0.62–0.66), suggesting that the stages of the disease may not be as distinct as previously thought.

Where possible, using a combination of assays — including bacterial detection methods — to diagnose scrub typhus is likely to provide the highest accuracy, given that in some cases serology does not indicate an infection. We found that in six patients diagnosed as having scrub typhus based on quantitative and conventional PCR, culture, or eschar positivity, antibody titers remained ≤ 1:50 in both acute and convalescent samples, highlighting the value of a combination-based approach in diagnosis. For example, another study demonstrated that using both immunochromatographic tests and a loop-mediated isothermal amplification PCR assay for diagnosis of scrub typhus increased sensitivity up to 20%, without a significant loss in specificity. Although PCR and in vitro isolation methods may not be feasible in resource-limited settings, the presence of an eschar may be a valuable indicator of scrub typhus infection, particularly when combined with serology. Moreover, it is likely to be fairly specific as other common causes of eschars such as anthrax and spotted fever group rickettsioses are not prevalent in Thailand.

### Optimal cutoff and accuracy of an IgM enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for diagnosis of acute scrub typhus in Northern Thailand: an alternative reference method to the IgM immunofluorescence assay [^99521c37]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2016). Low credibility.

This study has some limitations. First, the sample size in our study was small. Second, the antigenic variation characteristic ofstrains can affect assay sensitivity and specificity. Previous studies have characterized thestrains causing human disease and presenting in vectors in Thailand, showing a dominance of Karp- and Gilliam-like genotype strains, as well as TA716 and TA763 genotype strains. However, thestrains that cause disease in the Chiangrai locality have not been fully characterized, and the incorporation of contemporary strains into the antigenic mix used in the test may increase the sensitivity. This is supported by our finding that some patients who had a firm diagnosis of scrub typhus were IgM ELISA negative, despite the time between the onset of fever and convalescent/discharge sampling being more than 10 days (see Table S1 in the supplemental material). An IgM ELISA using well-characterized contemporary local strain recombinant56-kDa outer membrane antigens could be developed and evaluated in clinical settings using appropriate statistical models. Third, the accuracy of diagnostic tests varies based on prevalence, clinical variability, and availability and timing of convalescent-phase samples. Further studies to evaluate the optimal cutoff titers and accuracy of the IgM ELISA in different settings are still required.

In conclusion, we propose that IgM ELISA should be used as an alternative serological reference test for acute scrub typhus in the locality of Chiangrai, Thailand, with the recommendation that geographically specific diagnostic cutoffs be determined for other localities and employed using appropriate statistical models.

### Rapid diagnostic tests for typhoid and paratyphoid (enteric) fever [^214b838c]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

It is important to highlight the heterogeneity among the included studies. Patient selection (unselected febrile patients versus those suspected to have enteric fever) is a major source of heterogeneity. The variation in how indeterminate results in evaluations of Typhidot (IgG positivity, IgM positivity, or both) were treated and reported was also considerable (see the ' Strengths and weaknesses of the review ' section). Most included studies took place in tertiary centres in South‐Asian settings highly endemic for enteric fever. There were also studies set in medium‐endemic regions but relatively few in sub‐Saharan Africa (Crump 2004).

Thriemer review

Thriemer and colleagues published a systematic review of TUBEX and Typhidot for the diagnosis of acute enteric fever (Thriemer 2013). They reported a meta‐analysis average sensitivity and specificity of TUBEX of 69% (95% CI 45% to 85%) and 88% (95% CI 83% to 91%) respectively. The Thriemer review authors also reported Typhidot sensitivity and specificity estimates of between 56% and 84% and 31 and 97% respectively (Thriemer 2013). They did not perform a meta‐analysis for Typhidot due to the limited data available. These results are comparable to the findings of this Cochrane Review: TUBEX sensitivity of between 71% to 85% and specificity 82% to 91%; Typhidot sensitivity 73% to 91% and specificity 70% to 87% (Table 1). There are however a number of methodological differences between the two reviews.

### Rickettsia prowazekii and real-time polymerase chain reaction [^afa08fd4]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Rickettsia prowazekii is the causative agent of epidemic or louseborne typhus, which is transmitted by the human body louse. This disease can be fatal and, without treatment with doxycycline, will cause death in up to 30% of cases. More than 30 million cases of epidemic typhus occurred during and immediately after World War I, resulting in an estimated 3 million deaths. Although the incidence of epidemic typhus is low today, the infection could reemerge in epidemic form in human populations, as recently reported in Burundi, Russia, and Algeria. Infections with R. prowazekii have been rarely reported in the United States: only 39 cases were reported from 1976 to 2001, all in persons who had no reported contact with body lice but did have contact with flying squirrels.

The ability to be acquired by the aerosol route, efficient arthropod transmission, and severe clinical outcome and death in untreated cases make R. prowazekii a category B bioterrorism agent. The former Soviet Union's Red Army developed R. prowazekii as a battlefield weapon, and the Japanese army successfully tested bombs containing the pathogen.

Since clinical signs of epidemic typhus are usually nonspecific, including fever, headaches, and severe myalgia, appropriate diagnostic methods are important. Despite recent developments in cell culture and molecular detection methods for the diagnosis of rickettsial diseases, serologic assays remain the simplest diagnostic tests to perform, even if serum samples are sent on filter paper. Nevertheless, serologic tests lack specificity because most also detect cross-reactive antibodies among the typhus-group rickettsioses. Moreover, a definite diagnosis of epidemic typhus is often delayed because the sensitivity of cell culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods is low, and serologic diagnosis can be obtained only by using advanced serologic methods such as Western blot analysis after cross-adsorptions. These methods are restricted to laboratories with biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) facilities and trained technicians. Recent studies have demonstrated the usefulness of PCR of body lice in ongoing surveillance of louse-associated infections, especially in outbreaks of epidemic typhus. The aim of our study was to develop a real-time quantitative PCR assay by using a species-specific probe that is rapid, sensitive, and specific for detecting R. prowazekii in clinical samples or in body lice in outbreaks of epidemic typhus.

### Use of multiplex real-time PCR to diagnose scrub typhus [^8095ee46]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2017). Low credibility.

Scrub typhus, caused by Orientia tsutsugamushi, is a common cause of acute undifferentiated febrile illness in the Asia-Pacific region. However, its nonspecific clinical manifestation often prevents early diagnosis. We propose the use of PCR and serologic tests as diagnostic tools. Here, we developed a multiplex real-time PCR assay using hydrolysis (TaqMan) probes targeting O. tsutsugamushi 47-kDa, groEL, and human interferon beta (IFN-β gene) genes to improve early diagnosis of scrub typhus. The amplification efficiency was higher than 94%, and the lower detection limit was 10 copies per reaction. We used a human gene as an internal DNA quality and quantity control. To determine the sensitivity of this PCR assay, we selected patients with confirmed scrub typhus who exhibited a clear 4-fold increase in the level of IgG and/or IgM. The PCR assay result was positive in 45 of 52 patients, indicating a sensitivity of 86.5% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 74.2 to 94.4). The PCR assessment was negative for all 136 non-scrub typhus patients, indicating a specificity of 100% (95% CI: 97.3 to 100). In addition, this test helped diagnose patients with inconclusive immunofluorescence assay (IFA) results and using single blood samples. In conclusion, the real-time PCR assay proposed here is sensitive and specific in diagnosing scrub typhus. Combining PCR and serologic tests will improve the diagnosis of scrub typhus among patients presenting with acute febrile illness.

Background

Description of the condition

Scrub typhus is an important cause of acute fever in Asia. It is caused by Orientia tsutsugamushi (formerly Rickettsia tsutsugamushi), an obligate intracellular bacterium in the order Rickettsia. This bacterium is transmitted in the bite of larvae of the Leptotrombidium mite, commonly called chiggers, which form the reservoir. Clinical features are non‐specific and include fever, headache, and myalgia (Watt 2003). An eschar, an ulcerated lesion with a black crust, may develop at the site of the bite. The frequency of eschar formation varies across populations from 7% to 80%. Scrub typhus may lead to pneumonia, shock, meningoencephalitis, renal failure, or myocarditis (Griffith 2014). Disease severity appears to be related to the virulence of the O tsutsugamushi strain, patient age, patient genetic factors, and previous infections, but literature regarding prognostic factors is limited (Rajapakse 2012). For untreated scrub typhus, median mortality is 6% (range 0 to 70%) (Taylor 2015). With treatment, median mortality is 1.4% (range 0 to 33.3%) (Bonell 2017).

As O tsutsugamushi is intracellular, it cannot be isolated via standard bacterial culture but instead requires cell culture. Therefore, the main modalities for diagnosis of scrub typhus are nucleic acid amplification tests (for example, polymerase chain reaction (PCR)) and serology (including immunofluorescence assays (IFAs), rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs), and enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)). The historical mainstay of diagnosis has been indirect immunofluorescence assay, but this is limited by subjectivity and a requirement for paired acute and convalescent sera. Increasingly, ELISA tests are replacing IFAs, as they are more sensitive, specific, and reproducible. Real‐time PCR on blood or eschar biopsy is helpful in diagnosing early‐stage infection (Paris 2016). In some resource‐limited settings, the only serological test available is the Weil‐Felix test, a non‐specific antibody agglutination test that cannot distinguish O tsutsugamushi from other Rickettsial infections (Koralur 2018).

### Diagnosis of scrub typhus [^472b4e1a]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2010). Low credibility.

Scrub typhus is transmitted by trombiculid mites and is endemic to East and Southeast Asia and Northern Australia. The clinical syndrome classically consists of a fever, rash, and eschar, but scrub typhus also commonly presents as an undifferentiated fever that requires laboratory confirmation of the diagnosis, usually by indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) assay. We discuss the limitations of IFA, debate the value of other methods based on antigen detection and nucleic acid amplification, and outline recommendations for future study.

### Rapid diagnostic tests for typhoid and paratyphoid (enteric) fever [^504b9648]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Widal test

The Widal test (WT) is a serological test that detects agglutinating antibodies to LPS (O antigen) and flagella (H antigen). The WT is the principal alternative test and is widely used but is neither sensitive nor specific (Olopoenia 2000). In its original format the WT required both acute and convalescent‐phase serum samples taken approximately 10 days apart. The test has also been evaluated as a single, acute‐phase serum sample (Saha 1996). In people with enteric fever, titres often rise before the clinical onset, making it very difficult to demonstrate the diagnostic four‐fold rise between initial and subsequent samples (Gill 2009).

The role of the WT is controversial because the sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values vary considerably between geographical areas (Parry 2002). Test results need to be interpreted carefully in the light of previous history of enteric fever and vaccination. Interpretation of the result is also greatly helped by knowledge of the background levels of antibodies in the local healthy population (House 2001). The increasing use of enteric fever vaccines and the occurrence of infection with other Salmonella enterica serovars lower the specificity of the WT (Waddington 2014). Infection with non‐ Salmonella organisms (for example, malaria, dengue, brucellosis) also leads to cross‐reactivity in the WT in enteric fever‐endemic regions (Olopoenia 2000). There is considerable variation in agglutinin levels among non‐infected populations. These levels are susceptible to change over time and depend on the degree of endemicity (Parry 2002). Despite these shortcomings of both sensitivity and specificity, because the WT is simple and inexpensive, it is still widely used as a diagnostic test (Fadeel 2004).

### A prospective evaluation of real-time PCR assays for the detection of orientia tsutsugamushi and Rickettsia spp. for early diagnosis of rickettsial infections during the acute phase of undifferentiated febrile illness [^32312123]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2013). Low credibility.

One hundred and eighty febrile patients were analyzed in a prospective evaluation of Orientia tsutsugamushi and Rickettsia spp. real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays for early diagnosis of rickettsial infections. By paired serology, 3.9% (7 of 180) and 6.1% (11 of 180) of patients were confirmed to have acute scrub or murine typhus, respectively. The PCR assays for the detection of O. tsutsugamushi and Rickettsia spp. had high specificity (99.4% [95% confidence interval (CI): 96.8–100] and 100% [95% CI: 97.8–100], respectively). The PCR results were also compared with immunoglobulin M (IgM) immunofluorescence assay (IFA) on acute sera. For O. tsutsugamushi, PCR sensitivity was twice that of acute specimen IgM IFA (28.6% versus 14.3%; McNemar's P = 0.3). For Rickettsia spp. PCR was four times as sensitive as acute specimen IgM IFA (36.4% versus 9.1%; P = 0.08), although this was not statistically significant. Whole blood and buffy coat, but not serum, were acceptable specimens for these PCRs. Further evaluation of these assays in a larger prospective study is warranted.

### Evaluation of rapid diagnostic tests for typhoid fever [^1693284f]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2004). Low credibility.

Laboratory diagnosis of typhoid fever requires isolation and identification of Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi. In many areas where this disease is endemic, laboratory capability is limited. Recent advances in molecular immunology have led to the identification of sensitive and specific markers for typhoid fever and technology to manufacture practical and inexpensive kits for their rapid detection. We evaluated three commercial kits for serologic diagnosis of typhoid fever. Patients presenting with ≥ 4 days of fever were enrolled at two hospitals in Southern Vietnam. Cases were patients with serotype Typhi isolated from blood samples, and controls were patients with other laboratory-confirmed illnesses. Serotype Typhi isolates were confirmed and tested for antimicrobial susceptibility at the Pasteur Institute in Ho Chi Minh City. The Widal test was run at the hospitals and the Pasteur Institute. Sera were shipped frozen to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and tested by using Multi-Test Dip-S-Ticks, TyphiDot, and TUBEX to detect immunoglobulin G (IgG), IgG and IgM, and IgM, respectively. Package insert protocol instructions were followed. We enrolled 59 patients and 21 controls. The sensitivity and specificity findings were as follows: 89 and 53% for Multi-Test Dip-S-Ticks, 79 and 89% for TyphiDot, 78 and 89% for TUBEX, and 64 and 76% for Widal testing in hospitals and 61% and 100% for Widal testing at the Pasteur Institute. For all assays, the sensitivity was highest in the second week of illness. The Widal test was insensitive and displayed interoperator variability. Two rapid kits, TyphiDot and TUBEX, demonstrated promising results.

### Clinical characteristics and outcome of children hospitalized with scrub typhus in an area of endemicity [^e24252f7]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2020). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

Scrub typhus remains a severely neglected infectious disease despite growing evidence of its importance in the rural tropics. Previous studies in children have been limited by absent or short follow-up, lack of a control group, and reliance on unvalidated diagnostic tests. The results of our study show the value of using diagnostic criteria that combine both validated bacterial and antibody-based assays to greatly increase the certainty of diagnosis. Pediatric scrub typhus infection in northern Thailand is often severe and potentially fatal. Additional studies of the bacterial, pharmacologic, and immunologic factors related to treatment outcome, along with measures to improve public awareness of this disease, should be prioritized.

### Epidemiologic changes of scrub typhus in China, 1952–2016 [^84ec4244]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Because scrub typhus is a disease that is treatable with specific antimicrobial medicine, early and accurate diagnosis is essential to reduce the risk for severe complications and death. The case-fatality rate of scrub typhus in China was reduced from 13%–16% to 0.2%–0.4% after the introduction of antirickettsial drugs. However, the absence of definitive signs and symptoms make difficult the differentiation of scrub typhus from other common febrile diseases, such as murine typhus, typhoid fever, and leptospirosis. Our study reveals that, compared with diagnosis within 2 days after illness onset, diagnosis later than 8 days after the onset of illness poses a 2.36 times higher risk of death for the patient.

The immunofluorescence assay is the reference diagnostic test for scrub typhus recommended by the World Health Organization, but the need for standardization has hampered the method's widespread use. PCR assay targeting on the gene encoding the 56-kDa type-specific antigen is highly sensitive and useful but also has limited uses because of the lack of standardized reagents or commercial diagnostic kits. Currently, the Weil-Felix test, despite its lack of sensitivity and specificity, is widely accessible throughout China, specifically in conjunction with a previous exposure history or specific eschars of scrub typhus. The finding that delayed diagnosis is associated with death highlights the need for research and development of inexpensive, accurate point-of-care diagnostic tests for the acute phase of infection in clinical settings.

### Selection of diagnostic cutoffs for murine typhus IgM and IgG immunofluorescence assay: a systematic review [^8ed11049]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Medium credibility.

Justification for selecting cutoffs.

Of a total of 78 studies, only 33 (42.3%, 33/78) justified the method to determine their diagnostic cutoff, whereas 45 (57.7%, 45/78) studies provided no clear explanation for the cutoff value used. Of the 33 studies with reasons for their selected cutoff values, 28 (84.8%, 28/33) justified it by citing a supporting previous study. The most frequently cited seropositivity criteria study was that of La Scola et al.(14.3%, 4/28). Other commonly cited studies were Blacksell et al. Coleman et al.and Hernandez et al. A further 19 references for justification – were cited by 18 studies. Three studies (9.1%, 3/33) used "manufacturers specifications" as a justification for their cutoff values, – whereas one study (3.0%, 1/33) followed the "WHO Collaborating Centre procedure" to determine their cutoff.

### Serologic diagnosis of acute rickettsiosis in children in Southern Israel [^68db69cc]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

We assessed serology results of clinically suspected rickettsiosis episodes in the hospital setting. Overall, 322 of 963 (33%) cases were serology positive. Among those, rash rates were low (30%), murine typhus (MT) predominated over spotted fever and IgM positivity rate was higher in MT. These findings suggest that during acute rickettsiosis, serology may reliably identify MT infection but may underdiagnose spotted fever.

### Accuracy of rapid IgM-based immunochromatographic and immunoblot assays for diagnosis of acute scrub typhus and murine typhus infections in Laos [^f0569bc9]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2010). Low credibility.

For the scrub typhus ICT, accuracy estimates were lower than those in previous studies with the same product; sensitivities ranged from 74% to 96% and specificities ranged from 86% to 99%. Previous studies have evaluated the murine typhus IBT for detection of total antibodies rather than only IgM. Sensitivity and specificity ranged from 51.4% to 100%, respectively, for prospectively collected samplesto 91.4% and 87.7%, respectively, for stored serum samples. Results in this study are similar to those of previous studies although accuracies were generally lower.

In this study, we used three diagnostic reference standards; the four-fold increasing antibody titer in paired samples, an admission IFA IgM titer ≥ 1:400, and a combination of both criteria. The application of these different diagnostic criteria demonstrated clear differences in sensitivity results. The IFA IgM titer ≥ 1:400 diagnostic criterion showed lower sensitivity and positivity for the MT IBT than the supposedly more stringent four-fold increasing antibody titer in paired samples. A clear discrepancy was also noted between the two reference standards when ST ICT positivity was compared with increasing time of sample collection; this was less of an the issue with the MT IBT. Specificity results were much lower for both tests when the four-fold increasing antibody titer in paired samples was used as the diagnostic criterion. This result reinforces the problem with application of an appropriate IFA assay diagnostic criteria and/or reference standard for rickettsial diseaseswhich is exacerbated by residual IgM against scrub typhus or murine typhus from previous infections, which may persist for many months.

An additional issue affecting sensitivity is that it is likely that O. tsutsugamushi in Laos are antigenically diverse, and there may be strains undetected by antibodies against the Karp, Kato, and Gilliam strains. Similar issues may affect R. typhi diagnosis, but there are few data to make this judgment.

This study has demonstrated that in a low-resource, typhus-endemic setting, the Panbio scrub typhus ICT and murine typhus Dip-S-Ticks IBT for detecting IgM have potential for diagnosing acute infections. With a high specificity a positive result in either test is a reliable marker of scrub typhus or murine typhus but, in their current format, they have low sensitivity to be clinically useful. Further development of these tests, perhaps with a lower antibody cut-off value, as expressed visually, may increase the sensitivity.

Method 1: AUROCC.

In general, the cutoffs calculated using ROC for the admission samples had lower sensitivities as compared with the convalescent-phase samples but higher specificities (Figure 2A and B). Diagnosis based on adm ≥ 3,200 gave the best balance between sensitivity (90.0%) and specificity (98.3%), at a 2.03 admission cutoff. The optimal ODs of on-admission samples were all comparable between the different diagnostic modalities, being in the range of 1.85–2.16. The cutoffs were also similar for the convalescent-phase samples, ranging from 2.02 to 2.22. The optimal was 2.03, which gave a sensitivity and specificity of 88.0% and 95.5%, respectively, based on the admission IFA IgM titer of adm ≥ 3,200 or a 4-fold ≥ 3,200 diagnostic criteria. Using nonserological methods (bacterial detection methods or presence of eschar) as a reference comparator gave low sensitivity values, with the optimal ranging from 57.1% to 77.3% depending on the test and sample timing (Table 2), whereas using the combined criteria to diagnose patients gave cutoffs with relatively high specificities but low sensitivity values.

Methods

Search strategy and selection criteria

The study protocol was registered on PROSPERO prior to conducting the study selection and data extraction process (PROSPERO registration no. CRD42024611771). To identify relevant literature on scrub typhus, a systematic search of three databases–PubMed, Scopus and Embase was conducted using PRISMA protocol with the search terms " Orientia tsutsugamushi in India", "Rickettsia in India" AND "Scrub typhus in India". The search was restricted to articles published in English between 2003 and 2023, excluding simple reviews. Articles with location-specific data on testing and positivity rates were included to analyse scrub typhus prevalence. At the same time, those describing clinical manifestations were used to assess the prevalence of different symptoms and complications in scrub typhus patients. To distinguish between seroprevalence and actual disease prevalence, a case of scrub typhus was defined as a positive for the O. tsutsugamushi pathogen using standardised tests (immuno-chromatography, Weil-Felix, IgM ELISA or indirect IFA) in addition to suspicion or clinical diagnosis of scrub typhus and/or related signs. A descriptive review was applied to case reports to describe diagnostic accuracy and specific treatment outcomes.

Data extraction

Two independent reviewers (RC and SSAH) screened all identified citations and extracted the relevant data. Titles and abstracts were screened using Covidence software, which uses Cochrane's Risk of Bias 2 tool. General information regarding study title, authors, citation, location and year of study; and details of the methodology, that is, the study type, population, gender, time-period, total number of patients tested, total number of positive patients, total number of patients included in the study, mean age, number of patients that survived or died and outcomes studied were extracted for all the articles on a predesigned template. For studies on clinical manifestations, a detailed list of all symptoms, complications and coinfections reported, as well as their frequency and outcomes, were extracted in a separate template. The final agreement on study eligibility and the data extracted was resolved after a discussion with a third reviewer (HS). The extracted data have been published as a new dataset and uploaded to the Mendeley Data repository.

### Accuracy of rapid IgM-based immunochromatographic and immunoblot assays for diagnosis of acute scrub typhus and murine typhus infections in Laos [^1749d367]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2010). Low credibility.

Assessment of diagnostic utility.

To examine the true diagnostic utility of the rapid tests in a clinical setting, four questions were posed.

1) In a patient with suspected acute typhus infection, how accurate were the ST ICT and MT IBT for diagnosis of scrub and murine typhus, respectively, in absolute terms when compared with the above mentioned established IFA diagnostic criteria?This comparison rates the ability of the test to make the correct diagnosis on the admission-phase sample compared with the final, retrospective, gold standard diagnosis made using admission-phase and convalescence-phase serum samples. It is a test of the accuracy of the rapid tests because there may not be sufficient IgM present on admission in a patient ultimately diagnosed as having the disease on the basis of increasing titers with a paired convalescent-phase sample. Thus, this tests the premise on which the rapid diagnostic test is based and the ability of the test to correctly detect the presence of IgM.

2) What is the relative accuracy of the admission ST ICT and MT IBT for the detection of IgM compared with the gold standard O. tsutsugamushi and R. typhi admission-phase IgM IFA assays?

3) What is the effect of cross-reactivity between antibodies to O. tsutsugamushi and R. typhi on the diagnostic utility of ST ICT and MT IBT compared with gold standard IFA assays for antibodies against O. tsutsugamushi and R. typhi?

4) What is the effect of sample timing, in relation to the duration of illness, on the ST ICT and MT IBT positivity rates for IgM against O. tsutsugamushi and R. typhi IFA assay-positive patients?

### Optimal cutoff and accuracy of an IgM enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for diagnosis of acute scrub typhus in Northern Thailand: an alternative reference method to the IgM immunofluorescence assay [^0d14f02f]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2016). Low credibility.

The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) has been proposed as an alternative serologic diagnostic test to the indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) for scrub typhus. Here, we systematically determine the optimal sample dilution and cutoff optical density (OD) and estimate the accuracy of IgM ELISA using Bayesian latent class models (LCMs). Data from 135 patients with undifferentiated fever were reevaluated using Bayesian LCMs. Every patient was evaluated for the presence of an eschar and tested with a blood culture for Orientia tsutsugamushi, three different PCR assays, and an IgM IFA. The IgM ELISA was performed for every sample at sample dilutions from 1:100 to 1:102,400 using crude whole-cell antigens of the Karp, Kato, and Gilliam strains of O. tsutsugamushi developed by the Naval Medical Research Center. We used Bayesian LCMs to generate unbiased receiver operating characteristic curves and found that the sample dilution of 1:400 was optimal for the IgM ELISA. With the optimal cutoff OD of 1.474 at a sample dilution of 1:400, the IgM ELISA had a sensitivity of 85.7% (95% credible interval [CrI], 77.4% to 86.7%) and a specificity of 98.1% (95% CrI, 97.2% to 100%) using paired samples. For the ELISA, the OD could be determined objectively and quickly, in contrast to the reading of IFA slides, which was both subjective and labor-intensive. The IgM ELISA for scrub typhus has high diagnostic accuracy and is less subjective than the IgM IFA. We suggest that the IgM ELISA may be used as an alternative reference test to the IgM IFA for the serological diagnosis of scrub typhus.

### Evaluation of a new serological test for the detection of anti-Coxiella and anti-Rickettsia antibodies [^16e3e854]. Microbes and Infection (2015). Low credibility.

Coxiella burnetii and members of the genus Rickettsia are obligate intracellular bacteria. Since cultivation of these organisms requires dedicated techniques, their diagnosis usually relies on serological or molecular biology methods. Immunofluorescence is considered the gold standard to detect antibody-reactivity towards these organisms. Here, we assessed the performance of a new automated epifluorescence immunoassay (InoDiag) to detect IgM and IgG against C. burnetii, Rickettsia typhi and Rickettsia conorii. Samples were tested with the InoDiag assay. A total of 213 sera were tested, of which 63 samples from Q fever, 20 from spotted fever rickettsiosis, 6 from murine typhus and 124 controls. InoDiag results were compared to micro-immunofluorescence. For acute Q fever, the sensitivity of phase 2 IgG was only of 30% with a cutoff of 1 arbitrary unit (AU). In patients with acute Q fever with positive IF IgM, sensitivity reached 83% with the same cutoff. Sensitivity for chronic Q fever was 100% whereas sensitivity for past Q fever was 65%. Sensitivity for spotted Mediterranean fever and murine typhus were 91% and 100%, respectively. Both assays exhibited a good specificity in control groups, ranging from 79% in sera from patients with unrelated diseases or EBV positivity to 100% in sera from healthy patients. In conclusion, the InoDiag assay exhibits an excellent performance for the diagnosis of chronic Q fever but a very low IgG sensitivity for acute Q fever likely due to low reactivity of phase 2 antigens present on the glass slide. This defect is partially compensated by the detection of IgM. Because it exhibits a good negative predictive value, the InoDiag assay is valuable to rule out a chronic Q fever. For the diagnosis of rickettsial diseases, the sensitivity of the InoDiag method is similar to conventional immunofluorescence.

### Rickettsioses as underrecognized cause of hospitalization for febrile illness, Uganda [^2c478c61]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

The complexity of rickettsial serodiagnostics during acute illness has limited clinical characterization in Africa. We used archived samples from sepsis (n = 259) and acute febrile illness (n = 70) cohorts in Uganda to identify spotted fever and typhus group rickettsiae by using immunofluorescence assay and clinically validated rRNA reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR). Among 329 participants, 10.0% had rickettsial infections (n = 33; n = 20 identified with immunofluorescence assay and n = 13 by RT-PCR). Serum rRNA RT-PCR was 75.0% (95% CI 42.8–94.5%) sensitive and 91.2% (95% CI 85.8–95.1%) specific. Thrombocytopenia was more common among patients with rickettsial infections than with other nonmalarial infections (adjusted odds ratio 3.7; p = 0.003). No participants were on a tetracycline antimicrobial drug at admission. rRNA RT-PCR is a promising diagnostic strategy for identifying acute rickettsial infections. Doxycycline should be included in empiric antimicrobial drug regimens for nonmalarial febrile illness in this region.

### Optimal cutoff and accuracy of an IgM enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for diagnosis of acute scrub typhus in Northern Thailand: an alternative reference method to the IgM immunofluorescence assay [^44d815e8]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2016). Low credibility.

To select a single optimal cutoff OD at a sample dilution of 1:400, the sensitivities and specificities of all possible ODs were evaluated between the recommended OD range when only the admission sample was available (OD = 1.010) and that when the paired convalescent/discharge samples were available (OD = 1.474) (Table 1). An OD of 1.474 was selected as the optimal cutoff because it provided the highest overall accuracy. Using a cutoff OD of 1.474 at a sample dilution of 1:400, Bayesian LCMs estimated that the IgM ELISA had a sensitivity of 69.0% (95% CrI, 60.6% to 76.9%) and a specificity of 100% (95% CrI, 99.1% to 100%) for the admission sample alone and a sensitivity of 85.7% (95% CrI, 77.4 to 86.7%) and a specificity of 98.1% (95% CrI, 97.2 to 100%) with the addition of the paired samples (Table 2). The Bayesian LCM estimated that there were 29 scrub typhus patients (95% CrI, 27 to 33 patients), representing a prevalence of scrub typhus at 21.8% (95% CrI, 15.1% to 29.5%) in the study participants. There was no significant difference between the sensitivities of the IgM ELISA and the IgM IFA for admission samples alone (69.0% versus 69.0%; Bayesian P value = 0.50) or between the sensitivities of the two tests using paired samples (85.7% versus 86.2%; Bayesian P value = 0.31).

### Accuracy of rapid IgM-based immunochromatographic and immunoblot assays for diagnosis of acute scrub typhus and murine typhus infections in Laos [^ca92284f]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

Scrub typhus, caused by Orientia tsutsugamushi, and murine typhus, caused by Rickettsia typhi, are important acute febrile illnesses in the Asia–Pacific region.–Clinical diagnosis of typhus is difficult because signs and symptoms are similar to those of many other febrile diseases such as typhoid, leptospirosis, and dengue virus infection. Laboratory diagnosis of scrub typhus and murine typhus infection has relied on the detection of antibodies to O. tsutsugamushi and R. typhi, and the gold standard assay is the indirect immunofluorescent antibody (IFA) assay. Development of rapid diagnostic tests using immunochromatographic test (ICT) or immunoblot test (IBT) technologies has provided a mechanism for point-of-care serologic testing. To date, there is limited information on the utility of rapid tests for the diagnosis of acute scrub and murine typhus, and published information has concentrated on whole antibody rather than IgM-specific tests.

We assessed the diagnostic capacity of a commercially available rapid ICT for detection of IgM against O. tsutsugamushi and an IBT for detection of IgM against R. typhi to aid the diagnosis of acute scrub and murine typhus infection in patients in the tropical and disease-endemic environment of the Lao People's Democratic Republic (Laos).

### Optimal cutoff titers for indirect immunofluorescence assay for diagnosis of scrub typhus [^dbe8ad09]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2015). Low credibility.

To determine the optimal cutoff titers in an admission sample and a convalescent-phase sample for IFA IgM, two stages of statistical analysis were performed. First, we used Bayesian LCMs to generate unbiased ROC curves for the sensitivities and specificities of all possible cutoff titers of IFA IgM in the admission sample alone. Bayesian LCMs with conditional dependence between IFA IgM and an IgM immunochromatographic test (ICT) were used as previously described. In brief, Bayesian LCMs estimated the prevalence and the sensitivity and specificity of each diagnostic test with their 95% credible intervals (CrI) using the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. Bayesian LCMs do not assume that any diagnostic test or combination of diagnostic tests is perfect. The true disease status of each patient was estimated by the model in each MCMC iteration and expressed as the overall disease prevalence. Unbiased ROC curves were generated as previously described. Potential optimal cutoff titers for admission IFA IgM were selected based on the overall accuracy at each titer. Second, we used Bayesian LCMs to generate unbiased ROC curves for the sensitivities and specificities of IFA IgM using a combination of each potential optimal cutoff titer in the admission sample selected in the first stage and a ≥ 4-fold rise to all possible cutoff titers of IFA IgM in the convalescent-phase sample. The optimal cutoff titers for the IFA IgM were selected based on overall accuracy. Text S1 and S2 in the supplemental material provide full data sets and the models used, respectively.

A total of 161 patients were included in the study. The median age was 41 years (interquartile range [IQR], 29 to 51 years), and 63% (99/158) were male. The median duration of fever before admission to hospital was 5 days (IQR, 3 to 7 days), and 138 patients (85.7%) had convalescent-phase samples available. The median duration between the admission sample and convalescent-phase sample was 12 days (IQR, 3 to 14 days). Culture, a combination of PCR assays, IgM ICT, and the presence of eschar were positive in 9, 27, 31, and 17 patients, respectively. Overall, 62 patients were considered IFA IgM positive based on the conventional cutoff titers (42 had an admission IFA IgM of ≥ 1:400), and 46 patients were considered IFA IgM positive based on STIC (20 had admission IFA IgM of ≥ 1:12,800).

Clinical Features, Diagnosis, and Treatment

Murine typhus is characterized by the abrupt onset of fever with accompanying headache, chills, myalgia, and malaise. Rash, which is the sign that often prompts a clinician to consider a rickettsiosis, is absent in 50%and may be present in as few as 20% of those with darkly pigmented skin. When present, rash is usually macular or maculopapular with a truncal distribution. Murine typhus is often accompanied by gastrointestinal symptoms (i.e. anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain), and in severe cases may be complicated by pulmonary, renal, and neurologic dysfunction. Death is reported in 4% of hospitalized patients. The clinical features of R. felis infection are similar to murine typhus — description is based on a growing number of case reports in the last two decades as summarized in a review by Parola. Notable differences include rash in 75% and eschar in 13% of these reported cases. An eschar-like lesion has only been described once in a patient with murine typhus. To our knowledge, there has never been a death attributed to infection with R. felis.

Isolation of the organism is definitive evidence of infection, but because of the need for technical expertise and biosafety level 3 containment, it is rarely performed. Interestingly, to our knowledge, R. felis has never been isolated from a clinical sample — infection has been confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing. The immunohistochemical demonstration of rickettsiae within skin biopsy or tissue specimens is effective, but like culture, it is not available to most clinicians, and R. felis has not been visualized in human lesions. Serology continues to be the mainstay of diagnosis, but as demonstrated in patients with murine typhus, antirickettsial antibodies are present in less than 20% at 7 days of illness. Therefore, serodiagnosis requires both acute- and convalescent-phase sera to demonstrate seroconversion or a 4-fold titer increase. The serologic method of choice is the immunofluorescence assay. Serologically, anti- R. felis antibodies are cross reactive with spotted fever group antigen (e.g. R. rickettsii and R. conorii) and variably cross reactive with typhus group antigen.–Unfortunately, as discussed below, peripheral blood PCR is not sensitive for the detection of rickettsemia for rickettsioses other than R. felis.

### Usefulness of nested PCR for the diagnosis of scrub typhus in clinical practice: a prospective study [^18fb40ef]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2006). Low credibility.

The aims of this study were to determine the diagnostic accuracy and clinical usefulness of using nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the diagnosis of scrub typhus through a prospective comparison of nested PCR and indirect immunofluorescent antibody assay (IFA). We conducted a multi-center prospective study of patients who were suffering with possible scrub typhus infection. Whole blood samples were collected for PCR testing, and sera were obtained for serology evaluation using the indirect IFA and the passive hemagglutination assay (PHA). We prospectively studied 135 patients with possible scrub typhus. One hundred eighteen patients were confirmed as having scrub typhus, 7 patients were undetermined, and 10 patients were confirmed as having other diseases. The results of nested PCR assay showed a sensitivity of 82.2% and a specificity of 100%. Ninety-six of the 118 patients were positive for IgM on their admission day. Of the 22 patients who were negative for IgM antibody at admission, 19 had positive results for nested PCR of the buffy coat. The nested PCR assay of the buffy coat is useful as a rapid and reliable test for confirming the diagnosis of scrub typhus.

### Optimal cutoff and accuracy of an IgM enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for diagnosis of acute scrub typhus in Northern Thailand: an alternative reference method to the IgM immunofluorescence assay [^18a4b5f7]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2016). Low credibility.

The sensitivity and specificity values estimated by our study are unbiased, because they are based on the true status of patients predicted by the Bayesian LCM. Previous studies reported that the NMRC IgM ELISA had higher sensitivity and lower specificity than the immunoperoxidase (IIP) assay (the IIP assay is analogous to IFA with the exception that different substrates are employed) titer of 1:400, which was assumed to be "perfect". Suwanabun et al. reported that the NMRC IgM ELISA had a sensitivity of 92.9% and a specificity of 93.6%. Coleman et al. reported that the NMRC IgM ELISA at a sample dilution of 1:400 had a sensitivity of 94.2% and a specificity of 91.3%. However, the sensitivities reported by Suwannabun and Coleman were predicted to be overestimated, and this could be because low cutoff ODs were used and sensitivity was biased toward a group of patients who had IIP assay titers of ≥ 1:400. The specificities reported by Suwanabun and Coleman could be underestimated because low cutoff ODs were used and the IgM ELISA could be positive in scrub typhus patients who had an IIP assay titer of < 1:400. These problems were due to disease misclassification by the imperfect gold standard. In contrast, the sensitivity and specificity values estimated by our study were not biased toward an imperfect reference test. This is also supported by the post hoc model evaluation showing that the sensitivity and specificity estimated by the Bayesian LCMs are comparable to the naive sensitivity and specificity values estimated in a group of patients with firm diagnoses of scrub typhus and of other diseases, respectively.

### Determination of optimal diagnostic cut-offs for the naval medical research center scrub typhus IgM ELISA in chiang rai, Thailand [^6eef0a66]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2019). Medium credibility.

One limitation of this study is that the convalescent sample collection dates were not available. A confirmatory, retrospective diagnosis is often made based on a 4-fold rise between the acute and convalescent-phase samples. The main drawback to using this criterion is that adequate time is needed between collection of the two samples to demonstrate a rise in titer, and in some cases, as mentioned previously, titers may not rise at all. Delaying treatment for this long could result in a number of complications including systemic infection and multiple organ dysfunction; hence, diagnosis is based on acute samples. Furthermore, depending on the onset of illness, admission samples may already exhibit high antibody titers, in which case, a 4-fold rise may not be seen. In this cohort, only eight patients of the 33 scrub typhus–positive patients showed a 4-fold rise or more. Therefore, in clinical settings — where treatment should be administered as soon as possible — it is necessary to establish a single cutoff titer based on regional endemicity.

The results demonstrate ELISA to be a suitable alternative to the IFA, offering advantages over it such as reader objectivity and reproducibility. Correlation between the two exceeded 0.7, at the optimum cutoff of 2.0. In this study, pooled antigens of the Karp, Kato, and Gilliam strain were used. Fittingly, studies have identified predominantly Karp-type strains — and to a lesser extent Gilliam-type strains — around Thailand, although the strains in Chiang Rai have not been fully characterized. Furthermore, culturing native antigens requires a biosafety level 3 facility, making it less practical to perform in rural areas. ELISAs that use a recombinant 56-kDa antigen have been shown to be a highly sensitive and specific alternative.

Here, we have shown the ELISA to be a valuable diagnostic tool, especially at a recommended cutoff of around 2.0, and a total absorbance cutoff of 4.0. These values can be adjusted to find an appropriate balance between sensitivity and specificity, depending on whether the test is being conducted from an epidemiological or diagnostic perspective. Considering the unusually high value of these cutoffs, there is a need to 1) validate the use of the cutoffs in Chiang Rai, and 2) re-evaluate the cutoffs used in other endemic regions to ensure they are considering background antibody levels.

### Accuracy of rapid IgM-based immunochromatographic and immunoblot assays for diagnosis of acute scrub typhus and murine typhus infections in Laos [^f446ffd1]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2010). Low credibility.

We studied the diagnostic accuracy of a rapid immunochromatographic test (ICT) for detection of IgM against scrub typhus (ST ICT) and an immunoblot test for the detection of IgM against murine typhus (MT IBT) by using admission serum samples from 1,030 febrile patients in Laos. Sensitivity and specificity for the ST ICT determined by using the diagnostic criteria of a four-fold increase in IgM against Orientia tsutsugamushi between paired samples were 23.8% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 15.9–33.3%) and 86.2% (95% CI = 84.1–88.6%), respectively. Sensitivity and specificity for the ST ICT determined by using an admission IgM titer ≥ 1:400 were 39.1% (95% CI = 34.1–44.2%) and 99.5% (95% CI = 98.7–99.9%), respectively. Sensitivity and specificity for the MT IBT determined by using the criteria of a four-fold increase in IgM against Rickettsia typhi between paired serum samples were 61.2% (95% CI = 53.7–68.3%) and 86.5% (95% CI = 84.1–88.8%), respectively. Sensitivity and specificity for the MT IBT determined by using an admission IgM titer ≥ 1:400 were 54.6% (95% CI = 49.1–60.0%) and 94.1% (95% CI = 92.0–95.7%), respectively. Both assays had relatively good specificity but low sensitivity and thus have limited utility for admission diagnosis.

### Determination of optimal diagnostic cut-offs for the naval medical research center scrub typhus IgM ELISA in chiang rai, Thailand [^e863e802]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2019). Medium credibility.

Attribution of diagnosis.

Patients were classified as having scrub typhus on the basis of a modified scrub typhus infection diagnostic criteriawhich included one or more of the following: 1) Positivity in at least two of the three PCR assays targeting 56 kDa, 47 kDa, and groEL genes; 2) presence of an eschar; 3) successful in vitro isolation of O. tsutsugamushi. Furthermore, the following serological criteria were used: 4) an IFA IgM admission titer of ≥ 1:3,200 (adm ≥ 3,200) or 5) ≥ 4-fold rise to ≥ 1:3,200 in the convalescent sample (4-fold ≥ 3,200) that had previously been optimized as an IFA cutoff for Chiang Rai. Patients who did not have a convalescent sample collected were excluded from this study.

Analysis.

To determine the most appropriate method to diagnose scrub typhus in Chiang Rai the following approaches were used.

Method 1: area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUROCC).

To determine the most appropriate ELISA OD cutoff, ROC curve analysis was performed using each component of the diagnostic criteria (i.e. PCR, IFA, etc.) as a reference comparator. To calculate a range of ELISA OD cutoff for admission samples alone or combined with convalescent samples, the ROCTAB command (Stata/IC 14.0 for Mac; Stata Corp. College Station, TX) and a range of diagnostic OD cut-offs were calculated with resultant sensitivity, specificity, and AUROCC values. The ELISA OD cutoff that provided the best balance between sensitivity and specificity was selected. Pearson correlation coefficients between individual reference assays and the scrub typhus IgM ELISA assay at various diagnostic cutoffs were also calculated.

Method 2: net total absorbance (NTA).

Using a method previously described, the net OD of the 1:100, 1:400, 1:1,600, and 1:6,400 serum dilutions were summed to obtain the NTA. Total absorbances of 1.000 or greater were considered evidence of scrub typhus and the titers were determined to be the inverse of the highest dilution that had an OD of 0.200 or greater. The cut-off of 1.000 was derived from a previous study that showed the benefit of using cutoff OD values of between 0.8 and 1.3 OD that gave the scientists the highest sensitivities and specificities of the Orientia -specific ELISA.

DISCUSSION

In this study, we have determined an optimal IgM ELISA cutoff value for diagnosis of scrub typhus infections in Chiang Rai by performing ROC curve analysis on results utilizing admission and convalescent-phase samples.

The conventional IFA IgM cutoff titer of ≥ 1:400 in the admission sample or a 4-fold rise to ≥ 1:200 in the convalescent-phase sample may lead to a high rate of false positivity. Using the same reference samples from Chiang Rai as this present study, Bayesian latent class modeling was used to show that an admission titer of adm ≥ 3,200 or a 4-fold ≥ 3,200 in the convalescent-phase sample provided the highest sensitivity and specificity. A strong correlation was seen between increasing OD values and IFA IgM positivity using this criterion (0.79–0.82), thereby validating its use as a reference standard. Cutoffs of 1.854–2.222 were found to be optimal for the admission sample and convalescent-phase samples, in-line with the Blacksell et al.study, which found a cutoff of 1.474 to be optimal at a 1:400 sample dilution. Performance of the ELISA shows sensitivity ranging from 57.1% to 90.0% and specificities of 85.2% to 97.0%, depending on the reference criteria and sample timing. When using the total absorbance for serum dilutions 1:100, 1:400, 1:1,600, and 1:6,400 as cutoffs, previous studies have used a value of 1.0, for samples that pass a preliminary screen (OD ≥ 0.5 at a 1:100 dilution). These studies have been conducted in endemic regions such as Korea and India, as well as those with lower prevalence of scrub typhus, such as Peru.– However, we show here that in endemic regions such as Chiang Rai, cutoffs of around 3.0 and 4.0 are more appropriate for admission and convalescent samples, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity values obtained using this method are comparable with those obtained using the single dilution cutoff titers. Despite a limited sample size, the results are likely to be representative of the Chiang Rai population, given the spread of age (median: 42, IQR: 29–51), and the proportion of males and females (61% males).

### Flying squirrel-associated typhus, United States [^61ea722f]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Inhalation and transdermal or mucous membrane inoculation of infected louse feces are well-established routes of pathogen transmission during epidemics of human louse-borne typhus. The mechanism by which R. prowazekii is transmitted from flying squirrels to humans is less well understood. Various routes have been hypothesized, but none have been empirically established. Plausible mechanisms include inhalation or direct introduction (through mucous membrane or dermal abrasion) of infected feces from louse or flea ectoparasites of flying squirrels or through the bite of infected flea ectoparasites of flying squirrels. At least one species of flea ectoparasite (Orchopeas howardii) of flying squirrels is known to opportunistically bite humans and could serve as a bridge vector for transmission from flying squirrel to human. Rickettsiae transmission among captive flying squirrels, however, has only been demonstrated with a louse vector. While the exact mechanism of pathogen transmission has not yet been determined, the lack of detectable exposure to R. prowazekii in the household members or co-workers of documented cases supports the idea that the risk for R. prowazekii infection after casual or indirect exposure to flying squirrels is low. Rather, existing evidence suggests that infection follows from close physical contact with flying squirrels or from exposure to a concentrated source of infectious materials (e.g. nests, dander, or infected ectoparasites).

Currently, no formal system for epidemic typhus surveillance exists in the United States, and diagnosis is hindered by the lack of rapid and reliable commercial tests. R. prowazekii infections can be confirmed by serologic testing, PCR, or organism culture. Commercial testing is, however, not widely available, and commercial serologic tests lack specificity because most detect antibodies reactive with a surrogate typhus-group rickettsial antigen (typically R. typhi). PCR (in conjunction with DNA sequencing) is a highly specific diagnostic tool but has low sensitivity for commonly available clinical specimens, such as whole blood or serum. PCR may be used to greater effect on other clinical specimens (e.g. cerebrospinal fluid, lymphocytes, and skin biopsy) if they are collected and submitted for testing. Specific serologic and molecular testing is available at CDC for specimens submitted through state public health laboratories.

### High seroprevalence of antibodies against spotted fever and scrub typhus bacteria in patients with febrile illness, Kenya [^e2ff1bdf]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Serum samples from patients in Kenya with febrile illnesses were screened for antibodies against bacteria that cause spotted fever, typhus, and scrub typhus. Seroprevalence was 10% for spotted fever group, < 1% for typhus group, and 5% for scrub typhus group. Results should help clinicians expand their list of differential diagnoses for undifferentiated fevers.

### Evaluation of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using recombinant 56-kDa type-specific antigens derived from multipleStrains for detection of scrub typhus infection [^ed4a9502]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2019). Medium credibility.

Scrub typhus is caused by the intracellular bacterium Orientia tsutsugamushi. The 56-kDa type-specific antigen (TSA) displays a significant antigenic variation across different O. tsutsugamushi strains. To minimize the influence of the antigenic diversity of TSA on assay sensitivity, we developed a mixed-TSA enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (mixed-TSA ELISA) using a mixture of recombinant TSAs of prototype (Karp, Gilliam, and Kato) and local (TW-1, TW-10, TW-19, and TW-22) O. tsutsugamushi strains as antigens to detect immunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies against O. tsutsugamushi. These four local strains covered a major part of the total genetic diversity of TSA gene of O. tsutsugamushi in Taiwan. A total of 109 acute-phase serum samples from O. tsutsugamushi polymerase chain reaction-positive, scrub typhus patients, and 82 negative control serum samples from non-scrub typhus cases were used for evaluation of the recombinant TSA-based ELISA. We compared the performance of the mixed-TSA ELISA with immunofluorescence assay (IFA), which is considered the gold standard method for the serological diagnosis of scrub typhus. The results indicated that the sensitivity of IgM mixed-TSA ELISA (80.7%) was significantly higher than that of IgM IFA (68.8%). We demonstrated that the mixed-TSA ELISA had a high sensitivity and specificity and can be used for screening of scrub typhus patient in the early phase of the disease.

### Genotyping of orientia tsutsugamushi from humans with scrub typhus, Laos [^09b69503]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Although our data are preliminary, diversity of nucleotide sequences of the 56-kDa protein–encoding gene in isolates from Laos might limit sensitivity and specificity of serologic methods. A recent study showed that addition of a serotype to the panel of O. tsutsugamushi antigens used for testing improved sensitivity of antibody detection in patients in Thailand. We demonstrated that, in analysis of sera in the diagnosis of scrub typhus contracted in Laos, antigen pools should contain at least Karp and Gilliam strain antigens. Furthermore, new genotypes identified in patients in Laos might be related to previously unrecognized type strains. However, cross-reactivity with Gilliam, Kato, and Kawasaki serotypes enabled serologic diagnosis in the initial study, including 1 patient infected with a Karp-related bacteria.

Phylogenetic studies based on larger fragments of sequences of the 56-kDa protein–encoding gene and of other genes of O. tsutsugamushi would help to better characterize the new genotypes identified in our study and their relationship with known serotypes. Expanding the panel of antigens used to test patients suspected of having scrub typhus to take into account local antigenic diversity would improve sensitivity of serologic assays for this disease.

### Clinical usefulness of eschar polymerase chain reaction for the diagnosis of scrub typhus: a prospective study [^0eda99f3]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Background

The aim of this study was to determine the diagnostic utility of performing eschar polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the diagnosis of scrub typhus through a prospective comparison of eschar PCR results with indirect immunofluorescent antibody assay (IFA) results.

Methods

We conducted a multicenter prospective study involving patients with possible scrub typhus. Whole-blood samples and eschars were obtained for serological evaluation and PCR. A new crust was formed several days later at the site of the removed eschar. The newly formed crust was taken for performance of the second eschar PCR. Additional blood samples and eschars were collected, if possible, at 1-week intervals for 1 month after antibiotic treatment.

Results

We prospectively studied 135 patients with possible scrub typhus. Of these patients, 118 had scrub typhus confirmed on the basis of either a single indirect immunofluorescent specific immunoglobulin M titer against Orientia tsutsugamushi of ≥ 1:10 or a ≥ 4-fold increase in the follow-up titer. The results of nested PCR assay of the eschars demonstrated a sensitivity of 0.86 (95% confidence interval, 0.78–0.92) and a specificity of 1 (95% confidence interval, 0.05–1). Among the 50 patients who showed positive results of eschar PCR at admission, 46 (92%) also showed positive results for the follow-up PCR test of the newly formed eschar after the treatment with antibiotics.

Conclusions

The eschar PCR assay was useful as a rapid and reliable test to confirm the diagnosis of scrub typhus, even though the patients received treatment with appropriate antibiotics, such as macrolides, quinolones, and tetracycline, which are all active against Orientia and Rickettsia species.

### Dot-ELISA rapid test using recombinant 56-kDa protein antigens for serodiagnosis of scrub typhus [^86d8625f]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2015). Low credibility.

We developed a rapid dot-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (dot-ELISA) using the combination of recombinant 56-kDa protein antigens that exhibited broad reactivity with serum antibodies against the four most prevalent strains (Karp, Kato, Gilliam, and TA763) of Orientia tsutsugamushi. The assay is rapid (30 minutes), and can be done at room temperature, and results can be read by the naked eye. Only a simple shaker is required to wash the membrane. Sera from 338 patients suspected of being ill with scrub typhus from rural hospitals around Thailand were tested using this dot-ELISA. Seventy-five (22.2%) patients were found to be positive. The sensitivity and specificity of dot-ELISA were determined using the indirect immunofluorescent assay (IFA) test as the gold standard, with the cutoff titer of immunoglobulin peroxidase conjugate M (IgM)/G (IgG) greater than 1:400/1:400. The dot-ELISA had a sensitivity of 98.5%, a specificity of 96.3%, a positive predictive value of 86.7%, and a negative predictive value of 99.6% for the acute-phase specimens. The results indicate that dot-ELISA rapid test using recombinant 56-kDa protein antigen was comparable with the IFA test and may be very useful for the diagnosis of scrub typhus in rural hospitals, where IFA is not available.

### Antibiotics for treating scrub typhus [^3507f41e]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Potential biases in the review process

We attempted to minimize bias in the review process by conducting a comprehensive search of all published and non‐published literature with no language restrictions. Two review authors assessed the eligibility of studies, extracted data, and independently judged risk of bias. We resolved disagreements by consensus and by consultation with the fourth review author. We altered our inclusion criteria for this updated review. In particular, we excluded studies that used the Weil‐Felix test as the sole measure of laboratory confirmation, given poor specificity. As a result, we excluded one trial that had been included in the previous review (Sheehy 1973).

Agreements and disagreements with other studies or reviews

Our findings are in agreement with those of a recently published meta‐analysis (Wee 2017), which concluded that evidence is insufficient to support recommending one drug over the others examined here. However, authors of the meta‐analysis included trials that employed the Weil‐Felix test as the sole diagnostic tool, and the poor specificity associated with this test may raise the level of heterogeneity amongst pooled participants.

### Optimal cutoff and accuracy of an IgM enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for diagnosis of acute scrub typhus in Northern Thailand: an alternative reference method to the IgM immunofluorescence assay [^a7a5f123]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2016). Low credibility.

Post hoc model evaluation.

To validate the sensitivity of the IgM ELISA estimated by the Bayesian LCMs, we estimated the naive sensitivity of the IgM ELISA in the patients who had a firm diagnosis of scrub typhus. The firm diagnosis of scrub typhus was made on the basis of either a positive blood culture, a combination of positive PCR assays, or the presence of an eschar in our data set. To validate the specificity of the IgM ELISA estimated by the Bayesian LCMs, we estimated the naive specificity of the IgM ELISA results in patients with a firm single diagnosis of other diseases, including murine typhus and dengue, in the data set described previously. The diagnosis of murine typhus was made if there was a ≥ 4-fold increase in theIgM IFA titer between paired samples (using slides coated withstrain Wilmington; ARRL, Geelong, Australia). The diagnosis of dengue was defined by the detection of NS1 antigen using Panbio ELISAs and IgM antibodies (Panbio, Brisbane, Australia) in paired samples.

Evaluation of ELISA repeatability.

Between- and within-day variation was determined by calculating the mean and the standard deviation (SD) of the positive control on each plate to derive the between-plate, between-day, and within-day percent coefficient of variation (%CV) as follows: %CV = (SD/mean) × 100. Median values and interquartile ranges (IQR) were also calculated for the population.

### Determination of optimal diagnostic cut-offs for the naval medical research center scrub typhus IgM ELISA in chiang rai, Thailand [^aaba1b73]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2019). Medium credibility.

In this diagnostic accuracy study, we evaluated data from 135 febrile patients from Chiang Rai, to determine the optimal optical density (OD) cutoffs for an in-house scrub typhus IgM ELISA. Receiver operating characteristic curves were generated using a panel of reference assays, including an IgM immunofluorescence assay (IFA), PCR, in vitro isolation, presence of an eschar, or a combination of these. Altogether, 33 patients (24.4%) were diagnosed as having scrub typhus. Correlation between positivity by IFA and increasing OD values peaked at a cutoff of 2.0, whereas there was little association between positivity by culture or eschar with increasing ELISA cutoffs-cutoffs of 3.0 and 4.0 were demonstrated to be optimal for the total absorbance of the OD at dilutions 1:100, 1:400, 1:1,600, and 1:6,400, for admission and convalescent samples, respectively. The optimal cutoff at a 1:100 dilution was found to be between 1.85 and 2.22 for admission samples and convalescent-phase samples, respectively. Sensitivities for the cutoffs varied from 57.1% to 90.0% depending on the reference test and sample timing, whereas specificities ranged from 85.2% to 99.0%. We therefore recommend a cutoff of around 2.0, depending on the sensitivity and specificity desired in clinical or epidemiological settings. The results demonstrate the ELISA to be a valuable diagnostic tool, suitable for use in resource-limited endemic regions, especially when used in combination with other diagnostic modalities such as the presence of an eschar.

### Assessment of rapid diagnostic tests for typhoid diagnosis and assessment of febrile illness outbreaks in Fiji [^e3e28f85]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2021). Medium credibility.

The diagnosis of typhoid is complicated by the lack of sensitivity of existing methods. Blood culture is the most common method used and its sensitivity ranges from 40% to 66%. – The volume of blood inoculated, and prior antimicrobial therapy, influence its performance. Blood culture provides a definitive diagnosis, and yields an isolate for antimicrobial susceptibility testing, but the length of time required for blood culture to yield a result limits its value for individual patient diagnosis and for the rapid attribution of febrile illness outbreaks to typhoid. Several antibody detection RDT for typhoid are available, but their value for routine individual patient management is limited by their lack of sensitivity and specificity. – Little attention has been given to the use of typhoid RDTs in determining the etiology of a febrile illness outbreak, a common public health problem in Fiji and elsewhere. In typhoid outbreaks in Fiji, the number of cases usually varies from 15 to 30 patients. When they occur in an area remote to a blood culture service confirming the diagnosis is a challenge. In such circumstances, an RDT with inadequate sensitivity and specificity to guide individual patient management might still be useful for rapid identification of a typhoid outbreak because of the likelihood of a common etiology for the outbreak and a larger number of persons available for testing.

We evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of available typhoid RDTs on stored serum samples from patients and subjects in Fiji. We then sought to examine if any are suitable to rule in or out typhoid as the cause of an outbreak.

### Simple dipstick assay for the detection of Salmonella typhi-specific IgM antibodies and the evolution of the immune response in patients with typhoid fever [^5a911b6a]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2002). Low credibility.

Application of a dipstick assay for the detection of Salmonella typhi-specific IgM antibodies on samples collected from S. typhi or S. paratyphi culture-positive patients at the day of admission to the hospital revealed the presence of specific IgM antibodies in 43.5%, 92.9%, and 100% for samples collected 4–6 days, 6–9 days, and > 9 days after the onset of fever, respectively. The mean sensitivity for samples collected an average of 6.6 days after the onset of fever was 65.3%. Culture was positive in 65.9% of the cases with a final clinical diagnosis of typhoid fever. Testing of paired serum samples from culture negative patients with a final clinical diagnosis of typhoid fever resulted in staining of the dipstick in 4.3% of the samples collected at the day of admission to the hospital and in 76.6% of the samples collected one week later, thereby provided strong supporting evidence of typhoid fever by demonstrating seroconversion in a large proportion of the patients. The dipstick assay may thus also be useful for the serodiagnosis of culture-negative patients with clinical signs and symptoms consistent with typhoid fever. The advantages of the dipstick assay are that the result can be obtained on the same day allowing a prompt treatment, that only a small volume of serum is needed, and that no special laboratory equipment is needed to perform the assay. The stability of the reagents of the dipstick and the simplicity of the assay allows its use in places that lack laboratory facilities.

### Diagnostic accuracy assessment of immunochromatographic tests for the rapid detection of antibodies against orientia tsutsugamushi using paired acute and convalescent specimens [^825ec73d]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2015). Low credibility.

We assessed the diagnostic accuracy of two immunochromatographic tests (ICTs), the Access Bio CareStart Scrub Typhus test (Somerset, NJ) (IgM), and the SD BIOLINE Tsutsugamushi test (Kyonggi-do, Republic of Korea) (IgG, IgM, or IgA) compared with indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and real-time PCR results as reference tests using 86 paired acute and convalescent specimens from febrile patients. The sensitivity and specificity of the CareStart test were 23.3% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 11.8–38.6) and 81.4% (95% CI: 66.6–91.6), respectively, for acute specimens and 32.6% (95% CI: 19.1–48.5) and 79.1% (95% CI: 64.0–90.0), respectively, for convalescent specimens. For the SD BIOLINE test, sensitivity and specificity were 20.9% (95% CI: 10.0–36.0) and 74.4% (95% CI: 58.8–86.5), respectively, for acute specimens and 76.7% (95% CI: 61.4–88.2) and 76.7% (95% CI: 61.4–88.2), respectively, for convalescent specimens. The poor sensitivity obtained for both ICTs during this study when performed on acute specimens highlights the difficulties in prompt diagnosis of scrub typhus.

### Detection of severe murine typhus by nanopore targeted sequencing, China [^eb6a458a]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

After the murine typhus diagnosis, the patient was treated with doxycycline (100 mg every 12 h) beginning on admission day 9. Soon after, her body temperature, platelet count, and blood coagulation function returned to normal. Reexamination of chest CT images showed improved pulmonary infiltrates (Figure, panels C, D), and she was discharged from the hospital. She continued doxycycline (100 mg 2×/d) for 14 days after discharge. At a 1-month follow-up, she had no symptoms of discomfort, and chest CT imaging showed resolving pulmonary infiltrates (Figure, panels E, F).

As an undifferentiated febrile illness, murine typhus can be challenging to diagnose in clinically mild or severe illness. Murine typhus can manifest with nonspecific symptoms and mimic other disease processes, making laboratory-confirmed diagnosis difficult without a high index of suspicion.

Diagnosis of murine typhus is usually performed by serologic testing and molecular analysis. Adaptation of modern serologic techniques for murine typhus diagnosis has substantially increased diagnostic accuracy, and serology was deemed the standard before the wide acceptance of molecular testing. Rickettsial infections require early diagnosis and treatment to prevent severe outcomes, but early diagnosis is rarely achieved by using serology. In addition to serology, the most common diagnostic method for murine typhus is qPCR. However, PCR has limitations, including being more sensitive during acute illness, such as the febrile phase, usually days 1–5 of illness, but possibly up to days 7–10.

NTS is a groundbreaking technology that has the potential to overcome the shortcomings of both PCR and metagenomic next-generation sequencing, and next-generation sequencing is much less affected by antimicrobial drugs than is PCR. NTS has been used clinically and has shown high specificity and sensitivity. NTS combines long read length (> 5,000 bp) and targeted amplification of 16S RNA gene for bacteria, rpoB for mycobacteria, and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) for fungi, all of which are free from interference of host background DNA. NTS can accurately detect causative pathogens in infectious samples and has a short 8–14-hour turnaround time.

In conclusion, we successfully detected R. typhi by using NTS in a febrile patient with MODS but without rash. NTS is a promising technology that can efficiently identify infectious pathogens early and has the potential to assist physicians in providing timely and precise treatment, especially for patients with nonspecific symptoms indicative of multiple disease processes.

Rickettsial infections — diagnostic testing and specimen selection emphasize serology and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Serologic testing provides retrospective confirmation and is most interpretable when acute- and convalescent-phase serum samples are compared; in these circumstances, a 2–4-fold rise in antibody titer between paired specimens taken 2–4 weeks apart (some infections require more than 28 days to develop a seroconversion) in indirect immunofluorescence antibody (IFA) assays is diagnostic. Commercial laboratories offer some serologic testing, testing is available through CDC for antigens not routinely available, and cross-reactivity can limit identification to the group or genus rather than species level. During acute illness, PCR assays and immunohistochemical analyses may be helpful; if an eschar is present, a swab or biopsy of the eschar can be evaluated by PCR to provide a species-specific diagnosis, and PCR evaluation of eschar specimens is sensitive and reliable and should be pursued. Biopsy specimens of rash lesions or whole blood can also be evaluated by PCR assays, but these specimens are generally less sensitive than eschar-derived samples due to the relatively lower concentration of rickettsial DNA, and blood is often positive by PCR only after the disease has progressed significantly and the patient is severely ill.

### Pneumonia due to scrub typhus infection: a case report [^86f13f30]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

In this case, the patient presented with fever, sputum, and cough as the main symptoms, and a diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia was initially considered, supported by serological tests and CT findings. Fever is a common symptom in many infectious diseases, including pneumonia, making it easy to overlook the possibility of scrub typhus in the early stages. While typical clinical features such as eschar can aid in diagnosis, serological tests remain the gold standard for confirming scrub typhus. Currently, the indirect immunofluorescence antibody (IFA) test is widely regarded as the diagnostic gold standard for scrub typhus. However, this test requires specialized fluorescence microscopy and trained personnel, making it unavailable in many non-endemic areas. The Weil–Felix agglutination test has limited sensitivity and specificity due to cross-reactivity with other pathogens like those causing dengue fever, malaria, and typhoid fever. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR) is highly sensitive (97%) and specific (100%) for diagnosing scrub typhus, but many laboratories, including those in China, do not routinely use this test. In this case, we confirmed the etiological detection of pulmonary infection by mNGS, because the patient's clinical manifestations were common pulmonary symptoms, so we did not obtain samples for PCR detection during bronchoscopic alveolar lavage examination. Without mNGS results, we have also neglected infection with Orientia tsutsugamushi, which may delay early diagnosis, leading to recurrent infections and delayed treatment.

Sensitivity (A) and specificity (B) of the ELISA cutoffs, and correlation (C) between reference test positivity and ELISA positivity are shown.

Correlations between reference assay positivity and ELISA positivity peaked at a cutoff of around 2.0 for all tests (Figure 2C), in agreement with the optimal cutoffs obtained using ROC curves (Table 2). Positivity using culture and eschar as the reference criteria had low (< 0.50) correlation with ELISA positivity (0.28–0.29 and 0.43–0.47 at a 2.0 OD, respectively), and this is reflected in the sensitivity and specificity results. Conversely, PCR and IFA results correlated well with ELISA results with IFA demonstrating the strongest relationship as would be expected for assays detecting the same analyte. There was a correlation of 0.88 between an ELISA admission sample cutoff of 2.0, and an IFA adm ≥ 3,200. This correlation was lower in the convalescent-phase samples (0.71 at a cutoff of 2.0).

Method 2: NTA.

Net total absorbance analysis using the sum of the OD values demonstrated a cutoff of 3.0 (66.7% sensitivity, 99.0% specificity) and 4.0 (72.7% sensitivity, 96.1% specificity) to be optimal for the admission and convalescent samples, respectively (Table 3, Figure 3).

Immunofluorescence assay methodology.

Source.

More than half of the studies did not specify the source of the IFA kits (57.7%, n = 45). Thirty-two studies (41%) specified the source of the IFA kits, of which BioMérieux (BioMérieux Ltd. Marcy-l'Étoile, Lyon, France) was the most common source used in nine studies (27.3%, 9/33). Five studies (15.2%, 5/33) used IFA methods developed by the Australian Rickettsial Reference Laboratory (ARRL), whereas five used IFA methods developed by the U.S. Army Medical Research Unit, Malaysia.

Antibody isotype.

Of the 78 studies evaluated, 61 stated the target antibody isotype, whereas 17 studies (21.8%, 17/78) did not specify the antibody isotype being targeted. The majority of the studies tested for both IgM and IgG (37.7%, 23/61) against R. typhi. Eighteen studies (29.5%, 18/61) tested exclusively for IgG, whereas nine studies (14.8%, 9/61) tested solely for IgM. Ten studies (16.4%, 10/61) performed whole antibody testing (both IgM and IgG). In one case (1.6%, 1/61), IgM, IgG, and IgA were tested for.

Antigenic composition.

A narrow range of antigens were used in the IFAs examined. More than half of the studies did not specify the antigenic strain used (67.9%, n = 53); of the 24 studies that did, the Wilmington strain was the most numerous — in 21 studies (87.5%, 21/24). Of the nine studies using BioMérieux IFAs, eight studies (88.9%, 8/9) did not specify the antigenic strain used, whereas one (11.1%, 1/9) used the Moroccan strain. Five studies used ARRL developed IFAs, of which 3 (60%, 3/5) used the Wilmington strain and two (40%, 2/5) did not specify the antigenic strain used. Five studies used IFAs developed by the U.S. Army Medical Research Unit, Malaysia, of which two (40%, 2/5) used the Wilmington strain and three (60%, 3/5) did not specify the strain used.

### Murine typhus and febrile illness, Nepal [^7d655259]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

In 2001, we found Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi and S. enterica serotype Paratyphi A to be the most common causes of bloodstream infections among adults with febrile illness who sought treatment at Patan Hospital in Kathmandu, Nepal. Another important finding was the relatively high percentage of patients (11%) who had immunoglobulin (Ig) M antibodies against Rickettsia typhi in peripheral blood. Because most testing was performed on unpaired acute-phase sera, and a high percentage of seropositive results were found in a group of healthy study participants, we were uncertain whether these participants had acute murine typhus or more distant past infection.

Recent studies have shown the value of PCR for diagnosing scrub typhus, and a real-time assay for R. typhi has recently been validated. In our study, we tested archived blood samples from our febrile adult cohort with this R. typhi PCR to better characterize the incidence of murine typhus and to determine whether clinical features could help distinguish murine typhus from enteric (typhoid) fever.

Post-travel evaluation — further laboratory testing — diagnostic testing in returning travelers should be based on the differential diagnosis, and travelers with undifferentiated fever after visiting a malaria-endemic country within the prior year should have malaria testing results available urgently, ideally within a few hours. Conventional testing for malaria should be repeated 2 or 3 times over the first 24–48 hours; nucleic acid amplification tests are more sensitive and do not need to be repeated but are not commonly available in the United States. Blood cultures should be taken, enteric fever is almost always diagnosed by appropriate blood culture, and isolation of Salmonella enterica serovars Typhi or Paratyphi is essential due to increasingly common antimicrobial resistance. Arbovirus infections are best diagnosed by RT-PCR in the acute febrile phase (a dengue rapid antigen test is also reliable); rickettsioses and leptospirosis are typically diagnosed by serology, but acute serology is not highly sensitive or specific; HIV testing should be offered to all febrile patients. When routine testing fails to yield a diagnosis, storing extra tubes of serum or whole blood for paired antibody detection or nucleic acid testing is often helpful, and respiratory specimens for a multiplex PCR respiratory virus panel should be considered in all patients with fever, coryza, and myalgia. A complete blood count with differential can detect anemia, eosinophilia, leukocytosis, leukopenia, or thrombocytopenia; thrombocytopenia is often present in dengue, malaria, and acute HIV and the total white cell count is often low or normal in malaria, dengue, and enteric fever. A complete metabolic profile, including creatinine, urea, liver enzymes, blood glucose, and coagulation screen, is frequently useful, and the risk to laboratory workers is very low, so delaying these tests is rarely indicated.

### Determination of optimal diagnostic cut-offs for the naval medical research center scrub typhus IgM ELISA in chiang rai, Thailand [^3825afa2]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2019). Medium credibility.

Abstract.

In this diagnostic accuracy study, we evaluated data from 135 febrile patients from Chiang Rai, to determine the optimal optical density (OD) cutoffs for an in-house scrub typhus IgM ELISA. Receiver operating characteristic curves were generated using a panel of reference assays, including an IgM immunofluorescence assay (IFA), PCR, in vitro isolation, presence of an eschar, or a combination of these. Altogether, 33 patients (24.4%) were diagnosed as having scrub typhus. Correlation between positivity by IFA and increasing OD values peaked at a cutoff of 2.0, whereas there was little association between positivity by culture or eschar with increasing ELISA cutoffscutoffs of 3.0 and 4.0 were demonstrated to be optimal for the total absorbance of the OD at dilutions 1:100, 1:400, 1:1,600, and 1:6,400, for admission and convalescent samples, respectively. The optimal cutoff at a 1:100 dilution was found to be between 1.85 and 2.22 for admission samples and convalescent-phase samples, respectively. Sensitivities for the cutoffs varied from 57.1% to 90.0% depending on the reference test and sample timing, whereas specificities ranged from 85.2% to 99.0%. We therefore recommend a cutoff of around 2.0, depending on the sensitivity and specificity desired in clinical or epidemiological settings. The results demonstrate the ELISA to be a valuable diagnostic tool, suitable for use in resource-limited endemic regions, especially when used in combination with other diagnostic modalities such as the presence of an eschar.

Discussion

This study examined the accuracy of the Panbio scrub typhus ICT and the murine typhus IBT in IgM formats for diagnosis of scrub and murine typhus in a prospectively recruited series of patients with typhus-like illness in an area where scrub and murine typhus are common.

The ST ICT and MT IBT had low sensitivity for accurate diagnosis of typhus for admission-phase specimens, which suggested that these rapid assays have limited usefulness for diagnosis of typhus-like illness in this disease-endemic setting. Comparison with reference IFA techniques demonstrated that much higher antibody titers than patients would normally have on admission (range = 1:3,200–12,800) were required to generate positive results in the rapid assays. Sensitivity of these assays may be improved by increasing the amount of antigen on the test strips.

The time when the sample was obtained was an important factor in accuracy of the rapid tests. The ST ICT did not show acceptable levels of sensitivity until well after the median day of presentation in this study (seven days), which was reflected in poor overall sensitivity results. This effect was less pronounced for the MT IBT.

Given that the current recommendations for treatment of scrub and murine typhus are similar, oral doxycycline for seven days, a test that would be reactive for scrub and murine typhus would be potentially useful. In this study, we investigated the applications of the MT IBT for this purpose because it demonstrated cross-reactivity for patients with scrub typhus at a level that approached that of the ST ICT. However, the sensitivity was insufficient for application with admission-phase samples.
