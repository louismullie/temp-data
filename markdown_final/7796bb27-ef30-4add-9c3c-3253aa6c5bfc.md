## Question

There is a patient with a headache located in the center of her crown and usually gets it a week after stressful events, what might it be?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what might explain a headache at the crown of the head that typically occurs about a week after stressful events. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the key clinical features and how they map to primary headache phenotypes. Then, I should verify whether any red flags are present that would push me toward secondary causes or imaging. Next, I will consider the differential diagnosis, especially tension-type headache versus migraine and post-traumatic or cervicogenic etiologies. After that, I should review the role of stress as a trigger and the timing lag. Finally, I will outline a diagnostic plan, including history, examination, and when to image, and then propose an initial management strategy with follow-up and safety netting [^117UbzHS] [^111q1eKj].

> Let me first confirm the salient features: the pain is localized to the vertex (crown), it follows stressful events by roughly a week, and there is no mention of nausea, photophobia, phonophobia, or focal neurologic symptoms, which I should explicitly verify in the history because those features change the pretest probabilities substantially [^114u9R7g] [^114N3xxx].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to check for red flags that would mandate urgent evaluation or neuroimaging, including sudden severe "thunderclap" onset, focal deficits, altered mental status, fever, cancer or immunocompromise, age over 50 with new headache, or post-traumatic onset, because these would override a primary headache diagnosis and prompt emergent workup [^114Kgub8] [^112hzPTV] [^116NggGU].

> Next, I should review the differential. Tension-type headache (TTH) rises to the top given the stress trigger and the absence of migrainous accompaniments; TTH is typically bilateral, pressing or tightening, mild to moderate, not aggravated by routine activity, and may have photophobia or phonophobia but not both and not nausea, which fits this presentation well [^116gVnvK] [^116xMp4e] [^11583tfz]. Migraine is less likely without unilateral pulsating pain, moderate to severe intensity, aggravation by activity, or associated nausea and photophobia, but I should double-check because bilateral pain can occur in migraine and some patients have atypical features, so I must keep a low threshold to reconsider if new data emerge [^112w56ZH] [^114N3xxx]. Cluster headache is unlikely given the location and lack of autonomic features or restlessness, but I should confirm there are no brief, severe, unilateral orbital/temporal attacks with ipsilateral autonomic signs before excluding it [^114FCuLU]. Cervicogenic headache is less likely without neck pain or mechanical provocation, but I should palpate the neck and assess range of motion to avoid missing it [^116rfWiK] [^117SvpLK].

> Wait, let me verify the stress–headache link and the one-week delay. Stress is among the most commonly endorsed triggers for primary headaches, with meta-analytic data showing high endorsement rates across migraine and TTH, and TTH pathophysiology includes both peripheral myofascial and central sensitization mechanisms that plausibly explain a delayed response to stressors, so a several-day lag is biologically plausible even if not universal [^114eunuV] [^113hEycj] [^115WzDKF]. I should also consider that perceived triggers are heterogeneous and method-dependent, so I need to be cautious about overinterpreting a single patient's temporal association without corroboration from a diary or repeated observations [^114eunuV].

> I will now examine the need for diagnostic testing. In a patient with a stable primary headache phenotype, normal neurologic examination, and no red flags, routine neuroimaging is not recommended; imaging is reserved for new features, neurologic deficits, suspected secondary causes, or specific high-risk scenarios per ACR and AAFP guidance, so I should avoid unnecessary CT or MRI here unless the history or exam changes [^114Kgub8] [^111q1eKj]. But wait, what if I initially thought "vertex pain could mean intracranial pathology"? Hmm, wait a minute, that would be an overcall; isolated vertex localization is not a red flag by itself, and the absence of focal signs, systemic features, or atypical evolution keeps this in the primary headache realm for now [^114Kgub8].

> Let me think about the diagnostic plan. I should confirm the headache phenotype with a structured history covering frequency, duration, pain quality, location, aggravating factors, associated symptoms, medication use, and a 4-week headache diary to capture the stress–headache relationship and medication patterns; on examination, I need a focused neurologic and head/neck exam to exclude secondary causes and screen for neck or TMJ contributors that could mimic TTH [^114u9R7g] [^116vS4H9] [^113gT4A2]. I should also screen for depression, anxiety, sleep disturbance, and medication overuse because these comorbidities worsen outcomes and influence management choices in chronic or frequent headache [^115WZnnY] [^112BfB8o].

> Next, I should review initial management. For acute episodes, simple analgesics such as acetaminophen or NSAIDs are first-line for TTH; I need to ensure use is limited to fewer than 2–3 days per week to avoid medication-overuse headache, and I should educate the patient about this threshold explicitly [^116gVnvK] [^114exB12]. For prevention of frequent or disabling episodes, I should consider nonpharmacologic strategies first — stress management, relaxation training, CBT, sleep hygiene, and exercise — and if needed, add a pharmacologic preventive such as amitriptyline or venlafaxine, chosen to match comorbidities and tolerability, with shared decision-making about risks and benefits [^116gVnvK] [^113hEycj]. I should confirm that acute and preventive strategies are coordinated and that the patient understands to treat early but not overuse medications, aligning with guideline-based care pathways [^117UbzHS].

> I should double-check follow-up and safety netting. A follow-up in 4–6 weeks to review the diary, assess response, and recheck for red flags is prudent; if the pattern evolves to include migrainous features, frequency increases toward chronicity, or new neurologic symptoms appear, I should reconsider the diagnosis and escalate evaluation accordingly, including imaging if red flags emerge or the phenotype becomes atypical for primary headache [^111q1eKj] [^114Kgub8]. If disability persists despite appropriate therapy, I should reassess for psychiatric comorbidity, sleep disorders, and medication overuse, and consider referral to neurology or headache specialty for advanced management options [^115WZnnY] [^117UbzHS].

> Putting this together, my leading diagnosis is episodic tension-type headache triggered by stress, with the one-week delay reflecting individual trigger–response dynamics and central sensitization mechanisms; the absence of migrainous or secondary features supports this, and the immediate next steps are to confirm the phenotype with a structured history and diary, screen for comorbidities, initiate acute and preventive strategies with medication-overuse education, and arrange follow-up to ensure trajectory and safety, while keeping a low threshold to re-evaluate if red flags or atypical features arise [^116gVnvK] [^116xMp4e] [^114eunuV] [^117UbzHS].

The most likely diagnosis is **tension-type headache (TTH)** [^116gVnvK] given the vertex location, stress trigger, and delayed onset. TTH is typically bilateral, pressing/tightening, mild-to-moderate, not aggravated by routine activity, and often stress-related [^116xMp4e]; the vertex is a recognized site, and a delayed onset after stress is plausible. Migraine is less likely without nausea, photophobia, or phonophobia [^117HfxPU], and cluster headache is unlikely due to the location and lack of autonomic features [^114FCuLU]. Red flags are absent, so no immediate imaging is needed [^111q1eKj]; management is reassurance, stress management, and simple analgesics as needed [^116gVnvK].

## Differential diagnosis

| **Headache type** | **Clinical features** | **Likelihood** |
|-|-|-|
| Tension-type headache (TTH) | - Bilateral <br/> - Pressing/tightening <br/> - Mild-to-moderate <br/> - Not aggravated by activity <br/> - Stress-related <br/> - Vertex location recognized [^notfound] | High |

## Pathophysiology of tension-type headache

TTH involves **peripheral myofascial nociception** and **central sensitization**, with stress as a common trigger via muscle tension and central pain modulation changes [^113hEycj] [^115WzDKF].

---

## Clinical evaluation

A thorough history and examination should confirm the diagnosis and exclude secondary causes [^111DEcPY]. Key elements include:

- **Headache characteristics**: location, quality, intensity, duration, frequency, triggers, alleviating factors [^114u9R7g].
- **Associated symptoms**: nausea, photophobia, phonophobia, autonomic features [^114N3xxx].
- **Neurological examination**: focal deficits, papilledema, neck stiffness [^112hzPTV].
- **Red flags**: sudden severe onset, progressive worsening, neurological deficits, systemic symptoms, age > 50, cancer, immunosuppression, pregnancy, postpartum, recent trauma [^114Kgub8].

---

## Diagnostic criteria (ICHD-3)

TTH is diagnosed clinically using **ICHD-3 criteria**:

- **Frequency**: ≥ 10 episodes occurring < 1 day/month on average (< 12 days/year) [^114Q1fpd].
- **Duration**: 30 minutes to 7 days [^116xMp4e].
- **Pain characteristics**: ≥ 2 of the following — bilateral location; pressing/tightening (non-pulsating) quality; mild or moderate intensity; not aggravated by routine physical activity [^114Q1fpd].
- **Associated symptoms**: no nausea or vomiting; no more than one of photophobia or phonophobia [^114Q1fpd].
- **Not better accounted for**: by another ICHD-3 diagnosis [^114Q1fpd].

---

## Management strategies

Management is **multimodal**, combining acute and preventive strategies:

- **Patient education**: explain diagnosis, triggers, and self-management [^117HYie3].
- **Stress management**: relaxation, mindfulness, CBT, biofeedback [^114exB12].
- **Acute treatment**: simple analgesics (acetaminophen, NSAIDs); limit use to avoid medication-overuse headache [^114kbUR9].
- **Preventive treatment**: consider amitriptyline or other antidepressants for frequent or chronic TTH [^116gVnvK].
- **Lifestyle modifications**: regular sleep, hydration, diet, exercise [^1175YYUU].

---

## Prognosis

TTH is **generally benign**; most patients have episodic symptoms, though some progress to chronic TTH (≥ 15 days/month for > 3 months) [^111sPLtZ]. Prognosis is influenced by stress, anxiety, depression, sleep disturbances, and medication overuse [^115WZnnY].

---

## When to consider further investigation

Further investigation is warranted if any of the following occur:

- **Change in pattern**: frequency, severity, or associated symptoms [^114Kgub8].
- **Neurological deficits**: new focal signs [^114N3xxx].
- **Red flags**: as above [^114Kgub8].
- **Failure of response**: inadequate control with appropriate therapy [^117UbzHS].

---

The most likely diagnosis is **tension-type headache** given the vertex location, stress trigger, and delayed onset. Migraine and cluster headache are less likely based on the absence of typical features, and secondary causes are unlikely without red flags. Management is reassurance, stress management, and simple analgesics, with further investigation if red flags or atypical features develop [^116gVnvK].

### Revisiting the ICHD-3 criteria for headache attributed to mild traumatic injury to the head: insights from the toronto concussion study analysis of acute headaches following concussion [^11614QxK]. Cephalalgia (2022). Medium credibility.

Given the persistence of continuous headaches in many patients and the clear overlap between symptoms of concussion (i.e. nausea, photo/phonophobia) and symptoms of headache in the acute phase post-injury, it is challenging to accurately characterize individual patients' headache phenotypes as tension-type or migraine and, as such, we chose to describe the acute PTH characteristics noted rather than try to assign primary headache phenotype labels to individual patients.

Our study identified that almost all individuals (94%) with acute PTH experience headache onset the day of the concussion or the following day and only a small minority develop headaches later within the first seven days post-injury. Further, no patients in our study endorsed a new onset acute PTH occurring beyond one-week post-injury. Accordingly, this suggests that the current ICHD-3 interval for headache onset should not be extended beyond seven days. Furthermore, the results raise the spectre of reducing the interval between injury and headache onset to less than seven days to improve diagnostic precision.

Certainly, we have all seen patients who endorse headaches that begin beyond seven days post-injury; however, it is our belief that such headaches should not be considered to be a direct sequelae of the head injury (i.e. meet criteria for acute or persistent headaches attributed to traumatic injury to the head). It is important to recognize that there are innumerable precipitants for headache and many of these provocative factors are experienced by individuals following concussion/traumatic brain injury (e.g. adverse psychological reactions to the injury-related circumstances, depressed or anxious mood, acute psychosocial or financial stressors, workplace-related stressors, narcotic medication use for concomitant polytrauma, sleep deprivation, interrupted sleep, altered sleep-wake cycles, etc.). It is highly problematic for the ICHD-3 criteria for headaches attributed to traumatic injury to the head to impugn a head injury to be directly causally related to headache onset when the headache begins more than one-week post-injury as inclusion of such individuals in ICHD diagnostic criteria is not substantiated by prospective studies. Further, inclusion of individuals with delayed onset headache is likely to effectively "muddy the waters" leading to heterogeneous patient populations making epidemiologic, clinical and pharmacologic research uninterpretable.

### Headache after concussion [^112KTCiU]. European Journal of Neurology (2009). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Chronic post-traumatic headache attributed to mild head injury is a somewhat disputed headache diagnosis. A main object of this study was to assess the validity of this diagnosis by studying the headache pattern of concussed patients that participated in one historic (n = 131) and one prospective cohort (n = 217) study.

Methods

Head injury patients were recruited from two hospitals in Kaunas, Lithuania. Controls were recruited amongst patients with minor orthopaedic traumas not involving the head and neck.

Results

When data from the two studies were pooled, no difference in any headache category (diagnosis, attack frequency, symptoms) was found one or more years after the trauma, except that photophobia was somewhat more prevalent amongst the concussed patients. In both injury groups, the existence of pre-traumatic headache was a predictor of post-traumatic headache, although pre-traumatic headache seems to have been underreported amongst the concussed patients. There was a significant negative correlation between the duration of unconsciousness and the headache.

Conclusions

This negative correlation, and the lack of specificity indicates that headache occurring 3 months or more after concussion is not caused by the head or brain injury. Rather it may represent an episode of one of the primary headaches, possibly induced by the stress of the situation.

### An individually tailored behavioral medicine treatment in physical therapy for tension-type headache-two experimental case studies [^115Lazk3]. Journal of Pain Research (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Headache disorders are common and one of the most frequent diagnoses is tension-type headache (TTH). According to the second edition of the International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD-2 and also the ICHD-3), TTH has to meet two of the following four criteria: headache 1) with a bilateral localization, 2) with pressing or tightening quality, 3) of mild to moderate intensity, and 4) which is not aggravated by routine physical activity such as walking and climbing stairs. It is also required that the person has had at least ten episodes for at least 30 minutes.

The pathophysiology of TTH is not clearly understood, but the most common trigger for TTH is psychological stress. Nash and Thebargeconcluded that psychological stress and headache are interrelated in a multifaceted way, i.e. physiologically as well as psychosocially. The relationship is mutual, since stress might predispose, trigger, and exacerbate headache, but headache might as well aggravate stress. A contributing factor to the difficulty in understanding the pathophysiology and establishing effective treatments might be that TTH is not a homogeneous disorder. History and physical examination of patients fulfilling the criteria of TTH can reveal a wide diversity of findings.

### Whiplash headache is transitory worsening of a pre-existing primary headache [^113eV46P]. Cephalalgia (2008). Low credibility.

Acute and chronic whiplash headache are new diagnostic entities in the ICHD-2 (5.3, 5.4). In a prospective cohort study, 210 rear-end collision victims were identified consecutively from police records and asked about head and neck pain in questionnaires after 2 weeks, 3 months and 1 year. The results were compared with those of matched controls who were also followed for 1 year. Of 210 accident victims, 75 developed headache within 7 days. Of these, 37 had also neck pain and complied with the criteria for acute whiplash headache. These 37 had the same headache diagnoses, headache features, accompanying symptoms and long-term prognosis as the 38 without initial neck pain who therefore did not comply with the acute whiplash headache diagnosis. Previous headache was a major risk factor for headache both in the acute and chronic stage. Compared with the non-traumatized controls, headache in the whiplash group had the same prevalence, the same diagnoses and characteristic features, and the same prognosis. Both acute and chronic whiplash headache lack specificity compared with the headache in a control group, and have the same long-term prognosis, indicating that such headaches are primary headaches, probably elicited by the stress of the situation.

### Psychiatric perspectives on headache and facial pain [^1138iHzV]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

For a subset of headache patients, an understanding of psychological antecedents and interpersonal difficulties is an important part of the headache evaluation. This subset includes patients with chronic headache, frequent headache, treatment-refractory headache, analgesic misuse problems, and serious compliance issues. Inadequate coping with stress is central to the persistence of headache in many such patients. Other patients present to the headache specialist but actually suffer from a serious comorbid psychiatric disorder, such as major depression, panic disorder, substance abuse, or personality disorder. For successful treatment of headache, it is important that these related problems be detected and either treated (as outlined here) or referred to a specialist for treatment.

Headache

Classification According to the International Headache Society, primary headaches can be classified into migraine headaches, cluster headaches and tension-type headaches. Migraine headaches result from migraine disorders, which are further categorized as migraine with aura, migraine without aura, childhood migraine or retinal migraine depending upon the presentation.– Secondary headaches may be caused due to an underlying disorder such as tumors.
Diagnosis Preliminary diagnosis can be performed through symptom assessment and detailed evaluation of patient profile and history or presence of underlying disorders. A typical migraine attack is triggered by physical activity and may be suspected if symptoms involve severe pulsating or throbbing headache on one or both sides of the head, sometimes accompanied by visual aura, sensitivity to light, nausea or vomiting. Frequently occurring migraine attacks (≥ 15 days per month for > 3 months) despite continuing medication may be regarded as chronic migraine; the duration of headache may be 4–72 hours. Tension-type headaches, also known as ordinary headaches, may be triggered by stress. The pain is usually bilateral, with pressing/tightening quality and is not usually accompanied by nausea, vomiting or light sensitivity. Persistent tension-type headache may indicate the presence of serious underlying disorders. These headaches may last from a few minutes to days (up to 7 days). Cluster headaches usually involve severe unilateral pain around the eyes (orbital pain), forehead or sides of the head (temporal pain). These headaches may last for 10 minutes to 4 hours. Diagnosis by neuroimaging techniques should be reserved for patients who have persistent pain lasting 6-month duration, often in the absence of migraine and accompanied by neurologic symptoms such as confusion, visual problems and hallucinations; also to be used in the case of patients with history of such disorders in the past (B).
Treatment Migraine headache: begin initial treatment with oral triptans (sumatriptan or zolmitriptan), followed by the antiemetics prochlorperazine or chlorpromazine in case of nausea and vomiting (A); opioids and antidepressants may be considered as second-line therapy. In children, initial treatment may be initiated with acetaminophen and ibuprofen, followed by sumatriptan nasal spray or oral triptans (A).– Cluster and tension-type headaches: treatment for cluster and tension-type headaches should consist of acetaminophen, low-dose NSAIDs (ibuprofen, naproxen and diclofenac), followed by an NSAID–caffeine or acetaminophen–caffeine combination as second-line therapy (A).–

Persistent headache attributed to traumatic injury to the head — description and diagnostic criteria include a headache of more than 3 months' duration caused by traumatic injury to the head, with criteria requiring that any headache fulfilling criteria C and D is present, traumatic injury to the head has occurred, headache is reported to have developed within 7 days after one of the following: the injury to the head, regaining of consciousness following the injury to the head, or discontinuation of medication(s) impairing ability to sense or report headache following the injury to the head; headache persists for > 3 months after its onset; and it is not better accounted for by another ICHD-3 diagnosis. Traumatic injury to the head is defined as a structural or functional injury resulting from the action of external forces upon the head, and when headache following head injury becomes persistent, the possibility of 8.2 Medication-overuse headache needs to be considered.

- fever

- neurologic deficit

- history of cancer or an immunocompromised condition

- older age (> 50 years) of onset

### Revisiting the ICHD-3 criteria for headache attributed to mild traumatic injury to the head: insights from the toronto concussion study analysis of acute headaches following concussion [^113BGvsE]. Cephalalgia (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Concussions/mild traumatic brain injuries are very common neurological injuries that can cause physical, cognitive, and psychological dysfunction. The most common acute post-concussion symptom is headache (often referred to as post-traumatic headache or PTH). The acute headache following a concussion may persist for days, weeks or months post injury. The International Headache Society Classification of Headache Disorders Third Edition (ICHD-3) diagnostic criteria 5.1 for acute headache attributed to traumatic injury to the head and 5.1.2 acute headache attributed to a mild traumatic injury to the head are outlined in Figure 1 (3). When the headaches continues for more than 3 months post-injury, ICHD-3 defines them as persistent headaches attributed to traumatic injury to the head. To meet criteria for persistent headaches attributed to traumatic injury to the head, individuals would have first had to meet criteria for acute headaches attributed to traumatic injury to the head. These ICHD-3 criteria are largely based upon the consensus opinion of an expert panel rather than being evidence-based given the paucity of data in this area. Furthermore, these criteria do not identify any characteristic or defining headache quality, location, frequency, duration, associated symptoms, triggering or aggravating factors.

In terms of onset timing, the ICHD-3 criteria require that the headache develop within 7 days after injury (or after regaining consciousness or discontinuation of medication(s) impairing ability to sense or report headache). There has been debate regarding the validity of this time frame with some suggesting that the interval should be shorter and others suggesting that the interval should be extended out as far as thirty days post-injury or longer (3,6,7); indeed the appendix of the ICHD-3 proposes research criteria that extend the interval between traumatic injury to the head and headache onset out to ninety days (so called "delayed-onset" headache attributed to traumatic injury to the head). These divergent views demonstrate the need to evaluate and field-test the diagnostic criteria.

Despite its high prevalence, relatively little is known about acute and persistent PTH in terms of the epidemiology, headache characteristics, predictive factors for headache recovery or persistence, imaging correlates, and the role of genetics. The pathophysiology of acute PTH is not well understood. PTH results from physical forces that may precipitate headache de novo in a non-headache prone individual, initiate a new headache type in someone with pre-injury episodic or chronic headaches, or may exacerbate an existing primary headache disorder.

### 2023 U.S. department of veterans affairs and U.S. department of defense clinical practice guideline for the management of headache [^112YUVsu]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Acute headache attributed to traumatic injury to the head — description and diagnostic criteria are as follows: Headache of less than 3 months' duration caused by traumatic injury to the head and/or neck, with any headache fulfilling criteria C and D, and traumatic injury to the head has occurred. Headache is reported to have developed within 7 days after one of: the injury to the head; regaining of consciousness following the injury to the head; or discontinuation of medication(s) impairing ability to sense or report headache following the injury to the head. Either headache has resolved within 3 months after its onset or headache has not yet resolved but 3 months have not yet passed since its onset, and it is not better accounted for by another ICHD-3 diagnosis. Traumatic injury to the head is defined as a structural or functional injury resulting from the action of external forces upon the head, including impact between the head and an object, penetration of the head by a foreign body, forces generated from blasts or explosions, and other forces yet to be defined.

### Post-traumatic headache attributed to traumatic brain injury: classification, clinical characteristics, and treatment [^117G7P2i]. The Lancet: Neurology (2021). High credibility.

Post-traumatic headache is a common sequela of traumatic brain injury and is classified as a secondary headache disorder. In the past 10 years, considerable progress has been made to better understand the clinical features of this disorder, generating momentum to identify effective therapies. Post-traumatic headache is increasingly being recognised as a heterogeneous headache disorder, with patients often classified into subphenotypes that might be more responsive to specific therapies. Such considerations are not accounted for in three iterations of diagnostic criteria published by the International Headache Society. The scarcity of evidence-based approaches has left clinicians to choose therapies on the basis of the primary headache phenotype (eg, migraine and tension-type headache) and that are most compatible with the clinical picture. A concerted effort is needed to address these shortcomings and should include large prospective cohort studies as well as randomised controlled trials. This approach, in turn, will result in better disease characterisation and availability of evidence-based treatment options.

### Managing headache triggers: think' coping' not' avoidance' [^112ugjnZ]. Cephalalgia (2010). Low credibility.

The standard clinical advice for individuals who suffer from recurrent headaches is that the best way to prevent headaches is to avoid the triggers. This editorial challenges that advice from a number of perspectives. First, there is little empirical support for such advice. Second, cognate literatures in the fields of chronic pain, stress and anxiety raise concerns about avoidance as a strategy. Third, studies have demonstrated that short exposure to a headache trigger results in increased sensitivity and prolonged exposure results in decreased sensitivity. Conclusions include that one aetiological pathway to developing a primary headache disorder may be via attempts to avoid triggers resulting in increased sensitivity to triggers. Also, clinicians need to become more flexible in the advice they give pertaining to triggers, namely they should think 'coping with triggers' rather than avoiding all triggers, as avoidance will sometimes be the preferred strategy, but often it will not be.

### Pitfalls in the management of headache in the emergency department [^112mHou6]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

Headache is the fifth most common primary complaint of patients presenting to an emergency department (ED) in the United States. The emergency physician (EP) plays a unique role in the management of these patients, one that differs from that of the primary care physician, the neurologist, and other specialists. Diagnostic nomenclature used in the ED is necessarily less specific, as care is more appropriately focused on the relief of symptoms and the identification of life-threatening causes. By seeking a limited number of specific critical features on history and physical examination, the EP can minimize the risk of overlooking one of these dangerous causes of headache. When certain features are present, empirical therapies and diagnostic testing should be initiated in the ED. The most frequently encountered pitfalls in the management of patients with headache in emergency medicine practice, and those with the greatest likelihood to adversely affect patient outcomes, are discussed.

### Assessment and management of tension-type headaches [^1175YYUU]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

Tension-type headache (TTH) is a bilateral, nonthrobbing, band-like headache considered the most common headache disorder and prevalent neurologic disorder worldwide. Despite the widespread prevalence of TTH, the pathophysiology remains elusive, with current research indicating a complex mix of physiologic, psychological, and environmental systems that contribute to the initiation and perpetuation of TTH. The mainstay treatment for acute episodes includes simple analgesics, while more chronic and frequent episodes require preventative therapy with lifestyle and behavioral modification, psychobehavioral treatments, integrative health, and pharmacologic therapy such as tricyclic agents or antidepressants.

### Disability from posttraumatic headache is compounded by coexisting posttraumatic stress disorder [^1132G8KA]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Patients who have suffered TBI may have symptoms of PTSD. PTSD is a syndrome defined by the DSM-IV as a disorder related to actual or perceived harm to the individual or a close relative/friend or repeated exposure to aversive details of a traumatic event. Symptoms include intrusive memories, distressing dreams, flashbacks, psychological distress, and physiological adverse reactions. Reported prevalence of PTSD symptoms following TBI varies widely from 6% to 39% across both military and civilian populations. Headache may hinder recovery from the cognitive and behavioral consequences of TBI. Patients frequently have both PTH and PTSD symptoms, but the relationship between the symptoms is less defined.

In this study, we primarily hypothesize that headache disability following TBI is worsened by PTSD. Furthermore, we look at other factors that are associated with headache disability post-TBI.

### 2023 U.S. department of veterans affairs and U.S. department of defense clinical practice guideline for the management of headache [^111DEcPY]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Secondary headache disorders — evaluation and scope — should prioritize identifying a secondary cause versus a primary headache, consider emergent evaluation for red flags, and apply dual diagnoses when a preexisting headache is worsened by a causative disorder; this guideline addresses three secondary types. "The initial evaluation of patients with headache should focus on determining whether a secondary cause for the headache exists or whether a primary headache diagnosis is appropriate". "Emergent evaluation should be considered based on the presence of red flag features". "In general, a secondary headache can be diagnosed if the headache is new and occurs in close temporal relation to another disorder known to cause headache or when a preexisting headache disorder significantly worsens in close temporal relation to a causative disorder". "In instances where a preexisting headache disorder is worsened by a causative disorder, both the primary and secondary headache diagnoses should be given (e.g., migraine and medication overuse headache [MOH])". The CPG addresses "cervicogenic headache, posttraumatic headache (PTH) (described in the ICHD-3 as a headache attributed to traumatic injury to the head, neck, or both), and MOH", and notes these types "are the most encountered".

This systematic review and meta-analysis examined the extent of delay between first experiencing symptoms related to GCA and receiving a confirmatory GCA diagnosis, finding the mean time-period of diagnostic delay to be 9 weeks. Also of interest was how diagnostic delay is influenced by GCA-specific characteristics. Here, we found that even when patients present with distinct cranial symptoms, the delay in finally receiving a GCA diagnosis remains substantial (8 weeks) and is longer still for those with non-cranial symptoms (18 weeks). Such findings are of concern, as previous research has reported that as few as half of GCA patients can experience temporal headaches.

Achieving a prompt and accurate diagnosis of GCA remains challenging, demonstrated by typically wide and skewed time-periods of delay within individual studies. It was not uncommon for time-periods of delay to range from a single day in one patient, to a year in another from the same study. Further research is needed to fully describe the characteristics of patients experiencing both short and long periods of delay. When a patient presents to the clinician with mainly constitutional symptoms, such as fever or malaise, diagnosis is more challenging as these symptoms are common and frequently occur in other, more prevalent disorders. However, patients who present with classic cranial GCA or typically associated symptoms (e.g. headache, PMR) still experience a prolonged period of diagnostic delay, highlighting the need for an increased awareness of all facets of this condition.

### Orofacial pain management: current perspectives [^117HYie3]. Journal of Pain Research (2014). Low credibility.

Nonpharmacological approaches

Patients need to be educated about the pain they are experiencing. When the pain is localized in the lower half of the face and/or in a tooth/teeth area (facial migraine), the patient should be assured that, even though the experienced pain may be severe and throbbing, it is not a toothache or related dental problem. This is extremely important since it will prevent unnecessary dental procedures due to misdiagnosis as odontogenic toothache or other orofacial pain.

Facial migraine is the same migraine headache described in the ICDH-3 (beta version) but with a different localization, therefore requiring that the same management protocol be followed. It is recommended to have the patient identify any trigger factors that may start the migraine attack. A good method by which the patient can provide this information is with the use of a pain diary, in which the patient keeps a record of the characteristics of the headache episodes along with the circumstances that made them appear. As soon as the patient can identify the possible triggers, then they are instructed to avoid or address them by, for example, a change in diet, sleep hygiene, or stress management. This is a great opportunity for the patient to realize that lifestyle changes may greatly influence their headaches and subsequently feel more in control of the disorder.

Other nonpharmacological methods that have proved useful for migraine and TTH are biofeedback, relaxation techniques, hypnosis, and psychological therapies.

Pharmacological approaches

As described above, the TNC is a crucial anatomical relay center for conveying sensory information, predominantly nociceptive, coming from the orofacial region, the head and its cranial vasculature, to higher pain processing centers in the brain; in addition, it gives and receives projections from the superior salivatory nucleus and structures from the descending inhibitory system, such as the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray and rostral ventromedial medulla. These anatomical connections have positioned the TNC as a therapeutical target to potentially decrease or inhibit trigeminovascular nociceptive activation and further sensitization.

The same medications used for the management of migraine are used for the management of facial migraine, since it is the same disorder and same pathophysiology but different headache localization (face). If the migraine attack occurs less than twice per month, then an abortive medication should be considered. If the migraine attack is more frequent, it is best managed with preventive medications.

### Headache in the emergency department: avoiding misdiagnosis of dangerous secondary causes, an update [^112hzPTV]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

In the initial assessment of the headache patient, the emergency physician must consider several dangerous secondary causes of headache. A thorough history and physical examination, along with consideration of a comprehensive differential diagnosis may alert the emergency physician to the diagnosis of a secondary headache particularly when the history is accompanied by any of the following clinical features: sudden/severe onset, focal neurologic deficits, altered mental status, advanced age, active or recent pregnancy, coagulopathy, malignancy, fever, visual deficits, and/or loss of consciousness.

### Headache and facial pain: differential diagnosis and treatment [^111nG9ry]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2013). Low credibility.

Headaches affect 90% of the population sometime during their life. Most are benign and fleeting, some are serious and life-threatening, and others require ongoing medical consultation and treatment. A careful history and physical is necessary to establish a differential diagnosis and to guide the choice of testing to make an accurate diagnosis. The most common types of headaches are discussed in this review. They are divided into primary and secondary headache disorders as classified by the International Headache Society. Primary headache disorders include migraine without and with aura, cluster and tension-type headaches. Secondary headaches are those that occur as a result of some other disorder and include brain tumors, rhinosinusitis, diseases of intracranial and extracranial vasculature, and temporomandibular joint disease.

### Stress and tension-type headache mechanisms [^115WzDKF]. Cephalalgia (2010). Low credibility.

Stress is widely demonstrated as a contributing factor in tension-type headache (TTH). The mechanisms underlying this remain unclear at present. Recent research indicates the importance of central pain processes in tension-type headache (TTH) pathophysiology. Concurrently, research with animals and healthy humans has begun to elucidate the relationship between stress and pain processing in the central nervous system, including central pain processes putatively dysfunctional in TTH. Combined, these two fields of research present new insights and hypotheses into possible mechanisms by which stress may contribute to TTH. To date, however, there has been no comprehensive review of this literature. The present paper provides such a review, which may be valuable in facilitating a broader understanding of the central mechanisms by which stress may contribute to TTH.

### Diagnostic challenges in vestibular migraine-clinical differentiation from menière's disease and discrepancies with current classification criteria [^116QAYL4]. Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Suspected VM — indicators of disagreement of clinical expert evaluation and ICVD criteria

VM is simple to diagnose if (1) the attacks are always or mostly followed by migraine-type headache and (2) the patient has a positive personal history of a migraine as defined by the criteria of the International Headache Classification. Establishing the diagnosis, however, may prove difficult, if the symptom features are more ambiguous. VM often is considered the chameleon among the episodic vestibular syndromes. There are several reasons for this: headache is absent in about 30% of patients, the characteristics of vertigo may be diverse and may vary (also in severity), vertigo attacks may last from seconds to several days, and MD may coincide with VM.

Despite the current plethora of literature on VM several questions remain unsolved. The occurrence of symptoms such as hypersensitivity to light and sound, a need for quiet environments, tiredness after the attack, an urge to urinate, and a pronounced susceptibility to motion sickness may support the clinical diagnosis of VM. However, these 'soft' criteria are currently not included in the ICVD diagnostic framework. Nevertheless, these clinical signs are often decisive in cases where the diagnosis of VM is challenging. In our study we had classified 66 patients as 'suspected VM' according to our clinical assessment although they did not fulfill ICVD criteria, underscoring the limitations of current diagnostic guidelines. This was primarily due to atypical symptoms, deviating attack duration, central ocular motor abnormalities, and additional VM-related triggers. In detail these were bilateral or occipital headache localization, accompanying symptoms such as a need for rest or paresthesia in the facial area, triggers such as stress, lack of sleep or hormone association, and a positive family history being particularly indicative.

### Reason to doubt the ICHD-3 7-day inclusion criterion for mild TBI-related posttraumatic headache: a nested cohort study [^1147Ld6r]. Cephalalgia (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Posttraumatic headache is difficult to define and there is debate about the specificity of the 7-day headache onset criterion in the current definition. There is limited evidence available to guide decision making about this criterion.

Method

A nested cohort study of 193 treatment-seeking veterans who met criteria for persistent headache attributed to mild traumatic injury to the head, including some veterans with delayed headache onset up to 90 days post-injury, was undertaken. Survival analysis examined the proportion of participants reporting headache over time and differences in these proportions based on sex, headache phenotype, and mechanism of injury.

Result

127 participants (66%; 95% CI: 59–72%) reported headache onset within 7 days of head injury and 65 (34%) reported headache onset between 8 days and 3 months after head injury. Fourteen percent of participants reported pre-existing migraine before head injury, and there was no difference in the proportion of veterans with pre-existing migraine based on headache onset. Headache onset times were not associated with sex, headache phenotype, or mechanism of injury. There were no significant differences in proportion of veterans with headache onset within 7 days of head injury based on headache phenotype (70% migraine onset within 7 days, 70% tension-type headache within 7 days, 56% cluster headache within 7 days; p ≥ .364). Similar findings were observed for head injury (64% blast, 60% blunt; p = .973). There were no significant differences observed between headache onset groups for psychiatric symptoms (Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist for DSM-5 = 1.3, 95% CI = -27.5, 30.1; Patient Health Questionnaire-9 Item = 3.5, 95% CI = -6.3, 3.7; Generalized Anxiety Disorder Screener = 6.5, 95% CI = -2.7, 15.6).

Conclusions

Although most of the sample reported headache onset within 7 days of head injury, one-third experienced an onset outside of the diagnostic range. Additionally, veterans with headache onset within 7 days of head injury were not meaningfully different from those with later onset based on sex, headache phenotype, or mechanism of head injury. The ICHD-3 diagnostic criteria for 7-day headache onset should be expanded to 3 months.

### Acute migraine management in children [^111qZASn]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2015). Low credibility.

Migraines are common, incapacitating, and often stress inducing for pediatric patients and parents alike. According to the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, more than 1 million Americans seek emergency care every year due to migraines, with increasing frequency among adolescents. The disease can vary in severity and character, often mimicking life-threatening conditions, requiring prompt nuanced recognition by emergency personnel and implementation of an effective treatment strategy. Development of emergency department guidelines for the management of pediatric migraines should be based on up-to-date evidence supporting safe, appropriate therapies for children.

### Long-term persistent headache after SARS-CoV-2 infection: a follow-up population-based study [^115K1bkA]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

COVID‐19 is associated with persistent neurological symptoms and/or late‐onset complications, collectively referred to as "post‐COVID syndrome". This syndrome includes symptoms such as headache, cognitive dysfunction, insomnia, and fatigue, among others. Headache is one of the most frequent neurological symptoms during the acute phase of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, but it can also persist for months after infection. The terms "post‐COVID headache" and "persistent headache after COVID‐19" describe any chronic headache with an onset temporally linked to confirmed SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines post‐COVID‐19 conditions as if it "occurs in individuals with a history of probable or confirmed SARSCoV‐2 infection, usually 3 months from the onset of COVID‐19 with symptoms that last for at least 2 months and cannot be explained by an alternative diagnosis". Headache has been included among these symptoms, either as a new onset headache following recovery from the acute phase of COVID‐19 or as a persistent headache since the initial illness. Such headaches are often moderate to severe in intensity, refractory to treatment, and can become long‐lasting, persisting for up to 9 months. Given the high prevalence of primary headache disorders, such as migraine, in the general population, it is expected that worsening or changes in headache patterns could be common among those with pre‐existing headache disorders during COVID‐19 infection. However, this is not typically categorized as part of the long‐COVID syndrome, due to the multiple factors influencing migraines, including stress‐related psychosocial factors such as disrupted sleep and dietary habits, increased anxiety and depressive symptoms, and the possible presence of a nocebo effect, which can affect migraine patterns.

We took advantage of an ongoing prospective study of COVID‐19 patients to characterize de novo persistent headaches and assess patient characteristics over a 24‐month follow‐up period. We aim to characterize de novo headache 2 years after SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, specifically, de novo persistent headache incidence, and describe those meeting migraine‐like features.

### Tackling chronic migraine: current perspectives [^114WgCbV]. Journal of Pain Research (2014). Low credibility.

In the last decade, several diagnostic criteria and definitions have been proposed for chronic migraine (CM). The third edition of the International Classification of Headache Disorders–3 beta, published in 2013, has revised CM diagnostic criteria. CM is defined as "headache occurring on 15 or more days per month for more than 3 months, which has the features of migraine headache on at least 8 days per month". Patients who meet the criteria for CM and for medication-overuse headache should be given both diagnoses. Worldwide, CM prevalence ranges 1%–3%, and its incidence has been estimated to be 2.5% per year. CM is associated with disability and poor quality of life. Modifiable risk factors include (among others): migraine progression (defined as an increase in frequency and severity of migraine attacks); medication and caffeine overuse; obesity; stressful life events; and snoring. CM patients have a significantly higher frequency of some comorbid conditions, including chronic pain, psychiatric disorders, respiratory illness, and some vascular risk factors. Management includes identification and control of comorbidities and risk factors that predispose to CM; treatment and prevention for medication overuse; early treatment for migraine attacks; and an adequate preventive therapy for CM. Several randomized controlled clinical trials have shown the efficacy of topiramate, amitriptyline, onabotulinumtoxinA, and cognitive-behavioral therapy in CM.

### Does this patient with headache have a migraine or need neuroimaging? [^114N3xxx]. JAMA (2006). Excellent credibility.

Context

In assessing the patient with headache, clinicians are often faced with 2 important questions: Is this headache a migraine? Does this patient require neuroimaging? The diagnosis of migraine can direct therapy, and information obtained from the history and physical examination is used by physicians to determine which patients require neuroimaging.

Objective

To determine the usefulness of the history and physical examination that distinguish patients with migraine from those with other headache types and that identify those patients who should undergo neuroimaging.

Data Sources and Study Selection

A systematic review was performed using articles from MEDLINE (1966-November 2005) that assessed the performance characteristics of screening questions in diagnosing migraine (with the International Headache Society diagnostic criteria as a gold standard) and addressed the accuracy of the clinical examination in predicting the presence of underlying intracranial pathology (with computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging as the reference standard).

Data Extraction

Two authors independently reviewed each study to determine eligibility, abstract data, and classify methodological quality using predetermined criteria. Disagreement was resolved by consensus with a third author.

Data Synthesis

Four studies of screening questions for migraine (n = 1745 patients) and 11 neuroimaging studies (n = 3725 patients) met inclusion criteria. All 4 of the migraine studies illustrated high sensitivity and specificity if 3 or 4 criteria were met. The best predictors can be summarized by the mnemonic POUNDing (Pulsating, duration of 4–72 hOurs, Unilateral, Nausea, Disabling). If 4 of the 5 criteria are met, the likelihood ratio (LR) for definite or possible migraine is 24 (95% confidence interval, 1.5–388); if 3 are met, the LR is 3.5 (95% CI, 1.3–9.2), and if 2 or fewer are met, the LR is 0.41 (95% CI, 0.32–0.52). For the neuroimaging question, several clinical features were found on pooled analysis to predict the presence of a serious intracranial abnormality: cluster-type headache (LR, 10.7; 95% CI, 2.2–52); abnormal findings on neurologic examination (LR, 5.3; 95% CI, 2.4–12); undefined headache (ie, not cluster-, migraine-, or tension-type) (LR, 3.8; 95% CI, 2.0–7.1); headache with aura (LR, 3.2; 95% CI, 1.6–6.6); headache aggravated by exertion or a valsalva-like maneuver (LR, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.4–3.8); and headache with vomiting (LR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.2–2.6). No clinical features were useful in ruling out significant pathologic conditions.

Conclusions

The presence of 4 simple historical features can accurately diagnose migraine. Several individual clinical features were found to be associated with a significant intracranial abnormality, and patients with these features should undergo neuroimaging.

Primary headache disorders are common within the pediatric population and often lead to disruption in multiple areas of life. It is important to systematically approach patients presenting for the evaluation of headaches to determine if the symptoms originate from a primary or secondary headache disorder. Once a diagnosis is established, patients should be offered treatment to adequately address the headache disorder. Over the last 6 years, multiple new treatment options have emerged, with growing selections available for children and adolescents. In this review, we discuss the evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment approach to primary headache disorders.

### Diagnosis and management of migraine in ten steps [^112w56ZH]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2021). High credibility.

Step 1: When to suspect migraine

In the third edition of the International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD-3), migraine is classified into three main types: migraine without aura, migraine with aura, and chronic migraine. The clinical characteristics of each must be considered to ensure an accurate diagnosis.

Migraine without aura

Migraine without aura is characterized by recurrent headache attacks that last 4–72 h. Typical features of an attack include a unilateral location, pulsating quality, moderate or severe pain intensity, and aggravation by routine physical activity. However, bilateral pain is not uncommon; population-based data indicate that ~40% of individuals with migraine report bilateral pain during attacks. The most common associated symptoms are photophobia, phonophobia, nausea and vomiting. Before the onset of pain, prodromal symptoms can include a depressed mood, yawning, fatigue and cravings for specific foods. After resolution of the headache, postdromal symptoms can last up to 48 h and often include tiredness, concentration difficulties and neck stiffness.

Migraine with aura

Approximately one third of individuals with migraine experience aura, either with every attack or with some attacks. Aura is defined as transient focal neurological symptoms that usually precede, but sometimes accompany, the headache phase of a migraine attack. In > 90% of affected individuals, aura manifests visually, classically as fortification spectra. Sensory symptoms occur in ~31% of affected individuals and are usually experienced as predominantly unilateral paraesthesia (pins and needles and/or numbness) that spreads gradually in the face or arm.

Less common aura symptoms include aphasic speech disturbance, brainstem symptoms (such as dysarthria and vertigo), motor weakness (in hemiplegic migraine) and retinal symptoms (for example, repeated monocular visual disturbances). Aura symptoms can be similar to those of transient ischaemic attacks (TIA), but can be differentiated on the basis that aura symptoms often spread gradually (over ≥ 5 min) and occur in succession, whereas symptoms of a TIA have a sudden, simultaneous onset.

Notably, migraine with aura and migraine without aura can coexist. Many individuals with migraine with aura also experience attacks that are not preceded by aura. In such cases, migraine with aura and migraine without aura should both be diagnosed.

### Perceived triggers of primary headache disorders: a meta-analysis [^114eunuV]. Cephalalgia (2018). Low credibility.

Objective To quantitatively synthesize extant literature on perceived triggers of primary headache disorders. Methods A meta-analytic review of headache trigger survey studies was conducted. Endorsement rates, assessment method, and headache and sample characteristics were extracted from included articles. Separate random-effects models were used to assess trigger endorsement rates and post-hoc meta-regressions examined potential moderator variables. Results 85 articles from 1958 to 2015 were included, involving 27,122 participants and querying 420 unique triggers (collapsed into 15 categories). Four-fifths (0.81; 95% CI .75 to .86) of individuals with migraine or tension-type headache endorsed at least one trigger. Rates increased with the number of categories queried (OR: 1.18, 1.08–1.30) and year of publication (OR: 1.04, 1.00–1.08). The triggers most commonly endorsed were stress (.58, .53-.63) and sleep (.41, .36-.47). Conclusions Extreme heterogeneity characterizes the headache trigger literature. Most individuals with a primary headache disorder perceive their attacks to be triggered by one or more precipitants, the most common of which are stress and sleep. However, trigger endorsement is influenced by method of assessment. Enhancing methodological consistency and prioritizing experimental studies would improve our understanding of headache triggers.

### Disability from posttraumatic headache is compounded by coexisting posttraumatic stress disorder [^114sRkNw]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

This study is limited by the collection of data at a single time point, and future studies evaluating longitudinal changes will be valuable. Moreover, it is important to understand that although we have identified that the degree of headache disability after brain trauma is associated with PTSD symptoms, this does not imply causation; however, it would be of interest to evaluate whether treatment of PTSD improves headache disability. Furthermore, it would have been interesting to note familial and prior history of migraine, although this was not the primary focus of this study. In future research, a collection of prospective headache diaries, which includes monitoring of headache frequency and severity over time in relation to severity of PTSD symptoms, would be valuable.

### Risk factors for migraine disease progression: a narrative review for a patient-centered approach [^114RNz74]. Journal of Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Protective actions for comorbidity risk factors

Comorbidity management is an important component of a migraine management strategy and should be guided by a collaborative patient‒clinician decision-making paradigm. Referral to a specialist and multidisciplinary providers may be appropriate depending upon comorbidities and patient variables. While there are several comorbidities associated with migraine progression, there is limited direct evidence to suggest that treating comorbidities will decrease progression. Nevertheless, increased attention to the management of the most significant known comorbidities associated with migraine progression (e.g. depression, anxiety, chronic pain, history of head or neck injury, metabolism-related comorbidities, sleep disturbances, allergic rhinitis, asthma, female sex, hormones) represent a reasonable approach to mitigating the risk of progression and should not be overlooked.

Education on the risks of medication overuse should be offered routinely to all patients with migraine but should be based on individual circumstances. Motivational interviewing and reinforcement of positive behaviors can affect behavioral changes and promote positive relationships. Such initiatives are designed to stimulate patients' desire to change and give them the confidence to do so, but they can be challenging to implement, as this requires an entirely different perspective on the nature of the clinician's role.

Protective actions for lifestyle/exogenous risk factors

Although evidence demonstrates that lifestyle and exogenous factors are related to increasing MHDs, there is little research on potential interventions. These are the areas where expert opinion offers supportive insight. While the protective actions below are described from a migraine standpoint, lifestyle and exogenous factors should be attended to regardless of their possible relation to migraine disease and its progression.

Stress in many forms influences migraine, including stress from adverse childhood events, stressful life events, ongoing financial constraints, and previous assault. Individuals with stress could benefit from approaches such as stress management, CBT, biofeedback, relaxation training, exercise, social support, or fostering resilience to reduce the frequency of migraine based on their individual needs. Several of these approaches (CBT, biofeedback, relaxation training) already have evidence supporting their use for migraine management, but not specifically within the context of stress.

### Disability from posttraumatic headache is compounded by coexisting posttraumatic stress disorder [^116vJcr6]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusion

We demonstrate, in a population with predominant mild TBI, that headache disability is greatest in those with PTSD symptoms. This is in agreement with studies suggesting that emotional health can impact headache disability. Moreover, headache disability is increased in individuals who are younger or lose consciousness at the time of injury. We suggest that in patients with chronic PTH, identifying and treating PTSD may be beneficial for headache management.

Clinical implications

Patients with chronic PTH have greater headache disability if they also have PTSD.
Younger patients who lose consciousness at the time of injury may have the most disability from chronic PTH.
In patients with chronic PTH and PTSD, headache disability might be improved if PTSD is actively managed alongside headache management.

AbstractMorning Report is a time-honored tradition where physicians-in-training present cases to their colleagues and clinical experts to collaboratively examine an interesting patient presentation. The Morning Report section seeks to carry on this tradition by presenting a patient's chief concern and story, inviting the reader to develop a differential diagnosis and discover the diagnosis alongside the authors of the case. This report examines the story of a 36-year-old man who sought evaluation for a persistent headache and numbness on the cheek. Using questions, physical examination, and testing, an illness script for the presentation emerges. As the clinical course progresses, the differential is refined until a diagnosis is made.

Migraine and tension headaches are among the most common diagnoses in women's health. Secondary causes of headache such as brain tumor, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and meningitis are uncommon but must not be missed. A careful history and physical examination, use of diagnostic criteria, and certain facts about the serious causes of headache are the keys to diagnosis and treatment. Neuroimaging should be limited to patients displaying signs or symptoms of a secondary headache cause. Menstrual migraine can be managed similarly to nonmenstrual migraine.

### Debunking myths in headache diagnosis for the pain practitioner [^1175w64y]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

With headache being one of the most common chief complaints, it is essential for pain practitioners to interpret and differentiate a variety of headache characteristics to accurately diagnose and treat specific headache disorders. Certain misconceptions often lead to misdiagnosis. This article presents and discusses six myths about several common headache disorders (migraine, tension-type headache, cluster headache, cervicogenic headache, sinus headache, and occipital neuralgia) often encountered in clinical practice. The discussion is based primarily on the International Classification of Headache Disorders, 3rd edition and the latest studies. Recognizing and understanding the intricacies behind key headache diagnoses will help providers devise appropriate plans to better care for their patients.

Posttraumatic headache (PTH) in Veterans and active duty Service members — the incidence of mTBI and concurrent headache in this population is four to five times higher than that in the general U.S. population. The financial impact of the diagnosis and treatment of mTBI in active duty Service members is estimated to range from $95 million to nearly $150 million. Specifically, blast-related headaches have been shown to account for 60% of post-deployment headaches, and 81% of all deployed active duty Service members reporting a concussion also report a headache, and in active duty Service members and Veterans, the diagnosis and treatment of PTH can be complicated by the high prevalence of comorbidities such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and cognitive, sleep, and other behavioral health disorders.

### Sinus headache or migraine? Considerations in making a differential diagnosis [^113zc5qh]. Neurology (2002). Low credibility.

Sinus headache is commonly diagnosed, and patients with headache often cite sinus pain and pressure as a cause of their headaches. A high frequency of diagnosis of sinus headache, which specialists consider to be relatively rare, among patients meeting International Headache Society (IHS) diagnostic criteria for migraine raises the possibility that migraine and perhaps other headache types are sometimes mistaken for sinus headache. This article considers clinical, epidemiologic, and pathophysiologic relationships between sinus headache and migraine and discusses the implications for clinical management of headache. Both historic and new data show that nasal symptoms frequently accompany migraine, although these symptoms are not part of the IHS diagnostic criteria for migraine. Parasympathetic activation, as well as the hypothesized mechanism of neurogenic or immunogenic switching (i.e., crossover interactions of neurogenic and immunogenic inflammation), may account for both the frequent occurrence of nasal symptoms in migraine and the possibility that sinus inflammation can sometimes act as a migraine trigger. Considered in aggregate, the data show that the occurrence of nasal symptoms associated with a headache should neither trigger a diagnosis of sinus disease nor exclude a diagnosis of migraine. It should, in fact, prompt diagnostic consideration of both conditions.

Postdromal symptoms, following headache resolution, are said to constitute a distinct phase of the migraine attack. We question the evidence for this, with regard both to the nature of such symptoms and to how often they are reported to occur.

Methods

We searched the Pubmed and Embase databases for relevant articles from their inception until 25 May 2023. We included observational studies recording the proportions of participants with migraine reporting one or more postdromal symptoms or specific individual symptoms. Two reviewers independently screened studies for relevance (agreeing on those to be included), extracted data and assessed risk of bias. Data were analyzed using random-effects meta-analysis to establish the proportions of those with migraine reporting one or more postdromal symptoms, whether among the general population or patients in clinic-based samples.

Results

Large majorities of participants in either case reported postdromal symptoms: 97% in the only population-based study, and a mean of 86% (95% CI: 71–94%) in four clinic-based studies. The most commonly reported specific symptoms were fatigue (52%; 95% CI: 44–60%), concentration difficulties (35%; 95% CI: 14–65%) and mood changes (29%; 95% CI: 9–64%), none of these being clearly described. These estimates could not be considered reliable: they were subject to substantial study heterogeneity, none of the studies applied International Classification of Headache Disorders definitions of postdromal symptoms, and all had high risk of bias.

Conclusion

Postdromal symptoms in migraine appear to be very commonly reported, but the data are unreliable with regard both to their nature and to how often they occur. Further studies are needed to conclude that they constitute a distinct phase of migraine.

Frequent episodic tension-type headache — frequent episodes of headache are typically bilateral, pressing or tightening in quality and of mild to moderate intensity, lasting minutes to days; pain does not worsen with routine physical activity and is not associated with nausea, although photophobia or phonophobia may be present. Diagnostic criteria require at least 10 episodes of headache occurring on 1–14 days/month on average for > 3-months (≥ 12 and < 180-days/year) and fulfilling criteria B-D, with episodes lasting from 30-minutes to 7-days and at least two of the following: bilateral location; pressing or tightening (non-pulsating) quality; mild or moderate intensity; not aggravated by routine physical activity such as walking or climbing stairs.

### The epidemiology of airplane headache: a cross-sectional study on point prevalence and characteristics in 50, 000 travelers [^115MRFYc]. Cephalalgia (2022). Medium credibility.

Proposal for amending the diagnostic criteria for airplane headache

AH can only be diagnosed if the criteria of the ICHD are met. However, the current ICHD-3 reflects mainly data derived from earlier case series and cohort studies, which may be subject to relevant selection bias, as explained above. Consequently, we believe that these diagnostic criteria are not truly representative of all patients suffering from this distinct disorder.

Per our results, several passengers suffering from headaches during air travel do not meet the long-established criteria of any primary headache type, but also cannot be classified as AH, even though the similarities are often striking. Classification is often hindered by sub-criteria that seem too strict and without pathophysiological substance.

Considering the vast inter-individual differences in both the quantity and quality of pain, we would like to initiate a discussion on the current ICHD-3 criteria for AH with the aim to widen the ICHD-3 criteria for AH to represent more accurately all individuals affected by this disorder.

Our reasoning is as follows:
Currently, there are no proven pathophysiological mechanisms or anatomical correlations for the development of AH. Any localization from the forehead to the occiput, left and right, and uni- and bilateral should be considered as compatible with AH.
Travelers suffering from AH may undergo only a few episodes and may never seek medical attention. Perhaps this inexperience with headaches may lead to imprecise formal descriptions of pain quality. While experience and precision may be expected from patients experiencing chronic pain, it is not necessary to demand them from the inexperienced. The criteria for the description of pain quality proposed by the International Headache Society may need to be widened accordingly.
Considering some previous case series and cohort studies and our findings, moderate pain seems far more common than assumed previously. We propose classifying headaches with typical timing and clinical appearance, but not of severe intensity, as AH.

### Reframing postconcussional syndrome as an interface disorder of neurology, psychiatry and psychology [^114k3Q4V]. Brain (2022). Medium credibility.

Post-traumatic dizziness is another good example of symptom clustering. The commonest causes following mTBI are benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (40%) and vestibular migraine (34%). Vestibular migraine is associated with other migrainous symptoms as discussed above but, perhaps surprisingly, benign paroxysmal positional vertigo is also associated with cognitive impairments and heightened anxiety, especially if left untreated.

Relationship to psychiatric disorders

Mild TBI increases the risk of developing a subsequent psychiatric condition nearly threefold. However, trying to distinguish psychiatric conditions such as anxiety, depression or post-traumatic stress disorder from the effects of a mTBI can be challenging due to symptom overlap, yet has important implications for symptom persistence (Table 3). It is important to remember that symptom overlap can obscure diagnostic clarity, 50% of people with depression who have not had a TBI meet the criteria for moderate to severe PCS. Alongside the psychosocial impact of head injury, it is of course also possible for depression and anxiety to be related to structural brain injury, either as a result of macroscopic damage or triggering of a secondary inflammatory process.

Table 3
Diagnoses and important differentials for persistent symptoms post head injury from DSM-5

There also remains stigma surrounding mental health diagnoses, which results in a higher likelihood of misattributing the cognitive changes to the injury, rather than potentially reversible psychological or psychiatric causes. The unfortunate consequence of this is that appropriate, evidence-based treatment may not be accessed in a timely way, subsequently worsening the treatment responsiveness and prognosis of the psychiatric condition.

Functional neurological disorder and somatic symptom disorder

Functional neurological disorder is characterized by internal inconsistency, typically demonstrated by the complaint of abnormal function in a system that can be demonstrated (usually clinically, but sometimes by investigation) to be capable of normal function. Over 80% of people with functional neurological disorder report a health event near to the onset of functional symptoms. These events, which include accidental injuries, are typically minor and would be expected to improve and not produce lasting symptoms in their own right.

This preceding discussion clearly has relevance for the development of persistent symptoms after mTBI. The immediate and lasting physical and psychological consequences of accidents and injuries causing TBI could undoubtedly act as triggers to the onset of functional neurological disorder and/or somatic symptom disorder in some people, also interacting with pre-morbid risk factors and subsequent behaviours such as fear avoidance. Positive diagnosis of such symptoms is possible within normal clinical practice, and diagnostic explanation according to best practice is typically a positive and empowering experience for patients.

### Chronic tension-type headache in children and adolescents [^113f96NX]. Cephalalgia (2001). Low credibility.

In this study, the causes, predisposing factors and clinical features of chronic daily headache in children and adolescents were studied within the population of patients attending a specialist headache. The International Headache Society's (IHS) criteria for the diagnosis of chronic tension type headache (CTTH) were assessed for their applicability in the paediatric age group. Over a period of three years, demographic and clinical data were collected prospectively on all children who attended the clinic and suffered from daily attacks of headache. One hundred and fifteen children and adolescents (32% of all clinic population) had chronic daily headache, of whom 93 patients (81%) fulfilled the IHS criteria for the diagnosis of CTTH. They were between 3–15 years of age (mean: 11.1, SD: 2.3) and their female to male ratio was 1.2: 1. Around one third of the patients also suffered from migraine (mainly migraine without aura). The headache was described as mild in 60.9%, moderate 36.5% and severe 2.6%. Headache was located at the forehead in 53% or over the whole of the head in 29.6%. Pain was described as 'just sore' or dull by 73.9%. During attacks of headache, at least half the patients reported light intolerance, noise intolerance, anorexia or nausea. Thirty-two percent of patients had at least one underlying chronic disease that may have contributed to the pathogenesis of the CTTH. Eleven percent had serious stressful events related to family illnesses and in four patients headaches were triggered by family bereavement. Fourteen percent were investigated with neuroimaging and 22% were referred for clinical psychology assessment and management. In conclusion, CTTH is a common cause of headache in children attending a specialist headache clinic. The clinical features closely match those of adult population and the IHS criteria for the diagnosis of CTTH can be adapted for use in children. Predisposing stressful risk factors, physical or emotional, are present in a large proportion.

Diagnosis of concussion — the diagnosis is challenging and based on clinical assessment; it is complicated by a lack of validated, objective diagnostic tests, reliance on self-reported symptoms, and confounding symptoms from other conditions; nonspecific symptoms such as headaches, mood changes, "fogginess", dizziness, visual changes, fatigue, and neck pain may also originate from other etiologies; symptoms may be delayed or initially unrecognized, and concussion remains a clinical diagnosis made by synthesizing history and physical examination findings as the injury evolves.

### Female cluster headache in the United States of America: what are the gender differences? Results from the United States cluster headache survey [^113US3pZ]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To present results from the United States Cluster Headache Survey regarding gender differences in cluster headache demographics, clinical characteristics, diagnostic delay, triggers, treatment response and personal burden.

Background

Very few studies have looked at the gender differences in cluster headache presentation. The United States Cluster Headache Survey is the largest study of cluster headache sufferers ever completed in the United States and it is also the largest study of female cluster headache patients ever presented.

Methods

The total survey consisted of 187 multiple choice questions which dealt with various issues related to cluster headache including: demographics, clinical characteristics, concomitant medical conditions, family history, triggers, smoking history, diagnosis, treatment response and personal burden. A group of questions were specifically targeted to female cluster headache patients. The survey was placed on a website from October to December 2008. For all survey responders the diagnosis of cluster headache needed to be made by a neurologist but there was no validation of the headache diagnosis by the authors.

Results

1134 individuals completed the survey (816 male, 318 female). Key Points that define the differences between female and male cluster headache include: a. Age of onset: women develop cluster headache at an earlier age than men and are more likely to develop a second peak of cluster headache onset after 50 years of age. b. Family history: woman cluster headache sufferers are more likely to have a family history of both cluster headache and migraine and have an increased familial risk of Parkinson's disease. c. Comorbid conditions: female cluster headaches sufferers are significantly more likely to experience depression and have asthma than males. d. Aura issues: aura with cluster headache is equally common in both sexes, but aura duration is shorter in women. Women are much more likely to experience sensory, language and brainstem auras. e. Pain location: cluster headache pain is typically retro-orbital in location in both sexes but women are significantly more likely to experience cluster headache pain in the jaw, cheek and ear than men. f. Associated symptoms: women with cluster headache develop more "migrainous" associated symptoms than men, especially nausea and they are also more likely to have self-injurious behavior than men. g. Triggers: women with cluster headache are much less likely to have alcohol trigger a headache, but are significantly more likely to have "migrainous" triggers for their cluster headaches than men. h. Smoking issues: women are much less likely to have a smoking history than male cluster headache sufferers, more likely to have never smoked prior to cluster headache onset. i. Cycle issues: spring and fall are the most common time to start a cluster headache cycle in both sexes. Women are statistically significantly less likely to start a cluster headache cycle in the months of October–December than men. Women have more attacks per day and higher pain intensity nighttime attacks than men. j.

Treatment

in regard to acute treatment women statistically were less response to sumatriptan injectable and nasal spray than men, but statistically more likely to respond to inhaled lidocaine. There was equal efficacy in the sexes to inhaled oxygen but slower response in women. For preventive treatment no significant gender differences were noted, but overall women were less responsive to almost all preventives than men. k. Diagnostic delay: there remains a significant diagnostic delay for cluster headache patients in both sexes but women were more likely to be diagnosed after 10 years of symptom onset than males and significantly fewer women were diagnosed correctly at an initial physician visit than men. l. Female specific issues: cluster headache does not appear to be influenced by menses or menopause but 50% of the survey responders stated their headaches improved with pregnancy. Cluster headache does not appear to alter fertility rates in female cluster headache sufferers. m. Personal burden: cluster headache causes significantly more personal burden in women than men with more loss of employment and/or need of disability, as well as more homebound days.

Conclusion

Overall women and men with cluster headache have a similar presentation but there are some distinct differences that have been suggested in smaller studies of female cluster headache that we have now verified, while some of our study conclusions have not been shown previously. One major limitation to the study is a lack of validation of diagnosis. A substantial false positive cluster headache diagnosis rate, especially in females, cannot be excluded by the study methods utilized.

### Tension-type headache [^116gVnvK]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2021). High credibility.

Tension-type headache (TTH) is the most prevalent neurological disorder worldwide and is characterized by recurrent headaches of mild to moderate intensity, bilateral location, pressing or tightening quality, and no aggravation by routine physical activity. Diagnosis is based on headache history and the exclusion of alternative diagnoses, with clinical criteria provided by the International Classification of Headache Disorders, third edition. Although the biological underpinnings remain unresolved, it seems likely that peripheral mechanisms are responsible for the genesis of pain in TTH, whereas central sensitization may be involved in transformation from episodic to chronic TTH. Pharmacological therapy is the mainstay of clinical management and can be divided into acute and preventive treatments. Simple analgesics have evidence-based effectiveness and are widely regarded as first-line medications for the acute treatment of TTH. Preventive treatment should be considered in individuals with frequent episodic and chronic TTH, and if simple analgesics are ineffective, poorly tolerated or contraindicated. Recommended preventive treatments include amitriptyline, venlafaxine and mirtazapine, as well as some selected non-pharmacological therapies. Despite the widespread prevalence and associated disability of TTH, little progress has been made since the early 2000s owing to a lack of attention and resource allocation by scientists, funding bodies and the pharmaceutical industry.

### Headache in cerebrovascular diseases [^112efcNF]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Headache can manifest as a major symptom of craniocervical vascular disease

In many of these conditions, such as ischaemic or haemorrhagic stroke, headache is overshadowed by focal signs and/or disorders of consciousness. Headaches associated with ischaemic stroke have no special features, which can be ipsilateral or bilateral, mild to moderate intensity and often recover within 3 months. It is more common in posterior circulation than in anterior circulation. In haemorrhagic stroke, headache is usually severe and torturous. It can be maximal on the day of its onset and localised in accordance with the site of the haemorrhage. Some cerebrovascular diseases can cause headache and stroke simultaneously, such as subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH), CNS vasculitis, artery dissection, cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT), and so on, in which headache is usually a warning symptom. Therefore, it is essential to be aware of the relationship between headache and cerebral vascular diseases, so that we can timely identify causes and intervene as soon as possible to avoid serious consequences (table 2).

Table 2
Headache attributed to cerebrovascular diseases with clinical and diagnostic features

Subarachnoid haemorrhage

Aneurysm rupture is the major cause of non-traumatic SAH, accounting for 85% of all SAHs, whereas 10% of SAH cases are classified as idiopathic perimesencephalic haemorrhage. The remaining cases include intracranial arterial dissection, vascular malformation, CVT and reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome (RCVS). Thunderclap headache is the most common symptom of SAH, in which mortality is 30%–40%. It is a sudden, severe, usually stabbing pain, reaching maximal intensity in less than 1 hour and lasting for days or weeks. However, initial misdiagnosis occurs in one-quarter to one-half of patients, which is usually misdiagnosed as migraine. So great attention must be paid to the sudden onset, high intensity and the description of the extreme pain. The attack of thunderclap headache may also be associated with nausea or vomiting (77% of cases), transient loss of consciousness (53% of cases) and nuchal rigidity (35% of cases).SAH occurs during stressful events, such as physical exertion or emotional stress, in about half of the patients. However, these features are not specific to SAH. Following physical examination, analysis of the medical history, CT scan and lumbar puncture help us get final diagnosis.

### Guidelines of the international headache society for controlled trials of acute treatment of migraine attacks in adults: fourth edition [^116AKjca]. Cephalalgia (2019). Medium credibility.

1.2.9. Timing of administration

Recommendations:

1.2.9.1. The timing of acute treatment should be defined in the trial protocol.

1.2.9.2. Usually, participants are instructed to treat when migraine headache pain is of at least moderate intensity, but alternatives include treating as soon as possible after headache onset, treating when pain intensity is mild, and treating when pain intensity is severe.

1.2.9.3. The timing of acute treatment must be consistent with the objectives of the trial.

1.2.9.4. Subjects should record the time and pain intensity at the time of treatment in the trial diary.

Comments:

The head pain of migraine frequently begins with mild intensity, progressively increases with variable speed to a peak, and is followed by resolution; headache pain can also fluctuate spontaneously during a migraine attack. These characteristics can pose challenges regarding the timing of treatment (e.g. early or when the attack is fully developed) and the evaluation of trial results. For example, healthcare providers typically recommend treating early in the course of a migraine attack, while pain intensity is mild, because it can enhance efficacy. At the beginning of an attack, however, migraine without aura can be difficult to distinguish from non-migraine headaches. Thus, subjects in migraine clinical trials who are instructed to treat as soon as possible (i.e. at the first sign of migraine) may mistakenly treat other headache types. The potential for confusion is mitigated when attacks are allowed to fully develop. Having subjects wait until pain intensity is moderate or severe before treating increases the specificity of migraine diagnoses. Yet because this strategy conflicts with common clinical advice about early treatment, it is essential that participants in clinical trials receive clear instruction about when to use acute treatment. In later stages of development, depending on the specific objectives of the program, trials evaluating early intervention and treatment when headache pain intensity is severe (e.g. for early morning migraine) are encouraged when investigating the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of new treatments.

### Management of headaches in children and adolescents [^114XkXht]. Current Problems in Pediatric and Adolescent Health Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Pediatric headache impacts up to 80% of children, many recurrently, by the time they are 15 years old. Preventing the progression of episodic to chronic headache results in less truancy, staying current with schoolwork and improves children's quality of life. Lifestyle choices can play an important role in headache treatment. Early effective treatment of episodic headache can prevent transformation into a chronic form. While details of a child's headache are critical for making a proper diagnosis; patient education is critical and effective rescue and preventive treatment strategies enable patients to focus on enjoying activities of daily living. Recognizing "red flags" that may suggest a serious underlying etiology is critical in the early stages of diagnosing and preparing to treat children with headaches. Finally directing patients to manage their headaches at home and when to proceed to an emergency department, urgent care or infusion unit can lower the economic burden of acute headache management.

### Diagnosis and management of migraine in ten steps [^114u9R7g]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2021). High credibility.

Step 2: Diagnosis of migraine

The medical history is the mainstay of migraine diagnosis; with the assistance of a range of published aids (see the section Diagnostic aids), a full history should enable systematic application of the criteria set out in the ICHD-3. Physical examination is most often confirmatory and further investigations (for example, neuroimaging, blood samples or lumbar puncture) are occasionally required to confirm or reject suspicions of secondary causes for headache.

Medical history

An adequate medical history must include at least the following: age at onset of headache; duration of headache episodes; frequency of headache episodes; pain characteristics (for example, location, quality, severity, aggravating factors and relieving factors); accompanying symptoms (for example, photophobia, phonophobia, nausea and vomiting); aura symptoms (if any); and history of acute and preventive medication use. All are essential for the application of the ICHD-3 criteria.

Diagnostic criteria

The ICHD-3 criteria(Box 1), which were developed by the International Headache Society, set out the clinical features that establish the diagnosis of migraine and its types and subtypes. These criteria prioritize specificity over sensitivity, so an additional set of criteria are given for a diagnosis of probable migraine, which is defined as "migraine-like attacks missing one of the features required to fulfil all criteria for a type or subtype of migraine". Probable migraine is a diagnosis pending confirmation during early follow-up.

### Other primary headaches-thunderclap-, cough-, exertional-, and sexual headache [^114GqJfj]. Journal of Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

A primary headache is synonymous with a headache disorder having no clear correlating aetiology on examination of the patient nor on structural imaging. The terminology has evolved from 'benign' and 'idiopathic' to the current use of 'primary'. The majority of individuals experience spontaneous and recurrent episodes of self-limiting pain. The International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD) has been successful in refining phenotypes which, based upon history alone, provides well-defined clinical syndromes likely to respond to specific treatments.

Knowledge of the primary headaches comes largely from the work in the most prevalent disorders, namely tension-type headache, migraine, and cluster headache. This supports the concept that these disorders occur in those genetically predisposed and, where the inherent pathology is in the central nervous system. When individuals first experience a headache, the concern is often about a sinister precipitating pathology. However, in patients presenting with tension-type headache, or migraine with and without typical aura and a normal neurological examination, the prevalence of an underlying brain lesion is the same as that in an asymptomatic population. With more uncommon disorders, acquiring population-based data is much more challenging and the literature is confounded by publication bias.

Part I of the ICHD orders the primary headaches into four sections: migraine, tension-type headache, the trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias and a fourth groups of miscellaneous, largely paroxysmal headache disorders. Although the fourth section of the ICHD has been one into which miscellaneous disorders have been consigned the grouping does reflect syndromic and, pathophysiological alignment. Most of the syndromes are precipitated, paroxysmal and usually short-lived (Table 1). Moreover, the most consistent preventative treatment seems to be Indometacin. New daily persistent headache is the exception; whether this is indeed a distinct pathological entity remains to be determined.

This review will focus on primary thunderclap, cough, exertional, and sexual headache. Each disorder can occur in primary and secondary forms.

Postdural puncture headache (PDPH) — diagnostic features and postpartum prevalence are quantified, emphasizing differential diagnosis. In an observational study of 77 patients with PDPH, 55% exclusively reported a postural component to their headache, whereas 45% occasionally experienced a non-postural headache when rising from the recumbent to the upright position. In the obstetric population, about one-third of women develop headaches in the first postpartum week; in a prospective study, nearly 75% of headaches were primary and PDPH accounted for only 4.7% of all the postpartum headaches. Seizures have been reported with PDPH due to cerebral vasoconstriction, and appropriate clinical and neurological examination, imaging studies and regular follow-up should be performed based on the clinical presentation to ensure correct diagnosis and treatment of headache.

Secondary headache — International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD-3) diagnostic criteria are outlined as follows: Initial evaluation of headache should aim to determine whether a secondary cause exists, and emergent evaluation should be considered based on red flag features; in general, a secondary headache can be diagnosed if the headache is new and occurs in close temporal relation to another disorder known to cause headache, or when a preexisting headache disorder significantly worsens in close temporal relation to a causative disorder, in which case both the primary and secondary headache diagnoses should be given. General diagnostic criteria for secondary headaches require: A. any headache fulfilling C; B. another disorder scientifically documented to be able to cause headache has been diagnosed with evidence of causation demonstrated by at least two of the following — headache has developed in temporal relation to the onset of the presumed causative disorder; either or both of the following: headache has significantly worsened in parallel with worsening of the presumed causative disorder or headache has significantly improved in parallel with improvement of the presumed causative disorder; headache has characteristics typical for the causative disorder; or other evidence of causation exists; and C. not better accounted for by another ICHD-3 diagnosis.

Neck pain — Component 2 classification (impairment patterns and re-evaluation): Differential evaluation of musculoskeletal clinical findings is used to determine the most relevant physical impairments associated with the patient's reported activity limitations and medical diagnosis, and for neck pain are classified according to the key impairment(s) of body function, along with the characteristic and distribution of pain associated with that classification. For neck-related headaches, clinicians are encouraged to refer to the International Classification of Headache Disorders for a more inclusive list of headache types/classifications and to The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence for additional signs, symptoms, and conditions that should be considered in patients who present with a headache in addition to neck pain. Overall, classification is critical for matching the intervention strategy that is most likely to provide the optimal outcome for a patient's condition, but patients with neck pain often exhibit signs and symptoms that fit more than 1 classification, and the most relevant impairments of body function and the associated intervention strategies often change during the patient's episode of care; thus, continual re-evaluation of the patient's response to treatment and the patient's emerging clinical findings is important for providing the optimal interventions throughout the patient's episode of care.

### Tension-type headache: current research and clinical management [^113hEycj]. The Lancet: Neurology (2008). Medium credibility.

Tension-type headache (TTH) is the most common form of headache, and chronic tension-type headache (CTTH) is one of the most neglected and difficult types of headache to treat. The pathogenesis of TTH is multifactorial and varies between forms and individuals. Peripheral mechanisms (myofascial nociception) and central mechanisms (sensitisation and inadequate endogenous pain control) are intermingled: the former predominate in infrequent and frequent TTH, whereas the latter predominate in CTTH. Acute therapy is effective for episodes of TTH, whereas preventive treatment — which is indicated for frequent and chronic TTH — is, on average, not effective. For most patients with CTTH, the combination of drug therapies and non-drug therapies (such as relaxation and stress management techniques or physical therapies) is recommended. There is clearly an urgent need to improve the management of patients who are disabled by headache. This Review summarises the present knowledge on TTH and discusses some of its more problematic features.

### Prognostic factors for chronic headache: a systematic review [^115WZnnY]. Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

Summary of results.

In this review, we aimed to systematically identify predictors, moderators, and mediators of prognosis and outcomes in chronic headache from prospective studies, including prospective cohorts and trials of preventive interventions. Our findings suggest with moderate-quality evidence that depression/anxiety, medication overuse, poor sleep, high stress, and low HMSE are associated with worse outcomes. Lower-quality evidence suggests that higher expectations, age, age at onset, headache frequency, intensity, BMI, disability scores, and employment are potential predictors. The highest-quality evidence we found suggests that psychosocial factors, anxiety and mood disorder, sleep and stress, and HMSE are potential prognostic factors. This is an important finding, as these factors are all potentially modifiable. Specifically, groups with low mood (anxiety and mood disorder) appear to respond better to antidepressants and stress management therapy. In the absence of anxiety and mood disorder, higher HMSE improves treatment outcomes. We also found some evidence that more positive expectations about treatment are associated with better outcomes. Our results also suggest that older patients and those with more severe headache might benefit from multidisciplinary treatment, which can address comorbidity and specifically tailor treatment to more complex needs. However, owing to the limited number of studies, it was not possible to identify prognostic factors from studies providing high-quality evidence. The number of studies identified matching our inclusion criteria for this review was low and overall quality of evidence was moderate, low, or very low, implying that confidence in the estimate is low.

Comparison with other studies and reviews.

While most of the evidence on prognostic factors in the field focuses on studying the chronification process of headache or risk factors of developing chronic headache from episodic headache, we looked at patients with a diagnosis of chronic headache at baseline. Our findings indicate that there is potential for behavioral interventions targeting psychosocial prognostic factors in people living with chronic headache. Our results are in line with Smitherman et al.who suggest that depression, anxiety, and insomnia should be assessed in every treatment-seeking headache patient, particularly those with frequent attacks. Our finding that self-efficacy can mediate treatment effects in chronic headache is in line with Peck and Smitherman, who assessed HMSE as mediator for the relationship between headache severity and disability in a population of predominantly nonchronic headache sufferers. Self-efficacy has also been found to be associated with improvement of outcomes in other chronic pain conditions.

### Revisiting the ICHD-3 criteria for headache attributed to mild traumatic injury to the head: insights from the toronto concussion study analysis of acute headaches following concussion [^116Lm55W]. Cephalalgia (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The current ICHD-3 guidelines for acute headache attributed to a mild traumatic injury to the head are based upon expert opinion rather than evidence. The Toronto Concussion Study is one of the few studies to systematically and prospectively evaluate acute headaches attributed to head injury within the first week post-concussion in a general (non-compensable injury) population.

Out of 302 patients with diagnosed concussions by ED physicians, almost all patients (92%) examined within a week post-injury at the Hull-Ellis Concussion and Research Clinic post-concussion endorsed acute PTH. Those presenting with acute PTH at their initial clinic visit all met ICHD-3 criteria for acute headaches attributed to mild traumatic injury to the head and were carefully and thoughtfully evaluated.

The results of our study validate the current ICHD-3 criteria for acute headaches attributed to head injury. The Toronto Concussion Study provides meaningful evidence to support the ICHD-3 assertion there are no defining clinical characteristics of acute PTH (i.e. pain frequency, duration, location, quality, associated symptoms, provoking and aggravating factors are heterogeneous). The most reported headache frequency was daily and intermittent (59%) or daily and continuous (25%). Headache location was highly variable and was not correlated with the site of injury. In terms of primary headache quality, the most common quality was pressure/squeezing/tightening in 69% of patients whereas throbbing/pulsing was endorsed by 22%. Very few patients had neuropathic-type head pain (stabbing). 41% of patient had more than one headache phenotype. Commonly associated symptoms included photophobia (74%), phonophobia (72%) and nausea (55%). Trigeminal autonomic symptoms occurred in some patients but were much less common.

### Sinus headache: differential diagnosis and an evidence-based approach [^1144Vo3w]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

The diagnosis "sinus headache" has been reclassified as "headache attributed to disorder of the nose or paranasal sinuses" by the International Headache Society, but the term is still commonly used by patients and primary care doctors alike. Rhinologic symptoms and headache disorders are common, and they may coexist without a causative relationship. Patients may undergo unnecessary medical interventions because of inadequate understanding of the classifications and management of various headache disorders. Otolaryngologists frequently treat patients with these complaints, and a systematic approach to the differential diagnosis and utilization of a multidisciplinary approach are critical in providing optimal patient care.

### Paroxysmal pressing headache: a new short-lasting headache [^117PfpW2]. Cephalalgia (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In this report we describe a series of patients with a previously undescribed headache.

Methods

Over a 4-year period, we recruited 14 patients with a distinctive type of head pain of unknown cause that did not meet diagnostic criteria for other primary headaches.

Results

Nine women and five men with a mean age of 49.6 years (standard deviation, 17.8) presented with spontaneous headache attacks lasting 2–15 minutes. In each attack, the pain was localized to a region of one side of the head. Pain location varied between episodes in 12 patients. Pain quality was pressing, and pain intensity was mild to severe. There were no accompanying symptoms. Physical examination and all ancillary tests were unremarkable. Among seven patients who tried pharmacological treatments, one responded to antidepressants, another to indomethacin and three to other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or simple analgesics.

Conclusions

Paroxysmal pressing headache may be a new headache syndrome marked by short duration of the pain and shifting location.

### High risk clinical characteristics for subarachnoid haemorrhage in patients with acute headache: prospective cohort study [^116NggGU]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

In a five year multicentre study we derived three decision rules using clinical findings to identify which neurologically intact patients with headache require investigation to rule out arguably the most serious cause of headache, subarachnoid haemorrhage. Arrival by ambulance, age ≥ 40, complaint of neck stiffness or pain, onset with exertion, vomiting, witnessed loss of consciousness, and raised blood pressure were strongly and reliably associated with subarachnoid haemorrhage. The presence of one or more of these findings in a patient with an acute non-traumatic headache reaching maximum intensity within one hour and that is unlike previous headaches should prompt physicians to consider investigating for subarachnoid haemorrhage.

We have previously shown that while physicians can discriminate between patients with subarachnoid haemorrhage and other forms of headache, they are reluctant to do so solely on their clinical findings. Our clinical decision rules, if validated, should provide physicians with evidence to manage more headache patients safely without investigation. Beyond healthcare costs, investigations entail exposure to radiation and perhaps intravenous contrast medium, difficulties in interpreting erythrocyte counts in traumatic lumbar punctures with false positive results, the indirect costs of incidental findings, and the morbidity of a headache after dural puncture. More selective testing can also shorten length of stay in an overcrowded emergency department. We have previously shown that computed tomography of the head adds about three hours to a patient's length of stay, and performing a lumbar puncture adds another four hours.

We are not aware of previous studies on clinical decision rules in patients with headache and normal results on neurological examinations. One small prospective study in 137 headache patients, including 23 cases of subarachnoid haemorrhage, concluded, without conducting a multivariate analysis, that there was no single clinical feature that could reliably identify which patients with headache require investigation. Other previous studies have attempted to identify risk factors and features suggestive of subarachnoid haemorrhage. A retrospective study of 500 patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage found that risk factors included women aged over 50, men aged under 50, and stressful events. Other proposed risk factors include alcohol consumption, smoking, hypertension, and oral contraceptives, but these variables are prevalent among many patients in emergency departments and might not be clinically useful for differentiating subarachnoid haemorrhage from other headaches. Uncommon connective tissue disorders, including Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type IV, autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, and Marfan's syndrome, can lead to subarachnoid haemorrhage but are absent in most patients with subarachnoid haemorrhage. Neck stiffness is often cited in reviews of the topic. Other associations with subarachnoid haemorrhage include acutely raised blood pressure.

Infrequent episodic tension-type headache — diagnostic criteria require at least 10 episodes of headache occurring on < 1-day/month on average (< 12-days/year) and fulfilling criteria B-D, with attacks lasting from 30-minutes to 7-days. At least two of the following must be present: bilateral location; pressing or tightening (non-pulsating) quality; mild or moderate intensity; not aggravated by routine physical activity such as walking or climbing stairs. Both of the following are also required: no nausea or vomiting; no more than one of photophobia or phonophobia, and the headache is not better accounted for by another ICHD-3 diagnosis. When headache fulfils criteria for both 1.5 Probable migraine and 2.1 Infrequent episodic tension-type headache, code as 2.1 Infrequent episodic tension-type headache under the general rule that definite diagnoses always trump probable diagnoses.

Recommendations follow the evidence-based treatments so far as is possible with expert opinion to give clinical guidance. Headache has 2 levels of care: acute treatments designed to stop a headache from progressing and alleviate all symptoms associated with the headache and preventive therapies for patients whose headache frequency is such that by itself produces significant disability and impact on quality of life, or where the frequency of use of acute medications, regardless of efficacy, poses risks in terms of overuse or adverse events.

### Diagnosis and management of childhood headache [^113dYgUF]. Current Problems in Pediatric and Adolescent Health Care (2016). Low credibility.

Headache is one of the most common chief complaints seen in the pediatrician's office. Oftentimes, identifying the etiology of headache and differentiating primary and secondary causes can present a diagnostic conundrum. Understanding the most common causes of primary and secondary headache is vital to making a correct diagnosis. Here we review the typical presentations of the most common primary headache disorders and the approach to evaluation of the pediatric patient presenting with headache. Diagnostic workup, including the key features to elicit on physical examination, when to order head imaging, and the use of other ancillary tests, is discussed. Current treatment modalities and their indications are reviewed. We will also describe some of the new, emerging therapies that may alter the way we manage headache in the pediatric population. Headache can, at times, be a frustrating symptom seen in the pediatrician's office, but here we hope to better elucidate the approach to evaluation, management, and treatment as well as provide some hope in regards to more effective upcoming therapies.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® headache: 2022 update [^1133kuEW]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Headache is an ancient problem plaguing a large proportion of the population. At present, headache disorders rank third among the global causes of disability, accounting for over $78 billion per year in direct and indirect costs in the United States. Given the prevalence of headache and the wide range of possible etiologies, the goal of this document is to help clarify the most appropriate initial imaging guidelines for headache for eight clinical scenarios/variants, which range from acute onset, life-threatening etiologies to chronic benign scenarios. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where peer reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

Chronic migraine — diagnostic notes state that characterization of frequently recurring headache generally requires a headache diary to record information on pain and associated symptoms day-by-day for at least one month; when criteria A-C are fulfilled by headache that is daily and unremitting from < 24 hours after its first onset, code as 4.10 New daily persistent headache, and when the manner of onset is not remembered or is otherwise uncertain, code as 1.3 Chronic migraine; the most common cause of symptoms suggestive of chronic migraine is medication overuse, and patients meeting criteria for 1.3 Chronic migraine and for 8.2 Medication-overuse headache should be coded for both, with around 50% of patients apparently with 1.3 Chronic migraine reverting to an episodic migraine type after drug withdrawal; because tension-type-like headache is within the diagnostic criteria for 1.3 Chronic migraine, the diagnosis excludes the diagnosis of 2. Tension-type headache or its types.

### Headache management for the pain specialist [^115KZVvt]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Headache is a common symptom caused by a wide variety of diseases. Primary headaches include migraine, cluster headache, tension-type headache, and other less common diseases. It is important to differentiate these headaches from secondary headaches caused by vascular, neoplastic, infectious, metabolic, or toxic disorders. Most primary headaches have a genetic basis, with environmental factors acting as triggers. Recent advances in basic research resulted in the development of more specific and effective therapies. Medication-overuse headache is a very common cause of chronic daily headache. Detoxification from the offending drug is essential for headache improvement. Cervicogenic headache is common and needs to be diagnosed correctly since it may require specific therapy. Nerve blocks are useful for some patients with primary, as well as secondary, headaches.

Chronic classification across primary headaches is defined differently: for migraine and tension-type headache (TTH), chronic refers to frequent headaches occurring on 15 or more days per month for more than 3 months; for cluster headache, chronic refers to headaches occurring for 1 year or longer without remission or with remission periods lasting fewer than 3 months; because primary headaches are recurrent, a single or first-time headache should prompt appropriate evaluation for secondary causes, and these criteria apply only if the diagnosis is not better accounted for by another ICHD-3 diagnosis.

### Pediatric posttraumatic headache: a review [^112UuaMm]. Journal of Child Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Head injuries are common in pediatrics, and headaches are the most common complaint following mild head trauma. Although moderate and severe traumatic brain injuries occur less frequently, headaches can complicate recovery. There is currently an intense spotlight on concussion and there has been a corresponding increase in the number of children seeking care for headache after mild traumatic brain injury or concussion. Understanding the natural history of, and recognition of factors that are associated with posttraumatic headache will help providers and families to limit disability and may prompt earlier intervention to address disabling headaches. While there are few studies on the treatment of posttraumatic headache, proper evaluation and management of posttraumatic headaches is essential to prevent further injury and to promote recovery. In this article, we will review the current definitions and epidemiology of pediatric posttraumatic headache and discuss current recommendations for the evaluation and management of this syndrome in children and adolescents.

### Headache treatment options [^114gVp3d]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Family medicine physicians often see headache as the chief complaint when meeting patients within their practice. The goal is to try different treatment modalities without having to send the patient to a specialist. Headaches affect different individuals during their lifetime. Before any treatment begins, it is best that one rules out possible causes of the headache, for example, drug interactions or structural cerebrum conditions. Nonpharmacological treatment is recommended first before attempting a stepwise approach to cost-effective pharmacological treatment options. Pharmacological treatment options should include preventive and on-demand options. A family physician has all the resources to assist patients with different types of headaches.

### Tension-type headache… [^114exB12]. AAFP (2002). Low credibility.

Evaluation of the Headache Patient HISTORY Tension-type headaches can last from 30 minutes to several days and can be continuous in severe cases. The pain is mild or moderately intense and is described as tightness, pressure, or a dull ache. The pain is usually experienced as a band extending bilaterally back from the forehead across the sides of the head to the occiput. 10 Patients often report that this tension radiates from the occiput to the posterior neck muscles. In its most extensive form, the pain distribution is "cape like, " radiating along the medial and lateral trapezius muscles covering the shoulders, scapular, and interscapular areas. 10 In addition to its characteristic distribution and intermittent nature, the history obtained from patients with tension-type headache discloses an absence of signs of any serious underlying condition.

11 Patients who have chronic daily headache present with the typical pain characteristics of tension-type headache but have symptoms that occur daily or almost daily. A careful history will generally reveal that the daily tension-type headache was preceded by intermittent migraine-type headaches rather than intermittent tension-type headaches. 12 Patients should be screened for psychiatric comorbidity, because anxiety, depression, and psychosocial stress can be prevalent in patients with tension-type headaches.
13. In patients with chronic tension-type headache, the treatment goals are to initiate effective prophylactic treatment and to manage any residual headaches in a manner that prevents the frequent use of analgesics and the risk for progression to chronic daily headache syndrome. Patients with chronic tension-type headache should limit their use of analgesics to two times weekly to prevent the development of chronic daily headache.

If the patient requires analgesic medication more frequently, adjunctive headache medications can be initiated. After stopping daily analgesic use, patients often revert to the headache pattern that preceded the chronic daily headache. If this does occur, prophylactic treatment should continue, and migraine-specific treatment should be given for the acute headache.
30. Numerous small studies have investigated cognitive psychotherapy alone and in combination with other behavioral treatment for chronic tension-type headache. Among these trials, at least 50 percent of patients had reduced symptoms when treated with progressive relaxation, cognitive therapy, or a combination of the two.

33 This study 33 compared patients who self-administered treatments at home with patients receiving therapy in the office and noted a trend toward greater symptom reduction in patients receiving in-office treatment; however, this difference was not statistically significant.
