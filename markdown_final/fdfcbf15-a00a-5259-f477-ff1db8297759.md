## Question

A 52-year-old man is diagnosed with a sacral chordoma after presenting with lower back pain and neurological symptoms. The diagnosis is confirmed by biopsy at a local hospital. The hospital is a general facility with orthopedic and neurosurgical services but does not have a dedicated sarcoma multidisciplinary team or access to specialized sarcoma care pathways. The patient's primary care physician asks you, as a consultant, whether it is appropriate to proceed with definitive management (surgery and/or radiotherapy) at the local hospital, or if referral elsewhere should be considered.

Based on current ESMO guidelines, what is the most appropriate setting for the management of this patient with chordoma, and why?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a 52-year-old man with a sacral chordoma should receive definitive management at a local general hospital without a sarcoma multidisciplinary team, or whether referral to a specialized center is indicated based on current ESMO guidance. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the disease-specific implications of sacral chordoma and why outcomes hinge on surgical margins and radiation dose. Then, I should verify what ESMO and related guidelines say about the setting of care and the requirement for multidisciplinary teams. Next, I will examine the surgical and radiotherapy technical requirements that are unlikely to be available locally. After that, I should review evidence linking center experience and technique to outcomes. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, guideline-concordant recommendation and address potential counterarguments about delays or access barriers.

> Let me first confirm the clinical stakes. Sacral chordoma is a rare, locally aggressive malignancy with a high propensity for local recurrence; long-term control depends heavily on en bloc resection with negative margins and, when indicated, high-dose, conformal radiotherapy, ideally with particle therapy, because chordomas are relatively radioresistant and require doses around or above 74 Gy, which exceeds what conventional photon techniques can safely deliver in many anatomically constrained sites [^ebc09755] [^c387e73f] [^0fab1c0e].

> Wait, let me verify the guideline position on setting of care. The ESMO-EURACAN-GENTURIS-ERN paedCan guideline explicitly recommends that patients with bone sarcomas, including chordoma, be managed at reference centers or within reference networks that provide access to the full spectrum of care and age-specific expertise; this is a direct recommendation for centralized, multidisciplinary management rather than local, non-specialized care [^62c13961]. I should also confirm that NCCN aligns with this principle; indeed, NCCN states that all patients with chordoma should be evaluated and managed by a multidisciplinary team with chordoma expertise, reinforcing the need for specialized centers and teams rather than isolated local management [^8bf64422] [^375fbc74].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to check whether the local hospital can realistically deliver the required surgical and radiotherapeutic standards. En bloc sacral resection with adequate margins is technically demanding, carries substantial morbidity risk, and requires specialized spinal surgical expertise, neurosurgical collaboration, and often plastic surgery for wound closure; contemporary series emphasize multidisciplinary planning and advanced reconstruction to mitigate complications, which are not typically available in general hospitals without sarcoma programs [^8ef6fe22] [^a8f74515]. For radiotherapy, high-dose conformal plans and particle therapy (proton or carbon ion) are preferred to achieve tumoricidal doses while respecting organs at risk; carbon ion therapy has shown comparable or superior local control with different toxicity profiles compared with surgery in sacral chordoma cohorts, and access to such modalities is concentrated in reference centers [^c387e73f] [^337fd7cf] [^e6f7a47b].

> I should double-check the evidence that center experience and technique influence outcomes. Multiple series and meta-analyses associate negative margins and adjuvant high-dose RT with improved local control and survival; for example, surgery plus adjuvant RT has been linked to lower mortality and higher progression-free survival than surgery alone in sacrococcygeal chordoma, and particle therapy cohorts demonstrate high local control rates, underscoring that both surgical quality and RT modality matter for outcomes [^e5980075] [^5b55d335] [^e6f7a47b]. Conversely, intralesional or marginal excisions are associated with very high recurrence rates, reinforcing the need for specialized surgical expertise and planning that general hospitals typically lack [^4a29d3a8].

> Let me consider the counterargument about delays from referral. While transfer can add time, the risk of noncurative local therapy at a non-specialized center is high, and recurrence after inadequate initial treatment is common and difficult to salvage; thus, the balance of benefit favors referral to a center with en bloc resection capability and access to high-dose conformal or particle RT, where definitive therapy can proceed without compromising oncologic principles [^0da95b45] [^ebc09755]. I should confirm that guidelines also emphasize early involvement of sarcoma teams even in the diagnostic phase; yes, both ESMO and NCCN stress biopsy and initial management within sarcoma pathways to preserve future resection options and coordinate multimodality care from the outset [^7d89e59e] [^e9ae8044].

> Next, I should review what the practical recommendation should be. Based on ESMO guidance and corroborating NCCN statements, the patient should be urgently referred to a reference center or sarcoma network with documented expertise in chordoma, where a multidisciplinary team including orthopedic/spine oncology, neurosurgery, radiation oncology with particle capability, sarcoma pathology, radiology, and plastic surgery can plan en bloc resection and determine the timing and modality of RT, including consideration of particle therapy or carefully selected photon techniques when particle therapy is unavailable [^62c13961] [^375fbc74] [^c387e73f]. If the tumor is deemed unresectable or surgery is declined, definitive high-dose RT (often ≥ 74 Gy) using specialized techniques should be delivered in a center with experience in chordoma RT planning and dose escalation, which again points away from local general-hospital management [^c387e73f] [^78a09317].

> In summary, I need to ensure the conclusion is precise and reference-aligned. Definitive management at the local general hospital is not appropriate for this patient because sacral chordoma requires en bloc resection with negative margins and, frequently, high-dose conformal or particle radiotherapy delivered within a multidisciplinary sarcoma framework; ESMO explicitly recommends management at reference centers with the full spectrum of care, and NCCN similarly mandates evaluation and treatment by a chordoma-experienced multidisciplinary team, so urgent referral to a specialized sarcoma center is indicated to optimize oncologic outcomes and minimize morbidity [^62c13961] [^8bf64422] [^ebc09755].

---

Per ESMO guidance, **referral to a specialized sarcoma center** is essential for sacral chordoma because management requires a multidisciplinary team with expertise in en bloc resection, high-dose radiotherapy (ideally proton/carbon ion), and long-term surveillance [^62c13961] [^ebc09755] [^c387e73f]. Local hospitals without sarcoma pathways lack the surgical expertise, advanced radiotherapy, and coordinated care needed to achieve negative margins and durable local control, which are critical for outcomes [^ebc09755] [^8ef6fe22] [^e6f7a47b]. Delaying referral risks suboptimal resection, higher recurrence, and worse survival; therefore, **urgent transfer to a reference center is recommended**.

---

## ESMO recommendations on management setting

ESMO's 2021 bone sarcoma guideline explicitly recommends that patients with bone sarcomas, including chordoma, be managed at **reference centers or within reference networks** that provide access to the full spectrum of care and age-specific expertise [^62c13961]. This ensures access to:

- **Multidisciplinary teams**: orthopedic oncologists, neurosurgeons, radiation oncologists, medical oncologists, pathologists, radiologists, and allied health professionals [^375fbc74].

- **Specialized surgical expertise**: en bloc resection with negative margins, which is the cornerstone of local control for sacral chordoma [^ebc09755] [^4a29d3a8].

- **Advanced radiotherapy**: high-dose radiotherapy (≥ 74 Gy), ideally with proton or carbon ion therapy, to improve local control and survival [^c387e73f] [^e6f7a47b].

- **Long-term surveillance**: structured follow-up to detect recurrence early and manage late effects [^3ae04e68] [^731c6189].

---

## Limitations of local hospital management

Local hospitals without dedicated sarcoma pathways typically lack the following capabilities essential for optimal chordoma care:

| **Aspect of care** | **Limitations at local hospitals** | **Specialized centers** |
|-|-|-|
| Surgical expertise | - General orthopedic or neurosurgical teams may not have experience with en bloc resection <br/> - Higher risk of positive margins and intralesional excision <br/> - Higher recurrence rates [^ebc09755] [^4a29d3a8] | - Experienced surgical teams skilled in en bloc resection <br/> - Lower recurrence rates <br/> - Better functional outcomes [^ebc09755] [^4a29d3a8] |
| Radiotherapy | - Limited access to high-dose radiotherapy <br/> - Lack of proton or carbon ion therapy <br/> - Inferior local control with conventional photon therapy [^c387e73f] [^e6f7a47b] | - Access to proton and carbon ion therapy <br/> - Superior local control and survival [^c387e73f] [^e6f7a47b] |
| Multidisciplinary coordination | - Fragmented care <br/> - Lack of coordinated decision-making <br/> - Delayed or inconsistent treatment planning [^notfound] | - Integrated MDT care <br/> - Coordinated decision-making <br/> - Timely, consistent treatment planning [^375fbc74] |
| Long-term surveillance | - Inconsistent follow-up <br/> - Limited expertise in detecting recurrence <br/> - Delayed diagnosis of recurrence [^notfound] | - Structured surveillance protocols <br/> - Early detection of recurrence <br/> - Improved outcomes [^3ae04e68] [^731c6189] |

---

## Evidence supporting referral to specialized centers

Several studies and guidelines underscore the **importance of specialized centers** for chordoma care:

- **Improved outcomes**: En bloc resection with negative margins significantly improves local control and survival compared to intralesional excision or positive margins [^4a29d3a8] [^5b55d335].

- **Advanced radiotherapy**: Proton and carbon ion therapy achieve superior local control and survival compared to conventional photon therapy, particularly in sacral chordomas [^c387e73f] [^e6f7a47b].

- **Multidisciplinary care**: Coordinated MDT management reduces recurrence and improves quality of life through comprehensive perioperative and rehabilitative care [^375fbc74] [^8ef6fe22].

---

## Risks of delaying referral

Delaying referral to a specialized center can have **significant consequences**:

- **Suboptimal surgical resection**: Increased risk of positive margins, intralesional excision, and higher recurrence rates [^ebc09755] [^4a29d3a8].

- **Reduced access to advanced radiotherapy**: Delayed or inadequate radiotherapy compromises local control and survival [^c387e73f] [^e6f7a47b].

- **Worse functional outcomes**: Inadequate surgical planning and reconstruction increase morbidity and diminish quality of life [^8ef6fe22].

- **Lower survival**: Higher recurrence and inadequate local control negatively impact overall survival [^5b55d335].

---

## Practical considerations for referral

When referring the patient, consider the following:

- **Urgency**: Refer urgently to minimize delays in definitive treatment, as chordomas are locally aggressive and recurrence risk increases with time [^notfound].

- **Documentation**: Provide comprehensive medical records, imaging, and biopsy results to facilitate rapid evaluation and treatment planning at the specialized center [^a8630f41].

- **Patient counseling**: Explain the rationale for referral, emphasizing improved outcomes, access to advanced therapies, and the risks of delayed specialized care [^e5980075].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

Per ESMO guidance, **referral to a specialized sarcoma center** is essential for a 52-year-old man with sacral chordoma. Local hospitals without sarcoma pathways lack the surgical expertise, advanced radiotherapy, and coordinated multidisciplinary care required to achieve negative margins, durable local control, and optimal survival. Delaying referral risks suboptimal treatment, higher recurrence, and worse outcomes. Therefore, **urgent transfer to a reference center** is strongly recommended.

Chordomas are rare, malignant bone tumors of the skull-base and axial skeleton. Until recently, there was no consensus among experts regarding appropriate clinical management of chordoma, resulting in inconsistent care and suboptimal outcomes for many patients. To address this shortcoming, the European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO) and the Chordoma Foundation, the global chordoma patient advocacy group, convened a multi-disciplinary group of chordoma specialists to define by consensus evidence-based best practices for the optimal approach to chordoma. In January 2015, the first recommendations of this group were published, covering the management of primary and metastatic chordomas. Additional evidence and further discussion were needed to develop recommendations about the management of local-regional failures. Thus, ESMO and CF convened a second consensus group meeting in November 2015 to address the treatment of locally relapsed chordoma. This meeting involved over 60 specialists from Europe, the United States and Japan with expertise in treatment of patients with chordoma. The consensus achieved during that meeting is the subject of the present publication and complements the recommendations of the first position paper.

### Building a global consensus approach to chordoma: a position paper from the medical and patient community [^0862e574]. The Lancet: Oncology (2015). Medium credibility.

Chordomas are very rare bone malignant tumours that have had a shortage of effective treatments for a long time. New treatments are now available for both the local and the metastatic phase of the disease, but the degree of uncertainty in selecting the most appropriate treatment remains high and their adoption remains inconsistent across the world, resulting in suboptimum outcomes for many patients. In December, 2013, the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) convened a consensus meeting to update its clinical practice guidelines on sarcomas. ESMO also hosted a parallel consensus meeting on chordoma that included more than 40 chordoma experts from several disciplines and from both sides of the Atlantic, with the contribution and sponsorship of the Chordoma Foundation, a global patient advocacy group. The consensus reached at that meeting is shown in this position paper.

The goal of ' salvage re-resection with curative intent' should be to achieve gross total resection, and, when feasible, en-bloc resection with negative surgical margins (IV-B). The best candidates for a complete re-resection are patients with isolated disease, a long disease-free interval, good PS (i.e. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group-ECOG PS ≤ 2) and with a reasonable likelihood of acceptable morbidity. In cases of multifocal disease, a cure is virtually impossible so re-resection with curative intent should not be performed (IV-B); in these cases, only a limited resection should be considered with the goal of preventing the ill effects associated with disease progression whilst preserving function. A prior history of piecemeal resection (except for skull-base tumors where resection may be necessarily piecemeal), prior high-dose RT (in case of mobile spine and sacral chordoma), and/or tumor rupture are obvious exclusion criteria for re-resection with curative intent (IV-B). There is no consensus on how to treat intracanalar disease. In patients who have not previously received high-dose RT at the time of primary treatment, pre- and/or post-operative treatment with RT may also be appropriate. This approach is currently the standard treatment strategy in primary disease at some referral centers and may be particularly well suited for treating local recurrences as the chance of achieving a true R0 resection after prior surgical procedures is low. It is currently not possible to make any recommendations regarding the role of adjuvant re-irradiation after macroscopically complete resection of recurrent chordoma.

Chordoma

Assessment in a specialist centre with expertise in managing chordomas is essential. En bloc resection with a margin of 1 mm or more is the recommended treatment where technically feasible and the sequelae of surgery are accepted by the patient. In the sacrum, surgery is the recommended treatment for tumours involving the S4 nerve root or below. Above this, surgical morbidity increases and therefore should be discussed in the context of other treatments, including radiotherapy. Sacrectomy procedures are technically demanding with a high risk of complications and require access to the appropriate surgical expertise, including sarcoma, spinal and plastic surgeons as appropriate.

Tumours of the skull base or cervical spine should be removed as completely as possible, whilst preserving neurological function and therefore quality of life. R0 resection is rarely possible. Eight studies (summarised by Stacchiotti et al.) showed surgery (R1 and R2 resections) followed by radiotherapy in selected patients produced 5-year estimated overall survival of 55–86% for chordoma of the skull base and/or cervical spine.

High-dose adjuvant radiotherapy is beneficial after surgery with positive or close surgical margins. Proton beam therapy or carbon ion radiotherapy are promising alternatives, particularly for high sacral tumours where surgical morbidity is high.

Metastases are rare but local recurrence is common and difficult to cure. Treatment for local recurrence may include surgery and/or radiation therapy and/or systemic treatment. Local treatment such as surgery, radiofrequency ablation, cryotherapy or stereotactic radiotherapy should be considered for oligometastatic disease in selected cases.

There is no standard of care systemic therapy for patients with advanced/ metastatic disease. Imatinib is commonly used, but evidence is limited, and it is not currently commissioned for use within the NHS so is not uniformly available. EGFR inhibitors have shown potential benefit in small retrospective series and may be available through compassionate-access schemes, but additional evidence is required for to be accepted as standard of care. The results of the first prospective international trial evaluating afatinib in chordoma in this setting are eagerly awaited. Immune-checkpoint inhibitors too show promise in retrospective single centre series. Prospective studies are warranted to further evaluate efficacy. Patients should be recruited to clinical trials wherever possible.

Palliative, supportive and end-of-life care

PC is part of the active care of patients with advanced illness. A comprehensive PC approach and access to specialized PC are both necessary (Table 5).

Table 5
General schema for palliative care application to advanced chordoma patients

Most chordoma patients suffer from both somatic and neuropathic pain that can be difficult to treat. Worsening of pain and/or of neurologic symptoms can be the first sign of disease relapse/progression even when this cannot be yet detected radiologically.

First-line analgesic therapy should be provided by the oncology team according to available guidelines. Pain due to the compression of nervous tissues via epidural compression or radiculopathy often benefits from steroids (dexamethasone or methylprednisolone). Difficult pain syndromes poorly responsive to analgesic pharmacotherapy can benefit from more invasive analgesic techniques such as spinal administration of opioids, ziconotide and adjuvant drugs.

In the terminal phase, the patient's preferred setting of care should be identified. Hospice and home-care are valid options depending on the patient's and family's preferences.

Follow-up

Currently, there is insufficient data to recommend an optimal routine follow-up policy for patients with recurrent chordoma. Thus, follow-up is usually chosen based on the best judgment of the patient's care team. However, experts agreed that MRI should be performed every 3–6 months at least for the first 3 years from treatment of LR/local progression. There is currently no consensus about whether routine scanning of the rest of the body is beneficial and for how long follow-up should be continued, though long-term vigilance is warranted as relapses often take place after several years.

Methods, level of evidence and grade of recommendation

To generate the recommendations summarized herein, a consensus group meeting was organized in Milan in November 2015 by ESMO and the Chordoma Foundation (CF). Representatives from the all the disciplines involved in care and treatment of patients with chordoma participated, including specialists in pathology, radiology, neurosurgery, ENT surgery, orthopedic surgery, general surgery, radiotherapy (RT), medical oncology, and palliative care (PC). A representative from main European, United States and Japanese RT centers with protons/carbon ions facilities and with experience in chordoma joined the meeting. Additional participants included patient representatives, statisticians, and molecular biologists. Prior to the meeting a literature search was conducted (details in the supplementary Appendix 1, available at Annals of Oncology online) to elucidate data upon which to base consensus recommendations. During the meeting, representatives from 14 of the participating institutions presented unpublished clinical data on patients treated with surgery and/or RT for recurrent chordoma from 2005. Based on these data and the literature review, the group reached consensus about key aspects of the management of patients with loco-regional recurrence, reported in this position paper. The present article is aimed at complementing the recommendations of the first position paper, published in 2015. To avoid repetition, this text contains several cross references to it.

We chose to grade level of evidence (LOE) from I to V and use grades of recommendation from A to D adapted from the system used by the Infectious Diseases Society of America-US Public Health Service Grading System 2 (Table 4). When published evidence was scarce but a strong consensus was present, we recorded the LOE as V. Points for which consensus among participating experts was not achieved are acknowledged an noted herein. While stronger evidence would be desirable in many areas, we recognize the inherent difficulty of generating such data for rare cancers like chordoma, and, thus, accept that a higher degree of uncertainty must be tolerated for purposes of guideline development to avoid depriving rare cancer patients and those who care for them of much needed guidance.

Table 1
Outcome of patients with recurrent skull-base and cervical spine chordoma and treated with surgical re-resection

Table 2
Outcome of primary and locally recurrent mobile spine and sacrum chordoma patients treated with surgery plus or minus RT

Table 3
Local control of primary and locally recurrent chordoma patients of all sites treated with surgery plus RT or definitive RT

Major determinants of local control in primary chordomas at all sites include tumor size, extent of resection, quality of surgery, quality of RT (e.g. dose, volume, timing and dose inhomogeneity) and patient age. The experience of the treatment center may also play a role in the likelihood of recurrence.

Patients whose tumors recur/progress locally are challenging to control in the long-term and only a minority can be cured. Hence, every effort is needed to maximize the chances for long-term control of tumor with optimal management of the patient at the time of initial treatment. Nevertheless, with optimal treatment, long-term disease control and good quality of life (QOL) may still be possible for some patients. Thus, defining evidence-based best practice to manage this disease state is of utmost importance in order to improve patient outcomes.

### Management of locally recurrent chordoma of the mobile spine and sacrum: a systematic review [^a83db485]. Spine (2016). Low credibility.

Study Design

Systematic review.

Objective

To determine evidence-based guidelines for the management of locally recurrent spinal chordoma.

Summary Of Background Data

Chordoma of the spine is a low-grade malignant tumor with a strong propensity for local recurrence. Salvage therapy is challenging due to its relentless nature and refractoriness to adjuvant therapies. There are currently no guidelines regarding the best management of recurrent chordoma.

Methods

We combined the results of a systematic review with expert opinion to address the following research questions: (1) For locally recurrent chordoma of the spine without systemic disease, if surgery is planned, should en bloc resection be attempted if technically feasible with acceptable morbidity? (2) For locally recurrent chordoma without systemic disease, in which wide en bloc excision is not possible, what is the treatment of choice? (2) Should adjuvant or neoadjuvant radiation therapy be used in the treatment of locally recurrent chordoma?

Results

A total of nine surgical and seven radiation therapy articles met study criteria. Evidence quality was low or very low. Recurrent disease is associated with predominantly poor outcome, regardless of treatment modality. As for primary chordoma, resection with wide margins appears to confer an advantage with respect to local control, although this effect is attenuated in the setting of relapse. Postoperative radiation therapy likely reduces the rate of further relapse.

Conclusion

(1) For locally recurrent chordoma of the spine without systemic disease, when surgery is planned, wide en bloc resection should be performed if technically feasible with acceptable morbidity. Strong recommendation, Low Quality of Evidence. (2) For locally recurrent chordoma without systemic disease, in which wide en bloc excision is not possible, partial resection is the treatment of choice. Weak recommendation, Very Low Quality of Evidence. (3) For the treatment of locally recurrent chordoma, high-dose conformal radiation therapy should be administered postoperatively to reduce the risk of further recurrence, and may be considered as a primary therapy. Strong recommendation, Very Low Quality of Evidence.

### Current management of sacral chordoma [^83f04535]. Neurosurgical Focus (2003). Low credibility.

Sacral chordomas are relatively rare, locally invasive, malignant neoplasms. Although metastasis is infrequent at presentation, the prognosis for patients with chordoma of the sacrum is reported to be poor and attributable in most cases to intralesional resection. The value of adjuvant treatment is uncertain, and resection remains the primary mode of treatment. Chordomas are difficult to excise completely, but recent improvements in imaging and surgical techniques have allowed surgeons to perform more frequently en bloc sacral resections with wide surgical margins. The technical challenges of such operations, and the functional costs for the patient (with respect to anorectal and urogenital dysfunction) are significantly increased when the tumor involves high sacral levels. The authors review the clinical presentation and natural history of sacral chordoma and discuss the current treatment techniques and outcomes.

Emerging approaches and future directions

For those patients who fail surgery and RT, there remains an urgent unmet need for new therapeutic options. To facilitate patient participation in clinical trials, the CF maintains an up to date list of trials open to chordoma patients and a 'target dashboard' summarizing published data about therapeutically-relevant targets.

Future clinical trials should be designed considering the rarity and distinctive natural history of chordoma. Due to its rarity, performing randomized trials may not be feasible. Additionally, due to its characteristically slow growth-rate and relatively long expected OS period, determining an OS benefit is likely impractical, thus necessitating the use of surrogate endpoints to assess efficacy. However, because patients often experience prolonged periods of symptomatic disease progression prior to end-stage disease, conventional surrogate endpoints based solely on dimensional response may miss improvements in QOL, and, thus, may be inadequate for inferring clinical benefit. New, and possibly unconventional, approaches are needed for assessing efficacy and facilitate the pathway to drug approval. Meanwhile, patients should be enrolled in prospective registries or observational studies to better understand the natural history of chordoma and identify relevant correlates of outcome that could aid in future trial design and help optimize clinical care.

Introduction

Chordomas are rare, malignant bone tumors of the skull-base and axial skeleton. Loco-regional recurrence is a common event following initial treatment of chordoma patients, and represents a major clinical challenge, which these recommendations seek to address. Loco-regional recurrence is defined as tumor relapse or progression after surgery and/or RT of the primary tumor at the same site and/or contiguous spreading of tumor from the primary site to adjacent areas. This includes progression of treated primary lesions, lesions recurring usually at, or near surgical margins, lesions that develop as a result of iatrogenic seeding along a biopsy or surgical tract, as well as skip metastases in the immediate vicinity of the tumor. In most cases, spread of the tumor is mediated by direct physical contact rather than dissemination via lymphatic, circulatory or subarachnoid routes. As such, cases with lymph node involvement are considered to have metastatic disease and are thus not addressed in these recommendations.

Published case series reporting post-surgical outcomes for chordoma indicate that loco-regional recurrence affects > 50% of patients treated with macroscopic complete resection with or without RT (Tables 1–3). Notably, a high proportion of recurrences occur late (after 5 and 10 years), requiring long-term follow-up. Limited data are available about long-term recurrence-free survival (RFS), but all available long-term survival projections do not plateau, even after optimal local therapy. In particular, RFS or local control (LC) of skull-base chordomas at 5 and 10 years is 47–76% and 42–71%, respectively, while 5- and 10-year estimated RFS for mobile spine chordomas is 58% and 32%. Similarly, the 5-, 10- and 15-year local relapse (LR) incidence is reported to be 30%, 46% and 57%, respectively, in a recently published series of primary and completely resected sacral chordomas. In this study, a plateau in RFS was not observed even at 15 years.

Chordoma — relapsed disease highlights that distant metastases have been reported in up to 40% of patients with local recurrence and that among recurrent skull base/spine cases, 2-year actuarial overall survival was higher with subtotal resection than supportive care only (63% and 21%, respectively; P = 0.001); a study of 25 patients reported effective local control and low acute toxicity with carbon ion RT. Some studies have reported that surgery and RT are associated with lower local control rates for recurrent tumors than for primary tumors in sacral chordomas. Patients with recurrent disease can be treated with surgery and/or RT and/or systemic therapy, and systemic options include imatinib (with or without cisplatin or sirolimus), dasatinib, sunitinib, erlotinib, lapatinib (for EGFR-positive disease), and sorafenib; CGP with a validated and/or FDA-approved assay should be considered to determine targeted therapy options.

Baseline patient evaluation

Prior to treatment, a complete physical examination and neurological assessment should be performed. For skull-base chordomas, endocrinological, ophthalmological and audiological examination are suggested. The patient's symptoms and pace of symptom progression should be noted. Pain assessment should be performed using a 0–10 pain assessment scale. Chronic pain secondary to RT or surgery should be distinguished from acute symptoms related to tumor progression for purposes of considering treatment approaches.

The evaluation should also include a detailed review of notes describing prior resections and/or RT, including but not limited to fields, dose and type of RT. The location of previous incisions or biopsies should be noted in relationship to new tumor lesion(s) for purposes of surgical planning.

Resection of recurrent or progressive disease

For mobile spine and sacral tumors, the goal of salvage surgery with curative intent should be to achieve en-bloc resection with negative surgical margins (IV-B). Particular attention should be paid to avoid tumor rupture, as this is associated with significant risk of tumor seeding. Recurrences in the skull-base or neck, as well as in the intrathoracic, intra-abdominal or intra-pelvic areas, are usually not amenable to margin negative/R0 resections, and therefore surgery should be aimed at a gross total resection (IV-B). For skull-base tumors R1 resection should be the goal of surgical treatment in all cases, in order to reduce tumor volume and increase the effectiveness of subsequent RT (V-A).

Debulking surgery should be cautiously considered only in certain rare cases, as it is unlikely to prolong survival. When subtotal resection is performed, every effort should be made to minimize contamination of the surrounding tissues (V-B).

When no prior RT had been delivered, post-operative RT should be considered, especially when microscopic margins were positive/R1. A component of preoperative RT can also be considered.

Radiotherapy of recurrence

RT can be delivered both with curative or palliative intent. To achieve local control in recurrent chordoma it is necessary to give a biologically high-dose while limiting the cumulative dose delivered to the critical structures near the target volume (IV-B). The feasibility and utility of RT for patients with recurrent chordoma depends primarily on whether or not the patient received RT to the same area as part of primary management. Thus, recommendations are presented below for two scenarios: patients without and with previous irradiation.

---

### Best practices for the management of local-regional recurrent chordoma: a position paper by the chordoma global consensus group [^6f8eb550]. Annals of Oncology (2017). Low credibility.

' Salvage radiotherapy with curative intent' should be offered with the same dose and techniques as employed in first-line therapy. Thus, in case of recurrence in patients not previously treated with RT, definitive RT alone (e.g. without debulking) is a reasonable alternative to surgery plus radiation, although neither is very effective (V-C). Comparative effectiveness data for these approaches are limited and additional research is needed to determine which approach is superior. Patients considering definitive RT need to be informed about the risk of late toxicities from high-dose radiation (IV-B).

In the case of recurrent disease after previous RT, a new course of RT is indicated only when (i) this can be delivered without exceeding the estimated dose constraints on organs at risk (OARs) and (ii) adequate coverage of target volumes can be achieved. If this is not feasible, other treatment modalities are preferable (V-C). Currently, the cumulative dose tolerance for key OARs and the potentially protective role of partial damage repair after the first course of RT are still largely unknown. When complete resection of a recurrent lesion is not feasible, and proximity to critical structures precludes adequate RT coverage of target volumes, debulking surgery may be an appropriate option in order to separate critical structures from the residual tumor, thereby allowing delivery of a tolerable radiation dose.

Medical therapy

Medical therapy is an appropriate palliative option for patients whose disease is actively progressing or who are symptomatic. A brief observation period may be warranted before starting medical therapy to determine whether, and at what rate, the disease is progressing. If no progression is detected, it may be more appropriate to continue with active surveillance.

Currently, medical therapy options are limited and no drugs are approved for the treatment of advanced chordoma. However, several targeted therapies have shown modest activity in patients with recurrent disease. Imatinib and sorafenib are the agents with the greatest evidence of efficacy in advanced chordoma and represent reasonable palliative treatment options to slow disease progression or alleviate symptoms (V*-B). Access to these drugs varies widely among countries, posing a challenge for patients in some areas. In addition, several case reports have noted activity of sunitinib and EGFR inhibitors (cetuximab, erlotinib, gefitinib).

Cytotoxic chemotherapy is generally inactive, and there is insufficient evidence to recommend it (V-D). However, there are anecdotal reports of responses to chemotherapy in high-grade/dedifferentiated chordoma and in some pediatric cases.

Although no predictors of response to targeted agents have been identified in chordoma, molecular profiling of tumors may help guide selection of experimental therapies. One potentially relevant biomarker is INI1 loss, which has been reported in dedifferentiated chordomas and may confer sensitivity to EZH2 inhibitors.

A more detailed and up to date description of published data on medical therapy in chordoma is provided in supplementary Appendix 2, available at Annals of Oncology online.

### Management of sacrococcygeal chordoma: a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies [^e5980075]. Spine (2018). Low credibility.

Study Design

Systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies.

Objective

The aim of the study is to evaluate different treatment modalities in the management of sacrococcygeal chordoma.

Summary Of Background Data

Chordomas are primary malignant bone tumors associated with considerable morbidity and mortality.

Methods

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central-Register of Controlled Trials, and Scopus from inception to July 2015. Eligible studies included patients with sacrococcygeal chordoma treated exclusively with surgery, radiotherapy, or both. Two reviewers independently assessed the eligibility of potential studies, risk of bias, and extracted data. Outcomes of interest were all-cause mortality, progression-free survival, and metastases. We analyzed further surgical outcomes by resection margin. All outcomes were assessed at 60 months and more than 60 months following intervention.

Results

We included 33 noncomparative studies reporting on 501 patients (mean age 57 years). Overall mortality rate was (16%) after surgical resection with adjuvant radiotherapy and (28%) after surgical resection, and (43%) after radiotherapy (P = 0.28). All-cause mortality following wide surgical resection was (32%) compared to (40%) after marginal resection (P = 0.51). Overall progression-free survival rate was (58%) after surgical resection with adjuvant radiotherapy and (55%) after surgery (P = 0.92). However, at more than 60 months follow-up, progression-free survival rates were significantly higher (P = 0.024) following surgical resection with adjuvant radiotherapy (74%) in comparison to surgery (55%) and radiotherapy (36%). Overall progression-free survival rates were nonsignificantly higher after wide surgical resection (66%) than marginal resection (33%) (P = 0.16). However, at 60 months follow-up, progression-free survival rates were significantly higher following wide surgical resection (73%) than marginal resection (33%) (P = 0.047).

Conclusion

Sacrococcygeal chordoma is a difficult to treat disease entity. Until comparative studies become available, wide surgical resection and multidisciplinary management are the recommended approaches to improve patient outcomes.

### Best practices for the management of local-regional recurrent chordoma: a position paper by the chordoma global consensus group [^3b265e31]. Annals of Oncology (2017). Low credibility.

' Salvage palliative/supportive treatment choices' include debulking surgery, low-dose RT, stereotactic body RT (SBRT), including radiosurgery to small volume, radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and other loco-regional approaches (i.e. cryotherapy), systemic therapy, PC and observation. The patient's symptom burden should guide the selection of an appropriate therapeutic approach as the potential for cure is nil. Care should be taken to avoid aggressive therapies that could cause unnecessary additional morbidity. Maximal debulking surgery should only be considered to alleviate or prevent symptoms related to nerve/cord/brain compression or for separating vital structures from the tumor to allow for radiation of the residual disease (V-C). This type of surgery is indeed only a temporizing measure, as local disease that remains after surgery will regrow in the region. Particular caution should be exercised in performing surgery near prior high-dose RT (IV-C) as the risk of surgical complications is dramatically greater in this setting. Additionally, the oncologic outcome generally deteriorates, and the chance of mortality and serious morbidity increases, with each serial resection (IV-B). Low-dose re-irradiation with palliative intent can be considered in selected case if it can be performed with negligible risk of toxicity (V-C).

'PC' should be considered as part of the active management of all patients and should include pain and symptom control, discussion about a patient's concerns and wishes, a conversation about advanced directives, and evaluation of patient and family psychosocial needs.

' Salvage palliative anticancer medical therapy' should be considered to attempt to stop tumor growth and/or alleviate symptoms in cases not amenable to local treatment or when symptomatic relief is needed, taking into consideration the PS, co-morbidities, expected treatment-related side effects, and the patient's preferences (V*-B).

Chordoma — surgical management and outcomes: Wide excision with adequate margins is the preferred primary treatment for patients with resectable chordoma, and retrospective data suggest that surgery is associated with improved overall survival (OS). Among mobile spine cases, only margin-free en bloc resection was associated with continuous disease-free survival (DFS) with a follow-up of > 5 years; 12 of 18 patients were continuously disease-free at an average of 8 years, whereas all patients treated with intralesional excision had recurrences in < 2 years. Following en-bloc resection of sacral chordomas, a local recurrence rate of 14.8% and a distant disease recurrence rate of 7.4% were reported in 27 patients. Positive or < 2 mm resection margins were associated with disease progression in 40.7% of patients. In cranial base chordomas, gross total removal was achieved in 72% of patients with local control rates of 50%. In a 10-year meta-analysis of skull base chordomas (n = 802), incomplete resection was 3.83 times more likely to result in recurrence at 5 years than complete resection. In sacrococcygeal chordomas, overall mortality was lowest with surgical resection followed by adjuvant radiation therapy (RT) at 16% versus surgery alone at 28% or RT alone at 43%, and progression-free survival (PFS) at 60 months was higher after surgery with adjuvant RT at 74% versus only surgery at 55% or only RT at 36%.

Chordoma — primary treatment and surveillance: Wide excision with or without adjuvant RT is the primary treatment option for resectable sacrum/mobile spine disease, while intralesional excision with or without adjuvant RT is the treatment of choice for resectable skull base/clival tumors; maximal safe excision is recommended when appropriate. Adjuvant treatment with RT can be considered for large extra-compartmental tumors or for positive surgical margins, postoperative RT has been associated with improved local control and DFS after macroscopic surgical margins or intralesional excision, and re-excision, if necessary, can be considered for skull base tumors with positive surgical margins. Definitive RT is the primary treatment option for unresectable chordomas. Surveillance consists of a physical exam and imaging of the primary site for up to 10 years, and chest imaging every 6 months for 5 years and annually thereafter, with modality/contrast use as clinically indicated.

### Soft tissue sarcoma treatment (PDQ ®)-NCI… [^24642da5]. NCI (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical Features Soft tissue sarcomas are a heterogenous family of malignant tumors that may arise in nearly any organ system. The anatomical distribution in adults is as follows:

- Extremities.
- Intra-abdominal organs.
- Trunk.
- Head and neck. Diagnostic Evaluation Adequate tissue should be obtained via either image-guided core-needle biopsy or planned incisional biopsy. The samples should be reviewed by a pathologist who is experienced in diagnosing sarcomas. Careful planning of the initial biopsy, with consultation among the surgeon, radiation oncologist, and interventional radiologist, is important to avoid compromising subsequent curative resection. In general, incisional biopsies are reserved for patients whose prior core-needle biopsies were nondiagnostic or when a core-needle biopsy cannot be safely performed because of anatomical constraints.

Before any intervention is initiated, imaging is performed to evaluate the sarcoma and determine if there are metastases. The following modalities may be used as clinically indicated:

- Plain radiography.
- Computed tomography.
- Magnetic resonance imaging.
- Positron emission tomography scan and bone scan. May be used along with CT. PET imaging is particularly useful for sarcoma subtypes with a propensity for lymph node metastases. Small low-grade tumors, particularly in the trunk or extremities, are frequently curable by surgery alone. Higher-grade sarcomas are associated with higher local-treatment failure rates and increased metastatic potential. Prognostic nomograms have been developed for soft tissue sarcomas of the retroperitoneum and the extremities.

Some staging evaluation procedures depend on the tumor histology and site, including:

- CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis and whole spine MRI for round cell and myxoid liposarcomas, as these histologies can have extrapulmonary spread to unusual sites.
- Brain imaging for subtypes that have a higher propensity for central nervous system involvement, such as angiosarcoma, epithelioid sarcoma, or alveolar soft-part sarcoma. Knowledge of intracompartmental or extracompartmental extension of extremity sarcomas is important for surgical decision making. For complete staging, a thorough review of all biopsy specimens, including those from the primary tumor, lymph nodes, or other suspicious lesions, is essential. Nodal involvement is rare, occurring in less than 3% of patients with sarcoma, but it occurs more often in certain subtypes, such as rhabdomyosarcoma, angiosarcoma, synovial sarcoma, clear cell sarcoma, and epithelioid sarcoma.

Treatment Option Overview for Soft Tissue Sarcoma Planning Therapy Complete staging and treatment planning by a multidisciplinary team of cancer specialists is required to determine the optimal treatment for patients with soft tissue sarcoma. In most cases, a combined modality approach of preoperative radiation therapy or postoperative radiation therapy is used for treatment, rather than a radical surgical procedure such as amputation. Surgery without PORT may be possible in selected cases. The role of chemotherapy is not well defined. Specialized centers There is evidence that favorable clinical outcomes may be associated with referral to a specialized sarcoma treatment center. Evidence:

- The rate of local recurrence was 19% for patients treated at the specialized center.

RT in patients without previous irradiation

Salvage RT with curative intent should be offered with the same modality employed for first line therapy (V-C). Since chordomas are radioresistant, a dose of at least 74 GyE should be delivered, using conventional fractionation (1.8–2 GyE) for photon and proton therapy (V*-A); moderately hypofractionated schedules can be used with carbon ions with dose per fractions ranging between 3 and 4.4 Gy RBE and total doses ranging from 60 and 70.4 Gy RBE. Prior to RT, surgical re-resection should be discussed in all cases. Target volumes should be delineated considering the primary tumor location and its recurrence. The high-dose volume should include any macroscopic disease as well as surgical margins, while the low-dose volume should encompass areas at risk of microscopic spread, skip metastases, or seeding due to surgical procedures. In selected cases, a radio-surgical approach to gross disease may be appropriate, although there is no consensus as of yet about the criteria for recommending it.

### Chordoma: current concepts, management, and future directions [^585c0426]. The Lancet: Oncology (2012). Medium credibility.

Chordoma is a rare bone cancer that is aggressive, locally invasive, and has a poor prognosis. Chordomas are thought to arise from transformed remnants of notochord and have a predilection for the axial skeleton, with the most common sites being the sacrum, skull base, and spine. The gold standard treatment for chordomas of the mobile spine and sacrum is en-bloc excision with wide margins and postoperative external-beam radiation therapy. Treatment of clival chordomas is unique from other locations with an enhanced emphasis on preservation of neurological function, typified by a general paradigm of maximally safe cytoreductive surgery and advanced radiation delivery techniques. In this Review, we highlight current standards in diagnosis, clinical management, and molecular characterisation of chordomas, and discuss current research.

Figure 1.
Flow-charts summarizing the recommended treatment strategy for patients with local-regional recurrence. MR, magnetic resonance; CT, computerized tomography; prog. progressioni; WB, whole body; REF, reference; RT, radiotherapy.

Patients who experience LR should be evaluated by a multidisciplinary team including at least a medical oncologist, radiotherapist, surgeon, pathologist, radiologist and PC specialist with expertise in chordoma. This recommendation is consistent with best practice for managing musculoskeletal neoplasms.

The presence/absence of symptoms should be factored in the decision-making algorithm. It is important to involve the patient when deciding which treatment to pursue.

The 'extent of local disease' should be determined using intra-venous contrast-enhanced MRI. In addition, restaging with total body computed tomography scan (CT) and whole spine MRI with a thorough clinical examination should complement loco-regional assessment to rule out distant metastases and/or subarachnoid spread.

'Histological confirmation' of recurrent disease is needed when there is diagnostic uncertainty, or when there is the suspicion of tumor dedifferentiation (e.g. unusually fast growth), or of a secondary malignancy. In cases where a tumor relapse is uncertain, a period of observation and re-imaging is an appropriate alternative to histologic assessment. A biopsy can be considered in selected cases for directing medical therapy.

' Salvage treatment choices with curative intent' can include surgery and/or RT, balancing morbidity, QOL and expected disease control. Surgical and RT strategy should be guided by the nature and extent of the previous procedure(s), the location of the recurrence, tumor resectability, deliverability of RT and the expected added morbidity of each procedure. Other relevant factors to consider include age, comorbidity, performance status (PS), and status of the surrounding tissues including the skin. The choice between surgery alone, surgery + RT, and RT alone must be based on individual case assessment; to date, there are no specific data to back generalized recommendations. A period of observation and re-imaging may help select best candidates for resection/RT or both. In particular, postponing active therapy can be considered in case of stable disease and/or no progression of symptoms.

### Evidence-based optimization of post-treatment surveillance for skull base chordomas based on local and distant disease progression [^d9c1f834]. Operative Neurosurgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

There are no guidelines regarding post-treatment surveillance specific to skull base chordomas.

Objective

To determine an optimal imaging surveillance schedule to detect both local and distant metastatic skull base chordoma recurrences.

Methods

A retrospective review of 91 patients who underwent treatment for skull base chordoma between 1993 and 2017 was conducted. Time to and location of local and distant recurrence(s) were cataloged. Existing chordoma surveillance recommendations (National Comprehensive Cancer Network [NCCN], London and South East Sarcoma Network [LSESN], European Society for Medical Oncology [ESMO], Chordoma Global Consensus Group [CGCG]) were applied to our cohort to compare the number of recurrent patients and months of undiagnosed tumor growth between surveillances. These findings were used to inform the creation of a revised imaging surveillance protocol (MD Anderson Cancer Center Chordoma Imaging Protocol [MDACC-CIP]), presented here.

Results

Thirty-four patients with 79 local/systemic recurrences met inclusion criteria. Mean age at diagnosis and follow-up time were 45 yr and 79 mo, respectively. The MDACC-CIP imaging protocol significantly reduced the time to diagnosis of recurrence compared with the LSESN and CGCG/ESMO imaging protocols for surveillance of local disease with a cumulative/average of 576/16.9 (LSESN), 336/9.8 (CGCG), and 170/5.0 (MDACC-CIP) months of undetected growth, respectively. The NCCN and MDACC-CIP guidelines for distant metastatic surveillance identified a cumulative/average of 65/6.5 and 51/5.1 mo of undetected growth, respectively, and were not significantly different.

Conclusion

The MDACC-CIP for skull base chordoma accounts for recurrence trends unique to this disease, including a higher rate of leptomeningeal spread than sacrococcygeal primaries, resulting in improved sensitivity and prompt diagnosis.

NCCN Bone Cancer — chordoma surgery emphasizes margin-negative resection and outcomes: Wide excision with adequate margins is the preferred primary treatment for resectable chordoma, and surgery is associated with improved overall survival. Among mobile spine cases, only margin-free en bloc resection was associated with continuous disease-free survival (DFS) with a follow-up of > 5 years; 12 of 18 patients were continuously disease-free at an average of 8 years after en bloc resection, whereas all patients treated with intralesional excision recurred in < 2 years. Following en-bloc resection of sacral chordomas, single-center data reported a local recurrence rate of 14.8% and distant disease recurrence rate of 7.4% in 27 patients. Positive or < 2 mm resection margins were associated with disease progression in 40.7% of patients. In cranial base chordomas, gross total removal was achieved in 72% of patients resulting in local control rates of 50%. A 10-year meta-analysis of 802 skull base chordoma patients found incomplete resection was 3.83 times more likely to result in recurrence at 5 years compared with complete resection. In a meta-analysis of 33 noncomparative sacrococcygeal chordoma studies, overall mortality was lowest with surgery plus adjuvant radiation therapy (RT) at 16% versus surgery alone at 28% or RT alone at 43%, and progression-free survival (PFS) at 60 months was higher after surgery with adjuvant RT (74%) than surgery (55%) or RT (36%).

Chordoma — primary treatment (NCCN recommendations) emphasizes that tumor location is the most important variable for choosing initial therapy in conventional or chondroid chordomas. Wide excision with or without adjuvant radiation therapy (RT) is the primary treatment option for resectable sacrum and mobile spine tumors, whereas intralesional excision with or without adjuvant RT, followed by contrast-enhanced MRI to assess adequacy of resection, is the treatment of choice for resectable skull base/clival tumors. Maximal safe excision is recommended when appropriate; adjuvant RT can be considered for large extra-compartmental tumors or positive surgical margins, postoperative RT has been associated with improved local control and disease-free survival after macroscopic margins or intralesional excision, and re-excision can be considered for skull base tumors with positive margins. Definitive RT is the primary treatment option for unresectable chordomas irrespective of location.

### Diagnosis and treatment of chordoma [^5a19c62a]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2013). Low credibility.

Chordoma is a primary bone cancer arising on the midline from the skull base to the sacrum. Diagnosis is often delayed because of insidious onset and nonspecific symptoms. Chordomas appear histologically low-grade but are highly invasive and often recur locally. Management centers primarily on radical en bloc surgical resection when possible. Radiation therapy using protons and/or photons is often necessary because complete resection is seldom possible due to critical location and invasion of the cancer cells into surrounding structures. No approved medical therapy exists. The high rate of recurrence is reflected by a median survival of 6 to 7 years. This article reviews the clinical management of chordoma and discusses ongoing research in the field.

### Current treatment strategy for newly diagnosed chordoma of the mobile spine and sacrum: results of an international survey [^e605e4ff]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Spine (2019). Medium credibility.

OBJECTIVEThe purpose of this study was to investigate the spectrum of current treatment protocols for managing newly diagnosed chordoma of the mobile spine and sacrum.METHODSA survey on the treatment of spinal chordoma was distributed electronically to members of the AOSpine Knowledge Forum Tumor, including neurosurgeons, orthopedic surgeons, and radiation oncologists from North America, South America, Europe, Asia, and Australia. Survey participants were pre-identified clinicians from centers with expertise in the treatment of spinal tumors. The suvey responses were analyzed using descriptive statistics.RESULTSThirty-nine of 43 (91%) participants completed the survey. Most (80%) indicated that they favor en bloc resection without preoperative neoadjuvant radiation therapy (RT) when en bloc resection is feasible with acceptable morbidity. The main area of disagreement was with the role of postoperative RT, where 41% preferred giving RT only if positive margins were achieved and 38% preferred giving RT irrespective of margin status. When en bloc resection would result in significant morbidity, 33% preferred planned intralesional resection followed by RT, and 33% preferred giving neoadjuvant RT prior to surgery. In total, 8 treatment protocols were identified: 3 in which en bloc resection is feasible with acceptable morbidity and 5 in which en bloc resection would result in significant morbidity.CONCLUSIONSThe results confirm that there is treatment variability across centers worldwide for managing newly diagnosed chordoma of the mobile spine and sacrum. This information will be used to design an international prospective cohort study to determine the most appropriate treatment strategy for patients with spinal chordoma.

### Chordoma of the sacrum and vertebral bodies [^ba358d34]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2009). Low credibility.

Chordomas are relatively rare tumors of bone. These primary malignant lesions occur throughout the spinal column and often show advanced growth at the time of diagnosis. Because such tumors are minimally responsive to radiation and chemotherapy, surgical resection is the mainstay of treatment. Patient survival and local control are associated with the ability to achieve wide surgical margins during excision. However, surgical morbidity may be substantial given the propensity for chordomas to abut or surround neural, vascular, and visceral structures. Thus, early recognition is essential, and treatment by a multidisciplinary team is ideal.

### Best practices for the management of local-regional recurrent chordoma: a position paper by the chordoma global consensus group [^3755f0b4]. Annals of Oncology (2017). Low credibility.

Metal implants (e.g. for spine stabilization) complicate RT delivery by creating artifacts in CT/MRI images. This can interfere with precise delineation of target and OAR, especially in the spinal canal. Additionally, these artifacts affect range calculation for particle therapy, and, therefore, may result in an additional uncertainty in delivered dose. Consequently, the presence of metal implants may be a key factor in deciding not to deliver curative RT or in deciding to deliver it with photons, which are less sensitive to artifacts, instead of particles (IV-B). If a debulking or a separating surgery is planned, the possibility of modifying, removing or substituting metal implants with carbon fiber devices should be considered to enable radiation with potentially curative intent; however, this is appropriate only in very well selected cases after thorough multidisciplinary assessment.

Other local therapies

Retrospective data suggest that cryoablation and RFA can be safe and useful palliative treatments in recurrent extracranial chordomas with a benefit in pain control. However, prospective studies are needed before recommending these procedures in chordoma.

SBRT, including radiosurgery, has been described in retrospective and prospective series as safe and effective salvage strategy for spine tumors that have recurred after prior RT. SBRT has been suggested as a palliative treatment option also in chordoma patients who suffer LR after prior RT, nevertheless prospective confirmatory data are necessary to make any definitive recommendations.

In principle, other local therapies such as local microwave hyperthermia and high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) may also offer benefit in a palliative setting; however, currently there are no published data supporting their use.

Chordoma — radiation therapy roles and outcomes: Radiation therapy (RT) (preoperative, postoperative, or intraoperative) is used in combination with surgery to improve local control and disease-free survival (DFS), with retrospective studies and case series demonstrating improved local control and DFS using combined surgical/RT approaches for spinal/sacral and clival/skull base chordomas. In a retrospective review of 1478 patients, among those with positive margins, 5-year survival was significantly higher with adjuvant RT than with surgery alone (82.3% vs. 70.6%; P = 0.03), whereas adjuvant RT after surgery did not improve survival among patients with negative margins. Particle beam RT with high‑energy protons or carbon ions resulted in local control rates ranging from 46% to 92%. For carbon ion RT in skull-base chordomas, the 5- and 10-year local control rates were 80% and 56%, respectively. A prospective trial of high-dose photon/proton RT in 50 spine bone sarcomas (n = 29 chordoma, 14 chondrosarcoma, 7 other histologies) reported 5- and 8-year actuarial local control rates of 94%.

Data sources

Literature review

The PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) flow diagram details our study selection process. Initially, a systematic search of the literature was performed on MEDLINE and Web of Science from inception to March 2024, using the keywords "spinal," "chordoma," and "pediatric" in all logical permutations (Supplementary file 1). This search identified 248 records. Two authors independently screened these records for eligibility (V.G.E. and S.R.). Conflicts were resolved by discussion followed by unanimous decision. Exclusion criteria included non-English studies, studies on adult patients, and those with chordomas localized outside the spine (including both mobile and sacral spine). Studies were also excluded if they were of an unsuitable publication type (narrative reviews, conference abstracts, book chapters) and/or if individual patient data could not be extracted. All other studies were eligible for inclusion, without any restrictions with respect to the outcome studied. Records were initially screened based on their titles and abstracts, with studies meeting any of the exclusion criteria excluded at this stage. In the second step, the full texts of the remaining records were reviewed to determine their eligibility for inclusion in the review. Reference lists of the eligible articles were also screened to identify articles missed by the initial search. A total of 41 studies were included in the final review (Fig. 1, Supplementary file 2). Data on age, sex, tumor location, treatment used including: surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy, extent of tumor resection, follow-up time, and outcomes including distant metastases, local recurrence, and mortality were extracted from the manuscript included in the review, as available.

### Intensity modulated radiotherapy in the management of sacral chordoma in primary versus recurrent disease [^c7024150]. Radiotherapy and Oncology (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose

To investigate treatment outcome in patients suffering from sacral chordoma after intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) for primary versus recurrent disease.

Material/Methods

We report on 34 patients with histologically proven sacral chordoma. Seventeen patients were treated at time of initial diagnosis with post-operative IMRT (n = 13) or with IMRT alone (n = 4). Seventeen patients were treated in recurrent disease after surgery (n = 11) or with radiotherapy alone (n = 6). Median total dose to the boost volume (PTV2) was 66 Gy (range, 72–54) with 2 Gy per fraction using an integrated boost concept. Median dose to target volume (PTV1) was 54 Gy in 1.8 Gy.

Results

Local control was 35% (12/34) and overall survival 74% (25/34) after a median follow-up of 4.5 years. Actuarial local control was 79%, 55% and 27% after 1, 2 and 5 years, respectively. Local control was significantly higher in patients treated for primary tumors (p < 0.03) and in total doses > 60 Gy (p < 0.01). Actuarial overall survival was 97%, 91% and 70% after 1, 2 and 5 years, respectively.

Conclusion

These data demonstrate that local control after IMRT is higher in patients treated for primary tumors and using higher radiation doses. Therefore, we recommend radiotherapy as part of initial treatment in sacral chordoma.

Chordoma — clinical features and prognostic notes: Poorly differentiated chordoma is characterized by absence of SMARCB1 expression, may be more common in the pediatric population with a predilection for the skull base and cervical spine, and is considered more aggressive than conventional or chondroid variants with a poorer OS. Chordomas of the spine and sacrum present with localized deep pain or radiculopathies, cervical chordomas can cause airway obstruction or dysphagia and might present as an oropharyngeal mass, and neurologic deficit is more often associated with skull base and mobile spine chordomas than sacrococcygeal. A review of 47 patients with skull base chordomas suggested male sex was associated with worse PFS and OS.

NCCN Bone Cancer — radiation therapy (RT) for chordoma details use with surgery and particle therapy outcomes: RT (preoperative, postoperative, or intraoperative) is used in combination with surgery to improve local control and disease-free survival (DFS) for resectable chordomas. In a retrospective review of 1,478 resected skull base, sacral, and mobile spine chordomas, among patients with positive margins the 5-year survival rate was higher with adjuvant RT than surgery alone (82.3% vs. 70.6%; P = 0.03), whereas adjuvant RT did not improve survival with negative margins. Particle beam RT with high-energy protons or carbon ions yielded local control rates ranging from 46% to 92% in skull base and extracranial chordomas; with carbon ion RT, the 5- and 10-year local control rates were 80% and 56%, respectively. A prospective trial of high-dose photon/proton RT in 50 spine bone sarcoma patients (n = 29 chordoma, 14 chondrosarcoma, 7 other histologies) reported 5- and 8-year actuarial local control rates of 94%.

### Multidisciplinary surgical considerations for en bloc resection of sacral chordoma: review of recent advances and a contemporary single-center series [^8ef6fe22]. Neurosurgical Focus (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

Contemporary management of sacral chordomas requires maximizing the potential for recurrence-free and overall survival while minimizing treatment morbidity. En bloc resection can be performed at various levels of the sacrum, with tumor location and volume ultimately dictating the necessary extent of resection and subsequent tissue reconstruction. Because tumor resection involving the upper sacrum may be quite destabilizing, other pertinent considerations relate to instrumentation and subsequent tissue reconstruction. The primary aim of this study was to survey the surgical approaches used for managing primary sacral chordoma according to location of lumbosacral spine involvement, including a narrative review of the literature and examination of the authors' institutional case series.

Methods

The authors performed a narrative review of pertinent literature regarding reconstruction and complication avoidance techniques following en bloc resection of primary sacral tumors, supplemented by a contemporary series of 11 cases from their cohort. Relevant surgical anatomy, advances in instrumentation and reconstruction techniques, intraoperative imaging and navigation, soft-tissue reconstruction, and wound complication avoidance are also discussed.

Results

The review of the literature identified several surgical approaches used for management of primary sacral chordoma localized to low sacral levels (mid-S2 and below), high sacral levels (involving upper S2 and above), and high sacral levels with lumbar involvement. In the contemporary case series, the majority of cases (8/11) presented as low sacral tumors that did not require instrumentation. A minority required more extensive instrumentation and reconstruction, with 2 tumors involving upper S2 and/or S1 levels and 1 tumor extending into the lower lumbar spine. En bloc resection was successfully achieved in 10 of 11 cases, with a colostomy required in 2 cases due to rectal involvement. All 11 cases underwent musculocutaneous flap wound closure by plastic surgery, with none experiencing wound complications requiring revision.

Conclusions

The modern management of sacral chordoma involves a multidisciplinary team of surgeons and intraoperative technologies to minimize surgical morbidity while optimizing oncological outcomes through en bloc resection. Most cases present with lower sacral tumors not requiring instrumentation, but stabilizing instrumentation and lumbosacral reconstruction are often required in upper sacral and lumbosacral cases. Among efforts to minimize wound-related complications, musculocutaneous flap closure stands out as an evidence-based measure that may mitigate risk.

Follow-up and survivorship

Follow-up after treatment aims to detect local and systemic recurrence, manage long-term toxicity of chemotherapy and radiotherapy and the complications of surgery. Local recurrences are often detected by patients and therefore information about what to do if local recurrence is suspected should be provided.

Clinical follow-up of patients treated for high-grade tumours should include physical examination of the primary tumour site, and assessment of the functional outcome and possible complications of any reconstruction. Local and chest imaging should be included. Evidence for the optimum frequency of follow-up and the best imaging investigations is lacking although a randomised controlled trial showed no benefit of greater frequency of follow-up with regular cross-sectional imaging over standard follow-up.

Current protocols recommend follow-up at intervals of 2–4 months for the first 3 years after completion of therapy, every 6 months for years 4 and 5 and thereafter annually. Modelling of metastatic events suggests chest surveillance annually to 5 years for low-grade sarcomas, every 3 months for 2 years then annually to ten years for intermediate-grade sarcomas, and every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months from 2 to 5 years and annually from years 5 to 10 for high-grade sarcomas.

For low-grade bone sarcomas, the frequency of follow-up visits can be reduced to 4–6 monthly for 2 years and then annually. Late metastases as well as local recurrences and failure of reconstructions may occur more than 10 years after diagnosis in all tumours and there is no universally accepted stopping point for follow-up.

Although evidence for local site imaging is lacking, for chordoma the high risk of occult local recurrence warrants MRI of the primary site at 6 months, 1 year and then annually to ten years. Similarly, in patients at high risk of occult local recurrence such as after resection of pelvic chondrosarcoma, regular MRI of the primary site may be reasonable. Plain X-rays of the local site are standard to detect radiological local recurrence and potential complications of the surgical reconstruction.

### Childhood chordoma treatment (PDQ ®)-NCI… [^4643b035]. NCI (2019). Medium credibility.

Childhood Chordoma Treatment –Health Professional Version Incidence Chordoma is a very rare tumor of bone. It arises from remnants of the notochord within the clivus, spinal vertebrae, or sacrum. The most common site in children is the cranium. The incidence in the United States is approximately 1 case per 1 million people per year. Only 5% of all chordomas occur in patients younger than 20 years. Most pediatric patients have the classical or chondroid variant of chordoma, while the dedifferentiated variant is rare in children. Clinical Presentation and Diagnosis Patients with chordomas usually present with pain or diplopia. Patients may also present with or without neurological deficits such as cranial or other nerve impairment. The diagnosis of a chordoma is straightforward when the typical physaliferous cells are present.

The differential diagnosis is sometimes difficult and includes dedifferentiated chordoma and chondrosarcoma. Childhood chordoma has been associated with tuberous sclerosis complex.
- A retrospective literature review and review of institutional patients identified 682 patients with spinal chordomas. The median age of patients was 57 years.
- Age younger than 18 years, sacral spine tumor location, dedifferentiated pathology, and treatment with chemotherapy were associated with a lower probability for progression-free survival.
- Younger age, older age, bladder or bowel dysfunction at presentation, dedifferentiated pathology, disease recurrence or progression, and metastatic disease were associated with a worse OS.
- Histopathology is also an important prognostic factor. Patients who have tumors with typical or chondroid pathology have worse outcomes than patients who have tumors with classical pathology.
- A multicenter retrospective study identified 40 children with chordomas.
- Most of the patients had the histologically classical form of chordoma.
- Most of the chordomas were located at the skull base.
- Loss of BAF47 immunoexpression appeared to be a significant independent adverse prognostic factor.
- A retrospective analysis identified seven children with poorly differentiated chordomas.
- The median survival of these patients was 9 months.
- All poorly differentiated chordomas showed loss of. SMARCB1expression by immunohistochemistry. Copy number profiles were derived from intensity measures of the methylation probes and indicated 22q losses affecting the SMARCB1region in all poorly differentiated chordomas.

Inactivation of the SMARCB1gene is common in poorly differentiated chordomas of childhood, and it is associated with a poor prognosis.

Special Considerations for the Treatment of Children With Cancer Cancer in children and adolescents is rare, although the overall incidence has slowly increased since 1975. Children and adolescents with cancer should be referred to medical centers that have a multidisciplinary team of cancer specialists with experience treating the cancers that occur during childhood and adolescence. This multidisciplinary team approach incorporates the skills of the following pediatric specialists and others to ensure that children receive treatment, supportive care, and rehabilitation to achieve optimal survival and quality of life:

Chordoma — skull base/clival management states intralesional excision ± adjuvant RT if resectable, followed by follow-up contrast-enhanced MRI of the primary site to assess adequacy of excision. Adjuvant treatment advises to consider adjuvant RT for positive surgical margins or for large extracompartmental tumors and to consider re-excision if necessary, then proceed to Surveillance (CHOR-3). If unresectable, consider definitive RT. Maximal safe excision is noted, and maximal tumor removal is recommended when appropriate; RT may be given preoperatively, intraoperatively, and/or postoperatively.
