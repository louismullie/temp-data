## Question

Best management for chronic interstitial cystitis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the best management strategies for chronic interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the condition's heterogeneity and the implications for individualized, phenotype-directed care. Then, I should verify the overarching management principles from major guidelines. Next, I will examine first-line conservative and behavioral therapies, followed by oral pharmacologic options and their evidence. After that, I need to review intravesical therapies and procedural options, including special handling of Hunner lesions. I will then consider neuromodulation and surgical pathways, pain management strategies, and the role of multidisciplinary care. Finally, I should integrate a practical, iterative algorithm and highlight what to avoid, while double-checking areas of controversy and evidence limitations.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame: IC/BPS is a heterogeneous chronic pain syndrome with bladder-centric symptoms and overlapping central sensitization, so a one-size-fits-all approach fails. I need to ensure we individualize by phenotype, symptom clusters, and patient preferences, and I should remember that pain and urinary symptoms covary but are not identical and should be assessed separately, which is supported by MAPP and contemporary guideline perspectives [^114wnEEa] [^117BQrMA] [^1117SAC8].

> Wait, let me verify the overarching principles before diving into specifics: guidelines converge on shared decision-making, starting with nonsurgical care except for Hunner lesions, using a multimodal strategy, reassessing efficacy periodically and stopping ineffective therapies, and escalating to multidisciplinary care if pain remains inadequately controlled. I should also confirm that we set expectations about waxing/waning symptoms and the need for sequential trials of therapy [^116V3Frr] [^112Fq4ED] [^114tALFt] [^112CK8ba] [^1116HYLX].

> I will now examine first-line conservative and behavioral therapies. Hold on, I should verify that education, self-care, and stress management are truly foundational and not just adjuncts. The AUA recommends education on normal bladder function, the limits of current knowledge, and the likelihood of needing multiple trials; it also advises implementing self-care and behavioral modifications and encouraging stress management to mitigate flares, which aligns with RCOG's emphasis on chronic pain principles and EAU's support for multimodal behavioral approaches [^116E5r1N] [^115TMSpw] [^111wBy3U] [^111vgrDe] [^113xfDqE] [^117YFf7H].

> Next, I should review oral pharmacologic options. Let me think about which agents have the most consistent, albeit modest, signals. Amitriptyline is commonly recommended and can be considered after conservative measures, with careful attention to anticholinergic effects. Cimetidine has some supportive data but should be initiated by specialists given off-label status. Hydroxyzine has limited evidence. Pentosan polysulfate remains an option, but I need to ensure we counsel on the risk of pigmentary maculopathy with chronic use and reassess benefit-risk regularly. Importantly, the Cochrane NMA suggests very low certainty for many oral agents, so I should avoid overstating efficacy and frame these as trials with explicit stop criteria [^112VQMqU] [^11691tCV] [^114795AC] [^114aXWJH] [^11751eoz].

> Hold on, I should verify intravesical therapies and their place in the sequence. DMSO remains the only FDA-approved intravesical for IC/BPS and can be considered after oral/conservative failure, often in combination with heparin to prolong benefit. Lidocaine instillations can help acute flares. Hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfate have supportive but heterogeneous evidence and are reasonable in selected patients. I should double-check that these are framed as options with variable certainty and potential for benefit in subsets [^114uZm2E] [^115RZsFe] [^112rr2Uf] [^11473BTN].

> But wait, what if the patient has Hunner lesions? I need to ensure I do not conflate this phenotype with nonulcer disease. For Hunner lesions, cystoscopic-guided fulguration or steroid injection is appropriate and may be repeated as needed, and this is one of the few scenarios where an early procedural approach is justified; I should confirm that this remains a guideline-supported strategy [^111BgzEB] [^115pZCDK].

> Next, I should review neuromodulation. Sacral and pudendal neuromodulation can be considered for refractory cases, ideally in centers with expertise, and I need to check that expectations are set about staged trials and variable response. This fits within a multimodal algorithm after less invasive options have been exhausted [^11473BTN].

> I will now examine surgical options. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — surgery is last-resort and should be reserved for intractable, disabling symptoms despite comprehensive multimodal therapy. Options include submucosal or trigonal injection, augmentation cystoplasty, and diversion with or without cystectomy; I should confirm that patients are counseled on irreversibility and potential complications, and that these are typically tertiary-care decisions [^117BQrMA].

> Let me consider pain management explicitly. I need to ensure we apply chronic pain principles, prioritize non-opioid strategies, and integrate psychological therapies. Multimodal pain management with NSAIDs, acetaminophen, and selected neuromodulators is reasonable; CBT and related behavioral therapies have growing evidence and should be offered, particularly for patients with central sensitization features; if opioids are considered at all, it should be rare, time-limited, and tightly monitored, with clear exit strategies [^116gLTm7] [^116C2fyG] [^1131yTSu] [^112CK8ba].

> I should confirm the role of multidisciplinary care. For refractory cases or complex comorbid pain syndromes, referral to a chronic pelvic pain program with urology, pain medicine, physical therapy, psychology, and gynecology or colorectal input is advised. Phenotype-directed strategies such as UPOINT can help align therapies to dominant drivers, and I need to remember that widespread pain phenotypes may predict better response to centrally acting treatments rather than purely bladder-targeted therapies [^1116HYLX] [^112uk87m] [^1117SAC8] [^113SYG2B].

> Next, I should review an operational algorithm and double-check that it aligns with guideline sequencing. Start with education, self-care, stress management, and bladder training. Layer oral agents one at a time with predefined stop rules. Consider intravesical therapies after oral failure. Address Hunner lesions procedurally when present. Escalate to neuromodulation and, rarely, surgery for intractable disease. Throughout, reassess every 3–6 months and discontinue ineffective treatments to reduce burden and risk [^116V3Frr] [^114tALFt] [^117BQrMA].

> Hold on, I should verify what to avoid. Long-term systemic antibiotics lack efficacy and should not be offered. BCG should not be offered outside trials. High-pressure, long-duration hydrodistension should be avoided. Chronic systemic glucocorticoids should not be used. These are explicitly discouraged in contemporary guidance and should be reinforced during counseling [^117QJUvY] [^1164VZjo].

> Let me reconsider areas of uncertainty and evidence quality. Most IC/BPS trials are small, heterogeneous, and short-term, so I need to communicate that many recommendations are Options or Clinical Principles rather than Standards. Nonetheless, combining modalities is reasonable and may outperform monotherapy in real-world care, and emerging biomarker and phenotype work may soon enable more precise matching of therapies to patient biology [^115bBo7N] [^114NWd3F] [^116gnYnN] [^113oH2Nn].

> Finally, I should double-check that patient-centered elements are explicit: shared decision-making, expectation setting about partial rather than complete remission, and a plan for flares are essential. Patients often prefer guided self-care and virtual supports, and documenting baseline symptoms allows objective reassessment of response and timely de-escalation of ineffective therapies [^112Fq4ED] [^112FvnvS] [^111P8v53] [^114bQMuj].

---

The best management for chronic interstitial cystitis is a **stepwise, multimodal approach** that begins with conservative measures (education, diet, stress management, pelvic floor therapy) [^116E5r1N] [^1127hq1p] [^112GCsXd] [^114uZm2E], then adds oral agents (amitriptyline, pentosan polysulfate, cimetidine, hydroxyzine) [^112VQMqU] [^112wHFW6] [^113SVhjt] and intravesical therapies (DMSO, heparin, lidocaine) [^114uZm2E] if needed. For refractory cases, consider neuromodulation or Botox; reserve surgery for severe, treatment-resistant disease [^11473BTN] [^116pXjUZ]. Management should be **individualized**, with shared decision-making and regular reassessment to stop ineffective therapies and adjust the plan as needed [^112Fq4ED] [^114tALFt].

---

## Conservative and behavioral therapies

Conservative and behavioral therapies are **first-line** because they are safe and can meaningfully reduce symptoms [^111BgzEB].

- **Patient education**: Explain normal bladder function, the chronic nature of IC/BPS, and the need for multiple trials to find effective therapy [^116E5r1N] [^115E6qa4].

- **Dietary modifications**: Identify and avoid triggers (e.g. caffeine, alcohol, acidic foods) [^1127hq1p].

- **Stress management**: Use mindfulness, relaxation, and CBT to reduce flares [^111vgrDe] [^1131yTSu].

- **Pelvic floor physical therapy**: Address hypertonic pelvic floor dysfunction and pain [^11473BTN].

---

## Pharmacologic therapies

Pharmacologic therapy is added when conservative measures are insufficient; **no single agent works for all**, so trials should be sequential and individualized [^111BgzEB] [^116E5r1N].

| **Medication class** | **Examples** | **Mechanism of action** | **Clinical evidence** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Tricyclic antidepressants | Amitriptyline | - Analgesic <br/> - Anticholinergic <br/> - Mast cell stabilization | Moderate evidence; reduces pain and frequency [^notfound] |
| Antihistamines | Hydroxyzine | Mast cell stabilization | Limited evidence; may help subtypes [^notfound] |
| H2 antagonists | Cimetidine | - Mast cell stabilization <br/> - Anti-inflammatory | Limited evidence; consider specialist use [^11691tCV] |
| Glycosaminoglycan therapy | Pentosan polysulfate | - Bladder lining repair <br/> - Anti-inflammatory | Moderate evidence; AUA/EAU recommended [^112wHFW6] [^11211WTA] |

---

## Intravesical therapies

Intravesical therapies are **second-line** for patients who do not respond to oral therapy [^notfound].

- **Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)**: Anti-inflammatory and analgesic; FDA-approved for IC/BPS [^114uZm2E].

- **Heparin**: GAG layer restoration; often combined with alkalinized lidocaine for flares [^notfound].

- **Lidocaine**: Short-term pain relief during flares [^notfound].

---

## Advanced and minimally invasive procedures

Advanced procedures are reserved for **refractory cases** after conservative and pharmacologic therapies fail [^116V3Frr].

- **Botulinum toxin injections**: Reduce pain and frequency; repeat as needed [^notfound].

- **Neuromodulation**: Sacral or pudendal neuromodulation for refractory symptoms [^11473BTN].

- **Hydrodistension**: Diagnostic and therapeutic; avoid high-pressure/long-duration [^11473BTN] [^117QJUvY].

---

## Surgical interventions

Surgery is **last-resort** for severe, refractory disease [^116pXjUZ].

- **Submucosal injection**: Triamcinolone for Hunner lesions [^115pZCDK].

- **Augmentation cystoplasty**: For end-stage, refractory bladders [^notfound].

- **Urinary diversion**: For debilitating symptoms unresponsive to all other therapies [^notfound].

---

## Multidisciplinary and individualized care

Multidisciplinary care coordinates urology, pain management, psychology, and physical therapy to address the complex, chronic pain syndrome of IC/BPS [^112CK8ba] [^113xfDqE]. Individualized care tailors therapy to symptom phenotype, comorbidities, and patient preferences through shared decision-making [^112Fq4ED] [^1117SAC8].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular follow-up should track symptoms, quality of life, and treatment response, with ineffective therapies discontinued to minimize burden and side effects [^114tALFt] [^113PvaDX]. If multiple approaches fail, **reconsider the diagnosis** or look for alternative etiologies [^113sFbae] [^1173zHYL].

---

A **stepwise, multimodal approach** — conservative measures first, then pharmacologic and intravesical therapies, and advanced procedures or surgery only if needed — yields the best outcomes. Individualized, multidisciplinary care with regular reassessment is essential to optimize symptom control and quality of life [^116V3Frr].

A strength of our study is the quality of the trial data collected as part of well-designed and carefully conducted clinical trials, with rigorous data quality procedures and limited missing data. Details of these studies are available in the original publications. The original RCTs did not collect data on other participant-related variables suggested as potentially important in defining different etiologies underlying pain maintenance, so we could not test other chronic pain phenotypes. For example, conducting future studies using sensory testing methods and patient reports of specific pain symptoms might help differentiate underlying processes that may maintain widespread painand affect study results. In future trials, including some of these measures may improve our understanding of the treatment efficacy detected in clinical trials.

This article provides an overview of 2 conditions that defy straightforward characterization and treatment: interstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome often coexists with high tone pelvic floor dysfunction. These conditions are common in gynecologic patients who present with chronic pelvic pain and are often misdiagnosed due to their syndromic nature and amorphous definitions. Clinicians should maintain a high level of suspicion for these processes in patients with chronic pelvic pain or recurrent urinary tract infection symptoms. Optimal treatment uses a multimodal approach to alleviate symptoms.

4.3 Recommendations and Conclusion

Current evidence on acupuncture for IC/BPS is limited in both quality and quantity, with many studies compromised by bias risks. Challenges include small sample sizes, difficulties with double‐blind designs, lack of appropriate placebo controls, and reliance on animal models. Future research should focus on standardized sham controls, unified diagnostic approaches, and a deeper understanding of IC/BPS's etiopathogenesis to improve study quality and simplify evidence evaluation.

This review highlights acupuncture's frequent use in multimodal treatments for IC/BPS. While this complicates isolating its specific effects, it aligns with TCM, which views acupuncture as part of a holistic system aimed at restoring balance between physical, mental, and emotional health, particularly relevant for the multifactorial nature of IC/BPS.

Further investigation is needed, as most studies report positive results in symptom relief and safety, with mild adverse effects. However, documentation of these effects is limited, and many studies acknowledge methodological weaknesses. To establish acupuncture's efficacy and safety, more high‐quality experimental research with standardized protocols is required. Additionally, qualitative data on participants' beliefs and experiences should be prioritized, and exploring public perceptions could provide valuable insights into acupuncture's effectiveness, given the role of subjective experiences in treatment evaluation.

### Phenotype-directed management of interstitial cystitis / bladder pain syndrome [^112uk87m]. Urology (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess a flexible therapeutic strategy for patients referred to a specialized interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) clinic using an individualized phenotype-directed treatment plan based on clinically based urinary, psychosocial, organ-specific, infection, neurologic or nonbladder, and tenderness of pelvic floor (UPOINT) categorization, instead of the traditional algorithmic stepwise approach.

Methods

Consecutive patients referred to a specialized tertiary IC/BPS clinic with at least 1 follow-up posttreatment visit were categorized according to their UPOINT status and treated according to previously published individualized phenotype-based treatment plan. Patients were assessed at baseline and up to 2 years with validated symptom scores (interstitial cystitis symptom score [ICSI]; and pain urgency frequency questionnaire) as well as pain and voiding assessments.

Results

Follow-up visit data were available for 93 patients (mean age, 45.2 years; median age, 44 years; mean ICSI, 13.2 ± 3.6). Patients reported a median of 4 UPOINT domains (mean, 3.7 ± 0.94) with the following distribution: U = 100%; P = 31.2%; O = 97.8%; I = 45.2%; N = 39.8%; and T = 55.9%. The mean decrease in ICSI was 3.4 points. Significant clinical improvement (> 30% decrease in ICSI) was observed in 46.2% compared with initial baseline visit. Pain urgency frequency, and pain and urgency scoring changes were comparable. No correlation between severity of symptoms and number of domains and ICSI decrease was observed.

Conclusion

Almost 50% of patients referred to a tertiary IC/BPS clinic, regardless of the complexity or severity of condition, experienced clinically significant improvement using an individualized phenotype-directed therapeutic approach.

### Diagnosis and treatment of interstitial cystitis / bladder pain syndrome [^117BQrMA]. The Journal of Urology (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

This guideline provides direction to clinicians and patients regarding how to recognize interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS), conduct a valid diagnostic process, and approach treatment with the goals of maximizing symptom control and patient quality of life while minimizing adverse events and patient burden.

Methods

An initial systematic review of the literature using the MEDLINE® database (search dates 1/1/83–7/22/09) was conducted to identify peer-reviewed publications relevant to the diagnosis and treatment of IC/BPS. The review yielded an evidence base of 86 treatment articles after application of inclusion/exclusion criteria. In July 2013, the Guideline underwent an Update Literature Review, a process in which an additional literature search is conducted and a systematic review is produced in order to maintain guideline currency with newly published literature. The 2013 review identified an additional 31 articles relevant to treatment. An Update Literature Review in 2022 (search dates: 06/2013–01/2021) identified 63 studies, 53 of which were added to the evidence base.

Results

In contrast to the prior versions, the 2022 updated Guideline no longer divides treatments into first-line through sixth-line tiers. Instead, treatment is categorized into behavioral/non-pharmacologic, oral medicines, bladder instillations, procedures, and major surgery. This approach reinforces that the clinical approach for IC/BPS needs to be individualized and based on the unique characteristics of each patient. In addition, new statements were written to provide guidance on cystoscopy for patients with Hunner lesions, shared decision-making, and potential adverse events from pentosan polysulfate. The supporting text on major surgery also has been completely revised.

Conclusion

IC/BPS is a heterogeneous clinical syndrome. Even though patients present with similar symptoms of bladder/pelvic pain and pressure/discomfort associated with urinary frequency and strong urge to urinate, there are subgroups or phenotypes within IC/BPS. Except for patients with Hunner lesions, initial treatment should typically be nonsurgical. Concurrent, multi-modal therapies may be offered.

5. Conclusions

The present study strongly supports the importance of the baseline identification of patient pain phenotypes in designing clinical trials for pain-based disorders with targeted treatment selection. The extent of pain beyond the primary pelvic site substantially affected the outcomes in 2 of 3 previously published RCTs for IC/BPS. The data suggest that treatments focused on urinary and pelvic pain symptoms are more likely to demonstrate benefit in patients where local symptoms predominate. By contrast, patients with more widespread pain may require centrally directed treatments intended for more generalized pain. The MAPP Research Network explored the use of body mapsand pressure-based QST, and the analysis in this analysis used a simpler 5-question survey as the others were not available. Although a more specific measure of widespread and other pain characteristics may improve clinical trial designs, our findings suggest the importance of additional research to identify the most efficient and sufficient methods of measuring characteristics that define the widespread pain phenotype. Measurable phenotypes should be included in the design of future clinical trials to ensure the validity of evidence-based symptomatic therapy studies and enhance the evidence's applicability to clinical care.

### Recent developments in the management of interstitial cystitis [^116pXjUZ]. Current Opinion in Urology (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Interstitial cystitis, a great enigma of urology today, is a chronic sterile inflammatory disease of the bladder of unknown etiology characterized by urinary frequency, urgency, nocturia and suprapubic pain. Although there are plenty of theories, the etiology of the condition remains obscure. This review focuses on recently published literature on interstitial cystitis.

Recent Findings

Several pathophysiological mechanisms have been proposed in the past few years including epithelial dysfunction, activation of mast cells, neurogenic inflammation, autoimmunity and occult infection. Evidence indicates that it is a heterogeneous syndrome and that the two subtypes, classic and nonulcer disease, represent different entities. The diagnosis is made by clinical and cystoscopic evaluation with hydrodistension and often with biopsy when other disorders are excluded. The National Institute of Arthritis, Diabetes, Digestive and Kidney Diseases has developed criteria for clinical studies. There is a need for a noninvasive marker of interstitial cystitis. Antiproliferative factor as a urinary marker has shown promising results. The value of the bladder permeability test in interstitial cystitis needs further investigation. Many gynecologic conditions mimic the symptoms of interstitial cystitis. Multiple forms of therapy are available including self-care and dietary changes, medical and intravesical treatments, neuromodulation, multimodality treatment and surgical intervention. It is recommended that the most conservative treatments are used first and surgery should be regarded as the last resort.

Summary

Interstitial cystitis is a challenging disease of urology today. While causative factors remain unknown, treatment is based on empiricism. Intensive research may result in new and hopefully more effective treatments in the future.

### Widespread pain phenotypes impact treatment efficacy results in randomized clinical trials for interstitial cystitis / bladder pain syndrome: a multidisciplinary approach to the study of chronic pelvic pain network study [^115S1c8G]. Pain (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Pain clinical trials are notoriously complex and often inefficient in demonstrating efficacy, even for known efficacious treatments. A major issue is the difficulty in the a priori identification of specific phenotypes to include in the study population. Recent work has identified the extent of widespread pain as an important determinant of the likelihood of response to therapy, but it has not been tested in clinical trials for the treatment of interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS). We explored this hypothesis using data from 3 previously published trials testing treatments for IC/BPS, which suggested modest benefits but did not meet a priori primary outcome statistical significance criteria. Importantly, these studies also collected symptom questionnaire data that allowed us to retrospectively identify participants with and without widespread pain. Analyzing the treatment by the degree of widespread pain revealed a difference in outcome and statistical significance level for each trial. Participants with predominately local pain (ie, limited widespread pain symptoms) responded to therapy targeting local symptoms, whereas those with widespread pain did not. Alternatively, participants with widespread pain beyond their local pelvic pain responded to more centrally acting treatments. Our results suggest that differentiating patients based on widespread vs more localized pain is a key consideration for designing future clinical trials for conditions with variable pain profiles, such as IC/BPS and potentially other pain-based syndromic disorders.

### Current updates relating to treatment for interstitial cystitis / bladder pain syndrome: systematic review and network meta-analysis [^1178LjLp]. BMC Urology (2024). Medium credibility.

In the course of development, nerve growth factor (NGF) is a key requisite for sensory and sympathetic nerve cell survival. It has also been determined that NGF is a peripheral mediator in a number of inflammatory disorders associated with pain. As a humanized monoclonal antibody against NGF, tanezumab has a high affinity and specificity for bonding with NGF, thus blocking the mediator from engaging with nociceptive nerve cell receptors. The latter comprises the high- and low-affinity receptors, tropomyosin-related kinase A and p75. Following the use of tanezumab, a clinical trial reported an improvement in pain scores as well as enhanced function and overall evaluation outcomes in individuals with chronic painful disorders, not including IC. The initial effectiveness of pain relief following pain therapy in IC was documented by Evans et al. but these data were too ambiguous to be incorporated within the current meta-analysis or NMA.

Fulranumab is a human recombinant monoclonal antibody and a powerful human NGF inhibitor. A positive dose effect has been demonstrated in painful disorders, including the neuropathy associated with diabetes. Additionally, mixed data regarding its efficacy in comparison with a placebo have been presented. In patients with osteoarthritic symptoms, fulranumab demonstrated greater efficacy than an opiate, although, in low back pain, no benefit over a placebo was seen. A study by Wang et al. failed to show any positive effects from one dose, but the sample size was restricted and the study had insufficient statistical power. The clinical observations from these studies suggest that it would be valuable to carry out a clinical study in larger or more selected populations to establish whether fulranumab would be effective as a treatment for the refractory pain experienced by patients with IC. Additional possible treatment strategies include options from complementary and alternative medicine. These include behavioural and physical therapies approaches to ameliorate stress and modification of the diet. In patients who were symptomatic with IC, an intense and systematic alteration of the diet was associated with symptom relief within three months; this benefit continued for a minimum of 12 months.

There are several limitations associated with this study. Firstly, despite the numerous studies encompassed, there is a surplus of specific therapeutic strategies and the study populations for the individual approaches are small. Secondly, the only first-line therapy evaluated was diet modification. AUA guidelines suggest that patient education, patient self-efficacy, behavioural changes and stress reduction should be first-line therapies in individuals with IC. Finally, the large number of therapeutic possibilities evaluated precluded their concurrent analysis in the NMA.

Regarding medical management for interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome, more specifically with respect to pharmacotherapy, RCOG 2017 guidelines recommend to consider offering oral amitriptyline or cimetidine for the treatment of patients with IC/BPS, if first-line conservative treatments have failed. Consider initiating cimetidine only by a clinician specialized in treating BPS, as it is not licensed to treat this condition.

### Diagnosis and treatment of interstitial cystitis / bladder pain syndrome [^116C2fyG]. The Journal of Urology (2022). High credibility.

Interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) pharmacologic pain management — overall approach: The goal of pharmacotherapy is to find medication/medications that provide significant pain relief with minimal side effects. Pain management tools include urinary analgesics, NSAIDs, narcotics, and a wide variety of nonnarcotic medications used for chronic pain which have been "borrowed" from the treatment of depression, epilepsy, arrhythmias, etc. Given the current state of knowledge, pharmacological pain management principles for IC/BPS should be similar to those for management of other chronic pain states, and non-opioids alternatives to manage pain should be used preferentially. In addition, effective treatment of symptom flares may require a pain treatment protocol with some flexibility to manage flare-related breakthrough pain. Due to the global opioid crisis, the judicious use of chronic opioids is advised and only after informed decision-making with the patients and with periodic follow-ups to assess efficacy, adverse side effects, compliance, and potential of abuse or misuse.

Interstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome (IC/PBS) is a chronic bladder disorder characterized by pelvic pain and irritative voiding symptoms. The symptoms of IC/PBS can overlap with such conditions as endometriosis, recurrent urinary tract infection, chronic pelvic pain, overactive bladder, and vulvodynia. The etiology of IC/PBS is likely multifactorial and may involve a defective urothelium, neurogenic upregulation, and mast cell activation. A thorough patient history and physical examination are critical in the differential diagnosis of IC/PBS. Frequent follow-up and patient education are important components of treatment once a condition is diagnosed. A multimodal approach to therapy can provide optimal relief for patients with IC/PBS.

### Diagnosis and treatment of interstitial cystitis / bladder pain syndrome [^112YSyTY]. The Journal of Urology (2022). High credibility.

Interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) pain management — analgesic selection and titration: It is important that the patient understand that finding the medication or combination of medications that provide effective pain control requires a "trial and error" method of prescribing. The efficacy of each analgesic administered should be determined and only one drug should be titrated at a time; otherwise it is not possible to assess the effects of a certain drug on pain scores. The starting dose should always be the smallest available and titration should occur at frequent intervals, guided by pain scores and side effects, and this requires frequent contact between the patient and the clinician. It is important for the patient and the prescribing clinician to understand that some side effects actually improve as the patient continues to take the drug for several weeks, and if these side effects are not intolerable, then the patient should be guided through this period. Patients and clinicians should be aware that 100% pain relief is often not achievable; the focus of pain management is to minimize discomfort and maximize the patient's ability to function in daily life.

### Pathophysiology and potential multimodal therapeutic strategies for IC / BPS [^112icKp6]. Nature Reviews: Urology (2025). High credibility.

Interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) is a bladder disorder with no definite aetiology and currently no effective treatment. Its clinical symptoms vary widely, and the bladder condition and extra-bladder dysfunction also show different clinical presentations. This condition is considered to have multiple factors affecting the bladder and clinical symptoms, including urothelial dysfunction, mast cell activation, autoimmune response, neurogenic inflammation, viral or bacterial infection, autonomic nervous dysfunction and central nervous sensitization. Several non-pharmacological, medical, intravesical and novel bladder therapies have been advocated, but the efficacy and durability of these treatments have not been well elucidated. Multimodal therapy has been suggested based on possible pathological mechanisms; however, the most appropriate therapeutic strategy for this disorder has not been well defined. Thus, a rational algorithm for concomitant multimodal therapy for IC/BPS has been proposed.

### Diagnostic criteria for… [^114uZm2E]. AAFP (2001). Low credibility.

ORAL TREATMENTS First-line oral treatments for interstitial cystitis include tricyclic antidepressants, antihistamines and pentosan polysulfate. No placebo-controlled studies with tricyclic antidepressants have been performed, but these medications have been found to be beneficial in several open-label studies. |Physical therapy‡| Pentosan polysulfate is the only oral therapy for the treatment of interstitial cystitis symptoms that has been studied in placebo-controlled trials. 9, 25, 27, 28 Pentosan polysulfate is a highly sulfated, semisynthetic glucosaminoglycan with chemical and structural similarities to naturally occurring glucosaminoglycans. The medication is well tolerated and has a favorable side effect profile. In one study, bladder pain was relieved by at least 50 percent in 38 percent of patients taking pentosan polysulfate compared with 18 percent improvement in patients treated with placebo.
29.

11 The most commonly used and only intravesical agent labeled by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of interstitial cystitis is dimethyl sulfoxide. A controlled study of patients with interstitial cystitis showed that dimethyl sulfoxide was superior to placebo, with 53 percent of patients in the treatment group having significant improvement of symptoms. 30 Although dimethyl sulfoxide is an anti-inflammatory agent, it seems to have some analgesic and muscle relaxant properties as well. In an open-label study, 56 percent of patients with interstitial cystitis experienced relief from symptoms using heparin intravesically, in a dosage of 10, 000 U three times a week. 31 In another study, monthly heparin instillation prolonged the response to dimethyl sulfoxide. 32 Instillation of hyaluronic acid, in a dosage of 40 mg weekly, provided complete symptom relief in 25 percent of patients and partial relief in 46 percent.
33.

ADJUVANT TREATMENTS Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation resulted in improvement or remission in 54 percent of patients with classic interstitial cystitis and in 26 percent of patients with nonulcer interstitial cystitis. 35 Many patients with interstitial cystitis have spasms of the pelvic floor muscles that contribute to symptoms of pelvic pain, urgency and frequency. Physical therapy with biofeedback for pelvic floor relaxation may be helpful in such patients.

### Interstitial cystitis / painful bladder syndrome: appropriate diagnosis and management [^113Xap69]. Journal of Women's Health (2007). Low credibility.

Interstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome (IC/PBS) is characterized by urinary frequency, urgency, and pelvic pain in the absence of any other identifiable pathology. Initial identification of IC/PBS is challenging, as patients may have a range of symptoms that overlap with other disorders, including urinary tract infection (UTI). These patients may be treated empirically with antibiotics; however, many patients with such symptoms are actually culture negative and are later diagnosed with IC/PBS. This review describes the importance of recognizing the symptom overlap between IC/PBS and UTI and focuses on approaches to the diagnosis and management of IC/PBS. Physicians can improve patient care by considering IC/PBS early in the differential diagnosis.

### What is new in bladder pain syndrome / interstitial cystitis? [^117NF36W]. Current Opinion in Urology (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Bladder pain syndrome/interstitial cystitis is an important and poorly understood disorder. This review highlights current research findings that may be of benefit to the clinician who is responsible for the diagnosis and treatment of patients who suffer from this condition.

Recent Findings

The perspective from which we view bladder pain syndrome/interstitial cystitis is evolving, as is apparent in the literature this year. It is best perceived as one of many chronic pain syndromes, some of which may be related. International efforts aimed at consistent definition and nomenclature are ongoing. Some new treatments have been reported that may be of benefit.

Summary

In the age of the internet, it is incumbent upon the clinician to keep up with current ideas, epidemiology, and treatment findings to be able to discuss these with well informed patients who come to clinics around the world. In this review we hope to bring practicing healthcare providers up to date with the literature on bladder pain syndrome/interstitial cystitis, and the implications for their patients.

Management approach — The published literature regarding the typical course of interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) is conflicting, with some studies suggesting that IC/BPS is a chronic condition with a waxing and waning course with, on average, little improvement over time while other studies suggest that most patients seem to improve over time. It is clear, however, that there is a limited understanding of IC/BPS pathophysiology and that most treatments are targeted at symptom control.

### Current updates relating to treatment for interstitial cystitis / bladder pain syndrome: systematic review and network meta-analysis [^115LDNBu]. BMC Urology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

A constellation of incapacitating systems, which encompass discomfort in the suprapubic region, nocturia and micturition frequency and urgency, are characteristic of interstitial cystitis (IC), a condition also referred to as bladder pain syndrome (BPS). Typically, such symptoms occur when the bladder is full, and dissipate once urine has been passed. In addition to these symptoms, a major complaint of patients suffering from IC is pelvic pain, which originates from the urethra, vagina or rectum, amongst other viscera. There is at present no standard definition for this condition, nor consensus regarding its management, recommended therapy or the treatment period required.

A range of drugs directed towards the treatment of IC have been the topic of recent debate, although the largest percentage of patients cured of the condition remains in the region of 60%. It has been demonstrated that numerous factors are involved in the pathogenesis of IC. These include autoimmune phenomena, injury to the urothelial glycosaminoglycan layer, neurological discomfort and inflammatory processes.

Despite the publication of several meta-analyses as well as a network meta-analysis (NMA), these have not provided a comprehensive review of therapeutic strategies. The lack of clarity regarding the efficacy of certain therapies in helping individuals with IC, owing to the low or very low degrees of supportive evidence, was expressed in a recent Cochrane review. Although the results of numerous studies can be accessed, the majority only included small populations and so the outcomes of therapy could not be accurately evaluated. The same issue applied to a further NMA, and so the results were not apposite for the current work. Thus, studies with higher sample numbers and which are specifically targeted towards this condition are required to enhance the present quality of evidence. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have been added by the current authors to the literature, and they have concurrently carried out a traditional pairwise meta-analysis and an NMA to offer more evidence-based conclusions.

There are numerous types of therapy available for IC, some of which are extremely complicated, and so as well as carrying out an NMA, a general meta-analysis by effect variables has also been performed. Additionally, meta-regression analysis was applied to ascertain the moderator effect. The study is underpinned by the hypothesis that a high level of therapeutic success can be achieved in patients with IC using a combination of approaches; this theory could subsequently be tested in RCTs.

### AUA guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of interstitial cystitis / bladder pain syndrome [^1126bonT]. The Journal of Urology (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose

To provide a clinical framework for the diagnosis and treatment of interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome.

Materials and Methods

A systematic review of the literature using the MEDLINE® database (search dates 1/1/83–7/22/09) was conducted to identify peer reviewed publications relevant to the diagnosis and treatment of interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome. Insufficient evidence-based data were retrieved regarding diagnosis and, therefore, this portion of the Guideline is based on Clinical Principles and Expert Opinion statements. The review yielded an evidence base of 86 treatment articles after application of inclusion/exclusion criteria. These publications were used to create the majority of the treatment portion of the Guideline. When sufficient evidence existed, the body of evidence for a particular treatment was assigned a strength rating of A (high), B (moderate) or C (low). Additional treatment information is provided as Clinical Principles and Expert Opinion when insufficient evidence existed. See text and algorithm for definitions, and detailed diagnostic management, and treatment frameworks.

Results

The evidence-based guideline statements are provided for diagnosis and overall management of interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome as well as for various treatments. The panel identified first through sixth line treatments as well as developed guideline statements on treatments that should not be offered.

Conclusions

Interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome is best identified and managed through use of a logical algorithm such as is presented in this Guideline. In the algorithm the panel identifies an overall management strategy for the interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome patient. Diagnosis and treatment methodologies can be expected to change as the evidence base grows in the future.

The urologic chronic pain conditions such as chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome and interstitial cystitis are syndromes whose evaluation and management are controversial. Part of the difficulty in diagnosis and therapy is the heterogeneity of etiologies and symptoms. We propose a six-domain phenotype, which can classify these patients clinically and can direct the selection of therapy in the most evidence based multimodal manner. The domains are urinary, psychosocial, organ specific, infection, neurologic and tenderness of skeletal muscles. This system is flexible and responsive to new biomarkers and therapies as their utility and efficacy are proven.

Conclusions

In patients with IC, therapy is not straightforward. The current work has led to the recognition of a therapeutic combination for this condition that could be anticipated to have a positive clinical outcome. It was established that ongoing therapy is of value, and that the efficacy of treatments is diminished in individuals of advancing years. Additional RCTs are required to ascertain the efficacy of combined therapeutic approaches, such as immunomodulatory compounds, intravesical injection or instillation with BTX or HA, or HA and CS and diet modification.

### Fulranumab in patients with interstitial cystitis / bladder pain syndrome: observations from a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study [^111fkZe6]. BMC Urology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Pain (suprapubic related to bladder filling, pelvic, and/or in extragenital locations such as the lower abdomen/back) is the hallmark symptom of interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS). Several lines of evidence suggest that IC/BPS can be conceptualized as a bladder pain syndrome associated with not only chronic pain, but also voiding-related symptoms and, in many, other chronic systemic pain disorders. As such, pain management is central to multimodal therapeutic strategies for IC/BPS, given its bearing on psychosocial functioning and quality of life. In fact, recently published IC/BPS guidelines from the American Urological Association recommend pain management as first-line treatment, which should be offered to all patients. Despite the need of IC/BPS patients for analgesia, effective pharmacological treatment for their chronic pain remains elusive.

### Pulsed electromagnetic field (PEMF) as an adjunct therapy for pain management in interstitial cystitis / bladder pain syndrome [^112GyxgH]. International Urogynecology Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction and Hypothesis

Patients with interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) often experience chronic pelvic and even systemic pain that can be difficult to clinically manage. Pulsed electromagnetic field (PEMF) therapy, a non-invasive strategy that has shown significant efficacy for pain reduction in other chronic pain conditions, may provide benefit for pain management in patients with IC/BPS.

Methods

PEMF delivery to patients occurs via a bio-electromagnetic-energy device which consists of a flexible mat (180×50 cm) that the patient lies on for systemic, full-body delivery and/or a flexible pad (50×15 cm) for targeted delivery to a specific body region (e.g., pelvic area). The duration of individual sessions, number of sessions per day, total number of sessions, and follow-up observation period vary between previously published studies. Positive outcomes are typically reported as a significant reduction in visual analog scale (VAS) pain score and functional improvement assessed using validated questionnaires specific to the condition under study.

Results and Conclusions

The use of PEMF has been evaluated as a therapeutic strategy for pain management in several clinical scenarios. Randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trials have reported positive efficacy and safety profiles when PEMF was used to treat non-specific low back pain, patellofemoral pain syndrome, chronic post-operative pain, osteoarthritis-related pain, rheumatoid arthritis-related pain, and fibromyalgia-related pain. Based on these positive outcomes in a variety of pain conditions, clinical trials to evaluate whether PEMF can provide a safe, non-invasive therapeutic approach to improve symptoms of chronic pain and fatigue in patients with IC/BPS are warranted.

Management approach for interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) — treatment decisions should be made after shared decision-making, with the patient informed of the risks, potential benefits, and alternatives, and except for patients with Hunner lesions, initial treatment should typically be nonsurgical (Expert Opinion). Efficacy of treatment should be periodically reassessed, and ineffective treatments should be stopped (Clinical Principle). Multimodal pain management approaches should be initiated, pain management should be continually assessed for effectiveness, and if inadequate, consideration should be given to a multidisciplinary approach and the patient referred appropriately (Clinical Principle).

### Interventions for treating people with symptoms of bladder pain syndrome: a network meta-analysis [^11751eoz]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Bladder pain syndrome (BPS), which includes the condition of interstitial cystitis, is a poorly understood clinical condition for which patients present with varying symptoms. Management of BPS is challenging for both patients and practitioners. At present, there is no universally accepted diagnosis and diverse causes have been proposed. This is reflected in wide-ranging treatment options, used alone or in combination, with limited evidence. A network meta-analysis (NMA) simultaneously comparing multiple treatments may help to determine the best treatment options for patients with BPS.

Objectives

To conduct a network meta-analysis to assess the effects of interventions for treating people with symptoms of bladder pain syndrome (BPS).

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Specialised Register, which contains trials identified from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, in the Cochrane Library), MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process, MEDLINE Epub Ahead of Print, ClinicalTrials.gov, the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) and handsearched journals and conference proceedings (searched 11 May 2018) and the reference lists of relevant articles. We conducted a further search on 5 June 2019, which yielded four small studies that were screened for eligibility but were not incorporated into the review.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs of interventions for treating adults with BPS. All types of interventions (including conservative, pharmacological and surgical) were eligible.

Data Collection and Analysis

We assessed the risk of bias of included studies using Cochrane's 'Risk of bias' tool. Primary outcomes were the number of people cured or improved, pain, frequency and nocturia. For each outcome, random-effects NMA models were fitted using WinBUGS 1.4. We monitored median odds ratios (ORs) for binary outcomes and mean differences (MDs) for continuous outcomes with 95% credible intervals (Crls). We compared results of the NMA with direct evidence from pairwise meta-analysis of head-to-head trials. We used the CINeMA tool to assess the certainty of evidence for selected treatment categories.

Main Results

We included 81 RCTs involving 4674 people with a median of 38 participants (range 10 to 369) per RCT. Most trials compared treatment against control; few trials compared two active treatments. There were 65 different active treatments, and some comparisons were informed by direct evidence from only one trial. To simplify, treatments were grouped into 31 treatment categories by mode of action. Most studies were judged to have unclear or high risk of bias for most domains, particularly for selection and detection bias. Overall, the NMA suggested that six (proportion cured/improved), one (pain), one (frequency) and zero (nocturia) treatment categories were effective compared with control, but there was great uncertainty around estimates of effect. Due to the large number of intervention comparisons in this review, we focus on three interventions: antidepressants, pentosan polysulfate (PPS) and neuromuscular blockade. We selected these interventions on the basis that they are given 'strong recommendations' in the EAU Guidelines for management of BPS (EAU Guidelines 2019). We found very low-certainty evidence suggesting that antidepressants were associated with greater likelihood of cure or improvement compared with control (OR 5.91, 95% CrI 1.12 to 37.56), but it was uncertain whether they reduced pain (MD -1.27, 95% CrI -3.25 to 0.71; low-certainty evidence), daytime frequency (MD -2.41, 95% CrI -6.85 to 2.05; very low-certainty evidence) or nocturia (MD 0.01, 95% CrI -2.53 to 2.50; very low-certainty evidence). There was no evidence that PPS had improved cure/improvement rates (OR 0.14, 95% CrI 0.40 to 3.35; very low-certainty evidence) or reduced pain (MD 0.42, 95% CrI -1.04 to 1.91; low-certainty evidence), frequency (MD -0.37, 95% CrI -5.00 to 3.44; very low-certainty evidence) or nocturia (MD -1.20, 95% CrI -3.62 to 1.28; very low-certainty evidence). There was evidence that neuromuscular blockade resulted in greater cure or improvement (OR 5.80, 95% CrI 2.08 to 18.30) but no evidence that it improved pain (MD -0.33, 95% CrI -1.71 to 1.03), frequency (MD -0.91, 95% CrI -3.24, 1.29) or nocturia (MD -0.04, 95% CrI -1.35 to 1.27). The certainty of this evidence was always very low.

Authors' Conclusions

We are uncertain whether some treatments may be effective in treating patients with BPS because the certainty of evidence was generally low or very low. Data were available for a relatively large number of trials, but most had small sample sizes and effects of treatments often could not be estimated with precision. An NMA was successfully conducted, but limited numbers of small trials for each treatment category hampered our ability to fully exploit the advantages of this analysis. Larger, more focused trials are needed to improve the current evidence base.

The study NMA objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of any drug treatments available for IC. Although the underlying causes of IC remain poorly defined, there are some data to suggest that in this condition, there is an aberrant immune response. Thus, controlling the intravesical immune response could be a potential therapeutic strategy.

Injection into the bladder was also categorized during this work. Out of a range of possible treatments, intravesical instillation or injection was shown to be an efficacious therapy in pairwise meta-analysis. Recommendations published by the American Urological Association (AUA) state that this procedure should be performed following the failure of first-line approaches and alongside oral treatments and physiotherapy.

Since IC is a chronic condition, therapy and monitoring should be carried out over the long term. Current therapeutic options may not offer a cure; however, in a number of patients, there may be spontaneous recovery, ultimately leading to complete relief from symptoms. An adverse prognostic factor for IC is age. Additionally, increased frequencies of diabetes mellitus, high blood pressure, kidney pathologies, coronary artery disease and raised serum lipids were identified. Psychological symptoms were also demonstrated to be more common in this cohort, with anxiety and depression recognized in 14–52% and 16–70% of patients with IC, respectively. Frequent monitoring and therapy were observed over the preceding five years in 76.3% of patients studied by Yeh et al. This group had a higher prevalence of chronic pathologies, which could impact the ongoing degree of IC. The majority of individuals who were under frequent review and who had been offered a range of therapies continued to present with bladder discomfort symptoms and were seeking novel therapeutic options. Those who no longer attended review appointments during the preceding five years had been less symptomatic following their early therapy. The current meta-regression analysis demonstrated that the more prolonged the follow-up period, the more likely frequency was to improve. Advancing years were associated with poorer clinical endpoints, e.g. nocturia; in general, each additional year of age was associated with a 3.4% deterioration in symptom score.

### Global consensus on interstitial cystitis / bladder pain syndrome: an update on therapeutic treatments [^11473BTN]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2025). Medium credibility.

Aims

Interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) is a chronic condition marked by chronic pain and voiding dysfunction, often without a clear cause. Management of which often requires a multidisciplinary approach, as well as multiple therapeutic interventions.

Methods

This review characterizes mechanisms and limitations of currently available treatment modalities for IC/BPS, as well as novel and investigational therapies.

Results

Conservative and supportive therapies include cognitive therapies, dietary and fluid management, pelvic floor exercises and bladder training. Additionally, pelvic floor directed therapies such as physical therapy, injections and nerve blocks should be considered. Cystoscopy with hydrodistension is both a diagnostic and therapeutic intervention. Currently available oral therapies include: pentosan polysulfate, amitriptyline, hydroxyzine, silodosin, and non-opioid medications such as cyclobenzaprine. Immunotherapies include cyclosporine and tacrolimus. Available intravesical therapies include dimethyl sulfoxide, lidocaine, oxybutynin, and glycosaminoglycan substitution treatment. Neuromodulation is also available including sacral and pudendal neuromodulation. Finally, we explore emerging therapies and drug delivery systems.

Conclusions

In this review, we present currently available treatment options for IC/BPS. These include conservative therapies, oral medications, intravesical therapies, and neuromodulation. Novel and investigational therapies are presented as well as promise for future directions.

### Towards precision medicine in clinical trials for the treatment of urologic chronic pelvic pain syndrome: lessons from the MAPP research network [^114wAmia]. Nature Reviews: Urology (2025). High credibility.

Randomized clinical trials have resulted in few approved therapies for the treatment of interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome and chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome, collectively referred to as urologic chronic pelvic pain syndrome. Heterogenous patient populations, mismatches of treatments to patient phenotypes, non-specific outcomes and use of standard study designs not leveraging phenotypic heterogeneity might have contributed to the inability of previous trials to demonstrate existing efficacy. The Multidisciplinary Approach to the Study of Chronic Pelvic Pain Research Network has identified important phenotypic characteristics associated with differential symptom severity and treatment responsiveness. Based on Multidisciplinary Approach to the Study of Chronic Pelvic Pain findings and external research, empirically informed strategies were generated for defining patient populations, specifying treatments and selecting primary outcomes for future randomized clinical trials in urologic chronic pelvic pain syndrome. Explicitly specifying the scope of eligibility criteria across heterogeneous patient subgroups defined by pain widespreadness, the presence of Hunner lesions, the presence of pain with bladder filling or relieved by voiding, the extent of chronic overlapping pain conditions, and pelvic floor tenderness is needed. Therapies should be selected based on the mechanism of action and relevance to the mechanism of pain and dominant symptomology that the patient experiences. Evidence suggests that pain and urinary symptoms should be evaluated separately. Promising trial designs for identifying effective therapies in this heterogeneous patient population include sequential multiple assignment randomized trials and adaptive designs.

### Current updates relating to treatment for interstitial cystitis / bladder pain syndrome: systematic review and network meta-analysis [^116YrH1B]. BMC Urology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Despite the publication of several meta-analyses regarding the efficacy of certain therapies in helping individuals with interstitial cystitis (IC) / bladder pain syndrome (BPS), these have not provided a comprehensive review of therapeutic strategies. The study aimed to determine the efficacy of various therapies for IC/BPS and identify potential moderating factors using randomized controlled trials (RCTs).

Methods

We queried the PubMed, Cochrane, and Embase databases to identify prospective RCTs using inclusion criteria: 1) patients diagnosed with IC, 2) interventions included relevant treatments, 3) comparisons were a specified control or placebo, 4) outcomes were mean differences for individual symptoms and structured questionnaires. The pairwise meta-analysis and network meta-analysis (NMA) were performed to compare the treatments used in IC/BPS. Hedges' g standardized mean differences (SMDs) were used for improvement in all outcomes using random-effects models. Efficacy outcomes included individual symptoms such as pain, frequency, urgency, and nocturia, as well as structured questionnaires measuring IC/BPS symptoms.

Results

A comprehensive literature search was conducted which identified 70 RCTs with 3,651 patients. The analysis revealed that certain treatments, such as instillation and intravesical injection, showed statistically significant improvements in pain and urgency compared to control or placebo groups in traditional pairwise meta-analysis. However, no specific treatment demonstrated significant improvement in all outcomes measured in the NMA. The results of moderator analyses to explore influential variables indicated that increasing age was associated with increased nocturia, while longer follow-up periods were associated with decreased frequency.

Conclusion

This systematic review and meta-analysis provide insights into the efficacy of various treatments for IC. Current research suggests that a combination of therapies may have a positive clinical outcome for patients with IC, despite the fact that treatment for this condition is not straightforward.

### Urologic chronic pelvic pain syndrome: insights from the MAPP research network [^114wnEEa]. Nature Reviews: Urology (2019). High credibility.

Urologic chronic pelvic pain syndrome (UCPPS), which encompasses interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome and chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome, is characterized by chronic pain in the pelvic region or genitalia that is often accompanied by urinary frequency and urgency. Despite considerable research, no definite aetiological risk factors or effective treatments have been identified. The Multidisciplinary Approach to the Study of Chronic Pelvic Pain (MAPP) Research Network uses a novel integrated strategy to characterize UCPPS as a systemic disorder that potentially involves multiple aetiologies. The first phase, MAPP I, included > 1,000 participants who completed an intensive baseline assessment followed by a 12-month observational follow-up period. MAPP I studies showed that UCPPS pain and urinary symptoms co-vary, with only moderate correlation, and should be evaluated separately and that symptom flares are common and can differ considerably in intensity, duration and influence on quality of life. Longitudinal clinical changes in UCPPS correlated with structural and functional brain changes, and many patients experienced global multisensory hypersensitivity. Additionally, UCPPS symptom profiles were distinguishable by biological correlates, such as immune factors. These findings indicate that patients with UCPPS have objective phenotypic abnormalities and distinct biological characteristics, providing a new foundation for the study and clinical management of UCPPS.

### Medications for treatment of interstitial cystitis… [^114795AC]. AAFP (2015). Low credibility.

Clinical Question Which oral medications are effective for the management of interstitial cystitis. Evidence-Based Answer. There are no long-term clinically effective oral medications. Pentosan can improve overall symptom scores for interstitial cystitis over three to six months, but it does not improve scores for any of three individual symptoms compared with placebo. Cimetidine can improve overall symptom scores for interstitial cystitis, and it improves nocturia and suprapubic pain by about 50%. It does not improve dysuria, urgency, frequency, relief after voiding, or incomplete emptying. Amitriptyline and hydroxyzine should not be used to reduce symptom scores for interstitial cystitis.

1 Patients were randomized to pentosan or placebo. Patient self-report questionnaires were used to evaluate symptoms. Pentosan produced minimal or no significant improvement in symptom scores, but a pooled analysis of all five trials showed improvement in overall symptom scores for dysuria, nocturia, frequency, and urgency. Three of the studies reported patient-assessed overall improvement rates, with numbers needed to treat of six to nine. The only adverse effect reported was edema. A single RCT found that cimetidine improved overall urinary symptom scores more than placebo.

Recommendations from Others Guidelines from the American Urological Association recommend patient education, self-care practices, behavioral modification, and stress management as first-line therapy for patients with interstitial cystitis. 6 They recommend oral hydroxyzine, cimetidine, amitriptyline, and pentosan as second-line therapies and note that all of these agents may cause adverse effects and have unpredictable effectiveness.

Regarding patient education for interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome, more specifically with respect to general counseling, AUA 2022 guidelines recommend to educate patients with IC/BPS regarding:

- normal bladder function

- what is known and not known about IC/BPS

- relative risks and benefits of available treatments

- the fact that no single treatment has been found effective for the majority of patients

- the fact that acceptable symptom control may require trials of multiple therapeutic options, including combination therapy.

Management of interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) is individualized for each patient. All patients benefit from education and self-care advice. Patients with Hunner lesions usually respond well to fulguration or triamcinolone injection, which can be repeated when the symptoms and lesions recur. For patients without Hunner lesions, numerous treatment options are available. The tiers of the American Urological Association Guidelines present these options in an orderly progression, balancing the benefits, risks, and burdens. Along with specific IC/BPS treatments, it is also important to have resources for stress reduction, pain management, and treatment of comorbid conditions.

### Current updates relating to treatment for interstitial cystitis / bladder pain syndrome: systematic review and network meta-analysis [^116gnYnN]. BMC Urology (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Through our research, we have revealed for the first time that it is appropriate to try a combination of multiple treatments clinically rather than just one treatment in treating the difficult-to-overcome disease called interstitial cystitis. Even though the outcomes of the NMA were in keeping with the data published in the Cochrane review, the former highlighted an alternative perspective in that in comparison to a placebo, the overall effects of treatment for discomfort, nocturia, ICPI and ICSI were greater. The types of therapy applied included intravesical instillation or injection, and additional strategies, such as diet modification and hyperbaric oxygen. The meta-regression analysis demonstrated that for frequency, the longer the follow-up duration, the more improved the clinical results. Ageing was identified as a negative moderator associated with a poorer end result in nocturia. The NMA showed that in comparison to a placebo, no single therapy offered any benefit to patients with IC. However, where more than one therapeutic approach was applied, such as an adjunctive immune modulator, intravesical injection, intravesical instillation with BTX or HA, or HA and CS, or changes in diet, more positive outcomes could be anticipated which could be demonstrated in the future by RCTs.

### Diagnosis and treatment of interstitial cystitis / bladder pain syndrome [^1164VZjo]. The Journal of Urology (2022). High credibility.

Guideline Statement 23 — long-term oral antibiotics: Long-term oral antibiotic administration should not be offered. Standard (Evidence Strength: Grade B). One RCT reported that an 18 week protocol of sequential antibiotic administration resulted in 20% of the treatment group reporting 50% or greater symptom improvement compared to 16% of the placebo group – a nonsignificant difference, with AEs typical of long-term antibiotic administration. Using less intensive protocols, two observational studies reported higher efficacy rates of 45% and 47%, but the Panel judged that antibiotic treatment is contraindicated in patients who have previously been administered antibiotics without efficacy and who present with a negative urine culture. This Standard is not intended to prevent antibiotic administration to antibiotic-naïve patients; it is focused on preventing repeated or chronic antibiotic administration to patients for whom no relief was obtained in an initial course, and it is also not intended to prevent prophylactic antibiotic administration (e.g., nightly for several months) to patients who present with recurrent UTIs and symptoms suggestive of IC/BPS between infections.

### Diagnosis and management of interstitial cystitis [^116fK9wx]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Interstitial cystitis is a diagnosis of exclusion. The definition has expanded over the years to encompass painful bladder syndrome. It is disease state that is often delayed in its diagnosis and difficult to manage. Treatment options include oral and intravesical therapies as well as both minor and major surgical options. Also, a patient can improve symptoms by following self-management recommendations that focus on both diet and stress management. Treatment options should be periodically evaluated with validated questionnaires to insure they are improving the patient's symptoms, and a multidisciplinary approach is best to manage the patient.

### Diagnosis and treatment of interstitial cystitis / bladder pain syndrome: AUA guideline amendment [^113cePew]. The Journal of Urology (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

The purpose of this amendment is to provide an updated clinical framework for the diagnosis and treatment of interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome based upon data received since the publication of original guideline in 2011.

Materials and Methods

A systematic literature review using the MEDLINE(®) database (search dates 1/1/83–7/22/09) was conducted to identify peer-reviewed publications relevant to the diagnosis and treatment of IC/BPS. This initial review yielded an evidence base of 86 treatment articles after application of inclusion/exclusion criteria. The AUA update literature review process, in which an additional systematic review is conducted periodically to maintain guideline currency with newly published relevant literature, was conducted in July 2013. This review identified an additional 31 articles, which were added to the evidence base of this Guideline.

Results

Newly incorporated literature describing the treatment of IC/BPS was integrated into the Guideline with additional treatment information provided as Clinical Principles and Expert Opinions when insufficient evidence existed. The diagnostic portion of the Guideline remains unchanged from the original publication and is still based on Expert Opinions and Clinical Principles.

Conclusions

The management of IC/BPS continues to evolve as can be seen by an expanding literature on the topic. This document constitutes a clinical strategy and is not intended to be interpreted rigidly. The most effective approach for a particular patient is best determined by the individual clinician and patient. As the science relevant to IC/BPS evolves and improves, the strategies presented will require amendment to remain consistent with the highest standards of care.

### Exploring promising biomarkers based on pathogenic mechanisms in interstitial cystitis / bladder pain syndrome [^113oH2Nn]. Nature Reviews: Urology (2025). High credibility.

Interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS), characterized by bladder discomfort and lower urinary tract symptoms, is often either overtreated or undertreated owing to the complexity and variability of symptoms and the lack of reliable diagnostic tools, leading to reduced quality of life and prolonged illness. The pathophysiology of IC/BPS remains unclear, with multiple hypotheses - such as autoimmune inflammation, oxidative stress and urothelial dysfunction - offering potential explanations. Consequently, a diverse range of urinary biomarkers has emerged, although their diagnostic reliability remains inconsistent. As technology advances, biomarkers are increasingly shifting towards multiplex assays, encompassing genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and cell-based methods; however, cutting-edge research and clinical validation are not yet integrated into the limited diagnostic tools available. Clinical phenotypes from the Multidisciplinary Approach to the Study of Chronic Pelvic Pain Research Network studies provide multi-level biomarker research - including molecular, imaging and other modalities - to support the diagnosis of IC/BPS. Integrating these observations will advance the development of precision medicine for the diagnosis of IC/BPS, thereby improving management of this complex condition.

### How do women with interstitial cystitis / bladder pain syndrome make treatment choices? [^111P8v53]. International Urogynecology Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction and Hypothesis

There is a relative lack of data regarding how patients weigh various factors when choosing a treatment strategy for interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS). Our aim is to describe patient experience with their current and prior treatments and discuss factors they consider when choosing a treatment.

Methods

Twenty-one women with IC/BPS participated in five focus groups moderated by a psychologist. Focus groups were conducted until thematic saturation was reached. Group discussions were transcribed and independently coded by two reviewers. Emergent themes and concepts were identified using grounded theory methodology. Data on symptoms and beliefs regarding medications were collected using validated questionnaires: Interstitial Cystitis Symptom and Problem Index (ICSI and ICPI) and Beliefs in Medications Questionnaire-Specific (BMQ-S).

Results

The median age of participants was 42 years, and all had some college education. Median score (range) for the ICSI was 12 (4, 20) and for the ICPI was 10 (3, 16), indicating moderate symptom burden. Most patients had tried only first- or second-line treatments. The median BMQ-S score was 2, indicating a neutral attitude toward medication. Several themes were identified. Patients expressed interest in self-management of symptoms using a structured care plan that incorporates guided self-care practices and care that can be delivered virtually. Patients desired to minimize treatment side effects by reducing prescription medications and avoiding surgical procedures. Finally, patients had considerable interest in alternative treatments; however, they wanted these treatments to be evidence-based.

Conclusions

Women with IC/BPS have a strong interest in guided programs that teach self-care practices and deliver alternative treatments through remote platforms.

### Research methodology in acupuncture for managing interstitial cystitis / bladder pain syndrome: a scoping review [^116fbgxc]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Guidelines from the Canadian Urological Association (CUA, 2016), the European Society for the Study of Interstitial Cystitis/Bladder Pain Syndrome (ESSIC, 2021), the European Association of Urology (EAU, 2023), the Asian 2020 Clinical Practice Guidelines, and the American Urological Association guideline (AUA, 2022) all define interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) as a condition characterized by chronic pelvic pain (usually suprapubic) and bladder‐related pressure or discomfort, accompanied by other urinary symptoms such as urgency and increased frequency. Additional signs described in the literature include nocturia, sleep disorders, sexual dysfunction, emotional or behavioral issues, and a higher prevalence in women.

Despite this general consensus, definitions vary across regions: North America favors "IC" with a bladder‐centric focus, Europe prefers "BPS" emphasizing pain and broader symptom‐based criteria, and some Asian countries use both terms but apply stricter diagnostic thresholds. These discrepancies pose challenges for global research collaboration, clinical trials, and patient management. Furthermore, some authors consider IC/BPS as synonymous, while others define it as a syndrome, disorder, chronic pelvic pain syndrome, or a symptom.

The unclear pathophysiology of IC/BPS complicates diagnosis and treatment, especially since IC and BPS often overlap but differ: IC involves chronic inflammation, while BPS typically does not. Diagnostic practices vary globally, with North America emphasizing cystoscopy and biopsy for IC, while other regions favor symptom‐based diagnosis and highlight the need for biomarkers to improve early management.

Still, a comprehensive therapeutic solution is needed, so the current approach focuses primarily on symptom relief, starting with conservative treatments, followed by medication and more invasive treatments such as hydrodistension and surgery. Please see Supporting Material for more detailed treatment strategies (S1).

IC/BPS is a challenging condition to treat, with limited effective options, prompting many patients to explore complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). Complementary medicine is used alongside conventional treatments to enhance their effects, while alternative medicine replaces conventional treatments. Acupuncture and moxibustion, both practiced for over 3000 years, are among the most well‐known CAM treatments. The method is commonly practiced as a routine treatment in China, Japan, Korea, and Taiwan, but since the late 1970s, these therapies have gained popularity in the United States and other Western countries.

### Non-surgical interventions for late radiation cystitis in patients who have received radical radiotherapy to the pelvis [^115SW51q]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic radiation cystitis occurs a minimum of three months after completion of pelvic radiotherapy and represents a range of clinical symptoms for which there is as yet no recommended standard management.

Objectives

The aim of this review was to identify the various non-surgical treatment options for the management of late chronic radiation cystitis and evaluate the evidence.

Search Strategy

Synonyms for radiation therapy and for the spectrum of radiation toxicity to the bladder in both text and MeSH terms were combined and applied to a range of databases without restriction of year of publication, methodology or language.

Selection Criteria

The inclusion criteria included studies of interventions for the non-surgical management of all grades of late radiation cystitis.

Data Collection and Analysis

Out of 80 relevant studies, there were no RCTs that met the inclusion criteria, but there were three prospective case series and two non-randomised studies which assessed different interventions and were not comparable.

Main Results

Sixty-three reports met the stated inclusion criteria. The majority were predominantly retrospective case series with the exception of two trials which were unrandomised and unblinded studies with a control group for comparison of effect. Although these two trials, Micic 1988, (intravesical placental extract) and Milani 1988, (flavoxate) provided the strongest evidence they were not randomised and were essentially isolated controlled studies.

Reviewer's Conclusions

In such a relatively rare condition there are obvious difficulties in identifying sufficient patients to participate in a randomised controlled trial. The number of published reports is a reflection of the degree of medical interest that exists in providing therapeutic solutions for late radiation cystitis. However, in spite of the two studies of level IIA evidence, the absence of randomised controlled trials makes it impossible to draw any firm conclusions.

### Cognitive behavioral therapy for chronic pelvic pain: what is It and does It work? [^1131yTSu]. The Journal of Urology (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Urologic chronic pelvic pain syndrome (UCPPS), which encompasses interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome in women and men and chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome in men, is a common, often disabling urological disorder that is neither well understood nor satisfactorily treated with medical treatments. The past 25 years have seen the development and validation of a number of behavioral pain treatments, of which cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is arguably the most effective. CBT combines strategies of behavior therapy, which teaches patients more effective ways of behaving, and cognitive therapy, which focuses on correcting faulty thinking patterns. As a skills-based treatment, CBT emphasizes "unlearning" maladaptive behaviors and thoughts, and replacing them with more adaptive ones that support symptom self-management.

Materials and Methods

This review describes the rationale, technical procedures, and empirical basis of CBT.

Results

While evidence supports CBT for treatment-refractory chronic pain disorders, there is limited understanding of why or how CBT might work, for whom it is most beneficial, or the specific UCPPS symptoms (eg, pain, urinary symptoms) it effectively targets. This is the focus of EPPIC (Easing Pelvic Pain Interventions Clinical Research Program), a landmark NIH trial examining the efficacy of low-intensity, home-based CBT for UCPPS relative to a nonspecific comparator featuring self-care recommendations of AUA guidelines.

Conclusions

Systematic efforts to increase both the efficiency of CBT and the way it is delivered (eg, home-based treatments) are critical to scaling up CBT, optimizing its therapeutic potential, and reducing the public health burden of UCPPS.

### Variations in bladder pain syndrome / interstitial cystitis (IC) definitions, pathogenesis, diagnostics and treatment: a systematic review and evaluation of national and international guidelines [^114MEdFJ]. International Urogynecology Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction and Hypothesis

Interstitial cystitis (IC) and bladder pain syndrome (BPS) are challenging and encompassing hypersensitivity disorders of the lower urinary tract. A variety of national and international guidelines have been published including guidance on nomenclature, definitions, etiopathology, diagnostics and treatment. A lack of universally established clinical guidance is apparent. The aim of this review is to evaluate key guidelines on this area of practice, identify variations, compare their recommendations and grade them using AGREE II.

Methods

Literature searches were performed using the PUBMED and CINAHL database from January 1, 1983, to December 1, 2018, referring to the search strategy of AUA. Ten national and international guidelines were included into the analysis. We assessed the guidelines with the updated AGREE II.

Results

Symptoms congruent in all guidelines are: pain, pressure, discomfort and frequency, urgency and nocturia. Urinalysis is a prerequisite for diagnostics, cystoscopy for most and urodynamics not part of the routine assessment. Treatment options are recommended stepwise. The highest level of evidence and consensus was identified for oral therapies. Nine guidelines had an overall quality score ≥ 50% and three scored ≥ 70% (AUA, GG, RCOG).

Conclusions

The guidelines are congruent in symptom reporting, quite congruent in diagnostics and vary to a high degree on treatment recommendations. The complexity of BPS and emerging evidence indicate the need for regular updating of the guidelines and a wider consensus.
