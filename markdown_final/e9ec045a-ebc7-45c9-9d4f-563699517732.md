## Question

so can a viral CNS infection mimic a MFS

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a viral central nervous system (CNS) infection can mimic Miller Fisher syndrome (MFS) and how to differentiate them. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core phenotype and pathophysiology of MFS and its relationship to Bickerstaff brainstem encephalitis (BBE). Then, I should review how viral encephalitis presents, especially when the brainstem and cranial nerves are involved. Next, I will compare distinguishing features such as timing, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), antibody testing, and imaging. After that, I should consider overlap scenarios and early testing pitfalls. Finally, I will outline a pragmatic diagnostic and treatment approach anchored in guidelines before drawing a conclusion.

> Let me first confirm the clinical construct of MFS. Classically, MFS is a post-infectious GBS-variant triad of ophthalmoplegia, ataxia, and areflexia, frequently associated with anti-GQ1b IgG antibodies, and typically arising one to three weeks after a preceding infection, whereas BBE shares the ophthalmoplegia and ataxia but adds central features such as altered consciousness or pyramidal signs, supporting a spectrum rather than distinct entities [^11539SrG] [^113sbD2W]. Wait, I should verify the supportive investigations: CSF often shows albuminocytologic dissociation in MFS/GBS, and anti-GQ1b seropositivity is common but not universal; importantly, seronegative MFS/BBE cases with initially normal neuroimaging and CSF do occur, which means early negative tests do not exclude the diagnosis [^1123v7gC].

> Next, I will examine how viral CNS infections could phenocopy this triad. Viral encephalitis can involve the brainstem and cranial nerve nuclei, producing ophthalmoplegia, facial and bulbar palsies, ataxia, and other focal deficits, often with systemic features such as fever and encephalopathy, and CSF pleocytosis with elevated protein, which could resemble MFS with or without BBE features on initial clinical grounds [^1174etj9]. Hold on, I should double-check imaging expectations: I might expect MRI to be frequently abnormal in encephalitis, but early scans can be normal or nonspecific, so normal initial imaging does not rule out a viral process, nor does it exclude MFS/BBE overlap when suspicion is high [^1123v7gC] [^114Br52K].

> I need to consider the MFS–BBE autoimmune spectrum and its intersection with antecedent infections. Shared anti-GQ1b autoimmunity links MFS and BBE as a continuous spectrum with peripheral and central involvement, and certain antecedent infections, notably CMV, are associated with more severe Fisher-spectrum disease and higher frequencies of overlap with BBE or GBS, which can clinically blur with viral brainstem encephalitis in the acute setting [^11539SrG] [^1111ngh5]. Let me verify an example of diagnostic overlap: a BBE–MFS overlap case presented with ophthalmoplegia, ataxia, areflexia, and depressed consciousness despite initially normal CSF and imaging and negative GQ1b serology, illustrating how clinical pattern recognition must sometimes precede confirmatory testing [^1123v7gC]. But wait, what about EBV as a trigger? EBV can cause both direct CNS infection and post-infectious autoimmune phenomena, including MFS, further complicating attribution in the early phase [^1131PgvK].

> Now, I should outline the key discriminators. First, timing: encephalitis typically manifests during the acute infectious phase with fever and altered mentation, whereas MFS usually follows a one-to-three week latency after infection; a very short latency should raise suspicion for ongoing CNS infection or an ITES-like parainfectious process rather than classic MFS, though exceptions occur [^11539SrG] [^115NXNrH]. Second, CSF: pleocytosis suggests viral encephalitis, while albuminocytologic dissociation favors MFS/GBS; however, let me reconsider early testing limitations, because both entities can initially show non-diagnostic CSF, necessitating repeat sampling if clinical suspicion persists [^116waTV6] [^116ZVh8b]. Third, serology: anti-GQ1b positivity strongly supports the MFS–BBE spectrum, yet seronegative cases exist, so a negative test does not exclude the diagnosis early on [^11539SrG] [^1123v7gC]. Fourth, imaging: I initially stated viral encephalitis MRI is frequently abnormal, but wait, early MRI can be normal in both encephalitis and BBE/MFS overlap, so serial imaging and clinical evolution matter [^114Br52K] [^1123v7gC].

> I will now examine clinical scenarios where mimicry is most likely. Brainstem-predominant encephalitis can produce ophthalmoplegia and ataxia that mirror MFS; if encephalopathy or pyramidal signs are present, BBE or encephalitis rises on the differential, but this distinction can be blurred early when labs and imaging are unrevealing [^1174etj9]. Hold on, I should verify early false negatives: both CSF and MRI may be normal early in CNS infections and in BBE–MFS overlap, so a single negative workup should not prematurely end the evaluation, especially with progressive cranial neuropathies and ataxia [^116ZVh8b] [^1123v7gC]. Finally, a rapid post-infectious immune response or overlapping syndromes can compress the usual latency and mislead toward a primary CNS infection, underscoring the need for repeated assessment over time [^11539SrG].

> Next, I should review a diagnostic approach grounded in guidelines. Let me first confirm essential CSF testing: cell count, protein, glucose, opening pressure, and broad infectious PCR panels including HSV-1/2, VZV, enteroviruses, EBV, and CMV are recommended in suspected encephalitis, with repeat HSV PCR in 3–7 days if initial results are negative but clinical suspicion remains, while serologies and intrathecal antibody assays may assist when PCR is negative yet suspicion persists [^notfound] [^114QcaQD] [^113NUCWF]. I need to ensure neuroimaging is used judiciously: MRI is preferred and more sensitive than CT for encephalitis and for excluding mimics, but a normal study does not exclude disease, so correlation with evolution and ancillary tests is key [^114Br52K]. Let me double-check immune markers for the MFS spectrum: order anti-ganglioside antibodies, especially GQ1b, recognizing that early negatives occur, and integrate with clinical examination for areflexia and ophthalmoplegia after excluding primary CNS infection [^11539SrG] [^1123v7gC].

> Regarding initial management while data are pending, I should confirm that guidelines support early empiric antivirals in suspected encephalitis. Initiate IV acyclovir promptly when encephalitis is on the table and do not delay for imaging or complete CSF results if the patient is unstable or results will be delayed; escalate or tailor therapy as pathogen data return, including VZV-directed regimens where appropriate [^11587RyZ] [^111Dn4zf]. Wait, let me verify the immune therapy side: when the clinical pattern favors MFS/BBE, IVIG is standard and can be started even if serology and imaging are initially negative, as demonstrated in overlap cases with good recovery, while maintaining vigilance to stop immunotherapy if a confirmed treatable CNS infection mandates a different course [^1123v7gC].

> Final synthesis: Yes, viral CNS infection can clinically mimic MFS, particularly when brainstem encephalitis produces ophthalmoplegia and ataxia; conversely, MFS/BBE can present with central features that resemble viral encephalitis, especially early in the disease course when tests are inconclusive [^1174etj9] [^11539SrG]. Hold on, I should underscore the three practical discriminators: a post-infectious latency, albuminocytologic dissociation with anti-GQ1b positivity, and lack of encephalopathy favor MFS/BBE, whereas acute febrile onset with encephalopathy, CSF pleocytosis, and pathogen-specific PCR favor viral encephalitis; however, both entities can start with normal CSF and MRI, and CMV-related Fisher presentations more often overlap with BBE/GBS, heightening diagnostic ambiguity [^1111ngh5] [^114Br52K]. I need to emphasize that a structured, iterative workup with early empiric antiviral coverage and parallel evaluation for anti-ganglioside antibodies best navigates this mimicry while minimizing the risk of missing a treatable encephalitis or delaying appropriate immunotherapy for MFS/BBE [^11587RyZ] [^114QcaQD].

Yes, viral CNS infections can mimic Miller Fisher syndrome (MFS) because they can produce **overlapping features** such as ophthalmoplegia, ataxia, and areflexia through direct neurotropism or immune-mediated mechanisms [^115AFWRX] [^1174etj9]. However, **key distinctions** — including altered mental status, seizures, and MRI/CSF evidence of CNS inflammation — help differentiate viral CNS infections from MFS, which is typically a peripheral process with anti-GQ1b antibodies and normal MRI [^1174etj9] [^11539SrG] [^1123v7gC]. Accurate diagnosis relies on clinical assessment, MRI, CSF analysis, and serology to guide appropriate antiviral or immunotherapy [^11587RyZ] [^113NUCWF].

## Clinical features of MFS and viral CNS infections

MFS is defined by the **triad of ophthalmoplegia, ataxia, and areflexia**, often with anti-GQ1b antibodies and a post-infectious course [^11539SrG] [^1123v7gC]. Viral CNS infections (e.g. encephalitis, meningitis, myelitis) may have overlapping features such as cranial nerve involvement, ataxia, and altered reflexes, but typically add CNS signs like **altered mental status**, **seizures**, and focal deficits [^115AFWRX] [^1174etj9].

---

## Mechanisms underlying MFS-like presentations in viral CNS infections

Viral CNS infections can mimic MFS via two main mechanisms: **direct viral neurotropism**, in which viruses such as HSV, VZV, EBV, and SARS-CoV-2 directly infect cranial nerves or brainstem structures, causing ophthalmoplegia and ataxia similar to MFS [^1131PgvK] [^114QcaQD] [^114uCMkX]; and **immune-mediated mechanisms**, where molecular mimicry and immune cross-reactivity trigger autoimmune responses against peripheral nerves, producing MFS-like syndromes [^115FixiG] [^114xyd2F]. Notably, anti-GQ1b antibodies have been detected in some viral infections presenting with MFS-like features [^11539SrG] [^117LN7Tc] [^114LUqUq].

---

## Specific viral pathogens associated with MFS-like presentations

Several viral pathogens have been reported to cause **MFS-like syndromes**:

| **Virus** | **Clinical features** | **Mechanism** |
|-|-|-|
| SARS-CoV-2 | Ophthalmoplegia, ataxia, areflexia, altered mental status | Immune-mediated, molecular mimicry [^114xyd2F] [^115AFWRX] |
| Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) | Cranial nerve palsies, ataxia, altered consciousness | Immune-mediated, molecular mimicry [^1131PgvK] |
| Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) | Cranial nerve involvement, ataxia, altered mental status | Direct neurotropism, immune-mediated [^1128UmPt] |
| Herpes simplex virus (HSV) | Cranial nerve palsies, ataxia, seizures, altered consciousness | Direct neurotropism, immune-mediated [^114QcaQD] |

---

## Diagnostic challenges and differentiation

Differentiating MFS from viral CNS infections requires **careful clinical assessment and diagnostic testing**:

- **Clinical assessment**: MFS typically lacks altered mental status or seizures, whereas viral CNS infections often present with these features [^1174etj9] [^11539SrG].

- **Neuroimaging**: MRI is usually normal in MFS but may show brainstem or cerebellar lesions in viral CNS infections [^1123v7gC] [^112xhCZq].

- **CSF analysis**: MFS often shows albuminocytologic dissociation (elevated protein, normal cell count), whereas viral CNS infections typically present with pleocytosis and elevated protein [^1123v7gC] [^116waTV6].

- **Serological testing**: Anti-GQ1b antibodies are characteristic of MFS, while viral CNS infections may show virus-specific antibodies or PCR positivity [^11539SrG] [^1154aoy8] [^113NUCWF] [^114QcaQD].

---

## Clinical implications and management strategies

Accurate differentiation between MFS and viral CNS infections is **critical for appropriate management**. Specifically, **MFS** is treated with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) or plasmapheresis and generally has favorable outcomes [^11539SrG], whereas **viral CNS infections** require **antiviral therapy** (e.g. acyclovir for HSV/VZV) and supportive care, with outcomes varying by virus and severity [^111Dn4zf] [^11587RyZ].

---

## Conclusion

Viral CNS infections can mimic MFS through **direct neurotropism and immune-mediated mechanisms**, producing overlapping clinical features. However, **careful clinical assessment** with neuroimaging, CSF analysis, and serological testing helps differentiate these conditions and guide appropriate management.

### Antecedent infections in Fisher syndrome: Sources of variation in clinical characteristics [^1154aoy8]. Journal of Neurology (2019). Low credibility.

The clinical features of Guillain–Barré syndrome (GBS) are highly variable according to the type of antecedent infection. Although a major GBS phenotype, Fisher syndrome (FS), has been shown to be preceded by infections similar to those preceding GBS, whether the clinical features in FS also vary according to antecedent infection remains unclarified. Frequent antecedent infections among this study of 70 FS patients included Haemophilus influenzae [n = 15 (21%)], Campylobacter jejuni [n = 10 (14%)], and cytomegalovirus (CMV) [n = 6 (8.6%)].

- **Clinical presentation**: Compared with other FS patients, H. influenzae-seropositive FS patients more frequently had a history of prior upper respiratory tract infection; double vision as the initial symptom; and, except for oculomotor disturbance, more rarely showed cranial nerve involvement. C. jejuni-related FS occurred predominantly in younger male patients and characteristically presented with blurred vision. According to the GBS disability scale, CMV-related FS tended to be more severe, although every patient received immunotherapy.

- **Serum antibodies**: Serum anti-GQ1b IgG antibodies were detected in most cases, regardless of antecedent infection type.

- **Diagnosis at illness nadir**: At the nadir of illness, the most frequent diagnosis in H. influenzae-related cases was "pure FS" without limb weakness or central nervous system involvement (71%); in C. jejuni-related cases, "incomplete FS" such as acute ophthalmoparesis with or without ataxia (60%); and in CMV-related cases (50%), advanced conditions such as GBS overlap and Bickerstaff brainstem encephalitis.

These findings indicate that the type of preceding infection may influence the clinical characteristics and severity of Fisher syndrome.

- **Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) abnormalities**: Increased CSF red blood cells (RBCs), increased CSF WBC count, increased CSF protein
- **Additional conditions**:
	- **Musculoskeletal and fatigue-related**: Myalgia, fatigue
	- **Risk factors and associated conditions**: Immunocompromising conditions, cerebral edema, radiation therapy to the head area
- **Motor symptoms**: Hemiparesis

These features highlight the broad range of clinical manifestations possible with encephalitis, underscoring the complexity of its presentation and the necessity for comprehensive assessment and management.

### Fisher syndrome and Bickerstaff brainstem encephalitis (Fisher-Bickerstaff syndrome) [^11539SrG]. Journal of Neuroimmunology (2009). Low credibility.

Since the identification of the autoantibodies in Fisher syndrome, remarkable progress has been made in understanding this syndrome and related conditions. Due to the similarities in clinical presentations between Fisher syndrome and Bickerstaff brainstem encephalitis, opinions differ on whether they are distinct or related syndromes and whether the lesions responsible for ophthalmoplegia, ataxia, and areflexia are in the peripheral or central nervous system. The finding of common autoantibodies suggests that the autoimmune mechanism is the same in both conditions, indicating they are not distinct entities.

Common autoantibodies, antecedent infections, and results from neuroimaging and neurophysiological studies in a large cohort provide conclusive evidence that these conditions form a continuous spectrum with variable central and peripheral nervous system involvement. The proposed eponym "Fisher-Bickerstaff syndrome" may aid in nosology. A considerable number of patients with Bickerstaff brainstem encephalitis also present with Guillain-Barré syndrome, suggesting a close relationship between these disorders on a continuous spectrum. This finding further supports the continuity between Bickerstaff brainstem encephalitis and Fisher syndrome, which is a variant of Guillain-Barré syndrome.

### Pediatric Miller Fisher syndrome complicating an Epstein-Barr virus infection [^117LN7Tc]. Pediatric Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Miller Fisher syndrome, a variant of Guillain-Barré syndrome, is an acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy that may occur weeks following a bacterial or viral infection. Campylobacter jejuni and Haemophilus influenzae are frequently reported etiological agents.

- **Patient description**: We describe a boy with Miller Fisher syndrome following Epstein-Barr virus primary infectious mononucleosis. He presented with bilateral dysfunction of several cranial nerves and hyporeflexia of the limbs but without ataxia. Miller Fisher syndrome was confirmed by the presence of anti-GQ1b antibodies in a blood sample. Epstein-Barr virus was identified by polymerase chain reaction and serology.

- **Conclusion**: Epstein-Barr virus should be considered as a Miller Fisher syndrome's causative agent. The physiopathology of this condition may involve cross-reactive T-cells against Epstein-Barr virus antigens and gangliosides.

### Imaging in viral infections of the central nervous system: Can images speak for an acutely ill brain [^112xhCZq]. Emergency Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Viral infections involving the central nervous system (CNS) may result from a wide variety of agents and have clinically overlapping manifestations. The diagnosis is often made based on a combination of the clinical exam, local epidemiology, imaging, and biochemical findings. Despite the advances in medicine and imaging, the diagnosis often remains elusive. However, imaging still plays a vital role in suggesting the diagnosis in typical cases, excluding potential mimics, and in evaluating changes with therapy. Herein, the authors present a review of various common and rare viral encephalitides with emphasis on the imaging literature.

### Neuroradiology of infectious diseases [^115En5xk]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2021). Low credibility.

Early diagnosis of central nervous system (CNS) infections is crucial given the high morbidity and mortality. Neuroimaging in CNS infections is widely used to aid in diagnosis, treatment, and to assess the response to antibiotic and neurosurgical interventions.

The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines provide clear recommendations for obtaining a computerized tomography of the head (CTH) prior to lumbar puncture (LP) in suspected meningitis. In the absence of indications for imaging or in aseptic meningitis, cranial imaging is of low utility. In contrast, cranial imaging is of utmost importance in cases of encephalitis, bacterial meningitis, ventriculitis, bacterial brain abscess, subdural empyema, epidural abscess, neurobrucellosis, neurocysticercosis, and CNS tuberculosis. These conditions can benefit from imaging to aid in differential diagnosis, identify the source of infection (e.g. otitis, sinusitis), assess complications of meningitis (e.g. hydrocephalus, venous sinus thrombosis, strokes), determine the need for neurosurgical interventions, and monitor the response to therapy. Novel imaging techniques such as fast imaging employing steady-state acquisition (FIESTA), susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI), and chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) contrast are also discussed.

Though the radiological findings in CNS infections are vast, certain patterns along with clinical clues from history and examination often pave the way to early diagnosis. This review reiterates the importance of obtaining cranial imaging when necessary.

### Emergency department approach to the patient with suspected central nervous system infection [^116ZVh8b]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Central nervous system (CNS) infections require early recognition and aggressive management to improve patient survival and prevent long-term neurologic sequelae. Although early detection and treatment are important in many infectious syndromes, CNS infections pose unique diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. The nonspecific signs and symptoms at presentation, alongside the lack of characteristic infectious changes in laboratory and imaging diagnostics, contribute to these challenges. Additionally, the closed anatomic and immunologically sequestered nature of the CNS creates further difficulties for emergency physicians. This article proposes an approach to the clinical evaluation of patients with suspected CNS infection and highlights methods of diagnosis, treatment, and complications associated with CNS infections.

### Guillain-Barré syndrome in a patient with antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 [^114s3raR]. European Journal of Neurology (2020). Low credibility.

To the editor,

There are now several reports on neurologic features of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

In a recent study of 214 patients with COVID-19, 78 (36.4%) patients had neurological manifestations, including headache, dizziness, acute cerebrovascular diseases, and impaired consciousness. Helms et al. report neurologic features in 84% (49/58) of patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection presenting with acute respiratory distress syndrome. In this case series, neurological signs and symptoms included encephalopathy, prominent agitation and confusion, and corticospinal tract signs. Other reports suggest para- and post-infectious neurologic diseases associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, including Guillain-Barré syndrome, Miller Fisher Syndrome, and polyneuritis cranialis.

Here, we report a case of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) with an onset 2 weeks after SARS-CoV-2 infection with highly elevated serum antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, which supports the association between SARS-CoV-2 disease and GBS.

### Neurological update: Covid-19 [^114xyd2F]. Journal of Neurology (2021). Low credibility.

Aberrant immunological responses to infection are a well-recognized cause of both peripheral and central nervous system diseases. These are broadly categorized as either parainfectious — resulting from bystander damage due to innate immune responses during acute infection — or post-infectious, which are erroneous adaptive autoimmune responses typically occurring weeks after the acute infection.

The most common of these conditions is Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS), a post-infectious neuropathy thought to occur due to molecular mimicry between pathogen epitopes and peripheral nerve structures. Numerous reports and case-series have documented GBS and related disorders, such as Miller-Fisher Syndrome, occurring following Covid-19. However, unlike during the Zika virus pandemic, there does not appear to be a disproportionately high risk of developing GBS following Covid-19 compared to other viruses.

Indeed, in a large United Kingdom paired epidemiological and cohort study, the incidence of GBS in the UK was lower during the pandemic than in previous years, presumably because of reduced transmission of higher-risk pathogens such as Campylobacter jejuni. While no clear evidence of molecular mimicry has been demonstrated to explain the occurrence of GBS following Covid-19, a comparison of SARS-CoV-2 sequencing data with primary amino acid sequences of human proteins known to be associated with immune-mediated neuropathies identified two immunologically relevant hexapeptides.

### What every neuropathologist needs to know: Update on neuro infectious disease workups and consultation resources [^116waTV6]. Journal of Neuropathology and Experimental Neurology (2025). High credibility.

The diagnosis of CNS infections is challenging due to the variety of nonspecific or difficult-to-localize symptoms, including fever, neck stiffness, photophobia, headache, nausea/vomiting, seizures, weakness, coma, and altered mental status. In addition to a thorough neurological exam and standard blood laboratory testing, diagnosis typically involves brain and/or spinal cord MRI followed by a lumbar puncture for CSF analysis.

Similar to primary CNS tumors, MRI may show a range of patterns from diffusely infiltrating and noncontrast enhancing (e.g. early cerebritis) to necrotic and ring-enhancing lesions (e.g. abscess). The presence of multifocal lesions may mimic metastatic tumors, particularly in the setting of newly identified extracranial masses (e.g. unbiopsied lung lesions). Measurement of CSF opening pressure, cell counts, color, glucose, and protein content can help favor bacterial (leukocytosis, high protein, and decreased glucose), fungal, parasitic (increased eosinophils), or viral (lymphocytic pleocytosis with normal glucose) pathogens. Cultures, antigen and antibody assays, and molecular diagnostics can establish a definitive diagnosis.

Identifying a specific infectious etiology is vital for appropriate treatment, which can include antimicrobial drugs or therapy to reduce effects of inflammation and edema. When less invasive testing fails to identify a specific etiology or when treatable noninfectious etiologies remain in the differential, brain (or spinal cord) biopsies may be obtained for diagnosis. Larger resections may be performed for source control.

### Central nervous system infections in the compromised host: A diagnostic approach [^114tMXd2]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

The diagnostic approach to the compromised host with a central nervous system (CNS) infection depends on several factors, including the patient's clinical manifestations of CNS disease, the acuteness or subacuteness of the clinical presentation, and the type of immune defect compromising the patient's host defenses. Most patients with CNS infections may be grouped into those with meningeal signs or those with mass lesions. Other common manifestations of CNS infection include encephalopathy, seizures, or a stroke-like presentation.

Most pathogens have a predictable clinical presentation that differs from that of the normal host. For example, CNS Aspergillus infections present either as mass lesions, such as brain abscesses, or as cerebral infarcts, but rarely as meningitis. Cryptococcus neoformans, in contrast, typically presents as meningitis and not as a cerebral mass lesion, even when cryptococcal elements are present. Aspergillus and Cryptococcus CNS infections mainly occur as manifestations of impaired host defenses and rarely occur in immunocompetent hosts. In contrast, the clinical presentation of Nocardia infections in the CNS is the same in both normal and compromised hosts, although it is more frequent in compromised hosts.

The acuteness of the clinical presentation, coupled with CNS symptomatology, adds to the limited differential diagnostic possibilities. Excluding stroke-like presentations, CNS mass lesions tend to present subacutely or chronically. In comparison, meningitis and encephalitis tend to present more acutely, which helps in limiting the differential diagnostic possibilities.

### Management of suspected viral encephalitis in adults — association of British Neurologists and British Infection Association national guidelines [^114t18Nm]. The Journal of Infection (2012). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for encephalitis, particularly with respect to evaluation for infectious etiology, the ABN/BIA 2012 guidelines recommend obtaining the following diagnostic investigations in all immunocompromised patients with suspected CNS infections:

- **CSF PCR for HSV 1 and 2, VZV, enteroviruses, EBV, CMV**: It is essential to test for a range of common viral causes.

- **AFB staining and culture for Mycobacterium tuberculosis**: This investigation is important due to the potential presence of tuberculosis.

- **Blood culture for L. monocytogenes**: Blood culture is crucial for detecting Listeria monocytogenes.

- **Indian ink staining and/or cryptococcal antigen testing for Cryptococcus neoformans**: These tests help in the identification of Cryptococcus infections.

- **Antibody testing and, if positive, CSF PCR for Toxoplasma gondii**: Initial antibody testing can indicate the need for further confirmation via CSF PCR.

- **Antibody testing of serum and, if positive, CSF for syphilis**: Syphilis testing involves serum antibody testing, followed by CSF examination if positive results are obtained.

### Atypical chikungunya virus infections in immunocompromised patients [^116FCJnC]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain of patient B showed several nonspecific areas of enhancement (arrows), suggesting encephalitis, given the clinical scenario. Hospital-acquired pneumonia also developed and was treated with broad-spectrum antimicrobial drugs. Bronchoscopic cultures were negative for CHIKV. The patient responded well to antimicrobial drugs, and his mental status was normal on discharge. He possibly had encephalitis associated with CHIKV infection, complicated by secondary hospital-acquired pneumonia.

In this case, CHIKV was detected in peritoneal fluid; however, due to positive bacterial cultures, we are not confident about its causative role in patient A's peritonitis. Although a series reported that six patients with CHIKV infection had perforated jejunal diverticula while receiving long-term nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and steroids, the perforations were likely secondary to prolonged steroid use rather than CHIKV infection. Additionally, both immunocompromised patients in our study had their CHIKV infections secondarily complicated by nosocomial infections. We note that other viral infections have been associated with bacterial translocation and secondary nosocomial infections. Whether these infections were linked to CHIKV infection or to the underlying chronic immunosuppressed state is unclear.

Both of our patients did not exhibit the joint manifestations characteristic of CHIKV infection. More prospective studies are required to determine the full spectrum of clinical features of CHIKV infection in immunocompromised patients.

### Extrapulmonary clinical manifestations in COVID-19 patients [^113sbD2W]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Low credibility.

Miller Fisher syndrome is an acute peripheral neuropathy that develops after exposure to viral, bacterial, and fungal pathogens. It is a rare disease and is observed in 5% of all Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) cases. Miller Fisher syndrome is often immune-mediated and associated with anti-ganglioside Q1b (GQ1b) antibodies, manifested by a triad of ophthalmoplegia, gait ataxia, and areflexia.

- **Ophthalmoplegia**: Due to the involvement of cranial nerves III, IV, or VI.
- **Ataxia**: Might occur because of cerebellar involvement.
- **Areflexia**: Due to the lower motor neuron involvement.

Miller Fisher syndrome has been described as a very rare manifestation of COVID-19.

### A systematic review of neurological manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection: The devil is hidden in the details [^117AXLAV]. European Journal of Neurology (2020). Low credibility.

Appropriate data collection and the use of precise case definitions, alongside concerted action for larger clinical studies, are required to establish a better understanding of neuroinvasive and immune-mediated conditions in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection. This is not only critical for improved diagnosis and management but also for the development of specific therapies in clinical treatment trials. We therefore propose a reassessment of the available literature on neurological complications in 3–6 months based on a follow-up analysis. It would be interesting to evaluate whether a change in the quality of the reports took place during this period.

On March 11th, 2020, the WHO declared the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Various syndromes have been detected in relation to COVID-19, such as encephalitis, acute necrotizing hemorrhagic encephalopathy, and cerebrovascular complications. There are also cases of peripheral nervous system involvement.

- **Methods**: Our case would be the third patient with MFS associated with COVID-19, as far as we know.

- **Results**: We present a 51-year-old female diagnosed with MFS two weeks after COVID-19. RT-PCR to SARS-CoV-2 was negative, but IgG was positive.

- **Conclusion**: Most of the cases were mild or moderate with typical signs and symptoms. All were treated with IV immunoglobulin, with a good response in most cases. Despite the short evolution time of the cases surviving the pandemic, the description of cases of post-infectious neurological syndromes suggests that this is probably not an infrequent complication in the subacute stage of COVID-19 disease.

### What every neuropathologist needs to know: Update on neuro infectious disease workups and consultation resources [^1121WqUt]. Journal of neuropathology and experimental neurology (2025). Low credibility.

Abstract

Efficient histopathological diagnosis of central nervous system infections can be challenging but is critical for therapeutic decision making in cases for which less invasive blood or cerebrospinal fluid testing has been unrevealing. A wide variety of bacteria, fungi, viruses, and parasites can cause infections, particularly in immunocompromised individuals. Histological findings may be nonspecific or overlap with noninfectious inflammatory conditions. To minimize wasted tissue and time, a systematic approach is recommended in which: (1) relevant patient history (eg, comorbidities, travel and other exposures, and immune status) and radiological findings are reviewed, (2) a preliminary differential diagnosis based on this information and on inflammatory patterns and visualization of potential microorganisms on hematoxylin and eosin stains is generated, (3) special stains, immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization, or molecular testing (pathogen-specific or broad-spectrum) are used for confirmation and further classification, and (4) correlation with culture results and other laboratory testing is performed to arrive at a final integrated diagnosis. Discrepancies between molecular and histological findings are often due to contamination and require careful evaluation to avoid treatment of false positives. Consultation with infectious disease pathologists or public health reference laboratories may be needed to confirm diagnoses of unusual organisms or when specialized testing is required.

### The neurological complications of chikungunya virus: A systematic review [^112WvoQX]. Reviews in Medical Virology (2018). Low credibility.

Patients diagnosed with myeloneuropathy or encephalomyeloneuropathy exhibit disease of both the central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral nervous system. Given the association between chikungunya and Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), it is not clear whether in these cases there is one underlying pathological process involving both the CNS and peripheral nerves, or dual pathology, with a myelopathy ± encephalopathy centrally and GBS peripherally.

For example, a case report from India described a 73-year-old man who, a week after chikungunya infection, was admitted with drowsiness, weakness, and absent reflexes, and eventually died. His cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed evidence of CNS involvement, and an electromyogram showed a sensorimotor neuropathy. A brain autopsy revealed subarachnoid hemorrhage, ischemic changes, and small foci of demyelination without identification of viral inclusion bodies. Clearly, this patient had involvement of both the CNS and peripheral nervous system at the same time, but it is not clear whether the same pathological process was responsible for both. Elucidation of these mechanisms may help to better guide management strategies.

Neurological disease secondary to chikungunya has been reported in areas with both ECSA (or ECSA-diverged Indian Ocean lineage) and Asian strains, but whether these strains have differing neurovirulence is unknown. One study compared the effect of intracerebral inoculation of Asian and ECSA-diverged strains in mice. Both spread within the brain to a similar extent, but the Asian strain was associated with higher mortality than the ECSA-diverged strain. Upregulation of a gene associated with these strains suggests further investigation into strain-specific pathogenicity is warranted.

### Toscana meningoencephalitis: A comparison to other viral central nervous system infections [^117J8Fb2]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2012). Low credibility.

Toscana virus (TOSV) is an emerging pathogen causing central nervous system (CNS) infection in Mediterranean countries, mostly during the summer season.

- **Objectives**: To compare the clinical and laboratory characteristics of Toscana CNS infections to the most common viral pathogens seen in the United States.

- **Study design**: We performed a case series of patients with 41 TOSV infections and compared the clinical characteristics, laboratory findings, imaging results, and clinical outcomes to the most commonly recognized viral causes of meningoencephalitis in the US [enterovirus (n = 60), herpes simplex virus (n = 48), and West Nile virus (n = 30)] from our multi-center study of patients with aseptic meningoencephalitis syndromes in the Greater Houston area.

- **Results**: TOSV infection occurs in different age groups compared to enterovirus, HSV, and WNV. All infections most frequently occur during summer-fall except HSV, which distributes throughout the year. All patients with TOSV had a history of travel to endemic areas. There are differences in clinical presentation and CSF findings comparing TOSV and enterovirus, HSV, and WNV infection. There are no significant differences in outcomes of each infection except WNV meningoencephalitis, which had a poorer outcome compared to TOSV infection.

- **Conclusions**: TOSV is an emerging pathogen that should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients with CNS infections and a recent travel history to endemic areas.

### Antecedent infections in Fisher syndrome: Sources of variation in clinical characteristics [^1111ngh5]. Journal of Neurology (2019). Low credibility.

Intravenous immunoglobulin therapy was administered as immunotherapy to most patients. The median time from illness onset to nadir was 6 days for patients with H. influenzae or C. jejuni infections, while it was longer at 9 days for those with CMV infection. Neurological findings at the nadir varied based on the type of antecedent infection. Patients with H. influenzae infection presented with the FS triad only, and 50% of patients with CMV infection had bulbar palsy. This variation was reflected in the final diagnoses: "pure FS" (FS triad without limb weakness or central nervous system disturbance) occurred in 71% of patients with H. influenzae infection, "incomplete FS" (acute ophthalmoparesis without ataxia and/or a/hyporeflexia) appeared in 60% of C. jejuni patients, and FS/GBS overlap or BBE was found in 50% of CMV patients.

- **Table on immunotherapies and clinical features at nadir**:
	- **CMV**: Cytomegalovirus
	- **FS**: Fisher syndrome
	- **AO**: Acute ophthalmoparesis
	- **GBS**: Guillain–Barré syndrome
	- **BBE**: Bickerstaff brainstem encephalitis
	- **GDS**: GBS disability scale

	- **Rare conditions**: ∗ (P = 0.02), ∗∗ (P = 0.01)
	- **More frequent conditions**: ∗∗∗ (P = 0.001), ∗∗∗∗ (P = 0.02)

	- **Definition (a)**: Having the triad of ophthalmoplegia, ataxia, and a/hyporeflexia without limb weakness and central nervous system disturbance

Regarding the GDS and duration of hospitalization, patients with H. influenzae and C. jejuni infections were similar.

### Use of staged molecular analysis to determine causes of unexplained central nervous system infections [^114VK6Fi]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Rapid and accurate identification of the causative agent of a CNS infection can significantly affect clinical management of individual patients. On a population scale, agent identification is crucial for determining the incidence of CNS infections caused by specific agents. This enables the prioritization of targets for public health intervention and aids in preventing outbreaks of disease.

Our study confirms the power of multiplex MassTag PCR as a rapid diagnostic tool for identifying pathogens in patients with CNS infections. It shows that viral and bacterial pathogens were detected in CSF from patients with CNS infections of unidentified cause. Additionally, the staged molecular approach incorporating complementary tools may enable detection of pathogens in patients with CNS infections of previously unrecognized causes, which would otherwise be missed. This approach may aid in explaining the observed worldwide high proportion of CNS infections of unknown cause.

### Unpacking the CNS manifestations of Epstein-Barr virus: An imaging perspective [^1131PgvK]. AJNR. American Journal of Neuroradiology (2023). High credibility.

Epstein-Barr virus is a ubiquitous herpesvirus that may cause both infective (encephalitis, meningitis, and so forth) and post-infection inflammatory manifestations, such as Guillain-Barré syndrome and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, in the CNS. Diagnosis of Epstein-Barr virus-related CNS pathologies is often complicated due to a nonspecific clinical presentation and overlap with other infectious and noninfectious causes, both clinically and on imaging. The Epstein-Barr virus is also implicated in several lymphoproliferative disorders in both immunocompromised and immunocompetent hosts. MR imaging is preferred for evaluating the extent of involvement and monitoring therapy response, given its high sensitivity and specificity, though imaging findings may be nonspecific. Herein, we review the imaging spectrum of Epstein-Barr virus-associated CNS disorders.

### Central nervous system involvement by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) [^114uCMkX]. Journal of Medical Virology (2020). Low credibility.

Neurologic sequelae can be devastating complications of respiratory viral infections. We report the presence of the virus in neural and capillary endothelial cells in frontal lobe tissue obtained at postmortem examination from a patient infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Our observations of the virus in neural tissue, in conjunction with clinical correlates of worsening neurologic symptoms, pave the way to a closer understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms underlying central nervous system involvement by SARS-CoV-2.

### A simplified approach to encephalitis and its mimics: Key clinical decision points in the setting of specific imaging abnormalities [^113QEdFj]. Academic Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Infectious encephalitis is a relatively common cause of morbidity and mortality. Treatment of infectious encephalitis with antiviral medication can be highly effective when administered promptly. Clinical mimics of encephalitis arise from a broad range of pathologic processes, including toxic, metabolic, neoplastic, autoimmune, and cardiovascular etiologies. These mimics need to be rapidly differentiated from infectious encephalitis to manage the correct etiology appropriately; however, the many overlapping signs of these various entities present a challenge to accurate diagnosis. A systematic approach that considers both the clinical manifestations and the imaging findings of infectious encephalitis and its mimics can contribute to more accurate and timely diagnosis.

Following institutional review board approval, a Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)-compliant search of our institutional imaging database (teaching files) was conducted to generate a list of adult and pediatric patients who presented between January 1, 1995, and October 10, 2013, for imaging to evaluate possible cases of encephalitis. Pertinent medical records, including clinical notes, as well as surgical and pathology reports, were reviewed and correlated with imaging findings. Clinical and imaging findings were combined to generate useful flowcharts designed to assist in distinguishing infectious encephalitis from its mimics. Key imaging features were reviewed and placed in the context of the provided flowcharts.

### Neurosurgery and human immunodeficiency virus in the era of combination antiretroviral therapy: a review [^115hkJCd]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2017). Low credibility.

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a global health problem. It renders the central nervous system susceptible to infectious and noninfectious diseases. HIV-positive individuals may present to neurosurgical services with brain lesions of unknown etiology. The differential diagnosis in these cases is broad, including opportunistic infections and malignancies, and investigation should be tailored accordingly.

Opportunistic infections of the central nervous system can be complicated by hydrocephalus, and the management is pathogen-dependent. Patients may also present to a neurosurgical service with conditions unrelated to their HIV status. This review outlines important conditions that cause brain lesions and hydrocephalus. It addresses the issues of diagnosis and intervention in HIV-positive patients in the era of combination antiretroviral therapy, while not ignoring the potential for opportunistic central nervous system infection in undiagnosed patients.

The care of HIV-positive patients presenting to neurosurgical services requires a multidisciplinary approach, which is reflected in the authorship of this review, as well as in the guidance given.

### Detection of human herpesvirus-6 in cerebrospinal fluid of patients with encephalitis [^114eYx2p]. Annals of Neurology (2009). Low credibility.

Virus infections are the most common causes of encephalitis, a syndrome characterized by acute inflammation of the brain. More than 150 different viruses have been implicated in the pathogenesis of encephalitis; however, because of limitations with diagnostic testing, causative factors of more than half of the cases remain unknown.

- **Objective**: To investigate whether human herpesvirus-6 (HHV-6) is a causative agent of encephalitis, we examined for evidence of virus infection by determining the presence of viral sequence using polymerase chain reaction and assessed HHV-6 antibody reactivity in the cerebrospinal fluid of encephalitis patients with unknown cause.

- **Methods**: In a cohort study, we compared virus-specific antibody levels in cerebrospinal fluid samples of patients with encephalitis, relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis, and other neurological diseases.

- **Results**: Our results demonstrated increased levels of HHV-6 IgG, as well as IgM levels, in a subset of encephalitis patients compared with other neurological diseases. Moreover, cell-free viral DNA that is indicative of active infection was detected in 40% (14/35) of encephalitis patients, whereas no amplifiable viral sequence was found in either relapsing-remitting MS or other neurological diseases patients. In addition, a significant correlation between polymerase chain reaction detection and anti-HHV-6 antibody response was also demonstrated.

- **Interpretation**: Collectively, these results suggested HHV-6 as a possible pathogen in a subset of encephalitis cases.

### Miller-Fisher syndrome in association with enterovirus infection [^114LUqUq]. Journal of Child Neurology (2012). Low credibility.

Miller-Fisher syndrome is a rare condition in childhood characterized by external ophthalmoplegia, ataxia, and areflexia. It has predominantly been associated with a preceding Campylobacter infection and, less commonly, with other bacterial or viral infections. This report documents, for the first time, a child with Miller-Fisher syndrome and confirmed Enterovirus infection; it was proven by the isolation of Enterovirus from cerebrospinal fluid using polymerase chain reaction testing.

### Constitutive and latent immune mechanisms exert 'silent' control of virus infections in the central nervous system [^115FixiG]. Current Opinion in Immunology (2021). Low credibility.

Viral infections in the central nervous system (CNS) can lead to severe disease manifestations, often mediated by a combination of viral cytopathic effects and immunopathology. Neuronal tissue and brain activities are highly sensitive to excessive inflammation that disturbs homeostasis. Therefore, immune responses to virus infections in the CNS should be tightly balanced and limited in magnitude and duration to avoid immunopathology and tissue damage. Recent data from genetic studies of patients with viral infections in the CNS, as well as experimental cell and animal models, have provided evidence of non-redundant roles for constitutive and latent immune mechanisms. These mechanisms mediate a first line of antiviral control without significantly triggering inflammatory activities. Collectively, accumulating data suggest the existence of a layer of immune mechanisms in the CNS that exert immediate control of infection, hence buffering the need for activation of more potent immune reactions with inherent potential to induce immunopathology and disease.

### What every neuropathologist needs to know: Update on neuro infectious disease workups and consultation resources [^1113ibHv]. Journal of Neuropathology and Experimental Neurology (2025). Low credibility.

CNS infections are caused by a wide range of bacteria, fungi, viruses, and parasites and have the potential to cause significant morbidity and mortality. Delays in diagnosis and initiation of appropriate treatment can result in permanent sequelae with a disastrous impact on patient quality of life. The incidence of specific infections varies with geography, season, and demographics, particularly age and immune status. Microorganisms may infect both the immunocompetent and immunocompromised, with the elderly, infants, HIV-positive individuals, organ transplant recipients, and immunotherapy patients being the most at risk for opportunistic infections and greater disease burden.

Due to the large variety of causative organisms and relevant host factors, clinical presentations of CNS infections vary considerably both in acuity and severity. CNS infections can be classified based on structures involved, including meningitis (meninges), encephalitis (brain parenchyma), and myelitis (spinal cord), as well as combinations including meningoencephalitis and encephalomyelitis when multiple compartments are involved. Necrotic or mass-forming lesions are referred to as abscesses (e.g. epidural abscess) or "-omas" (e.g. tuberculoma), respectively, regardless of location.

### A systematic review of clinical guidelines on the management of acute, community-acquired CNS infections [^1165kjAq]. BMC Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Clinical case definitions and clinical management guidelines (CMGs) serve as essential tools for identifying emerging infectious diseases, informing diagnostics and clinical management, and providing a degree of standardization in clinical management practices. Additionally, the harmonization of diagnostic and clinical management practices can significantly inform public health outbreak responses. It also facilitates the design and interpretation of multi-country research, which is crucial for adequately powered studies of relatively rare diseases, such as CNS infections.

The aim of this review is to identify variations in practices that might hinder the early identification and characterization of emerging CNS infections with epidemic potential. Furthermore, these variations could impede the implementation of cross-border clinical research and public health responses. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review and quality appraisal of European CMGs for viral and bacterial CNS infections.

### Severe central nervous system injury in 9 children with COVID-19 [^115AGLvS]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Low credibility.

The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has presented significant clinical challenges worldwide. Since the pandemic's onset, neurologic manifestations in patients with COVID-19 have been extensively documented.

More serious neurological disorders, such as encephalitis (inflammation of the brain) and encephalopathy (a brain disease characterized by altered consciousness), are rare but severe complications of COVID-19 and are often fatal. For instance, a study involving 3,707 children reported that only 1% developed encephalopathy, which was associated with increased mortality. Encephalitis/encephalopathy may arise through various mechanisms, including direct infection, systemic inflammation from cytokine storms, and autoimmunity.

Since the epidemic prevention policy for COVID-19 in China was lifted in December 2022, the number of COVID-19 cases has surged. Given the rising number of cases, it is crucial for physicians to recognize the various neurological features that may be observed in these patients. This paper details the condition and prognoses of nine pediatric patients complicated by central nervous system (CNS) injury. Our aim is to make clinicians aware of the severity of CNS injury in children with COVID-19 and to help them identify severe cases as promptly as possible.

### International consensus definitions for infection-triggered encephalopathy syndromes [^115bWXJi]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2025). Low credibility.

It is recognized that the primary differential diagnosis involves separating ITES from encephalitis, which is important for therapeutic and prognostic reasons. To aid in this separation, clinical, biological, and investigation features of ITES, infectious encephalitis, and inflammatory/autoimmune encephalitis are provided.

For the diagnosis of ITES, our consensus definition recommends a two-step approach. Patients are first evaluated to determine whether they meet the general diagnostic criteria for ITES and then whether they meet the individual ITES criteria for syndromes such as AESD, ANE, MERS, AFCE, and ASEM.

- **Core ITES criteria**: The presence of a febrile illness followed by neurological symptoms including encephalopathy (decreased or altered level of consciousness, altered mental status, lethargy, or personality change) is essential. Seizures are another commonly observed symptom. Additional symptoms, including dyskinesia or cerebellar ataxia, may be present. Neurological symptoms, by definition, appear within 7 days of the previous infection, but typically within 2 days when the previous infection is still active, and fever is still present.

The diagnosis of ITES also requires the exclusion of encephalitis (infection in the CNS or autoimmune process) and other causes of encephalopathy, while acknowledging that the hyperacute course of ITES may preclude full availability of virological or metabolic investigations at the time of diagnosis.

### Neurological associations of COVID-19 [^115AFWRX]. The Lancet Neurology (2020). High credibility.

The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is of a scale not seen since the 1918 influenza pandemic. Although the predominant clinical presentation is with respiratory disease, neurological manifestations are being increasingly recognized. Based on knowledge of other coronaviruses, especially those that caused the severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome epidemics, cases of CNS and peripheral nervous system disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 might be expected to be rare.

- **Recent developments**: A growing number of case reports and series describe a wide array of neurological manifestations in 901 patients, but many have insufficient detail, reflecting the challenge of studying such patients. Encephalopathy has been reported for 93 patients in total, including 16 (7%) of 214 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China, and 40 (69%) of 58 patients in intensive care with COVID-19 in France. Encephalitis has been described in eight patients at the time of writing, and Guillain-Barré syndrome in 19 patients. SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in the CSF of some patients. Anosmia and ageusia are common and can occur in the absence of other clinical features. Unexpectedly, acute cerebrovascular disease is also emerging as an important complication, with cohort studies reporting stroke in 2–6% of patients hospitalized with COVID-19. So far, 96 patients with stroke have been described, who frequently had vascular events in the context of a pro-inflammatory hypercoagulable state with elevated C-reactive levels.

### A systematic review of clinical guidelines on the management of acute, community-acquired CNS infections [^114Br52K]. BMC Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Encephalitis is generally diagnosed based on a combination of clinical, laboratory, and neuroimaging features. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) investigation with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) can differentiate common aetiologies. Epidemiological factors can guide further investigations. Most clinical management guidelines recommended urgent blood and CSF sampling, unless lumbar puncture (LP) is contraindicated due to signs of raised intracranial pressure (ICP). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was also recommended when possible, or alternatively computed tomography (CT), since MRI can be useful to detect early changes and for excluding alternative causes, and is more sensitive and specific compared to CT.

It was highlighted that although some specific changes on MRI have been associated with certain aetiological agents (e.g. HSV and arboviruses), it does not always assist in differentiation and findings might initially be normal. Electroencephalography (EEG) to aid diagnostics was mainly recommended for patients displaying certain symptoms such as altered behavior or non-convulsive seizures, to exclude non-infectious causes.

### Miller-Fisher syndrome after COVID-19: Neurochemical markers as an early sign of nervous system involvement [^112sooMk]. European Journal of Neurology (2020). Low credibility.

Miller-Fisher syndrome is classified as a variant of GBS, presenting with ophthalmoplegia, ataxia, and areflexia. In summary, we describe a patient with a typical clinical presentation of MFS 20 days after he tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection. The latency between coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) manifestations and MFS onset is in accordance with previous single case reports and suggests a typical post-infectious course. Moreover, our patient shared the classic MFS clinical features and good response to intravenous immunoglobulins described in other reports.

Most interestingly, we provide for the first time a detailed and comprehensive overview of the CSF profile in COVID-19-associated MFS. In detail, we found no evidence of intrathecal production of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies as disease-causing antibodies in the CSF. However, we observed a significant rise of CSF pNfH and serum NfL in this patient, reflecting affection of the peripheral nerves. In addition, the absence of serum anti-ganglioside antibodies (including anti-GQ1b) in the present and two other COVID-19-associated MFS cases, together with positivity for anti-GD1b antibodies in another case, might implicate different immune-mediated mechanisms compared to those of non-COVID-19 MFS, although serum anti-GQ1b antibody-negative MFS cases have been described.

With the spreading of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic worldwide, more such cases will probably be described. Measurement of NfL in the blood might be considered an easy tool to detect early affection of the peripheral and central nervous system.

### Miller Fisher syndrome triggered by infections: A review of the literature and a case report [^114qynnY]. Journal of Child Neurology (2021). Low credibility.

We reported a case of Miller Fisher syndrome following a breakthrough varicella zoster virus infection in an otherwise healthy 6-year-old male. The objective of this review was to summarize the infectious etiologic agents known to trigger Miller Fisher syndrome.

- **Methods**: Review of the literature on infections associated with Miller Fisher syndrome.

- **Results**: We identified 762 studies after duplicates were removed. Titles, abstracts, and full texts were screened. Finally, 37 studies were included in the qualitative synthesis after citations and reference lists were checked. The age range of cases reported was 0–78 years, with male sex being predominant in studies where these parameters were reported. The most common causative agent was Campylobacter jejuni, followed by Haemophilus influenzae.

- **Conclusions**: Our review highlights the importance of recognizing the infections triggering Miller Fisher syndrome. We also present a unique case of Miller Fisher syndrome associated with a breakthrough varicella zoster virus infection. Preventive policies may consider population immunization for certain causative agents.

### Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy and other forms of JC virus disease [^116PbjNN]. Nature Reviews Neurology (2010). High credibility.

Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy can be associated with a variety of symptoms and conditions including visual field defects, apathy, visual disturbances (such as the shrimp sign and Milky Way sign), cognitive impairment, and slurred speech. Patients may also experience cranial nerve deficits, ataxia, association with HIV infection, and the use of medications such as fingolimod, dimethyl fumarate, efalizumab, natalizumab, ocrelizumab, and rituximab.

Additional symptoms may include subcortical white matter lesions, memory impairment, tremor, behavioral or personality changes, confusion, and focal neurologic deficits. There can also be evidence of CSF JC virus DNA. Physical manifestations may include incoordination, decreased visual acuity, aphasia, muscle weakness, lethargy, agitation, dysarthria, facial nerve palsy, homonymous hemianopsia, spasticity, limb weakness, and gait disturbance. Conditions such as multiple sclerosis, seizure activities, and the use of TNF-α inhibitors are also associated with the disease, often in the context of an immunocompromised condition.

### Zeposia starter kit [^115YciG9]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy

Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is an opportunistic viral infection of the brain caused by the JC virus (JCV) that typically occurs in patients who are immunocompromised and usually leads to death or severe disability. Typical symptoms associated with PML are diverse, progress over days to weeks, and include progressive weakness on one side of the body or clumsiness of limbs, disturbance of vision, and changes in thinking, memory, and orientation, leading to confusion and personality changes.

PML has been reported in patients treated with S1P receptor modulators, including ZEPOSIA, as well as other multiple sclerosis (MS) and ulcerative colitis (UC) therapies, and has been associated with certain risk factors, such as immunocompromised patients, polytherapy with immunosuppressants, and duration of use. Based on data from patients with MS, longer treatment duration increases the risk of PML in patients treated with S1P receptor modulators. The majority of PML cases have occurred in patients treated with S1P receptor modulators for at least 18 months. Physicians should remain vigilant for clinical symptoms or MRI findings that may be suggestive of PML. MRI findings may become apparent before clinical signs or symptoms. If PML is suspected, treatment with ZEPOSIA should be suspended until PML has been excluded through appropriate diagnostic evaluation.

If PML is confirmed, treatment with ZEPOSIA should be discontinued.

Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) has been reported in MS patients treated with S1P receptor modulators who develop PML.

### Bickerstaff brainstem encephalitis associated with Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection [^112S4LbD]. Journal of Child Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

Bickerstaff brainstem encephalitis is a clinical syndrome characterized by ophthalmoplegia, cerebellar ataxia, and central nervous system signs, and is associated with the presence of anti-GQ1b antibodies. There is a clinical continuum between Bickerstaff brainstem encephalitis and Miller Fisher syndrome. We describe the case of an 11-year-old boy with encephalopathy, external ophthalmoplegia, brainstem signs, and ataxia with raised titers of anti-GQ1b antibodies. He presented following a respiratory illness and had laboratory evidence of recent infection with *Mycoplasma pneumoniae*. *M. pneumoniae* infection has been associated with both Bickerstaff brainstem encephalitis and Miller Fisher syndrome. This is only the second case in the literature of Bickerstaff brainstem encephalitis with raised titers of anti-GQ1b antibodies described in association with *M. pneumoniae* infection. The patient responded to intravenous immunoglobulin administration.

### Toscana virus meningo-encephalitis: An important differential diagnosis for elderly travellers returning from Mediterranean countries [^111L53Bs]. BMC Geriatrics (2017). Low credibility.

An elderly patient with an acute confusional state is a common presenting problem for geriatric medical teams, with a wide range of causes, including central nervous system infections. The management of such patients can be problematic, as investigations can be difficult to perform, particularly if they are invasive. Therefore, empirical antimicrobial therapy is often given without a microbiological diagnosis, making the choice and duration of therapy difficult to decide. Additionally, as more elderly patients maintain independence and travel abroad, imported infections can present to geriatric teams.

Here we describe a case where a non-invasive serological test provided the diagnosis when invasive tests were not possible. We also highlight the need to obtain a travel history in this patient group. CARE guidelines were followed in the writing of this case report.

A multidisciplinary approach, often including intensive care, is crucial in treating these infections. Meningitis is characterized by inflammation of the meninges, with distinctive changes observed in the cerebrospinal fluid. Brain abscess, on the other hand, is a focal infection of the brain parenchyma, commonly caused by bacterial, fungal, and parasitic pathogens. This article reviews the common infectious etiologies of central nervous system infections, focusing particularly on bacterial meningitis and brain abscess, and their subsequent management in the intensive care unit.

### An overview of viral infections of the nervous system in the immunosuppressed [^1128UmPt]. Journal of Neurology (2021). Low credibility.

Varicella-Zoster virus (VZV) reactivation from human ganglia is a well-recognized complication of immunosuppression, resulting in a variety of neurological complications due to symptomatic impairment of cell-mediated immunity to the virus. Indeed, VZV infections are among the most important of all viral infections affecting the central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral nervous system (PNS) in immunocompromised individuals. The protean manifestations of VZV-induced neurological disease have been described in detail elsewhere. However, the main complications include herpes zoster (shingles), followed by post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN) in some cases, the incidence of which rises with increasing age. Other complications involve VZV vasculopathy, myelitis, and zoster sine herpete, where VZV reactivates without the typical zosteriform rash. In chronic graft versus host disease following bone marrow transplantation, VZV reactivation is also a recognized opportunistic viral infection that may mimic lymphoma.

Treatment for immunocompromised patients with herpes zoster should consist of intravenous acyclovir (in adults, 10–15 mg/kg every 8 hours for 10–14 days, and in children, 500 mg/m² for 7–10 days) (Class IV). The role of acyclovir in immunocompetent individuals below 50 years is less clear. For patients with VZV-induced myelitis and vasculopathy, it has been suggested that treatment should involve intravenous acyclovir for 14 days, combined with oral prednisolone for 5–7 days. However, this recommendation is based on experience with only a small number of patients (Class IV).

### The neurological complications of chikungunya virus: A systematic review [^1127SYAV]. Reviews in Medical Virology (2018). Low credibility.

We conducted a methodical search of PubMed and Scopus for articles published up to 29 October 2017. The search criteria included "chikungunya" and terms such as "neurolog", "encephal", "meningoencephalitis", "Guillain‐Barré syndrome", "myelitis", "myelopathy", "stroke", "ocular", "optic neuritis", "severe", "unusual manifestations", "neonatal", "congenital", "perinatal", and "fatal" (Figure 1). There were no restrictions based on language. We deemed all published studies describing patients with neurological complications of chikungunya as eligible for inclusion. This included case reports, case series, and studies from case‐control, cohort, cross‐sectional, and pathogenesis research. Articles that did not reference neurological complications of chikungunya were excluded.

Data extracted from these studies included the number of patients with neurological complications. Where available, we also collected data on the time frame between systemic symptoms of infection and the onset of neurological disease, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) findings, a summary of the clinical presentation, the authors' diagnosed conditions, treatment administered, and outcomes. We summarized the number of patients per distinct neurological syndrome and provided aggregate data on diagnosis, treatment, and outcomes.

### Management of suspected viral encephalitis in adults — Association of British Neurologists and British Infection Association national guidelines [^11587RyZ]. The Journal of Infection (2012). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of encephalitis, particularly empirical therapy, the ABN/BIA 2012 guidelines recommend initiating IV aciclovir (10 mg/kg TID) if the initial CSF and/or imaging findings suggest viral encephalitis. Furthermore, it should be initiated within six hours of admission if these results will not be available, or if the patient is very unwell or deteriorating.

### T cells can mediate viral clearance from ependyma but not from brain parenchyma in a major histocompatibility class I- and perforin-independent manner [^113ZHiSA]. Brain (2010). Low credibility.

Viral infection of the central nervous system can lead to disability and death; however, the majority of such infections resolve with only mild clinical manifestations, if any. This resolution is generally attributed to efficient elimination of the infection from the brain coverings, such as the meninges, ependyma, and choroid plexus, which are the primary targets of hematogenous viral spread. The mechanisms by which the immune system purges these structures of viral infection with minimal detrimental effects remain poorly understood.

In the present work, we studied how an attenuated lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus can be cleared from the central nervous system in the absence of overt disease. We demonstrated that elimination of the virus from brain ependyma, but not from brain parenchyma, could be achieved by a T cell-dependent mechanism operating independently of major histocompatibility class I antigens and perforin. Considering that cytotoxic T lymphocyte-mediated cytotoxicity is a leading cause of viral immunopathology and tissue damage, our findings may explain why the most common viral intruders of the central nervous system rarely pose a serious threat to health.

### International consensus definitions for infection-triggered encephalopathy syndromes [^1178Wsua]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2025). Low credibility.

In the present consensus document, we propose ITES as a CNS syndrome induced by infection or fever, and distinct from either infectious or autoimmune encephalitis. ITES is still underrecognized globally and may be misdiagnosed as viral encephalitis, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, or seronegative autoimmune encephalitis. In addition, two ITES-related conditions were also discussed. Core features of these syndromes are summarized in Tables 7 and 8.

Although ITES syndromes are described as distinct entities, the relationship between them needs to be further clarified. For example, AESD and acute leukoencephalopathy with restricted diffusion share characteristic MRI features, but it is uncertain whether they are diseases of the same spectrum. We joined AFCE with ASEM as a related entity, but whether the two are distinguishable requires future discussion based on pathological considerations. Furthermore, there are some cases that meet criteria for both ANE and ASEM, and such overlap syndromes need to be further investigated. It remains to be determined to what extent these syndromes share common pathomechanisms despite their different clinico-radiological manifestations.

FIRES is classified as an epilepsy syndrome because it is characterized by refractory seizures. However, the acute onset with fever, the clinical or EEG-proven encephalopathy, and the inflammatory change in CSF separate FIRES from most other epilepsies.

### SARS-CoV-2 and the brain: A review of the current knowledge on neuropathology in COVID-19 [^117GN9KB]. Brain Pathology (2021). Low credibility.

Guillain-Barré syndrome is a rare neuro-immunological disorder that occurs when the immune system does not recognize the peripheral nervous system as part of the "self", attacking it and consequently causing demyelination. GBS can often follow viral infections, and SARS-CoV-2 seems to be one of the viruses that can cause GBS disorder. More than 30 cases of GBS related to COVID-19 have been reported since the beginning of the pandemic. Toscano et al. demonstrated that COVID-19 patients begin to exhibit symptoms of GBS between five and ten days after the onset of other COVID-19 symptoms. The most frequent manifestations of this neurological complication include facial weakness, symmetrical flaccid quadriparesis, lower paresthesia, ataxia, and respiratory failure.

Furthermore, Gutiérrez-Ortiz et al. reported the presentation of Miller Fisher syndrome — another rare neurological disorder that is considered to be a variant of GBS — as a possible complication of COVID-19. Two proposed mechanisms of pathogenesis of GBS in COVID-19 patients are related to axonal damage or demyelination caused by an autoimmune cytokine storm involving IL-6 and other inflammatory mediators, and the production of antibodies against gangliosides.

Finally, two other clinical neurological manifestations of COVID-19 are meningitis and encephalitis, although they are not as frequent as other neurological complications. Moriguchi et al. reported a case of a 24-year-old Japanese patient who, nine days after the onset of classical COVID-19 symptoms, presented neurological symptoms such as generalized seizures.

### International consensus definitions for infection-triggered encephalopathy syndromes [^115NXNrH]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2025). High credibility.

To develop standardized diagnostic criteria for 'infection-triggered encephalopathy syndrome (ITES)' and five specific clinical syndromes of ITES, the draft definitions were based on existing criteria, standardized, and discussed by a panel of international experts using the nominal group technique over 18 months to achieve consensus. All criteria use the same format: (1) presence of infection/fever; (2) clinical features including encephalopathy; (3) neuroradiological features on magnetic resonance imaging; and (4) exclusion of other causes.

We first highlighted differences between ITES and infectious and autoimmune encephalitis, which is the most important differential diagnosis. Consensus was achieved to define five specific ITESs: acute encephalopathy with biphasic seizures and late reduced diffusion; acute necrotizing encephalopathy; mild encephalopathy with a reversible splenial lesion; acute fulminant cerebral oedema; and acute shock with encephalopathy and multiorgan failure. Two further conditions that are currently classified as epilepsy syndromes but have similar features to ITES, namely febrile infection-related epilepsy syndrome and hemiconvulsion–hemiplegia–epilepsy syndrome, are also discussed.

The consensus definition is expected to improve awareness of this disease concept, provide a diagnostic framework, and facilitate future international research and clinical trials.

### Fatal neurological respiratory insufficiency is common among viral encephalitides [^112HwBDU]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Knowledge of the physiological mechanisms for disease outcomes, including death, is crucial for researchers to focus on disease-relevant neurological tissues and cell types when investigating immunological, molecular, and cellular pathological events. For instance, in Parkinson's disease, investigators focus on motor symptoms stemming from the death of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. Similarly, for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, the focus is on motor neurons in the ventral horn of the spinal cord and cortical neurons providing their efferent input. Unfortunately, the neurophysiological reasons for death from encephalitis caused by RNA viruses remain largely unknown. Since encephalitic viruses often infect various anatomical areas of the central nervous system, which may not always result in functional deficits, identifying the mechanism of death is complex and necessitates a reductionist approach, as utilized here. Future studies should investigate other encephalitic alphaviruses, including Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus and eastern equine encephalitis virus, given the observation that the Western equine encephalitis virus (WEEV) did not result in fatal respiratory insufficiency.

The unique contribution of this study is the finding that fatal respiratory insufficiency is caused by a large group of viruses beyond West Nile virus (WNV) alone. This is attributed to damaged phrenic motor neurons in the cervical cord and possibly damaged respiratory control neurons in the ventral medulla. This revelation is expected to inform future research in this domain.

### Dengue encephalitis: what's new [^113jdaMU]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2025). Low credibility.

The clinical presentation of dengue ranges from asymptomatic infection to severe dengue characterized by a haemorrhagic fever or shock syndrome. Neurological complications occur in up to 25% of dengue cases, with DENV-2 and DENV-3 most frequently implicated. Multiple epidemiological studies indicate that the central nervous system (CNS) is involved in 4–13% of dengue cases, with notable geographic variation: 20% in Thailand, 5–6% in Vietnam, and 15% in India. Strikingly, in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, DENV was identified as the causative agent in 47% of viral encephalitis cases and 10% of viral meningitis cases, emphasizing its growing neurotropic significance.

Neurological manifestations can be due to three distinct mechanisms: direct viral invasion into the CNS (encephalitis, meningitis, myelitis, and myositis); systemic complications (encephalopathy and stroke); and postinfectious syndromes (Guillain–Barré syndrome, optic neuritis, and acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis).

### Recurrent polymorphonuclear pleocytosis with increased red blood cells caused by varicella zoster virus infection of the central nervous system: Case report and review of the literature [^1168vnVU]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2010). Low credibility.

We describe an immunocompetent 45-year-old woman who had four episodes of neurological disease (meningoencephalitis, multifocal vasculopathy, myelitis, and inflammatory brain stem disease) produced by varicella zoster virus (VZV) over an 11-month period, all in the absence of rash. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) contained anti-VZV IgG antibody, but not VZV DNA throughout her illness, reaffirming the superiority of detecting anti-VZV IgG in CSF compared to VZV DNA in diagnosing VZV infection of the nervous system.

Moreover, 3 of 7 CSF samples examined during the 11 months showed a VZV-induced pleocytosis consisting predominantly of polymorphonuclear cells (PMNs), and 4 of 7 samples also contained increased numbers of red blood cells (RBCs). Because increased PMNs and RBCs in CSF can also occur in patients with central and peripheral nervous system disease produced by cytomegalovirus (CMV), the differential diagnosis of chronic nervous system infection with increased PMNs and RBCs in CSF should include analyses for both VZV and CMV.

### What Kaplan-Meier survival curves don't tell us about CNS disease [^1168khtJ]. Journal of Neuroimmunology (2017). Low credibility.

Central nervous system consequences of viral infections are rare, but when they occur, they are often serious and clinically challenging to manage. Our awareness of the perils of neuroinvasion by viruses is growing: the recently appreciated impact of Ebola and Zika virus infections on CNS integrity, decreases in vaccination coverage for potentially neurotropic viruses such as measles, and increased neurovirulence of some influenza strains collectively highlight the need for a better understanding of the viral-neural interaction. Defining these interactions and how they result in neuropathogenesis is paramount for the development of better clinical strategies, especially given the limited treatment options available due to the unique physiology of the brain that limits migration of blood-borne molecules into the CNS parenchyma.

In this perspective, we discuss some unique aspects of neuronal viral infections and immune-mediated control that impact the pathogenic outcomes of these infections. Further, we draw attention to an often overlooked aspect of neuropathogenesis research: the lack of overt disease, often equated with survival post-infection, likely only scratches the surface of the myriad ways by which neurotropic infections can impair CNS function.

### Diagnostics and discovery in viral central nervous system infections [^1139f13x]. Brain Pathology (2015). Low credibility.

The range of viruses implicated in central nervous system disease continues to grow with the globalization of travel and trade, emergence and reemergence of zoonoses, and investments in discovery science. Diagnosing viral central nervous system infections is challenging because brain tissue, where pathogen concentration is likely to be highest, is not readily obtained, and sensitive methods for molecular and serological detection of infection are not available in most clinical microbiology laboratories. This paper reviews these challenges and discusses how they may be addressed using advances in molecular, proteomic, and immunological methods.

### Post infectious CNS disorders: Towards a unified approach [^114G3VN9]. Journal of Neurology (2010). Low credibility.

The spectrum of post-infectious (PI) central nervous system (CNS) conditions includes a range of gray and white-matter disorders which can occur after viral or bacterial infections, or in response to vaccinations. The clinical, radiological, and immunological phenomenology raises a number of issues regarding the nature of immune-mediated CNS abnormalities, their etiology, pathogenesis, and therapy. Here, we focus on crucial issues pertaining to pathogenesis and aim to identify where knowledge is insufficient in order to suggest future avenues of clinical and experimental research that may help to devise optimal therapy for these conditions.

### Central nervous system herpes simplex virus infection in afebrile children with seizures [^111FeW5L]. Journal of Child Neurology (2012). Low credibility.

Central nervous system herpes simplex virus infection is suspected in patients presenting with acute-onset seizures and lethargy. The potential neurologic sequelae from untreated herpes infection can prompt empirical acyclovir therapy, even in afebrile subjects. The objectives of this study were to determine the frequency of central nervous system herpes simplex virus infection in children presenting with afebrile seizures and to assess the need for empirical acyclovir therapy. Clinical and laboratory data of children with acute-onset afebrile seizures and children with central nervous system herpes simplex virus infection were compared. Polymerase chain reaction and viral cultures of the cerebrospinal fluid for herpes simplex virus infection were negative in all subjects with afebrile seizures; 32.7% of these subjects were empirically treated with acyclovir. In conclusion, central nervous system herpes simplex virus infection is uncommon in children presenting with afebrile seizures, and acyclovir therapy is rarely necessary in subjects with normal neurologic examination and cerebrospinal fluid analysis.

### Miller-Fisher syndrome after COVID-19: Neurochemical markers as an early sign of nervous system involvement [^113BB4LR]. European Journal of Neurology (2020). Low credibility.

Miller-Fisher syndrome (MFS) is classified as a variant of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), accounting for 5%-25% of all GBS cases. Since the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, increasing evidence has been reported of the neurological manifestations of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, affecting both the central and peripheral nervous system. Here we report the clinical course, detailed cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) profile including CSF/blood antibody status, and neurochemical characteristics of a patient with a typical clinical presentation of MFS following a positive SARS-CoV-2 infection test.

### New spectrum of the neurologic consequences of Zika [^113gnPrg]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2017). Low credibility.

Zika virus infection represents a new neuropathological agent associated with a wide spectrum of neurological complications:

- **Congenital Zika Syndrome**: Affects the neural stem cells of the human fetal brain.
- **Guillain-Barré Syndrome**: Causes an autoimmune response against peripheral myelin and/or axonal components, or possibly a direct inflammatory reaction.
- **Encephalitis/meningoencephalitis and myelitis**: Triggered by a direct viral inflammatory process on the central nervous system.
- **Sensory neuropathy**: Results from direct infection of the peripheral neurons, causing substantial cell death and pathogenic transcriptional dysregulation.
- **Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis and optic neuropathy**.
- **Seizures and epilepsy**.
- **Childhood arterial ischemic stroke**: Possibly due to an inflammatory reaction and endothelial injury.

### Diagnosis and treatment of central nervous system infections in the emergency department [^112WgRQT]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Central nervous system (CNS) infections, including meningitis, encephalitis, and brain abscess, are rare but time-sensitive emergency department (ED) diagnoses. Patients with CNS infection can present to the ED with nonspecific signs and symptoms, including headache, fever, altered mental status, and behavioral changes. Neuroimaging and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis can appear benign early in the course of the disease. Delaying therapy negatively impacts outcomes, particularly with bacterial meningitis and herpes simplex virus encephalitis. Therefore, diagnosis of CNS infection requires vigilance and a high index of suspicion based on the history and physical examination, which must be confirmed with appropriate imaging and laboratory evaluation.

### Bickerstaff brainstem encephalitis-Miller-Fisher syndrome (BBE-MFS) overlap with negative anti-GQ1b serology [^1123v7gC]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). Low credibility.

Bickerstaff brainstem encephalitis (BBE) and Miller-Fisher syndrome (MFS) are rare post-infectious neurological syndromes that usually involve 'anti-GQ1b ganglioside' antibodies. Both syndromes present with ophthalmoplegia and ataxia. However, BBE is differentiated by altered consciousness or pyramidal signs, indicating central nervous system involvement, while MFS is characterized by areflexia, indicative of peripheral nervous system involvement. Here, we discuss a case of an elderly woman who, after an initial episode of an upper respiratory tract infection, developed bilateral ophthalmoplegia, facial and bulbar palsy, ataxia, depressed consciousness, and areflexia. She was clinically diagnosed with a BBE-MFS overlap. However, serology was negative for anti-GQ1b antibodies, and brain imaging and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis were normal. Despite initial clinical deterioration and the need for intubation, she was treated successfully with intravenous immunoglobulin and eventually recovered. This case demonstrates that BBE and MFS can overlap, and that early clinical diagnosis becomes essential even if anti-ganglioside antibodies, CSF, and imaging studies are negative.
