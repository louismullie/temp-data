## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about systolic blood pressure (SBP) diagnosis thresholds, confirmation strategies, and management implications across guidelines and settings. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core diagnostic thresholds used by major societies. Then, I should verify the requirement for repeated measurements and the role of out-of-office monitoring. Next, I will examine special populations and acute care scenarios. After that, I need to consider the risk of over- and underdiagnosis due to variability. Finally, I will synthesize practical, stepwise clinical recommendations and reconcile guideline differences with evidence-based nuance.

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic thresholds so I don't misstate them. The 2017 ACC/AHA guideline defines hypertension as SBP ≥ 130 mmHg and/or DBP ≥ 80 mmHg, with "elevated BP" as 120–129/ < 80 mmHg, which lowered the traditional threshold and expanded the labeled hypertensive population substantially [^115GPRbD] [^112QX74i]. In contrast, the 2018 ESC/ESH guideline retains hypertension at ≥ 140/90 mmHg and uses 130–139/85–89 mmHg as "high-normal", reflecting a more conservative diagnostic bar and different risk framing [^1135yFDZ] [^114GWx56]. Wait, let me verify the 2025 update: the 2025 ACC/AHA guideline continues to endorse a universal office BP goal of < 130/80 mmHg and encourages further SBP reduction toward < 120 mmHg when tolerated, reinforcing the lower threshold framework rather than changing it [^117CAWRS].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about a single elevated reading. I need to ensure we emphasize confirmation. All major guidelines require multiple measurements on separate visits or out-of-office confirmation before diagnosing hypertension, given within-person variability and white-coat effects; typically, two or more elevated office readings on different days or ambulatory/home averages are needed to establish the diagnosis reliably [^113DiYV8] [^111bza7b]. Let me double-check the VA/DoD pathway: if a follow-up clinic BP is ≥ 130/90, they advise diagnosing HTN without further testing, but otherwise they recommend HBPM or ABPM to confirm, which operationalizes the confirmation principle while acknowledging exceptions [^113m5qJB].

> Next, I should review the role of out-of-office monitoring because misclassification is common. ABPM and HBPM improve diagnostic accuracy by revealing white-coat and masked hypertension; ABPM thresholds approximating office 130/80 are around 125/75 mmHg for 24-hour averages, and HBPM around 135/85 mmHg, which helps align office and non-office diagnoses with cardiovascular risk [^1143F69V] [^1135yFDZ]. Wait, let me verify comparative performance: a randomized diagnostic study showed clinic BP had low sensitivity versus ABPM, whereas HBPM aligned closely with ABPM, supporting HBPM's utility for diagnosis when ABPM is not available or feasible [^112ZKt4D]. I should also confirm that guidelines increasingly prefer out-of-office confirmation when feasible to mitigate white-coat effects and variability [^115FLj99].

> I will now examine special populations where thresholds or strategies differ. In older adults, isolated systolic hypertension is prevalent due to arterial stiffness. Both SBP control and careful avoidance of excessive DBP lowering matter, with observational data suggesting harm when DBP falls below about 60 mmHg in patients already at SBP < 130 mmHg, so I need to ensure we don't overcorrect diastole while pursuing systolic targets [^11521VcP] [^115NwPHR]. For children and adolescents, diagnosis requires auscultatory confirmation of BP ≥ 95th percentile on three different visits, with ABPM used to identify white-coat hypertension and guide secondary evaluation when indicated [^115hSH6z] [^1122aPab]. But wait, what about young adults with isolated systolic hypertension? ESH 2023 suggests considering central BP or out-of-office measurements because peripheral SBP may be disproportionately elevated relative to central pressure, and lifestyle modification with surveillance is reasonable while evidence on drug therapy remains limited [^112Qgi2E] [^115yQsni].

> Let me consider acute care settings, because the diagnostic approach changes when BP is severely elevated. In the ED or inpatient setting, a single markedly elevated SBP does not establish chronic hypertension; instead, it should trigger follow-up confirmation and risk stratification, as ED elevations commonly predict sustained hypertension but require outpatient verification before labeling [^113YZ9HF] [^113DqR76]. I should confirm that asymptomatic severe hypertension (≥ 180/ ≥ 110 mmHg) without target-organ damage is managed with oral therapy and close follow-up rather than acute parenteral treatment, which is reserved for hypertensive emergencies with acute organ injury [^1126awxZ] [^112T6Vi2]. Hold on, I should verify ED reproducibility data: multiple ED measurements and reassessment improve specificity for chronic hypertension, supporting the need for structured follow-up rather than immediate diagnosis or aggressive inpatient lowering in the absence of symptoms [^116ycrsY].

> I need to check the implications of variability and the risk of misdiagnosis. Modeling studies show that with ACC/AHA's 130/80 threshold, repeated annual measurements can lead to substantial overdiagnosis of people with true SBP 120–129, whereas ESC/ESH and NICE thresholds reduce overdiagnosis but increase underdiagnosis; this trade-off underscores why confirmation strategies and out-of-office monitoring are critical to avoid unnecessary treatment and labeling [^115cpkYR] [^1177HXWz]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost implied that lower thresholds are inherently harmful; the harm is primarily from misclassification and overtreatment, not the threshold itself, so the solution is better measurement and confirmation rather than rejecting risk-based lower targets outright [^115cpkYR].

> Next, I should review treatment thresholds and targets because diagnosis informs management. For ACC/AHA, drug therapy is recommended at ≥ 140/90 mmHg for all, and at 130–139/80–89 mmHg for high-risk patients (clinical ASCVD, diabetes, CKD, or ≥ 10% 10-year ASCVD risk), with a universal target of < 130/80 mmHg and encouragement to pursue < 120 mmHg when tolerated in selected adults, reflecting SPRINT-era data and updated meta-analyses [^115GPRbD] [^117CAWRS]. Let me verify the European stance: ESC/ESH generally initiate treatment at ≥ 140/90 mmHg and individualize lower targets such as < 130/80 when tolerated, particularly in high-risk patients, aligning with an outcome-driven approach rather than a single universal threshold [^1135yFDZ] [^117JzBNd]. I should double-check VA/DoD targets: they suggest < 130 mmHg SBP for most, with more lenient goals in older adults, illustrating how payer-guideline synthesis can differ from cardiology society positions [^111RryMb].

> I will now synthesize a practical, stepwise diagnostic approach. First, ensure accurate office measurement with proper technique and equipment, then repeat measurements to account for variability. If BP is ≥ 130/80 on at least two occasions, confirm with HBPM or ABPM when feasible to exclude white-coat hypertension and detect masked hypertension before labeling the patient hypertensive [^115GPRbD] [^113DiYV8]. If out-of-office averages are ≥ 130/80 (or ABPM daytime ≥ 135/85), diagnose hypertension; if < 130/80, consider white-coat hypertension and monitor; if office is normal but out-of-office is high, diagnose masked hypertension and initiate therapy based on risk and organ damage [^1143F69V] [^116xZsFU]. Hold on, I should verify that this approach aligns with primary care pathways: VA/DoD explicitly recommends HBPM/ABPM to confirm diagnosis in many scenarios, reinforcing this confirmation-first strategy [^111bza7b].

> Let me reconsider the overarching principle to ensure internal consistency. SBP is the dominant driver of cardiovascular risk, particularly in older adults, and both SBP and DBP contribute independently to events; therefore, diagnostic confirmation should prioritize accurate, repeated, and preferably out-of-office measurements to correctly classify patients and guide risk-based treatment intensity, avoiding both therapeutic inertia and overtreatment from misdiagnosis [^115R8qtu]. I should confirm that this synthesis respects guideline differences: while thresholds vary, all major guidelines converge on rigorous confirmation and risk stratification to operationalize diagnosis and treatment decisions, which is the critical clinical takeaway [^117GgAjo].

SBP diagnosis relies on **≥ 2 elevated office readings** (≥ 130/80 mmHg per ACC/AHA [^115GPRbD]; ≥ 140/90 mmHg per ESC/ESH [^1135yFDZ]) on separate days, or a single elevated out-of-office average (≥ 135/85 mmHg home [^1135yFDZ]; ≥ 130/80 mmHg ambulatory [^1143F69V]). Confirm with **ambulatory or home monitoring** [^112ZKt4D] to reduce misclassification from white-coat or masked hypertension [^116xZsFU]. In emergencies, diagnose hypertensive crisis when SBP ≥ 180 mmHg and/or DBP ≥ 120 mmHg [^113G1JrL], and distinguish emergency (acute target-organ damage) from urgency (no acute damage) to guide urgent care [^113hBaaB].

## Diagnostic thresholds for systolic blood pressure

| **Guideline** | **Hypertension definition (sbp)** | **Elevated bp definition (sbp)** |
|-|-|-|
| ACC/AHA 2017 | ≥ 130 mmHg | 120–129 mmHg |
| ESC/ESH 2018 | ≥ 140 mmHg | 130–139 mmHg (high-normal) |
| VA/DoD 2020 | ≥ 130 mmHg | 120–129 mmHg |

---

These thresholds guide diagnosis and treatment decisions, with ACC/AHA adopting a lower threshold to capture earlier cardiovascular risk [^112QX74i].

---

## Measurement protocols for accurate SBP diagnosis

Accurate SBP diagnosis requires **standardized measurement protocols**:

- **Office measurement**: Use calibrated devices; patient seated 5 minutes; cuff at heart level; average 2–3 readings 1–2 minutes apart [^113DiYV8].
- **Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM)**: Gold standard; provides 24-hour profile; detects white-coat and masked hypertension [^1143F69V].
- **Home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM)**: Convenient; average multiple readings over several days; close agreement with ABPM [^112ZKt4D].

---

## Role of ambulatory and home blood pressure monitoring

ABPM and HBPM are **essential for confirming hypertension** and differentiating white-coat hypertension (elevated office, normal out-of-office) and masked hypertension (normal office, elevated out-of-office) [^116xZsFU]. They improve diagnostic accuracy and guide therapy [^112ZKt4D].

---

## Clinical significance of isolated systolic hypertension (ISH)

ISH (SBP ≥ 130 mmHg, DBP < 80 mmHg) is common in older adults and increases cardiovascular risk [^111dsANr]. It warrants **careful evaluation and management** because of its association with arterial stiffness and cardiovascular events [^111dsANr].

---

## Differentiating hypertensive urgency from hypertensive emergency

Hypertensive urgency is **severely elevated BP (≥ 180/110 mmHg) without acute target-organ damage**, whereas hypertensive emergency is the same BP with acute damage (e.g. encephalopathy, acute heart failure, acute coronary syndrome, acute kidney injury, retinal hemorrhages) [^113hBaaB]. Accurate differentiation guides management: urgency is managed with oral agents and close follow-up, while emergency requires **IV therapy and monitored care** [^112T6Vi2].

---

## Clinical implications of delayed or incorrect SBP diagnosis

Delayed or incorrect SBP diagnosis increases cardiovascular risk, morbidity, and mortality [^notfound]. Early, accurate diagnosis and timely intervention are critical to reduce adverse outcomes [^113hBaaB].

---

## Current guidelines and expert consensus

Current guidelines emphasize:

- **Risk-based approach**: Treat based on cardiovascular risk, comorbidities, and patient characteristics [^115GPRbD].
- **Lower BP targets**: < 130/80 mmHg for most adults; < 120 mmHg if tolerated in high-risk patients [^113vsxev].
- **Individualized care**: Tailor targets to age, comorbidities, and tolerance [^117JzBNd].

---

SBP diagnosis requires **standardized measurement**, confirmation with out-of-office monitoring, and application of guideline thresholds. Accurate diagnosis enables timely intervention and reduces cardiovascular risk [^113DiYV8] [^1135yFDZ] [^111rGUsJ].

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of hypertension in the primary care setting [^117VXvtQ]. VA/DoD (2020). High credibility.

VA/DoD hypertension guideline — Module A: screening and diagnosis — directs that an "Adult in healthcare system" who is currently being treated for HTN proceeds to "Go to Module B, Box 16", while others should "Obtain office blood pressure (see Sidebar 1)". When measured properly, the initial decision is "is SBP ≥ 120 mm Hg or DBP ≥ 80 mm Hg?" If "Yes", assess "Does patient have an acute injury or illness?"; if yes, "Return after acute episode resolved (typically within 4 weeks)" and then "Obtain office blood pressure (see Sidebar 1)"; if no, "Assess the need for and implement lifestyle modification, then follow up for adherence (e.g., diet, exercise, weight loss, alcohol moderation)". If the answer is "No" to "is SBP ≥ 120 mm Hg or DBP ≥ 80 mm Hg?", the pathway is "Screen blood pressure periodically; address other CV risk factors (including healthy diet and physical activity); in patients with known or suspected target organ damage (see Sidebar 3), consider possibility of masked HTN (consider HBPM or ABPM)". From the lifestyle branch, the next decision is "Is SBP ≥ 130 mm Hg or DBP ≥ 90 mm Hg"; if yes, "Confirm diagnosis of HTN by measuring blood pressure after 1–4 weeks (see Sidebar 2); is diagnosis confirmed?" If confirmed, proceed to "Obtain history and physical and assess for target organ damage and comorbid conditions (see Sidebar 3); consider baseline testing (e.g., basic metabolic panel, urinalysis, EKG, A1c, other tests), as appropriate"; if not confirmed, follow the periodic screening and masked HTN consideration pathway.

### The potential for overdiagnosis and underdiagnosis because of blood pressure variability: a comparison of the 2017 ACC / AHA, 2018 ESC / ESH and 2019 NICE hypertension guidelines [^115cpkYR]. Journal of Hypertension (2021). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

The probability that a patient is overdiagnosed with 'hypertension' on the basis of the BP measurements taken, increases with repeated annual blood pressure checks. We estimate that 65–72% of people with a true SBP of 120–129 mmHg will be overdiagnosed after five repeat sets of measurements made using the ACC/AHA guideline recommendations. The proportion of people who are overdiagnosed using the 2018 ESC/ESH or 2019 NICE guidelines is lower, although the risk of underdiagnosis is higher: 17% of people with a true SBP at least 140 mmHg are underdiagnosed after one set of office measurements. However, this proportion can be minimized if the set of office BP measurements is repeated even once, or if just one set of nonoffice measurements are made. Unless a fall in blood pressure can be attributed to another disease (e.g. cardiac failure), then a 'hypertension' diagnosis is usually for life. Once a person is diagnosed with 'hypertension', they do not later become undiagnosed as a result of lower BP measurements, but rather they are said to have 'controlled hypertension'. Thus, where BP measurements are repeated (e.g. at routine check-ups), the cumulative probability of overdiagnosis tends to increase and of underdiagnosis decrease. As well as psychosocial harms caused by the disease label, overdiagnosis of 'hypertension' may cause physical harm where there is also overtreatment, with the potential for adverse effects from unnecessary BP-lowering drugs.

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the evaluation and management of adult patients with asymptomatic hypertension in the emergency department [^115FtkFT]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2006). Medium credibility.

Emergency department (ED) elevated blood pressure without prior diagnosis — prospective cohort follow-up found that 407 patients with elevated blood pressure measurement in the ED and no previous diagnosis of hypertension were classified according to JNC criteria (stage I, II, or III) and prospectively followed; the proportion of patients with at least 1 abnormal measurement in follow-up increased with increasing stage of initial blood pressure and pain as a chief complaint was unrelated to likelihood of having an elevated blood pressure in follow-up; only 65% of patients had repeat blood pressure measurements at follow-up and the authors concluded that patients with a single elevated blood pressure measurement in the ED are at risk for diagnosis of primary hypertension and should be referred for follow-up evaluations.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of hypertension in the primary care setting [^113m5qJB]. VA/DoD (2020). High credibility.

Hypertension diagnosis confirmation — if the follow-up clinic blood pressure value is ≥ 130 mm Hg systolic blood pressure (SBP) or ≥ 90 mm Hg diastolic blood pressure (DBP), the guidance is to make diagnosis of HTN without further testing. In select patients, consider home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM) or ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) to inform the diagnosis, and when blood pressure is < 130 mm Hg SBP and < 90 mm Hg DBP with evidence of target organ damage suggesting possible masked HTN, consider HBPM or ABPM to inform the diagnosis.

### Relationship of blood pressure, health behaviors, and new diagnosis and control of hypertension in the BP-CHECK study [^114EPfsn]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Undiagnosed hypertension and uncontrolled blood pressure (BP) are common and contribute to excess cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. We examined whether BP control, changes in BP, and patient behaviors and attitudes were associated with a new hypertension diagnosis.

Methods

We performed a post hoc analysis of 323 participants from BP-CHECK (Blood Pressure Checks for Diagnosing Hypertension), a randomized diagnostic study of BP measuring methods in adults without diagnosed hypertension with elevated BP recruited from 12 primary care clinics of an integrated health care system in Washington State during 2017 to 2019. All 323 participants returned a positive diagnostic test for hypertension based on 24-hour ambulatory BP monitoring and were followed for 6 months. We used linear regression to examine the relationships between a new hypertension diagnosis (primary independent variable) and differences in the change in study outcomes from baseline to 6-month.

Results

Mean age of study participants was 58.3 years (SD, 13.1), 147 (45%) were women, and 253 (80%) were of non-Hispanic White race. At 6 months, 154 of 323 (48%) participants had a new hypertension diagnosis of whom 88 achieved target BP control. Participants with a new hypertension diagnosis experienced significantly larger declines from baseline in BP (adjusted mean difference: systolic BP, -7.6 mmHg [95% CI, -10.3 to -4.8]; diastolic BP, -3.8 mmHg [95% CI, -5.6 to -2.0]) compared with undiagnosed peers. They were also significantly more likely to achieve BP control by 6 months compared with undiagnosed participants (adjusted relative risk, 1.5 [95% CI, 1.1 to 2.0]). At 6 months, 101 of 323 participants (31%) with a positive ambulatory BP monitoring diagnostic test remained with undiagnosed hypertension, uncontrolled BP, and no antihypertensive medications.

Conclusions

Approximately one-third of participants with high BP on screening and ambulatory BP monitoring diagnostic testing remained with undiagnosed hypertension, uncontrolled BP, and no antihypertensive medications after 6 months. New strategies are needed to enhance integration of BP diagnostic testing into clinical practice.

### Optimal systolic blood pressure target, time to intensification, and time to follow-up in treatment of hypertension: population based retrospective cohort study [^1158rLsq]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

Study measurements

Patients' baseline characteristics and pre-existing medical conditions were assessed during the run-in period. The run-in period began on the clinic registration date and ended on the later date of 12 months after clinic registration or the first documentation of a hypertension related diagnosis code or systolic blood pressure of 130 mm Hg or above.

We defined a treatment strategy assessment period for each patient, which consisted of the first 10 years after the end of the run-in period. During the treatment strategy assessment period, we defined the minimum intensification threshold as the lowest systolic blood pressure at which antihypertensive medication intensification occurred (out of all known intensification events), rounded down to the nearest 10 mm Hg. For instance, for a patient who had antihypertensive medication additions or dose increases at blood pressures of 167, 145, and 155 mm Hg, we would assume that the physician was targeting a blood pressure goal of 140 mm Hg. This approach allowed us to represent the patient's treatment as a single summary, as is the standard approach in cohort studies. We defined antihypertensive medication intensifications as the start of a new antihypertensive medication (complete list in supplementary table B) or an increase in the daily dose of an existing antihypertensive medication, on a date on which blood pressure was measured. Medication adjustments made when systolic blood pressure was already lower than 130 mm Hg are unlikely to represent antihypertensive medication intensifications, so we excluded them from the analysis to minimize confounding from secondary indications for these medications (angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors prescribed for patients with diabetes and renal failure, for instance).

We defined time to intensification as the mean length of unintensified hypertensive periods; each hypertensive period started on the day when systolic blood pressure was first measured to be above the minimum intensification threshold and ended on the first subsequent day when medications were intensified or when the unintensified period was censored (for example, systolic blood pressure fell below the threshold). Transient blood pressure elevations, defined by a single elevated blood pressure measurement above the intensification threshold that fell below the threshold at the next blood pressure reading in the absence of medication intensification, were excluded from the analysis. We defined time to follow-up as the mean time between each medication intensification and the next visit at which blood pressure was recorded.

We defined time to outcome as the time elapsed between the end of the treatment strategy assessment period and the composite outcome, which we defined as a first acute cardiovascular event (myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, acute congestive heart failure episode, or peripheral vascular disease) or death (supplementary table C).

### Prevention, detection, evaluation, and management of high blood pressure in adults: synopsis of the 2017 American college of cardiology / American Heart Association hypertension guideline [^116VRena]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Description

In November 2017, the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and the American Heart Association (AHA) released a clinical practice guideline for the prevention, detection, evaluation, and treatment of high blood pressure (BP) in adults. This article summarizes the major recommendations.

Methods

In 2014, the ACC and the AHA appointed a multidisciplinary committee to update previous reports of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure. The committee reviewed literature and commissioned systematic reviews and meta-analyses on out-of-office BP monitoring, the optimal target for BP lowering, the comparative benefits and harms of different classes of antihypertensive agents, and the comparative benefits and harms of initiating therapy with a single antihypertensive agent or a combination of 2 agents.

Recommendations

This article summarizes key recommendations in the following areas: BP classification, BP measurement, screening for secondary hypertension, nonpharmacologic therapy, BP thresholds and cardiac risk estimation to guide drug treatment, treatment goals (general and for patients with diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, and advanced age), choice of initial drug therapy, resistant hypertension, and strategies to improve hypertension control.

### 2018 ESC / ESH guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension [^113DiYV8]. European Heart Journal (2018). Medium credibility.

ESC/ESH 2018 hypertension — diagnosis of hypertension should be based on repeated office BP across visits with specific measurement procedures, or out‑of‑office monitoring when feasible. Repeated office BP should include three measurements per visit taken 1–2 min apart, perform additional measurements if the first two differ by > 10 mmHg, and average the last two readings; alternatively, diagnosis can use ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) and/or home BP monitoring (HBPM) if logistically and economically feasible.

Demographic Characteristics and Age-Adjusted Mean Blood Pressure of Patients With a Computed Hypertension Diagnosis

Abbreviations: BP, blood pressure; COPD, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; DBP, diastolic blood pressure; SBP, systolic blood pressure.

The number of outpatient and primary care visits across diagnostic timing groups are presented in Table 2. Before the second elevated BP reading, the median number of outpatient and primary care visits was similar between the early-diagnosis and delayed-diagnosis groups (8 [IQR, 3–17] vs 7 [IQR, 3–15] visits). After the second elevated BP reading, substantial health care use persisted among patients with delayed diagnoses. The median number of outpatient visits increased with longer diagnostic delays, ranging from 2 (IQR, 1–3) among those who received a diagnosis within 1 to 90 days to 4 (IQR, 2–8) among those who received a diagnosis within 91 to 365 days and 14 (IQR, 6–28) among those who received a diagnosis more than 365 days after the second BP elevation. A similar pattern was observed for primary care visits.

### Albumin infusion for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis… [^116x5bju]. AAFP (2022). Medium credibility.

Details for This Review Study Population: 288 patients with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis from four randomized controlled trials Efficacy End Points: Renal impairment and mortality Harm End Points: Not reported. Narrative: SBP is a potentially deadly complication of ascites in patients with cirrhosis, with mortality approaching 30%. 1, 2 Patients with cirrhosis and ascites are immunocompromised, and SBP can cause the release of proinflammatory mediators such as cytokines and nitric oxide within the bloodstream and ascitic fluid, which can lead to hypotension. Cirrhosis and ascites also result in splanchnic vasodilation, which can decrease the effective arterial volume and activate the sympathetic nervous system and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. 2, 3 This can contribute to renal impairment, which occurs in 30% to 40% of patients with SBP and is the strongest predictor of mortality in these patients. 2–7.

13 The diagnosis of SBP was based on ascitic fluid polymorphonuclear cell counts of greater than 250 cells per mm³ in three trials and 250 cells per mm³ or greater in one trial. All patients received antibiotics. Albumin was compared with no albumin or artificial colloid. Only one trial was blinded, 10 and one trial used a coin flip for randomization. 14 There were also several sources of heterogeneity. Antibiotic type and dosing differed among trials, although all were accepted SBP regimens. All studies used albumin 20% infusion, but dosing regimens and duration varied. The length of follow-up was unspecified in three trials; one trial followed patients for 90 days. The meta-analysis was funded by a company that makes albumin. Conclusion: This meta-analysis found that albumin infusion decreases the risk of renal impairment and mortality in patients with SBP and no demonstrated renal or hepatic impairment.

Based on this evidence, we have assigned a color recommendation of green for the use of albumin infusion in these patients. However, the low quality of evidence and lack of reporting of harms warrant caution in interpreting the results. Further high-quality data are needed to confirm the benefits and evaluate the harms of this intervention.

### Case-based applications of the 2025 AHA / ACC / multispecialty high blood pressure guideline [^111Uraa4]. Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

Hypertension affects nearly half of all adults in the United States and is the leading, preventable cause of cardiovascular disease worldwide. The American Heart Association, American College of Cardiology, and 11 other professional organizations recently published an updated 2025 guideline to reflect the latest advances in the prevention, detection, evaluation, and management of high blood pressure. To bridge the gap between this guideline update and individualized patient care, this Special Article presents 4 hypothetical cases of high blood pressure, focusing on management in the outpatient setting. These cases illustrate how to apply a risk-based approach to high blood pressure management that incorporates blood pressure levels, cardiovascular disease risk factors and the predicting risk of cardiovascular disease events cardiovascular disease equations. They also highlight notable updates in the 2025 guideline such as recommendations for lifestyle approaches, initiation of medications, blood pressure goals, primary aldosteronism screening, and management of high blood pressure before, during and after pregnancy. By contextualizing the 2025 guideline within these hypothetical case scenarios, this Special Article provides practical guidance to health care teams to offer the most up-to-date, evidence-based care of high blood pressure.

Quality Payment Program (QPP) measure QPP317 — Preventive Care and Screening: Screening for High Blood Pressure and Follow-Up Documented — defines performance as the "Percentage of patients aged ≥ 18 years seen during the submitting period who were screened for elevated blood pressure AND a recommended follow-up plan is documented based on the current blood pressure reading as indicated", with data of interest specifying "Patients who were screened for elevated blood pressure AND have a recommended followup plan documented, as indicated if the blood pressure is pre – hypertensive or hypertensive" among "All patients aged 18 years and older at the beginning of the measurement period with at least one eligible encounter during the measurement period". Denominator exclusions are "Patient not eligible due to active diagnosis of hypertension", denominator exceptions include "Patient refuses to participate (either blood pressure measurement or follow-up)", "Patient is in an urgent or emergent medical situation where time is of the essence and to delay treatment would jeopardize the patient's health status. This may include but is not limited to severely elevated blood pressure when immediate medical treatment is indicated", and "Documented reason for not screening or recommending a follow-up for high blood pressure", and numerator exclusions are "Not Applicable".

### Current diagnosis and management of hypertensive emergency [^113hBaaB]. Seminars in Dialysis (2006). Low credibility.

The appropriate and timely evaluation and treatment of patients with severely elevated blood pressure is essential to avoid serious adverse outcomes. Most importantly, the distinction between a hypertensive emergency (crisis) and urgency needs to be made. A sudden elevation in systolic (SBP) and/or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) that is associated with acute end organ damage (cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, or renal) is defined as a hypertensive crisis or emergency. In contrast, acute elevation in SBP and/or DBP not associated with evidence of end organ damage is defined as hypertensive urgency. In patients with a hypertensive emergency, blood pressure control should be attained as expeditiously as possible with parenteral medications to prevent ongoing and potentially permanent end organ damage. In contrast, with hypertensive urgency, blood pressure control can be achieved with the use of oral medications within 24–48 hours. This paper reviews the management of hypertensive emergencies.

### The potential for overdiagnosis and underdiagnosis because of blood pressure variability: a comparison of the 2017 ACC / AHA, 2018 ESC / ESH and 2019 NICE hypertension guidelines [^11563p1A]. Journal of Hypertension (2021). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Overdiagnosis causes well people to be labelled as abnormal or diseased with possible adverse psychosocial and financial consequences, and usually results in overtreatment with possible physical harms. It may occur because of overdetection because of increased sensitivity of a new test, and/or overdefinition because of expanded definition of disease (including lowered thresholds). A recent example of overdefinition is the expanded definition of 'Hypertension' by the 2017 ACC/AHA high BP Guideline to include 46% of the adult population, by lowering the diagnostic threshold from 140/90 to 130/80 mmHg. Most of the newly classified are unlikely to benefit from their diagnosis in terms of cardiovascular disease prevention, but may be harmed as a result of disease labelling, adverse drug effects or having to now declare a pre-existing "disease" to organisations, such as insurance companies.

The 2017 ACC/AHA guideline recommends averaging at least two office measurements before making a diagnosis of 'hypertension' on an individual patient, and ideally confirming this diagnosis by then averaging multiple out-of-office measurements (Table 1). The guideline's emphasis on accurate measurement technique, both in office and at home, has been commended and some have suggested that this may prevent overdiagnosis of 'hypertension' in individual patients. However, lowering the diagnostic threshold to a level close to the population average means that measurement variability, even if reduced by averaging multiple measurements, may have a large clinical impact. This can happen as the large proportion of adults who have a SBP just below the new diagnostic threshold may have an average that still tips them over the threshold and results in a 'hypertension' label.

### Association of elevated blood pressure in the emergency department with chronically elevated blood pressure [^114GP8dj]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

We therefore evaluated the relationship between ED systolic BP (SBP) and the risk of having mean SBP ≥ 140 mm Hg in the subsequent year after the ED visit, after accounting for multiple patient demographic and clinical conditions, including an existing diagnosis of hypertension, ED disposition, and pain‐related ED chief complaint. Diastolic BP (DBP), alternative post‐ED BP thresholds, different time intervals of post‐ED follow‐up (within 6 months and months 4–12 after the ED visit), and stratification by diagnosed hypertension were examined in secondary and sensitivity analyses.

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the evaluation and management of adult patients with asymptomatic hypertension in the emergency department [^116bL3ZM]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2006). Medium credibility.

Emergency department (ED) elevated blood pressure reproducibility — "Backer et al8 followed 407 ED patients with elevated blood pressure and no previous diagnosis of hypertension", and "The investigators found that the proportion of patients with at least 1 elevated blood pressure measurement in follow-up increased with increasing stage of initial blood pressure". In another cohort, "Chernow et al9 prospectively identified 239 patients with systolic blood pressures greater than 159 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressures greater than 94 mm Hg", and "Of those patients referred for follow-up, 35% were found to be hypertensive, 33% had borderline hypertension, and 32% had normal blood pressure readings on follow-up". Additionally, "Slater et al10 also demonstrated a correlation between elevated blood pressure in the emergency setting and elevated blood pressure in follow-up".

### Consensus statement on the definition of orthostatic hypertension endorsed by the American autonomic society and the Japanese society of hypertension [^113gBUb7]. Hypertension Research (2023). Medium credibility.

We propose a consensus definition of "an exaggerated orthostatic pressor response" in subjects in whom systolic blood pressure increases ≥ 20mmHg when going from the supine to standing posture. This definition can be extended for seated to standing measurements. We reserve the term "orthostatic hypertension" if this pressor response leads to an upright systolic blood pressure ≥ 140mmHg. We believe this consensus definition will help in the study of the pathophysiology, clinical impact, and potential treatment of these entities, and the identification of patients that are at greater cardiovascular risk.

### Does this child with high blood pressure have secondary hypertension? the rational clinical examination systematic review [^111XUK9E]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Guidelines recommend that all children and adolescents with hypertension undergo evaluation for secondary causes. Identifying clinical factors associated with secondary hypertension may decrease unnecessary testing for those with primary hypertension.

Objective

To determine the utility of the clinical history, physical examination, and 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring for differentiating primary hypertension from secondary hypertension in children and adolescents (aged ≤ 21 years).

Data Sources and Study Selection

The databases of MEDLINE, PubMed Central, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library were searched from inception to January 2022 without language limits. Two authors identified studies describing clinical characteristics in children and adolescents with primary and secondary hypertension.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

For each clinical finding in each study, a 2×2 table was created that included the number of patients with and without the finding who had primary vs secondary hypertension. Risk of bias was assessed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies tool.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Random-effects modeling was used to calculate sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios (LRs).

Results

Of 3254 unique titles and abstracts screened, 30 studies met inclusion criteria for the meta-analysis and 23 (N = 4210 children and adolescents) were used for pooling in the meta-analysis. In the 3 studies conducted at primary care clinics or school-based screening clinics, the prevalence of secondary hypertension was 9.0% (95% CI, 4.5%-15.0%). In the 20 studies conducted at subspecialty clinics, the prevalence of secondary hypertension was 44% (95% CI, 36%-53%). The demographic findings most strongly associated with secondary hypertension were family history of secondary hypertension (sensitivity, 0.46; specificity, 0.90; LR, 4.7 [95% CI, 2.9–7.6]), weight in the 10th percentile or lower for age and sex (sensitivity, 0.27; specificity, 0.94; LR, 4.5 [95% CI, 1.2–18]), history of prematurity (sensitivity range, 0.17–0.33; specificity range, 0.86–0.94; LR range, 2.3–2.8), and age of 6 years or younger (sensitivity range, 0.25–0.36; specificity range, 0.86–0.88; LR range, 2.2–2.6). Laboratory studies most associated with secondary hypertension were microalbuminuria (sensitivity, 0.13; specificity, 0.99; LR, 13 [95% CI, 3.1–53]) and serum uric acid concentration of 5.5 mg/dL or lower (sensitivity range, 0.70–0.73; specificity range, 0.65–0.89; LR range, 2.1–6.3). Increased daytime diastolic blood pressure load combined with increased nocturnal systolic blood pressure load on 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring was associated with secondary hypertension (sensitivity, 0.40; specificity, 0.82; LR, 4.8 [95% CI, 1.2–20]). Findings associated with a decreased likelihood of secondary hypertension were asymptomatic presentation (LR range, 0.19–0.36), obesity (LR, 0.34 [95% CI, 0.13–0.90]), and family history of any hypertension (LR, 0.42 [95% CI, 0.30–0.57]). Hypertension stage, headache, and left ventricular hypertrophy did not distinguish secondary from primary hypertension.

Conclusions and Relevance

Family history of secondary hypertension, younger age, lower body weight, and increased blood pressure load using 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring were associated with a higher likelihood of secondary hypertension. No individual sign or symptom definitively differentiates secondary hypertension from primary hypertension.

### Blood pressure targets for the treatment of people with hypertension and cardiovascular disease [^115xdVCE]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

This is the third update of the review first published in 2017. Hypertension is a prominent preventable cause of premature morbidity and mortality. People with hypertension and established cardiovascular disease are at particularly high risk, so reducing blood pressure to below standard targets may be beneficial. This strategy could reduce cardiovascular mortality and morbidity but could also increase adverse events. The optimal blood pressure target in people with hypertension and established cardiovascular disease remains unknown.

Objectives

To determine if lower blood pressure targets (systolic/diastolic 135/85 mmHg or less) are associated with reduction in mortality and morbidity compared with standard blood pressure targets (140 mmHg to 160mmHg/90 mmHg to 100 mmHg or less) in the treatment of people with hypertension and a history of cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction, angina, stroke, peripheral vascular occlusive disease).

Search Methods

For this updated review, we used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. The latest search date was January 2022. We applied no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with more than 50 participants per group that provided at least six months' follow-up. Trial reports had to present data for at least one primary outcome (total mortality, serious adverse events, total cardiovascular events, cardiovascular mortality). Eligible interventions involved lower targets for systolic/diastolic blood pressure (135/85 mmHg or less) compared with standard targets for blood pressure (140 mmHg to 160 mmHg/90 mmHg to 100 mmHg or less). Participants were adults with documented hypertension and adults receiving treatment for hypertension with a cardiovascular history for myocardial infarction, stroke, chronic peripheral vascular occlusive disease, or angina pectoris.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence.

Main Results

We included seven RCTs that involved 9595 participants. Mean follow-up was 3.7 years (range 1.0 to 4.7 years). Six of seven RCTs provided individual participant data. None of the included studies was blinded to participants or clinicians because of the need to titrate antihypertensive drugs to reach a specific blood pressure goal. However, an independent committee blinded to group allocation assessed clinical events in all trials. Hence, we assessed all trials at high risk of performance bias and low risk of detection bias. We also considered other issues, such as early termination of studies and subgroups of participants not predefined, to downgrade the certainty of the evidence. We found there is probably little to no difference in total mortality (risk ratio (RR) 1.05, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.91 to 1.23; 7 studies, 9595 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) or cardiovascular mortality (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.29; 6 studies, 9484 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Similarly, we found there may be little to no differences in serious adverse events (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.08; 7 studies, 9595 participants; low-certainty evidence) or total cardiovascular events (including myocardial infarction, stroke, sudden death, hospitalization, or death from congestive heart failure (CHF)) (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.00; 7 studies, 9595 participants; low-certainty evidence). The evidence was very uncertain about withdrawals due to adverse effects. However, studies suggest more participants may withdraw due to adverse effects in the lower target group (RR 8.16, 95% CI 2.06 to 32.28; 3 studies, 801 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Systolic and diastolic blood pressure readings were lower in the lower target group (systolic: mean difference (MD) -8.77 mmHg, 95% CI -12.82 to -4.73; 7 studies, 8657 participants; diastolic: MD -4.50 mmHg, 95% CI -6.35 to -2.65; 6 studies, 8546 participants). More drugs were needed in the lower target group (MD 0.56, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.96; 5 studies, 7910 participants), but blood pressure targets at one year were achieved more frequently in the standard target group (RR 1.20, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.23; 7 studies, 8699 participants).

Authors' Conclusions

We found there is probably little to no difference in total mortality and cardiovascular mortality between people with hypertension and cardiovascular disease treated to a lower compared to a standard blood pressure target. There may also be little to no difference in serious adverse events or total cardiovascular events. This suggests that no net health benefit is derived from a lower systolic blood pressure target. We found very limited evidence on withdrawals due to adverse effects, which led to high uncertainty. At present, evidence is insufficient to justify lower blood pressure targets (135/85 mmHg or less) in people with hypertension and established cardiovascular disease. Several trials are still ongoing, which may provide an important input to this topic in the near future.

The Effect of systolic and diastolic blood pressure on cardiovascular outcomes

High SBP and DBP associate with increased CV events. However, it remained unclear whether either SBP or DBP carries more prognostic information. This question was addressed in a study, which evaluated data from an integrated health care delivery system in the US. Between 2007 and 2016, more than 36 million office BP measurements were analyzed from around 1.3 million people. The study confirmed that both SBP and DBP increased the risk of CV events such as myocardial infarction and stroke. A continuous burden of SBP (≥ 140 mmHg; hazard ratio (HR) per unit increase in z score, 1.18; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.17 to 1.18) and DBP (≥ 90 mmHg; HR per unit increase in z score, 1.06; 95% CI, 1.06 to 1.07) independently predicted the composite outcome. A J-curve relationship between DBP and the composite outcome was detected. Elevated SBP had a greater prognostic effect on stroke and myocardial infarction (Fig. 1). However, DBP influenced the prognosis independently of SBP.

Fig. 1
The effect of systolic and diastolic blood pressure on cardiovascular outcomes.

The relationship between systolic blood pressure (solid line) and diastolic blood pressure (dashed line) z scores and the risk of the composite outcome among participants with systolic blood pressure > 133 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure > 78 mmHg are shown.

The 2017 American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association Guidelines on the management of hypertension revised the definition of hypertension, which has been defined as > 130/ > 80 mmHg. Contrary, in the 2018 European Guidelines, the definition remained unchanged (> 140/ > 90 mmHg). Against this background, the prevalence of hypertension according to the different definition criteria were analyzed. The prevalence of hypertension increased from 18.9% with a threshold of > 140/90 mmHg to 43.5% with > 130/80 mmHg. An SBP of > 130 mmHg was present in almost 50% of the participants over the age of 60 years (Fig. 2).

Prevalence of systolic blood pressure ≥ 130 or ≥ 140 mmHg depending on age.

Systolic blood pressure measurements indicating hypertension (systolic blood pressure ≥ 130 mmHg or ≥ 140 mmHg) increased as a function of age.

### Potential impact of 2017 American college of cardiology / American Heart Association hypertension guideline on contemporary practice: a cross-sectional analysis from NCDR PINNACLE registry [^113vsxev]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

The 2017 American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) Guideline for the Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Management of High Blood Pressure in Adultsprovides blood pressure (BP) thresholds for the diagnosis of hypertension, initiation of antihypertensive treatment, and targets for BP control. Compared with recommendations from the 2014 report from the expert panel, composed of members appointed to the intended Eighth Joint National Committeeand the 2003 Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC7), notable differences in definitions exist (Table 1).

Table 1
BP Levels to Define Hypertension, Recommend Antihypertensive Therapy, and Provide Treatment Goals, According to the ACC/AHA Guideline, 2014 Expert Panel Report, and JNC7

First, the ACC/AHA guideline uses a lower systolic and diastolic BP threshold of 130/80 mm Hg to define hypertension, compared with 140/90 mm Hg used by the previous 2014 expert panel report and JNC7. Although all 3 documents recommend the use of antihypertensive therapy in those with a BP ≥ 140/90 mm Hg, the most recent guideline also recommends therapy for individuals with a BP ≥ 130/80 mm Hg and either a 10‐year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk ≥ 10% or high‐risk comorbidities (ischemic heart disease, heart failure [HF], diabetes, or chronic kidney disease). Based in part on data from SPRINT (Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial), the 2017 ACC/AHA guideline recommends a more aggressive BP target of < 130/80 mm Hg in all adults. In contrast, the 2014 expert panel report recommends a goal of < 140/90 mm Hg for all except those aged > 60 years, for whom a target of < 150/90 mm Hg is recommended. Similarly, the JNC7 set a BP goal of < 140/90 mm Hg for the general population, reserving a more intensive goal of < 130/80 mm Hg for those with diabetes or chronic kidney disease.

### Diagnostic of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis… [^1166Wr96]. ClinicalTrials (2010). Low credibility.

Diagnostic of Spontaneous Bacterial PeritonitisClinicalTrials. gov ID Study Overview Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, an infection of ascitic fluid in the absence of localized intra-abdominal infection, is one of the main potentially fatal complications of cirrhosis. In the case of SBP, early diagnosis and rapid therapeutic care can improve patient survival. The diagnosis of SBP is based on the detection of a polymorphonuclear neutrophils count equal to or greater than 250 /mm³ in the ascitic fluid. However, obtaining an ascitic cell count is sometimes difficult because it can not always be performed in emergency especially outside the opening hours of the laboratory of Bacteriology. This raises the necessity of developing quick and easy alternative approaches of diagnosis. Few groups have proposed the use of urinary reagent strip for rapid diagnosis of SBP.

Nevertheless, the investigators clinical teams have shown that the sensitivity of this test was low in a large national multicenter prospective study involving more than a thousand patients. The use of Multistix strips test is thus not recommended for the routine application of diagnosis of SBP due to its lack of sensitivity. Although performed on small groups of patients, several studies have reported that IL-8 or IL-6 might be used as markers of ascitic fluid infections. Based on these data and confirmed by the investigators preliminary results the investigators propose to study on a broad recruitment of patients estimated to about 500 inclusions the interest of using IL-8 and IL-6 as predictive markers of SBP. The investigators therefore propose a diagnostic study, non-interventional, prospective, multicenter trial conducted over 2 years.
- The main objective is to establish the diagnostic performance of IL-8 and IL-6, assayed in the ascites fluid by an automated ELISA in the early diagnosis of SBP.
- The secondary objectives are to confirm the interest of the measurement of leptin in the SBP and to establish the diagnostic performance of IL-8 and IL-6 or leptin according to different clinical features in patients.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of hypertension in the primary care setting [^116a8F5y]. VA/DoD (2020). High credibility.

Systolic blood pressure target less than 130 mm Hg — evidence gap and ongoing trials: Additional RCTs would be needed to definitively recommend an SBP target of less than 130 mm Hg. Given the results of SPRINT, such a large clinical trial is unlikely to be performed in the U.S. in a general (lower risk) hypertensive population. In hypertension patients with diabetes, additional data from RCTs may be available in the next few years as two large trials, Blood Pressure Control Target in Diabetes (BPROAD) and Intervention for High-normal or Borderline-elevated Blood Pressure in Adults with Type 2 Diabetes (IPAD) are currently enrolling in China, and these trials should provide further evidence for the benefit of specific SBP thresholds and goals in patients with diabetes.

### Blood pressure targets for the treatment of people with hypertension and cardiovascular disease [^1135WgQD]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Hypertension is a prominent preventable cause of premature morbidity and mortality. People with hypertension and established cardiovascular disease are at particularly high risk, so reducing blood pressure below standard targets may be beneficial. This strategy could reduce cardiovascular mortality and morbidity but could also increase adverse events. The optimal blood pressure target in people with hypertension and established cardiovascular disease remains unknown.

Objectives

To determine if 'lower' blood pressure targets (≤ 135/85 mmHg) are associated with reduction in mortality and morbidity as compared with 'standard' blood pressure targets (≤ 140 to 160/ 90 to 100 mmHg) in the treatment of people with hypertension and a history of cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction, angina, stroke, peripheral vascular occlusive disease).

Search Methods

The Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomized controlled trials up to February 2017: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials.gov. We also searched the Latin American and Caribbean Health Science Literature Database (from 1982) and contacted authors of relevant papers regarding further published and unpublished work. There were no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with more than 50 participants per group and at least six months follow-up. Trial reports needed to present data for at least one primary outcome (total mortality, serious adverse events, total cardiovascular events, cardiovascular mortality). Eligible interventions were lower target for systolic/diastolic blood pressure (≤ 135/85 mmHg) compared with standard target for blood pressure (≤ 140 to 160/90 to 100 mmHg). Participants were adults with documented hypertension or who were receiving treatment for hypertension and cardiovascular history for myocardial infarction, stroke, chronic peripheral vascular occlusive disease or angina pectoris.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed search results and extracted data using standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration.

Main Results

We included six RCTs that involved a total of 9795 participants. Mean follow-up was 3.7 years (range 1.0 to 4.7 years). Five RCTs provided individual patient data for 6775 participants. We found no change in total mortality (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.22) or cardiovascular mortality (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.21; moderate-quality evidence). Similarly, no differences were found in serious adverse events (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.11; low-quality evidence). There was a reduction in fatal and non fatal cardiovascular events (including myocardial infarction, stroke, sudden death, hospitalization or death from congestive heart failure) with the lower target (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.78 to 0.98; ARR 1.6% over 3.7 years; low-quality evidence). There were more participant withdrawals due to adverse effects in the lower target arm (RR 8.16, 95% CI 2.06 to 32.28; very low-quality evidence). Blood pressures were lower in the lower' target group by 9.5/4.9 mmHg. More drugs were needed in the lower target group but blood pressure targets were achieved more frequently in the standard target group.

Authors' Conclusions

No evidence of a difference in total mortality and serious adverse events was found between treating to a lower or to a standard blood pressure target in people with hypertension and cardiovascular disease. This suggests no net health benefit from a lower systolic blood pressure target despite the small absolute reduction in total cardiovascular serious adverse events. There was very limited evidence on adverse events, which lead to high uncertainty. At present there is insufficient evidence to justify lower blood pressure targets (≤ 135/85 mmHg) in people with hypertension and established cardiovascular disease. More trials are needed to answer this question.

### Differing prevalence estimates of elevated blood pressure in ED patients using 4 methods of categorization [^115Mj5FM]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

This study examined the variability of blood pressure measurements and prevalence estimates of elevated blood pressure in emergency department (ED) patients using 4 different methods of categorization.

Methods

A prospective, observational study was conducted on adult ED patients with elevated triage blood pressures (systolic ≥ 140 or diastolic ≥ 90 mm Hg). Three blood pressure measurements were obtained on all subjects and categorized as follows: (1) triage measurement only, (2) the mean of the triage and second measurement, (3) the mean of the 3 measurements, and (4) the mean of the second and third measurements.

Results

Of 2192 screened patients, 326 were included in the final analysis with mean triage systolic and diastolic blood pressures of 160 and 90 mm Hg, respectively. Prevalence estimates of elevated blood pressure in this sample ranged from 100% (reference standard: mean triage blood pressure) to the most conservative estimate of 67% (fourth method).

Conclusion

Determination of elevated blood pressure in ED patients is largely dependent on the method of blood pressure categorization.

### Clinical practice guideline for screening and management of high blood pressure in children and adolescents [^1122aPab]. Pediatrics (2017). Medium credibility.

White coat hypertension (WCH) — definition, diagnosis, follow-up, and recommendation: WCH is defined as BP ≥ 95th percentile in the office or clinical setting but < 95th percentile outside, and is diagnosed by ABPM when the mean systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) are < 95th percentile and SBP and DBP load are < 25%; it is estimated that up to half of children evaluated for elevated office BP have WCH, and children and adolescents with WCH should have screening BP at regular well-child visits with consideration of a repeat ABPM in 1 to 2 years; furthermore, Key Action Statement 9 specifies that children and adolescents with suspected WCH should undergo ABPM, with diagnosis based on mean SBP and DBP < 95th percentile and SBP and DBP load < 25% (grade B, strong recommendation).

### The management of elevated blood pressure in the acute care setting: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^112T6Vi2]. Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

Over the past 3 decades, a substantial body of high-quality evidence has guided the diagnosis and management of elevated blood pressure (BP) in the outpatient setting. In contrast, there is a lack of comparable evidence for guiding the management of elevated BP in the acute care setting, resulting in significant practice variation. Throughout this scientific statement, we use the terms acute care and inpatient to refer to care received in the emergency department and after admission to the hospital. Elevated inpatient BP is common and can manifest either as asymptomatic or with signs of new or worsening target-organ damage, a condition referred to as hypertensive emergency. Hypertensive emergency involves acute target-organ damage and should be treated swiftly, usually with intravenous antihypertensive medications, in a closely monitored setting. However, the risk-benefit ratio of initiating or intensifying antihypertensive medications for asymptomatic elevated inpatient BP is less clear. Despite this ambiguity, clinicians prescribe oral or intravenous antihypertensive medications in approximately one-third of cases of asymptomatic elevated inpatient BP. Recent observational studies have suggested potential harms associated with treating asymptomatic elevated inpatient BP, which brings current practice into question. Despite the ubiquity of elevated inpatient BPs, few position papers, guidelines, or consensus statements have focused on improving BP management in the acute care setting. Therefore, this scientific statement aims to synthesize the available evidence, provide suggestions for best practice based on the available evidence, identify evidence-based gaps in managing elevated inpatient BP (asymptomatic and hypertensive emergency), and highlight areas requiring further research.

### Clinical practice guideline for screening and management of high blood pressure in children and adolescents [^111SeL3M]. Pediatrics (2017). Medium credibility.

Elevated blood pressure (BP) in children and adolescents — follow-up and evaluation: For an elevated BP level, BP should be rechecked in 6 months by auscultation. If BP continues at the elevated BP level after 12 months (eg, after 3 auscultatory measurements), ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) should be ordered (if available), and diagnostic evaluation should be conducted. Consider subspecialty referral (ie, cardiology or nephrology). If BP normalizes at any point, return to annual BP screening at well-child care visits.

### Impact of 2017 ACC / AHA guidelines on prevalence of hypertension and eligibility for antihypertensive treatment in United States and China: nationally representative cross sectional study [^112QX74i]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

The American College of Cardiology (ACC) and the American Heart Association (AHA) recently released guideline recommendations for treatment strategies for hypertension with lower blood pressure values used to define elevated blood pressure, and lower treatment thresholds, than those recommended in current guidelines. These new guidelines define hypertension as a systolic blood pressure of 130 mm Hg or greater or a diastolic blood pressure of 80 mm Hg or greater, in contrast to a systolic blood pressure of 140 mm Hg or greater or a diastolic blood pressure of 90 mm Hg or greater that was used to define hypertension in all previous guidelines.

Furthermore, treatment recommendations have been extensively revised. The ACC/AHA guidelines recommend treatment of only a subset of patients with a diagnosis of hypertension. This includes all those with a systolic blood pressure of 140 mm Hg or greater or a diastolic blood pressure of 90 mm Hg or greater. Treatment is recommended for additional patients with lower blood pressures. Among people with a systolic blood pressure of 130–139 mm Hg or a diastolic blood pressure of 80–89 mm Hg, treatment is recommended only for those who meet any of the following criteria: aged 65 years or older, pre-existing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease or a 10 year predicated risk of developing it of 10% or greater, chronic kidney disease, or diabetes mellitus. Furthermore, a target systolic blood pressure below 130 mm Hg and a target diastolic blood pressure below 80 mm Hg is recommended for all patients, regardless of their baseline blood pressures. These recommendations contrast with currently suggested systolic blood pressure targets of less than 140 mm Hg and diastolic targets of less than 90 mm Hg for most patients, other than targets of less than 150/90 mm Hg for those aged 60 years or over without concomitant diabetes or chronic kidney disease.

### Hypertension [^1153xnL8]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Recent guidelines on diagnosis and management of high blood pressure (BP) include substantial changes and several new concepts compared with previous guidelines. These are reviewed and their clinical implications are discussed in this article. The goal is to provide a practical reference to assist clinicians with up-to-date management of patients with high BP. Important issues include new diagnostic thresholds, out-of-office BP monitoring, intensified treatment goals, and a different approach to resistant hypertension. Finally, differences among guidelines, the persistent controversies that have led to them, and their implications for clinical practice are discussed.

### Association of systolic and diastolic blood pressure and all cause mortality in people with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes: retrospective cohort study [^112txRs5]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

This observational study was undertaken to relate the levels of systolic and diastolic blood pressure achieved during the first year after diagnosis of diabetes to the risk of all cause mortality in a large cohort of patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes. Our results show that in patients with diabetes and cardiovascular disease, systolic blood pressure below 110 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure below 75 mm Hg were associated with significantly increased risk of death. In patients with diabetes without established cardiovascular disease, systolic blood pressure below 120 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure below 75 mm Hg were associated with a significant increased risk of mortality. These associations persisted when we restricted our analyses to patients who received treatment for hypertension and to those who had a diagnosis of hypertension at baseline.

Comparison with other studies

The risks of elevated blood pressure have been repeatedly demonstrated by clinical and epidemiological studies. Many studies have described a gradual increase in the risk of mortality with increasing levels of systolic and diastolic blood pressure, with no lower thresholds for blood pressure. Despite the known benefits of blood pressure lowering and the effectiveness of medical treatment to reduce blood pressure, the optimal goals of treatment still remain unclear in people with diabetes.

The UKPDS study (an early trial which also looked at people with newly diagnosed diabetes) found that tight lowering of blood pressure markedly reduced the incidence of microvascular and macrovascular endpoints in patients with type 2 diabetes. However, patients assigned to the intensive treatment group (< 150/85 mm Hg) achieved a mean blood pressure of 144/82 mm Hg, and patients assigned to the conventional treatment group achieved 154/87 mm Hg during follow-up. Another early study, the HOT trial, randomised hypertensive patients to receive intensive control of diastolic blood pressure (to ≤ 80 mm Hg) or conventional control (to ≤ 90 mm Hg). A retrospective subgroup analysis showed major reductions in cardiovascular outcomes in patients with diabetes in the intensive treatment group, with an achieved blood pressure of 140/81 mm Hg. Furthermore, the lowest incidence of cardiovascular events occurred at a blood pressure of 138/82 mm Hg. Although these early trials shown the benefits of blood pressure lowering in people with diabetes and changed clinical practice, the achieved blood pressure levels in these studies were considerably higher than the target currently recommended by major guidelines.

### Association of elevated blood pressure in the emergency department with chronically elevated blood pressure [^113XFPpP]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

In summary, when BP is elevated in the ED, there is a high likelihood that BP will remain elevated in the subsequent year, particularly among patients without diagnosed hypertension. Although hospitalization modified the relationship between ED and post‐ED BP, there was no evidence of effect modification by pain‐related ED chief complaint. Improving identification, follow‐up, and optimal ED management of elevated BP measured in the ED is needed.

### Systolic blood pressure targets below 120 mm Hg are associated with reduced mortality: a meta-analysis [^112LtX5Z]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Elevated BP significantly increases CVD risk, yet optimal targets remain debated due to inconsistent outcomes and concerns about side effects. The recent update of the ESC hypertension guidelines from August 2024 considered only three of the five studies incorporated in the present meta‐analysis. Compared with the previous version, which recommended targeting SBP values of 140/90 mm Hg for all patients, with a further target of 130/80 mm Hg or lower if tolerated, the revised guideline now suggests targeting SBP values of 120–129 mm Hg, provided the treatment is well tolerated.

The present study evaluated 5 large, randomized clinical trials and incorporated 39,434 patients. To the best of our knowledge, this meta‐analysis was the first to indicate that targeting an SBP of < 120 mm Hg, compared to less than 140 mm Hg, was associated with a reduced risk of all‐cause mortality, cardiovascular death, and MACE. However, this cardiovascular benefit was accompanied by an increased rate of serious adverse events, including syncope and arrhythmia, due to the lower BP levels achieved.

METHODS

We used the summary statistics from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) of the US adult population aged at least 20 years (noninstitutionalized) who are not taking antihypertensive medication to simulate a distribution of blood pressure measurements for 1 000 000 individuals. Each simulated SBP was taken as the true SBP for an individual (i.e. their true underlying average BP). We then applied estimates of within-person variability (coefficients of variation) to our population of true SBPs in order to generate observed SBPs for five independent sets of measurements, representing an annual assessment of blood pressure over 5 years. Each set of measurements represented: the average of two separate office measurements (taken in duplicate and repeated 6 weeks apart; equivalent to office blood pressure measurement); 1 day of ambulatory measurements (daytime average from 24-h ambulatory monitoring); or 1 week of home measurements (home self-monitoring of blood pressure from 7 days of self-monitoring with replicate measurements taken twice daily and the first day's data discarded, equivalent to home blood pressure measurement). We used estimates of the co-efficient of variation from the largest primary study, derived from a randomized clinical trial of 163 subjects. (Further details of the primary study for the estimates of within person variability are provided in the S1 Appendix.)

We then calculated the cumulative probability that at least one set of BP measurements would be above a threshold (130 mmHg for office/nonoffice measurements as per the 2017 ACC/AHA guideline, or 140 mmHg for office and 135 mmHg for nonoffice measurements as per the 2018 ESC/ESH and 2019 NICE guidelines), and that no set of BP measurements would be above the threshold. We grouped the simulated population by the true SBP (< 120, 120–129, 130–139, ≥ 140 mmHg) to obtain the expected proportion who had at least one or no sets of measurements above the threshold. In this way, we were able to estimate the probability of overdiagnosing hypertension in people who truly have low SBP (where just one set of measurements needs to be randomly high enough to be over the diagnostic threshold), or alternatively the probability of underdiagnosing hypertension in people who truly have elevated SBP (where all sets of measurements are randomly low enough to be under the diagnostic threshold).

The simulations and other calculations were done using SAS 9.4, SAS Institute Inc. Cary, North Carolina, USA.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of hypertension in the primary care setting [^111RryMb]. VA/DoD (2020). High credibility.

VA/DoD hypertension guideline — blood pressure targets by population are stated as follows: For all patients, including those with type 2 diabetes, we suggest treating to a systolic blood pressure goal of < 130 mm Hg. For patients 60 years and over, we recommend treating to a systolic blood pressure goal of < 150 mm Hg with added benefit to lowering systolic blood pressure further for those between 130 mm Hg and 150 mm Hg. For patients 60 years and over with type 2 diabetes, we recommend treating to a systolic blood pressure goal of < 140 mm Hg with added benefit to lowering systolic blood pressure further for those between 130 mm Hg and 140 mm Hg. For patients 30 years and over, we recommend treating to a diastolic blood pressure goal of < 90 mm Hg.

### 2018 ESC / ESH guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension [^115QEbuE]. European Heart Journal (2018). Medium credibility.

ESC/ESH 2018 hypertension — central aortic pressure describes that various techniques allow aortic BP (central BP) to be derived from peripheral BP measurements using dedicated algorithms, and that in hypertensive patients central BP predicts cardiovascular (CV) events with a differential effect of antihypertensive drugs on central compared with brachial BP, although the incremental prognostic value of central vs. conventional clinic BP measurement remains unclear. An exception may be isolated systolic hypertension in the young, in whom peripheral BP may be disproportionately elevated relative to a normal central BP; this occurs in a small fraction of younger people, mainly men with isolated systolic hypertension, and it remains unclear whether such patients are at lower risk than suggested by their brachial office BP.

### Diagnosis, evaluation, and management of high blood pressure in children and adolescents [^1137xiH3]. Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Systemic hypertension is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in adulthood. High blood pressure (HBP) and repeated measures of HBP, hypertension (HTN), begin in youth. Knowledge of how best to diagnose, manage, and treat systemic HTN in children and adolescents is important for primary and subspecialty care providers.

Objectives

To provide a technical summary of the methodology used to generate the 2017 "Clinical Practice Guideline for Screening and Management of High Blood Pressure in Children and Adolescents", an update to the 2004 "Fourth Report on the Diagnosis, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure in Children and Adolescents".

Data Sources

Medline, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Excerpta Medica Database references published between January 2003 and July 2015 followed by an additional search between August 2015 and July 2016.

Study Selection

English-language observational studies and randomized trials.

Methods

Key action statements (KASs) and additional recommendations regarding the diagnosis, management, and treatment of HBP in youth were the product of a detailed systematic review of the literature. A content outline establishing the breadth and depth was followed by the generation of 4 patient, intervention, comparison, outcome, time questions. Key questions addressed: (1) diagnosis of systemic HTN, (2) recommended work-up of systemic HTN, (3) optimal blood pressure (BP) goals, and (4) impact of high BP on indirect markers of cardiovascular disease in youth. Once selected, references were subjected to a 2-person review of the abstract and title followed by a separate 2-person full-text review. Full citation information, population data, findings, benefits and harms of the findings, as well as other key reference information were archived. Selected primary references were then used for KAS generation. Level of evidence (LOE) scoring was assigned for each reference and then in aggregate. Appropriate language was used to generate each KAS based on the LOE and the balance of benefit versus harm of the findings. Topics that could not be researched via the stated approach were (1) definition of HTN in youth, and (2) definition of left ventricular hypertrophy. KASs related to these stated topics were generated via expert opinion.

Results

Nearly 15000 references were identified during an initial literature search. After a deduplication process, 14382 references were available for title and abstract review, and 1379 underwent full text review. One hundred twenty-four experimental and observational studies published between 2003 and 2016 were selected as primary references for KAS generation, followed by an additional 269 primary references selected between August 2015 and July 2016. The LOE for the majority of references was C. In total, 30 KASs and 27 additional recommendations were generated; 12 were related to the diagnosis of HTN, 13 were related to management and additional diagnostic testing, 3 to treatment goals, and 2 to treatment options. Finally, special additions to the clinical practice guideline included creation of new BP tables based on BP values obtained solely from children with normal weight, creation of a simplified table to enhance screening and recognition of abnormal BP, and a revision of the criteria for diagnosing left ventricular hypertrophy.

Conclusions

An extensive and detailed systematic approach was used to generate evidence-based guidelines for the diagnosis, management, and treatment of youth with systemic HTN.

### Underdiagnosis of isolated systolic and isolated diastolic hypertension [^111oXnv6]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Systolic and diastolic hypertension independently predict the risk of adverse cardiovascular events. It remains unclear how systolic pressure, diastolic pressure, and other patient characteristics influence the initial diagnosis of hypertension. Here, we use a cohort of 146,816 adults in a large healthcare system to examine how elevated systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure measurements influence initial diagnosis of hypertension and how other patient characteristics influence the diagnosis. Thirty-four percent of the cohort were diagnosed with hypertension within 1 year. In multivariable logistic regression of the diagnosis of hypertension, controlling for covariates, isolated systolic hypertensive measures (odds ratio [OR] 0.42 [95% confidence interval {CI} 0.41 to 0.43]) and isolated diastolic hypertensive measures (OR 0.32 [95% CI 0.31 to 0.33]) were less likely to lead to hypertension diagnosis when compared with combined hypertensive measures. Higher levels of systolic blood pressure had a greater impact on hypertension diagnosis (OR 1.77 [95% CI 1.75 to 1.79] per Z-score) than did higher levels of diastolic blood pressure (OR 1.34 [95% CI 1.32 to 1.36] per Z-score). Older age, non-white race/ethnicity, and medical comorbidities all predicted the establishment of a diagnosis of hypertension. Isolated systolic and isolated diastolic hypertension are underdiagnosed in clinical practice, and several patient-centered factors also strongly influence whether a diagnosis is made. In conclusion, our findings uncover a care gap that can be closed with increased attention to the independent influence of systolic and diastolic hypertension and the various patient-centered factors that may impact hypertension diagnosis.

### 2018 ESC / ESH guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension [^1135yFDZ]. European Heart Journal (2018). Medium credibility.

ESC/ESH 2018 hypertension — definition and diagnostic confirmation defines hypertension as an office SBP ≥ 140 and/or DBP ≥ 90 mmHg, which is equivalent to a 24 h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) average of ≥ 130/80 mmHg, or a home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM) average ≥ 135/85 mmHg; screening programmes should be established to ensure that BP is measured in all adults at least every 5 years, and the diagnosis of hypertension should be confirmed either by repeated office BP measurements over a number of visits or by out-of-office BP measurement using 24 h ABPM or HBPM.

### Effects of elevated systolic blood pressure on ischemic heart disease: a burden of proof study [^111U2gF8]. Nature Medicine (2022). Excellent credibility.

Main

High SBP is a common modifiable risk factor for IHD. IHD is the leading cause of death and disability worldwide, accounting for an estimated 9.1 million (95% uncertainty interval (UI) = 8.4–9.7 million) deaths, 197 million (178–219) prevalent cases and 182 million (170–194) disability-adjusted life years in 2019.

The association between SBP and IHD is one of the most widely investigated health risk–outcome relationships, with substantial evidence for causation. Prospective cohort studies have reported a continuous log-linear association between usual SBP and mortality due to vascular events across diverse population groups with and without pre-existing cardiovascular disease –. Similarly, double-blinded randomized control trials (RCTs) that examine blood pressure-lowering drugs, and meta-analyses of RCT data have provided evidence of the protective effects of pharmacologically induced blood pressure reduction.

Despite the extensive body of evidence indicating that elevated SBP is related to increased risk of IHD, several questions and methodological challenges remain unaddressed. Trials performed thus far have primarily focused on individuals diagnosed with hypertension or those who are already at high cardiovascular risk, typically involving participants who are known to be at higher levels of risk. Moreover, there are crucial questions about the level at which SBP values should be considered elevated, and whether pharmacological reduction of BP reduces IHD risk even for individuals with relatively low baseline levels –. Conversely there has been discussion of whether reduction of BP below a certain point may actually increase IHD risk, based on the J-shaped SBP–IHD relationship observed in analyses performed in a subset of cohort studies –.

Investigation of SBP as a continuous risk function is helpful in the face of multiple current clinical guidelines for BP that suggest different thresholds for applying diagnoses. The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association 2017 guidelines define normal BP as < 120/80 mm Hg, with elevated BP considered to be SBP of 120–129 mm Hg and hypertension defined as SBP ≥ 130/80 mm Hg. In contrast, the European Society of Cardiology/European Society of Hypertension 2018 guidelines consider normal BP to be < 130/85 mm Hg, with high-normal defined as BP of 130–139/85–89 mm Hg and hypertension defined as ≥ 140 mm Hg. The International Society of Hypertension 2020 guidelines similarly consider hypertension to be BP ≥ 140/90 mm Hg.

### Exercise reduces ambulatory blood pressure in patients with hypertension: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^111j8z39]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Hypertension is the major cause of premature death worldwide, which is associated with an estimated global direct medical cost of $370 billion/year. 1 This condition has been traditionally identified by assessing blood pressure (BP) in a clinical setting (ie, office [or "clinic"] BP) and medical treatment adjusted accordingly. The 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association proposed office BP of ≥ 130/80 mm Hg as a new threshold for diagnosis of hypertension, 2 whereas the 2018 European Society of Cardiology/European Society of Hypertension maintained an office BP threshold of ≥ 140/90 mm Hg to define hypertension, similar to previous guidelines. 3 Yet, monitoring of BP at regular intervals during normal day life (ie, ambulatory BP [ABP]) has emerged as a stronger predictor of cardiovascular disease and mortality, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 with threshold criteria to define hypertension based on 24‐hour ABP set at 125/75 and 130/80 mm Hg in the United States 2 and European guidelines, 3 respectively. Particularly, an increased 24‐hour and nighttime ABP is associated with a high cardiovascular disease risk 9 — even if office BP is apparently well controlled (ie, systolic BP [SBP]/diastolic BP [DBP] < 130/80 mm Hg), leading to a prevalent and especially unfavorable hypertension phenotype, the so‐called "masked uncontrolled hypertension". 10 For this reason, assessment of ABP rather than — or at least together with — office BP is currently proposed for the diagnosis and control of hypertension. 11, 12

### Clinical overview of hypertension and emerging treatment considerations [^115ogRoy]. American Journal of Hypertension (2001). Low credibility.

Managing hypertension is a complex undertaking, where even the definition of the disorder is subject to discussion. Recently, there has been controversy concerning the most appropriate measure to determine health risks associated with hypertension. In the past, diastolic blood pressure (DBP) was the prime measure for defining hypertension, but currently systolic blood pressure (SBP) and pulse pressure have gained favor. Evidence now suggests that all three measures should be considered as part of the hypertensive profile, with the patient's age determining the relative importance of each. Aggressive treatment of hypertension may reduce morbidity and mortality. Data from trials clearly indicate that, for all stages of hypertension, the goal should be a maximum SBP of < 150 mm Hg and a DBP of < 90 mm Hg, with DBP values as low as 70 mm Hg being safe. For individuals with diabetes mellitus, these target values should be even lower — SBP < 140 mm Hg and DBP < 80 mm Hg. As a significant number of deaths attributable to hypertension occur in patients who are not diagnosed as hypertensive but whose blood pressure (BP) is above the optimal level of 120/80 mm Hg, lowering BP levels in this group is recommended as well, with lifestyle modification being first-line therapy. Because controlling BP to < 140/90 mm Hg often requires the use of two or three agents, the tolerability of the entire regimen must be considered. However, with the multitude of antihypertensive drugs currently available, no patient's BP should remain above the 150/90 mm Hg level.

### Clinic, home, and kiosk blood pressure measurements for diagnosing hypertension: a randomized diagnostic study [^112ZKt4D]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The US Preventive Services Task Force recommends blood pressure (BP) measurements using 24-h ambulatory monitoring (ABPM) or home BP monitoring before making a new hypertension diagnosis.

Objective

Compare clinic-, home-, and kiosk-based BP measurement to ABPM for diagnosing hypertension.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Diagnostic study in 12 Washington State primary care centers, with participants aged 18–85 years without diagnosed hypertension or prescribed antihypertensive medications, with elevated BP in clinic.

Interventions

Randomization into one of three diagnostic regimens: (1) clinic (usual care follow-up BPs); (2) home (duplicate BPs twice daily for 5 days); or (3) kiosk (triplicate BPs on 3 days). All participants completed ABPM at 3 weeks.

Main Measures

Primary outcome was difference between ABPM daytime and clinic, home, and kiosk mean systolic BP. Differences in diastolic BP, sensitivity, and specificity were secondary outcomes.

Key Results

Five hundred ten participants (mean age 58.7 years, 80.2% white) with 434 (85.1%) included in primary analyses. Compared to daytime ABPM, adjusted mean differences in systolic BP were clinic (-4.7mmHg [95% confidence interval -7.3, -2.2]; P < .001); home (-0.1mmHg [-1.6, 1.5]; p = 0.92); and kiosk (9.5mmHg [7.5, 11.6]; P < .001). Differences for diastolic BP were clinic (-7.2mmHg [-8.8, -5.5]; P < .001); home (-0.4mmHg [-1.4, 0.7]; p = 0.52); and kiosk (5.0mmHg [3.8, 6.2]; P < .001). Sensitivities for clinic, home, and kiosk compared to ABPM were 31.1% (95% confidence interval, 22.9, 40.6), 82.2% (73.8, 88.4), and 96.0% (90.0, 98.5), and specificities 79.5% (64.0, 89.4), 53.3% (38.9, 67.2), and 28.2% (16.4, 44.1), respectively.

Limitations

Single health care organization and limited race/ethnicity representation.

Conclusions

Compared to ABPM, mean BP was significantly lower for clinic, significantly higher for kiosk, and without significant differences for home. Clinic BP measurements had low sensitivity for detecting hypertension. Findings support utility of home BP monitoring for making a new diagnosis of hypertension.

### Debate on the 2025 guideline for the prevention, detection, evaluation, and management of high blood pressure in adults: new blood pressure targets, lower is better-and possible [^117CAWRS]. Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Joint Committee on Clinical Practice Guidelines has now released the long-awaited 2025 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology/AANP/AAPA/ABC/ACCP/ACPM/AGS/AMA/ASPC/NMA/PCNA/SGIM Guideline for the Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Management of High Blood Pressure in Adults. Since the previous version, which had been in place for 8 years, meta-analyses and several treat-to-target trials investigating lower versus standard blood pressure targets have been published. Based on these, the 2025 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guideline recommends in adults with confirmed hypertension, an office blood pressure goal of < 130/80 mmHg, with encouragement to further reduce systolic blood pressure to < 120 mmHg. Here, we set out why we support these lower blood pressure targets and outline strategies to achieve them.

### Systolic blood pressure targets below 120 mm Hg are associated with reduced mortality: a meta-analysis [^11359p1C]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Elevated blood pressure (BP) is regarded as a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and significantly contributes to morbidity and mortality worldwide. A comprehensive meta‐analysis determined that lowering systolic BP (SBP) by 5 mm Hg, regardless of baseline BP, may decrease the risk of major cardiovascular events by approximately 10%. The recently published 2024 European Society of Hypertension guidelines recommend initially lowering SBP to below 140 mm Hg and diastolic BP (DBP) to below 80 mm Hg. For most patients under 80 years of age, the SBP target is below 130 mm Hg. This recommendation is in line with the recommendations of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association, which also suggest targets of 130/80 mm Hg, especially in patients with increased cardiovascular risk. Although the benefits of reducing BP further to below 120/70 mm Hg remain uncertain, recent evidence suggests that more intensive BP control may offer additional benefits for patients with increased cardiovascular risk.

Large trials investigating the potential benefit of lowering SBP to more intensive targets of less than 120 mm Hg have yielded conflicting results. The SPRINT trial was the first to show that targeting an SBP below 120 mm Hg significantly reduced the incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) and all‐cause mortality compared to a target of less than 140 mm Hg in patients with increased cardiovascular risk. In contrast, the ACCORD trial, which examined this approach in patients with diabetes, failed to demonstrate a significant reduction in MACE. Furthermore, excessively low BP has also been linked to increased rates of cardiovascular events and other adverse outcomes, including hypotension and syncope. Consequently, the optimal BP target remains debated.

Considering recent large randomized controlled trials, we conducted a meta‐analysis evaluating the efficacy and safety of intensive BP control to an SBP lower than 120 mm Hg versus standard BP control to lower than 140 mm Hg in patients with increased cardiovascular risk.

### Blood pressure targets in adults with hypertension [^1148paiZ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

This is the first update of this review first published in 2009. When treating elevated blood pressure, doctors usually try to achieve a blood pressure target. That target is the blood pressure value below which the optimal clinical benefit is supposedly obtained. "The lower the better" approach that guided the treatment of elevated blood pressure for many years was challenged during the last decade due to lack of evidence from randomised trials supporting that strategy. For that reason, the standard blood pressure target in clinical practice during the last years has been less than 140/90 mm Hg for the general population of patients with elevated blood pressure. However, new trials published in recent years have reintroduced the idea of trying to achieve lower blood pressure targets. Therefore, it is important to know whether the benefits outweigh harms when attempting to achieve targets lower than the standard target.

Objectives

The primary objective was to determine if lower blood pressure targets (any target less than or equal to 135/85 mm Hg) are associated with reduction in mortality and morbidity as compared with standard blood pressure targets (less than or equal to 140/ 90 mm Hg) for the treatment of patients with chronic arterial hypertension. The secondary objectives were: to determine if there is a change in mean achieved systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP associated with "lower targets" as compared with "standard targets" in patients with chronic arterial hypertension; and to determine if there is a change in withdrawals due to adverse events with "lower targets" as compared with "standard targets", in patients with elevated blood pressure.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomised controlled trials up to May 2019: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register, CENTRAL (2019, Issue 4), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials.gov. We also contacted authors of relevant papers regarding further published and unpublished work. The searches had no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing patients allocated to lower or to standard blood pressure targets (see above).

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors (JAA, VL) independently assessed the included trials and extracted data. Primary outcomes were total mortality; total serious adverse events; myocardial infarction, stroke, congestive heart failure, end stage renal disease, and other serious adverse events. Secondary outcomes were achieved mean SBP and DBP, withdrawals due to adverse effects, and mean number of antihypertensive drugs used. We assessed the risk of bias of each trial using the Cochrane risk of bias tool and the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. MAIN RESULTS: This update includes 11 RCTs involving 38,688 participants with a mean follow-up of 3.7 years. This represents 7 new RCTs compared with the original version. At baseline the mean weighted age was 63.1 years and the mean weighted blood pressure was 155/91 mm Hg. Lower targets do not reduce total mortality (risk ratio (RR) 0.95, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.86 to 1.05; 11 trials, 38,688 participants; high-certainty evidence) and do not reduce total serious adverse events (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.08; 6 trials, 18,165 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). This means that the benefits of lower targets do not outweigh the harms as compared to standard blood pressure targets. Lower targets may reduce myocardial infarction (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.96; 6 trials, 18,938 participants, absolute risk reduction (ARR) 0.4%, number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) 250 over 3.7 years) and congestive heart failure (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.92; 5 trials, 15,859 participants, ARR 0.6%, NNTB 167 over 3.7 years) (low-certainty for both outcomes). Reduction in myocardial infarction and congestive heart failure was not reflected in total serious adverse events. This may be due to an increase in other serious adverse events (RR 1.44, 95% CI 1.32 to 1.59; 6 trials. 18,938 participants, absolute risk increase (ARI) 3%, number needed to treat to harm (NNTH) 33 over four years) (low-certainty evidence). Participants assigned to a "lower" target received one additional antihypertensive medication and achieved a significantly lower mean SBP (122.8 mm Hg versus 135.0 mm Hg, and a lower mean DBP (82.0 mm Hg versus 85.2 mm Hg, than those assigned to "standard target".

Authors' Conclusions

For the general population of persons with elevated blood pressure, the benefits of trying to achieve a lower blood pressure target rather than a standard target (≤ 140/90 mm Hg) do not outweigh the harms associated with that intervention. Further research is needed to see if some groups of patients would benefit or be harmed by lower targets. The results of this review are primarily applicable to older people with moderate to high cardiovascular risk. They may not be applicable to other populations.

### Acute elevated blood pressure in the inpatient setting [^115nrWRM]. Heart (2025). Medium credibility.

Elevated blood pressure (BP) in the inpatient setting is frequently encountered by most healthcare providers. While there is general consensus on the management of acute BP elevations when associated with end-organ damage, these cases of true hypertensive emergency are relatively infrequent. In contrast, asymptomatic acute BP elevations are considerably more frequent, yet there is little consensus on their appropriate management. Contributing factors include concerns about missing true emergencies, the barriers affecting the accuracy of inpatient BP measurements and a lack of consistent data on the short- and long-term impact of inpatient BP elevations. Practice varies widely, even between departments within the same hospital, and includes observation, intravenous antihypertensives, oral agents and adjustments to existing regimens. Some clinicians also choose to discharge patients on intensified therapy based on inpatient BP values. However, despite the high prevalence of elevated BP in the inpatient setting, evidence remains heterogeneous and fragmented. This review aims to synthesise current knowledge and provide a practical, holistic framework for evaluating and managing elevated BP in the inpatient setting.

Table 1.
Proposals for Ambulatory Blood Pressure Thresholds

In 2017, the new American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guideline reclassified office BP and proposed new thresholds for the ambulatory BP, albeit without explicit justification. The rationale of the proposed thresholds was described in a later separate publication in 2019. Thresholds were, therefore, derived from the IDACO databasethat yielded risks equivalent to the new office BP categories. Among 11 152 participants representative of 13 populations, the thresholds indicating elevated 24-hour, daytime, and nighttime systolic/diastolic BPs were 120/75, 120/80, and 105/65 mm Hg, and for stages 1 and 2, ambulatory hypertension the thresholds were 125/75 and 130/80 mm Hg, 130/80 and 135/85 mm Hg, and 110/65 and 120/70 mm Hg, respectively (Table 1). In general, the thresholds proposed in the European and American guidelines closely approximated to the outcome-driven thresholds. The systolic thresholds derived in the Jackson Heart Study in relation to outcome were substantially higher compared with those proposed by European and American guidelines and those derived from the IDACO database. Ravenell et alproposed ethnic differences as a possible explanation.

### New algorithm for the diagnosis of hypertension [^113epZjJ]. American Journal of Hypertension (2005). Low credibility.

Most national and international guidelines for diagnosing hypertension include 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) and self (home) BP monitoring (SBPM) as optional methods for identifying hypertensive patients. However, none of the current guidelines have yet included ABPM or SBPM as fundamental tools for diagnosing hypertension, preferring instead to rely on conventional office readings recorded by mercury sphygmomanometry. During the past 10 years, clinical outcome studies have consistently reported 24-h ABPM and SBPM to be significantly better predictors of cardiovascular events compared with the office BP, even when recorded under "research conditions". Based on the available evidence, the Canadian Hypertension Education Program has now developed an algorithm for diagnosing hypertension that offers three options: 1) conventional office BP, 2) SBPM, or 3) 24-h ABPM. Out-of-office BP measurements are recommended, whenever feasible, to minimize both measurement error associated with mercury sphygmomanometry and the white coat effect experienced by some patients.

### Diagnostic and therapeutic problems of isolated systolic hypertension [^111dsANr]. Journal of Hypertension (2015). Low credibility.

Prevalence of isolated systolic hypertension increases with age, due to progressive elevation of SBP, and is a major risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Extensive research has shown that lowering SBP improves cardiovascular outcomes in patients with isolated systolic hypertension, yet SBP control rates remain largely inadequate regardless of antihypertensive treatment. Arterial stiffness is a major determinant of elevated SBP resulting from structural changes in the vascular system, mediated by neurohormonal alterations that occur with vascular ageing. Clinical data have demonstrated an independent association between arterial stiffness and cardiovascular outcomes. Therefore, arterial stiffness has the potential to be an important therapeutic target in the management of isolated systolic hypertension. Current antihypertensive treatments have limited effects on arterial stiffness, so the development of new treatments addressing neurohormonal alterations central to vascular ageing is important. Such therapies may represent effective strategies in the future management of SBP.

Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on hypertension:

- **Definition**: According to the 2025 ACC/AHA guidelines, elevated BP is defined as systolic pressure of 120–129 mmHg and diastolic pressure < 80 mmHg, stage 1 HTN is defined as SBP of 130–139 mmHg or DBP of 80–89 mmHg, and stage 2 HTN is defined as SBP of ≥ 140 mmHg or DBP of ≥ 90 mmHg. According to the 2024 ESC guidelines, elevated BP is defined as an office SBP of 120–139 mmHg or DBP of 70–89 mmHg, and HTN is defined as an office SBP of ≥ 140 mmHg and DBP of ≥ 90 mmHg.
- **Pathophysiology**: Primary HTN etiology is multifactorial and most frequently associated with a combination of environmental (unhealthy diet, increased sodium intake, insufficient potassium intake, inadequate physical activity, overweight/obesity) and genetic factors (multiple risk alleles, gene-gene interactions, fetal programming, epigenetic mechanisms). Secondary HTN etiology includes primary aldosteronism, renal HTN, renal parenchymal disease, pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma, Cushing's syndrome, hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, hypercalcemia and primary hyperparathyroidism, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, acromegaly, coarctation of the aorta, and medication or recreational drug use (amphetamines, cocaine, phencyclidine). White-coat HTN and isolated systolic HTN are essential subtypes.
- **Epidemiology**: HTN is highly prevalent worldwide. The prevalence of HTN in the US is estimated at 31,900 per 100,000 adults based on the 140/90 mmHg cutoff. Rates are highest in African Americans and increase with age.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for primary HTN include nonmodifiable factors, such as advancing age, African and Hispanic ancestry, and family history, and modifiable factors, include an unhealthy diet, high sodium intake, low potassium intake, physical inactivity, overweight or obesity, low socioeconomic status, and limited access to healthcare.
- **Disease course**: HTN is mostly asymptomatic until an acute hypertensive crisis or end-organ complications occur. Manifestations of end-organ damage in HTN include motor or sensory deficit (brain); hypertensive retinopathy (retina); and AF, arrhythmias, pulmonary congestion and peripheral edema (heart). Secondary HTN presents with symptoms of the causal condition, for example, abdominal bruit in renal artery stenosis or abdominal masses in polycystic kidney disease. A fourth heart sound is often the earliest sign of hypertensive heart disease. HTN decreases health-related QoL.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Prognosis is highly dependant on the BP and end-organ damage. Higher BP and more severe retinopathy or organ damage are associated with a worse prognosis. Untreated or treatment-resistant HTN leads to lower survival rates. However, effective BP control raises 10-year survival rates to 70%.

### Severe asymptomatic hypertension: evaluation and treatment [^1126awxZ]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Hypertension affects one-third of Americans and is a significant modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease, stroke, renal disease, and death. Severe asymptomatic hypertension is defined as severely elevated blood pressure (180 mm Hg or more systolic, or 110 mm Hg or more diastolic) without symptoms of acute target organ injury. The short-term risks of acute target organ injury and major adverse cardiovascular events are low in this population, whereas hypertensive emergencies manifest as acute target organ injury requiring immediate hospitalization. Individuals with severe asymptomatic hypertension often have preexisting poorly controlled hypertension and usually can be managed in the outpatient setting. Immediate diagnostic testing rarely alters short-term management, and blood pressure control is best achieved with initiation or adjustment of antihypertensive therapy. Aggressive lowering of blood pressure should be avoided, and the use of parenteral medications is not indicated. Current recommendations are to gradually reduce blood pressure over several days to weeks. Patients with escalating blood pressure, manifestation of acute target organ injury, or lack of compliance with treatment should be considered for hospital admission.

Hypertension screening, diagnosis, and monitoring — We recommend screening adults for elevated blood pressure periodically. We suggest using attended or unattended, fully automated office blood pressure measurement (programmed to wait five minutes and record the average of three measurements separated by at least 30 seconds). When fully automated blood pressure measurement is not available, we suggest measurement of blood pressure using standard technique and a properly calibrated and validated sphygmomanometer. We suggest using out-of-office blood pressure monitoring methods (ambulatory 24-hour monitoring or home blood pressure measurements) to inform the diagnosis and management of hypertension. Among patients treated for hypertension, we suggest offering home blood pressure self-monitoring with co-interventions for lowering systolic and diastolic blood pressure.

### Blood pressure and the new ACC / AHA hypertension guidelines [^115GPRbD]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

The ACC/AHA hypertension guidelines cover virtually all aspects of the diagnosis, evaluation, monitoring, secondary causes as well as drug and non-drug treatment of hypertension. Substantial and appropriate emphasis has been given to the strategies necessary for accurate measurement of blood pressure in any setting where valid blood pressure measurements are desired. Most "errors" made during blood pressure measurement bias readings upwards resulting in over-diagnosis of hypertension and, amongst those already on drug therapy, underestimating the true magnitude of blood pressure lowering resulting in over-treatment. Hypertension is diagnosed when blood pressure is consistently ≥ 130 and/or ≥ 80 mm Hg. However, the majority of patients with hypertension between 130–139/80–89 mm Hg (stage 1 hypertension) do not qualify for immediate drug therapy. The guideline breaks new ground with some of its recommendations. Absolute cardiovascular risk is utilized, for the first time, to determine high-risk status when BP 130–139/80–89 mm Hg (Stage 1 hypertension) and high-risk patient characteristics/co-morbidities are absent including age 65 and older, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, known cardiovascular disease; high-risk individuals initiate drug therapy when BP ≥ 130/80 mm Hg. The exception amongst high-risk individuals is for secondary stroke prevention in drug naïve individuals as drug therapy is initiated when blood pressure ≥ 140/90 mm Hg. Non-high risk individuals will initiate drug therapy when BP is ≥ 140/90 mm Hg. Irrespective of blood pressure threshold for initiation of drug therapy, the target BP is minimally < 130/80 mm Hg in most. However, target BP is < 130 systolic amongst those 65 and older as the committee made no recommendation for a DBP target. Treatment should be initiated with two drugs having complementary mechanisms of action when blood pressure is > 20/10 mm Hg above goal.

### Severely increased blood pressure in the emergency department [^111zKv7V]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Patients with severely increased blood pressure often present to the emergency department. Emergency physicians evaluate and treat hypertension in various contexts, ranging from the compliant patient with well-controlled blood pressure to the asymptomatic patient with increased blood pressure to the critically ill patient with increased blood pressure and acute target-organ deterioration. Despite extensive study and national guidelines for the assessment and treatment of chronically increased blood pressure, there is no clear consensus on the acute management of patients with severely increased blood pressure. In this article, we examine the broad spectrum of disease, from the asymptomatic to critically ill patient, and the dilemma it creates for the emergency physician in deciding how and when in the process to intervene.

### The potential for overdiagnosis and underdiagnosis because of blood pressure variability: a comparison of the 2017 ACC / AHA, 2018 ESC / ESH and 2019 NICE hypertension guidelines [^112fdQK6]. Journal of Hypertension (2021). Medium credibility.

TABLE 1
American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association 2017 Guideline recommendations for number of measurements for diagnosis of hypertension

Measurement variability in BP is well recognized, and exists whether measurements are made in the doctor's office, via ambulatory devices, or in the home. Both SBP and DBP vary because of physiological fluctuations throughout the day, from day to day, and week to week. Additionally, there are differences in the results that are ultimately recorded, because of differences in type of sphygmomanometer, its calibration and precision, and inter-observer differences in how the person recording the measurement interprets the reading. Systematic bias may be dealt with by calibrating sphygmomanometers or standardizing the time of day that measurement is done. But even after taking steps to standardize measurement, considerable variability may remain, with approximately 10 mmHg standard deviation, or 8.6% coefficient of variation, for repeat measurements made at clinic (office) visits over a few weeks.

In contrast to the 2017 ACC/AHA guideline, the 2018 European Society of Cardiology/European Society of Hypertension (ESC/ESH) guideline and the 2019 National Institute For Health And Care Excellence (NICE) guideline did not lower the threshold for the diagnosis of 'hypertension', which remains at 140/90 mmHg. These guidelines also emphasize accurate measurement including out-of-office BP.

In this article, we explore the effects of BP variability on the cumulative probability of overdiagnosis and underdiagnosis of hypertension made according to the 2017 ACC/AHA guideline's diagnostic criteria (threshold 130/80 mmHg) compared with the 2018 ESC/ESH and 2019 NICE guidelines' criteria (threshold 140/90 mmHg). In so doing we aim to address the question confronting a physician in practice: what are the chances that this patient in front of me is going to be over/under- diagnosed on the basis of the BP measurements I (or they) have taken? Furthermore, we use this example to illustrate the problem of test variability causing overdiagnosis and underdiagnosis and how changes in test thresholds can increase the problem.

### Association of elevated blood pressure in the emergency department with chronically elevated blood pressure [^113YZ9HF]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Hypertension affects more than one‐third of adults in the United States, and hypertension‐related emergency department (ED) visits are increasing. 1, 2 Although the spectrum of acuity for hypertension‐related ED visits ranges widely, true hypertensive emergencies, such as acute heart failure in which acute BP reduction (< 24 hours) is warranted, are rare. 3, 4 For the much more common ED visits with asymptomatic elevated BP, rapid BP reduction can cause significant harm by impairing cerebral blood flow and has not been shown to improve clinical outcomes. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 The American College of Emergency Physicians' policy recommendation on asymptomatic elevated BP in the ED reflects current lack of evidence to guide evaluation and treatment; based on expert opinion or panel consensus (level C evidence), it states that although all patients with asymptomatic elevated BP should be referred for follow‐up, routine ED testing and treatment are not needed but can be considered for those with poor follow‐up. 10

The risk of elevated BP after an ED visit and thresholds for classifying BP in the ED were not addressed by the American College of Emergency Physicians policy recommendation. Recent American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines revising the threshold for hypertension to 130/80 mm Hg among high‐risk patients adds urgency to addressing this evidence gap, as many ED patients are likely to meet these new criteria for hypertension and also have insufficient access to other sources of care. 11

There are several long‐standing barriers to using BP measured in the ED as part of diagnosing and treating hypertension. One barrier is uncertainty regarding the validity of BP measured in the ED. Despite some evidence to the contrary, BP measured in the ED is often disregarded because of concerns about measurement accuracy or because BP elevations attributed to pain, anxiety, or illness are presumed to be temporary and clinically unimportant. 12, 13 Questions about whether the ED can or should serve as a location of care to manage chronic diseases, such as hypertension, contribute to variation in how elevated BP in the ED is evaluated and treated. 14, 15, 16 Such variations in practice patterns due to lack of evidence are likely to result in worse health outcomes overall. 17

BP Classification

The most obvious difference between the 2 guidelines is their approach to BP classification and the BP cut points recommended for the identification of hypertension (Table 4). The ACC/AHA proposes categories for normal BP, elevated BP, and 2 stages of hypertension, with a cut point of systolic blood pressure (SBP) ≥ 130 mm Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) ≥ 80 mm Hg for identification of hypertension. This is a change from the preceding 2003 Joint National Committee 7 CPG, which recommended use of an SBP and/or DBP cut point of 140 and/or 90 mm Hg, except in adults with diabetes mellitus (DM) or chronic kidney disease (CKD), where an SBP and/or DBP cut point of 130 and/or 80 mm Hg was recommended. The ESC/ESH classifies BP into optimal BP, normal BP, high normal BP, 3 grades of systolic/diastolic hypertension, and isolated systolic hypertension. It retains the same SBP ≥ 140 mm Hg and/or DBP ≥ 90 mm Hg cut points for diagnosis of hypertension recommended in the preceding 2013 ESH/ESC hypertension CPG.

Table 4
Blood Pressure Classification

The potential US population impact of the ACC/AHA guideline was estimated by an analysis of the 2011 to 2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. In this analysis, 24.1% of US adults ≥ 20 years of age reported that they were taking antihypertensive medication and were therefore considered to have hypertension. Of those not taking antihypertensive medication, 7.7% had an SBP ≥ 140 mm Hg or DBP ≥ 90 mm Hg, and 13.7% had an SBP 130 to 139 mm Hg or DBP 80 to 89 mm Hg, yielding a 46% prevalence of hypertension for adults using the SBP ≥ 130 mm Hg and/or DBP ≥ 80 mm Hg cut points, or taking antihypertensive medication definition of hypertension compared with a prevalence of 32% using the SBP ≥ 140 mm Hg and/or DBP ≥ 90 mm Hg, or taking antihypertensive medication definition. Prevalence estimates using the 2 definitions of hypertension were more discrepant at younger age than at older age, and in men compared with women. Taken altogether, the ACC/AHA reclassification of BP resulted in an estimated population increase in hypertension prevalence of ≈14%. The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey analyses, however, are likely to overestimate hypertension prevalence because participant BP was only measured on a single occasion and presumed hypertension was not confirmed by out-of-office BP readings.

### 2018 ESC / ESH guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension [^115yQsni]. European Heart Journal (2018). Medium credibility.

Isolated systolic hypertension in the young — definition, risk, and management — recognizes that "some young, healthy people, and men in particular, may present with isolated grade 1 systolic hypertension (i.e. brachial SBP ≥ 140–159 mmHg and a normal DBP < 90 mmHg) and this may be associated with a normal central aortic SBP due to excessive peripheral systolic pressure amplification". Prognosis is uncertain because "it is unclear whether isolated systolic hypertension in the context of a normal aortic pressure is benign", though prospective data showed "young men with isolated systolic hypertension had a CV risk similar to that of individuals with high–normal BP" and the condition "was closely associated with smoking". Management emphasizes lifestyle and surveillance: "these young individuals should receive recommendations on lifestyle modification (particularly cessation of smoking); whether they should receive drug treatment is unclear, but they do require longer-term follow-up as many will develop sustained hypertension".

### Current challenges in the clinical management of hypertension [^111rGUsJ]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2011). Medium credibility.

Elevated blood pressure (BP) is probably the most-important modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD). BP influences the development of CVD, even if levels of BP are well below the usual cut-off point that defines the presence of arterial hypertension. Adequate measurement of BP is the most-important requirement for the diagnosis and treatment of patients with suspected hypertension. The use of methodologies such as ambulatory and home BP monitoring have become powerful tools for defining the 'real' BP of patients, discarding the white-coat effect, and discovering masked hypertension. Early intervention with life-style changes and antihypertensive drugs is required to obtain the best outcome for the patient. In this sense, early use of combination antihypertensive drug therapy is recommended. The treatment of resistant hypertension-the type of elevated BP that is most difficult to control-has clearly improved over the past decade. Further studies are required to define how antihypertensive therapy should be used in the earliest stages of hypertension and for the treatment of patients with a mild-to-moderate increase in global cardiovascular risk.

Exposure and Outcome Measurement

The primary exposure was the lowest of at least 2 recorded ED SBP values, categorized as < 140 mm Hg, 140 to 159 mm Hg, and ≥ 160 mm Hg. Primary analyses used SBP because of its relationships with cardiovascular, stroke, and mortality risk. 18, 19, 20 Two recorded ED BPs were required because BP has been shown to decrease after the first measurement, with a more accurate measurement 60 to 80 minutes after ED arrival. 21 Vanderbilt University Medical Center follows national policies regarding ED vital sign measurement frequency, which recommend that vital signs be reassessed no less frequently than every hour for the first 4 hours for patients of high severity and no less frequently than every 2 to 4 hours for patients of average or low severity, which comprise the majority of ED visits. 22 We excluded the following BP values (< 1%) as they are physiologically implausible and likely represent data entry errors: SBP ≥ 400 mm Hg, difference between SBP and DBP ≤ 10 mm Hg, and DBP ≥ SBP.

The primary outcome was mean post‐ED SBP over the year following the index ED visit, computed using all available BPs extracted from the electronic health record for 365 days after the index ED visit, including clinic and hospital BPs. We categorized mean post‐ED SBP as < 140 mm Hg or ≥ 140 mm Hg. 23 In a sensitivity analysis, the SBP threshold of 150 mm Hg was also examined, as routine office BP measurements have been shown to be > 10 mm Hg higher than more accurate methods of BP measurement. 24 In another sensitivity analysis, we examined the effect of a shorter follow‐up time interval of 6 months within the ED visit, as well as the effect of limiting the follow‐up period to 4 to 12 months after the ED visit. In a final sensitivity analysis, we stratified the models by evidence of an existing diagnosis of hypertension. In secondary analyses, we categorized ED BP by DBP (< 90 mm Hg, 90–99 mm Hg, and ≥ 100 mm Hg), and dichotomized mean post‐ED DBP as < 90 mm Hg or ≥ 90 mm Hg.

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2017 ACC / AHA hypertension guideline [^112gDYYh]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Hypertension is a modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality and reduction of elevated blood pressure (BP) remains an important intervention for slowing kidney disease progression. Over the past decade, the most appropriate BP target for initiation and titration of BP-lowering medications has been an area of intense research and debate within the clinical community. In 2017, the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) in conjunction with several other professional societies released new hypertension guidelines based on data from a systematic review of clinical trials and observational data. While many of the recommendations in the ACC/AHA hypertension guideline are relevant to nephrology practice, BP targets and management strategies for patients receiving dialysis are not discussed. This Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) commentary focuses largely on recommendations from the ACC/AHA hypertension guidelines that are pertinent to individuals at risk of chronic kidney disease or with non-dialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease. This KDOQI commentary also includes a brief discussion of the consensus statement regarding hypertension diagnosis and management for adults receiving maintenance dialysis published by the European Renal and Cardiovascular Medicine Working Group of the European Renal Association-European Dialysis and Transplant Association (ERA-EDTA) and the Hypertension and the Kidney working group of the European Society of Hypertension. Overall, we support the vast majority of the ACC/AHA recommendations and highlight select areas in which best diagnosis and treatment options remain controversial.

### Evaluation and treatment of severe asymptomatic hypertension [^1138gF2X]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Poorly controlled hypertension is a common finding in the outpatient setting. When patients present with severely elevated blood pressure (i.e., systolic blood pressure of 180 mm Hg or greater, or diastolic blood pressure of 110 mm Hg or greater), physicians need to differentiate hypertensive emergency from severely elevated blood pressure without signs or symptoms of end-organ damage (severe asymptomatic hypertension). Most patients who are asymptomatic but have poorly controlled hypertension do not have acute end-organ damage and, therefore, do not require immediate workup or treatment (within 24 hours). However, physicians should confirm blood pressure readings and appropriately classify the hypertensive state. A cardiovascular risk profile is important in guiding the treatment of severe asymptomatic hypertension; higher risk patients may benefit from more urgent and aggressive evaluation and treatment. Oral agents may be initiated before discharge, but intravenous medications and fast-acting oral agents should be reserved for true hypertensive emergencies. High blood pressure should be treated gradually. Appropriate, repeated follow-up over weeks to months is needed to reach desired blood pressure goals.

### Evaluation of optimal diastolic blood pressure range among adults with treated systolic blood pressure less than 130 mm Hg [^11521VcP]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

What are the safe and optimal diastolic blood pressure (DBP) ranges among adults with treated systolic blood pressure (SBP) of less than 130 mm Hg?

Findings

In this cohort study of 7515 patients from 2 randomized clinical trials who had treated SBP of less than 130 mm Hg, a DBP of less than 60 mm Hg was associated with increased cardiovascular risk and a DBP between 70 and 80 mm Hg was associated with lower cardiovascular risk.

Meaning

The findings suggest that a DBP of less than 60 mm Hg may be harmful and a DBP between 70 and 80 mm Hg is an optimal target for patients with treated SBP of less than 130 mm Hg; this topic merits further study.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of hypertension in the primary care setting [^115dAEVK]. VA/DoD (2020). High credibility.

Hypertension definitions and treatment thresholds — VA/DoD CPG background summarizes evolving criteria and the Work Group definition. JNC 7 defined hypertension (HTN) as a systolic blood pressure (SBP) ≥ 140 mm Hg or a diastolic blood pressure (DBP) ≥ 90 mm Hg, and prehypertension was classified as SBP 120–139 or DBP 80–89. The 2017 ACC/AHA defines HTN as an SBP ≥ 130 mm Hg, a DBP ≥ 80 mm Hg, or both; it removed prehypertension and added elevated blood pressure defined as an SBP of 120–129 with a DBP < 80 mm Hg. For this CPG, the Work Group defines HTN as an SBP ≥ 130 mm Hg, a DBP ≥ 90 mm Hg, or both, and also as SBP and/or DBP at or above 130/90 mm Hg, assuming proper measurement technique. The page notes that treatment benefit has not been proven for lowering slightly elevated blood pressures to a "normal" blood pressure of 115/75 mm Hg, and for those with a blood pressure above "normal" but not in the hypertensive range there is no evidence to date that there is a benefit from treatment.

Pediatric blood pressure (BP) categories and stages (Table 3) define thresholds by age. For children aged 1–13 years: Normal BP is < 90th percentile; elevated BP is ≥ 90th percentile to < 95th percentile or 120/80 mm Hg to < 95th percentile (whichever is lower); stage 1 hypertension (HTN) is ≥ 95th percentile to < 95th percentile + 12 mm Hg, or 130/80 to 139/89 mm Hg (whichever is lower); and stage 2 HTN is ≥ 95th percentile + 12 mm Hg, or ≥ 140/90 mm Hg (whichever is lower). For children aged ≥ 13 years: Normal BP is < 120/ < 80 mm Hg; elevated BP is 120/ < 80 to 129/ < 80 mm Hg; stage 1 HTN is 130/80 to 139/89 mm Hg; and stage 2 HTN is ≥ 140/90 mm Hg.

### Harmonization of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association and European Society of Cardiology / European Society of Hypertension blood pressure / hypertension guidelines [^117GgAjo]. European Heart Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

The ACC/AHA guideline provides 106 formal recommendations and the ESC/ESH provides 122. In both guidelines, each recommendation is characterized by a class of recommendation that specifies the strength or importance of the recommendation and by a level-of-evidence designation. Both the ESC/ESH and ACC/AHA guideline committees voted on the wording and grading of each recommendation. Both guidelines provide comprehensive advice for prevention, diagnosis, evaluation, and management of high BP/hypertension. As a result, the 2 full reports are relatively long (103 pages for the ACC/AHA and 84 pages for the ESC/ESH). For ease of reading, however, the documents are divided into sections and subsections that use a similar presentation format. In addition, a variety of shorter executive summaries and brief synopses have been published. Guideline authors have published articles that expand on individual guideline topics, provide perspective for the evidence underpinning selected recommendations, and furnish quantitative estimates of potential impact based on universal application of guideline recommendations in their target populations. Last, both guidelines are complemented by publicly available slide sets, CVD risk estimation calculators, and other educational tools.

### Association of elevated blood pressure in the emergency department with chronically elevated blood pressure [^113DqR76]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Among 8105 adults with a single ED visit during the study who had ≥ 2 BP measurements and ≥ 2 follow up BP measurements in the subsequent year, elevated ED BP was associated with increased risk of elevated mean follow‐up BP, after adjusting for multiple patient demographic and clinical factors. Importantly, patients whose lowest ED SBP was ≥ 140 mm Hg who were not diagnosed with hypertension at the time of the ED visit were more likely to have elevated blood pressure in the subsequent year. Hospitalization increased the risk of having persistently elevated SBP but not DBP at follow‐up, but pain‐related ED chief complaint did not modify the risk of elevated post‐ED BP for all levels of SBP and DBP. These findings highlight the need to ensure short‐term follow‐up, improve appropriate diagnosis of hypertension after an ED visit, and consider initiating therapy to improve long‐term management of elevated ED BP given the high likelihood of sustained BP elevation over the subsequent year.

Previous smaller studies also found that elevated BP in the ED predicts chronically elevated BP. In a study by Chernow et al of discharged patients with 2 ED BPs ≥ 160/95 mm Hg, 68% of 107 patients self‐reported having a BP ≥ 140/90 mm Hg after discharge. 29 Backer et al obtained follow‐up data in 266 ED patients with triage BP ≥ 140/90 mm Hg, and 70% had at least 1 post‐ED follow‐up BP ≥ 140/90 mm Hg. 30 Dieterle et al enrolled 41 patients in the ED and found that BP ≥ 165/105 mm Hg measured 60 to 80 minutes after ED arrival was > 90% specific for hypertension at follow‐up, whereas BP < 130/85 mm Hg was 90% sensitive for excluding hypertension. 21 Finally, Goldberg et al enrolled 91 patients and compared BP in the ED measured by multiple automated measurements, with chronic BP assessed by home BP monitoring devices. 24, 31 Of 38 patients with ED BP 140/90 to 159/99 mm Hg, 50% had home BP monitoring BP ≥ 135/85 mm Hg; of 16 patients with ED BP ≥ 160/100 mm Hg, 75% had hypertension. All but 1 of these prior studies excluded patients with a known diagnosis of hypertension, and all of the studies excluded patients who were hospitalized from the ED.

### Systolic blood pressure: it's time to take control [^115NwPHR]. American Journal of Hypertension (2004). Low credibility.

Once considered an inconsequential part of the aging process, an age-associated rise in systolic blood pressure (SBP) occurs as a consequence of increased arterial stiffness and contributes to a high prevalence of systolic hypertension after middle-age. Elevated SBP imparts a predilection toward the onset of vascular events, highlighting the importance of its control. Current philosophy ranks systolic pressure as the most relevant component of blood pressure (BP) for determining risk for cardiovascular and other events in hypertensive patients, particularly those > 50 years of age. Despite its prognostic role, SBP remains more difficult to control than diastolic BP (DBP), and most middle-age and older hypertensive patients fail to achieve recommended targets. In part, the lack of strict control of SBP in the more aged population lies in the physiology of hypertension. Younger persons tend toward isolated diastolic hypertension or combined systolic-diastolic hypertension, primarily driven by increased peripheral resistance and more effectively treated by antihypertensive medications; whereas older persons develop isolated systolic hypertension (ISH) associated with increased arterial stiffness that appears to be less amenable to current therapies. Thus, diastolic pressure in hypertensive patients often plateaus as patients reach middle-age and subsequently declines, whereas systolic pressure consistently rises through the ensuing decades. Treatment approaches favoring control of DBP frequently result in residual high SBP, putting patients at greater risk for vascular complications. Improving patient outcomes relies on antihypertensive therapy that appropriately addresses control of SBP and pulse pressure, underscoring the importance of therapeutic options that effectively reduce arterial stiffness.

### Blood pressure measurement and treatment decisions [^116xZsFU]. Circulation Research (2019). Medium credibility.

White-coat and masked hypertension are important hypertension phenotypes. Out-of-office blood pressure measurement is essential for the accurate diagnosis and monitoring of these conditions. This review summarizes literature related to the detection and diagnosis, prevalence, epidemiology, prognosis, and treatment of white-coat and masked hypertension. Cardiovascular risk in white-coat hypertension appears to be dependent on the presence of coexisting risk factors, whereas patients with masked hypertension are at increased risk of target organ damage and cardiovascular events. There is an unmet need for robust data to support recommendations around the use of antihypertensive treatment for the management of white-coat and masked hypertension.

### The potential for overdiagnosis and underdiagnosis because of blood pressure variability: a comparison of the 2017 ACC / AHA, 2018 ESC / ESH and 2019 NICE hypertension guidelines [^1166qkCZ]. Journal of Hypertension (2021). Medium credibility.

For our estimates of measurement variability we used the best and largest dataset available internationally, which was from the controlled setting of a clinical trial. Although this study population was small, and likely less diverse than that of the US population, the estimates are consistent with other albeit smaller studies of within-person variability of BP for office and for out-of-office measurement variability. We also averaged more measurements than would usually be done in routine clinical practice. In addition, our calculations of the proportion overdiagnosed are based on measurements of SBP only. As either a systolic or diastolic measurement over the diagnostic threshold is enough for a diagnosis of 'hypertension', this will further increase the risk of overdiagnosis, and decrease the risk of underdiagnosis. Therefore, the proportion overdiagnosed may well be higher than what we have calculated.

Our simulation did not investigate the possibility of discordant results between different types of measurement, such as high office BP and normal ambulatory BP or home BP in people with a true SBP < 140 mmHg ('white-coat hypertension') or normal office BP and high ambulatory BP or home BP in people with true SBP at least 140 mmHg or abnormal BP response (including 'masked hypertension', 'nocturnal hypertension' and an exaggerated blood pressure response to exercise), nor the possibility that BP variation itself provides important prognostic information. However, we note that when using a risk-based approach rather than focusing on blood pressure alone, the addition of out-of-office measurements (including night time BP and measures of variability) or indeed repeated office measurements appear to have minimal impact on clinical decision-making. Finally, we did not explore psychosocial consequences of over diagnosis and underdiagnosis, clinical consequences of overtreatment and undertreatment and health resource use/cost consequences. Future research on the downstream consequences of measurement variability will be valuable.

In conclusion, measurement variability in diagnostic tests, including blood pressure measurement, is an important and underrecognized source of overdiagnosis that might be prevented.

### Leveraging the electronic health records for population health: a case study of patients with markedly elevated blood pressure [^113G1JrL]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Definition of Markedly Elevated Blood Pressure

In this study, we focused on 2 groups of patients with markedly elevated blood pressure, regardless of diagnosis and treatment of hypertension. Group 1 included patients who had at least 1 encounter with an SBP ≥ 160 mm Hg or DBP ≥ 100 mm Hg during the study period. Group 2 included patients who had at least 1 encounter with an SBP ≥ 180 mm Hg or DBP ≥ 120 mm Hg during the study period, which corresponded to hypertension crisis in accordance with the 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Guideline for High Blood Pressure in Adults. 11 Patients in Group 2 represented a more extreme phenotype and was a subset of patients in Group 1.

Statistical Analysis

We used descriptive statistics to characterize the study population overall and by patients' blood pressure levels. We evaluated the number and percentage of the 2 groups of patients with markedly elevated blood pressure as defined above. For patients in each of these 2 groups, we first examined how often these patients had follow‐up visits with a blood pressure assessed after a markedly elevated blood pressure. Current clinical guidelines recommend repeating blood pressure evaluation in 1 month for SBP ≥ 160 mm Hg or DBP ≥ 100 mm Hg. 11 We calculated the number and percentage of patients who had at least 1 SBP or DBP elevation with a subsequent visit within 1, 3, or 6 months overall and in subgroups of age, sex, and race. Second, we examined whether blood pressure control targets were achieved within 3 or 6 months. We calculated the number and percentage of patients who had at least 1 SBP or DBP elevation with a subsequent SBP < 130 mm Hg and DBP < 80 mm Hg within 3 or 6 months 11 overall and in subgroups of age, sex, and race. We also calculated the median durations between the first measurement of elevated blood pressure and follow‐up visit and between the first measurement of elevated blood pressure and control target achievement. Third, we evaluated the percentage of patients with > 2, 3, 4, or 5 markedly elevated SBP or DBP measurements during the study period. To test the robustness of our results, we conducted a sensitivity analysis among patients with at least 5 visits during the study period (ie, on average at least 1 visit per year) and assessed how follow‐up pattern and control target achievement change. We conducted another sensitivity analysis in which we defined markedly elevated blood pressure based on 2 consecutive blood pressure elevations. Finally, we assessed how percentage of patients and time to achieve control target changed if we defined control target as SBP < 140 mm Hg and DBP < 90 mm Hg.

THE radiological finding of free air within the peritoneal cavity is usually evidence of disease or injury and is best treated by surgical exploration. Spontaneous or primary bacterial peritonitis is a bacterial infection of the peritoneum not associated with underlying surgical disease. Perforated ulcer or intestine, abscess, or penetrating abdominal wound are not factors present as the underlying cause. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis is commonly associated with underlying liver disease, usually cirrhosis with ascites, or the nephrotic syndrome. We describe a patient with cirrhosis with gross ascites and renal failure, who had signs and symptoms of peritonitis and pneumoperitoneum on roentgenogram. At laparotomy, no evidence of gastrointestinal tract perforation was found. Ascitic fluid culture yielded Clostridium perfringens, suggesting a diagnosis of SBP.

2.1 Diagnosis of hypertension

The diagnosis of hypertension requires measurement of BP in the proper environment under optimum conditions. 1 It requires that the patient be relaxed in a chair for at least 5 minutes with the arm resting. In order to establish diagnosis, ≥ 2 readings of elevated BP on ≥ 2 occasions are needed. 1 White coat hypertension is more common among elderly patients possibly related to increasing arterial stiffness, thus, ambulatory or out‐of‐office blood pressure readings is important in the subgroup of patients with mildly elevated in‐office BP readings. 2, 37 The 2017 ACC has set a blood pressure reading above ≥ 130/80 mmhg to be considered hypertensive while the European Society of Hypertension guidelines have maintained a blood pressure reading of ≥ 140/90 mmhg to be considered to be hypertensive. 38, 39 Since high BP is primarily asymptomatic, structured community programs play an important role in the diagnosis and have proven effective in diagnosis patients unaware they have hypertension. 40, 41

Introduction

High blood pressure is one of the most potent and actionable risk factors contributing to cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality in the United States and globally. 1, 2 Health systems have a major role to play in prioritizing blood pressure control and ensuring proper treatment. However, many people who are seen in health systems with high blood pressure do not receive adequate treatment, support, or assistance to control their blood pressure. 3, 4, 5, 6 These patients with persistent high blood pressure, regardless of diagnosis and treatment of hypertension, have a high risk of adverse outcomes and need attention to control blood pressure.

Electronic health record (EHR) data from large health systems have the potential for being a rich source of information that can identify patients who have high blood pressure along with gaps in care, that may inform opportunities to improve blood pressure control. 7, 8, 9 However, few studies to date have systematically identified individuals who have high blood pressure, especially those with markedly elevated blood pressure (eg, systolic blood pressure [SBP] ≥ 160 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure [DBP] ≥ 100 mm Hg), despite coming in contact with the health system. Even fewer studies have assessed patients' follow‐up care pattern.

To identify opportunities to improve care for patients, we used EHR data from the Yale–New Haven Health System (YNHHS) to describe the prevalence and follow‐up care patterns of patients with markedly elevated blood pressure. Specifically, we sought to determine the prevalence of markedly elevated blood pressure in outpatient settings, describe how often these patients have timely subsequent visits, and how commonly they ultimately achieve guideline‐based blood pressure control targets. The goal is to determine the extent of opportunity to improve care by focusing on patients in the health system whose hypertension is inadequately managed.
