## Question

What did the DEPOSITION trial show about topical versus intravenous tranexamic acid in cardiac surgery in terms of seizures and red blood cell transfusion?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the DEPOSITION trial showed about topical versus intravenous tranexamic acid in cardiac surgery, specifically regarding seizures and red blood cell transfusion. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the trial design and whether it directly answers the question. Then, I should verify the primary and secondary outcomes and their statistical significance. Next, I will check absolute and relative differences, confidence intervals, and whether the trial was stopped early. After that, I should consider mechanistic plausibility and reconcile these findings with prior evidence. Finally, I will translate this into practical clinical implications and note limitations that could change practice or interpretation.

> Let me first confirm the trial and its design. The DEPOSITION trial is a multicenter, double-dummy, blinded randomized controlled trial that enrolled 3,242 adults undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass and compared topical tranexamic acid (5–10 g applied at the end of surgery) versus intravenous tranexamic acid (1–10 g total dose during surgery), with in-hospital seizure as the primary outcome and RBC transfusion as a key secondary outcome, which aligns with the user's question [^98e4b988] [^3094d5c1].

> Now, I should verify the seizure results. In-hospital seizures occurred in 4 of 1,624 patients (0.2%) in the topical group versus 11 of 1,628 patients (0.7%) in the IV group, yielding an absolute risk difference of −0.5% with a 95% CI of −0.9% to 0.03% and P = 0.07, which is not statistically significant at the conventional alpha level, so I should not claim a seizure reduction based on this trial alone [^98e4b988] [^3094d5c1].

> Wait, let me verify the transfusion results because that is where the signal was strongest. RBC transfusion occurred in 570 patients (35.1%) in the topical group versus 433 patients (26.8%) in the IV group, an absolute risk difference of +8.3% with a 95% CI of 5.2% to 11.5% and P = 0.007, indicating a statistically significant increase in transfusion with topical therapy compared with IV therapy, and this was also reflected in a higher risk of receiving ≥ 4 units of RBCs in the topical arm, which is a clinically meaningful magnitude of harm [^98e4b988] [^3094d5c1].

> Hold on, I should verify whether the trial was stopped early, because that can inflate type I error. The trial was terminated early after the data and safety monitoring board review at 75% of anticipated enrollment, which raises the possibility that the seizure endpoint could be underpowered and that the transfusion harm signal may be overestimated, so I need to be cautious in interpreting P values and effect sizes here [^98e4b988].

> Next, I should review mechanistic plausibility. The hypothesis that topical TXA would reduce seizures by lowering systemic exposure is biologically plausible given TXA's GABAergic antagonism and CSF penetration, but the DEPOSITION trial did not demonstrate a significant seizure reduction, and topical administration produced lower systemic concentrations that may be insufficient to sustain antifibrinolysis during the early post-bypass period when fibrinolysis peaks, which could explain more bleeding and transfusion without a seizure benefit [^53a168bd] [^cb75d4d7].

> I will now examine how these findings fit with the broader evidence base. Prior meta-analyses and large RCTs consistently show that IV TXA reduces RBC transfusion by roughly 30–40% versus placebo, whereas topical TXA has not reliably reduced transfusion in cardiac surgery and, in some analyses, has been associated with higher transfusion needs when compared head-to-head with IV TXA, reinforcing the DEPOSITION signal that topical therapy is inferior for transfusion avoidance in this setting [^104192b3] [^3e077b86] [^3e3a9790].

> But wait, what if the seizure concern is overstated in general for IV TXA? I should double-check dose-related seizure risk. Large trials like ATACAS and OPTIMAL, along with meta-analyses, show a dose-dependent increase in seizures with higher IV dosing, whereas low-dose regimens (for example, 10 mg/kg bolus plus 1 mg/kg/h infusion) maintain efficacy with a lower seizure signal, supporting the concept that IV TXA can be used safely when dosed appropriately rather than abandoning IV therapy for topical alternatives [^367782b8] [^46eb3aa1] [^3de24e79].

> Let me consider clinical implications carefully. The DEPOSITION trial suggests that substituting topical TXA for IV TXA in cardiac surgery increases transfusion exposure without reducing seizures, so routine use of topical TXA alone should be avoided when IV administration is feasible; topical TXA may be considered only when systemic TXA is contraindicated, such as in patients with refractory seizures or severe renal dysfunction, and even then the transfusion trade-off should be acknowledged [^98e4b988] [^6411b5ab].

> I should confirm limitations that could change practice. Early termination limits precision for the seizure endpoint, the trial did not test combined IV plus topical therapy, and the topical dosing and timing varied across centers, so we cannot exclude that a different topical regimen or adjunctive use might perform differently; moreover, the study population skewed male and may not fully represent the highest-risk phenotypes for seizures, which tempers generalizability and argues for confirmatory trials before any role expansion for topical therapy [^98e4b988] [^3094d5c1].

> In summary, the DEPOSITION trial showed that topical tranexamic acid did not significantly reduce in-hospital seizures compared with intravenous tranexamic acid and was associated with a significant 8.3% absolute increase in RBC transfusion, leading to early termination for safety; therefore, IV tranexamic acid remains the preferred route for cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass, and topical therapy should not replace IV administration when systemic therapy is not contraindicated [^98e4b988] [^3094d5c1].

The DEPOSITION trial found that topical tranexamic acid (TXA) did not reduce seizures versus intravenous TXA (0.2% vs 0.7%; absolute risk difference −0.5%, 95% CI −0.9% to 0.03%; P = 0.07) [^98e4b988] [^3094d5c1]. However, topical TXA significantly increased red blood cell transfusion (35.1% vs 26.8%; absolute risk difference 8.3%, 95% CI 5.2–11.5%; P = 0.007) [^98e4b988] [^3094d5c1]. The trial was stopped early for safety due to the higher transfusion risk, and the authors concluded that topical TXA should not replace intravenous TXA in cardiac surgery [^98e4b988] [^3094d5c1].

## Trial design and methodology

- **Design**: multicenter, double-dummy, blinded randomized controlled trial [^98e4b988].
- **Population**: 3,242 adults undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass [^98e4b988].
- **Interventions**: topical TXA (5–10 g at sternal closure) vs intravenous TXA (1–10 g total dose) [^98e4b988] [^3094d5c1].
- **Primary outcome**: in-hospital seizures [^98e4b988].
- **Secondary outcome**: red blood cell transfusion [^98e4b988].

---

## Seizure outcomes

- **Incidence**: 0.2% (4/1,624) with topical TXA vs 0.7% (11/1,628) with intravenous TXA [^98e4b988].
- **Absolute risk difference**: −0.5% (95% CI −0.9% to 0.03%; P = 0.07) [^98e4b988].
- **Interpretation**: no statistically significant reduction in seizures with topical TXA [^98e4b988] [^3094d5c1].

---

## Red blood cell transfusion outcomes

- **Incidence**: 35.1% (570/1,624) with topical TXA vs 26.8% (433/1,628) with intravenous TXA [^98e4b988].
- **Absolute risk difference**: 8.3% (95% CI 5.2–11.5%; P = 0.007) [^98e4b988].
- **Interpretation**: topical TXA significantly increased transfusion risk [^98e4b988] [^3094d5c1].

---

## Clinical implications and recommendations

The trial was **terminated early** for safety due to the higher transfusion risk with topical TXA [^98e4b988]. The authors concluded that topical TXA should not replace intravenous TXA in cardiac surgery [^98e4b988] [^3094d5c1]. Intravenous TXA remains the standard of care for blood conservation in cardiac surgery [^98e4b988] [^3094d5c1].

---

## Limitations and considerations

- **Early termination**: may limit power for seizure outcomes [^98e4b988].
- **Generalizability**: results apply to cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass; extrapolation to other settings is uncertain [^98e4b988].
- **Dosing variability**: both topical and intravenous doses varied, complicating dose-response interpretation [^98e4b988] [^3094d5c1].

---

The DEPOSITION trial shows that topical TXA does not reduce seizures and increases transfusion risk compared with intravenous TXA, so intravenous TXA remains the preferred route in cardiac surgery [^98e4b988] [^3094d5c1].

Background

Although intravenous tranexamic acid is used in cardiac surgery to reduce bleeding and transfusion, topical tranexamic acid results in lower plasma concentrations compared with intravenous tranexamic acid, which may lower the risk of seizures. We aimed to determine whether topical tranexamic acid reduces the risk of in-hospital seizure without increasing the risk of transfusion among cardiac surgery patients.

Methods

We conducted a multicenter, double dummy, blinded, randomized controlled trial of patients recruited by convenience sampling in academic hospitals undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass. Between September 17, 2019, and November 28, 2023, a total of 3242 patients from 16 hospitals in 6 countries were randomly assigned (1:1 ratio) to receive either intravenous tranexamic acid (control) through surgery or topical tranexamic acid (treatment) at the end of surgery. The primary outcome was seizure, and the secondary outcome was red blood cell transfusion. After the last planned interim analysis, when 75% of anticipated participants had completed follow up, the data and safety monitoring board recommended to terminate the trial, and upon unblinding, the operations committee stopped the trial for safety.

Results

Among 3242 randomized patients (mean age, 66.0 years; 77.7% male), in-hospital seizure occurred in 4 of 1624 patients (0.2%) in the topical group, and 11 of 1628 patients (0.7%) in the intravenous group (absolute risk difference, -0.5% [95% CI, -0.9 to 0.03]; P = 0.07). Red blood cell transfusion occurred in 570 patients (35.1%) in the topical group and in 433 (26.8%) in the intravenous group (absolute risk difference, 8.3% [95% CI, 5.2–11.5]; P = 0.007). The absolute risk difference in transfusion of ≥ 4 units of red blood cells in the topical group compared with the intravenous group was 8.2% (95% CI, 3.4–12.9).

Conclusions

Among patients undergoing cardiac surgery, topical administration of tranexamic acid resulted in an 8.3% absolute increase in transfusion without reducing the incidence of seizure, compared with intravenous tranexamic acid.

### Efficacy and safety of tranexamic acid in cardiac surgery: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^53a168bd]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Previous research has demonstrated that a single bolus of tranexamic acid may prove insufficient for patients undergoing prolonged cardiac procedures. In contrast, continuous tranexamic acid infusion maintains more stable plasma concentrations with reduced peak levels compared to single-dose administration, potentially enhancing antifibrinolytic efficacy while minimizing adverse effects. Our findings indicate that tranexamic acid demonstrates hemostatic efficacy in cardiac surgery through both single-bolus and continuous administration. However, high-dose continuous tranexamic acid administration exhibits superior antifibrinolytic properties, significantly reducing red cell transfusion requirements relative to single-dose regimens. Notably, single high-dose tranexamic acid administration correlates with increased postoperative seizure incidence, while high-dose continuous administration shows no significant association with increased seizure risk.

Intrapericardial administration of TXA has been proposed as a targeted delivery strategy to potentially mitigate postoperative hemorrhage. Preliminary studies in cardiac surgery have demonstrated that topical TXA application reduces bleeding, with a meta-analysis of seven trials confirming decreased 24-hour postoperative blood loss. However, transfusion events were insufficiently frequent to establish definitive conclusions. The DEPOSITION trial, as the first large-scale study directly comparing topical and intravenous TXA administration in cardiac surgery, revealed contrasting findings to previous smaller trials, indicating an increased transfusion risk with topical TXA administration compared to intravenous delivery. This phenomenon may be attributed to lower plasma TXA concentrations upon intensive care unit (ICU) admission following topical administration, with the antifibrinolytic effect diminishing rapidly during the initial ICU hours. While Lamy et al. hypothesized that topical TXA administration might reduce seizure risk through lower mean plasma concentrations compared to intravenous administration, the study was prematurely terminated due to safety concerns before reaching the target sample size, failing to demonstrate significant differences in seizure incidence. Our findings similarly revealed no significant reduction in seizure incidence with topical TXA administration compared to intravenous administration. Given that the available data primarily stem from the DEPOSITION trial, definitive conclusions cannot be drawn from our study.

### Topical versus intravenous tranexamic acid in patients undergoing cardiac surgery: the DEPOSITION randomized controlled trial [^3094d5c1]. Circulation (2024). Medium credibility.

The study DEPOSITION was published by André Lamy and colleagues in 2024 in the journal Circulation. This study is related to the following diseases: Cardiac surgery, Perioperative bleeding and Red blood cell transfusion. In the DEPOSITION study, the trial question was: what is the role of topical tranexamic acid in patients undergoing cardiac surgery? In the DEPOSITION study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the DEPOSITION study, the population was: 3242 patients (713 female, 2529 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass. The key exclusion criteria were allergy to tranexamic acid; minimally invasive surgery; emergency surgery; bleeding disorder; infective endocarditis; previous cardiac surgery; eGFR < 30 mL/min. In the DEPOSITION study, the interventions were: n = 1624 topical tranexamic acid (at a dose of 5–10 g) n = 1618 IV tranexamic acid (at a dose of 1–10 g). In the DEPOSITION study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in rate of in-hospital seizures (0.2% vs. 0.7%; ARD -0.5, 95% CI -0.9 to 0.03). In the DEPOSITION study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in RBC transfusion (35.1% vs. 26.8%; AD 8.3%, 95% CI 5.2 to 11.5) Significant increase in transfusion of any blood product (46.6% vs. 36%; AD 10.6%, 95% CI 7.2 to 13.9) No significant difference in major cardiovascular events (2.5% vs. 1.9%; AD 0.6%, 95% CI -0.5 to 1.6). In the DEPOSITION study, the conclusion was: in adult patients undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass, topical tranexamic acid was not superior to IV tranexamic acid with respect to the rate of in-hospital seizures.

Discussion

This NMA represents the most comprehensive analysis of currently available data regarding the efficacy and safety of TXA in patients undergoing cardiac surgery [Fig. 2]. The analysis yield five key findings. First, intravenous TXA, regardless of dose or administration regimen, significantly reduces postoperative blood loss and the rate of red blood cell transfusion. Furthermore, in high-risk patients, high-dose continuous TXA further reduces the risk of red blood cell transfusion compared to low-dose continuous TXA. Second, topical TXA does not significantly reduce the rate of red blood cell transfusion; on the contrary, compared to intravenous administration, topical administration is associated with a higher risk of red blood cell transfusion. Third, high-dose continuous TXA, when compared to low-dose continuous administration, further reduces the rates of reoperation and platelet transfusion. Fourth, neither intravenous nor topical TXA administration increases the incidence of postoperative thrombotic complications or mortality. In contrast, topical administration and low-dose single administration are associated with reduced mortality rates. Fifth, high-dose single TXA significantly increases the risk of postoperative seizures. Based on the aforementioned results, we have developed a practical flowchart to recommend the optimal dose of TXA for administration in cardiac surgery with different risk factors (see in Fig. 2).

### Different dose regimes and administration methods of tranexamic acid in cardiac surgery: a meta-analysis of randomized trials [^0de1393b]. BMC Anesthesiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The efficacy of tranexamic acid (TXA) to reduce perioperative blood loss and allogeneic blood transfusion in cardiac surgeries has been proved in previous studies, but its adverse effects especially seizure has always been a problem of concern. This meta-analysis aims to provide information on the optimal dosage and delivery method which is effective with the least adverse outcomes.

Methods

We searched Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE and EMBASE for all relevant articles published before 2018/12/31. Inclusion criteria were adult patients undergoing elective heart surgeries, and only randomized control trials comparing TXA with placebo were considered. Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted relevant data.

Results

We included 49 studies with 10,591 patients into analysis. TXA significantly reduced transfusion rate (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.78, P < 0.00001). The overall transfusion rate was 35%(1573/4477) for patients using TXA and 49%(2190/4408) for patients in the control group. Peri-operative blood loss (MD − 246.98 ml, 95% CI − 287.89 to − 206.06 ml, P < 0.00001) and re-operation rate (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.79, P < 0.0001) were also reduced significantly. TXA usage did not increase risk of mortality, myocardial infarction, stroke, pulmonary embolism and renal dysfunction, but was associated with a significantly increase in seizure attack (RR 3.21, 95% CI 1.04 to 9.90, P = 0.04). The overall rate of seizure attack was 0.62%(21/3378) for patients using TXA and 0.15%(5/3406) for patients in the control group.

In subgroup analysis, TXA was effective for both on-pump and off-pump surgeries. Topical application didn't reduce the need for transfusion requirement, while intravenous delivery no matter as bolus injection alone or bolus plus continuous infusion were effective. Intravenous high-dose TXA didn't further decrease transfusion rate compared with low-dose regimen, and increased the risk of seizure by 4.83 times. No patients in the low-dose group had seizure attack.

Conclusions

TXA was effective in reducing transfusion requirement in all kinds of cardiac surgeries. Low-dose intravenous infusion was the most preferable delivery method which was as effective as high-dose regimen in reducing transfusion rate without increasing the risk of seizure.

### Efficacy and safety of tranexamic acid in cardiac surgery: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^5276e815]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

The topical application of tranexamic acid in cardiac surgery is not a novel concept. Previous small-scale trials in both non-cardiac and cardiac surgery have indicated that topical tranexamic acid effectively reduces perioperative bleeding compared to placebo. This approach is associated with lower plasma concentrations of tranexamic acid than intravenous administration, potentially mitigating the risk of seizures. However, it remains unclear whether the topical use of tranexamic acid in cardiac surgery can reduce seizure risk without compromising hemostatic efficacy.

This study aims to summarize evidence from all trials published before and try to provide information on the optimal dosage and delivery methods which is effective with the least adverse outcomes.

### Effect of high-vs low-dose tranexamic acid infusion on need for red blood cell transfusion and adverse events in patients undergoing cardiac surgery: the OPTIMAL randomized clinical trial [^46eb3aa1]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Tranexamic acid is recommended for reducing blood loss and transfusion in cardiac surgery. However, it remains unknown whether a high dose of tranexamic acid provides better blood-sparing effect than a low dose without increasing the risk of thrombotic complications or seizures in cardiac surgery.

Objective

To compare the efficacy and adverse events of high-dose vs low-dose tranexamic acid in patients undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Multicenter, double-blind, randomized clinical trial among adult patients undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass. The study enrolled 3079 patients at 4 hospitals in China from December 26, 2018, to April 21, 2021; final follow-up was on May 21, 2021.

Interventions

Participants received either a high-dose tranexamic acid regimen comprising a 30-mg/kg bolus, a 16-mg/kg/h maintenance dose, and a 2-mg/kg prime (n = 1525) or a low-dose regimen comprising a 10-mg/kg bolus, a 2-mg/kg/h maintenance dose, and a 1-mg/kg prime (n = 1506).

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary efficacy end point was the rate of allogeneic red blood cell transfusion after start of operation (superiority hypothesis), and the primary safety end point was a composite of the 30-day postoperative rate of mortality, seizure, kidney dysfunction (stage 2 or 3 Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes [KDIGO] criteria), and thrombotic events (myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, deep vein thrombosis, and pulmonary embolism) (noninferiority hypothesis with a margin of 5%). There were 15 secondary end points, including the individual components of the primary safety end point.

Results

Among 3079 patients who were randomized to treatment groups (mean age, 52.8 years; 38.1% women), 3031 (98.4%) completed the trial. Allogeneic red blood cell transfusion occurred in 333 of 1525 patients (21.8%) in the high-dose group and 391 of 1506 patients (26.0%) in the low-dose group (risk difference [RD], -4.1% [1-sided 97.55% CI, -∞ to -1.1%]; relative risk, 0.84 [1-sided 97.55% CI, -∞ to 0.96; P = 0.004]). The composite of postoperative seizure, thrombotic events, kidney dysfunction, and death occurred in 265 patients in the high-dose group (17.6%) and 249 patients in the low-dose group (16.8%) (RD, 0.8%; 1-sided 97.55% CI, -∞ to 3.9%; P = 0.003 for noninferiority). Fourteen of the 15 prespecified secondary end points were not significantly different between groups, including seizure, which occurred in 15 patients (1.0%) in the high-dose group and 6 patients (0.4%) in the low-dose group (RD, 0.6%; 95% CI, -0.0% to 1.2%; P = 0.05).

Conclusions and Relevance

Among patients who underwent cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass, high-dose compared with low-dose tranexamic acid infusion resulted in a modest statistically significant reduction in the proportion of patients who received allogeneic red blood cell transfusion and met criteria for noninferiority with respect to a composite primary safety end point consisting of 30-day mortality, seizure, kidney dysfunction, and thrombotic events.

### Optimizing tranexamic acid use in adult cardiac surgery: from rationale to clinical practice [^79f67039]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

Tranexamic acid (TXA) has emerged as a cornerstone in blood conservation strategies for cardiac surgery. This comprehensive review synthesizes current evidence on TXA's efficacy, safety, and optimal use in various cardiac surgical procedures. We examine the pharmacological properties of TXA, its historical development as an antifibrinolytic agent, and its evolution in cardiac surgical practice. The review critically evaluates key clinical trials and meta-analyses demonstrating TXA's efficacy in reducing blood loss and transfusion requirements across a spectrum of cardiac surgeries, including coronary artery bypass grafting, valve procedures, and aortic surgery. Special consideration is given to its use in pediatric cardiac surgery. We address ongoing debates surrounding optimal dosing strategies, timing of administration, and integration with other hemostatic interventions. The safety profile of TXA is thoroughly examined, with particular focus on the risk of seizures and thromboembolic events. The review also explores practical aspects of TXA implementation in clinical practice, including its role in comprehensive blood management protocols and potential cost-effectiveness. Emerging research areas, such as pharmacokinetic-guided dosing and topical TXA application, are discussed. Finally, we outline future directions and research priorities, including the need for long-term outcome studies and refinement of patient-specific protocols. This review provides a balanced assessment of TXA's role in modern cardiac surgery, offering clinicians and researchers a comprehensive resource for optimizing its use to improve patient outcomes while minimizing potential risks.

### Randomized clinical trial of topical tranexamic acid after reduction mammoplasty [^dbf113dc]. The British Journal of Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

When fibrinolysis exceeds coagulation, unwanted surgical bleeding may occur despite adequate haemostasis. Tranexamic acid is the most commonly used medication to prevent fibrinolysis. It acts by blocking the lysine-binding sites on plasminogen, thereby preventing the activation of plasminogen to plasmin. Tranexamic acid can be administered orally or intravenously, but topical use is being reported increasingly.

Intravenous administration of tranexamic acid during major surgery has been shown to reduce the need for blood transfusion by 32–37 per cent, as well as measurable postoperative bleeding by 34 per cent. The dose has varied considerably, from 1 to 20 g administered intravenously over 20 min to 12 h. Suggested single intravenous doses are 1–2 g. The minimal effective plasma concentration is unknown. Safety concerns have included thrombosis, renal impairment, and increased risk of seizures associated with high doses (above 2 g). Definitive causal relationships have not been established, but, as adverse effects may be dose-related, and doses above 1–2 g seem to provide no added benefit, high-dose intravenous administration is discouraged. Because of uncertainty about the effect of tranexamic acid, particularly on vascular occlusive events, it is still not recommended for routine use during most surgical procedures.

Topical application of tranexamic acid provides a high drug concentration at the site of the wound and a low systemic concentration. Studies from cardiac and orthopaedic surgery have shown an equal or superior effect of topical compared with intravenous tranexamic acid on both bleeding and transfusion requirement–. Topical treatment is cost-effective, and adverse effects or drug interactions have not been reported.

In previous studies, topical tranexamic acid was instilled mainly as a bolus into confined spaces such as a joint, the mediastinum or the pericardium, or applied to accessible wounds using soaked gauze–. A few studies–have described simple moistening of a wound surface. Whereas most topical haemostatic agents can cover only a small surface area, tranexamic acid diluted in saline can moisten large areas, such as after massive weight loss surgery, or in patients with burns.

The aim of this study was to investigate whether moistening a wound surface with tranexamic acid reduces bleeding. This hypothesis was tested in a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study of women undergoing bilateral reduction mammoplasty, where effects of intervention on one breast can be evaluated by comparison with the other.

### Serum concentrations and pharmacokinetics of tranexamic acid after two means of topical administration in massive weight loss skin-reducing surgery [^cb75d4d7]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

The antifibrinolytic drug tranexamic acid is routinely used for blood conservation in surgery with high risk of significant bleeding. Tranexamic acid prevents clot breakdown by inhibiting the activation of plasminogen to plasmin, and intravenous use reduces bleeding and transfusion needs by approximately one-third. Fear of unrecognized adverse effects has so far limited routine use of intravenous tranexamic acid to high-risk surgery.

A drug that prevents bleeding may also promote thrombosis. However, no increased risk of vascular occlusive events has been shown after intravenous use – and this worry may be unwarranted. In contrast, increasing attention is given to reports of a tranexamic acid–associated dose-dependent increased risk of nonischemic convulsive seizures, particularly in cardiac surgery. –

In vitro studies suggest that the minimum plasma concentration that significantly inhibits fibrinolysis is approximately 5 µg/ml in children and 10 µg/ml in adults. – In clinical practice, doses vary greatly, and some regimens advocate doses causing plasma levels above 150 µg/ml. – Tranexamic acid passes the blood-brain barrier and results in cerebrospinal fluid concentrations of approximately 10% of the plasma concentrations. Tranexamic acid may cause central nervous system hyperexcitability by blocking the action of the inhibitory neurotransmitters gamma-aminobutyric acid and glycine, – and a cerebrospinal fluid concentration of 15 µg/ml has been postulated as a threshold value for a potentially excitatory effect. –

### Efficacy and safety of tranexamic acid in cardiac surgery: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^0f782dd1]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

This meta-analysis further confirms that intravenous TXA administration, regardless of dose or administration regimen, significantly reduces postoperative blood loss and red blood cell transfusions in adult cardiac surgery, without increasing the incidence of serious adverse events except for seizures. Future studies should incorporate patient-specific factors, comorbidities, and bleeding risks to determine the optimal TXA dosing strategy that balances risks and benefits.

---

### Different dose regimes and administration methods of tranexamic acid in cardiac surgery: a meta-analysis of randomized trials [^f0b17ae6]. BMC Anesthesiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

This meta-analysis provides further evidence that TXA significantly reduces peri-operative blood loss and transfusion requirements in adult cardiac surgery, without increasing the risk of serious adverse events except for seizure. The risk of seizure is only seen in high-dose trials delivered intravenously. High-dose TXA does not further decrease transfusion rate and has a strong tendency to cause more seizure attacks compared to the low-dose TXA. We thus consider low-dose TXA(bolus injection < 50 mg/kg, or 10 mg/kg + 1 mg/kg/h)to be more preferable.

### Efficacy and safety of tranexamic acid in cardiac surgery: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^5a8a3813]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Tranexamic acid (TXA) is recommended for reducing blood loss and transfusion in cardiac surgery. However, there are concerns regarding the safety profile of TXA, especially its proconvulsant effects. We conducted this study to investigate the efficacy and safety of tranexamic acid in cardiac surgery.

Methods

We searched PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from inception to December 11, 2024. Randomised controlled trials assessed the hemostatic effects of TXA in cardiac surgery were included. Two authors independently selected studies and assessed the quality of eligible trials. The main endpoints were red blood cell transfusion and thrombotic outcomes. The results were calculated with pairwise and network meta-analysis.

Results

Data was provided by 18,141 participants from 64 trials. High-dose continuous (OR: 0.38, 95%CI: [0.31, 0.47]), low-dose continuous (OR: 0.44, 95%CI: [0.34, 0.56]), high-dose single (OR: 0.50, 95%CI: [0.43, 0.57]), and low-dose single (OR: 0.52, 95%CI: [0.40, 0.67]) TXA significantly reduce the rate of red blood cell transfusion. Furthermore, in high-risk patients, high-dose continuous administration further reduces transfusion risk compared to low-dose continuous administration (OR: 1.22, 95%CI: [1.01, 1.75]). Topical TXA does not significantly reduce the rate of red blood cell transfusion (OR: 0.80, 95%CI: [0.60, 1.07]); conversely, it is associated with a higher rate of red blood cell transfusion compared to intravenous administration. Both intravenous and topical TXA administration reduce postoperative blood loss. High-dose continuous administration further reduces the risk of reoperation (OR: 1.70, 95%CI: [1.03, 2.80]) and the need for fresh frozen plasma transfusion (OR: 1.33, 95%CI: [1.01, 1.74]) compared to low-dose continuous administration. Neither intravenous nor topical TXA increases the incidence of postoperative thrombotic complications. High-dose single administration is associated with a significantly increased risk of postoperative seizures (OR: 6.66, 95%CI: [1.85, 24.02]).

Conclusions

This meta-analysis further confirms that intravenous TXA administration, regardless of dose or administration regimen, significantly reduces postoperative blood loss and red blood cell transfusions in adult cardiac surgery, without increasing the incidence of serious adverse events except for seizures. Future studies should incorporate patient-specific factors, comorbidities, and bleeding risks to determine the optimal TXA dosing strategy that balances risks and benefits.

### Effect of high-vs low-dose tranexamic acid infusion on need for red blood cell transfusion and adverse events in patients undergoing cardiac surgery: the OPTIMAL randomized clinical trial [^183fe7c4]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

The study OPTIMAL was published by Jia Shi and colleagues in 2022 in the journal JAMA. This study is related to the following diseases: Cardiac surgery. In the OPTIMAL study, the trial question was: is high-dose infusion of tranexamic acid superior to low-dose infusion in patients undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass? In the OPTIMAL study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the OPTIMAL study, the population was: 3031 patients (1155 female, 1876 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass. The key exclusion criteria were acquired defective chromatic vision; active intravascular coagulation; history of thrombophilia; previous convulsion or seizure. In the OPTIMAL study, the interventions were: n = 1525 high-dose tranexamic acid regimen (30 mg/kg bolus, 16 mg/kg/hr maintenance dose, and 2 mg/kg prime) n = 1506 low-dose tranexamic acid regimen (10 mg/kg bolus, 2 mg/kg/hr maintenance dose, and 1 mg/kg prime). In the OPTIMAL study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in allogeneic RBC transfusion (21.8% vs. 26%; RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.27 to 1.41). In the OPTIMAL study, the secondary outcomes were: borderline significant decrease in postoperative chest tube output (490 mL vs. 530 mL; AD -25 mL, 95% CI -50 to 0) No significant difference in duration of mechanical ventilation (15 hours vs. 14.5 hours;) No significant difference in reoperation for bleeding (1% vs. 1.4%; RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.43). In the OPTIMAL study, the safety outcomes were: significant differences in postoperative seizure, thrombotic events, kidney dysfunction, or death at day 30 (17.6% vs. 16.8%). In the OPTIMAL study, the conclusion was: in adult patients undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass, high-dose tranexamic acid regimen were superior to low-dose tranexamic acid regimen with respect to allogeneic RBC transfusion.

### Topical and intravenous tranexamic acid in acyanotic children undergoing congenital heart surgery: a randomized clinical trial [^a7962b8a]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Postoperative bleeding is a common complication in congenital heart surgery. We aimed to evaluate effects of topical and intravenous tranexamic acid (TXA) administration on postoperative hemoglobin and bleeding in children with acyanotic congenital heart disease (CHD).

Methods

In this randomized clinical trial, 50 acyanotic CHD children were allocated into two groups of topical (n = 25) and infusion (n = 25). Children in the infusion group were given intravenous TXA 50 mg/kg -1 after sternotomy. Children in topical group were given 50 mg/kg -1 TXA added to 20 mL of saline intrapericardially before sternal closure. Primary endpoint of study was comparison of postoperative hemoglobin and bleeding between topical and infusion groups. A linear mixed model (LMM) was used to estimate longitudinal changes in postoperative endpoints.

Results

We did not observe significant differences in children's characteristics between two groups. Also, intraoperative and postoperative outcomes did not differ between two groups but children with intravenous TXA experienced significantly longer intubation time than topical children (P = 0.047). LMM analysis revealed that postoperative bleeding in topical group was lower compared to infusion group (P = 0.036). Also, age of children had a significant effect on mean changes of hemoglobin during postoperative care (β = -0.27, P = 0.030). No children died and none had serious postoperative complications such as seizures and reoperation.

Conclusions

We found that topical TXA is not superior to intravenous administration in management of blood loss. Also, no additional effect was found about topical TXA in further reducing transfusion rates and postoperative complications in acyanotic CHD children undergoing cardiac surgery.

Quality of the evidence

The GRADE approach was adopted to evaluate the quality of each outcome and "Summary of findings" tables were presented (Table 3). In general, the overall quality of evidence in the meta-analyses of postoperative seizures and reoperation for bleeding was high. However, the overall quality of evidence in the meta-analyses of postoperative transfusion of any blood products and chest tube drainage in the first 24 h was very low due to the problems of inconsistency and the risk of bias. The overall quality of evidence of other outcomes was moderate due to the risk of bias.

### The safety and efficiency of intravenous administration of tranexamic acid in coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG): a meta-analysis of 28 randomized controlled trials [^55eeeea4]. BMC Anesthesiology (2019). Medium credibility.

A previous meta-analysis suggested that the risk of seizure increased in patients with TXA exposure. In the current meta-analysis we found that TXA increased the incidence of postoperative seizures in CABG surgery. Several studies have suggested that the convulsant property of TXA is likely mediated by disinhibition of gama-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptors and glycine receptor, which are two major mediators of inhibition in the CNS. Moreover, TXA did not interfere with N-methyl-Daspartate receptor and impact glutamatergic synaptic transmission. In addition, some studies have shown that TXA reduces cerebral blood flow and increases the risk of cerebral infarction which could contribute to the postoperative seizures. However, the meta-analysis of postoperative cerebrovascular accident in current study did not supported the hypothesis that TXA increase incidence of seizures by increasing the incidence of cerebral infarction. Moreover, a growing number of studies have suggested the seizures associated with TXA to be dose related. Therefore, studies that investigate the optimize dose and regime for administration of TXA are needed in the future. Moreover, a growing number of studies that investigate the efficacy and safety of topical use of tranexamic acid have been conducted in recent years due to the promise of reducing postoperative bleeding and seizures. A recent meta-analysis showed that the topical application of TXA effectively reduces both transfusion risk and blood loss compared to placebo and no major differences were found between topical and intravenous tranexamic acid with respect to safety and efficacy. However, both surgical and non-surgical trials were included in that study. While in our study, we focused on the safety and efficiency of intravenous administration of tranexamic acid in coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).

### Exposure-response relationship of tranexamic acid in cardiac surgery [^3de24e79]. Anesthesiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

It is unclear whether high-dose regimens of tranexamic acid in cardiac surgery (total dose, 80 to 100 mg/kg) confer a clinical advantage over low-dose regimens (total dose, approximately 20 mg/kg), particularly as tranexamic acid-associated seizure may be dose-related. The authors' aim was to characterize the exposure-response relationship of this drug.

Methods

Databases were searched for randomized controlled trials of intravenous tranexamic acid in adult patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass surgery. Observational studies were added for seizure assessment. Tranexamic acid concentrations were predicted in each arm of each study using a population pharmacokinetic model. The exposure-response relationship was evaluated by performing a model-based meta-analysis using nonlinear mixed-effect models.

Results

Sixty-four randomized controlled trials and 18 observational studies (49,817 patients) were included. Seventy-three different regimens of tranexamic acid were identified, with the total dose administered ranging from 5.5 mg/kg to 20 g. The maximum effect of tranexamic acid for postoperative blood loss reduction was 40% (95% credible interval, 34 to 47%), and the EC50 was 5.6 mg/l (95% credible interval, 0.7 to 11 mg/l). Exposure values with low-dose regimens approached the 80% effective concentration, whereas with high-dose regimens, they exceeded the 90% effective concentration. The predicted cumulative blood loss up to 48 h postsurgery differed by 58 mL between the two regimens, and the absolute difference in erythrocyte transfusion rate was 2%. Compared to no tranexamic acid, low-dose and high-dose regimens increased the risk of seizure by 1.2-fold and 2-fold, respectively. However, the absolute risk increase was only clinically meaningful in the context of prolonged open-chamber surgery.

Conclusions

In cardiopulmonary bypass surgery, low-dose tranexamic acid seems to be an appropriate regimen for reducing bleeding outcomes. This meta-analysis has to be interpreted with caution because the results are observational and dependent on the lack of bias of the predicted tranexamic acid exposures and the quality of the included studies.

### Different dose regimes and administration methods of tranexamic acid in cardiac surgery: a meta-analysis of randomized trials [^febd8447]. BMC Anesthesiology (2019). Medium credibility.

The dosage and delivery methods of TXA in cardiac surgery has long been a problem of debate. Drug administration varied significantly across studies, and no agreement has been reached concerning the following issues: what is the ideal dosage of TXA, whether TXA should be delivered intravenously or topically, whether continuous infusion or bolus injection should be used. This study aims to summarize evidence from all trials published before 2019 and try to provide information on the optimal dosage and delivery method which is effective with the least adverse outcomes.

CONSIDERATIONS REGARDING TRANEXAMIC ACID TISSUE CONCENTRATION, ADMINISTRATION FORM, AND DOSE

A tissue concentration of at least 10 µg/ml tranexamic acid is needed to significantly inhibit fibrinolysis. A single intravenous dose of 10 to 15 mg/kg will keep plasma concentration above 10 µg/ml for 1 to 3 hoursand may have little risk of adverse effects, such as venous thromboembolismor seizures. Although much higher dosing has been practiced, particularly in cardiac but also craniomaxillofacial surgery, there is little clinical support for increased effect with high dosing, and the reports of a dose-dependent increase in seizures is changing dosing practice. Tissueand synovial fluidtranexamic acid concentrations match those in plasma, whereas cerebrospinal fluid concentration reaches approximately 10% of plasma concentration. Concentrations will, however, remain high for a longer period in tissue than in plasma, possibly because of strong binding to plasminogen, and time to peak concentration and retention time may vary among tissues.

The lowest effective concentration for local use is unknown. It is also unclear whether topical effect is determined by drug concentration, total drug dose, and/or a combination of concentration and contact time. In a meta-analysis by Montroy et al. on topical use of tranexamic acid, the effect on transfusion needs was not affected by dose; drug concentrations ranged from 1 to 100 mg/ml. Even the lowest concentration of 1 mg/ml solution will expose the wound surface to a concentration 100-fold stronger than what is considered the lowest inhibitory concentration in plasma. The effect of tranexamic acid may possibly be achieved through both prolonged exposure to low concentrations and short exposure to high concentrations.

Topical use of tranexamic acid is mostly applied at the end of a surgical procedure and, thus, cannot influence perioperative bleeding. Systemic administration of tranexamic acid before the initiation of surgery may be preferred when there is a risk of significant intraoperative hemorrhage, if a clear intraoperative view is essential, or if the procedure itself may trigger hyperfibrinolysis and platelet aggregation (e.g. through the use of cardiopulmonary bypass). When choosing systemic administration of tranexamic acid, adherence to recommended dose would be prudent.

### Prophylactic topical tranexamic acid versus placebo in surgical patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis ∗ [^fcd0a3e4]. Annals of Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Perioperative bleeding remains a major concern to all clinicians caring for perioperative patients. Due to the theoretical risk of thromboembolic events associated with tranexamic acid (TXA) when administered intravenously, topical route of TXA has been extensively studied, but its safety and efficacy profile remain unclear in the literature. The primary aim of this review was to assess the effect of topical TXA on incidence of blood transfusion and mortality in adults undergoing surgery.

Data Sources

EMBASE, MEDLINE, CENTRAL, and ISI Web of Science were systematically searched from their inception until May 31, 2019.

Review Methods

Parallel-arm randomized controlled trials were included.

Results

Seventy-one trials (7539 participants: orthopedics 5450 vs nonorthopedics 1909) were included for quantitative meta-analysis. In comparison to placebo, topical TXA significantly reduced intraoperative blood loss [mean difference (MD) -36.83 mL, 95% confidence interval (CI) -54.77 to -18.88, P < 0.001], total blood loss (MD -319.55 mL, 95% CI -387.42 to -251.69, P < 0.001), and incidence of blood transfusion [odds ratio (OR) 0.30, 95% CI 0.26–0.34, P < 0.001]. Patients who received topical TXA were associated with a shorter length of hospital stay (MD -0.28 days, 95% CI -0.47 to -0.08, P = 0.006). No adverse events associated with the use of topical TXA were observed, namely mortality (OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.45–1.36, P = 0.39), pulmonary embolism (OR 0.73, 95% CI 0.27–1.93, P = 0.52), deep vein thrombosis (OR 1.07, 95% CI 0.65–1.77, P = 0.79), myocardial infarction (OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.21–2.99, P = 0.73), and stroke (OR 0.85, 95% CI 0.28–2.57, P = 0.77). Of all included studies, the risk of bias assessment was "low" for 20 studies, "unclear" for 26 studies and "high" for 25 studies.

Conclusions

In the meta-analysis of 71 trials (7539 patients), topical TXA reduced the incidence of blood transfusion without any notable adverse events associated with TXA in adults undergoing surgery.

### Outcome impact of different tranexamic acid regimens in cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (OPTIMAL): rationale, design, and study protocol of a multicenter randomized controlled trial [^6d15a696]. American Heart Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Tranexamic acid (TxA) reduces perioperative blood transfusion in cardiac surgery; however, the optimal dose of TxA remains unknown. METHODS AND RESULTS: This large-scale, double-blind, randomized controlled trial with a 1-year follow-up enrolls patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass. Patients are randomly assigned 1:1 into either the high-dose TxA group (intravenous bolus [30 mg/kg] after anesthesia followed by intravenous maintenance [16 mg/kg/h] throughout the operation, and a pump prime dose of 2 mg/kg) or the low-dose TxA group (intravenous bolus and maintenance are 10 mg/kg and 2 mg/kg/h, respectively, and a pump prime dose of 1 mg/kg). The primary efficacy end point is the rate of perioperative allogeneic red blood cell (RBC) transfusion defined as the number (%) of patients who will receive at least 1 RBC unit from operation day to discharge. The primary safety end point is the 30-day rate of the composite of perioperative seizures, renal dysfunction, myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and all-cause mortality. The secondary end points are perioperative allogeneic RBC transfusion volume, the non-RBC blood transfusion rate, postoperative bleeding, reoperation rate, mechanical ventilation duration, intensive care unit stay, hospital length of stay, total hospitalization cost, each component of composite primary safety end point, and the 6-month/1-year follow-up mortality and morbidity. We estimated a sample size of 3,008 participants. CONCLUSIONS: The study is designed to identify a TxA dose with maximal efficacy and minimal complications. We hypothesize that the high dose has superior efficacy and noninferior safety to the low dose.

### Current evidence and future directions of tranexamic acid use, efficacy, and dosing for major surgical procedures [^5372efff]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2020). Medium credibility.

Tranexamic acid reduces blood loss and transfusion requirements with no significant thrombotic adverse effects. Postoperative seizures have been seen in cardiac surgical patients in association with patient (advanced age, underlying neurologic disease, chronic kidney disease); surgical (open cardiac procedures, long bypass times); and drug (high tranexamic acid dose) risk factors. Tranexamic acid dosing regimens should be decreased in patients with chronic kidney dysfunction secondary to reduced clearance and drug accumulation. Optimal dosing for cardiac surgical patients has been recommended. Additional research is required to determine dosing regimens in major noncardiac surgery and plasma concentration levels associated with inducing seizures.

Transfusion rate — — intravenous and topical application

There were 28 trials on intravenous (IV) infusion and 4 trials on topical application of TXA that reported data for transfusion rate. For IV infusion, the use of TXA significantly reduce the need for allogeneic blood transfusion by a relative 30% (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.74, P < 0.00001). Heterogeneity between these trials was moderate (Chi 2 = 29.28, df = 26, P = 0.30; I² = 11%).

For topical application, the use of TXA did not reduce the need for allogeneic blood transfusion (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.20, P = 0.76). Heterogeneity between these trials was low (Chi 2 = 2.18, df = 3, P = 0.54; I² = 0%) (Additional file 11: Figure S8).

Transfusion rate — — bolus and bolus plus continuous infusion

There were 10 trials on bolus infusion and 18 trials on bolus plus continuous infusion of TXA that reported data for transfusion rate. In the 18 trials with 2310 patients that had bolus plus continuous infusion of TXA, the use of TXA significantly reduce the need for allogeneic blood transfusion by a relative 30% (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.76, P < 0.00001). Heterogeneity between these trials was moderate (Chi 2 = 18.92, df = 17, P = 0.33; I² = 10%).

In the 10 trials with 5828 patients on bolus injection of TXA, the use of TXA significantly reduce the need for allogeneic blood transfusion by a relative 31% (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.74, P < 0.00001). Heterogeneity between these trials was moderate (Chi 2 = 15.05, df = 9, P = 0.09; I² = 40%) (Fig. 9).

### Tranexamic acid for reducing mortality in emergency and urgent surgery [^53a5558a]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Emergency or urgent surgery, which can be defined as surgery which must be done promptly to save life, limb, or functional capacity, is associated with a high risk of bleeding and death. Antifibrinolytic agents, such as tranexamic acid, inhibit blood clot breakdown (fibrinolysis) and can reduce perioperative bleeding. Tranexamic acid has been shown to reduce the need for a blood transfusion in adult patients undergoing elective surgery but its effects in patients undergoing emergency or urgent surgery is unclear.

Objectives

To assess the effects of tranexamic acid on mortality, blood transfusion and thromboembolic events in adults undergoing emergency or urgent surgery.

Search Methods

We searched the following electronic databases: the Cochrane Injuries Group's Specialised Register (22 August 2012); Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (2012, issue 8 of 12); MEDLINE (Ovid SP) 1950 to August Week 2, 2012; PubMed 1 June 2012 to 22 August 2012; EMBASE (Ovid SP) 1980 to 2012 Week 33; ISI Web of Science: Conference Proceedings Citation Index-Science (CPCI-S) 1990 to 22 August 2012; ISI Web of Science: Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED) 1970 to 22 August 2012. We also searched online trial registers on 22 August 2012 to identify unpublished studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing tranexamic acid with no tranexamic acid or placebo in adults undergoing emergency or urgent surgery.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors examined titles, abstracts and keywords of citations from the electronic databases for eligibility and extracted data for analysis and risk of bias assessment. Outcome measures of interest were mortality, receipt of a blood transfusion, units of blood transfused, reoperation, seizures and thromboembolic events (myocardial infarction, stroke, deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism).

Main Results

We identified five trials involving 372 people that met the inclusion criteria. Three trials (260 patients) contributed data to the analyses. The effect of tranexamic acid on mortality (RR 1.01; 95% CI 0.14 to 7.3) is uncertain. However, tranexamic acid reduces the probability of receiving a blood transfusion by 30% although the estimate is imprecise (RR 0.70; 95% CI 0.52 to 0.94). The effect on deep venous thrombosis (RR 2.29; 95% CI 0.68 to 7.66), and stroke (RR 2.79; 95% CI 0.12 to 67.10) is uncertain. There were no events of pulmonary embolism or myocardial infarction. None of the trials reported units of blood transfused, reoperation, or seizure outcomes.

Authors' Conclusions

There is evidence that tranexamic acid reduces blood transfusion in patients undergoing emergency or urgent surgery. There is a need for a large pragmatic clinical trial to assess the effects of routine use of tranexamic acid on mortality in a heterogeneous group of urgent and emergency surgical patients.

### Different dose regimes and administration methods of tranexamic acid in cardiac surgery: a meta-analysis of randomized trials [^5e8c6291]. BMC Anesthesiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Heterogeneity in transfusion rate existed between trials (I 2 = 49%). From subgroup analysis, we can see that heterogeneity mainly came from intravenous and topical delivery method (intravenous I² = 11%, topical I² = 0%, subgroup differences P < 0.00001).

There was significant heterogeneity in transfusion volume (transfusion volume for all patients I² = 92%, transfusion volume for transfused patients I² = 94%) and postoperative blood loss(I 2 = 97%). Topical and intravenous delivery explained part of the problem, but we believe that heterogeneity mainly came from two reasons. For transfusion volume, different studies varied in measurement of blood, some used mL and some used blood unit which was different depending on different countries. For blood loss, studies varied in the time point in measuring postoperative blood loss, form 4 h to the several days. These sources of heterogeneity were hard to solve by subgroup analysis, and we thus used the random-effect model to estimate the average effect of TXA delivery on these outcomes.

Seizure-high and low dose regimen

Among the 49 studies included, only 8 trials provided data on seizure attack. Since there were too few studies on seizure, we combined bolus with bolus plus continuous infusion together when analyzing high and low dose regimen(< 50 mg/kg or ≤ 10 mg/kg + 1 mg/kg/h). Five trials on high dose regimen and 3 trials on low dose regimen were analyzed.

In the 5 high-dose trials with 5807 patients, the use of high-dosage TXA significantly increased the risk of seizure attack by 4.83 times (RR 4.83, 95% CI 1.75 to 13.33, P = 0.002). Heterogeneity between these trials was low (Chi 2 = 1.37, df = 2, P = 0.50; I² = 0%). In the 3 low-dosage trials with 313 patients, no seizure occurred in any of the trials, and the impact of low-dosage TXA on seizure attack could not be assessed (Fig. 11).

Fig. 11
high and low dose regimen-seizure

Impact of trial quality

We did a subgroup analysis on transfusion rate for studies with low and unclear risk of bias only and found that the use of TXA reduced the rate of allogeneic blood transfusion by a relative 29% (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.75, P < 0.00001). Heterogeneity between these trials was significant (Chi 2 = 59.50, df = 27, P = 0.0003; I² = 55%) (Additional file 12: Figure S9). This result was largely the same with results including all studies. Excluding trials with high risk of bias didn't make a difference.

Publication bias

Funnel plot comparing TXA with control group concerning transfusion rate was provided in Additional file 13: Figure S10. No obvious asymmetry was seen from the funnel plot, and thus no publication bias was detected.

### Topical application of tranexamic acid for the reduction of bleeding [^8d4b65c0]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Intravenous tranexamic acid reduces bleeding in surgery, however, its effect on the risk of thromboembolic events is uncertain and an increased risk remains a theoretical concern. Because there is less systemic absorption following topical administration, the direct application of tranexamic acid to the bleeding surface has the potential to reduce bleeding with minimal systemic effects.

Objectives

To assess the effects of the topical administration of tranexamic acid in the control of bleeding.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Injuries Group Specialised Register; Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library; Ovid MEDLINE®, Ovid MEDLINE® In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE® Daily and Ovid OLDMEDLINE®; Embase Classic + Embase (OvidSP); PubMed and ISI Web of Science (including Science Citation Index Expanded and Social Science Citation Index (SCI-EXPANDED & CPCI-S)). We also searched online trials registers to identify ongoing or unpublished trials. The search was run on the 31st May 2013.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing topical tranexamic acid with no topical tranexamic acid or placebo in bleeding patients.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors examined the titles and abstracts of citations from the electronic databases for eligibility. Two authors extracted the data and assessed the risk of bias for each trial. Outcome measures of interest were blood loss, mortality, thromboembolic events (myocardial infarction, stroke, deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism) and receipt of a blood transfusion.

Main Results

We included 29 trials involving 2612 participants. Twenty-eight trials involved patients undergoing surgery and one trial involved patients with epistaxis (nosebleed). Tranexamic acid (TXA) reduced blood loss by 29% (pooled ratio 0.71, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.69 to 0.72; P < 0.0001). There was uncertainty regarding the effect on death (risk ratio (RR) 0.28, 95% CI 0.06 to 1.34; P = 0.11), myocardial infarction (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.04 to 3.08; P = 0.33), stroke (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.01 to 7.96; P = 0.49), deep vein thrombosis (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.57; P = 0.38) and pulmonary embolism (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.09 to 3.15; P = 0.48). TXA reduced the risk of receiving a blood transfusion by a relative 45% (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.46; P < 0.0001). There was substantial statistical heterogeneity between trials for the blood loss and blood transfusion outcomes.

Authors' Conclusions

There is reliable evidence that topical application of tranexamic acid reduces bleeding and blood transfusion in surgical patients, however the effect on the risk of thromboembolic events is uncertain. The effects of topical tranexamic acid in patients with bleeding from non-surgical causes has yet to be reliably assessed. Further high-quality trials are warranted to resolve these uncertainties before topical tranexamic acid can be recommended for routine use.

Lysine analogues vs placebo — large RCT data support tranexamic acid (TXA) efficacy with dosing change mid-trial and provide safety signals. In a 2017 randomized trial of 4631 patients, TXA 100 mg/kg after induction (reduced to 50 mg/kg after 1392 patients) decreased the need for RBCs and any blood product (both P < .001), yielded a number needed to treat of 6 for reducing transfusion of 1 unit, and lowered reexploration (4.1% vs 2.8%; RR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.32–0.75; P = 0.001), without significant benefit for 30-day mortality or thromboembolic events, while raising questions about an association with seizures.

### The current place of tranexamic acid in the management of bleeding [^8c90d793]. Anaesthesia (2015). Low credibility.

There has been an explosion of interest in the ability of tranexamic acid to reduce morbidity and mortality in surgical and traumatic bleeding. Tranexamic acid has been shown to reduce mortality due to traumatic bleeding by a third, without apparent safety issues. It is now clearly established that intravenous tranexamic acid reduces blood loss in patients with surgical bleeding and the need for transfusion. It can also be used topically to reduce bleeding. Its use is being explored further in large pragmatic trials in traumatic head injury, postpartum haemorrhage and in upper gastro-intestinal haemorrhage. There are few side effects from the use of tranexamic acid except when administered in high dose where neurological events have been noted, possibly relating to tranexamic acid interfering with cerebral GABA and glycine receptors. However, clinical studies suggest that there is no increased efficacy in using a higher dose, and that a dose of 1 g intravenously in an adult patient has maximal efficacy, which is not increased by higher doses. The CRASH-2 trauma trial clearly showed no increase in thrombotic events after its use in trauma, indeed there was a significant reduction in myocardial infarction. However, trials of tranexamic acid in surgery have failed to adequately study its effects on the risk of postoperative venous and possible reduction in arterial thrombo-embolism, and this needs to be the subject of future research.

### Different dose regimes and administration methods of tranexamic acid in cardiac surgery: a meta-analysis of randomized trials [^2b7e2b68]. BMC Anesthesiology (2019). Medium credibility.

From subgroup analysis, we can conclude that low-dose intravenous TXA, no matter delivered as bolus injection or bolus plus continuous infusion, was effective in reducing transfusion requirements. When comparing with high-dose regimen, lose-dose TXA was at least equally effective, and may be even more effective in reducing transfusion rate. The risk ratio for transfusion rate were 0.50 and 0.61 for low-dose bolus and bolus plus continuous infusion separately, while for high-dose regimen risk ratio was 0.71 and 0.69 separately. As we mentioned above, the use of TXA was significantly associated with an increase in seizure attack. In subgroup analysis, TXA increased the risk of seizure only in patients using high-dose regimen, and none of the patients using low-dose TXA had seizure attack. These evidences give us the basic consumption that low-dose TXA is enough in reducing transfusion requirement and is less likely to cause seizure.

### Prophylactic intravenous tranexamic acid and thromboembolism in non-cardiac surgery: a systematic review, meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis [^3f3a8aa1]. Anaesthesia (2023). Medium credibility.

Tranexamic acid is an antifibrinolytic drug that is widely used during surgery, but there are concerns about its thromboembolic effects. We aimed to investigate the effect of prophylactic intravenous tranexamic acid on thromboembolic outcomes in patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery. The MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched. Randomised controlled trials comparing intravenous tranexamic acid with placebo or no treatment in patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery were included. The primary outcome was a composite of peri-operative cardiovascular thromboembolic events, defined as any deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, myocardial ischaemia/infarction or cerebral ischaemia/infarction. A total of 191 randomised controlled trials (40,621 patients) were included in the review. The primary outcome occurred in 4.5% of patients receiving intravenous tranexamic acid compared with 4.9% of patients in the control group. Our analysis showed that there was no difference between groups for composite cardiovascular thromboembolic events (risk ratio 1.02, 95%CI 0.94–1.11, p = 0.65, I 2 0%, n = 37,512). This finding remained robust when sensitivity analysis was performed with continuity correction and in studies with a low risk of bias. However, in trial sequential analysis, our meta-analysis only achieved 64.6% of the required information size. There was no association between intravenous tranexamic acid and seizure rate or mortality rate within 30days. Intravenous tranexamic acid was associated with a reduced blood transfusion rate compared with control (9.9% vs. 19.4%, risk ratio 0.46, 95%CI 0.41–0.51, p < 0.0001). It was encouraging to see the evidence that the administration of intravenous tranexamic in patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery was not associated with an increased risk of thromboembolic outcomes. However, our trial sequential analysis demonstrated that currently available evidence is not yet sufficient to reach a firm conclusion.

### Systematic review and meta-analysis of topical tranexamic acid in spine surgery [^b0ac3c39]. Neurosurgical Focus (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

Tranexamic acid (TXA) is an antifibrinolytic drug associated with reduced blood loss in a range of surgical specialties, including neurosurgery, orthopedic surgery, and cardiac surgery. Concerns about venous thromboembolism and seizures from intravenous (IV) TXA have led to increased use of topical TXA. Given the relative scarcity of the literature on topical TXA compared with that on IV TXA within neurosurgery, the authors aimed to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis on the safety, efficacy, and optimal administration of topical TXA in a wide range of spinal procedures and pathologies.

Methods

The PRISMA guidelines, Cochrane risk of bias tool, and Newcastle-Ottawa Scale were used to extract randomized controlled trials and high-quality case-control and cross-sectional/cohort studies (adult studies only) from PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and Embase published between 2016 and 2023. Studies were analyzed by two independent reviewers for variables including dosage, TXA administration route, type of spine procedure, blood loss, adverse events including thromboembolism and infection, postoperative hemoglobin level, and hospitalization length. Pooled analysis comparing intraoperative and postoperative blood loss, postoperative hemoglobin levels, and hospitalization length of stay on the basis of route of TXA administration was conducted.

Results

Four cohort studies, 1 cross-sectional study, 1 case-control study, and 12 randomized controlled trials, together involving 2045 patients, were included. The most common route of topical TXA administration was via TXA in saline solution. Other routes of topical TXA included retrograde injection and TXA-soaked Gelfoam. In pooled analysis, topical TXA significantly reduced visible blood loss (standardized mean difference [SMD] -0.22, 95% CI -0.45 to -0.00001), postoperative blood loss (SMD -1.63, 95% CI -2.03 to -1.22), and length of hospital stay (SMD -1.02, 95% CI -1.42 to -0.61), as well as higher postoperative hemoglobin (SMD 0.59, 95% CI 0.34–0.83), compared with non-TXA controls. No significant differences in outcomes were found between topical and IV TXA or between combined (topical and IV) and IV TXA. Thromboembolism and infection rates did not significantly differ between any TXA administration group and non-TXA controls.

Conclusions

In pooled analyses, topical TXA was associated with decreased perioperative blood loss in a wide range of scenarios, including cervical spine surgery and thoracolumbar trauma, as well as in patients with a thromboembolic history.

### Safety and efficacy of tranexamic acid in general surgery [^210d7f5e]. JAMA Surgery (2025). High credibility.

The study POISE-3 (subgroup analysis) was published by Lily J Park and colleagues in 2025 in the journal JAMA Surg. This study is related to the following diseases: Perioperative bleeding. In the POISE-3 (subgroup analysis) study, the trial question was: what is the effect of prophylactic tranexamic acid for the prevention of major bleeding in patients undergoing general surgery procedures? In the POISE-3 (subgroup analysis) study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the POISE-3 (subgroup analysis) study, the population was: 3260 patients (1520 female, 1740 male). The inclusion criteria were patients undergoing general surgery procedures. The key exclusion criteria were cardiac surgery; intracranial neurosurgery; planned use of systemic tranexamic acid during surgery; low-risk surgical procedure; hypersensitivity or allergy to tranexamic acid; seizure disorder; recent stroke, myocardial infarction, acute arterial thrombosis, or VTE. In the POISE-3 (subgroup analysis) study, the interventions were: n = 1635 tranexamic acid (prophylactic 1 g intravenous bolus of tranexamic acid given at the start and end of surgery) n = 1625 placebo (1 g 0.9% normal saline at the start and end of surgery). In the POISE-3 (subgroup analysis) study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in composite outcome of life-threatening bleeding, major bleeding, or bleeding into a critical organ at 30 days (8% vs. 10.5%; HR 0.74, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.93). In the POISE-3 (subgroup analysis) study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in life-threatening bleeding at 30 days (1.5% vs. 1.5%; HR 0.99, 99% CI 0.57 to 1.73) Significant decrease in major bleeding at 30 days (6.7% vs. 9.4%; HR 0.71, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.9) No significant difference in critical organ bleeding at 30 days (0.2% vs. 0.1%; HR 1.98, 95% CI 0.36 to 10.8). In the POISE-3 (subgroup analysis) study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in cardiovascular and thromboembolic events at 30 days. In the POISE-3 (subgroup analysis) study, the conclusion was: in patients undergoing general surgery procedures, tranexamic acid was superior to placebo with respect to the composite outcome of life-threatening bleeding, major bleeding, or bleeding into a critical organ at 30 days.

### Efficacy and safety of tranexamic acid in cardiac surgery: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^28521f26]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Surgical trauma and cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) during cardiac surgery can lead to the destruction of coagulation factors and platelets, inhibition of platelet function, and subsequent hyperfibrinolysis, which collectively contribute to an increased risk of perioperative bleeding, allogeneic blood product transfusion, and the need for secondary thoracotomy to control bleeding. Moreover, blood transfusion and secondary thoracotomy are strongly associated with poor prognosis in cardiac surgery patients. Anti-fibrinolytic medications effectively inhibit plasmin activation and preserve platelet function, thereby reducing postoperative bleeding. Through reversibly binding to the lysine-binding sites of plasminogen and plasmin, tranexamic acid prevents plasmin from binding to the lysine residues of fibrin, thereby inhibiting fibrinolysis. Additionally, tranexamic acid further protects platelet function by attenuating the effect of plasmin on platelet glycoprotein Ib receptors.

Although tranexamic acid is widely recognized for its efficacy in reducing bleeding and blood transfusion requirements during cardiac surgery, the optimal dosing regimen remains uncertain. A high-quality clinical trial previously demonstrated that a regimen of 10 mg/kg followed by 1 mg/kg/h over 12 h effectively reduced bleeding and transfusion risks, with no additional hemostatic benefit observed at higher doses. Based on pharmacokinetic modeling, some researchers have proposed regimens targeting specific plasma concentrations of tranexamic acid, which in vitro studies have shown to completely inhibit fibrinolysis. These regimens involve substantial doses, such as 30 mg/kg followed by 16 mg/kg/h during surgery, with 2 mg/kg added to the pump prime, or a preoperative bolus of 100 mg/kg. The relationship between in vivo drug concentrations, fibrinolytic inhibition and blood loss reduction has not been definitively established. Furthermore, tranexamic acid seemed to be associated with an increased risk of postoperative seizures that were believed to be dose-related. Myles et al. reported a prospective, randomized trial of TXA versus placebo and found that patients receiving a TXA dose of 50 or 100 mg/kg had a significantly higher rate of seizures (0.7%) when compared to placebo (0.1%) (P = 0.002). A 2019 meta-analysis found that lower dose TXA equally decreased transfusion requirements compared to higher dose TXA. However, the higher dose group had a 4.83 times higher risk of seizures than the lower dose group. Determining the optimal dose of TXA administration during cardiac surgery remains a challenge.

### Tranexamic acid in patients undergoing coronary-artery surgery [^367782b8]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2017). Excellent credibility.

Background

Tranexamic acid reduces the risk of bleeding among patients undergoing cardiac surgery, but it is unclear whether this leads to improved outcomes. Furthermore, there are concerns that tranexamic acid may have prothrombotic and proconvulsant effects.

Methods

In a trial with a 2-by-2 factorial design, we randomly assigned patients who were scheduled to undergo coronary-artery surgery and were at risk for perioperative complications to receive aspirin or placebo and tranexamic acid or placebo. The results of the tranexamic acid comparison are reported here. The primary outcome was a composite of death and thrombotic complications (nonfatal myocardial infarction, stroke, pulmonary embolism, renal failure, or bowel infarction) within 30 days after surgery.

Results

Of the 4662 patients who were enrolled and provided consent, 4631 underwent surgery and had available outcomes data; 2311 were assigned to the tranexamic acid group and 2320 to the placebo group. A primary outcome event occurred in 386 patients (16.7%) in the tranexamic acid group and in 420 patients (18.1%) in the placebo group (relative risk, 0.92; 95% confidence interval, 0.81 to 1.05; P = 0.22). The total number of units of blood products that were transfused during hospitalization was 4331 in the tranexamic acid group and 7994 in the placebo group (P < 0.001). Major hemorrhage or cardiac tamponade leading to reoperation occurred in 1.4% of the patients in the tranexamic acid group and in 2.8% of the patients in the placebo group (P = 0.001), and seizures occurred in 0.7% and 0.1%, respectively (P = 0.002 by Fisher's exact test).

Conclusions

Among patients undergoing coronary-artery surgery, tranexamic acid was associated with a lower risk of bleeding than was placebo, without a higher risk of death or thrombotic complications within 30 days after surgery. Tranexamic acid was associated with a higher risk of postoperative seizures.

### Serum concentrations and pharmacokinetics of tranexamic acid after two means of topical administration in massive weight loss skin-reducing surgery [^0c2cceb3]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Tranexamic acid passes the blood-brain barrier, reaching a concentration in cerebrospinal fluid of approximately 10% of that in plasma, although the degree of passage may vary considerably. A plasma level of 5 µg/ml after topical application may thus cause a concentration of approximately 0.5 to 1 µg/ml in the brain. As a cerebrospinal fluid concentration of at least 15 µg/ml has been necessary in experimental settings to increase the excitatory potential of tranexamic acid, it is highly unlikely that a concentration of approximately 0.5 to 1 µg/ml may precipitate seizures. However, caution may be warranted should topical solutions come in direct contact with the central nervous system. Studies from topical use in spine surgery have not addressed this issue, and the possibility of seizures is not common knowledge outside of the cardiac surgery community. Any topical use in neurosurgery should be discouraged, as accidental intrathecal administration in humans – and direct topical application to the central nervous system in animal studies – have caused seizures.

Our findings after intravenous administration of 1 g of tranexamic acid are in accordance with earlier pharmacokinetic data. – Concentrations remained above 10 µg/ml for approximately 2.5 hours, which was well beyond the end of surgery in all patients.

The topical bolus group presented heterogeneous results both for the total amount of absorbed drug and for its elimination (Fig. 1, center) (see Figure, Supplemental Digital Content 4). Interindividual differences regarding the extent to which the drains actually eliminated the instilled fluids, patient mobility to stir up and distribute fluids, and wound cavity topography with nooks and crevices where fluid deposits reside are all factors that may add to the heterogeneity of this group. In four subjects in this group, the absorption was particularly low and irregular during the approximately 20 hours we followed them with serum concentrations measurements. Consequently, the area under the time–serum concentration curve calculations were uncertain because of a considerable degree of extrapolation; also, the elimination half-life, clearance, mean residence time, and volume of distribution values were correspondingly affected. We therefore present median values for these variables in this group in Table 1.

### Different dose regimes and administration methods of tranexamic acid in cardiac surgery: a meta-analysis of randomized trials [^7aca29d8]. BMC Anesthesiology (2019). Medium credibility.

There were several studies that directly compared the effectiveness of high and low-dose regimen of TXA, but the definition of high and low-dose regimen varied significantly among these studies, we thus consider it improper to combine the results together in meta-analysis. Here we did a qualitative other than quantitative analysis of these studies and see if they were in accordance with our basic consumption.

We identified 6 RCTs that compare transfusion rate between high and low dose regimen, and none of them showed significant decrease in transfusion rate in the high dose group. Fewer studies reported data on transfusion volume, again no significant decrease were found in allogeneic RBC transfusion in the high dose group. These results agreed with our previous findings. In terms of postoperative blood loss, the results were less unanimous. We found 8 RCTs comparing blood loss between high and low dose regimen, among which 5 studies reported no difference in blood loss. Karski et al. randomly assigned patients to receive 50, 100 or 150 mg/kg of TXA infusion and found that blood loss was significantly higher in the 50 mg/kg group. Jiménez et al. reported blood loss to be significantly reduced in patients who received 80 mg/kg TXA compared with patients who received 40 mg/kg TXA. Sigaut et al. (71)found that blood loss was significantly reduced when 30 mg/kg + 16 mg/kg/h of TXA was infused compared with 10 mg/kg + 1 mg/kg/h of TXA. We identified 3 studies that reported data on seizure, and none of them found significant difference between the high and low-dose group, but there was a trend towards more seizure attack. Jiménez et al. reported seizure rate to be 2/80 in the high-dose group and 0/80 in the low dose group. Sigaut et al. found that seizure happened in 3 out of 285 patients in the high dose group and 1 out of 284 patients in the low dose group. In the study conducted by Du et al. seizure rate were 1/87 and 1/88 in high and low dose group separately, and the dose regimen used in their study were 30 mg/kg + 16 mg/kg/h for high-dose and 10 mg/kg + 2 mg/kg/h for low-dose regimen. From these trials which directly compared high and low dose TXA, we can conclude that high dose TXA has little effect in reducing transfusion requirement and tends to cause more seizure attacks, but it may be more effective in reducing blood loss compared to low dose regimen.

Risk of bias assessment

All included studies were assessed for methodological quality by two authors independently. We used the Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing risk of bias (Version 5.1.0) as evaluation criteria. The following domains were assessed for each study: random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of participants and personnel, blinding of outcome assessment, incomplete outcome data addressed and selective reporting. Each domain for every included study was graded into three categories: low risk of bias, unclear risk of bias and high risk of bias.

Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity

Analysis of a-priori subgroups was performed according to the following factors: type of surgery, usage of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), intravenous or topical application of TXA, bolus or continuous infusion of TXA, and TXA dosage.

Statistical analysis

For dichotomous outcomes (transfusion rate, re-operation rate, incidence of adverse effects), we calculated relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). For continuous outcomes (post-operative blood loss or transfusion volume) reported as mean and standard deviation, the mean difference (MD) for the pooled estimates with 95% CI was calculated. The fixed-effect model was used for analysis with no heterogeneity(I 2 = 0), and random-effect model was used for analysis with heterogeneity (I 2 > 0%). For outcomes with heterogeneity, an effort was made to identify its source, mainly through subgroup analysis. A P -value less than or equal to 0.05 for the Q statistic was used to define statistically significant heterogeneity. Statistical heterogeneity was also assessed using the I 2 test. I² = 0–40%: heterogeneity might not be important; I² = 30–60%: may represent moderate heterogeneity; I² = 50 to 90%: may represent substantial heterogeneity; I² = 75 to 100%: considerable heterogeneity. P < 0.05 (2-sided) was considered statistically significant for the hypothesis testing. The publication bias was visualized by symmetry of funnel plot. All statistical analyses were performed in RevMan (version5.0; Cochrane Collaboration, Oxford, UK) and Stata (version 9.0; Stata Corporation, College Station, TX).

### Tranexamic acid in cardiac surgery: is there a cause for concern? [^46982150]. Critical Care (2010). Low credibility.

The withdrawal of marketing approval for aprotinin resulted in more clinicians administering tranexamic acid to patients at increased risk of bleeding and adverse outcome. The latest in a series of retrospective analyses of observational data is published in Critical Care and suggests an increase in mortality, when compared to data from the aprotinin era, in those patients having surgery when a cardiac chamber is opened. The added observation of an increase in cerebral excitatory phenomena (seizure activity) with tranexamic acid has a known mechanism and questions if such patients should be given this drug.

### Update on applications and limitations of perioperative tranexamic acid [^d0b97c8a]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2022). Medium credibility.

Tranexamic acid (TXA) is a potent antifibrinolytic with documented efficacy in reducing blood loss and allogeneic red blood cell transfusion in several clinical settings. With a growing emphasis on patient blood management, TXA has become an integral aspect of perioperative blood conservation strategies. While clinical applications of TXA in the perioperative period are expanding, routine use in select clinical scenarios should be supported by evidence for efficacy. Furthermore, questions regarding optimal dosing without increased risk of adverse events such as thrombosis or seizures should be answered. Therefore, ongoing investigations into TXA utilization in cardiac surgery, obstetrics, acute trauma, orthopedic surgery, neurosurgery, pediatric surgery, and other perioperative settings continue. The aim of this review is to provide an update on the current applications and limitations of TXA use in the perioperative period.

### Effect of tranexamic acid on surgical bleeding: systematic review and cumulative meta-analysis [^6a80cdc2]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Results

Overall, 127 articlesdescribing 129 randomised controlled trials and totalling 10 488 patients were included; 5484 of these patients were allocated to tranexamic acid and 5004 to a control group (fig 1). The median sample size was 60 (range 10–660) patients. In total, 126 (98%) trials were in elective surgery and three (2%) in emergency surgery. Eleven (8%) trials involved children.

Fig 1 Selection of trials for review

The authors of 86 trials were contacted for missing data, 39 of whom provided additional information. Data were available on blood transfusion from 95 (74%) trials, on myocardial infarction from 73 (56%), on stroke from 71 (55%), on deep vein thrombosis from 72 (56%), on pulmonary embolism from 66 (51%), and on mortality from 72 (56%). Seven (5%) trials did not present any data on the outcome measures of interest to this review or reported data in a format that was unsuitable for inclusion in the analyses.

A further 14 ongoing trials were identified, with a median planned sample size of 130 patients. The 14 trials were in orthopaedic (n = 5), cardiac (n = 4), cranial (n = 2), hepatic (n = 1), ear, nose, and throat (n = 1), and gynaecological (n = 1) surgery. In 12 of the 14 trials blood transfusion was a main outcome measure.

### Effect of two doses of tranexamic acid on fibrinolysis evaluated by thromboelastography during cardiac surgery: a randomised, controlled study [^857cdc28]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Tranexamic acid is used to decrease bleeding and transfusions during cardiac surgery. However, dosing based on pharmacokinetic data to optimally inhibit fibrinolysis is unknown. With increasing concerns regarding seizures associated with higher doses, lower dosing schemes may be important.

Objective

To determine the effect of two dosing schemes compared with placebo on fibrinolysis and clinical outcomes.

Design

A double-blind, randomised, controlled, pilot trial.

Setting

Single tertiary centre.

Patients

Cardiac surgery patients requiring cardiopulmonary bypass.

Intervention

Patients were randomised to receive a 30mg kg(-1) bolus and continuous infusion of 16 mg kg(-1) h(-1) (Group HIGH), a 5mg kg(-1) bolus followed by 5mg kg(-1) h(-1) (Group LOW) or Sodium chloride (Placebo).

Main Outcome Measure

Fibrinolysis was evaluated by thromboelastography and D-dimers. Secondary endpoints were blood loss, transfusion requirement and side effects.

Results

Thirty-three patients were included. Significant fibrinolysis was defined by LY30 more than 7.5% based on thromboelastography and was not observed after cardiopulmonary bypass in any groups. After protamine administration, LY30 differences between groups were 0.7 [95% confidence interval (95% CI) -0.04 to 1.4] between Groups HIGH and Placebo, -0.08 (95% CI -0.82 to 0.66) between Groups HIGH and LOW, and 0.78 (95% CI 0.02 to 1.5) between Groups LOW and Placebo. A significant increase in D-dimers was observed in the Group Placebo compared with the two treatment groups. There were no differences in bleeding or transfusion requirement.

Conclusion

In this dose-finding study, there were no differences in fibrinolysis or clinical outcomes among the two tranexamic acid schemes and placebo. Any difference in fibrinolytic inhibition requires a larger adequately powered study.

Trial Registration

EudraCT number: 2010-024104-99.

### The impact of administration of tranexamic acid in reducing the use of red blood cells and other blood products in cardiac surgery [^3dca791e]. BMC Anesthesiology (2006). Low credibility.

This evidence was supported in a systematic review on use of antifibrinolytics in minimising the perioperative blood transfusion after any major surgery. The authors reported that tranexamic acid reduced the rate of red blood cell transfusion by 34% (RR 0.66, 95% CI: 0.54–0.81, 18 trials, 1342 patients). In those receiving transfusion, tranexamic acid resulted in a saving of 1.03 units of RBC (95% CI: 0.67 to 1.39). However, the authors highlighted the significant heterogeneity among the trials, some evidence of publication bias and the paucity of collected data.

The common problems highlighted by these various reviewers are the heterogeneity of the study population, heterogeneity of the methods used in the trials (dosing regimen, monitoring of bleeding and coagulation and transfusion trigger) and the small number of patients studied. Though all these reviews showed that tranexamic acid reduced the proportion of patients needing a transfusion, they did not exclusively study the effects of routine use of tranexamic acid for all primary cardiac operations. Further, the results from such meta-analyses must be interpreted with caution as it has been shown in the past that larger, randomised, double blinded studies following meta-analysis have produced contradictory results. For the same reasons, the authors of these reviews recommended conducting large randomised, double blinded, placebo controlled studies. However, no large trial with adequate power to identify the effects of the tranexamic acid administration compared to placebo on transfusion is available.

### Can local application of tranexamic acid reduce post-coronary bypass surgery blood loss? A randomized controlled trial [^1030a267]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Topical use of Tranexamic acid into the pericardial cavity in patients undergoing primary coronary artery bypass grafting significantly reduces postoperative bleeding and platelet transfusion without adding extra risk to the patient. Consequently Tranexamic acid could be advocated for routine use topically in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting.

Clinical Indications, Incidence, and Risk Factors

TXA was originally approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of patients with hemophilia undergoing dental surgery and for women suffering from heavy menstrual bleeding. 36, 37 The clinical indications of TXA have rapidly expanded and now include multiple "off‐label" uses, including cardiac, gastrointestinal, and orthopedic surgery as well as treatment of postpartum hemorrhage. 38, 39, 40, 41 The World Health Organization (WHO) recently included TXA in its "Model List of Essential Medicines". 42 The WHO recommended that TXA be used to reduce blood loss in patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass procedures, in trauma patients with significant hemorrhage, and in patients with postpartum hemorrhage. 42

The broad introduction of TXA into surgical care has resulted in an increased reported incidence of seizures, particularly during the early postoperative period after cardiac surgery. 21 Retrospective analyses have shown that the incidence of seizures in postoperative cardiac patients has increased from 0.5–1.0% to 6.4–7.3% with the use of higher doses of TXA. 8, 17 Additionally, several multicenter retrospective studies confirm increased seizures in postoperative patients who received TXA, with an incidence ranging from 0.9% to 2.5%. 16, 18, 20, 26 A single prospective trial found that seizures occurred in 3% (3 of 100 patients) of post–cardiac surgical patients treated with TXA. 34 Although the incidence of TXA‐associated seizures after cardiac surgery varies between studies, treatment with TXA was a strong independent predictor of seizure. 16, 20, 26

### Different dose regimes and administration methods of tranexamic acid in cardiac surgery: a meta-analysis of randomized trials [^0288b18a]. BMC Anesthesiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Tranexamic acid(TXA)is a lysine analogues which acts principally by blocking the lysine binding sites on plasminogen molecules, inhibiting the formation of plasmin and therefore inhibiting fibrinolysis. The efficacy of TXA to reduce perioperative blood loss and allogeneic blood transfusion has been studied extensively. The latest Cochrane review on TXA was published in 2011, the author concluded that TXA was effective in reducing blood loss and transfusion requirement in multiple kinds of surgeries including cardiac surgery, and appeared to be free of serious adverse effects. However, as an anti-fibrinolytic agent, the prothrombotic effect has always been a concern. TXA could potentially increase the risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, and other thrombotic complications, and has later been shown to increase the risk of neurologic events, especially seizures.

In 2017, Myles et al. published a study on TXA usage in cardiac surgery. In this randomized controlled trial including 4631 patients, the author found that seizures occurred in 0.7 and 0.1% in TXA and placebo group respectively (P = 0.002). This recent study draws further attention to the dosage regimen of TXA, since adverse effects including seizure are possibly dosage-related. The study used a high-dose regimen, in which either 50 mg/kg or 100 mg/kg of TXA was delivered for each patient. There is a possibility that lower dose of TXA can be equally effective while causing less adverse effects. In fact, TXA plasma concentrations required to suppress fibrinolysis and plasmin-induced platelet activation are merely 10 and 16 μg/ml, respectively. This relatively low plasma concentration can be reached in cardiac surgery when 10 mg/kg of TXA is administered as a bolus then followed by continuous infusion of 1 mg kg/h and 1 mg/kg in CPB. But another potential mechanism of TXA action might be the increase in thrombin formation, which requires concentrations more than 126 μg/ml to be effective. 30 mg/kg of TXA administered as a bolus followed by 16 mg/kg/h and 2 mg/kg in CPB prime solution was able to maintain the plasma concentration above 114 μg/ml.

### Perioperative considerations in management of the severely bleeding coagulopathic patient [^3b49d921]. Anesthesiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Activation of the fibrinolytic system is an important component of excessive bleeding in trauma and surgery that leads to activation of the fibrinolytic pathway. Antifibrinolytic agents have been used extensively to prevent or treat fibrinolysis. The antifibrinolytic agents used are the lysine analogs, tranexamic acid, and epsilon aminocaproic acid. Landmark studies showing the effectiveness of tranexamic acid, as measured by a reduction of all-cause mortality or death due to severe bleeding, are the Clinical Randomization of an Antifibrinolyticin Significant Hemorrhage (CRASH) trials in severe trauma and brain injury and the World Maternal Antifibrinolytic (WOMAN) trial in postpartum hemorrhage. – However, the performance and results of the large CRASH-2 study have been a subject of intensive controversial debate, as the reduction in mortality was subtle and transfusion rates in the treatment arm not reduced. It is noteworthy that only half of the patients were transfused, and only a small number of patients required surgery. In cardiac surgery, the Aspirin and Tranexamic Acid for Coronary Artery Surgery (ATACAS) trial showed a reduction of postoperative blood loss and the re-exploration rate in patients having received tranexamic acid compared to those without. However, treatment group patients undergoing open-heart surgery showed an increased rate of convulsive seizures, which, within the ongoing trial, resulted in a significant reduction of the dose from a 100 mg/kg bolus to a 50 mg/kg bolus. The mechanism of this dose-dependent effect of tranexamic acid, which is restricted to open-heart cardiac surgery, is a disinhibition of cerebral γ-aminobutyric acid receptors. In the most recent Outcome Impact of Different Tranexamic Acid Regimens in Cardiac Surgery with Cardiopulmonary Bypass (OPTIMAL) trial in cardiac surgery, established high-dose and low-dose tranexamic acid protocols have been compared. High-dose tranexamic acid (cumulative dose approximately 100 mg/kg) showed a modest increased efficacy, as measured by patients transfused with red blood cells, when compared to the low-dose protocol (cumulative dose approximately 20 mg/kg) and revealed noninferiority in the composite primary safety endpoint consisting of 30-day mortality, seizure, kidney dysfunction, and thrombotic events. However, this study included only patients who were not older than 70 yr, and the mean age in both groups was only 53 yr. In this regard, the elderly patient population, which potentially has a high intraoperative seizure risk, may not have been adequately represented, potentially limiting the validity of the results.

### Different dose regimes and administration methods of tranexamic acid in cardiac surgery: a meta-analysis of randomized trials [^49289e59]. BMC Anesthesiology (2019). Medium credibility.

We found that intravenous delivery of TXA significantly reduced transfusion rate by 30%, while topical application did not show any signs to reduce transfusion requirement. This result can be further confirmed by several studies comparing intravenous plus topical use of TXA with intravenous application alone. In a RCT conducted by Taksaudom et al. 1 g of topical TXA was poured into the pericardial cavity in addition to 1 mg/kg/h of intravenous infusion in the experiment group, and only 1 mg/kg/h of intravenous infusion was applied in the control group. No significant reduction was seen in post-operative blood loss, and transfusion rate was even higher in the experiment group (75.6% vs 70.6%). The same happened for another RCT conducted by Spegar et al. in which 2.5 g topical TXA was applied in addition to 1 g + 400 mg/h of intravenous infusion. According to existing evidence, topical TXA was not effective enough to reduce bleeding and transfusion requirements no matter used alone or combined with intravenous application, and further research is needed to justify its use in cardiac procedures.

Both continuous plus bolus and bolus delivery alone significantly reduced transfusion rate compared to the control group, and bolus plus continuous delivery (RR 0.70) did not seem to be more effective than bolus injection (RR 0.69). In a RCT conducted by Imtiaz, et al. 137 CABG patients were randomly assigned to receive either bolus injection or continuous infusion of 30 mg/kg TXA, and no difference were found in blood loss or transfusion requirements. This result was in accordance with our finding that bolus and bolus plus continuous delivery were equally effective. We infer that both delivery methods are able to keep the effect compartment concentration above minimum effective concentration during surgery as long as dosage is enough, but peak concentration may be higher if bolus injection alone is applied which may cause more adverse events. However, this hypothesis needs to be tested by pharmacokinetics studies.

### Effectiveness and safety of low-dose intraoperative tranexamic acid in cardiac surgery: a retrospective before-and-after study [^34a04b98]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Despite advancements in surgical techniques and perioperative management, postoperative bleeding remains a major challenge in optimizing outcomes in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Various strategies have been explored to prevent and reduce postoperative bleeding. Notably, the widespread and longstanding use of antifibrinolytic agents is considered the most promising pharmacological approach. The so-called "aprotinin saga", initiated by an observational study of Mangano et al. and concluded by the multicenter randomized controlled trial conducted by the BART investigators, led to the withdrawal of aprotinin from most global markets in 2008 due to concerns regarding increased mortality. Consequently, lysine analog antifibrinolytics such as tranexamic acid (TXA) became the mainstay in clinical practice.

TXA is broadly recognized for its role in reducing bleeding and the subsequent need for transfusion in various surgical populations. Current guidelines in North America and Europe recommend its routine use in cardiac surgery. However, an optimal dosing strategy that maximizes effectiveness while minimizing the risk of TXA-related adverse events, such as seizures and thrombotic complications, has not been established. This uncertainty has led to inconsistent adoption of TXA in clinical practice. Furthermore, data and research on this topic in cardiac surgery settings remain limited compared to other clinical contexts.

Through this retrospective before-and-after study, we aimed to evaluate the association of intraoperative low-dose TXA with postoperative bleeding (as a measure of effectiveness), and with TXA-related adverse events (as a measure of safety).

### Transfusion strategies in bleeding critically ill adults: a clinical practice guideline from the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine [^693873ec]. Intensive Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Justification

There is uncertainty as to the effects of viscoelastic in non-massively bleeding cardiac surgery patients on clinically important outcomes. Most treatment effects were observed in outcomes that are particularly susceptible to performance bias, are of limited importance to patients, and demonstrated high heterogeneity. Moreover, most studies included in the systematic review, were at unclear or high risk of bias. Two studies, assessed the resource requirements and cost-effectiveness of this technology in the cardiac surgery population suggesting small cost savings over usual care, but substantial uncertainty remains. The single RCT in patients undergoing ECMO provides only very low certainty evidence for the differences between viscoelastic testing and conventional coagulation testing.

Implementation issues

Despite the very low certainty provided by the available evidence, many centers have adopted the use of viscoelastic testing to guide transfusions, due to perceived efficiency, specificity, and rapidity of testing. However, for centers without viscoelastic testing, resource considerations and staff education needs, would likely play a role in deciding whether it should be adopted, in light of the limited evidence available regarding its impact upon patient outcomes and blood product use.

Part 3. Tranexamic acid (TXA) in bleeding critically ill adults

TXA in patients with traumatic intracranial hemorrhage

Evidence summary

The landmark multi-centre CRASH-2 RCT demonstrated that administration of TXA results in a reduction of death (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.85–0.97; RD − 1.4%, 95% CI − 2.4 to − 0.5, high certainty), with no difference in venous thrombosis, stroke, myocardial infarction or need for surgical intervention. The risk of seizures was not reported, though reassuringly no increase in seizures was noted in the CRASH-3 study, which evaluated the use of TXA in trauma patients with isolated traumatic brain injury.

Justification

Compared to placebo, TXA results in small but clinically meaningful reductions in bleeding death and overall mortality, with trivial undesirable effects. TXA is inexpensive, likely cost-effective, acceptable, and feasible to implement in most settings.

### Efficacy and safety of tranexamic acid in cardiac surgery: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^bf398f05]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Seizures are a well-known adverse event of TXA. There is a dose-dependent reported incidence of seizures ranging from 2.7 to 7.6%, with doses of TA of 100 mg/kg and greater linked to an increased risk of seizures. Most of these studies used a single bolus of TXA. Having a seizure is not trivial, particularly following cardiac surgery: patients who experience seizures are more likely to get postoperative neurological complications, such as stroke or delirium, increased length of stay in intensive care unit, and increased intensive care unit mortality.

### Different dose regimes and administration methods of tranexamic acid in cardiac surgery: a meta-analysis of randomized trials [^faed9f80]. BMC Anesthesiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this meta-analysis, we strengthened the results that TXA significantly reduced blood loss, transfusion requirement and re-operation rate in adult cardiac surgery. In addition to updating previous findings, we tried to answer three important questions: whether TXA is effective for all kinds of elective heart surgeries on adults, whether TXA leads to adverse effects, what's the preferable dose regimen and delivery method for TXA.

We found TXA to be effective for both off-pump and on-pump operations. Although off-pump patients didn't undergo CPB, they were inevitability exposed be heparin, protamine and even greater surgical trauma than on-pump patients, and we found that these patients could benefit as much as, if not more than on-pump patient from TXA.

TXA did not show any trend to increase the risk of thrombotic events including myocardial infarction, stroke and pulmonary embolism, and wasn't associated with renal injury. But TXA significantly increased the risk of seizure, which was a result well worth attention. According to our findings, seizure was a rare event in patients underwent cardiac surgeries. There were 11 studies that reported data on epileptic attack and 7 of them reported no attack in both TXA and control groups. In the other 4 studies, seizure happened at a rate of 0.20–1.08%. Given the rare nature of seizure attack, we consider it valuable to look at results from retrospective observational studies. In an observational study of 12,195 patients underwent cardiac surgery, none of the 886 patients in the control group without TXA administration had seizure and 80 out of 9642 patients (0.83%) with TXA delivery had seizure. Takagai et al. did a meta-analysis on all kinds of researches concerning the association between TXA and seizure in cardiac surgeries. They identified 16 studies with 45,235 patients, and demonstrated that TXA therapy was associated with a statistically significant increase in seizures incidence (OR = 4.13; 95% CI: 2.59 to 6.57; P < 0.00001). A subgroup analysis indicated a significant increase seizure in all subgroups of 5 RCTs, 5 adjusted observational studies, and 6 unadjusted observational studies with no statistically significant subgroup difference (P = 0.36; I² = 1.5%).

### Can local application of tranexamic acid reduce post-coronary bypass surgery blood loss? A randomized controlled trial [^81dbdeeb]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Limitation of the study

We did not measure the level of TA in the serum or in the pericardial cavity. The number of the patients was relatively small and the inclusion criteria with strictly tight. Larger multi-center prospective control trials using larger dose of TA are needed to address its topical effect in procedures with higher risk of bleeding.

### The impact of administration of tranexamic acid in reducing the use of red blood cells and other blood products in cardiac surgery [^e816b1df]. BMC Anesthesiology (2006). Low credibility.

Intriguingly, those studies have all varied in the selected dose of the tranexamic acid to be administered and none established which dose is the most efficacious. Some dosages have been studied, such as 10 mg.kg -1 followed by an infusion of 1 mg.kg -1.h -1, or 20 mg.kg -1 and 100 mg.kg -1 as an intravenous bolus. These recommendations are based on small studies and further, larger, studies to determine the effective dose of tranexamic acid are lacking.

It appears however that a randomised control trial to convince those that remain sceptical of the effect of tranexamic acid is not ethical. Using the available information instead of a randomised, controlled trial to identify a clinical effect or to solve a clinical problem has been described in the literature and may be a more frequent occurrence with the development of the automatic collection of a vast quantity of data at the bedside. This method can be useful if the data collected are reliable and appropriate statistical tests are used for analysis. Moreover, a multitude of risk factors are associated with postoperative bleeding following cardiac surgery and how (or if) they have been controlled for in the randomised control trials is unclear, and groups may ultimately not be matched. A randomised controlled trial accounting for those, and mimicking clinical reality, would be very expensive and would divert a large number of patients from other trials, designed to answer other important clinical questions. In this study, we have used the data collected prospectively to identify the effects of tranexamic acid administration in our routine patient population. Multivariate logistic regression was used to minimise the bias by adjusting for other confounding factors. This study unifies, in a large group of patients, the evidence from randomised controlled trials showing that tranexamic acid administration is an independent factor impacting on the exposure to allogeneic red blood cells, fresh frozen plasma or any blood product and on the return to theatre for re-exploration in patients who underwent a primary cardiac operation.

### Effect of tranexamic acid on thrombotic events and seizures in bleeding patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^9fa4d757]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Sensitivity and subgroup analysis with thrombotic events

In sensitivity and subgroup analysis, we did not find any increase in thrombotic events in trauma (0.89 [0.69–1.17]), obstetrics and gynecology (0.81 [0.53–1.26]), cardiac surgery (0.92 [0.81–1.05]), orthopedic surgery (0.98 [0.80–1.21]) (Fig. 3 A; Additional file 2: Figure S5). However, the risk of thrombotic events appeared higher in the TXA group than in the control group in spontaneous (non-traumatic) intracranial hemorrhage (1.33 [1.09–1.63]) (Fig. 3 A). In a dose-by-dose sensitivity analysis, thrombotic events were not increased in patients receiving 2 g/day of TXA or less (≤ 2 g/day: 0.94 [0.84–1.05]) (Fig. 3 A; Additional file 2: Figure S6). There was uncertainty on thrombotic events in patients receiving more than 2 g/day of TXA (> 2 g/day: 1.18 [0.98–1.43]). Meta-regression analysis showed there was no statistically significant association between higher dose of TXA and increased risk of thrombotic events (p = 0.122) (Fig. 4 A). The results were similar to primary analysis, when the analyses were restricted to trials with low risk of bias (0.98 [0.90–1.06]) and sample size over 500 (0.96 [0.85–1.07]) (Fig. 3 A). Of trials conducted in children, one patient had a thrombotic event in the TXA group, compared to none in the placebo group (Additional file 2: Figure S7).

Lysine antifibrinolytic agents (tranexamic acid [TXA] vs epsilon-aminocaproic acid [EACA]) — In a small randomized controlled trial of 78 patients, reexploration for bleeding was nonsignificantly different among groups (TXA, n = 2; EACA, n = 2; control, n = 3; P > .05). In a retrospective cohort comparing 341 patients in each group, TXA was superior at reducing blood loss (logistic regression OR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.39–0.83; P = 0.003) and in preventing the use of blood products (RBCs, P = 0.02; FFP, P < .001; and platelets, P < .001), and the study also "raises further questions on the association between TXA and seizures". A 2011 retrospective cohort of 604 patients found TXA significantly reduced 24-hour blood loss but did not significantly reduce use of any transfusion products, reexploration, 30-day mortality, or thromboembolic complications.

### The safety and efficiency of intravenous administration of tranexamic acid in coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG): a meta-analysis of 28 randomized controlled trials [^8acefa5b]. BMC Anesthesiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The safety and efficiency of intravenous administration of tranexamic acid (TXA) in coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) remains unconfirmed. Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis on this topic.

Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), PUBMED and EMBASE for randomized controlled trials on the topic. The results of this work are synthetized and reported in accordance with the PRISMA statement.

Results

Twenty-eight studies met our inclusion criteria. TXA reduced the incidence of postoperative reoperation of bleeding (relative risk [RR], 0.46; 95% confidence interval [CI]; 0.31–0.68), the frequency of any allogeneic transfusion (RR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.52–0.78) and the postoperative chest tube drainage in the first 24h by 206ml (95% CI -248.23 to -164.15). TXA did not significantly affect the incidence of postoperative cerebrovascular accident (RR, 0.93; 95%CI, 0.62–1.39), mortality (RR, 0.82; 95%CI, 0.53–1.28), myocardial infarction (RR, 0.90; 95%CI, 0.78–1.05), acute renal insufficiency (RR, 1.01; 95%CI, 0.77–1.32). However, it may increase the incidence of postoperative seizures (RR, 6.67; 95%CI, 1.77–25.20). Moreover, the subgroup analyses in on-pump and off-pump CABG, the sensitivity analyses in trials randomized more than 99 participants and sensitivity analyses that excluded the study with the largest number of participants further strengthened the above results.

Conclusions

TXA is effective to reduce reoperation for bleeding, blood loss and the need for allogeneic blood products in patients undergoing CABG without increasing prothrombotic complication. However, it may increase the risk of postoperative seizures.

### Wider use of tranexamic acid to reduce surgical bleeding could benefit patients and health systems [^9fbab420]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

Are there other potential harms in surgical patients?

High doses of tranexamic acid can cause seizures, but a 1 g preoperative dose is not associated with an increased risk. Inadvertent intrathecal administration of tranexamic acid has serious adverse effects and must be avoided. A history of thromboembolic events is not an absolute contraindication to using tranexamic acid. The drug is excreted by the kidneys, but there is no risk of accumulation with a single preoperative dose. Body weight based dosing can be used in children.

Tranexamic acid may be detrimental in conditions associated with microvascular thrombosis. The Crash-2 trial (Clinical Randomization of an Antifibrinolytic in Significant Hemorrhage) examined use of tranexamic acid in bleeding trauma patients within eight hours after injury. It enrolled 20 211 patients from 274 hospitals in 40 countries. Early treatment (within three hours of injury) with tranexamic acid significantly reduced deaths from bleeding and all-cause mortality, but late administration was ineffective and there were more deaths from bleeding, although no increase in all-cause mortality.

Patients in the late phase of trauma can develop prothrombotic intravascular coagulation, driven by damage associated molecular pattern molecules (DAMPs), and tranexamic acid is contraindicated in this period. Disseminated intravascular coagulation is characterised by microvascular fibrin formation with consumption of coagulation proteins leading to their exhaustion and consequent bleeding. For this reason, the balance of benefits and harms of tranexamic acid in patients at risk of microvascular thrombosis, such as patients with multiple trauma having orthopaedic surgery more than three hours after injury, remains uncertain.

Because there is strong evidence that tranexamic acid reduces bleeding and transfusion and no indication of any increased risk of thrombosis, the benefits exceed the harms in patients having major surgery. Even in patients who do not require transfusion, reducing bleeding will reduce postoperative anaemia and facilitate more rapid recovery. Postoperative anaemia is associated with an increased risk of infection, longer hospital stays, heart failure, and death. Research is needed to evaluate the effects of tranexamic acid on patient centred outcomes such as postoperative pain and mobility, patient satisfaction, and time to discharge and resumption of normal activities.

### Use of topical tranexamic acid or aminocaproic acid to prevent bleeding after major surgical procedures [^84f3a5bf]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the literature describing topical use of tranexamic acid or aminocaproic acid for prevention of postoperative bleeding after major surgical procedures.

Data Sources

Literature was retrieved through MEDLINE (1946-September 2011) and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1970-September 2011) using the terms tranexamic acid, aminocaproic acid, antifibrinolytic, topical, and surgical. In addition, reference citations from publications identified were reviewed.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All identified articles in English were evaluated. Clinical trials, case reports, and meta-analyses describing topical use of tranexamic acid or aminocaproic acid to prevent postoperative bleeding were included.

Data Synthesis

A total of 16 publications in the setting of major surgical procedures were included; the majority of data were for tranexamic acid. For cardiac surgery, 4 trials used solutions containing tranexamic acid (1–2.5 g in 100–250 mL of 0.9% NaCl), and 1 trial assessed a solution containing aminocaproic acid (24 g in 250 mL of 0.9% NaCl). These solutions were poured into the chest cavity before sternotomy closure. For orthopedic procedures, all of the data were for topical irrigation solutions containing tranexamic acid (500 mg-3 g in 50–100 mL of 0.9% NaCl) or for intraarticular injections of tranexamic acid (250 mg to 2 g in 20–50 mL of 0.9% sodium chloride, with or without carbazochrome sodium sulfate). Overall, use of topical tranexamic acid or aminocaproic acid reduced postoperative blood loss; however, few studies reported a significant reduction in the number of packed red blood cell transfusions or units given, intensive care unit stay, or length of hospitalization.

Conclusions

Topical application of tranexamic acid and aminocaproic acid to decrease postsurgical bleeding after major surgical procedures is a promising strategy. Further data are needed regarding the safety of this hemostatic approach.

Tranexamic acid

Tranexamic acid is a synthetic derivative of the amino acid lysine that inhibits plasminogen activation, thus inhibiting fibrinolysis. It has been proven to reduce bleeding in most surgical settings including cardiac and major non‐cardiac surgery, major trauma and postpartum haemorrhage. A meta‐analysis of 216 trials (125,550 participants) across a range of clinical settings found no evidence of an increased risk of thromboembolic complications associated with the use of tranexamic acid, supporting the general safety of the drug. More recently, another meta‐analysis focusing on patients undergoing non‐cardiac surgery (191 RCTs, 40,621 participants) also found no evidence of an increased risk of cardiovascular thromboembolic complications, seizures or mortality at 30 days with tranexamic acid use. A suggested dosing schedule for different clinical indications is provided in Table 4. It should be used with caution in patients with massive haematuria (if risk of ureteric obstruction) and in patients on oral contraceptive pills (risk of thrombosis) and is contraindicated in disseminated intravascular coagulation.

Aprotinin

Aprotinin is a serine protease inhibitor which has been widely used in cardiac surgery as an antifibrinolytic agent to minimise patient bleeding. It was withdrawn from the European market in 2008 for safety reasons but was reintroduced in 2012 with narrow licencing indications, specifically isolated coronary artery bypass graft surgery in high‐risk patients. However, in clinical practice, its predominant use appears to be outside its licence, mainly being used in patients likely to bleed during major cardiac surgery such as acute aortic dissection and surgery in patients with infective endocarditis. This is supported by observational data where aprotinin was associated with a lower incidence of massive bleeding and reduced mortality in high‐risk cardiac surgery, but not in low to moderate‐risk patients.

### Safety and efficacy of local tranexamic acid for the prevention of surgical bleeding in soft-tissue surgery: a review of the literature and recommendations for plastic surgery [^b8e9a794]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Tranexamic acid is a synthetic analogue of lysine that blocks the lysine binding site on plasminogen, thus preventing the activation of plasminogen to plasmin (Fig. 1, below, right). Tranexamic acid can also block urokinase-type plasminogen activator. Tranexamic acid may therefore affect many processes related to surgery and wound healing other than fibrinolysis. The clinical implications of these complex interactions are insufficiently explored.

Lysine analogues can also act as competitive antagonists to inhibitory neurotransmitters acting on glycineand GABA A receptors in the central nervous system and thus cause hyperexcitability. This is a plausible explanation for the increase in seizures observed after high-dose intravenous administration in cardiac surgery. Direct application of tranexamic acid onto the central nervous system after accidental intrathecal injection has led to generalized seizures and even death.

### Effect of tranexamic acid on thrombotic events and seizures in bleeding patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^0055b41e]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Summary of main results

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, intravenous tranexamic acid administration did not appear to increase the risk of thrombotic events and seizures in bleeding patients. In per disease analysis, the risk of thrombotic events and stroke was higher in the TXA group than control in intracranial hemorrhage. With regard to seizures, its risk was increased in cardiac surgery and gastrointestinal hemorrhage, and those increase probably came from higher dose of TXA use. In view of the evidence, tranexamic can be safely used in bleeding patients, especially in trauma, obstetrics and gynecology and orthopedic surgery. There may be a dose-dependent increase in the risk of seizures.

Mechanism of TXA on thrombotic events and seizures

Although theoretically, TXA might be expected to increase the risk of thrombotic events due to its antifibrinolytic activity, the present analysis found no evidence in support of this hypothesis. In the early phase of bleeding in trauma or surgery, early fibrinolysis is triggered by the release of tissue plasminogen activator and causes excessive bleeding. Subsequently, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 level increases and inhibit fibrinolysis. TXA is targeted to modulate early fibrinolysis, and thus it is rational we could not find any increase in thrombotic events in bleeding patients with hyperfibrinolysis even for TXA use.

TXA-associated seizures are caused by another mechanism. TXA is a competitive antagonist of GABA A in brain. In in vitro and animal experiment, higher TXA level in the cerebral spinal fluid, correlated with serum concentration, was associated with the incidence of seizures. In fact, the results of this meta-analysis were consistent with the basic research reporting dose-dependent increase in the risk of seizures.

Strength of the review

A major strength of this analysis is that the present meta-analysis included recently published all the available large-scale randomized controlled trials. Pooling data from 102,681 patients enrolled in 234 randomized controlled trials of tranexamic acid, our study included by far more information than any previous meta-analysis that have addressed this issue. Therefore, this meta-analysis would provide greater evidence regarding safety of tranexamic acid in bleeding populations. In fact, the certainty of evidence evaluated by the GRADE approach was high in thrombotic events with narrow confidence intervals.

### Safety and efficacy of local tranexamic acid for the prevention of surgical bleeding in soft-tissue surgery: a review of the literature and recommendations for plastic surgery [^af0c9428]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Although most plastic surgical procedures are not associated with major blood loss, bleeding causes swelling, bruising and pain, need for drains and bandage changes, and reoperations, and may increase the risk of infection and wound ruptures. Keeping surgical bleeding to a minimum is, thus, beneficial for both patient and provider. Fear of bleeding may also prevent plastic surgeons from using adequate thromboprophylactic measures as addressed by the American Society of Plastic Surgeons Venous Thromboembolism Prevention Task Force.

In surgery, a balance between coagulation and fibrinolysis is needed to prevent bleeding yet maintain circulation. If fibrinolysis exceeds coagulation, bleeding may occur despite adequately performed hemostasis. While meticulous surgical technique, use of cautery, and local infiltration of wound edges with adrenaline can largely control bleeding in soft-tissue surgery, bony tissue cannot be infiltrated or manipulated to the same extent. Measures such as hypotensive anesthesia and pharmacological aids are, therefore, used to control bleeding in bony tissue.

Antifibrinolytic drugs have been the only available pharmacological means of a general reduction of bleeding with an acceptable safety profile in patients without coagulation deficiencies. Tranexamic acid is a synthetic low-cost antifibrinolytic drug manufactured and approved for intravenous and oral use, and systemic prophylactic use reduces both bleeding volume and transfusion needs by 30 to 40 percent. Although large studies have found little evidence of a prothrombotic effect from tranexamic acid, – contradictory studies do exist. – Moreover, a dose-dependent increase in seizures has been documented from intravenous use of tranexamic acid in cardiac surgery. Fear of possible adverse effects has, therefore, limited routine systemic use to surgery with expected high-volume bleeding and frequent need of blood transfusions; this includes mostly surgery affecting skeletal structures, such as joint arthroplasties, craniomaxillofacial surgery, and cardiac surgery, with its associated thoracotomy, use of cardiopulmonary bypass, and high-dose anticoagulation. Use in burns, is not established, probably because of uncertainties regarding adverse effects of tranexamic acid during ongoing hyperfibrinolysis.

EFFECT OF LOCAL TRANEXAMIC ACID IN SOFT-TISSUE SURGERY

Literature Search Strategy and Study Selection

With assistance from a Medical Research Librarian, we searched Medline, PubMed, Embase, The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, The Web of Science Core Collection, Google Scholar, andfrom inception through March 20, 2020, for studies comparing the effect of local administration of tranexamic acid in surgery to either placebo or standard of care. The full electronic search strategy is provided in the Appendix. (See Appendix, Supplemental Digital Content 1, which shows the search strategy systematic review from March 20, 2020,.) Search result and selection process are presented in Figure 2. Two authors (K. A. and R.F.) independently reviewed the retrieved results using the following inclusion criteria: (1) study population receiving local use of tranexamic acid in connection with a surgical procedure, (2) human studies, and (3) abstract or full-text article published. Orthopedic or cardiac studies and minor procedures, such as dental extractions or biopsies, were excluded. A full-text review of remaining publications was performed, and reference lists of relevant publications were screened. Randomized controlled trials were identified for final analyses for the systematic review. Other studies were included for the narrative review.

Search results

We identified 4541 results according to the search strategy described above. The detailed search process was provided in Additional file 1. After assessing 103 full-text articles for eligibility, 49 of them were finally included in the meta-analysis (Fig. 1). Major exclusions were provided in Additional file 2.

PRISMA diagram showing article selection for the review

Included studies

We included 49 studies with a total of 10,591 participants in this meta-analysis. The detailed characteristics of all included studies were listed in Additional file 3 One thing worth noticing was that intravenous drug administration varied significantly between trials on dosage regimen. There were mainly two types of intravenous administration methods. One was bolus infusion alone (14 trials) and the other was bolus injection followed by continuous infusion (22 trials). Since these two delivery methods varied significantly in pharmacokinetics, we decided the cutoff value for high and low dose TXA separately. According to what's mentioned in the background, we defined < 50 mg/kg of TXA as low dose for bolus injection, and ≤ 10 mg/kg + 1 mg/kg/h TXA as low dose for bolus plus continuous infusion.

Risk of bias in included studies

Details regarding the performance of the studies against each domain were presented in the Risk of bias graph (Fig. 2). Additionally, a visual summary of judgement s about each methodological quality item for each included trial was shown in Fig. 3.

Risk of bias summary

Most of the trials included had low risk of bias on random sequence generation, blinding, incomplete outcome data and selective reporting. Selective reporting turned out to be the main risk of bias in this meta-analysis. We rated 33 trials as having low risk of selective reporting, 11 trials as having high risk of selective reporting and 5 trial as having unclear risk of selective reporting. Typical bias for selective reporting was that some studies failed to report transfusion rate while only reporting transfusion volume or vice versa. There was a risk that insignificant data were concealed, and results were thus misrepresented. Also, many of the trials failed to report information on allocation concealment and were rated to be have unclear risk of bias for this item. In summary, there were 13 trials with high risk of bias, 13 trials with low risk of bias and 23 studies with unclear risk of bias.

### Prophylactic intraoperative tranexamic acid administration and postoperative blood loss after transapical aortic valve implantation [^74f6e98a]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Tranexamic acid has been shown to be effective in reducing blood loss in surgery, particularly cardiac surgery. Due to its hemostatic properties and miniscule costs, tranexamic acid is routinely administered in all patients undergoing cardiac surgery with and without CPB. However, there is no clear consensus regarding the optimal dosage of tranexamic acid (dosages between 1 g and > 10 g or 10–100 mg/kg described in the post-aprotinin era). Recently, a dose–response relationship between tranexamic acid (TA) dose and seizure has been observed in cardiac surgery patients. Increased incidence of postoperative generalized seizures have been shown to be associated with high-dose administration of TXA (≥ 100 mg/kg). Our low-dose administration of tranexamic acid (1 g as a bolus dose before skin incision followed by a continuous infusion of 400 mg/h until the end of surgery) is much lower compared to other described dosing regimens, but it has been proven effective in a large series of patient.

Limitations

There are certain limitations to this study. The results of this study were obtained from a database with prospectively collected data. However, this is a post hoc non-pre-specified analysis and we cannot rule out the possibility that other potential confounding variables not included in the study might have affected the results. Furthermore, our findings are based on a very small sample size (especially with regard to the possibilities of statistical analysis) and clinical events from a single site. However, this is a homogeneous, well comparable patient group.

One main shortcoming of the present study is that we did not have data regarding the peri-procedural D-dimer and fibrinogen plasma concentrations. Therefore, these shortcomings -due to the retrospective study design with the chance that other potential risk factors have not been included- limit the conclusions that can be drawn. Therefore, a larger prospective randomized trial is needed to overcome these shortcomings.

### The impact of administration of tranexamic acid in reducing the use of red blood cells and other blood products in cardiac surgery [^65b93020]. BMC Anesthesiology (2006). Low credibility.

While this observational study lacks characteristics inherent to a well conducted randomised, double blinded, placebo controlled trial, it adds to the wealth of knowledge already available by studying the effect of a therapy in a large group of patients subjected to a normal clinical pathway. We used multivariate logistic regression in order to minimise a selection bias on treatment allocation. Our large sample size means that the statistical tests have good power. However, for the same reason, these tests can detect very small differences as statistically significant, such as showing that patients receiving tranexamic acid were older, had a higher EuroSCORE and had longer bypass times, but these differences were not clinically significant. Other statistically significant differences were observed in relation to postoperative blood loss, but some of the highly significant differences were small due to the large sample size (i.e. the median blood loss for patients receiving clopidogrel was 500 mL compared with 450 mL for those patients not receiving clopidogrel). In the absence of randomisation, a subjective effect cannot entirely be discarded by which physicians may be unconsciously biased towards administering less transfusion to those patients having received tranexamic acid. However, we believe that this is unlikely to have tainted our primary end-points as (1) adherence to the institutional protocol was similar for both patients receiving or not tranexamic acid (In the TA group 1207 (78%) of transfused patients were transfused according to guidelines compared with 319 (75%) in the NTA group, the difference is non-significant (p = 0.124, Chi-squared test)); (2) a significant difference in the amount of blood loss measured in those patients treated with tranexamic acid when compared with those who were not; (3) the fact that the size of the institution and clinical pathways usually prevent clinicians prescribing postoperative transfusion and involved in the decision to take back to be aware if the administration of tranexamic acid effectively took place (as all patients should have received it).

We did not investigate the mortality and morbidity following the use of tranexamic acid, neither graft patency nor the incidence of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism as data are not available in that regard.

This study does not suggest that tranexamic acid is a safer alternative to other antifibribolytic, neither does it address the possibility that it may affect morbidity as recently reported with aprotinin.

### Safety and effectiveness of two treatment regimes with tranexamic acid to minimize inflammatory response in elective cardiopulmonary bypass patients: a randomized double-blind, dose-dependent, phase IV clinical trial [^57e9a1ac]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Seizure was present in 2 (1.3%) and stroke in 3 (1.9%) patients. Acute kidney injury occurred in 14 (8.8%) patients, and 7(4.4%) needed dialysis. Finally, 3 (1.9%) suffered myocardial infarction. Seven patients required re-operation for bleeding: 5 in TA1 and 2 in TA2,(P = 0.44). There were 9 deaths, without significant differences between groups: 3 (3.8%) in TA1 versus 6 (7.6%) in TA2 (P = 0.29). Statistically, there were no significant differences in expected vs. observed mortality between the two groups. According to logistic Euroscore, the rates of mortality were: TA1-observed = 3.8% (3/80) and TA1-expected = 3.25% (3/80), (P = 0.99) and TA2-observed = 7.6% (6/80)] and TA2-expected = 3.27% (3/80), (P = 0.11). There were no significant differences between groups in cerebrovascular events, renal pathology, myocardial infarction, mechanical ventilation or ICU stay after surgery, nor when comparing composite adverse effects (Table 2).

### Tranexamic acid for safer surgery: the time is now [^bd2e1695]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2022). Medium credibility.

Tranexamic acid reduces surgical bleeding. Consistent with previous research, the POISE-3 (Peri-Operative Ischemic Evaluation-3) trial found that tranexamic acid reduces major bleeding by 25% and with a low probability of any increase in thromboembolic events. Wider tranexamic acid use will improve surgical safety, avoid unnecessary blood use, reduce the risk of transfusion transmitted infections, and save healthcare funds. 'Consideration of tranexamic acid use' should be included in the safe surgery checklist. We have the evidence, and we need to act on it.

### Tranexamic acid-associated seizures: causes and treatment [^00dfdb91]. Annals of Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Antifibrinolytic drugs are used worldwide to decrease the requirement for blood transfusions, reduce the risk of reoperation for bleeding, and lower mortality associated with hemorrhage following major trauma. 1, 2, 3 The most commonly used antifibrinolytic drugs include tranexamic acid (TXA), ɛ‐aminocaproic acid (EACA), and aprotinin. 1 TXA and EACA are synthetic derivatives of the amino acid lysine that exert their hemostatic effects by binding to plasminogen. 4, 5, 6 This binding prevents the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin and reduces the degradation of fibrin‐containing blood clots. 4, 5, 6 Aprotinin, conversely, is a serine protease inhibitor that binds directly to plasmin and inhibits its function. 7

Antifibrinolytic agents are considered to be safe and affordable drugs with few serious adverse effects. 1 However, observational clinical trials and case reports have shown that TXA, and to a lesser extent EACA, but not aprotinin, are associated with seizures. 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34 Most TXA‐associated seizures occur in patients who have undergone cardiac procedures. 16, 17, 18, 20, 21, 24, 25, 26, 30, 31, 32, 34 However, several case reports indicate that TXA‐associated seizures also occur in nonsurgical patients. 10, 22, 27 Seizures in postoperative cardiac surgery patients have been reported to be associated with a 2‐fold increase in hospital length of stay and a 2.5‐fold higher mortality rate. 26 An increase in the incidence of delirium and stroke, and a reduced quality of life have also been reported. 35

### The safety and efficiency of intravenous administration of tranexamic acid in coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG): a meta-analysis of 28 randomized controlled trials [^b526d1fb]. BMC Anesthesiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this meta-analysis, we found that the intravenous use of TXA was associated with lower risk of reoperation for postoperative bleeding, blood loss and blood transfusion than the placebo group. Moreover, we also found that intravenous use of TXA did not increase the risk of postoperative cerebrovascular accident, mortality or other thrombotic complication among patients undergoing CABG when compared with placebo treatment. However, it may increase the incidence of postoperative seizures. The results of most subgroup analyses of the primary results in CABG conducted under on-pump or off-pump condition were consistent with that of overall analyses. However, meta-analysis could not be performed in the sub-analyses of postoperative reoperation for bleeding, mortality and cerebrovascular accident in off-pump CABG due to the small number of incidence. No significant decrease in postoperative reoperation for bleeding and transfusion of any blood products were found in on-pump group. Most of the sensitivity analyses in trails that recruited more than 99 participants or in trails that excluded the study with the largest number of participants further strengthened the conclusion of overall analyses.

The release of plasmin during cardiac surgery activates fibrinolysis and may contribute to platelet dysfunction. In addition to inhibiting the transformation of plasminogen into plasmin by reversibly binding lysine binding site on plasmin, TXA can also reduce bleeding by preventing platelet activation induced by fibrinolytic enzyme. A previous meta-analysis suggested that TXA was effective in reducing blood loss and the need for blood transfusion in cardiac surgery. However, the incidence of reoperation for bleeding was not significantly decrease by TXA. In our current analysis, we found that TXA overall reduced the transfusion of any blood products and 24-h postoperative chest tube drainage in CABG surgery which was consistent with the previous study. Moreover, the sub-analyses in the different conditions under which GABG was conducted further strengthened the above results. However, these analyses have significant heterogeneity which may due to the difference in indications of blood transfusion, drug dose and treatment regimens among different studies.

### Drugs to reduce bleeding and transfusion in major open vascular or endovascular surgery: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^9d0170d0]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Tranexamic acid (TXA)

TXA is a synthetic analogue of the amino acid lysine. It binds reversibly to lysine receptor sites on plasminogen, prevents activation of plasminogen into plasmin, and reduces fibrin breakdown. This improves clot formation, stability and duration. TXA has been well validated for use in perioperative, obstetric and trauma care, as well as in cardiac surgery (Henry 2011; Ker 2015; Shakur 2018). A systematic review and network meta‐analysis of antifibrinolytic adverse drugs effects in the setting of cardiac surgery suggests TXA use reduces mortality compared to placebo or aprotinin. In addition, it does not increase myocardial infarction (MI), cerebrovascular attack (CVA) or renal failure or dysfunction (Hutton 2012). In high doses, however, TXA has been associated with seizures in the cardiac surgery setting (Murkin 2010).

ε‐aminocaproic acid (EACA)

EACA is another synthetic lysine analogue, with a similar mechanism of action to tranexamic acid. Comparative potency of EACA and TXA estimates vary but suggest EACA is 7 to 10 times less potent than tranexamic acid (Thomsen 2006). There is no known association with seizures.

Antifibrinolytic drugs such as EACA and TXA are usually administered intravenously after induction of anaesthesia. Usually, a loading dose is given followed by continuous infusion. High doses appear to be more effective than low doses (Henry 2011). Neither TXA nor EACA has been associated with increased risks of adverse effects (Hutton 2012).

### The safety and efficiency of intravenous administration of tranexamic acid in coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG): a meta-analysis of 28 randomized controlled trials [^3a656cf3]. BMC Anesthesiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Excessive bleeding is a common complication which may lead to exposure to the risk of homologous blood transfusion and increased morbidity in patients undergoing cardiac operations. Tranexamic acid (TXA), an antifibrinolytic agent, has been widely used and proved to be effective in reducing risk of blood loss and transfusion among patients undergoing cardiac surgery. However, whether it reduced the incidence of reoperation for life-threatening bleeding which are strongly associated with poor outcomes after cardiac surgery remains controversial.

Despite of the effectiveness in reducing the risk of blood loss and transfusion, it may potentially increase the risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, and other thrombotic complications after cardiac surgery especially in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery who are commonly characterized by systemic arteriosclerosis or stenosis. It was reported that TXA was associated with the increased risk of postoperative neurologic events such as stroke and seizures in cardiac surgery. Some studies have suggested that TXA is associated with reduction in cerebral blood flow and increase the risk of cerebral infarction. A multi-center study suggested that TXA was associated with a higher risk of postoperative seizures in GABG surgery. A meta-analysis in 2011 has shown that TXA is associated with reduced blood transfusion in off-pump CABG surgery. However, the safety of TXA in off-pump CABG surgery could not be confirmed due to the small population sample size.

An increasing number of studies that investigated the effectiveness and safety of TXA in CABG surgery have been conducted in recent years with varying results. Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis of existing studies to estimate the safety and efficiency of TXA in CABG surgery focusing on the incidence of postoperative cerebrovascular accident, seizures and reoperation for bleeding.

### Tranexamic acid-associated seizures: causes and treatment [^dd10cbfb]. Annals of Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Retrospective studies have identified several risk factors for TXA‐associated seizures. These include higher doses of TXA, such as those recommended in the BART study (Blood conservation using Antifibrinolytics in a Randomized Trial; ∼80–100mg/kg total dose). 16, 20, 26, 43 Female gender, increased age, and poor overall health also predispose patients to seizures. 16, 17, 20, 26 Seizures are observed more frequently in patients older than 70 years, and those with a high disease severity score, as measured by an APACHE II index (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II) > 20. 16, 20 Patients with renal dysfunction or prior neurological and cardiovascular disorders are also at increased risk. 16, 17, 20, 26 Other important risk factors for TXA‐associated seizures include the type and duration of surgery. Most seizures are reported in patients undergoing "open chamber surgery" (eg, aortic valve replacement). 16, 17, 18, 20 The risk is also increased in patients with deep hypothermic circulatory arrest, long cardiopulmonary bypass time, or prolonged aortic cross‐clamp time. 16, 18, 20, 26

Several case reports indicate that seizures are not restricted to cardiac surgery patients. For example, a patient with chronic kidney failure who was treated with TXA experienced a convulsive seizure. 10 Another patient who underwent a craniotomy for meningioma had tonic–clonic convulsions after the administration of TXA. 22 A third patient who was admitted for hemoptysis had a focal seizure after TXA treatment, which progressed to a generalized seizure. 27 None of these patients had a history of seizure disorders and no abnormalities were detected on subsequent electroencephalography (EEG) or computed tomographic scans. 10, 22, 27 Collectively, these case studies indicate that a wide range of patients may be vulnerable to TXA‐associated seizures. Increasing global "off‐label" use of TXA may further increase the incidence of TXA‐associated seizures.

2022. 20277. To the Editor A recent study1 demonstrated a modest but statistically significant reduction in the number of patients needing red blood cell transfusion with use of high-dose vs low-dose tranexamic acid. In cardiac surgery, it is known that the benefits of tranexamic acid are counterbalanced by an increased risk of seizures, 2 likely due to cardiopulmonary bypass–associated disturbance of the blood-brain barrier and a disinhibition of cerebral γ-aminobutyric acid receptors. 3 Although the risk of. seizure was increased in the high-dose tranexamic acid group in this study by Dr Shi and colleagues, 1 the observed incidence of seizures in both groups was lower than the 2. 7% rate reported in a meta-analysis of studies of tranexamic acid use in cardiac. surgery.

2 Large studies have found a higher risk of seizures associated with open-chamber surgery, higher tranexamic acid dose, older age, and impaired kidney function. 2–5 Moreover, seizures are associated with increased early mortality. 4, 5 Although nearly 85% of patients underwent open-chamber surgery in this study, 1 the mean age of patients in both groups was only 53 years. In addition, age greater than 70 years was an exclusion criterion for study participation, which prevents application of the study results to elderly high-risk patients, who are a large and increasing patient population in contemporary cardiac surgery.

### Patient blood management interventions do not lead to important clinical benefits or cost-effectiveness for major surgery: a network meta-analysis [^596c14ab]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2021). Medium credibility.

PBM interventions may reduce secondary care costs, but this has not been shown to equate to cost-effectiveness. This is explained by two observations. First, the reductions in transfusion costs with PBM interventions are small; the mean reduction in red cell transfusion in this review was 0.83 units per patient. In the UK, a single unit of red cells costs £190. In contrast, administration of intravenous iron costs approximately £79.7 per patient, consumables for point-of-care tests range from £43 to £79 per patient, and cell salvage consumables cost approximately £300. Second, no analysis demonstrated clinical effectiveness.

The results of this study suggest that the adoption of restrictive transfusion thresholds in surgery patients is reasonable as this has a direct and significant cost reduction in the absence of harm. Tranexamic acid also undoubtedly has a role in clinical care. The reductions in mortality in this analysis were not statistically significant. The point treatment effect estimate (RR = 0.83) was also less than that observed in a previous review(RR = 0.61), but included an additional 220 trials of tranexamic acid in 26 399 participants. However, it is inexpensive, costing £7–15 per patient, and reduces reoperation for bleeding, and perhaps resource use. In settings where coagulative haemorrhage is common such as liver, cardiac, and transplant surgery, these are undoubted benefits. A research question identified by this study is whether there is any added benefit from the use of PBM interventions beyond restrictive transfusion thresholds and tranexamic acid use.

The study HeLiX was published by Paul J Karanicolas and colleagues in 2024 in the journal JAMA. This study is related to the following diseases: Hepatocellular carcinoma, Cholangiocarcinoma, Liver metastasis, Perioperative bleeding and Red blood cell transfusion. In the HeLiX study, the trial question was: what is the role of tranexamic acid in patients undergoing liver resection for a cancer-related indication? In the HeLiX study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the HeLiX study, the population was: 1245 patients (495 female, 750 male). The inclusion criteria were patients undergoing liver resection for a cancer-related indication. The key exclusion criteria were severe anemia, arterial or venous thrombosis within the prior 3 months; active treatment with anticoagulants; DIC; CrCl < 30 mL/min; history of seizure disorder; inability to receive blood products. In the HeLiX study, the interventions were: n = 619 tranexamic acid (1 g bolus followed by 1 g infusion over 8 hours starting at anesthesia induction) n = 626 placebo (normal saline 1 g bolus followed by 1 g infusion over 8 hours starting at anesthesia induction). In the HeLiX study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in the rate of RBC transfusion within 7 days of surgery (16.3% vs. 14.5%; OR 1.15, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.56). In the HeLiX study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in intraoperative RBC transfusion (9.2% vs. 10.2%; OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.3) No significant difference in postoperative RBC transfusion (9.9% vs. 7.7%; OR 1.32, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.96) No significant difference in mean intraoperative blood loss (817.3 mL vs. 836.7 mL; AD -19.4 mL, 95% CI -137.5 to 98.8). In the HeLiX study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in VTE and death. significant differences in surgical complications (43.8% vs. 37.9%), major complications (16.8% vs. 12.5%). In the HeLiX study, the conclusion was: in patients undergoing liver resection for a cancer-related indication, tranexamic acid was not superior to placebo with respect to the rate of RBC transfusion within 7 days of surgery.

This study is related to the following diseases: Perioperative bleeding and Perioperative cardiac risk management for noncardiac surgery. In the POISE-3 (original research) study, the trial question was: what is the role of tranexamic acid in patients undergoing noncardiac surgery? In the POISE-3 (original research) study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the POISE-3 (original research) study, the population was: 9535 patients (4185 female, 5350 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients undergoing noncardiac surgery. The key exclusion criteria were patients undergoing cardiac surgery or cranial neurosurgery; use of systemic tranexamic acid during surgery; CrCl < 30 mL/min; receipt of long-term dialysis. In the POISE-3 (original research) study, the interventions were: n = 4757 tranexamic acid (prophylactic 1 g intravenous bolus of tranexamic acid given at the start and end of surgery) n = 4778 placebo (1 g 0.9% normal saline at the start and end of surgery). In the POISE-3 (original research) study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in composite outcome of life-threatening bleeding, major bleeding, or bleeding into a critical organ at 30 days (9.1% vs. 11.7%; HR 0.76, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.87). In the POISE-3 (original research) study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in life-threatening bleeding at 30 days (1.6% vs. 1.7%; HR 0.99, 99% CI 0.73 to 1.36) Significant decrease in major bleeding at 30 days (7.6% vs. 10.4%; HR 0.72, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.83) No significant difference in critical organ bleeding at 30 days (0.3% vs. 0.4%; HR 0.57, 95% CI 0.28 to 1.16). In the POISE-3 (original research) study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in cardiovascular outcome event at 30 days. In the POISE-3 (original research) study, the conclusion was: in adult patients undergoing noncardiac surgery, tranexamic acid was superior to placebo with respect to the composite outcome of life-threatening bleeding, major bleeding, or bleeding into a critical organ at 30 days.

### Strategies to prevent blood loss and reduce transfusion in emergency general surgery, WSES-AAST consensus paper [^98d4bac9]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Tranexamic acid

In emergency surgery settings, meta-analysis and RCTs indicate that tranexamic (TXA) acid for prophylaxis of excessive bleeding administered before and/or during a procedure is effective in reducing perioperative blood loss by approximately one-third, the number of patients transfused, and the volume of transfused blood products. Most RCTs comparing TXA with placebo or no TXA controls report no differences for stroke, myocardial infarction, renal failure, reoperation for bleeding, or mortality. However, there are RCT studies reporting increased thrombotic risk and observational studies suggesting adverse outcomes.

What remains unclear is the optimal route, dose, and timing of TXA administration. Protocols in studies to date are extremely heterogeneous and its administration can be via intravenous, intra-articular, oral routes or in combination. Doses may also be weight-adjusted and can also range from 10 to 20 mg/kg. Administration can also be repeated during the intraoperative and postoperative phases. Some studies even suggest topical TXA delivery to overcome contraindications such as renal disease owing to lower plasma levels.

ε-Aminocaproic acid [and Aprotinin]

Meta-analysis of placebo-controlled RCTs indicate that the use of ε-aminocaproic acid, which similar to TXA inhibits plasminogen binding to fibrin, administered before and/or during a procedure is effective in reducing total perioperative blood loss and the number of patients transfused in major elective cardiac, orthopaedic, or liver surgery; equivocal findings are reported for the volume of blood transfused. No data exist about its use in emergency surgery settings. However, some data suggest that Aprotinin, which inhibits plasmin directly, may be associated with increased postoperative mortality rates.

Perioperative bleeding induced by cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) is a major complication of cardiac surgery. Various factors contribute to CPB-induced coagulation dysfunction, and hyperactivation of fibrinolysis is one of the important causes. Aminocaprioc acid is the most commonly used antifibrinolytic agent in north America and its use recommendation is class Ia. Tranexamic acid (TXA) is used most commonly in Asia due to its cost, wide availability and heat stability despite having slightly lower safety profile than aminocaproid acid. The blood saving efficacy of TXA in cardiac surgery has been proved in several studies, but the TXA dosing regimens vary in those studies.

The most commonly used TXA dosing regimens are the low-dose regimen reported by Horrow et al and higher-dose regimen described by Dowd et al. Horrow et al. proposed a small-dose dosing regimen according to one early pharmacokinetic study that confirmed TXA concentrations of 10 μg/ml could provide effective inhibition of fibrinolysis. On the other hand, Dowd et al. believed that TXA concentrations should be greater than 126 μg/ml to achieve 100% inhibition of fibrinolysis, and they proposed a high-dose dosing regimen. A recent systematic review concluded that TXA concentrations of 10–15 mg/l could lead to a substantial inhibition fibrinolysis, but of the 21 included studies, 20 were in vitro and only one was in vivo. This vivo study only enrolled children undergoing cardiac surgery with either continuous or discontinuous TXA schemes. The dose of TXA is potentially important because TXA also dose-dependently increases seizure risk.

A randomized, controlled, prospective trial showed that TXA suppressed fibrinolysis by inhibiting tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and plasmin activity, however, TXA did not affect other important fibrinolytic inhibitors, such as plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) and α 2 -antiplasmin. According to the results of an in-vitro study, TXA significantly reduces the clot lysis index (CLI) through tPA-induced hyperfibrinolysis in human whole blood, as analyzed using rotational thromboelastography (TEG).

TXA dosing regimens vary in adults undergoing cardiac surgery, but the in-vivo effect of two tranexamic acid doses on fibrinolysis parameters has not been systematically elucidated. Therefore we performed this feasibility pilot study to investigate if the in-vivo effect of low dose TXA is equivalent to high dose TXA on fibrinolysis parameters by measurement of fibrinolysis markers in adults undergoing valvular cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass.

### The safety and efficiency of intravenous administration of tranexamic acid in coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG): a meta-analysis of 28 randomized controlled trials [^4e8288c7]. BMC Anesthesiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Methods

The meta-analysis was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement in this study.

Search strategy

A systematic and comprehensive search was conducted in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), PUBMED and EMBASE from database established to February 8, 2018 with no language limitation. The search strategy included the following MEDLINE subject heading terms: tranexamic acid and cardiac surgical procedures. The above subject heading terms were connected by "AND". The initial searches of PUBMED and EMBASE were unrestricted to maximize sensitivity and a filter which primarily identifies randomized controlled trials was adopted to improve the specificity. Moreover, we also checked the reference lists of relevant articles for potential relevant studies.

Eligibility criteria

Randomized controlled trials that compared the effectiveness or safety of the intravenous administration of TXA with that of placebo in adult CABG surgery were included in this meta-analysis. Studies were eligible for inclusion, regardless of the publication language. We excluded studies which were conducted on underage patients or in which TXA was topically applied in mediastinum.

Selection of included studies

Retrieved studies were imported into Endnote (version X7; Thomson Reuters), where duplications were detected and deleted automatically. Two authors independently scanned the titles and abstract of retrieved studies according to the established eligibility criteria to exclude the obvious unrelated studies. The full-text was further evaluated if the judgement could not easily be decided based on its title or abstract. The disagreements between reviewers were settled by a third reviewer. The relevant data of included studies was extracted by these reviewers independently using a standard data sheet. Study characteristics included author, publication year, sample size, sex ratio, type of CABG, duration of anticoagulant medication discontinued before surgery, outcome data, drug dose and treatment regimens.

Assessment of risk of bias in included studies

The Cochrane risk of bias tool which is recommended by the Cochrane Collaboration for risk of bias assessment was adopted in this study. There are seven domains in the Cochrane risk of bias tool, including the random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of participants and personnel, blinding of outcome assessment, incomplete outcome data, selective reporting and other bias. The judgment of each domain is presented as "low risk", "high risk" or "unclear risk" based on the instruction of Cochrane Collaboration. Two reviewers independently assessed each domain of included studies and any disagreements were adjudicated by a third reviewer.

### Tranexamic acid in total joint arthroplasty: the endorsed clinical practice guides of the American Association of Hip and Knee Surgeons, American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine, American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, hip society, and knee society [^92bffef4]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Total hip arthroplasty (THA) TXA routes and dose categories — comparative findings: Intravenous and topical TXA compared in multiple randomized clinical trials showed no difference in the risk of transfusion. Network meta-analyses compared low-dose intravenous (< 20 mg/kg or ≤ 1 g), high-dose intravenous (≥ 20 mg/kg or > 1 g), low-dose topical (≤ 1.5 g), high-dose topical (> 1.5 g), oral, and combined intravenous/topical TXA, and no method provided a significantly different outcome for reducing blood loss. For transfusion risk, combined intravenous/topical TXA was equivalent to oral TXA but superior to low-dose intravenous, high-dose intravenous, low-dose topical and high-dose topical TXA; however, this inconsistent result likely reflects bias from a limited number of studies and not superiority.

### Tranexamic acid-associated seizures: causes and treatment [^8fab4277]. Annals of Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Summary and Outstanding Questions

In summary, TXA‐associated seizures occur most frequently during the early postoperative period after cardiac surgery but also occur in patients undergoing noncardiac surgery and other medical treatments. To reduce the risk of seizures, the lowest effective TXA dose should be considered and dosing should be adjusted for clinical conditions such as renal dysfunction. A high index of suspicion is required to detect seizures, and EEG monitoring may be considered for patients who experience myoclonic movements or twitching or show evidence of focal seizures. Based on results from preclinical studies, general anesthetics including propofol and isoflurane may be considered as the first line for prevention and/or treatment. In high‐risk patients, terminating the TXA infusion early and/or prolonging the administration of anesthetics may prevent seizures.

Although progress has been made in our understanding of the causes underlying TXA‐associated seizures, many questions remain unanswered. First, it is uncertain why cardiac surgery patients are more vulnerable to TXA‐associated seizures. One potential factor is the high doses of TXA administered during cardiac surgery. 73 Also, cardiac surgery can cause intensive systemic inflammation that increases the permeability of the blood–brain barrier. 74 A jeopardized blood–brain barrier could facilitate the entry of TXA into the CNS. Second, it is important to understand the mechanism by which TXA gains entry into the CNS, as such knowledge could aid in the development of neuroprotective strategies that reduce TXA penetration. Third, it is of interest to know whether TXA dosing should be reduced or avoided in patients with a previous history of a seizure disorder or those with clinical conditions, such as traumatic brain injury, that damage the blood–brain barrier and predispose to seizures. Also, antibiotics such as penicillins and cephalosporins inhibit GABA A receptors and it is unknown whether these drugs exacerbate the proconvulsant properties of TXA.

### Effect of tranexamic acid on surgical bleeding: systematic review and cumulative meta-analysis [^104192b3]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Risk of blood transfusion

Data on blood transfusion were available for 95 trials, including a total of 7838 patients. Tranexamic acid reduced the probability of receiving a blood transfusion by 38% (pooled risk ratio 0.62, 95% confidence interval 0.58 to 0.65; P < 0.001). When the analysis was restricted to the 32 adequately concealed trials involving 3408 patients, tranexamic acid reduced the risk of receiving a blood transfusion by 32% (0.68, 0.62 to 0.74; P < 0.001). When the analysis was restricted to the 69 trials involving 5968 patients with adequate blinding for this outcome, tranexamic acid reduced the risk of blood transfusion by 37% (0.63, 0.59 to 0.68; P < 0.001).

The trials with blood transfusion data involved cardiac (n = 42), orthopaedic (n = 36), cranial and orthognathic (n = 7), gynaecological (n = 5), hepatic (n = 2), urological (n = 2), and vascular (n = 1) surgery. Blood transfusion was statistically significantly reduced in cardiac, orthopaedic, cranial and orthognathic, hepatic, and urological surgery (table 2). The pooled estimates for blood transfusion were consistent with a reduction in the tranexamic acid group among trials in vascular and gynaecological surgery, although the results were imprecise. There was moderate heterogeneity in magnitude of the effects of tranexamic acid by type of surgery, although the direction of the effects was largely consistent.

Thromboembolic events

There was uncertainty about the effect of tranexamic acid on myocardial infarction (risk ratio 0.68, 95% confidence interval 0.43 to 1.09; P = 0.11), stroke (1.14, 0.65 to 2.00; P = 0.65), deep vein thrombosis (0.86, 0.53 to 1.39; P = 0.54), and pulmonary embolism (0.61, 0.25 to 1.47; P = 0.27). The results were similar when the analyses were restricted to trials with adequate allocation concealment and those with blinded outcome assessment.

### Comparative study of tranexamic acid dosing in cardiac… [^2cce4136]. ClinicalTrials (2025). Medium credibility.

Comparative Study of Tranexamic Acid Dosing in Cardiac SurgeryClinicalTrials. gov ID Study Overview Tranexamic axid is routinely used as an antifibrinolytic agent in cardiac surgery to reduce the risk of blood loss and transfusion. However, there is no consensus regarding the dosage regimen of tranexamic acid that should be administered. The purpose of this study is to compare different dosages of tranexamic acid in cardiac surgery using cardiopulmonary bypass regarding the duration of inhibition of fibrinolysis as measured by the ClotPro test. Excessive bleeding and blood transfusions are common in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Antifibrinolytic therapy reduces the risk of blood loss and transfusion among patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Tranexamic acid is an antifibrinolytic agent that forms a reversible complex with plasminogen. Guidelines for the management of bleeding in patients recommend the routine use of tranexamic acid for cardiac surgery in adults.

The present study aims to evaluate different dosages of tranexamic acid in cardiac surgery using cardiopulmonary bypass. The primary outcome is the duration of inhibition of fibrinolysis as measured by the ClotPro test and the correlation of imprinting with tranexamic blood concentration. Methods: Also, the total administration of blood and products, the administration of coagulation factors intraoperatively and during the ICU stay, as well as the total postoperative bleeding in the first 24 hours are recorded. The need for reoperation due to postoperative bleeding, seizures, and all serious adverse events related to surgery and general anesthesian and/or the tranexamic acid administration in the postoperative period are also recorded. The present study aims to evaluate different dosages of tranexamic acid in cardiac surgery using cardiopulmonary bypass. It is a prospective, randomized, comparative study.

The primary outcome is the duration of inhibition of fibrinolysis as measured by the ClotPro test and the correlation of imprinting with tranexamic blood concentration. Secondary outcomes are blood and blood product transfusion, need of coagulation factors administration, postoperative bleeding, time of mechanical ventilation, length of stay in the Intensive Care Unit, total length of hospitalization and all
- cause in hospital mortality. Also, secondary outcomes include the correlation of tranexamic acid dosage with the postoperative incidence of seizures and thrombotic complications.

### Different dose regimes and administration methods of tranexamic acid in cardiac surgery: a meta-analysis of randomized trials [^b17eb1c0]. BMC Anesthesiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Transfusion rate — — high and low dose regimen

For bolus plus continuous infusion, there were 6 trials with low-dose regimen (≤ 10 mg/kg + 1 mg/kg/h) and 12 trials with high-dose regimen. For bolus delivery alone, there were 5 trials with low-dose regimen(< 50 mg/kg) and 4 trials with high-dose regimen.

For bolus plus continuous infusion, in the 6 low-dosage trials with 265 patients, the use of TXA significantly reduce the need for allogeneic blood transfusion by a relative 50% (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.67, P < 0.00001). Heterogeneity between these trials was moderate (Chi 2 = 8.94, df = 5, P = 0.11; I² = 44%). In the 12 high-dosage trials with 2043 patients, the use of TXA significantly reduce the need for allogeneic blood transfusion by a relative 29% (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.71, P < 0.00001). Heterogeneity between trials was moderate (Chi 2 = 13.84, df = 11, P = 0.24; I² = 21%).

For bolus infusion alone, in the 5 low-dosage trials with 496 patients, the use of TXA significantly reduced the need for allogeneic blood transfusion by a relative 39% (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.79, P = 0.0001). Heterogeneity between these trials was low(Chi 2 = 3.40, df = 4, P = 0.49; I² = 0%). In the 4 high-dosage trials with 5212 patients, the use of TXA significantly reduced the need for allogeneic blood transfusion by 31%(RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.74, P < 0.00001). Heterogeneity between these trials was significant (Chi 2 = 10.17, df = 3, P = 0.02; I² = 71%) (Fig. 10).

### Tranexamic acid-associated seizures: causes and treatment [^688e76e7]. Annals of Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

The goal of this review is to increase awareness about seizures associated with antifibrinolytic drugs and provide mechanistic‐based prevention and treatment recommendations. The review focuses on TXA, the most commonly used and widely studied antifibrinolytic drug. First, the incidence, risk factors, and clinical features of TXA‐associated seizures are summarized. Next, preclinical and clinical studies that offer insights into the underlying causes of seizures are reviewed. In particular, a study that measured the concentration of TXA in the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) of patients undergoing major cardiovascular surgery is considered. The study then compared TXA concentrations in the CSF to TXA concentrations that modulate the activity of neurotransmitter receptors in the brain in vitro. Based on these findings, treatment strategies to mitigate TXA‐associated seizures in patients are proposed.

### A retrospective analysis of blood loss with combined topical and intravenous tranexamic acid after coronary artery bypass graft surgery [^04fe0668]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

Intravenous antifibrinolytics are the gold standard for blood conservation during cardiac surgery. Recent evidence suggests that topical tranexamic acid administration also is effective, although the efficacy of combined topical and intravenous administration has never been reported. Combined administration may offer superior hemostasis while decreasing side effects. The current study explores the use of combined topical and intravenous tranexamic acid as a blood conservation strategy in cardiac surgery.

Design

Retrospective cohort.

Setting

A single-center, academic, tertiary care hospital.

Participants

One hundred sixty elective coronary artery bypass graft patients.

Intervention

A practice change allowed a retrospective comparison of postoperative chest tube drainage in patients with intravenous or combined (intravenous and topical) tranexamic acid.

Measurements and Main Results

Chest tube drainage was decreased in the combined group at 3 (164.8 ± 102.2 v 242.7 ± 148.9 mL, p < 0.001), 6 (265.6 ± 163.7 v 358.8 ± 247.2 mL, p = 0.006), and 12 hours (374.3 ± 217.1 v 498.5 ± 336.6 mL, p = 0.006) postoperatively compared with the intravenous group. The tranexamic acid dose was higher in the combined group (5.1 ± 1.1 v 4.1 ± 1.3 g, p < 0.001), but less was administered intravenously (3.1 ± 1.1 v 4.1 ± 1.3 g, p < 0.001). No differences were observed in adverse events.

Conclusions

This study suggested that combined tranexamic acid administration may be superior for blood conservation, but fully powered randomized controlled trials will be required to confirm these findings and determine the safety advantage and clinical relevance of adding topical tranexamic acid to existing blood conservation strategies.

Network meta-analysis

Primary efficacy outcomes

Red blood cell transfusion rate

In terms of transfusion needs, 40 studies (n = 15 971 patients) were included in the NMA [Table 2]. Intrapericardial TXA (OR 0.80, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.07) did not significantly lower the risk of red cells transfusion, whereas HD-CI (OR 0.38, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.47), LD-CI (OR 0.44, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.56), HD-Bolus (OR 0.50, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.67) and LD-Bolus (OR 0.52, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.67) were more effective than placebo in this regard. HD-Bolus was linked to an increased incidence of transfusion requirements compared with HD-CI TXA (OR 1.30, 95% CI 1.03, 1.65). Patients receiving intrapericardial TXA required transfusions at a considerably higher incidence than those receiving HD-CI (OR 2.11, 95% CI, 0.50 to 2.95), LD-CI (OR 1.83, 95% CI, 1.26 to 2.66), HD-Bolus (OR 1.62, 95% CI, 1.20 to 2.18), or LD-Bolus (OR 1.55, 95% CI 1.29 to 1.85).

Table 2
Network meta-analysis for transfusion needs and thromboembolic events

The results of red-cell transfusion needs were presented in the left lower half and the results of thromboembolic events in the upper right half. Comparisons between treatments should be read from left to right. HD-CI high-dose continuous tranexamic acid infusion; LD-CI low-dose continuous tranexamic acid infusion; HD-Bolus high-dose bolus of tranexamic acid; LD-Bolus low-dose bolus of tranexamic acid; TXA tranexamic acid

HD-CI had the highest SUCRA value (97.6), followed by LD-CI (SUCRA 73.9), HD-Bolus (SUCRA 57.2), and LD-Bolus (SUCRA 51.3). Patients receiving intrapericardial TXA appeared to yield the least benefit from a decreased incidence of transfusion requirements (SUCRA 18.6).

Antifibrinolytics — tranexamic acid for prophylaxis of excessive blood loss — meta-analysis of placebo-controlled randomized controlled trials indicates that tranexamic acid administered before and/or during a procedure is effective in reducing perioperative blood loss, the number of patients transfused, and the volume of blood products transfused; randomized trials comparing tranexamic acid with placebo or no tranexamic acid controls report no differences for stroke, myocardial infarction, renal failure, reoperation for bleeding, or mortality; a meta-analysis also reported lower blood loss volumes when tranexamic acid was initiated after a knee and hip arthroplasty and before tourniquet deflation compared with placebo; one randomized controlled trial did not show efficacy when tranexamic acid was administered after cardiac surgery and continued for 12 h.

### The impact of administration of tranexamic acid in reducing the use of red blood cells and other blood products in cardiac surgery [^44b82b0f]. BMC Anesthesiology (2006). Low credibility.

We therefore decided to investigate the impact of tranexamic acid administration on the use of red blood cells and other blood products using the data collected prospectively in our hospital from 30/10/00 to 21/09/04. This reports comes at a time when the safety of aprotinin is reviewed in light of recent evidence suggesting that aprotinin may have a major negative impact on outcome and that alternatives drugs, such as tranexamic acid, may not only be cheaper but also safer alternatives. Aprotinin is an antifibrinolytic agent whose efficacy on decreasing perioperative transfusion has been extensively and rigorously documented and concerns on its safety has indeed prompted numerous reactions.

### Tranexamic acid – an old drug still going strong and making a revival [^388c7642]. Thrombosis Research (2015). Low credibility.

Experience with tranexamic acid, an indirect fibrinolytic inhibitor, started as soon as it was released from Shosuke Okamoto's lab in the early 1960s. It was first prescribed to females with heavy menstrual blood loss and to patients with hereditary bleeding disorders. Soon the indications were widened to elective surgery because of its blood saving effects. Contraindications are few, most important is ongoing venous or arterial thrombosis and allergy to tranexamic acid, and the doses has to be reduced in renal insufficiency. In randomized controlled trials, however, patients with other risk factors are excluded as well (patients with history of cardiovascular disease, thromboembolism, bleeding diathesis, renal failure with creatinine > 250μmol/L, pregnancy, and patients on treatment with anticoagulants). Recent meta-analyses of several randomized controlled trials in orthopedic arthroplasty have shown that tranexamic acid reduces peri- and postoperative blood loss, blood transfusion requirements and reoperations caused by bleedings. In general, the preoperative dose was 10-15mg/kg i.v. (or 1g), followed or not, by one or two doses, some as continuous infusion i.v. To validate relationship between dose and effect more data are needed. No evidence was found of increased thromboembolic accidents or other adverse events in the patients on tranexamic acid compared to the control groups. In major cardiac surgery tranexamic acid has been used in a large number of controlled trials with various dosing schemes in which the highest dosages seem to be associated with neurotoxicity; therefore a maximum total dose of 100mg/kg especially in patients over 50years of age is recommended by ISMICS (International Society for Minimally Invasive Cardiothoracic Surgery). Other indications for tranexamic acid are reviewed here as well. In recent years the extensive trial in severe trauma with massive bleedings using tranexamic acid was presented, CRASH-2 (Clinical Randomisation of an Antifibrinolytic in Significant Haemorrhage) comprising more than 20,000 patients. It showed that the survival was increased when tranexamic acid was given early after the accident compared to placebo; further studies are taking place is this field to get more information. Of utmost importance is the ongoing WOMAN (World Maternal Antifibrinolytic) a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled trial among 15,000 with clinical diagnosis of postpartum haemorrhage bearing in mind that each year a large number of women in low and middle income countries, die from causes related to childbirth. In summary, we consider tranexamic acid is a drug of great value to reduce almost any kind of bleeding, it is cheap and convenient to use and has principally few contraindications. It may be added, that tranexamic acid is included in the WHOs list of essential medicines.

### Serum concentrations and pharmacokinetics of tranexamic acid after two means of topical administration in massive weight loss skin-reducing surgery [^9cecc35d]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Topical administration of tranexamic acid to reduce bleeding is receiving increasing attention, as it is inexpensive, simple, and possibly beneficial in most surgery. Concerns regarding potential systemic adverse effects such as thromboembolic events and seizures may prevent general use of tranexamic acid. Although serum concentrations after topical application are assumed to be low, proper pharmacokinetic studies of tranexamic acid after topical application are lacking.

Methods

The authors have investigated systemic absorption of tranexamic acid after two means of topical administration in patients undergoing abdominoplasty after massive weight loss: a bolus of 200 mL of 5 mg/ml into the wound cavity versus moistening the wound surface with 20 mL of 25 mg/ml. Twelve patients were recruited in each group. Serum concentrations achieved were compared with those after administration of 1 g as an intravenous bolus to arthroplasty patients. Serial blood samples for tranexamic acid analysis were obtained for up to 24 hours.

Results

After intravenous administration, the peak serum concentration was 66.1 ± 13.0 µg/ml after 6 ± 2 minutes. Peak serum concentration after topical moistening was 5.2 ± 2.6 µg/ml after 80 ± 33 minutes, and in the topical bolus group, it was 4.9 ± 1.8 µg/ml after 359 ± 70 minutes. Topical moistening resulted in homogenous and predictable absorption across the individuals included, whereas topical bolus administration caused variable and unpredictable serum concentrations.

Conclusion

Topical administration of tranexamic acid in patients undergoing abdominoplasty results in low serum concentrations, which are highly unlikely to cause systemic effects.
