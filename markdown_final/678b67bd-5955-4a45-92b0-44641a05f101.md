## Question

What is lipoprotein(a)?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what lipoprotein(a) is. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the molecular structure and genetics that define Lp(a). Then, I should verify the pathophysiology linking Lp(a) to atherogenesis, inflammation, and thrombosis. Next, I will review the epidemiologic and genetic evidence for causality and risk. After that, I need to check current guideline positions on who to test and how to interpret results, including assay issues and units. Finally, I will examine management strategies, including lifestyle, LDL-C–directed therapy, PCSK9 inhibitors, apheresis, and emerging Lp(a)-specific drugs, and close with practical takeaways and uncertainties that still need resolution.

> Let me first confirm the molecular identity and genetics. Lp(a) is an LDL-like particle with a single apoB-100 covalently linked via a disulfide bond to apolipoprotein(a) [apo(a)], a highly glycosylated protein that is structurally homologous to plasminogen and varies in size due to kringle IV type 2 (KIV-2) copy number polymorphisms, which largely determine circulating Lp(a) concentration and explain why levels are ~70–90% heritable and relatively stable from early childhood through adulthood [^116FAxEM] [^113DMtxm] [^11215S7e].

> Wait, let me verify the pathophysiology before I overstate anything. Lp(a) contributes to ASCVD through three interrelated axes: atherogenesis via LDL-like lipid deposition and retention, inflammation via oxidized phospholipids carried on apo(a), and thrombosis via apo(a)'s homology to plasminogen that competitively inhibits fibrinolysis; importantly, Lp(a) shows reduced LDL receptor–mediated clearance due to steric interference from apo(a), which may amplify its residence time and atherogenic potential [^116FAxEM] [^11215S7e] [^1113UmfL].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about clinical significance without anchoring in evidence. Large prospective cohorts, Mendelian randomization, and genome-wide studies consistently show a continuous, approximately log-linear association between Lp(a) concentration and ASCVD events, with risk rising even at "low" Lp(a) levels and remaining independent of LDL-C; very high Lp(a) (> 180 mg/dL or > 430 nmol/L) confers lifetime risk comparable to heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, and elevated Lp(a) is also causally linked to calcific aortic valve stenosis, with no consistent association with venous thromboembolism [^112Hza1U] [^114Bxa35] [^111xsHNy].

> I need to check who should be tested and how to interpret results in practice. Multiple societies now recommend measuring Lp(a) at least once in adulthood, with the NLA endorsing universal adult screening and the EAS/ESC recommending at least one lifetime measurement; thresholds commonly used are < 75 nmol/L (< 30 mg/dL) low risk, 75–125 nmol/L (30–50 mg/dL) intermediate, and ≥ 125 nmol/L (≥ 50 mg/dL) high risk, with very high levels ≥ 180 mg/dL (≥ 430 nmol/L) signaling FH-like risk; testing is especially important in those with premature ASCVD, family history, suspected or confirmed FH, recurrent events despite optimal therapy, or high-risk ancestry, and cascade screening of first-degree relatives is advised when an index case is elevated [^114GxnRF] [^116ypZSD] [^114Bxa35] [^114ShmcG].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost said we should correct LDL-C for Lp(a)-cholesterol to better guide therapy; let me reconsider that. Although Lp(a) carries cholesterol that is included in measured LDL-C, current guidance advises against using fixed correction factors to estimate Lp(a)-C and adjust LDL-C because of poor accuracy and potential misclassification; instead, clinicians should measure Lp(a) directly, interpret risk using particle number (nmol/L preferred), and manage overall apoB-containing particle burden without attempting to back-calculate "true LDL-C" [^1113qn5U] [^116YeapP] [^114r1dJt].

> I should double-check assay issues before concluding anything about thresholds. Lp(a) assays vary in isoform sensitivity, and polyclonal antibodies can misestimate levels depending on apo(a) size; therefore, isoform-insensitive assays calibrated against WHO/IFCC reference material and reporting in nmol/L are preferred, and fixed conversion between mg/dL and nmol/L should be avoided because apo(a) size heterogeneity precludes a reliable factor; despite these limitations, risk discrimination is robust across assays at the population level, though extreme values warrant caution [^114petT1] [^114r1dJt] [^112bq5vi].

> Next, I should review management principles, starting with lifestyle. Even though lifestyle has minimal direct effect on Lp(a) levels, intensive control of blood pressure, glycemia, smoking, diet, and physical activity reduces overall ASCVD risk and should be emphasized; in parallel, LDL-C and non–HDL-C should be lowered aggressively per guideline intensity, because Lp(a)-mediated risk is additive and not mitigated by LDL-C lowering alone [^113dETPg] [^114PYx1k] [^11684Je3].

> Let me verify pharmacologic options and their limitations. Statins do not lower Lp(a) and may modestly increase it, yet they remain first-line for LDL-driven risk reduction; PCSK9 inhibitors reduce Lp(a) by about 20–30% and show greater absolute risk reduction at higher baseline Lp(a), though Lp(a) lowering is not an approved indication; lipoprotein apheresis is FDA-approved for high-risk FH patients with progressive ASCVD and Lp(a) ≥ 60 mg/dL on maximal therapy, but it is invasive, resource-intensive, and not widely available; emerging antisense oligonucleotides and siRNAs targeting apo(a) lower Lp(a) by 70–90% and are in phase 3 outcomes trials, with results expected soon [^115T8x81] [^117X9hLF] [^1179qMaK] [^113WZWoJ].

> But wait, what if the patient has very high Lp(a) and zero coronary calcium — does that negate risk? Observational data suggest CAC and Lp(a) provide additive risk information, and a CAC score of 0 does not fully negate Lp(a)-associated risk, particularly in younger adults; thus, elevated Lp(a) should still prompt intensified primary prevention when global risk is intermediate or higher, even if CAC is absent [^114oEe2g] [^112fu8Ef].

> I should confirm pediatric considerations. Lp(a) reaches adult levels by about age 5, and selective screening is reasonable in high-risk children such as those with suspected FH, unexplained ischemic stroke, or a family history of premature ASCVD or elevated Lp(a); childhood elevations are associated with higher adult ASCVD risk, and cascade screening of family members is appropriate when a child is found to have elevated Lp(a) [^113W5TW1] [^113DMtxm].

> Let me synthesize practical takeaways and ensure internal consistency. Lp(a) is a genetically determined, lifelong, independent, and causal risk factor for ASCVD and calcific aortic stenosis; measure once in adulthood using a standardized, isoform-insensitive assay reported in nmol/L; interpret using guideline thresholds while recognizing a continuum of risk; manage by intensifying control of modifiable risk factors and LDL-C/non–HDL-C, consider PCSK9 inhibitors when additional LDL-C and Lp(a) lowering are needed, reserve apheresis for select high-risk refractory cases, and anticipate that specific Lp(a)-lowering therapies may soon change practice if outcomes trials are positive; importantly, do not attempt to "correct" LDL-C for Lp(a)-C, and do not let a statin-associated small rise in Lp(a) deter statin use given clear net clinical benefit [^114GxnRF] [^116ypZSD] [^114PYx1k] [^1113qn5U] [^115T8x81].

> Finally, I need to ensure I've captured uncertainties and next steps. We still need definitive proof that selectively lowering Lp(a) reduces hard cardiovascular events, clarification of optimal thresholds across diverse ancestries, and broader implementation of standardized assays; nonetheless, the weight of genetic, epidemiologic, and mechanistic evidence justifies current screening and risk-intensification strategies while we await phase 3 outcomes data for apo(a)-targeted therapies [^113WZWoJ] [^112Hza1U] [^116FAxEM].

Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] is an LDL-like particle covalently bound to apolipoprotein(a) [apo(a)], conferring **independent, causal risk** for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and calcific aortic valve stenosis (CAVS) [^116FAxEM] [^114Bxa35]. Lp(a) levels are **~70–90% genetically determined** [^116FAxEM], vary widely by ancestry [^113cfHjU], and remain relatively stable over life [^11215S7e]. Elevated Lp(a) promotes atherogenesis, inflammation, and impaired fibrinolysis [^116FAxEM], and is not mitigated by LDL-C lowering alone [^1137pjHN]. Guidelines recommend measuring Lp(a) at least once in adulthood [^114GxnRF], with **≥ 50 mg/dL (≥ 125 nmol/L)** considered high risk; management centers on aggressive control of modifiable risk factors and LDL-C, with PCSK9 inhibitors offering modest Lp(a) reduction and apheresis reserved for extreme cases [^114PYx1k] [^1179qMaK]. Specific Lp(a)-lowering therapies (antisense/siRNA) are in phase 3 trials and may reshape care if outcomes improve [^113WZWoJ].

---

## Structure and composition

- **Core LDL-like particle**: Lp(a) contains apoB-100 and lipid components (cholesterol, triglycerides, phospholipids) similar to LDL [^115rm4hY].
- **Apo(a) moiety**: Apo(a) is covalently linked to apoB-100 via a disulfide bond; it is homologous to plasminogen and contains kringle IV repeats that vary in number, causing size polymorphism and affecting Lp(a) levels [^1172Aw4S].
- **OxPL content**: Lp(a) carries oxidized phospholipids, contributing to proinflammatory and proatherogenic effects [^113wy3sZ].

---

## Genetic determinants and regulation

- **LPA locus**: Lp(a) levels are predominantly determined by the LPA gene [^113DMtxm], with kringle IV-2 copy number variation explaining ~30–70% of variability [^114r1dJt] [^113DMtxm].
- **Ethnic variation**: Median Lp(a) levels differ by ancestry, with higher levels in individuals of African and South Asian descent compared to European or East Asian populations [^113cfHjU].
- **Stability**: Lp(a) levels are relatively stable throughout life and minimally influenced by lifestyle factors [^11215S7e].

---

## Pathophysiological mechanisms

Lp(a) contributes to cardiovascular disease through **multiple mechanisms**:

| **Mechanism** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Atherogenesis | Lp(a) deposits in the arterial wall, promoting foam cell formation and plaque development [^1172Aw4S] |
| Inflammation | OxPLs on Lp(a) activate innate immunity and amplify vascular inflammation [^1113UmfL] [^114Bxa35] |
| Impaired fibrinolysis | Apo(a) homology to plasminogen inhibits fibrinolysis, promoting thrombosis [^1172Aw4S] |
| Calcific aortic valve stenosis | Lp(a) promotes valve calcification, independently increasing CAVS risk [^113wy3sZ] |

---

## Epidemiological evidence and clinical significance

- **ASCVD risk**: Elevated Lp(a) is independently associated with coronary artery disease, ischemic stroke, and peripheral artery disease [^115j3RpZ] [^111hQSz1].
- **CAVS risk**: High Lp(a) is causally linked to calcific aortic valve stenosis, independent of traditional risk factors [^111xsHNy].
- **Residual risk**: Lp(a) confers risk even when LDL-C is well controlled, highlighting its role in residual cardiovascular risk [^1137pjHN].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Several professional societies provide guidance on **Lp(a) measurement and management**:

| **Society** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| National Lipid Association (NLA) | Measure Lp(a) at least once in adulthood; ≥ 50 mg/dL (≥ 125 nmol/L) is high risk [^114GxnRF] |
| European Atherosclerosis Society (EAS) | Measure Lp(a) once in adulthood; ≥ 50 mg/dL is high risk [^114Bxa35] |
| Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS) | Consider Lp(a) measurement in intermediate-risk patients or those with family history of premature ASCVD [^115mDPA4] |

---

## Therapeutic strategies

Currently, there are **no approved therapies specifically targeting Lp(a)**; management focuses on:

- **Lifestyle modifications**: Diet, exercise, and smoking cessation are recommended, though they have minimal direct impact on Lp(a) levels [^113dETPg].
- **LDL-C lowering**: Statins, ezetimibe, and PCSK9 inhibitors are used to aggressively lower LDL-C, indirectly mitigating Lp(a)-mediated risk [^114PYx1k].
- **PCSK9 inhibitors**: Modestly reduce Lp(a) by ~20–30% and are considered in high-risk patients with elevated Lp(a) [^117X9hLF].
- **Lipoprotein apheresis**: Reserved for extreme Lp(a) elevations (> 150 mg/dL) with progressive ASCVD despite optimal therapy [^11684Je3].
- **Emerging therapies**: Antisense oligonucleotides and siRNA targeting apo(a) are in phase 3 trials, showing potential to reduce Lp(a) by > 70–80% [^113WZWoJ].

---

## Current limitations and future directions

- **Standardization**: Assay variability and lack of harmonized reference materials limit accurate Lp(a) measurement [^112bq5vi].
- **Outcome data**: Large-scale trials are needed to confirm that specifically lowering Lp(a) reduces cardiovascular events [^113wy3sZ].
- **Personalized medicine**: Integrating Lp(a) into risk assessment and tailoring therapy based on genetic and clinical factors is a key future goal [^116FAxEM].

---

Lipoprotein(a) is a **genetically determined, LDL-like lipoprotein** that independently increases the risk of ASCVD and CAVS through atherogenic, inflammatory, and antifibrinolytic mechanisms. Routine measurement is recommended in adulthood, with management centered on aggressive risk-factor control and LDL-C lowering, while specific Lp(a)-lowering therapies are under investigation.

### Lipoprotein (a): a genetically determined, causal, and prevalent risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^116FAxEM]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2022). Medium credibility.

High levels of lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)], an apoB100-containing lipoprotein, are an independent and causal risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases through mechanisms associated with increased atherogenesis, inflammation, and thrombosis. Lp(a) is predominantly a monogenic cardiovascular risk determinant, with ≈70% to ≥ 90% of interindividual heterogeneity in levels being genetically determined. The 2 major protein components of Lp(a) particles are apoB100 and apolipoprotein(a). Lp(a) remains a risk factor for cardiovascular disease development even in the setting of effective reduction of plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and apoB100. Despite its demonstrated contribution to atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease burden, we presently lack standardization and harmonization of assays, universal guidelines for diagnosing and providing risk assessment, and targeted treatments to lower Lp(a). There is a clinical need to understand the genetic and biological basis for variation in Lp(a) levels and its relationship to disease in different ancestry groups. This scientific statement capitalizes on the expertise of a diverse basic science and clinical workgroup to highlight the history, biology, pathophysiology, and emerging clinical evidence in the Lp(a) field. Herein, we address key knowledge gaps and future directions required to mitigate the atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk attributable to elevated Lp(a) levels.

### How should public health recommendations address Lp (a) measurement, a causative risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD)? [^112Hvdjh]. Atherosclerosis (2022). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Elevated concentrations of Lipoprotein (a) [Lp(a)] is an inherited, causal risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). This study aims to investigate the clinical utility for patients, and the economic benefit to healthcare systems and society of measuring Lp(a) concentrations more widely today.

Methods

We conducted a structured literature review to identify the economic and health benefits and costs of measuring the Lp(a) concentration, potential barriers hindering the uptake of the measure, and potential solutions to address them. These findings were then discussed in an advisory board attended by experts and patient organisations.

Results

It was found that if Lp(a) concentration is measured more widely today, patients, healthcare system and society would experience clinical and economic benefits even before specific Lp(a) lowering pharmacological treatments become available. Furthermore, a wider uptake of the Lp(a) measurement would support the development of epidemiological data.

Conclusions

For Lp(a) measurement to be more widely used, key barriers which are hindering its uptake need to be addressed. These include i) the perception that the measure may have limited clinical value, ii) lack of awareness on Lp(a), iii) lack of data on the CV benefit of reducing Lp(a), iv) technical and clinical guidelines barriers, and v) healthcare system barriers. Scientific communities and industry should collaborate to address technical challenges and deficiencies in clinical guidelines. However, policy intervention will be crucial for national ASCVD plans to acknowledge the importance of Lp(a).

### What's next for lipoprotein (a)? A National Lipid Association report from an expert panel discussion [^113WZWoJ]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2024). Medium credibility.

This is an exciting time in the lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] field. Attention to this important lipoprotein and potent cardiovascular risk marker is transitioning from the purview of the specialist to that of the general practitioner. Its clinical adoption as an important test is increasing in momentum. There is evidence that Lp(a) contributes to the pathology of atherothrombotic disease, aortic valve stenosis, and childhood ischemic strokes. Three large, Phase 3, randomized, cardiovascular outcomes trials in which Lp(a) is specifically and substantially lowered by mRNA-directed therapies in secondary prevention settings are in progress and will start to report results as early as 2025. Regardless of outcomes, there remain many unanswered questions about Lp(a), ranging from fundamental unknowns about Lp(a) biology, to the complexity of its measurement, optimal screening strategies, and clinical management in individuals with high Lp(a) levels both with and without overt cardiovascular disease. Accordingly, The National Lipid Association (NLA) convened an Expert Discussion involving clinicians and fundamental researchers to identify knowledge gaps in our understanding of Lp(a) biology and pathogenicity and to discuss approaches in the management of elevated Lp(a) in different clinical settings.

### Why, how and in whom should we measure levels of lipoprotein (a): a review of the latest evidence and clinical implications [^11215S7e]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

The objectives of this narrative review are threefold. First, we discuss underlying pathophysiological mechanisms that make Lp(a) a potent contributor to cardiovascular risk. Second, we discuss the current landscape of Lp(a) measurement, including available assay techniques, standardisation efforts and interpretation of results, with a particular focus on addressing the ongoing challenges in clinical application. Third, we outline recommendations regarding who should undergo Lp(a) testing, incorporating insights from recent clinical practice guidelines. By synthesising the latest data, this review seeks to inform clinicians and provide practical guidance on integrating Lp(a) measurement into routine cardiovascular risk assessment. Lastly, we explore emerging therapeutic strategies targeting Lp(a), underscoring their potential to reshape clinical practice in the future.

1.1 Pathophysiological role

Lp(a) is a structurally unique lipoprotein particle consisting of an LDL‐like core (apolipoprotein‐B‐100) that is attached to apo(a) via a disulfide bond. Though both LDL and Lp(a) contain one apolipoprotein‐B (ApoB) molecule, Lp(a) does not bind to LDL receptors with the same affinity as LDL due to the steric interference of the apo(a) moiety on Lp(a). Additionally, apo(a) alters the shape of ApoB, which may in turn decrease binding to the LDL receptor. Decreased uptake by the LDL receptor and the presence of oxidised phospholipids on the apo(a) moiety overall contribute to an approximately six‐fold higher atherogenicity for Lp(a) when compared to LDL. Lp(a) levels are predominantly determined by the LPA gene, and heritability estimates exceed 90%. Unlike other lipid markers, Lp(a) levels remain relatively stable throughout life and are minimally influenced by lifestyle factors.

### Lipoprotein (a) as a cardiovascular risk factor: current status [^113FyDeV]. European Heart Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Future needs in basic and clinical research on lipoprotein(a) and apolipoprotein(a)

The Consensus Panel is convinced that further international effort is required in different ethnicities to assess the atherothrombotic risk due to the Lp(a) particle on the one hand and to apolipoprotein(a) on the other. The potential contribution of Lp(a)-associated phospholipase A2, and equally of Lp(a)-associated oxidized phospholipids, to the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying such elevated risk remains indeterminate. Both cutting-edge basic research, rigorously designed prospective studies and intervention trials of selective Lp(a) lowering agents are required to attain these goals. Furthermore, it is entirely appropriate that Lp(a), as a causal, independent risk factor, should be integrated into existing treatment algorithms. Finally, randomized, controlled intervention trials with selective reduction in plasma lipoprotein(a) levels to reduce CVD in both primary and secondary prevention settings are urgently needed in order to define more precisely who to treat and to what targets.

### Lipoprotein (a): an important cardiovascular risk factor and a clinical conundrum [^111HMuvW]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Elevated plasma concentrations of lipoprotein(a) (Lp[a]) are an emerging risk factor for the development of coronary heart disease (CHD). Recent genetic and epidemiologic data have provided strong evidence for a causal role of Lp(a) in CHD. Despite these developments, which have attracted increasing interest from clinicians and basic scientists, many unanswered questions persist. The true pathogenic mechanism of Lp(a) remains a mystery. Significant uncertainty exists concerning the appropriate use of Lp(a) in the clinical setting. No therapeutic intervention remains that can specifically lower plasma Lp(a) concentrations, although the list of compounds that lower Lp(a) and LDL continues to expand.

### A focused update to the 2019 NLA scientific statement on use of lipoprotein (a) in clinical practice [^112ndvpS]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2024). Medium credibility.

Since the 2019 National Lipid Association (NLA) Scientific Statement on Use of Lipoprotein(a) in Clinical Practice was issued, accumulating epidemiological data have clarified the relationship between lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] level and cardiovascular disease risk and risk reduction. Therefore, the NLA developed this focused update to guide clinicians in applying this emerging evidence in clinical practice. We now have sufficient evidence to support the recommendation to measure Lp(a) levels at least once in every adult for risk stratification. Individuals with Lp(a) levels < 75 nmol/L (30 mg/dL) are considered low risk, individuals with Lp(a) levels ≥ 125 nmol/L (50 mg/dL) are considered high risk, and individuals with Lp(a) levels between 75 and 125 nmol/L (30–50 mg/dL) are at intermediate risk. Cascade screening of first-degree relatives of patients with elevated Lp(a) can identify additional individuals at risk who require intervention. Patients with elevated Lp(a) should receive early, more-intensive risk factor management, including lifestyle modification and lipid-lowering drug therapy in high-risk individuals, primarily to reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved an indication for lipoprotein apheresis (which reduces both Lp(a) and LDL-C) in high-risk patients with familial hypercholesterolemia and documented coronary or peripheral artery disease whose Lp(a) level remains ≥ 60 mg/dL [∼150 nmol/L)] and LDL-C ≥ 100 mg/dL on maximally tolerated lipid-lowering therapy. Although Lp(a) is an established independent causal risk factor for cardiovascular disease, and despite the high prevalence of Lp(a) elevation (∼1 of 5 individuals), measurement rates are low, warranting improved screening strategies for cardiovascular disease prevention.

### Use of lipoprotein (a) in clinical practice: a biomarker whose time has come. A scientific statement from the National Lipid Association [^116tfTKE]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2022). Medium credibility.

Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] is a well-recognized, independent risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, with elevated levels estimated to be prevalent in 20% of the population. Observational and genetic evidence strongly support a causal relationship between high plasma concentrations of Lp(a) and increased risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease-related events, such as myocardial infarction and stroke, and valvular aortic stenosis. In this scientific statement, we review an array of evidence-based considerations for testing of Lp(a) in clinical practice and the utilization of Lp(a) levels to inform treatment strategies in primary and secondary prevention.

Guidance for the Use of Lipoprotein(a) in Clinical Practice

Lipoprotein(a): Clinical Considerations for Diagnosis and Testing

Testing for elevated lipoprotein(a) is not routinely performed in clinical practice despite recommendations from numerous medical societies for cascade screening in people with a family history of premature ASCVD and/or elevated lipoprotein(a) (Table 2). In a 2022 Scientific Statement, the American Heart Association recommended testing lipoprotein(a) in individuals with a family/personal history of ASCVD. It proposed that once standardization of lipoprotein(a) assays is achieved, a reassessment of broader population‐based screening should be considered. Furthermore, the Canadian Cardiovascular Society and the European Atherosclerosis Society advise lipoprotein(a) testing at least once in all adults, irrespective of family history. The success of cascade screening for identifying affected family members has already been demonstrated in familial hypercholesterolemia and has been shown to be cost‐effective.

Table 2
Recommendations for lipoprotein(a) Testing,

Practically, current lipoprotein(a) testing requires only routine, nonfasting blood draws, making it convenient for patients and health care professionals. While plasma lipoprotein(a) levels can be measured in nmol/L or mg/dL, intensive CVD risk factor management should be recommended for all individuals with elevated lipoprotein(a) (high risk is defined as ≥ 50 mg/dL [> 125 nmol/L]). The benefits of lipoprotein(a) testing include improved CVD risk stratification by proactively identifying individuals at ASCVD risk and reclassifying risk in patients with clinical ASCVD. From a healthcare system perspective, early and intensive CVD risk factor management in individuals with elevated lipoprotein(a) may lead to significant long‐term cost savings.

### A focused update to the 2019 NLA scientific statement on use of lipoprotein (a) in clinical practice [^116ypZSD]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2024). High credibility.

Professional society guidance on lipoprotein(a) for risk assessment — the 2019 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guideline identifies elevated Lp(a) ≥ 125 nmol/L as a risk-enhancing factor that would favor statin initiation or intensification for primary prevention in borderline or intermediate risk individuals. The 2022 European Atherosclerosis Society recommends measuring Lp(a) at least once in all adults, uses levels ≥ 125 nmol/L to rule-in ASCVD risk, and states that individuals at low or moderate 10-year CVD risk by SCORE would be recommended for more intensive treatment of LDL-C, systolic blood pressure, and lifestyle risk factors when Lp(a) is elevated. The Canadian Cardiovascular Society recommends measuring Lp(a) once in a patient's lifetime with initial lipid screening and considers Lp(a) ≥ 50 mg/dL (or ≥ 100 nmol/L) a risk modifier warranting statin therapy in intermediate-risk patients and earlier, more intensive lifestyle management in low-risk patients.

### Lipoprotein (a): a risk factor for atherosclerosis and an emerging therapeutic target [^114f2cNs]. Heart (2022). Medium credibility.

Lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)) is a complex circulating lipoprotein, and increasing evidence has demonstrated its role as a risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and as a possible therapeutic target. Lp(a) atherogenic effects are attributed to several potential mechanisms in addition to cholesterol accumulation in the arterial wall, including proinflammatory effects mainly mediated by oxidised phospholipids. Several studies have found a causal and independent relationship between Lp(a) levels and cardiovascular risk. Furthermore, several studies also suggest a causal association between Lp(a) levels and calcific aortic valve stenosis. Available lipid-lowering agents have at best moderate impact on Lp(a) levels. Among available therapies, antibody proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors are the most effective in reducing Lp(a). Potent Lp(a)-lowering treatments that target LPA expression are under development. Lp(a) level measurement poses some challenges due to the absence of a definitive reference method and the reporting of Lp(a) values as molar (nanomoles per litre (nmol/L)) or mass concentrations (milligrams per decilitre (mg/dL)) by different assays. Currently, Lp(a) measurement is recommended to refine cardiovascular risk in specific clinical settings, that is, in individuals with a family history of premature ASCVD, in patients with ASCVD not explained by standard risk factors or in those with recurrent events despite optimal management of traditional risk factors. Patients with high Lp(a) levels should be managed with more intensive approaches to treat other modifiable cardiovascular risk factors. Overall, this review focuses on Lp(a) as an ASCVD risk factor and therapeutic target. Furthermore, it reports practical recommendations for Lp(a) measurement and interpretation and updated evidence on Lp(a)-lowering approaches.

### Lipid measurements in the management of cardiovascular diseases: practical recommendations a scientific statement from the National Lipid Association writing group [^114petT1]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2021). High credibility.

Lipoprotein(a) measurement — Lipoprotein (a) (Lp[a]) is described as an independent risk factor for ASCVD, yet clinical assays used in patient care are not well standardized; the National Lipid Association recommends an immunochemical assay calibrated against WHO/IFCCLM secondary reference material, with the preferred reporting unit in nmol/L. Reported performance indicates Lp(a) assay variability can be as high as 26% CV and the precision of most Lp(a) assays ranges between 10% to 12%. The 2018 AHA/ACC Multi-Society guideline classified Lp(a) measurement as a risk enhancer that could help guide care for persons at intermediate ASCVD risk, and measuring Lp(a) may also be valuable in patients with a strong family history of ASCVD, those who do not fully respond to statin therapy, or those with ASCVD events despite evidence-based lipid-lowering therapy.

### Lipid measurements in the management of cardiovascular diseases: practical recommendations a scientific statement from the National Lipid Association writing group [^116jNhCG]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2021). High credibility.

Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] — measurement is supported in defined risk settings. Lp(a) is elevated in approximately 20% of the population and is strongly associated with increased risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events. Recommendations include using assays calibrated against established reference material and measuring to refine risk when premature ASCVD has occurred in adults (< 55 y of age in men; < 65 y of age in women) in the individual or family. Additionally, persons with primary severe hypercholesterolemia (LDL > 190 mg/dL), suspected familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), or those at very high risk of ASCVD should have Lp(a) measured to better define potential benefit from PCSK9 inhibitor therapy; the 2018 AHA/ACC Multi-Society Cholesterol Guideline has also identified Lp(a) as a risk enhancer test in patients at intermediate risk.

### A focused update to the 2019 NLA scientific statement on use of lipoprotein (a) in clinical practice [^113AoqqE]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2024). High credibility.

National Lipid Association (NLA) lipoprotein(a) update — There is sufficient evidence to support the recommendation to measure lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)) levels at least once in every adult for risk stratification. Risk categories are defined as follows: individuals with Lp(a) levels < 75 nmol/L (30 mg/dL) are considered low risk, individuals with Lp(a) levels ≥ 125 nmol/L (50 mg/dL) are considered high risk, and individuals with Lp(a) levels between 75 and 125 nmol/L (30–50 mg/dL) are at intermediate risk; cascade screening of first-degree relatives of patients with elevated Lp(a) can identify additional individuals at risk.

5 CONCLUSIONS

Lp(a) has emerged as a critical yet underrecognised cardiovascular risk factor, with robust evidence demonstrating a causal link between elevated levels and cardiovascular disease. Unlike traditional lipid markers, Lp(a) levels are predominantly genetically determined, relatively stable throughout life and minimally influenced by lifestyle factors. These unique characteristics make Lp(a) an important risk factor for lifelong cardiovascular risk stratification. Importantly, elevated Lp(a) identifies a subset of high‐risk individuals who may remain undetected using conventional risk assessment tools. Effective management in such cases includes optimising traditional risk factors, evaluating for subclinical atherosclerosis, considering statin therapy and, in some instances, exploring the use of PCSK9 inhibitors and aspirin. Given these insights, there is a strong case for routine Lp(a) testing, particularly among high‐risk groups such as individuals with premature ASCVD, a family history of cardiovascular disease, recurrent cardiovascular events despite optimal therapy and populations with inherently higher Lp(a) levels, including those of African and South Asian ancestry. Routine testing would enable earlier identification of at‐risk individuals and inform personalised preventive strategies.

Looking ahead, further research is essential to close existing knowledge gaps. Large‐scale trials such as Lp(a) HORIZON (pelacarsen), OCEAN(a)‐Outcomes (olpasiran) and ACCLAIM (lepodisiran) are poised to provide critical data on whether lowering Lp(a) levels translates into meaningful reductions in cardiovascular events. As these and other studies progress, they will play a pivotal role in shaping future guidelines, advancing Lp(a)‐targeted therapies, and ultimately, transforming cardiovascular risk management.

This figure illustrates the combined impact of elevated Lp(a) levels and CAC score on the risk of ASCVD. These findings suggest that Lp(a) and CAC score provide additive information for prognosticating cardiovascular risk among asymptomatic individuals.

4.2 Patient communication

Effective communication of elevated Lp(a) results is crucial for patient engagement and long‐term risk management. Clinicians should begin by emphasising the genetic nature of Lp(a), explaining that levels are predominantly inherited and remain stable throughout life. This understanding helps patients recognise that elevated Lp(a) is not a result of lifestyle choices, reducing potential feelings of blame or guilt. Framing Lp(a) as a lifelong risk factor allows for tailored discussions on long‐term cardiovascular risk, reinforcing the importance of proactive management despite the absence of clinically available Lp(a)‐specific therapies. Patients may express concern over limited treatment options specifically targeting Lp(a). Clinicians should acknowledge this reality while emphasising that actionable strategies exist. Optimising traditional risk factors, such as blood pressure, LDL cholesterol and glycemic control, can substantially reduce overall cardiovascular risk. Additionally, lifestyle modifications, including adherence to a heart‐healthy diet, regular physical activity, smoking cessation and maintaining a healthy weight, remain cornerstones of risk reduction. For select high‐risk individuals, discussing aspirin use, statin therapy and the potential role of PCSK9 inhibitors may be appropriate, as discussed below. Importantly, clinicians should reassure patients that emerging Lp(a)‐targeted therapies are on the horizon, providing hope for future tailored treatments.

### Lipoprotein (a): the perpetual supporting actor [^111FGKdR]. European Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Lp(a): what do guidelines tell us?

The 2010 consensus document on Lp(a) from the European Society of Cardiology proposed a linear association between Lp(a) levels and CVD events, which might be too simplistic given the level of interaction and modification that LDL-C levels appear to have on cardiovascular risk. Measurement of Lp(a) is recommended in clinical practice in the following settings: (i) premature CVD, (ii) FH, (iii) a family history of CVD or elevated Lp(a), and (iv) recurrent CVD despite optimal statin therapy and ≥ 5% 10 year risk of fatal CVD according to Systematic COronary Risk Evaluation (SCORE). The treatment goal for CVD patients is first to lower LDL-C levels and reach desirable Lp(a) levels < 50 mg/dL. However, to date, there is no evidence that lowering Lp(a) really does improve clinical outcomes or that this molecule is a critical target to decrease residual risk. Statin treatment is not associated with a reduction of Lp(a), as opposed to PCSK9 inhibitors, which have been demonstrated to significantly reduce Lp(a) by 20–30%. In the case of proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors, Lp(a) reduction is systematically correlated with LDL-C reduction, and it is most probably the increased levels of LDL-receptor expression typically induced by PCSK9 inhibitors that lead to subsequent lowering of circulating Lp(a) levels. The beneficial effect of PCSK9 inhibition on clinical events therefore seems to be mediated by reductions in LDL-C levels, while it remains unclear what benefit the concomitant decrease of Lp(a) might have. Recently, treatment with antisense oligonucleotides targeting Apo(a) in persons with elevated Lp(a) has shown very impressive results in lowering Lp(a) levels (≥ 70–80% decrease). A clinical study of cardiovascular outcomes is now required to evaluate the impact of specifically reducing Lp(a). A phase 2B trial will start to recruit patients with elevated Lp(a), defined as Lp(a) ≥ 60 mg/dL, and established CVD to test the efficacy and safety of ISIS 681257 administered subcutaneously with a target sample size of 270 participants (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT03070782).

### Lipoprotein (a) as a cardiovascular risk factor: current status [^115xSH1h]. European Heart Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Aims

The aims of the study were, first, to critically evaluate lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] as a cardiovascular risk factor and, second, to advise on screening for elevated plasma Lp(a), on desirable levels, and on therapeutic strategies.

Methods and Results

The robust and specific association between elevated Lp(a) levels and increased cardiovascular disease (CVD)/coronary heart disease (CHD) risk, together with recent genetic findings, indicates that elevated Lp(a), like elevated LDL-cholesterol, is causally related to premature CVD/CHD. The association is continuous without a threshold or dependence on LDL- or non-HDL-cholesterol levels. Mechanistically, elevated Lp(a) levels may either induce a prothrombotic/anti-fibrinolytic effect as apolipoprotein(a) resembles both plasminogen and plasmin but has no fibrinolytic activity, or may accelerate atherosclerosis because, like LDL, the Lp(a) particle is cholesterol-rich, or both. We advise that Lp(a) be measured once, using an isoform-insensitive assay, in subjects at intermediate or high CVD/CHD risk with premature CVD, familial hypercholesterolaemia, a family history of premature CVD and/or elevated Lp(a), recurrent CVD despite statin treatment, ≥ 3% 10-year risk of fatal CVD according to European guidelines, and/or ≥ 10% 10-year risk of fatal + non-fatal CHD according to US guidelines. As a secondary priority after LDL-cholesterol reduction, we recommend a desirable level for Lp(a) < 80th percentile (less than ∼50 mg/dL). Treatment should primarily be niacin 1–3 g/day, as a meta-analysis of randomized, controlled intervention trials demonstrates reduced CVD by niacin treatment. In extreme cases, LDL-apheresis is efficacious in removing Lp(a).

Conclusion

We recommend screening for elevated Lp(a) in those at intermediate or high CVD/CHD risk, a desirable level < 50 mg/dL as a function of global cardiovascular risk, and use of niacin for Lp(a) and CVD/CHD risk reduction.

### Existing and emerging strategies to lower lipoprotein (a) [^113GRb1B]. Atherosclerosis (2022). Medium credibility.

Abundant evidence links elevated levels of lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)) to higher cardiovascular risk, leaving clinicians with the challenge of what measures to take to mitigate Lp(a)-associated risk. Some therapies that may reduce cardiovascular risk, such as aspirin, statins, fibrates, and ezetimibe, have little effect on Lp(a) and in some cases may even increase its concentration. Other agents that reduce levels of Lp(a), such as niacin or cholesteryl ester transfer protein inhibitors, have neutral or only slightly favorable effects on cardiovascular outcomes. The only currently available therapeutic approaches that lower Lp(a) and reduce cardiovascular risk are PCSK9 inhibitors and lipoprotein apheresis. For PCSK9 inhibitors, the magnitude of clinical benefit is associated with the baseline level of Lp(a) and appears to be associated with the degree of Lp(a) reduction. Antisense oligonucleotides and small interfering RNA agents targeting apolipoprotein(a) have the potential to reduce circulating Lp(a) concentrations by more than 70%. The results of cardiovascular outcomes trials will determine whether such substantial reductions in Lp(a) are associated with meaningful clinical benefit.

### HEART UK consensus statement on lipoprotein (a): a call to action [^115wxbB2]. Atherosclerosis (2019). Medium credibility.

Lipoprotein(a), Lp(a), is a modified atherogenic low-density lipoprotein particle that contains apolipoprotein(a). Its levels are highly heritable and variable in the population. This consensus statement by HEART UK is based on the evidence that Lp(a) is an independent cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factor, provides recommendations for its measurement in clinical practice and reviews current and emerging therapeutic strategies to reduce CVD risk. Ten statements summarise the most salient points for practitioners and patients with high Lp(a). HEART UK recommends that Lp(a) is measured in adults as follows: 1) those with a personal or family history of premature atherosclerotic CVD; 2) those with first-degree relatives who have Lp(a) levels > 200 nmol/l; 3) patients with familial hypercholesterolemia; 4) patients with calcific aortic valve stenosis and 5) those with borderline (but < 15%) 10-year risk of a cardiovascular event. The management of patients with raised Lp(a) levels should include: 1) reducing overall atherosclerotic risk; 2) controlling dyslipidemia with a desirable non-HDL-cholesterol level of < 100 mg/dl (2.5 mmol/l) and 3) consideration of lipoprotein apheresis.

Mechanistic pathways linking Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] to atherosclerosis. This figure illustrates the central role of Lp(a) in promoting atherogenesis, inflammation and thrombosis. Elevated Lp(a) levels contribute to atherogenesis through its structural similarity with low‐density lipoprotein (LDL) particles. Oxidised phospholipids carried on Lp(a) promote inflammation that amplifies vascular immune activation and foam cell formation. Thrombosis risk is increased via structural homology between apolipoprotein(a) and plasminogen, inhibiting fibrinolysis and promoting clot formation. Collectively, these mechanisms link elevated Lp(a) to heightened cardiovascular risk. Apo(a), apolipoprotein(a);, cholesteryl ester;, free cholesterol;, oxidiseized phospholipids;, triglyceride.

### Lipoprotein (a) as a cardiovascular risk factor: current status [^114PZass]. European Heart Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Epidemiology

Findings from earlier prospective studies suggest that the relation between Lp(a) concentration and the risk of CVD may involve a threshold and that the association may be more marked among individuals with elevated LDL cholesterol. – Individual studies, however, are rarely sufficiently powered to assess the shape of the relation or to make precise estimates of relative risk within subgroups of the study populations such as among individuals with high rather than low LDL cholesterol levels.

An early meta-analysis of 18 prospective studies of general populations that was published before 2000, which reported on a pooled analysis of 4000 coronary heart disease (CHD) cases, suggested that the combined relative risk of CHD for individuals in the top vs. bottom thirds of baseline Lp(a) concentrations was 1.7 (95% CI: 1.4–1.9). An updated meta-analysis of 31 prospective studies, involving a total of 9870 CHD cases, suggested that the corresponding combined risk was more modest (relative risk: 1.5; 1.3–1.8). Subgroups defined by other characteristics pre-specified for investigation, notably study size, sample storage characteristics, and Lp(a) assay isoform sensitivity, were not significantly different.

Although the evidence from literature-based meta-analyses of prospective studies suggests the potential importance of Lp(a) in CHD, it does not provide sufficient detail to allow the assessment of the relevance of this lipoprotein to CVD prevention and treatment. For example, it is not possible to determine, from a literature-based meta-analysis, whether Lp(a) is associated with CHD throughout the concentration range (similar to blood pressure and LDL cholesterol) or whether Lp(a) is particularly atherothrombogenic in specific subgroups of individuals (such as in those with high LDL cholesterol level). Re-analysis of individual participant data from a comprehensive set of prospective epidemiological studies (i.e. individual participant data meta-analysis) can help overcome several of the limitations of individual studies or literature-based meta-analyses of individual studies. However, because some of the earlier studies had problems with the correct measurement of Lp(a) in, for example, frozen samples, the risk estimates reported below should be considered minimal estimates.

### Elevated lipoprotein (a) is common in people with familial hypercholesterolemia and negative genetic screening [^1146nXGF]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

What is the clinical question being addressed?

Can we determine if elevated Lp(a) levels are more common in patients with a clinical presentation of familial hypercholesterolemia in whom no mutation was identified?

What is the main finding?

Results show high rates (> 50%) of an alternative, genetic lipoprotein-mediated contributor to ASCVD, suggesting routine Lp(a) measurement in all such patients globally.

Lipoprotein (a) [Lp(a)] is a largely genetically determined cardiovascular risk marker that is strongly and monotonically associated with composite atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) independently of other traditional cardiovascular risk factors. Furthermore, there is strong genetic evidence for its causal relationship with ASCVD and very high levels of Lp(a) (> 200 mg/dL) may represent a comparable lifetime risk of coronary heart disease to genetically confirmed familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) while being up to twice as prevalent. Despite this, understanding of its clinical relevance in cardiovascular risk assessment is limited in many medical circles.

Given the possibility that elevated Lp(a) levels can inflate measured low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) levels, there is a risk of misdiagnosing FH when LDL-C levels are evaluated without considering Lp(a) measurements. Accurate differentiation between phenotypic FH and genetically confirmed FH, in the context of Lp(a) levels, is crucial given also that the Lp(a) component of measured LDL-C is not lowered by conventional lipid-lowering agents. In this article, pseudo-FH refers to a presentation of possible FH with negative FH genetics. Based on a 2024 focused update of National Lipid Association 2019 guidelines, Lp(a) > 50 mg/dL (> 125 nmol/L) is considered to be high risk and < 30 mg/dL (< 75 nmol/L) low risk, with an intermediate risk category between these 2 values. When considering the general population, between 16% to 24% of people may have Lp(a) > 50 mg/dL and around 35% > 30 mg/dL.

The aim of this work was to determine Lp(a) levels in a cohort of patients with pseudo-FH.

Lipoprotein(a) testing and risk categorization — Adults (aged ≥ 18 y): measurement of Lp(a) in all adults is reasonable to refine risk assessment for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events; youth (aged < 18 y): selective screening of Lp(a) is recommended in high-risk patients such as clinically suspected or genetically confirmed familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), ischemic stroke of unknown cause, first-degree relatives with a history of premature ASCVD (age < 55 years in men, < 65 years in women), or first-degree relatives with elevated Lp(a); when Lp(a) levels are used for ASCVD risk assessment, it is reasonable to use measurements ≥ 125 nmol/L (≥ 50 mg/dL) as levels suggesting high risk, levels < 75 nmol/L (< 30 mg/dL) as low risk, and levels between as intermediate risk.

### Lipoprotein (a) in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and aortic stenosis: a European Atherosclerosis Society consensus statement [^114Bxa35]. European Heart Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Since the 2010 European Atherosclerosis Society (EAS) consensus statement, knowledge about the role of lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and aortic valve stenosis (AVS) has expanded substantially (Box 1 and Graphical Abstract). Strong evidence for causality for ASCVD prompted the development of novel drugs that specifically lower Lp(a) levels. New genetic, mechanistic, and imaging insights also suggest therapeutic potential in AVS, arguably the last major cardiovascular condition lacking medical therapy for slowing disease progression. With AVS prevalence predicted to dramatically increase (> 300%) by 2050, this remains an urgent unmet clinical need.

Box 1
What is new since the 2010 EAS consensus statement?

Strong evidence for a causal association between Lp(a) concentration and cardiovascular outcomes in different ethnicities.
This association is continuous even at low levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol.
Lp(a) is a new risk factor for aortic valve stenosis.
Evidence does not support Lp(a) as a risk factor for venous thromboembolism and impaired fibrinolysis.
Lifelong very low Lp(a) concentrations may associate with diabetes mellitus.
Lp(a) should be measured at least once in adults.
A high Lp(a) concentration should be interpreted in the context of other risk factors and absolute global cardiovascular risk, and addressed through intensified lifestyle and risk factor management.
Specific effective Lp(a)-lowering therapies are in Phase II/III clinical trials.

Despite affecting ≈1.4 billion people worldwide, the contribution of elevated Lp(a) concentration to cardiovascular risk remains underappreciated. This second EAS statement highlights new evidence for Lp(a), identifies gaps requiring further study, and provides clinical guidance for testing and treating elevated Lp(a) levels. This statement should catalyze global action to improve the management of Lp(a).

### Lipoprotein (a): new insights into mechanisms of atherogenesis and thrombosis [^113rACQF]. Clinical Cardiology (2004). Low credibility.

Lipoprotein(a) (Lp[a]) continues to be a controversial molecule regarding its role in human vascular disease. Although the physiologic role of this molecule is still unclear, novel discoveries within the last few years have suggested numerous mechanisms whereby Lp(a) may contribute to atherosclerosis and its complications in human subjects. These effects may differentially occur in vascular tissue and circulating blood compartments. A complex interplay between tissue-specific effects is probably more relevant to the pathogenicity of this molecule than one single effect alone. This review briefly describes the structure of Lp(a) in relation to its biochemical function, summarizing the current literature on various pathophysiologic mechanisms of Lp(a)-induced vascular disease and the role of cell and tissue-specific effects in promoting atherogenesis and thrombosis.

### Lipoprotein (a) and ethnicities [^113cfHjU]. Atherosclerosis (2022). Medium credibility.

The initial studies focusing on lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] and its role in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease were conducted exclusively in Whites. Subsequently, multiple large-scale, independent investigations have established clear race/ethnic differences in plasma Lp(a) concentration and population distribution over the last four decades. Blacks have the highest Lp(a) level of all race/ethnic groups studied followed by South Asians, Whites, Hispanics and East Asians. The mechanisms underlying these differences have been sought and genetics plays an important role in providing insights into the observed differences. The association of elevated Lp(a) level with cardiovascular disease risk in different race/ethnic groups has also been studied. These studies show that, in general, elevated Lp(a) level is associated with cardiovascular risk in all groups. However, given race/ethnic differences in Lp(a) level and distribution, finding an appropriate Lp(a) threshold that predicts risk, meaningfully categorizes risk among individuals, and guides preventive therapy use has been challenging. In this review, we discuss the available evidence regarding race/ethnic differences in Lp(a) and the underlying mechanisms. Additionally, the association of Lp(a) with cardiovascular risk in various race/ethnic groups and the nuances of identifying the appropriate Lp(a) threshold are discussed. The key points on Lp(a) and ethnicities are described in Box 1.

### Lipoprotein (a): an update on a marker of residual risk and associated clinical manifestations [^116je2h3]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Lipoprotein (a) [Lp(a)] is a low-density, cholesterol-containing lipoprotein that differs from other low-density lipoproteins due to the presence of apolipoprotein(a) bound to its surface apolipoprotein B100. Multiple epidemiologic studies, including Mendelian Randomization studies, have demonstrated that increasing Lp(a) levels are associated with increased risk of heart disease, including atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and calcific aortic stenosis. The risk associated with elevations in Lp(a) appears to be independent of other lipid markers. While the current treatment options for elevated Lp(a) are limited, promising new therapies are under development, leading to renewed interest in Lp(a). This review provides an overview of the biology and epidemiology of Lp(a), available outcome studies, and insights into future therapies.

### A focused update to the 2019 NLA scientific statement on use of lipoprotein (a) in clinical practice [^116KfGVL]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2024). High credibility.

Lipoprotein(a) (Lp[a]) in adult cardiovascular risk assessment — Lp(a) level should be measured at least once in all adults to identify individuals with high Lp(a) levels for implementation of early and intensive risk factor management. For CVD risk assessment, Lp(a) levels should be used to stratify patients as low risk (< 75 nmol/L) or high risk (≥ 125 nmol/L), and individuals with Lp(a) levels in between should be considered as intermediate risk and also may be considered for repeat measurement. As a risk-enhancing factor, Lp(a) level can also help reclassify individuals with overall borderline, intermediate, or high risk, and this information may impact the choice of lifestyle modification and intensification of lipid-lowering therapy with statin and other drugs, including PCSK9 inhibitors. In addition, identification of individuals with high levels of Lp(a) also identifies a family at risk, and cascade screening for elevated Lp(a) should be performed in first-degree family members. Lipoprotein apheresis is indicated for patients with clinically diagnosed FH and either documented coronary artery disease or documented peripheral artery disease whose Lp(a) level remains ≥ 60 mg/dL (∼150 nmol/L) and LDL-C ≥ 100 mg/dL despite maximally tolerated lipid-lowering therapy.

### A focused update to the 2019 NLA scientific statement on use of lipoprotein (a) in clinical practice [^1113qn5U]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2024). High credibility.

NLA focused update — Lp(a) recommendations and thresholds for assessment and therapy: Adults (aged ≥ 18 y) measurement of lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)) in all adults is reasonable to refine atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk assessment (COR I, LOE B-NR). For ASCVD risk stratification, it is reasonable to use Lp(a) thresholds of ≥ 125 nmol/L (≥ 50 mg/dL) for high risk, < 75 nmol/L (< 30 mg/dL) for low risk, and values between as intermediate risk (COR IIa, LOE B-NR). The use of an adjustment factor to estimate Lp(a)-cholesterol (Lp(a)-C) for correction of calculated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) is not recommended (COR III [no benefit], LOE C-EO), and because accepted conversion factors to adjust for Lp(a)-C in LDL-C calculation have proven inaccurate, such adjustments should not be used. Lipoprotein apheresis is an FDA-approved therapy for high-risk patients with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) and ASCVD whose Lp(a) remains ≥ 60 mg/dL (~150 nmol/L) and LDL-C ≥ 100 mg/dL on maximally tolerated lipid-lowering therapy (COR IIa, LOE B-NR), and lipoprotein apheresis is the first therapy to receive a FDA indication for Lp(a) reduction.

Desirable levels

Scientific and clinical evidence favouring an interpretation of causality between elevated levels of a lipoprotein and increased CVD risk constitutes a pre-requisite for selection of desirable levels. For an interpretation of causality, five types of evidence should each favour causality and all three types of human evidence (epidemiology, genetics, and intervention trials) must concur (Table 1). For elevated LDL cholesterol levels, all five criteria are well documented and the consensus is causality. On the basis of the same criteria, elevated Lp(a) levels probably are also causally related to increased CVD risk (Table 1).

Recommendations proposing desirable levels should preferably be based on evidence from a meta-analysis of randomized, controlled intervention trials documenting benefit of treatment (level Ia evidence). Desirable levels for LDL cholesterol levels are based on such evidence from statin trials (Table 2). For Lp(a), the evidence is less clear; however, a meta-analysis of randomized, controlled intervention trials documenting benefit of niacin (= nicotinic acid) treatment has recently been published(see below).

Table 2
Desirable levels for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and lipoprotein(a) levels in the fasting or non-fasting state

For reduction of plasma Lp(a) as a secondary priority after reduction in LDL and total cholesterol levels, we recommend a desirable level below the 80th percentile (less than ∼50 mg/dL; Table 2). As for LDL reduction, treatment of high Lp(a) levels in persons without CVD/CHD or diabetes is recommended for those with intermediate or high absolute risk of CVD/CHD (see Graham et al. and Grundy et al. and Figure 3 in Kamstrup et al.).

If statin treatment in a person with Lp(a) > 50 mg/dl, but without CVD or diabetes, reduces absolute risk for fatal CVD to < 3% or for fatal and/or non-fatal CHD to < 10%, there might be no need for further treatment with niacin; however, in those with premature CVD, familial hypercholesterolaemia, a family history of premature CVD and elevated Lp(a), or recurrent CVD despite statin treatment, niacin may still be justified despite aggressive LDL cholesterol reduction with a statin.

3.2 Identifying high‐risk groups for Lp(a) testing

While universal testing may be ideal, targeted testing remains a pragmatic approach in most clinical settings. The following groups should be prioritised for Lp(a) measurement (Table 1):
Individuals with premature ASCVD. Premature ASCVD, defined as cardiovascular events occurring before age 55 years in men and 65 years in women, points to possible underlying genetic contributors, including elevated Lp(a). In these individuals, Lp(a) measurement may uncover a risk factor that may not be addressed by standard lipid‐lowering therapies alone.
Family history of premature ASCVD or elevated Lp(a). Given the strong heritability of Lp(a) levels, first‐degree relatives of individuals with premature ASCVD or elevated Lp(a) should undergo testing. Cascade screening in such families can identify at‐risk individuals before the onset of clinical disease, allowing for early intervention.
Recurrent ASCVD despite optimal LDL‐lowering therapy. Patients with less than expected response to statins or who continue to experience cardiovascular events despite achieving low‐density lipoprotein‐cholesterol (LDL‐C) targets may have residual risk driven by elevated Lp(a). In such cases, Lp(a) measurement can inform the need for more aggressive secondary preventive strategies.
Patients with suspected or confirmed familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH). Lp(a) elevation is common among individuals with FH and may contribute to the observed variability in cardiovascular risk within this group. Identifying elevated Lp(a) in these patients can help stratify risk and tailor management strategies.
Individuals of African and South Asian ancestry. Evidence consistently demonstrates that individuals of African descent have the highest median Lp(a) levels, followed by South Asians. Despite this, awareness and testing rates remain disproportionately low in these groups. Given the increased cardiovascular risk conferred by elevated Lp(a), routine screening should be considered, particularly among those with other risk factors or a family history of ASCVD.
Patients with CAVD. Lp(a) has emerged as a causal factor in the development of CAVD, independent of traditional cardiovascular risk factors. In patients presenting with CAVD, especially at a young age or without significant atherosclerotic burden, Lp(a) testing can provide insights into disease aetiology and may inform the intensity of surveillance and management strategies.
Patients with advanced subclinical atherosclerosis or enriched in ASCVD risk factors. Prior observational studies demonstrate individuals with coronary artery calcium ≥ 300 experience a risk similar to that of individuals with prior myocardial infarction or stroke; therefore, identification of individuals with advanced subclinical atherosclerosis with elevated Lp(a) may facilitate earlier prevention efforts. Additionally, there is evidence that Lp(a) may interact with several traditional risk factors, including diabetesand hypertension, to enhance ASCVD risk; however, this is an active area of ongoing research.
High‐risk individuals < 18 years old. Selective Lp(a) testing is recommended for children with clinically suspected or genetically confirmed familial hypercholesterolaemia, ischaemic stroke of undetermined aetiology, first‐degree relatives with a history of premature ASCVD or first‐degree relatives with elevated Lp(a). However, clinicians should acknowledge that Lp(a) levels may not fully stabilise until late teenage years and there is considerable variability in Lp(a) levels among youth, as intraindividual variation may be as high as 70%. Thus, repeat Lp(a) testing may be considered among high‐risk individuals < 18 years old, especially if initially measured during early childhood.

Genetic determinants of lipoprotein(a) levels are summarized in Figure 3. As discussed above, there is marked variation in measured plasma lipoprotein(a) across individuals from different racial and ethnic backgrounds, which can be explained largely by genetic variants within the LPA gene locus.

### Lipoprotein (a) as a potential causal genetic risk factor of cardiovascular disease: a rationale for increased efforts to understand its pathophysiology and develop targeted therapies [^112biF27]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2012). Low credibility.

Recent published studies have provided increasing evidence that lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] may be a potential causal, genetic, independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Lp(a) levels > 25 mg/dl are present in ∼30% of Caucasians and 60% to 70% of Blacks. Lp(a) is composed of apolipoprotein B-100 and apolipoprotein (a) [(apo(a)]. Circulating Lp(a) levels are primarily influenced by the LPA gene without significant dietary or environmental effects, mediating CVD risk throughout the patient's lifetime. Recent clinical outcomes studies, meta-analyses, and Mendelian randomization studies, in which randomization of Lp(a) levels is achieved through the random assortment of LPA gene variants thereby removing confounders, have shown that genetically determined Lp(a) levels are continuously and linearly related to risk of CVD. Currently, Lp(a) pathophysiology is not fully understood, and specifically targeted therapies to lower Lp(a) are not available. We provide a rationale for increased basic and clinical investigational efforts to further understand Lp(a) pathophysiology and assess whether reducing Lp(a) levels minimizes CVD risk. First, a detailed understanding of Lp(a) synthesis and clearance has not been realized. Second, several mechanisms of atherogenicity are known to varying extent, but the relative contributions of each are not known. Lp(a) may be atherothrombotic through its low-density lipoprotein moiety, but also through apo(a), including its ability to be retained in the vessel wall and mediate pro-inflammatory and proapoptotic effects including those potentiated by its content of oxidized phospholipids, and antifibrinolytic effects. Finally, development of specific Lp(a)-lowering agents to potently lower Lp(a) will allow testing of mechanistic hypotheses in animal models and the design of randomized clinical trials to assess reduction in CVD. A convergence of academic, scientific, pharmaceutical, and National Institutes of Health priorities and efforts can make this a reality in the next decade.

### Assessing the accuracy of estimated lipoprotein (a) cholesterol and lipoprotein (a)-free low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [^116uzFMy]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Advancements in risk assessment, diagnosis, and treatment response to current and future therapies have increased the impetus for accurate measurement of the atherogenic burden of Lp(a). Currently, the reporting of Lp(a) levels varies substantially. The International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine recommends Lp(a) particle number (Lp[a]‐P), an assessment of molar concentration, as the clinical standard for assessing Lp(a). However, in contemporary clinical cohorts, Lp(a) levels have often been expressed in mass concentration (mg/dL) of the entire lipoprotein particles (eg, cholesterol, esters, phospholipids, triglycerides, and apolipoproteins) to allow familiarity in evaluating cardiovascular risk.

A proposed method for estimation of Lp(a) cholesterol (Lp[a]‐C) has emerged by dividing Lp(a)‐P (in nmol/L) by a conversion factor of 2.4 to reflect mass in mg/dL and then multiplying by 30% to reflect the cholesterol content of Lp(a). This method is of clinical interest since the calculated LDL‐C value on a standard lipid panel contains Lp(a)‐C. As such, the ability to express Lp(a)‐C as a measure of cholesterol content within Lp(a) particles may be appealing to clinicians. Comparing Lp(a)‐C with LDL‐C would provide clinicians with a qualitative understanding of the degree to which Lp(a) is contributing to the underlying atherosclerotic disease process. Moreover, assessing Lp(a)‐C might help to explain situations wherein LDL‐C reduction is less than anticipated with LDL‐targeted therapies such as statins. There is evidence that statins, by far the most used lipid‐lowering therapy, do not lower Lp(a) and in some cases may modestly increase Lp(a) levels. Since Lp(a)‐C is a component of LDL‐C, individuals with high Lp(a)‐C levels therefore may have a less‐than‐expected response to statin therapy. There has also been interest in using Lp(a)‐C to isolate the Lp(a)‐free LDL‐C component, allowing clinicians to arrive at a closer estimation of what is the "real" amount of circulating LDL‐C. Because society guidelines employ clinical rather than real LDL‐C to guide lipid therapy, we do not advocate for the use of LDL‐C correction for Lp(a)‐C. However, if inappropriately applied in this way to guide treatment decisions based on established LDL‐C targets, the perils of estimated Lp(a)‐C inaccuracies may be further amplified.

### What do we know about the role of lipoprotein (a) in atherogenesis 57 years after its discovery? [^113Bp7wB]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Elevated circulating concentrations of lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] is strongly associated with increased risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD) and degenerative aortic stenosis. This relationship was first observed in prospective observational studies, and the causal relationship was confirmed in genetic studies. Everybody should have their Lp(a) concentration measured once in their lifetime. CVD risk is elevated when Lp(a) concentrations are high i.e. > 50 mg/dL (≥ 100 mmol/L). Extremely high Lp(a) levels > 180 mg/dL (≥ 430 mmol/L) are associated with CVD risk similar to that conferred by familial hypercholesterolemia. Elevated Lp(a) level was previously treated with niacin, which exerts a potent Lp(a)-lowering effect. However, niacin is currently not recommended because, despite the improvement in lipid profile, no improvements on clinical outcomes have been observed. Furthermore, niacin use has been associated with severe adverse effects. Post hoc analyses of clinical trials with proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type-9 (PCSK9) inhibitors have shown that these drugs exert clinical benefits by lowering Lp(a), independent of their potent reduction of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). It is not yet known whether PCSK9 inhibitors will be of clinical use in patients with elevated Lp(a). Apheresis is a very effective approach to Lp(a) reduction, which reduces CVD risk but is invasive and time-consuming and is thus reserved for patients with very high Lp(a) levels and progressive CVD. Studies are ongoing on the practical application of genetic approaches to therapy, including antisense oligonucleotides against apolipoprotein(a) and small interfering RNA (siRNA) technology, to reduce the synthesis of Lp(a).

### A focused update to the 2019 NLA scientific statement on use of lipoprotein (a) in clinical practice [^1163C7X8]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2024). High credibility.

NLA focused update — Lp(a) screening and risk across populations: We recommend measuring Lp(a) in every adult at least once for cardiovascular risk assessment (see Table 1; COR I, LOE B-NR). The risk for ASCVD events that is associated with Lp(a) is independent of LDL-C and is attributed to the atherogenic, proinflammatory, and prothrombotic properties of Lp(a), and Lp(a) is associated with an increased risk of incident ASCVD even in the absence of a family history of heart disease. Systematic universal Lp(a) screening can improve health outcomes by increasing awareness of, and enabling precision in, ASCVD prevention strategies and individualization of therapy selection. Elevated Lp(a) remains a risk factor for ASCVD even with aggressive LDL-C lowering by statins and nonstatins (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 [PCSK9] inhibitors, bempedoic acid, and ezetimibe), and early, and more-intensive management of modifiable risk factors, including LDL-C and non–high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) levels, is warranted in at-risk patients who have elevated Lp(a). This update also notes that elevated Lp(a) is not a risk factor for venous thromboembolism and that in the pediatric population (children < 18 years of age) elevation of Lp(a) has been linked to the occurrence of arterial ischemic stroke.

### Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol corrected for lipoprotein (a) cholesterol, risk thresholds, and cardiovascular events [^116er2xS]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

It is important to clarify that Lp(a)‐C risk is not equivalent to lipoprotein(a) mass/molar concentration mediated risk, because lipoprotein(a) additionally contains the apolipoprotein B‐100 component, the potentially thrombogenic apolipoprotein(a) peptide, as well as proinflammatory oxidized phospholipids that are significantly overrepresented on lipoprotein(a) versus LDL particles. 38, 39 These factors may additionally contribute to risk that is not reflected in its cholesterol content. In fact, lipoprotein(a) mass has been shown to be more predictive than Lp(a)‐C when measured in the same patients. 10

The primary objective of this study was to estimate the clinical impact of Lp(a)‐C's contribution to what is measured as "LDL‐C" and raise awareness to this highly underappreciated caveat of the "LDL‐C" biomarker. This study, in isolation, was not intended to provide guidance on clinical practice, but rather to demonstrate the clinical need for accurately defining the contribution of true LDL versus lipoprotein(a) toward the risk attributed to what is currently measured and reported as LDL‐C.

TABLE 2
Major societal guideline lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] thresholds.

Risk assessment and management of individuals with elevated Lp(a) are actionable. Individuals with elevated Lp(a) may benefit from additional risk assessment, including a detailed family history and selective use of subclinical atherosclerosis imaging. Family history of CHD in a first‐degree relative (17%) and elevated Lp(a) (25%) are independently associated with an increased risk of incident ASCVD over 20‐year follow‐up, and those with a concurrent family history of CHD and elevated Lp(a) experience the highest risk (43%). Therefore, risk attributable to family history of CHD and elevated Lp(a) appears to be additive, and clinicians should strive to assess such risk, especially among those with elevated Lp(a). These efforts may also facilitate cascade screening. In addition to family history, measurement of subclinical atherosclerosis burden may be helpful to guide risk assessment among individuals with elevated Lp(a) who do not have clinical ASCVD (Figure 2). Among individuals without prior myocardial infarction or stroke, measurement of coronary artery calcium (CAC) provides further granularity to understanding risk for those with elevated Lp(a), as CAC and Lp(a) are independently associated with ASCVD. Compared to persons without elevated Lp(a) and absence of CAC, Lp(a) ≥ 50 mg/dL is associated with a 29% higher risk of ASCVD, whereas CAC 1‐99 Agatston Units (AU) and ≥ 100 AU are associated with a 68% and 2.7‐fold higher ASCVD risk, respectively. When assessed concurrently, there is a 4.7‐fold higher risk of ASCVD for individuals with Lp(a) ≥ 50 mg/dL and CAC ≥ 100. While there is an observed 31% higher ASCVD risk for those with Lp(a) ≥ 50 mg/dL and CAC = 0, this risk is not significant after adjusting for traditional risk factors and is considerably lower when compared to those with higher CAC burden. However, given the older average age of individuals and inclusion criteria based upon the absence of clinical ASCVD for these population‐based studies, it is possible that individuals with elevated Lp(a) and premature ASCVD events were excluded from this analysis. Thus, measurement of CAC may help personalise risk assessment for individuals with elevated Lp(a) and guide discussions involving lifestyle management as well as the initiation of preventive pharmacotherapies, including statin and aspirin. Further research is needed to understand risk assessment and personalise shared decision‐making involving therapies for individuals with elevated Lp(a) and absence of CAC.

4.1 Cardiovascular risk assessment

There is a stepwise higher risk of ASCVD and CAVD across increasing Lp(a) levelswith about a 40% higher risk of ASCVD per 50 mg/dL increase in Lp(a). Similarly, an approximate 82% higher risk for incident aortic valve calcium (AVC) begins as low as 18 mg/dL Lp(a). The commonly used threshold for elevated Lp(a) level internationally is ≥ 50 mg/dL or ≥ 125 nmol/L (Table 2). In 2024, the U.S. National Lipid Association introduced a gradation of risk across Lp(a), defining individuals with low (< 30 mg/dL or < 75 nmol/L), intermediate (30–49 mg/dL or 75–124 nmol/L) and high (≥ 50 mg/dL or ≥ 125 nmol/L) risk. The European Society of Cardiology and European Atherosclerosis Society define very‐high Lp(a) level at a threshold of ≥ 180 mg/dL or 430 nmol/L, which corresponds to the 99th percentile and risk similar to that of familial hypercholesterolaemia.

recurrent CVD despite statin treatment,
≥ 3% 10-year risk of fatal CVD according to the European guidelines, and

Repeat measurement is only necessary if treatment for high Lp(a) levels is initiated in order to evaluate therapeutic response.

### Lipoprotein (a): the revenant [^1125w1jf]. European Heart Journal (2017). Low credibility.

In the mid-1990s, the days of lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] were numbered and many people would not have placed a bet on this lipid particle making it to the next century. However, genetic studies brought Lp(a) back to the front-stage after a Mendelian randomization approach used for the first time provided strong support for a causal role of high Lp(a) concentrations in cardiovascular disease and later also for aortic valve stenosis. This encouraged the use of therapeutic interventions to lower Lp(a) as well numerous drug developments, although these approaches mainly targeted LDL cholesterol, while the Lp(a)-lowering effect was only a 'side-effect'. Several drug developments did show a potent Lp(a)-lowering effect but did not make it to endpoint studies, mainly for safety reasons. Currently, three therapeutic approaches are either already in place or look highly promising: (i) lipid apheresis (specific or unspecific for Lp(a)) markedly decreases Lp(a) concentrations as well as cardiovascular endpoints; (ii) PCSK9 inhibitors which, besides lowering LDL cholesterol also decrease Lp(a) by roughly 30%; and (iii) antisense therapy targeting apolipoprotein(a) which has shown to specifically lower Lp(a) concentrations by up to 90% in phase 1 and 2 trials without influencing other lipids. Until the results of phase 3 outcome studies are available for antisense therapy, we will have to exercise patience, but with optimism since never before have we had the tools we have now to prove Koch's extrapolated postulate that lowering high Lp(a) concentrations might be protective against cardiovascular disease.

### Lipoprotein (a) in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and aortic stenosis: a European Atherosclerosis Society consensus statement [^11684Je3]. European Heart Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Clinical guidance: What to do with the patient with high Lp(a)?

In the absence of approved specific Lp(a)-lowering drugs, this panel recommends early, intensive management of other risk factors for individuals with elevated Lp(a) levels, consistent with most guidelines. Personalized management of LDL-C, blood pressure, glucose, and lifestyle factors, taking into account baseline cardiovascular risk and the untreated Lp(a) level, is recommended to reduce ASCVD risk sufficiently to mitigate increased risk caused by an elevated Lp(a) level (Figure 6B).

LDL-C management should be in accordance with current guidelines. Although statins may slightly increase Lp(a) levels, treatment should not be discontinued as the cardiovascular benefits in patients with high Lp(a) far outweigh any potential risk associated with modest increases in Lp(a) levels. Lipoprotein apheresis can be considered in patients with very high Lp(a) and progressive ASCVD despite optimal treatment of other risk factors as uncontrolled data indicate benefit.

In major studies with PCSK9 inhibitors, the absolute cardiovascular risk reduction with this treatment was higher at higher baseline Lp(a) levels. In FOURIER, the absolute risk reduction was 2.41% vs. 1.41% with an Lp(a) > 50 vs. < 50 mg/dLand in ODYSSEY OUTCOMES, 3.7% at Lp(a) > 60 mg/dL vs. 0.5% in the lowest Lp(a) quartile. However, PCSK9 inhibitors are not registered for Lp(a) lowering.

Niacin is not recommended given the lack of clinical benefit in two outcomes studies. Current data also do not support targeting aspirin use based on Lp(a) levels. Whether aspirin might be beneficial among individuals with markedly elevated Lp(a) is uncertain (see Supplementary material online).

Lp(a) measurement and units — Apolipoprotein(a) (apo(a)) has kringle IV type 2 (KIV2) sequences ranging from 3 to > 40 copies that yield differently sized isoforms, and antibodies recognizing KIV2 epitopes tend to underestimate smaller Lp(a) isoforms and overestimate larger ones, challenging standardization. Regarding units, reporting particle concentration (nmol/L) versus mass concentration (mg/dL) remains controversial; the NLA continues to favor Lp(a) measurement in nmol/L, but measurement in mg/dL is far better than no measurement and should be used if only a mass assay is available, and the NLA strongly recommends against converting between mg/dL and nmol/L using a fixed conversion factor (COR III [no benefit], LOE C-EO). Interim standardization efforts note that many analytical methods, many of which use a 5-point calibrator, are sufficient to assess risk associated with Lp(a) in the general population.

Elevated lipoprotein(a) as a causal cardiovascular risk — population-based evidence indicates that accumulating data from large, population-based studies identify elevated plasma Lp(a) as an important independent, causal risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and calcific aortic valve stenosis. In two UK Biobank analyses with enormous sample sizes (460,506 and 413,734), a continuous, log-linear relationship was observed with a significant increase in risk even at "low-risk" levels of 25–50 nmol/L. This supports retiring a dichotomous threshold of 125 nmol/L or 50 mg/dL. ASCVD risk attributable to elevated Lp(a) was similar for White, South Asian, and Black individuals (hazard ratios [HRs] 1.11, 1.20, and 1.07 per 50-nmol/L increase), with no impact of race on Lp(a)-attributable risk and no evidence for race-based definitions of elevated Lp(a). A large multiethnic US pooled cohort showed consistent increases by sex and race/ethnicity, with particularly stronger relationships noted in individuals with versus without diabetes.

Conclusions

The key points and take‐home messages from this article are summarized in Video S1. In summary, lipoprotein(a) is a unique lipoprotein with multiple structural features that give rise to a vast array of potential pathogenic effects, likely contributing to the development of CVD. A clear understanding of the association between elevated lipoprotein(a) and CVD risk is compounded by the fact that lipoprotein(a) is subject to complex genetic regulation that differs between racial and ethnic populations. It should be noted that much of the data pertaining to the regulation of the LPA gene has been generated in White populations. Thus, more data are required for other populations, particularly for Black individuals who have higher median lipoprotein(a) levels compared with individuals from different racial and ethnic backgrounds.

While we await the results of ongoing clinical trials of investigational lipoprotein(a)‐lowering therapies, healthcare professionals must recognize elevated lipoprotein(a) as a CVD risk factor and advocate for its routine testing in clinical practice. Lipoprotein(a) testing can facilitate intensive risk factor management and reclassification of ASCVD risk in patients found to have elevated lipoprotein(a). Routine testing may also help identify patients who are potentially eligible for treatment with investigational lipoprotein(a)‐lowering therapies, should these therapies become available in the future. Clinical trials are ongoing to clarify whether investigational therapies that lower lipoprotein(a) will lead to clinically meaningful reductions in the occurrence of cardiovascular events.

Take‑home points for Lp(a) risk and measurement — The relationship between Lp(a) level and cardiovascular disease risk is continuous and log-linear, and rather than a single dichotomous cutoff, Lp(a) levels represent a continuum of risk; individuals with Lp(a) levels < 75 nmol/L (30 mg/dL) may be considered low risk, individuals with Lp(a) levels ≥ 125 nmol/L (50 mg/dL) may be considered high risk, and those in the "gray zone" 75 to 125 nmol/L (30–50 mg/dL) are at intermediate risk and may warrant repeat measurement; Lp(a) risk categories apply across races and ethnicities, Lp(a) should be measured at least once in every adult for cardiovascular risk assessment, should be reported in nmol/L with no conversion between mg/dL and nmol/L using a fixed factor, the previously proposed correction factor for Lp(a)-C used to adjust LDL-C calculation should not be used, concerns about Lp(a) elevation should not be a reason to discourage or discontinue a statin, and in high-risk patients with elevated Lp(a) who need additional LDL-C lowering after maximally tolerated statin therapy, a PCSK9 inhibitor may address residual risk from both LDL-C and Lp(a).

### Lipoprotein (a) measurement issues: are we making a mountain out of a molehill? [^115wj1rh]. Atherosclerosis (2022). Medium credibility.

Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] became besides LDL cholesterol one of the most attractive targets for intervention in cardiovascular disease. Strong genetic evidence supports the causal association between high Lp(a) concentrations and cardiovascular outcomes. Since specific Lp(a)-lowering therapies are under clinical investigation, the interest in measuring Lp(a) has markedly increased. However, the special structure of the lead protein component of Lp(a), named apolipoprotein(a), creates difficulties for an accurate measurement of Lp(a). A highly homologous repetitive structure, called kringle IV repeat with up to more the 40 repeats, causes a highly polymorphic protein. Antibodies raised against apolipoprotein(a) are mostly directed against the repetitive structure of this protein, which complicates the measurement of Lp(a) in molar terms. Both measurements in mass (mg/dL) and molar terms (nmol/L) are described and a conversion from one into the another unit is only approximately possible. Working groups for standardization of Lp(a) measurements are going to prepare widely available and improved reference materials, which will be a major step for the measurement of Lp(a). This review discusses many aspects of the difficulties in measuring Lp(a). It tries to distinguish between academic and practical concerns and warns to make a mountain out of a molehill, which does no longer allow to see the patient behind that mountain by simply staring at the laboratory issues. On the other hand, the calibration of some assays raises major concerns, which are anything else but a molehill. This should be kept in mind and we should start measuring Lp(a) with the aim of a better risk stratification for the patient and to identify those patients who might be in urgent need for a specific Lp(a)-lowering therapy as soon as it becomes available.

1 INTRODUCTION

Over the last four decades, numerous studies have demonstrated that elevated lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)) is an independent risk factor for coronary heart disease, ischemic stroke, and calcific aortic valve stenosis. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 With a unique molecular structure hypothesized to be both pro‐atherogenic and pro‐thrombotic, 13 Lp(a) is composed of a low‐density lipoprotein‐like moiety covalently bound to a genetically‐mediated apolipoprotein(a) molecule. 14 Synthesized in the liver and mediated almost entirely by the LPA gene, elevated Lp(a) is the most common inherited dyslipidemia, affecting approximately one in five individuals. 15 Lp(a) levels above 50 mg/dL (≈ 125 nmol/L) correspond to the 80th percentile in population‐based studies and is the threshold at which its impact on atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) has been shown to become clinically meaningful. 10, 16, 17 Even for individuals with otherwise well‐controlled risk factors, elevated levels of Lp(a) have a significant and independent effect on residual atherosclerotic cardiovascular risk. 18

Despite the robust evidence linking elevated levels of Lp(a) to cardiovascular disease, there are currently no approved pharmacologic therapies directly targeting Lp(a). Presently, those with significantly elevated levels are counseled on overall risk reduction and — in certain scenarios — recommended to initiate statin therapy. 19, 20, 21 While statin therapy has no direct effect on Lp(a) levels, 22 its use in some individuals with elevated Lp(a) centers around overall ASCVD risk reduction. However, there are now a variety of promising therapeutics in development which may transform the management of this dyslipidemia and help mitigate this important cardiovascular risk factor. 12, 23, 24, 25, 26

With the landscape of Lp(a) management potentially shifting in the coming decade, there is a need to develop a deeper understanding as to which subsets of patients may derive the most benefit from future targeted therapies. Accordingly, we set out to assess the demographics, clinical characteristics, and outcomes of a large cohort of patients (n ≈ 30 000) who have had their Lp(a) measured over the last 20 years to further understand the association between Lp(a) levels and cardiovascular disease.

To address this issue, isoform‐insensitive assays have been developed, though there is no fully isoform‐independent commercial assay. These assays employ antibodies that target apo(a) epitopes not affected by KIV‐2 repeat variations, thus providing more accurate and consistent measurements. The World Health Organization (WHO) and the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry (IFCC) have established a reference material (WHO/IFCC SRM 2B) and recommend the use of isoform‐insensitive assays standardised against this reference. The variability in methodologies underscores the need for widespread adoption of standardised isoform‐insensitive assays and the development of a reference isoform‐insensitive assay.

Furthermore, interpreting Lp(a) levels requires an understanding of the units used in reporting. Lp(a) concentrations are reported in either mass units (mg/dL) or molar units (nmol/L). Mass units reflect the total mass of Lp(a) particles, including cholesterol, triglycerides, phospholipids and apo(a), whereas molar units reflect the number of Lp(a) particles. Because cardiovascular risk correlates more closely with Lp(a) particle number rather than mass, nmol/L is considered the preferred unit for clinical reporting. However, a major barrier to harmonisation is the lack of a uniform conversion factor between mg/dL and nmol/L. The molecular weight of Lp(a) varies significantly depending on apo(a) isoform size, preventing a fixed conversion factor. This variability complicates the interpretation of Lp(a) levels when switching between units, particularly when applying guideline‐recommended thresholds derived from studies using different measurement units. Given these discrepancies, adoption of nmol/L as the standard reporting unit, in line with recommendations from international organisations, would enable more precise risk assessment and consistent application of evidence‐based thresholds. However, the prognostic utility of different assays is similar and discrepancies in measurement between mass versus particle‐based measurement are most relevant at the extremes of Lp(a) values.

### Lipoprotein (a) as a cardiovascular risk factor [^115rm4hY]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] is a class of lipoprotein particles having the lipid composition of plasma low-density lipoprotein (LDL), but with a distinct protein moiety comprised of two proteins linked together by a disulfide bridge. The two proteins are apoB100, the protein moiety of LDL, and apo(a), a heavily glycosylated protein that is specific for Lp(a). Apo(a) has a strong structural similarity to plasminogen and has a wide-size polymorphism that has a genetic origin and is partially responsible for the size and density heterogeneity of Lp(a). High plasma levels of Lp(a) are associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular disease that is related to the atherogenic and thrombogenic potentials of this lipoprotein enhanced by the presence of other risk factors, among which are high plasma levels of LDL or low levels of high-density lipoprotein. The factors determining the plasma levels of Lp(a) have not been clearly identified except for an association with different alleles of the apo(a) gene, which is located in the long arm of chromosome 6. Currently there are no generally accepted ways to normalize the plasma levels of Lp(a) by either dietary and/or pharmacologic means. Until further progress in this area is made, patients with high plasma levels of Lp(a) should be advised to correct modifiable risk factors in order to decrease the cardiovascular pathogenicity of this lipoprotein class.

Genetic risk scores versus measurement for lipoprotein(a) — although genetic risk scores near the LPA locus are increasingly accurate, the Lp(a) genetic risk score appears to add no incremental value for CVD risk classification compared with Lp(a) concentrations alone, and therefore, at this time, Lp(a) measurement is preferable for risk ascertainment, mandating increased screening to identify individuals with elevated Lp(a) and high risk for CVD.

Statins — across guidelines, statins remain first-line therapy for mitigating low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C)–driven atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk; although statins do not lower Lp(a) and may slightly increase it, they reduce major adverse cardiovascular events by "approximately 22% for each 1-mmol/L (38.7 mg/dL) reduction in LDL-C". Median Lp(a) was not affected by rosuvastatin in JUPITER, and on-treatment Lp(a) increases with statins are minimal on average ("approximate 1.1-mg/dL increase or 0.1% relative increase"). Concerns about Lp(a) elevation "should not be a reason to discourage or discontinue statins".

Is there a role for genetic testing?

Measurement of Lp(a) concentration is sufficient for Lp(a)-related risk estimation without the need for genotyping, polygenic risk scores, or investigation of expressed apo(a) isoform sizes.

Consensus panel recommendations for Lp(a) measurement

Laboratories should use an Lp(a) assay that is insensitive to apo(a) isoform and traceable to official reference materials.
Measurement of Lp(a) should be in molar units if available. If not, the units in which the assay is calibrated should be used for reporting.
Rather than absolute values, clinical guidelines should consider using risk thresholds with 'grey' zones (e.g. 30–50 mg/dL or 75–125 nmol/L) to either rule-in (≥ 50 mg/dL; 125 nmol/L) or rule-out (< 30 mg/dL; 75 nmol/L) cardiovascular risk.

### Lp (a) as a risk factor for peripheral artery disease: context is everything [^111hQSz1]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2025). Medium credibility.

Elevated plasma concentrations of Lp(a) (lipoprotein[a]) are an independent and causal risk factor for the development of atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases, including peripheral artery disease (PAD). Although proatherosclerotic, proinflammatory, procalcific, and prothrombotic effects have been attributed to Lp(a), the precise pathogenic mechanisms by which Lp(a) contributes to these disorders are unclear. Moreover, whether Lp(a) contributes in different ways to atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases in different vascular sites has not been explored. In particular, PAD involves atherosclerotic plaque rupture and subsequent thrombosis in vessels above the knee, but medial arterial calcification leading to vessel stiffness and thrombosis below the knee; the significance of Lp(a) in these contexts is unclear. Elevated Lp(a) is associated with the spectrum of PAD outcomes, including incident claudication, PAD progression, lower limb revascularization, restenosis, major adverse leg events, including limb amputation, and death and hospitalization due to PAD. Overall, elevated Lp(a) is as potent a risk factor for PAD as it is for coronary artery disease. Reducing Lp(a) to mitigate risk of PAD and to treat patients with PAD, therefore, remains a substantial unmet clinical need, although studies are underway to assess the efficacy of RNA-directed Lp(a)-lowering therapies in preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease events. Mounting clinical trials of these therapies to specifically address their effect on PAD events is the next key step.

### A focused update to the 2019 NLA scientific statement on use of lipoprotein (a) in clinical practice [^113W5TW1]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2024). High credibility.

Pediatric lipoprotein(a) screening and risk — We recommend selective screening of Lp(a) in high-risk children < 18 years of age, including those with clinically suspected or genetically confirmed familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), first-degree relatives with a history of premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) (age < 55 years in men, < 65 years in women), ischemic stroke of unknown cause, or first-degree relatives with elevated Lp(a); moreover, a finding of elevated Lp(a) in a child should trigger cascade screening of immediate family members. Elevated Lp(a) is associated with ischemic stroke in children (odds ratio 6.3 [95% CI 4.5–8.7] for Lp(a) levels > 30 mg/dL [75 nmol/L]), and individuals with elevated Lp(a) (≥ 30 mg/dL) as children had ~2 times higher risk for ASCVD events as adults, while those with both elevated Lp(a) and LDL-C (≥ 130 mg/dL) as children had ~4 times higher risk; Lp(a) reaches adult levels by age 5 years.

What determines plasma Lp(a) concentration?

Genetics of Lp(a) concentration

Lp(a) concentration ranges between < 0.1 mg/dL and > 300 mg/dL (< 0.2–750 nmol/L) and is predominantly (> 90%) determined by genetic variability at the LPA locus. By age 2 years, the LPA gene is fully expressed; adult Lp(a) levels are usually attained by ∼5 yearsbut may increase until adulthood. The Kringle-IV (K-IV) repeat polymorphism explains ∼30–70% of the variability in concentration (Figure 1). Expression of a low number (< 23) of K-IV repeats is characterized by small apolipoprotein(a) [apo(a)] isoforms and markedly higher Lp(a) concentration compared with those with only large isoforms. However, as levels for a given apo(a) isoform may vary up to 200-fold between unrelated individuals and up to 2.5-fold within families when alleles are identical-by-descent, it is likely that other genetic variants with regulatory effects are also involved (Figure 1).

Lipoprotein(a): Hope on the Horizon

Lipoprotein(a) Lowering

Mendelian randomization studies have estimated that a reduction in lipoprotein(a) levels of > 50 to 100 mg/dL is required for a clinically meaningful reduction in the short‐term risk of ASCVD events (within 5 years). The lipoprotein(a)‐lowering effects of currently available therapies are summarized in Table 3. At present, there are no drugs specifically approved for lipoprotein(a) lowering; however, lipoprotein apheresis can be effective in reducing lipoprotein(a) levels in patients with high lipoprotein(a) (> 120 nmol/L) and progressive ASCVD. While apheresis is associated with meaningful lipoprotein(a)‐lowering effects, it can take up to 3 hours for each treatment to be administered, which may be inconvenient for many patients.

Table 3
Lipoprotein(a)‐Lowering Effects of Currently Available Therapies,

The lipoprotein(a)‐lowering effects of established lipid‐lowering therapies have been studied in clinical trials. However, these studies were not conducted in populations enriched for patients with elevated lipoprotein(a) and were not powered to evaluate the lipoprotein(a)‐lowering effects of these agents. Anti‐proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 monoclonal antibodies demonstrated modest reductions in lipoprotein(a) levels of up to 27%, while data for statins are conflicting, with some evidence suggesting that statins may slightly increase lipoprotein(a) levels. However, a 2022 meta‐analysis concluded that, compared with a placebo, statins do not lead to clinically important reductions in lipoprotein(a) levels in patients at risk for CVD.

### A focused update to the 2019 NLA scientific statement on use of lipoprotein (a) in clinical practice [^114PYx1k]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2024). High credibility.

Lipoprotein(a)-directed treatment actions — In adults aged 40–75 y with a 10-y ASCVD risk of 7.5%–19.9%, the finding of an Lp(a) ≥ 125 nmol/L or ≥ 50 mg/dL is reasonable to be used as a risk-enhancing factor to favor initiation of a moderate- or high-intensity statin. In high-risk or very-high-risk patients with Lp(a) ≥ 125 nmol/L or ≥ 50 mg/dL, it is reasonable to consider more intensive low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) lowering to achieve greater ASCVD risk reduction. In high-risk or very-high-risk patients taking a maximally tolerated statin with Lp(a) ≥ 125 nmol/L or ≥ 50 mg/dL, the addition of ezetimibe is reasonable in those with on-treatment LDL-C ≥ 70 mg/dL (or non-HDL-C ≥ 100 mg/dL), and the addition of a PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9) inhibitor is reasonable in those with on-treatment LDL-C ≥ 70 mg/dL (or non-HDL-C ≥ 100 mg/dL). Lipoprotein apheresis is reasonable for high-risk patients with FH and ASCVD whose Lp(a) level remains ≥ 60 mg/dL (∼150 nmol/L) and LDL-C ≥ 100 mg/dL on maximally tolerated lipid-lowering therapy, and niacin or hormone-replacement therapy (HRT) with estrogen and progesterone, which lower Lp(a), is not recommended to reduce ASCVD risk.

Risk stratification thresholds and repeat testing for lipoprotein(a) — individuals with Lp(a) levels < 75 nmol/L (30 mg/dL) can be considered low risk and those with Lp(a) levels ≥ 125 nmol/L (50 mg/dL) should be considered high risk (COR IIa, LOE B-R), with a gray zone for repeat measurement between 75 and 125 nmol/L (30–50 mg/dL). Because levels are relatively stable in primary prevention, measurement of Lp(a) once for low- or high-risk categories is reasonable, while repeat measurement may be warranted for intermediate-risk patients such as women after menopause, those who develop proteinuria and chronic kidney disease, or those with hypothyroidism; the prior NLA approach was dichotomous at ≥ 100 nmol/L in White patients.

4.3 Reduction ofrisk not attributable to Lp(a)

Though elevated Lp(a) is an inherited ASCVD risk factor, initial discussions should involve assessment of lifestyle and traditional risk factor control (Table 3). There have been studies in two independent cohorts (EPIC‐Norfolkand Multiethnic Study of Atherosclerosis) evaluating the role of ideal cardiovascular health across Lp(a) levels. As a part of efforts to promote and measure ideal cardiovascular health, the Life's Simple 7 score was introduced by the American Heart Association in 2010 and includes a summed score of 0 (poor), 1 (average) or 2 (ideal) across seven metrics: body mass index, cholesterol, systolic blood pressure, glycated haemoglobin, smoking status, physical activity and diet. Individuals with intermediate and elevated Lp(a) who achieve higher Life's Simple 7 scores have a lower risk of ASCVD, independent of statin and aspirin therapy. The magnitude of relative risk reduction in ASCVD among individuals with elevated Lp(a) who achieve ideal Life's Simple 7 scores (≥ 10) among appears to be an approximate 65% relative risk reduction when compared to those with poor Life's Simple 7 scores (< 4). Overall, these results demonstrate that individuals with elevated Lp(a) benefit from traditional risk factor control, optimal physical activity and adherence to a diet rich in fruits and vegetables with regular fish and fibre intake that limits sodium and added sugars.

### Monocyte subset distribution in patients with stable atherosclerosis and elevated levels of lipoprotein (a) [^113Z9gZU]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Low credibility.

The plasma lipoprotein Lp(a) has been extensively described as an independent risk factor for both the development of stable atherosclerotic disease and the sudden onset of acute ischemic events including myocardial infarction. The underlying pathophysiological mechanisms for the enhanced atherothrombotic potential of Lp(a) include a facilitated entrapment within the intima, promotion of monocyte adhesion to the endothelial monolayer, an enhanced binding capacity of OxPLs, and antifibrinolytic and prothrombotic effects. Still, consensus among the respective cardiovascular societies on when and in whom to measure Lp(a) and how to react to elevated levels is missing. The aforementioned European Atherosclerosis Society Consensus Panel agreed on measuring Lp(a) once in individuals at high or intermediate risk for CVD including familial hypercholesterolemia and in patients with a positive family history of premature atherosclerotic disease and a 10-y risk of fatal CVD of 3% or more. They further recommend a desirable level for Lp(a) below the 80th percentile, corresponding to less than 50 mg/dL.

### Lp (a)-an overlooked risk factor [^111cQiB3]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)) is an increasingly discussed and studied risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and aortic valve stenosis. Many genetic and epidemiological studies support the important causal role that Lp(a) plays in the incidence of cardiovascular disease. Although dependent upon the threshold and unit of measurement of Lp(a), most estimates suggest between 20 and 30% of the world's population have elevated serum levels of Lp(a). Lp(a) levels are predominantly mediated by genetics and are not significantly modified by lifestyle interventions. Efforts are ongoing to develop effective pharmacotherapies to lower Lp(a) and to determine if lowering Lp(a) with these medications ultimately decreases the incidence of adverse cardiovascular events. In this review, the genetics and pathophysiological properties of Lp(a) will be discussed as well as the epidemiological data demonstrating its impact on the incidence of cardiovascular disease. Recommendations for screening and how to currently approach patients with elevated Lp(a) are also noted. Finally, the spectrum of pharmacotherapies under development for Lp(a) lowering is detailed.

Investigations and measurement.

There is no consensus regarding screening individuals for Lp(a) levels. Some guideline committees, such as the European Atherosclerosis Society/European Society of Cardiology and Canadian Cardiovascular Society, suggest measuring Lp(a) once as an adult for risk stratification. Other societies, such as the National Lipid Association, suggest screening only in high-risk situations, such as in individuals with a personal or family history of premature ASCVD, or those with known FH. At high concentrations, Lp(a) can interfere with LDL determination as a substantial portion of measured LDL-C may be contained within Lp(a) particles; therefore, measurement of Lp(a) may also be warranted in anyone who presents with LDL-C levels > 5.0 mmol/L (> 194 mg/dL) or reduced responsiveness to statins.

Because circulating Lp(a) is thought to remain relatively stable throughout life, once a baseline level is obtained, further monitoring is not required. Mass measurements of Lp(a) are less useful for predicting ASCVD risk; therefore, assays that measure molar concentrations are preferred. A high level of Lp(a) is considered to be ≥ 125 nmol/L (≥ 50 mg/dL).

Management.

Pharmacologic treatments targeting Lp(a) are currently in development, with an antisense oligonucleotide against Lp(a) demonstrating up to an 80% lowering. Ongoing outcome studies will establish if there is a role for this agent to treat elevated Lp(a) in ASCVD prevention. Until this is clarified, management of other ASCVD risk factors should be the mainstay of treatment for individuals with elevated Lp(a). More aggressive LDL-C lowering than would otherwise be recommended based on cardiovascular risk assessment may be warranted in those with elevated Lp(a).

Of currently approved lipid agents, statins can elevate Lp(a) levels, but are nonetheless considered first-line treatment in patients with high Lp(a) because of their general benefit with respect to elevated ASCVD risk. Ezetimibe has a neutral effect on Lp(a), whereas niacin lowers Lp(a). In a meta-analysis that included 6566 individuals, PCSK9 inhibitors lowered Lp(a) by 26%, although Lp(a) lowering is not currently an approved use for these agents.

### Lipoprotein (a) and atherogenesis [^111ZyD2k]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Lipoprotein(a) is a major inherited risk factor for atherosclerosis. Many of its activities depend on its plasminlike component, apolipoprotein(a). In vitro studies suggest that apolipoprotein(a) could enhance lipid deposition through binding to sites in the vessel wall, interfere with fibrinolysis, and modulate smooth muscle cell activity. Human and animal studies will be necessary to establish the physiologic importance of these mechanisms.

### Ancestry, lipoprotein (a), and cardiovascular risk thresholds: JACC review topic of the week [^116gbJqC]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). Medium credibility.

This study reviews ancestral differences in the genetics of the LPA gene, risk categories of elevated lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] as defined by guidelines, ancestry-specific Lp(a) risk, absolute and proportional risk, predictive value of risk thresholds among different ancestries, and differences between laboratory vs clinical accuracy in Lp(a) assays. For clinical decision-making, the preponderance of evidence suggests that the predictive value of Lp(a) does not vary sufficiently to mandate the use of ancestry-specific risk thresholds. This paper interprets the literature on Lp(a) and ancestral risk to support: 1) clinicians on understanding cardiovascular disease risk in different ancestral groups; 2) trialists for the design of clinical trials to ensure adequate ancestral diversity to support broad conclusions of drug effects; 3) regulators in the evaluation of the design and interpretation of results of Lp(a)-lowering trials with different Lp(a) inclusion thresholds; and 4) clinical laboratories to measure Lp(a) by assays that discriminate risk thresholds appropriately.

Measurement issues related to Lp(a)

Lp(a) measurement is challenging. There is substantial variability in assays, in part relating to apo(a) structure and variability in K-IV repeats. Ideally, clinical assays should use an antibody for a unique non-repetitive epitope in apo(a), recognizing each Lp(a) particle once and reporting levels as nmol/L. In practice, as raising such antibodies is difficult, most assays incorporate polyclonal antibodies which recognize different epitopes, and therefore potentially underestimate or overestimate Lp(a) levels depending on the presence of small or large isoforms, respectively. Incorporating multiple calibrators spanning a range of sizes in the assay can at least partly address this issue (see Supplementary material online, Figure S5 for further explanation). Working groups for standardization of Lp(a) measurement are in progress, aiming to provide improved reference materials as a major step forward in Lp(a) measurement.

Can Lp(a) concentrations be converted from mass units to molar units and vice versa?

Strictly speaking, assays based on polyclonal antibodies cannot report in molar units. As a compromise, they approximate their findings by comparison with apo(a) isoform-insensitive reference methods that use molar units; if this is not possible, reporting should be in mg/dL. Manufacturers should strive to ensure that assays are apo(a) isoform-insensitive and provide an appropriate conversion factor if both measures are given.

This panel does not recommend using a standard factor to convert between mg/dL and nmol/L, as assays vary extensively. Where both units are used in clinical practice, 2–2.5 is only a 'best guess' for a conversion factor (mg/dL to nmol/L). In this statement, units are given as in the original publications, and for general statements relating to Lp(a) concentration, in both mg/dL and nmol/L with an approximated 'interim' conversion factor of 2.5.

1.2 Epidemiological evidence linking Lp(a) to cardiovascular risk

Robust epidemiological, mendelian randomisation and genome wide association studies have established elevated Lp(a) as an independent and causal risk factor for ASCVD and CAVD. Early studies focusing on White European populations first identified the association between Lp(a) and cardiovascular risk. Subsequent large‐scale, multiethnic cohorts have confirmed these findings across diverse populations, highlighting the global relevance of elevated Lp(a). Investigators from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study evaluated over 13 000 Black and White participants in the United States and demonstrated that elevated Lp(a) levels are associated with an increased risk of coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke and overall CVD events. Subsequently, the Multiethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) and Dallas Heart Study (DHS) demonstrated that White, Black, Hispanic and Chinese Americans with elevated Lp(a) levels had significantly higher incidence of CHD and CVD events, independent of traditional risk factors. Subsequently, the case–control INTERHEART study demonstrated that while elevated Lp(a) levels confer cardiovascular risk across multiple ethnic groups, the absolute risk varies due to differences in Lp(a) distribution and the prevalence of other risk factors.

In addition to atherosclerotic disease, Lp(a) has emerged as an important risk factor for CAVD. The Copenhagen General Population Study provided compelling evidence linking elevated Lp(a) levels to increased risk of aortic valve stenosis. Notably, Mendelian randomisation analyses from this cohort highlighted a causal role for Lp(a) in CAVD, further solidifying its significance in cardiovascular pathology. Mendelian randomisation studies have provided compelling evidence for a causal relationship between genetically elevated Lp(a) and ASCVD as well as CAVD, independent of other lipid parameters. These findings support the hypothesis that Lp(a) is not merely a biomarker of cardiovascular risk but a causal factor in ASCVDand CAVDpathogenesis.

### Lipoprotein (a) levels in a global population with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease [^113Mwvy8]. Open Heart (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

Lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)) is an important genetically determined risk factor for atherosclerotic vascular disease (ASCVD). With the development of Lp(a)-lowering therapies, this study sought to characterise patterns of Lp(a) levels in a global ASCVD population and identify racial, ethnic, regional and gender differences.

Methods

A multicentre cross-sectional epidemiological study to estimate the prevalence of elevated Lp(a) in patients with a history of myocardial infarction, ischaemic stroke or peripheral artery disease conducted at 949 sites in 48 countries in North America, Europe, Asia, South America, South Africa and Australia between April 2019 and July 2021. Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and Lp(a) levels were measured either as mass (mg/dL) or molar concentration (nmol/L).

Results

Of 48 135 enrolled patients, 13.9% had prior measurements of Lp(a). Mean age was 62.6 (SD 10.1) years and 25.9% were female. Median Lp(a) was 18.0 mg/dL (IQR 7.9–57.1) or 42.0 nmol/L (IQR 15.0–155.4). Median LDL-C was 77 mg/dL (IQR 58.4–101.0). Lp(a) in women was higher, 22.8 (IQR 9.0–73.0) mg/dL, than in men, 17.0 (IQR 7.1–52.2) mg/dL, p < 0.001. Black patients had Lp(a) levels approximately threefold higher than white, Hispanic or Asian patients. Younger patients also had higher levels. 27.9% of patients had Lp(a) levels > 50 mg/dL, 20.7% had levels > 70 mg/dL, 12.9% were > 90 mg/dL and 26.0% of patients exceeded 150 nmol/L.

Conclusions

Globally, Lp(a) is measured in a small minority of patients with ASCVD and is highest in black, younger and female patients. More than 25% of patients had levels exceeding the established threshold for increased cardiovascular risk, approximately 50 mg/dL or 125 nmol/L.

Summary of key results.

Percentage of all adults, those with a family history of CVD, and those with a personal history of CVD who have had Lp(a) testing. CVD indicates cardiovascular disease; and Lp(a), lipoprotein(a).

This study enumerates how underrecognized lipoprotein(a) is and how underdiagnosed elevated lipoprotein(a) is despite its high prevalence, with > 20% of the general population corresponding to an estimated 64 million individuals in the United States and 1.4 billion individuals worldwide. Several barriers to more widespread lipoprotein(a) testing may exist and provide targets for improvement, including the following: (1) lack of awareness of lipoprotein(a) as a CVD risk factor, (2) lack of awareness of guideline indications for lipoprotein(a) testing, (3) lack of awareness of how to assess and manage risk in patients with elevated lipoprotein(a), (4) lack of implementation programs for lipoprotein(a) testing, (5) concerns about insurance coverage, and (6) uncertainty related to the variations in clinically available assays that reported lipoprotein(a) levels. Improved dissemination of the guidelines is needed, although there is also a need for more consistency across the major societal guidelines to provide clinicians with more certainty on when to use lipoprotein(a). Many high‐quality review articles discussing the mechanistic, epidemiologic, and human population genetic studies linking lipoprotein(a) to CVD, including the recent American Heart Association and European atherosclerosis society scientific statements on lipoprotein(a), exist and can be used for education. These statements also review evidence‐based clinical approaches on how to test for lipoprotein(a), incorporate lipoprotein(a) into atherosclerotic CVD risk assessment and manage risk associated with elevated lipoprotein(a), and they describe implications for cascade screening. In addition to education, implementation of practice changes would be important to increase lipoprotein(a) testing rates. This was exemplified in a prior study by our group, observing that the rate of lipoprotein(a) testing among individuals with AS at a single academic center increased from 8.5% to a peak of 24.2% between 2010 and 2020 as a result of educational efforts and use of order sets in the electronic medical record, demonstrating that targeted efforts can meaningfully impact rates of testing. Last, although targeted lipoprotein(a)‐lowering therapies are not yet clinically available, broader recognition of elevated lipoprotein(a) would facilitate enrollment of adequate numbers of diverse participants in existing or planned clinical trials evaluating such therapies.

Lp(a) structure, function, and genetics.

Lp(a) is a distinct lipoprotein that shares structural similarity to LDL, with a single apo B-100 molecule on its surface. Unlike LDL, however, Lp(a) has a unique polymorphic apo(a) glycoprotein tail covalently linked to the apo B-100 via disulfide bridging. The apo(a) tail contains 5 "kringles", or cysteine-rich domains, with the fourth being structurally similar to plasminogen, an antithrombotic plasma protein. Although Lp(a) has similar cholesterol content to LDL, it is structurally, metabolically, and pathogenically distinct. While there are no clearly defined genetic syndromes associated with Lp(a), levels are largely genetically determined, with size polymorphisms in coding regions of the LPA locus encoding different sizes of apo(a) isoforms, which account for > 90% of the variation in serum Lp(a) concentrations between individuals. In 2018, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention introduced a new diagnostic code for elevated Lp(a), namely International Classification of Diseases-10 E78.41.

Role of Lp(a) in ASCVD.

There is a strong association between Lp(a) levels and risk for ASCVD. Because apo(a) shares structural similarity with plasminogen, it is hypothesized that the apo(a) itself plays a direct role in atherogenesis and/or thrombosis (Table 6). Proposed mechanisms for the prothrombotic effect of Lp(a) include competitive inhibition of plasminogen leading to a decrease in fibrinolysis. Lp(a) particles also interact with endothelial macrophages, generating foam cells and atherosclerotic plaques, as well as potentially enhancing oxidation of LDL. Lp(a) is found within human atheroma and in a greater relative amount in plaques from individuals with unstable compared with stable heart disease. The molar concentration of Lp(a) determines ASCVD risk, rather than Lp(a) cholesterol content or particle size.

In our analysis we did not differentiate between subjects with or without CHD at baseline, and hence the risk estimates for Lp(a) versus LDL we generated incorporate both the primary and secondary prevention scenarios within the context of the UK Biobank population. However, current pharmaceutical interventions in both primary and secondary prevention settings may modify the association of Lp(a) with CHD risk. Only when the results of trials of Lp(a) lowering in individuals with and without CHD are reported will it become clear how these genetically determined risk estimates translate into clinical practice.

Lipoprotein apheresis for high Lp(a) — Currently, the only FDA-approved therapy for treating high Lp(a) is lipoprotein apheresis, based on observational data, and apheresis is now also approved for use in high-risk patients with FH and ASCVD whose Lp(a) level remains ≥ 60 mg/dL (∼150 nmol/L) and LDL-C ≥ 100 mg/dL on maximally tolerated lipid-lowering therapy; because it removes apoB-containing lipoproteins, both LDL-C and Lp(a) are substantially reduced acutely but return toward pretreatment levels between procedures, and apheresis is not available at all centers and can be expensive and time-consuming.

### Lipoprotein (a) in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and aortic stenosis: a European Atherosclerosis Society consensus statement [^113wy3sZ]. European Heart Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

This 2022 European Atherosclerosis Society lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] consensus statement updates evidence for the role of Lp(a) in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and aortic valve stenosis, provides clinical guidance for testing and treating elevated Lp(a) levels, and considers its inclusion in global risk estimation. Epidemiologic and genetic studies involving hundreds of thousands of individuals strongly support a causal and continuous association between Lp(a) concentration and cardiovascular outcomes in different ethnicities; elevated Lp(a) is a risk factor even at very low levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. High Lp(a) is associated with both microcalcification and macrocalcification of the aortic valve. Current findings do not support Lp(a) as a risk factor for venous thrombotic events and impaired fibrinolysis. Very low Lp(a) levels may associate with increased risk of diabetes mellitus meriting further study. Lp(a) has pro-inflammatory and pro-atherosclerotic properties, which may partly relate to the oxidized phospholipids carried by Lp(a). This panel recommends testing Lp(a) concentration at least once in adults; cascade testing has potential value in familial hypercholesterolaemia, or with family or personal history of (very) high Lp(a) or premature ASCVD. Without specific Lp(a)-lowering therapies, early intensive risk factor management is recommended, targeted according to global cardiovascular risk and Lp(a) level. Lipoprotein apheresis is an option for very high Lp(a) with progressive cardiovascular disease despite optimal management of risk factors. In conclusion, this statement reinforces evidence for Lp(a) as a causal risk factor for cardiovascular outcomes. Trials of specific Lp(a)-lowering treatments are critical to confirm clinical benefit for cardiovascular disease and aortic valve stenosis.

### Impact of proprotein convertase subtilisin / kexin type 9 inhibitors on Lipoprotein (a): a meta-analysis and meta-regression of randomized controlled trials [^117X9hLF]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

An elevated level of Lp(a) is an independent highly prevalent risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. In this analysis of 47 RCTs comparing PCSK9i monoclonal antibody therapy vs placebo or ezetimibe, PCSK9is reduced Lp(a) levels by 27% on average. Mean change from the baseline in LDL-C and ApoB positively correlates with Lp(a) reduction. Given the modest but significant reduction in Lp(a) level, further research is needed to evaluate the impact of monoclonal antibody based PCSK9i on cardiovascular outcomes in patients with elevated Lp(a).

Perspectives

COMPETENCY IN MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE: PCSK9is reduced lipoprotein(a) levels regardless of comparator, treatment duration, type of PCSK9i used, or the presence of familial hypercholesterolemia.

TRANSLATIONAL OUTLOOK: The impact of PCSK9is on cardiovascular outcomes in patients with elevated lipoprotein(a) needs to be evaluated.

In this meta-analysis of statin trials, Lp(a) and LDL-C levels were independent and additive cardiovascular risk factors, and potent LDL-C level reduction did not offset Lp(a)-mediated risk. Our findings emphasize the need for testing and incorporation of Lp(a) into cardiovascular risk assessment. Future trials will elucidate the role of targeted Lp(a) therapeutics for cardiovascular risk reduction in the context of LDL-C levels.

### Lipoprotein (a) genotype influences the clinical diagnosis of familial hypercholesterolemia [^1163UTTo]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

Our results highlight the importance of measuring lp(a) to perform the diagnosis of FH appropriately and to exclude the possibility that the observed phenotype is driven by elevated levels of lp(a) before performing the genetic test that is often requested based on the presence of elevated LDL‐C levels.

Clinical and laboratory investigations for differentiating FH, elevated lp(a), or the combination of both are also important for accurate risk stratification and treatment strategies, as in the future patients with both elevated lp(a) and FH condition may be shown to benefit from interventions to reduce both LDL‐C and lp(a) plasma levels.

### Quantifying the contribution of lipoprotein (a) to all apoB containing particles [^116YUgHP]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Elevated lipoprotein (a) [Lp(a)] is an independent risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). As clinical LDL cholesterol [LDL-C] incorporates cholesterol from Lp(a) [Lp(a)-C], there is interest in quantifying the contribution of Lp(a)-C to LDL-C given implications for risk assessment, diagnosis, and treatment. Estimating Lp(a)-C is subject to inaccuracies; measuring Lp(a) particle number [Lp(a)-P] is more accurate.

Objective

To capture how Lp(a) contributes to the concentration of atherogenic particles, we demonstrate a particle-based approach using readily available measures of Lp(a)-P and apolipoprotein B (apoB).

Methods

Using the Very Large Database of Lipids (VLDbL), we compared Lp(a)-P (nmol/L) with all apoB containing particles ("apoB-P"). apoB-P was calculated by converting apoB mass to molar concentration using the preserved molecular weight of apoB100 (512 kg/mol). We calculated the percentage of Lp(a)-P relative to apoB-P by Lp(a)-P deciles and stratified by triglycerides, LDL-C, and non-HDL-C.

Results

158,260 patients from the VLDbL were included. The fraction Lp(a)-P/apoB-P increased with rising Lp(a)-P. Lp(a)-P comprised on average 3% of apoB containing particles among the study population and 15% at the highest Lp(a)-P decile. Lp(a)-P/apoB-P decreased at higher levels of triglycerides and LDL-C owing to larger contributions from VLDL and LDL.

Conclusions

We demonstrate a particle-based approach to quantify the contribution of Lp(a) to all apoB-containing particles using validated and widely available clinical assays. This approach keeps in line with recommendations to move away from mass-based measurements of Lp(a) and prioritize more accurate particle-based measurements. Future research applying this method could define clinically meaningful thresholds and inform use in risk assessment and management.
