## Question

monitoring low birth weight full term infant weighing 2485 with a discharge weight of 2331 and a weight at 6 days old of 2311.

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to monitor and manage a full-term, low-birth-weight infant with a birth weight of 2485 g, a discharge weight of 2331 g, and a 6-day weight of 2311 g, with attention to weight loss, feeding, jaundice, hypoglycemia, and follow-up. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the infant's risk category and whether this represents normal physiology or pathological weight loss. Then, I should verify the weight-loss calculations and compare them with evidence-based thresholds. Next, I will assess feeding adequacy and decide whether supplementation is indicated. After that, I need to check for hyperbilirubinemia and hypoglycemia risks and plan screening. Finally, I will outline a follow-up schedule, growth targets, and parent education, and I will consider special considerations if the infant is small for gestational age rather than constitutionally small.

> Let me first confirm the infant's risk category and baseline. A birth weight of 2485 g meets the WHO definition of low birth weight (< 2500 g), but the infant is full term, which places him in a different risk profile than preterm LBW infants; I should not conflate management pathways meant for very low birth weight or preterm infants with this term case, so I need to ensure I apply term-infant guidance here rather than preterm protocols [^1124xxLS]. I should also confirm whether the infant is small for gestational age (SGA), because SGA status would alter hypoglycemia risk and long-term monitoring; if gestational age is unknown or uncertain, I should prioritize growth trajectory monitoring and early follow-up while verifying SGA status with available records or growth charts [^11269rMG] [^112Eg4LS].

> Now, I will calculate the weight changes and double-check the percentages. From birth to discharge, the loss is 2485 g minus 2331 g equals 154 g, which is 6.2% of birth weight. From birth to day 6, the loss is 2485 g minus 2311 g equals 174 g, which is 7.0% of birth weight. From discharge to day 6, the change is a 20 g loss, which is 0.9% of discharge weight. Wait, let me verify the discharge-to-day-6 math: 2331 g to 2311 g is indeed a 20 g loss, so the calculation is correct.

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should compare these figures with accepted thresholds. For term infants, weight loss up to about 7.5–10% can be within physiologic range depending on timing and feeding support, and many infants regain birth weight by 7–14 days, though some take longer, especially after cesarean delivery. Thus, a 7.0% loss by day 6 is at the upper end of normal but not necessarily pathological if intake and elimination are adequate and the infant is otherwise well [^111iAT6J]. I should also note that the small additional loss after discharge is modest and could reflect normal day-to-day variation, but I need to ensure the trend does not continue downward and that intake is sufficient [^112Nm8mE].

> Next, I should review feeding adequacy and decide on supplementation. I need to check feeding frequency, duration, latch, milk transfer, and parent perception of milk supply; if available, pre- and post-feed test weights can quantify intake, and observing a feed helps identify latch or transfer issues. If the infant is nursing effectively eight or more times per 24 hours, has adequate urine and stool output, and is consolable between feeds, exclusive breastfeeding can continue with close follow-up; if intake appears insufficient or weight loss approaches 10%, targeted supplementation per ABM Protocol #3 is appropriate, prioritizing mother's own expressed milk, then donor milk, then formula, while preserving breastfeeding and addressing underlying causes of low transfer [^111iAT6J] [^113sMLxL]. I should confirm that supplementation is not routine but responsive to specific indications such as excessive weight loss, inadequate intake, or rising bilirubin, and I must avoid water or dextrose water, which are not beneficial and may interfere with breastfeeding [^116kypNB].

> I will now examine jaundice risk and follow-up timing. Because the infant is early in life and had early discharge, I should screen for hyperbilirubinemia using transcutaneous bilirubin or total serum bilirubin and align follow-up with the AAP hyperbilirubinemia guideline's risk-based approach, incorporating gestational age, age in hours, and the gap between bilirubin and the phototherapy threshold to determine timing of reassessment. For infants discharged before 72 hours, follow-up within 24–48 hours is recommended, especially for exclusively breastfed infants, to mitigate bilirubin-related neurotoxicity risk and ensure feeding is protecting against excessive weight loss [^114nE3J6] [^114WMpSV] [^115Pup7s].

> Let me consider hypoglycemia risk next. Low birth weight alone does not automatically place a term infant in a high-risk category for neonatal hypoglycemia. However, if there is suspected or confirmed SGA, maternal diabetes, perinatal stress, or poor feeding, I should screen per ABM Protocol #1, starting within the first feeding window and continuing until stable preprandial levels are documented on at least three measurements. If hypoglycemia persists beyond 48 hours or is severe, I should escalate evaluation and consider a supervised fast before discharge to ensure metabolic stability [^115Cf3V2] [^11278P1Q].

> Next, I should review the follow-up cadence and growth targets. I need to ensure the first post-discharge visit occurs within 24–48 hours for early-discharge infants, with lactation support and a structured assessment of intake, elimination, and growth. If the infant is demonstrating adequate intake and weight gain, visits can space out, but if weight gain is suboptimal, weekly follow-up is warranted until consistent growth is established. For term infants, expected weight gain after regaining birth weight is about 20–30 g/day; I should plot measurements on WHO growth charts and track weight, length, and head circumference at each visit, adjusting the feeding plan if gains fall below about 20 g/day or if weight-for-length trends suggest under- or overnutrition [^115Pup7s] [^114yBQT7].

> But wait, what if this infant is actually SGA rather than constitutionally small? If SGA is confirmed, I should anticipate higher risks of early hypoglycemia and long-term metabolic vulnerability, and I should avoid excessive catch-up weight gain while ensuring adequate nutrition; this means closer follow-up in the first weeks, careful attention to feeding quality rather than volume alone, and longitudinal monitoring of growth velocity with a plan to avoid formula overfeeding or unnecessary supplementation beyond medical indications [^112Eg4LS] [^111nX682] [^115fLucd].

> I should double-check parent education and safety-netting. Parents need clear instructions on feeding frequency and duration, how to assess urine and stool output, signs of dehydration or illness, and when to seek urgent care; they should also receive written feeding plans and be connected with lactation support early, as this reduces complications and improves breastfeeding continuation and infant growth outcomes [^111iAT6J].

> Putting this together, my immediate actions are as follows: confirm SGA status if possible. Arrange lactation support within 24–48 hours. Obtain a same-day weight check to confirm trend. Assess intake with test weights if concerns persist. Screen bilirubin and arrange follow-up within 24–48 hours of discharge. Screen for hypoglycemia only if risk factors are present. And schedule weekly visits until consistent weight gain of at least 20 g/day is established, then transition to routine pediatric intervals while plotting growth on WHO charts and reassessing the feeding plan at each visit [^114nE3J6] [^11278P1Q] [^115Pup7s] [^114yBQT7].

This infant has lost 7.0% of birth weight and remains 1.0% below discharge weight at 6 days, which is **within normal early weight loss** for breastfed term infants [^112Nm8mE] but warrants close monitoring. The priority is to **ensure adequate intake** (≥ 8 feeds/24 h, with good latch and milk transfer) [^111iAT6J], track urine/stool output (≥ 6 wet and ≥ 3 stool/day) [^notfound], and arrange early follow-up within 24–48 hours to reassess weight, breastfeeding, and jaundice risk [^115Pup7s] [^114WMpSV]. If weight loss exceeds 10% or intake is inadequate, initiate supplementation per ABM Protocol #3 (mother's milk first, then donor milk, then formula) [^111iAT6J] and refer to lactation support [^notfound]. Routine labs are not indicated unless clinical concerns arise; continue routine newborn care and monitor for dehydration, hypoglycemia, or jaundice [^114nE3J6] [^11278P1Q].

## Clinical significance of weight changes

- **Birth weight**: 2485 g
- **Discharge weight**: 2331 g (weight loss of 154 g, 6.2% of birth weight)
- **Weight at 6 days**: 2311 g (additional weight loss of 20 g since discharge, 0.9% of discharge weight; total loss of 174 g, 7.0% of birth weight)

In breastfed term infants, **physiological weight loss** is typically 5–10% of birth weight, with recovery by days 10–14 [^114yBQT7]. Thus, a 7.0% loss at 6 days is within normal limits but warrants close monitoring to ensure adequate intake and prevent further decline [^114yBQT7].

---

## Recommended monitoring parameters

### Weight monitoring

Schedule **early follow-up** within 24–48 hours after discharge to reassess weight, breastfeeding, and jaundice risk [^115Pup7s] [^114WMpSV]. Continue **frequent checks** every 2–3 days until consistent weight gain is established, then space to weekly until the infant regains birth weight.

---

### Feeding assessment

Confirm **breastfeeding frequency** of at least 8 feeds per 24 hours with effective latch and milk transfer [^1163gumf]. Consider **test weights** or pre/post weights to quantify intake if concerns persist [^114eQrnd]. Provide **lactation support** with early referral to a lactation consultant to optimize feeding and milk transfer [^1163gumf].

---

### Clinical signs of adequate intake

- **Hydration**: ≥ 6 wet diapers per day
- **Stooling**: ≥ 3 yellow, seedy stools per day by day 4–5
- **Behavior**: alert when awake, satisfied after feeds

---

### Laboratory monitoring

Routine labs are not indicated unless clinical concerns arise; **selective testing** may include serum bilirubin if jaundice is present or glucose if symptomatic or risk factors exist [^114nE3J6] [^11278P1Q].

---

## Clinical concerns and interventions

### Excessive weight loss (> 10% of birth weight)

If weight loss exceeds 10%, **supplementation** should follow ABM Protocol #3 (mother's milk first, then donor milk, then formula) [^111iAT6J]. Concurrently, **lactation support** should be provided to address underlying breastfeeding issues [^111iAT6J].

---

### Hypoglycemia risk

Risk factors include low birth weight, inadequate intake, and maternal diabetes; **monitoring** should include glucose screening if symptomatic or risk factors are present [^11278P1Q].

---

### Jaundice

Assess for **clinical jaundice** and obtain transcutaneous or serum bilirubin if indicated [^114nE3J6]. Follow **hyperbilirubinemia guidelines** for management and follow-up [^114WMpSV].

---

## Parent education and support

- **Feeding cues**: Teach recognition of early hunger/satiety cues and avoid scheduled feeds [^1163gumf].
- **Weight tracking**: Instruct on home monitoring and when to seek help.
- **Support**: Provide lactation resources and emotional support to reduce stress and support breastfeeding success [^1163gumf].

---

## Follow-up plan

Arrange an **early visit** within 24–48 hours after discharge, then continue **frequent follow-up** every 2–3 days until consistent weight gain is established, followed by weekly visits until birth weight is regained. Maintain **routine newborn care**, including immunizations and developmental screening.

---

## Monitoring and management plan

| **Parameter** | **Current status** | **Recommended action** |
|-|-|-|

### Early postnatal growth in a subset of convalescing extremely-low-birth-weight neonates: approximating the "Index fetus" Ex utero [^114NZ5ck]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2015). Low credibility.

Objectives

The aim of the study was to evaluate whether a subset of noncritically ill, convalescing extremely-low-birth-weight neonates who were managed using a standardized nutritional protocol could achieve the growth rate of the index fetus. We hypothesized that an aggressive nutritional protocol applied to noncritically ill, convalescing premature neonates could achieve the growth rate of the index fetus.

Methods

This was a retrospective review of a subset of 21 premature neonates defined by 4 criteria: inborn or transferred-in within 24 hours of birth, gestational age < 30 weeks and birth weight ≤ 1000g, hospitalized > 35 postnatal days, and discharged between 34 and 42 weeks postconceptual age. Optimal growth at discharge was defined as weight and head circumference > 10th percentile compared with comparable gestational age fetal parameters.

Results

Protein intake of ≥ 1.4g·kg·day and energy ≥ 30kcal·kg·day were provided as of the first postnatal day. Proteins ≥ 3g·kg·day and > 80kcal·kg·day were established ≥ 10th postnatal day. Birth weight was regained by postnatal day 10 ± 5 day (mean+standard deviation). Nutrition was predominantly enteral (ie, > 50% of all calories) after the 11th postnatal day. At discharge, 71% (15/21) by weight and 76% (16/21) by head circumference were > 10th percentile. After 30 weeks postconceptual age, the cohort exceeded the weight gain rate (g/wk) of a 10th-percentile fetus.

Conclusions

In a selected subset of noncritically ill, convalescing extremely-low-birth-weight neonates, after a brief period of unavoidable postnatal weight loss and body water adjustment, adequate nutrition from birth can enable a more homeostatic pattern of growth that approximates growth of the index fetus.

Postdischarge growth and nutrition monitoring for preterm infants — Infants with adequate growth should be followed at 1 month following discharge. For infants with inadequate growth since discharge, weekly follow-up until the infant has demonstrated appropriate growth on the feeding plan. For all preterm infants, growth monitoring is recommended every month until 6 months' corrected age, then every 2 months till 1 year, and biochemical markers should be followed 1 month after discharge and at 4 months' corrected age. Clinicians may also consider test weighing to assess the quantity of milk transferred.

### Office care of the premature infant: part II. common… [^111Hum8s]. AAFP (1998). Low credibility.

During office visits, signs and symptoms such as tachycardia, tachypnea, pallor, lethargy, poor feeding, poor weight gain and apnea with bradycardia may indicate the presence of anemia. If these signs and symptoms develop, the blood count should be checked. Routine hemoglobin determinations may be considered for infants with hemolytic disease, such as ABO or Rh incompatibility. Although hematocrit levels below 25 percent are often poorly tolerated. Evidence of any single developmental abnormality in an infant born prematurely signifies the need for a careful search for other abnormalities. Because hypoxic injury is usually a diffuse process, multiple abnormalities are present in many children who incur hypoxic injury. A multidisciplinary team is usually best equipped to perform this evaluation, and consultation with a developmental pediatrician is appropriate. Early intervention should be undertaken in infants with definite abnormalities.

Specific measures, such as nonnutritive sucking in gavage- or tube-fed infants may be especially helpful in improving growth and development while minimizing oxygen utilization. 12 In the absence of intraventricular hemorrhage, periventricular leukomalacia or ventricular dilatation, the incidence of major developmental problems is not increased in premature infants. A dilated indirect ophthalmoscopic examination should be performed in all infants with a birth weight of 1, 500 g or less, with a gestational age of 28 weeks or less, or who otherwise are thought to be at high risk of retinopathy because of other risk factors such as oxygen therapy and anemia. 15 One guideline recommends an initial screening examination at four to six weeks' chronologic age by an ophthalmologist, with follow-up ophthalmologic examinations as needed based on the initial findings.

Although apnea monitoring is controversial and unproved as a method of preventing SIDS, many premature infants, both those with and those without documented apnea, are discharged with provisions for at-home apnea monitoring. Criteria for at-home apnea monitoring include the following: infants less than 34 weeks' gestation at birth; significant apnea documented after birth and not associated with a reversible illness; a family history of siblings with SIDS; and bronchopulmonary dysplasia or intraventricular hemorrhage. Prognosis Approximately 85 percent of infants with a birth weight under 1, 500 g survive.

Clinical Management of Children Born SGA

Early Life and Childhood

During the first 2 years of life, the clinical management focuses on optimal nutrition to ensure optimal catch-up growth and prevention of hypoglycemia, excessive weight gain, neurodevelopmental delay, and exclusion of an underlying cause including genetic conditions. Some may also require transient diazoxide to treat hypoglycemia which has shown to be beneficial. Recent reviews with longer-term follow-up of children born SGA concluded that breastfeeding promotes growth without causing adverse body composition or reduced insulin sensitivity and is, therefore, ideal for infants born SGA. A balanced diet with age-appropriate macro- and micronutrients is recommended for optimal growth and development. Early growth monitoring provides useful information regarding the growth pattern of neonates born SGA and is a vital tool in clinical practice. Weight, length, head circumference, and weight for length or BMI should be monitored every 3 months during the first year of life, 6-monthly in the second year of life, and yearly thereafter until the child reaches their genetic height potential or a height in the normal range. The growth parameters should be plotted on an appropriate growth chart and assessed for adequacy. After the first 2 years of life, besides the key elements of nutrition, growth, and neurodevelopment, the clinical management also focuses on pubertal development, and metabolic parameters, when indicated. Evaluating pubertal onset and progression is important since this could influence treatment strategies. As bone age is inaccurate in predicting adult height in children born SGA, routine bone age assessment is not recommended. Those born very preterm (gestational age < 28 weeks) or severely SGA (birth weight and/or birth length < −3 SDS for gestational age), with short parents, or having a syndrome associated with growth retardation, should be monitored more closely and referred to a pediatric endocrinologist in the first year of life.

Excessive weight gain (a change in weight for length > 0.67 SDS, that is, passing weight SDS lines in upward direction), particularly during early life, should be avoided. A healthy lifestyle, including a balanced diet and regular physical activity must be encouraged. Metabolic parameters, such as fasting plasma glucose, oral glucose tolerance test, and lipid profile are only recommended in children with overweight (BMI ≥ 1 SDS) or obesity (BMI ≥ 2 SDS), those with a family history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, or when clinical signs suggest a metabolic disease. Those with a small head circumference have the highest risk of cognitive impairment. Early neurodevelopment evaluation and interventions are warranted in children at risk.

Additional challenges in low- and middle-income countries

In low- and middle-income countries, only 50% to 60% of infants born SGA show catch-up growth in either height, weight, or both, due to multiple factors, such as poor maternal and postnatal nutrition, poor hygiene, many infections, and factors associated with low socioeconomic status. Catch-up growth in countries with poor nutrition and relatively low protein dietary content may be delayed up to 4 to 5 years of age. Children of upper socioeconomic status show better catch-up growth. Appropriate local reference charts can be used to monitor growth of children born SGA. Using WHO charts in low-income countries has its problems, as many healthy children fall below the third percentile of WHO charts for both height and weight with relative sparing of weight-for-height. In SGA, this effect is more pronounced, and hence one should give more attention to the growth trajectory than to a single reading of a growth parameter for stunting and wasting.

Given the high prevalence of malnutrition and infections, recommendations may be different beyond the sensitive window of metabolic programming, specifically, the first 3 to 6 months of life. This may only be achieved by changing the feeding policy based on very close monitoring of the growth trajectory — allowing neither failure to thrive nor excessive catch-up in weight. Exclusive breastfeeding has been associated with less rapid catch-up and lower fasting insulin and glucose concentrations, at least in the short term, and is associated with a consistent protective effect against later obesity in numerous observational studies and meta-analyses. Therefore, current WHO policy recommends exclusive breastfeeding or using standard formulas rather than nutrient-enriched formulas up to the age of 6 months. For low-birth-weight infants in extremely impoverished environments, clearly the priority is to prevent malnutrition and growth faltering.

### WHO recommendations for care of the preterm or low-birth-weight infant [^114UoubP]. Geneva: World Health Organization (2022). High credibility.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for preterm infant, more specifically with respect to feeding, WHO 2022 guidelines recommend to feed preterm and low-birth-weight infants, including very preterm and very low-birth-weight infants, as early as possible from the first day after birth. Put infants able to breastfeed to the breast as soon as possible after birth. Give mother's own milk (expressed) as soon as it becomes available in infants unable to breastfeed. Give donor human milk wherever possible if mother's own milk is not available.

Discussion

From this analysis, 38.7% of the preterm VLBW infants had growth failure with weight, length and head circumference below the 10th percentile for PMA by 12 weeks post-discharge. Growth failure was more frequent among SGA infants 28/60 (46.6%) compared to 15/51(29.4%) of non-SGA infants although this difference was statistically not significant (p 0.06) (Table 4).

Table 4
Factors associated with growth failure

Only 13 (11.7%) of the study infants had recovered birth weight at the time of hospital discharge. Of these 8 were appropriately grown for gestational age and 5 were SGA at birth. This very slow birth weight recovery is comparable to findings from a study conducted in the same facility among none SGA low birth weight infants, but slower than findings from other studies. This observation can be explained by the difference in practice between our facility and others. In our facility, VLBW infants do not routinely receive total parenteral nutrition as enteral feeds are introduced.

Of the 98/111(88.2%) discharged home before birth weight recovery; 58(59.1%) recovered birth weight by 2 weeks after discharge and 40(40.9%) recovered 2–4 weeks after discharge. Whereas discharge weight of ≤ 1200 g did not seem to be significantly associated with growth failure (OR 1.34 p 0.48) (Table 4), the majority of infants 34/40(85%) who had not recovered birth weight by 2 weeks post-discharge were those discharged with a weight of ≤ 1200 g. Infants discharged with weight ≤ 1200 g are likely to be more immature and more susceptible to environmental stressors such as hypothermia accounting for slower growth among this weight category.

By 4 weeks post-discharge 28/111 (25.2%) infants were reportedly receiving KMC for 12–20 h/day (Table 2). Despite kangaroo mother care being associated with improved growth beyond 40 weeks postmenstrual age; our study participants were not receiving continuous KMC as recommended this exposed them to increased caloric needs for maintaining body temperature possibly at the expense of growth. It is important that continuous KMC is emphasized and supported in the community in low resource settings.

### Poor birth weight recovery among low birth weight / preterm infants following hospital discharge in Kampala, Uganda [^112SMsP3]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2012). Low credibility.

It appears that early discharge was detrimental to proper post-natal growth in many of the study participants. Although a more prolonged hospital stay offers an appealing, albeit costly, alternative for supporting proper weight gain and neonatal care in low-income countries, this option is not currently feasible in settings similar to Uganda. The factors that significantly contributed to failure to regain birth weight among the LBW infants were hospital stay of more than 7 days and initiation of first feed more than 48 hours. We did not explore in detail the reason for long hospital stays among our study infants, however prolonged stay due to medical illness may be fatal to growth as opposed to stay for nutritional support. Feeding in the first one hour of life (WHO recommendation) may not be possible in many of the LBW infants and other institutional setups, like the initial separation of the mother and baby may contribute to the delay. Although there have been documented cost-effective interventions in neonatal care, few reach preterm infants in low-income countries. Further research is needed to assess care practices given to the infants while at home in order to better understand any factors that may be contributing to poor weight gain. The need for simple interventions that can be implemented following discharge is particularly great since keeping infants hospitalized until they attain weights of 2000–2500 grams is not possible due to lack of space. Simple interventions to improve infant care in the community may include women support groups, family members and the village health teams to encourage infant feeding, skin-to-skin care, and community healthcare worker assessments to identify and treat neonatal sepsis. This has been demonstrated to be feasible in some low resource settings in Asia and has been proved successful.

### ACOG practice bulletin no. 127: management of preterm labor [^115JfXW5]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2012). Low credibility.

Preterm birth is the leading cause of neonatal mortality and the most common reason for antenatal hospitalization(1–4). In the United States, approximately 12% of all live births occur before term, and preterm labor preceded approximately 50% of these preterm births (5, 6). Although the causes of preterm labor are not well understood, the burden of preterm births is clear — preterm births account for approximately 70% of neonatal deaths and 36% of infant deaths as well as 25–50% of cases of long-term neurologic impairment in children (7–9). A 2006 report from the Institute of Medicine estimated the annual cost of preterm birth in the United States to be $26.2 billion or more than$51,000 per premature infant (10). However, identifying women who will give birth preterm is an inexact process. The purpose of this document is to present the various methods proposed to manage preterm labor and to review the evidence for the roles of these methods in clinical practice. Identification and management of risk factors for preterm labor are not addressed in this document.

### How to assess slow growth in the breastfed infant. birth to 3 months [^114yBQT7]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

Pediatricians must monitor early breastfeeding to detect and manage breastfeeding difficulties that lead to slow weight gain and subsequent low milk production. Infant growth during the first 3 months of life provides a clear indication of breastfeeding progress. Healthy, breastfed infants lose less than 10% of birth weight and return to birth weight by age 2 weeks. They then gain weight steadily, at a minimum of 20 g per day, from age 2 weeks to 3 months. Any deviation from this pattern is cause for concern and for a thorough evaluation of the breastfeeding process. Evaluation includes history taking and physical examination for the mother and infant. Observation of a breastfeeding session by a skilled clinician is crucial. A differential diagnosis is generated, followed by a problem-oriented management plan. Special techniques may be used to assist in complicated situations. Ongoing monitoring is required until weight gain has normalized. In most cases, early intervention can restore promptly infant growth and maternal milk supply. Underlying illness of the infant or mother must be considered if weight gain and milk supply do not respond to the earlier-mentioned interventions as expected. Physicians are responsible for knowledge about additional resources and for coordination of breastfeeding care. Pediatricians have a pivotal role in achieving the goals of optimal breastfeeding and appropriate infant growth.

### Obstetric care consensus no. 6: periviable birth [^114Pteem]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Medium credibility.

Periviable birth — A recent executive summary defined periviable birth as delivery occurring from 20 0/7 weeks to 25 6/7 weeks of gestation. Approximately 0.5% of all births occur before the third trimester of pregnancy, and these very early deliveries result in the majority of neonatal deaths and more than 40% of infant deaths. Multiple factors have been found to be associated with short-term and long-term outcomes in addition to gestational age, including nonmodifiable factors (eg, fetal sex, weight, plurality), potentially modifiable antepartum and intrapartum factors (eg, location of delivery, intent to intervene by cesarean delivery or induction for delivery, administration of antenatal corticosteroids and magnesium sulfate), and postnatal management (eg, starting or withholding and continuing or withdrawing intensive care after birth). Antepartum and intrapartum management options vary depending upon circumstances and may include short-term tocolytic therapy for preterm labor to allow time for administration of antenatal steroids, antibiotics to prolong latency after premature rupture of membranes or for intrapartum group B streptococci prophylaxis, and delivery, including cesarean delivery, for concern regarding fetal well-being or fetal malpresentation. Whenever possible, periviable births for which maternal or neonatal intervention is planned should occur in centers that offer expertise in maternal and neonatal care and the needed infrastructure, including intensive care units, to support such services.

### Nutrition for the preterm, VLBW infant after NICU discharge-AAP… [^1163gumf]. AAP (2022). Medium credibility.

As recently as 2013, up to 50% of VLBW infants exhibited postnatal growth failure and 25% demonstrated severe growth failure. Importance of Human Milk to the VLBW Infant Mother's own milk, appropriately fortified, is the optimal nutrition for VLBW infants.
- Every mother should receive information about the critical importance of mother's own milk to the health of a VLBW infant.
- Mother's own milk has been associated with multiple health benefits for VLBW infants, including lower incidences of The principal goal for infants with very low birth weight is the provision of the mother's own milk, with donor human milk as a bridge or support while the mother's milk is made available or increasing in volume.
- Reevaluating the newborn within 24 to 48 hours.
- Arranging post-discharge lactation consultation, if feasible.

La Leche League International and Women, Infants, and Children are valuable community resources that offer lactation support and peer counseling. Some hospitals offer lactation support clinics.
- Advising the mother to continue to keep a log of the infant's feedings, any supplementation given, and the infant's elimination pattern.
- Ensuring that the mother has a clear feeding plan for her late preterm infant at discharge regardless of whether the infant is breast- or formula-feeding.
- Tailoring formula intake recommendations to the individual neonate. Although most formula-fed late preterm infants are fed a 19−20 cal/oz term infant formula, those who are small for gestational age or who exhibit excessive weight loss or poor weight gain may require higher-calorie full-term or post discharge preterm infant formula.
- Advising the mother that her infant should be breastfed with careful attention to feeding cues and nurse, 8 times in a 24-hour period.
- Transitioning from higher-calorie formula to standard 19−20 cal/oz infant formula when the infant is demonstrating good weight gain and growth is above the 10th percentile for postmenstrual age on the World Health Organization Growth Charts for Infants 0 to 24 Months.

### New World Health Organization recommendations for care of preterm or low birth weight infants: health policy [^114jx4VY]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

In health facilities, a conditional recommendation based on low-certainty evidence was made that scheduled feeding may be considered for preterm infants < 34 weeks gestation until they are discharged, rather than responsive feeding. This decision was informed by evidence of small benefits from responsive feeding on decreased length of hospital stay (very low certainty) but also small harms from responsive feeding on decreased weight gain until discharge (low certainty). The trials included in the review used various feeding schedules; the GDG suggested that 2–3 hourly scheduled feedings may be used, as this is a commonly used and feasible schedule. A recommendation could not be made on feeding after hospital discharge. It was emphasised that nurturing care and responsive caregiving are critical to the wellbeing of every preterm or LBW infant and should be implemented regardless of the type of feeding regime.

In preterm infants, including those < 32 weeks gestation or < 1.5 kg who need to be fed by an alternate feeding method to breast-feeding (e.g. gastric tube feeding or cup feeding), a conditional recommendation based on moderate-certainty evidence was made that feeding advancement may be increased by volumes up to 30 ml/kg per day. Evidence of moderate benefits was found on time to regain birth weight (high certainty), decreased length of hospital stay and decrease in apnoea (moderate certainty) in trials (n = 12) of infants < 37 weeks gestation or < 2.5 kg birth weight, including 6 trials in infants < 32 weeks or < 1.5 kg. The evidence on harm of neurodevelopmental disability was considered to be low certainty. All trials compared fast advancement (increments of 30–40 ml/kg per day) with slow advancement (increments of 10–25 ml/kg per day). The GDG took the conservative value of 30 ml/kg per day as the threshold for fast feed advancement, consistent with many national guidelines.

### Risk-adjusted / neuroprotective care services in the NICU: the elemental role of the neonatal therapist (OT, PT, SLP) [^116hDTob]. Journal of Perinatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Elemental roles of the neonatal therapist

Defining the necessary components required to provide risk-adjusted age-appropriate neonatal care for complex and critically ill infants will facilitate implementation of standardized care practices consistent with the central tenets of developmental care philosophy and the demonstrable effect on perinatal outcomes. The American Occupational Therapy Association (AOTA), American Physical Therapy Association (APTA), American Speech–Language–Hearing Association (ASHA) define the NICU as a specialized practice setting due to the medical and developmental fragility of the infants, the vulnerable emotional status of the families, and the intricacy of medical, cultural, and social factors that impact the family-infant unit. NTs apply knowledge of neonatal medical conditions, intensive care equipment, preterm infant development and necessary handling precautions, and family system dynamics to contribute to the development of a collaborative management plan that promotes age-appropriate infant neurobehavioral organization and interactions. Interventions provided by NTs optimize long-term development, prevent adverse sequelae, nurture the infant-family dyad, and support education needs of the family and NICU team.

In accordance with the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), NTs contribute to the provision of care in each of the four levels of nurseries as defined below:
Level I well newborn nurseries (WNNs) provide basic routine care including state-mandated newborn assessment, management of minor medical problems, and screenings and medical stabilization to prepare for transport when needed for low risk, full-term, and late-preterm infants born 35–37 weeks gestational age.
Level II special care nurseries (SCN) provide intermediate level care for moderately preterm infants born at greater than or equal to 32 weeks gestational age with birth weight greater than 1500 g or management of full-term infants requiring careful postnatal monitoring, IV antibiotics, or short-term respiratory support.
Level III or IV NICUs provide a full range of subspecialty staffing with advanced diagnostic imaging and respiratory support equipment adequate to provide the highest-level intensive care services for critically ill infants of all viable gestational ages. Level IV NICUs additionally provide requisite surgical subspecialties for surgical repair of complex conditions as well as a full range capacity of respiratory support including extracorporeal mechanical oxygenation.

### Changes in the body weight of term infants, born in the tropics, during the first seven days of life [^116fsExv]. BMC Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Each year four million neonates die, the majority in the first week of life. Most deaths occur in the developing world and are due to neonatal sepsis, birth complications and prematurity. To have any hope of achieving the 4th Millennium development goal (a two third reduction of deaths in children less than five years of age), a decrease in the number of neonatal deaths must occur. Assessing a neonate for signs of illness is often subjective. An unwell neonate can have subtle signs which can be missed, even by trained health care workers. Infants with neonatal sepsis can present in a number of ways: respiratory distress, temperature instability, cyanosis, hypotension, lethargy, hyperbilirubinaemia, abdominal distension, prostration, weak or absent movement, abnormally irritable or sleepy, abnormal feeding, inability to console infant, or with a bulging fontanelle. Therefore, an objective measurement of neonatal wellbeing would be an invaluable tool, especially in resource poor settings where other diagnostic capacities are limited.

It is well established that infants will lose weight in the first few days of life. Studies performed in developed countries quote a weight loss of between 4–7% in the first days of life. However, there is a paucity of data regarding weight loss in normal infants in developing countries.

Calculating weight loss or weight gain is useful in the evaluation of a neonate. For example a weight loss of greater than 10% has been associated with dehydration and hypernatremia. As part of an initial assessment, calculating whether the infant has lost more weight than would be expected for their age can guide management by objectively demonstrating at risk infants (for example infants who have lost too much weight from insufficient feeding or increases loses from diarrhoea). Calculating weight gain and comparing to expected values can aid evaluation of an infant's recovery. For these useful calculations to be made, the expected weight loss and weight gain must be known.

In conventional paediatric practice weight loss in the first seven days of life is described as a percentage loss from birth weight and weight gain as a growth velocity (g/kg/day).

The aim of this analysis was to describe the normal weight change in a breast fed infant in the first seven days of life and to evaluate whether this change was the same for normal weight infants, low birth weight infants (< 2.50 kg) and small for gestational age infants.

Consequences of Being Born SGA

Neonatal Period

Mortality risk of neonates born SGA is higher than of those born appropriate for gestational age (AGA), while neonates born both preterm and SGA have the highest risk. Approximately one-third of SGA infants experience hypoglycemia after birth. Causes for hypoglycemia include low glycogen stores and lower levels of free fatty acids and ketone bodies suggestive of reduced fat stores. They also have a higher likelihood of hypothermia compared to their AGA counterparts due to excessive heat loss through an increased body surface due to a relatively large head, increased transdermal insensible losses, and lower subcutaneous fat and reduced body fat stores. In addition, hypoglycemia can negatively affect the thermoregulatory response.

Infancy

Infants born SGA have a reduced total fat mass with a normal amount of visceral fat but a reduced amount of subcutaneous fat, causing an elevated ratio of visceral to subcutaneous fat. However, the key risk factor for developing metabolic disease in later life is not the birth size but the postnatal growth rate. Catch-up in weight and length is highest in SGA-born infants between 3 and 6 months, with higher catch-up in weight than length. Accelerated postnatal weight gain increases the long-term risk of obesity, metabolic diseases, aging and coronary vascular disease of all infants, but particularly in those born SGA (-). The increase in fat mass occurs earlier and is greater than the increase in muscle mass. In healthy catch-up growth, gain in weight, length, and lean body mass occur in parallel. Observations that weight acceleration increases the risk of metabolic disease in animals without prenatal growth restriction, and that the effects of low birth weight on the adult phenotype can be reversed by preventing accelerated postnatal weight gain, support the concept that accelerated postnatal weight gain per se is the key independent risk factor for later metabolic disease.

Neonatal and pediatric time frame for initiating PN — Begin PN promptly after birth in the very low birth weight infant (birth weight less than 1500 g). Insufficient data exist to suggest a specific time frame in which PN is ideally initiated in more mature preterm infants or critically ill term neonates. For the infant, child, or adolescent with a self-limited illness, it is reasonable to delay starting PN for 1 week; however, initiate PN within 1–3 days in infants and within 4–5 days in older children and adolescents when it is evident that they will not tolerate full oral intake or EN for an extended period.

Physical and developmental status

According to the standard growth chart, physical and developmental growth of the multiple-birth infants is a delaying growth during the first 18 months up to the normal curve (except one of them) as described below. The quintuplets were born at 29th gestational week in a hospital in Isfahan in 2018. Two of them were girls and three others were boys weighing 1300, 1100, 1000, 1120, and 1130 g respectively, and were in need of artificial ventilation and surfactant. They were discharged with gavage tubes 26 days after the delivery. Two of them were re-hospitalized for apnea and discharged again after two weeks. The physician ordered the discharge accompanied by pulse-oximeter and oxygen cylinder enabling the parents to monitor and regulate the infants' oxygen saturation at home. The 24-years-old mother of quadruplets, under medical treatments, delivered her infants through cesarean at 32nd gestational week in a hospital in Isfahan in 2019. They weighed 1370, 1210, 1170, and 1530 g and all of them were discharged two weeks after the delivery. The first home care and visit was performed few weeks after the discharge. However, special cares were given either on site or through phone calls. The infants were under regular and periodic care and treatment and were followed up for developmental growth for two years. Both family and healthcare team tried to maintain physical growth, weight gain, and some of the physiological indicators at an optimal level. According to the growth curve, the weight gains of the infants were between 40 to 50% in the growth chart. The average weight of the infants was 1130 g at the delivery time, 1930 g after 40 days, 5412 g after 6 months, 7820 g after one year, 11,800 g at the age of 2, and 13,400 g at the age of 3 (Figs. 2, 3, 4, 5).

Breastfeeding infant jaundice — post-discharge follow-up prioritizes timely review and protection of breastfeeding: most infants discharged before 72 hours of age should be seen by a healthcare provider within 2 days of discharge from birth hospitalization. This is especially important for exclusively breastfed infants, and close follow-up of the breastfeeding newborn both facilitates prevention of excess weight loss that may contribute to hyperbilirubinemia and ensures that elevated bilirubin concentrations are promptly treated. Do not supplement with anything other than mother's own expressed milk in the absence of a specific clinical indication.

### Clinical practice guideline revision: management of hyperbilirubinemia in the newborn infant 35 or more weeks of gestation [^114nE3J6]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Postdischarge follow-up for hyperbilirubinemia — timing and testing are guided by using the difference between the bilirubin concentration and the phototherapy threshold at the time of measurement to determine the interval between discharge and follow-up and the need for additional total serum bilirubin (TSB) or transcutaneous bilirubin (TcB) measurements. This approach incorporates both gestational age and other hyperbilirubinemia neurotoxicity risk factors into the decision-making process, and should also take into consideration the presence of other hyperbilirubinemia risk factors. These guidelines are based only on the management of hyperbilirubinemia, and other considerations that may influence the timing of follow-up include gestational age, postnatal age, assessment of breastfeeding, weight loss from birth weight, and assessment of the well-being of the infant and parents.

### ABM clinical protocol # 1: guidelines for glucose monitoring and treatment of hypoglycemia in term and late preterm neonates, revised 2021 [^115Cf3V2]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2021). High credibility.

ABM Clinical Protocol #1 — risk factors and monitoring guidance note that neonates at increased risk for developing neonatal hypoglycemia should be routinely monitored for blood glucose beginning within the window of feeding, and at-risk neonates fall into two categories: excessive utilization of glucose (hyperinsulinemic states) and inadequate production or substrate delivery. Large for gestational age infants born to screened nondiabetic mothers appear not at risk of hypoglycemia nor at increased risk of poor psychomotor development at 4 years of age. Umbilical cord blood glucose does not seem to predict early hypoglycemia. Infants appropriate for gestational age by weight but with low body fat percentage are at risk for hypoglycemia, whereas constitutionally small babies with adequate fat stores are not. Early feeding improves breastfeeding, but results are contradictory as to whether it improves blood glucose, and confounding may contribute because a baby with borderline low blood glucose may not feed well.

### Latin American consensus: children born small for gestational age [^114sKAUx]. BMC Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Low birth weight (< 2500 g) is prevalent in many countries and poses a significant public health problem contributing to a variety of short- and long-term negative effects. While about half of low-birth-weight infants in the industrialized world are born preterm (< 37 weeks' gestation), most of these infants are born full term in the rest of the world. The United Nations Children's Fund State of the World's Children Report, 2003, noted a 14% overall world prevalence of low birth weight, with the highest prevalence of low birth weight in South Asia (26%), with rates of 14% in developing countries, 9% in Latin America and the Caribbean (Table 1). About two-thirds of births in parts of Asia, Africa, and Latin America go unreported because many deliveries occur in small clinics or private homes, hence, it is logical to assume that the number of low-weight births is also underreported.

Higher rates of morbidity and mortality are more likely in children of low birth weight or born small for gestational age (SGA) than children born appropriate for gestational age (AGA). Hence, it is imperative to begin managing the health care of these children as early as possible to achieve optimal outcomes.

The development of the 2007 consensus statement on the management of children born SGA by the International Societies of Pediatric Endocrinology and the Growth Hormone Research Society prompted leading experts to develop a similar consensus statement for Latin America. They held the first meeting in Lima, Peru, in October 2008, where three working groups discussed key issues to address within the consensus, specifically regarding the evaluation and management of children born SGA within Latin America. In March, 2009, the group met in Prague, Czech Republic, to further discuss and agree on the elements of a consensus document. Shortly thereafter, a consensus report was produced, which is presented here in final form. This paper presents a summary of the key issues discussed at the conferences regarding the clinical identification and optimal management of children born SGA.

ABM Clinical Protocol #12 — Postdischarge assessment emphasizes early follow-up, growth monitoring, and feeding evaluation. Nutrition monitoring should occur as early as possible, preferably within 72 hours. Intake assessment includes taking a detailed feeding history on expressed human milk versus direct breastfeeding, pumping, and any fortified human milk or formula, and clinicians should consider screening for postpartum depression. Anthropometrics should be obtained by measuring weight, length, and head circumference, with length measured using a stadiometer. Growth data should be plotted on appropriate growth curves, preferably the INTERGROWTH-21st Postnatal Growth of Preterm Infants charts until 64 weeks' PMA, with Fenton and Olsen charts acceptable until 50 weeks' PMA; after 64 or 50 weeks, use the World Health Organization growth charts.

### Postnatal weight increase and growth velocity of very low birthweight infants [^117FfZun]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Only a few studies have dealt with postnatal growth velocity of very low birthweight (VLBW) infants.

Objective

To analyse weight growth kinetics of VLBW infants from birth to over 2 years of age.

Patients

A total of 262 VLBW infants were selected; inaccurate estimate of gestational age, major congenital anomalies, necrotising enterocolitis, death, and loss to follow up within the first year were the exclusion criteria.

Methods

Body weight was recorded daily up to 28 days or up to discontinuation of parenteral nutrition, weekly up to discharge, then at 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 months of corrected age. Individual growth profiles were fitted with a seven constant, exponential-logistic function suitable for modelling weight loss and weight recovery, two peaks, and the subsequent slow decrease in growth velocity.

Results

After a postnatal weight loss, all infants showed a late neonatal peak of growth velocity between the 7th and 21st weeks; most also experienced an early neonatal peak between the 2nd and 6th week. VLBW infants who were small for gestational age and those with major morbidities grew less than reference VLBW infants who were the appropriate size for gestational age without major morbidities: at 2 years of age, the difference in weight was about 860 g. The more severe growth impairment seen in VLBW infants with major morbidities is almost entirely due to the reduced height of the late neonatal peak of velocity.

Conclusions

The growth model presented here should be a useful tool for evaluating to what extent different pathological conditions or nutritional and medical care protocols affect growth kinetics.

### Preterm infant (VLBW) enteral nutrition guideline (2017–2020) [^112pc6fq]. AND (2020). High credibility.

VLBW: Human milk fortification — Healthcare practitioners should fortify human milk fed to very low birth weight preterm infants because fortification increases weight gain and head circumference growth compared to human milk alone; the recommendation carries Rating: Weak and is labeled Imperative. Very low birth weight (VLBW) preterm infants receiving human milk fortification in comparison to human milk alone experienced improved growth in hospital (weight gain and head circumference) and post discharge (weight, length, and head circumference). No potential risks or harms (including necrotizing enterocolitis) were identified with human milk fortification. Health care practitioners should use professional expertise and individual assessment to select an appropriate human milk fortifier. Implementation considerations include: Consider offering human milk fortification to VLBW; preterm infants to improve growth, evaluate commercially available human milk fortifiers and consider stocking one or more to add to expressed human milk, provide a suitable area and staff education for safe handling and preparation of enteral feedings, and encourage the development of a feeding protocol that is accepted and used by key stakeholders in the NICU and that specifies when human milk fortification is started, how it is advanced and when it is stopped. There is variability in the cost of available human milk fortifiers.

### International consensus guideline on small for gestational age: etiology and management from infancy to early adulthood [^112EtZHi]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Growth

As a group, children born SGA do not achieve their genetic height potential, falling on average 1 SD below mid-parental height/target height. At least 90% of children born SGA show spontaneous catch-up growth into the normal height range (> −2 SDS) during childhood. Catch-up growth is generally defined as a sustained growth rate (cm/year) > 0 SDS, that is, more than the median for chronological age and sex. Sufficient catch-up is arbitrarily defined as growing into the normal height range. This process is more pronounced during the first 6 months and usually completed within the first 2 years of life, in which 85% of children show catch-up growth to a normal length. Catch-up might take longer in infants born preterm and SGA, up to the age of 4 years. Children born SGA with a height below −2 SDS at the age of 3 years, have a 7-fold increased risk of remaining short, whereas those born SGA with a birth weight below −2 SDS have a 5-fold increased risk. The reasons for insufficient catch-up growth in children born SGA are poorly understood. Factors that positively influence childhood growth include female sex, multiple birth, taller parents, and more rapid gain in length during early life.

### Discharge age and weight for very preterm infants: 2005–2018 [^115m5fLK]. Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

A complex set of medical, social, and financial factors underlie decisions to discharge very preterm infants. As care practices change, whether postmenstrual age and weight at discharge have changed is unknown.

Methods

Between 2005 and 2018, 824 US Vermont Oxford Network member hospitals reported 314811 infants 24 to 29 weeks' gestational age at birth without major congenital abnormalities who survived to discharge from the hospital. Using quantile regression, adjusting for infant characteristics and complexity of hospital course, we estimated differences in median age, weight, and discharge weight z score at discharge stratified by gestational age at birth and by NICU type.

Results

From 2005 to 2018, postmenstrual age at discharge increased an estimated 8 (compatibility interval [CI]: 8 to 9) days for all infants. For infants initially discharged from the hospital, discharge weight increased an estimated 316 (CI: 308 to 324) grams, and median discharge weight z score increased an estimated 0.19 (CI: 0.18 to 0.20) standard units. Increases occurred within all birth gestational ages and across all NICU types. The proportion of infants discharged home from the hospital on human milk increased, and the proportions of infants discharged home from the hospital on oxygen or a cardiorespiratory monitor decreased.

Conclusions

Gestational age and weight at discharge increased steadily from 2005 to 2018 for survivors 24 to 29 weeks' gestation with undetermined causes, benefits, and costs.

### Real-world evidence regarding the growth of very premature infants with small for gestational age after birth: a multicenter survey in China [^115k1Ku5]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

With an increase in the understanding of short-term and long-term health-influencing factors that affect SGA, the perinatal medical community has focused on the prevention and management of nutrition of SGA infants. Regarding the incidence of SGA, China (6.5% incidence) ranks fifth globally (16% incidence). In 2016, the WHO defined SGA as a newborn whose birth weight is below the 10 th percentile of the birth weight for infants of the same sex of the same gestational age or whose Z-value of birth weight is < –1.28. The Fenton growth curve (2013) is used for the diagnosis of SGA. SGA can be divided into premature SGA, full-term SGA, and overdue SGA, among which premature SGA is affected by intrauterine growth retardation and immature gestational age. The risk of early complications after birth and perinatal death increases, and it can also lead to many long-term complications such as adult cardiovascular diseases, insulin resistance, and neurocognitive dysfunction, which increases the burden on society and families.

Guellec et al. established a correlation between postnatal growth impairment in infants with SGA and cognitive deficits and learning difficulties. This finding has been supported by additional studies. For example, in their publication in the Journal of Pediatrics, Kerstjens et al. discovered a connection between postnatal growth impairment in SGA infants and delayed intellectual development and learning difficulties. Euser et al. also identified an association between postnatal growth impairment in SGA infants and behavioral and emotional problems. These research outcomes emphasize the significance of monitoring and intervening in the postnatal growth of SGA infants to mitigate the occurrence of extrauterine growth restriction (EUGR) and enhance their neurodevelopment and growth. Currently, there is no international consensus regarding the optimal postnatal growth pattern for preterm SGA infants. It is imperative to closely monitor the growth pattern of preterm newborns to detect any deviations from the norm. Early and appropriate catch-up growth plays a beneficial role in the physical growth and neurodevelopment of SGA children. Therefore, it is essential to develop reliable methods for accurately identifying infants with genuine extrauterine growth restriction, comprehending the factors influencing the occurrence of EUGR, and providing adequate and appropriate nutrition. These measures are crucial for ensuring successful catch-up growth.

### Discharge age and weight for very preterm infants in six countries: 2012–2020 [^11459Ryu]. Neonatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Postmenstrual age for surviving infants without congenital anomalies born at 24–29 weeks' gestational age from 2005 to 2018 in the USA increased 8 days, discharge weight increased 316 grams, and median discharge weight z-score increased 0.19 standard units. We asked whether increases were observed in other countries.

Methods

We evaluated postmenstrual age, weight, and weight z-score at discharge of surviving infants without congenital anomalies born at 24–29 weeks' gestational age admitted to Vermont Oxford Network member hospitals in Austria, Ireland, Italy, Switzerland, the UK, and the USA from 2012 to 2020.

Results

After adjustment, the median postmenstrual age at discharge increased significantly in Austria (3.6 days, 99% CI [1.0, 6.3]), Italy (4.0 days [2.3, 5.6]), and the USA (5.4 days [5.0, 5.8]). Median discharge weight increased significantly in Austria (181 grams, 99% CI [95, 267]), Ireland (234 [143, 325]), Italy (133 [83, 182]), and the USA (207 [194, 220]). Median discharge weight z-score increased in Ireland (0.24 standard units, 99% CI [0.12, 0.36]) and the USA (0.15 [0.13, 0.16]). Discharge on human milk increased in Italy, Switzerland, and the UK, while going home on cardiorespiratory monitors decreased in Austria, Ireland, and USA and going home on oxygen decreased in Ireland.

Conclusions

In this international cohort of neonatal intensive care units, postmenstrual discharge age and weight increased in some, but not all, countries. Processes of care at discharge did not change in conjunction with age and weight increases.

Outpatient follow-up for late preterm and early term infants — initial visit assessment: Although timing of length of hospital stay may vary, these infants require close follow-up in the early postpartum period and the first follow-up appointment or home health visit should normally occur 1 or 2 days after hospital discharge. The visit should review prenatal, parental, infant, and feeding history; review feeding since discharge with attention to frequency, duration, and any supplementation; obtain information about stool and urine output and infant behavior and review any written feeding record; examine the infant, obtain an accurate naked weight, and calculate percentage change from birth and from discharge; assess for jaundice with a transcutaneous bilirubin screening device and/or serum bilirubin determination if indicated; whenever possible, observe a breastfeed to evaluate latch, suck, and swallow; caution mothers not to taper expressing sessions too rapidly; and review safe sleeping practices.

### Growth trajectory of full-term small-for-gestational-age infants: a 3-year longitudinal study in China [^112gf8gZ]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2024). High credibility.

SGA infants require good monitoring and management, especially in those with rapid catch-up weight growth, tend to have a higher risk of obesity and metabolic syndromes later in life and therefore require early identification and early intervention. The Latin American expert consensus recommends following up by measuring length and weight every 3 months within 1 year of age and every 6 months between 1 and 2 years of age. In the area where this study was conducted, SGA infants were managed as high-risk children that should be closely monitored. Health professionals in the tertiary network of monitoring, that is, city-county-community healthcare centres, routinely follow up these infants at birth and at 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, 30 and 36 months. We suggested that health professionals, including clinicians and nurses, make accurate measurement of length and weight for full-term SGA infants at each follow-up and draw growth curves of both length and weight. By doing so, both health professionals and parents would be alerted immediately when suboptimal growth trajectory occurs, for instance, the rapid weight gain. Health professionals should pay more attention to the weight and length growth in girls. Findings in this study could be interpreted into health management for the full-term SGA infants by developing age-specific and gender-specific interventions.

### Place of birth and variations in management of late preterm ("near-term") infants [^116e1QxZ]. Seminars in Perinatology (2006). Low credibility.

Background

The purpose of this study is to characterize variations in management late preterm infants because such variations in such a large group of neonates would have economic and health implications.

Methods

Comparison of the use of illustrative management approaches and gestational age at discharge among infants born at 33 to 34 6/7 weeks and discharged alive from 10 Massachusetts and California NICUs.

Results

Generally similar in birth weight and admission severity, significant differences were seen in illustrative interventions, such as the use of mechanical ventilation (range in use across hospitals from 9% to 43%) and nutritional practices (use of hyperalimentation ranged from 5% to 66%). Variations in average daily weight gain were seen with some infants averaging net losses. Postmenstrual age at discharge varied by a week between the hospital with the earliest discharge and that with the latest.

Conclusions

Care for these infants would be improved by further examination of their needs and the establishment of practice guidelines to reduce unneeded variation.

### The impact of level of neonatal care provision on outcomes for preterm babies born between 27 and 31 weeks of gestation, or with a birth weight between 1, 000 and 1500 g: a review of the literature [^1158ZiPT]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2020). High credibility.

Methods

Criteria for considering studies

Our aim was to identify studies comparing outcomes for babies born between 27 and 31 weeks of gestation by the designation of neonatal unit linked to the maternity services where the baby was born or subsequently cared for (NICU vs non-NICU setting). To ensure we were not excluding evidence from studies published before the 1980sand from countries which categorised babies by birth weight as opposed to gestational age, we also included studies comparing outcomes for babies with a birth weight between 1000 and 1500 g. Of the commonly used birth weight stratifications, this weight range best aligned with the 50th centile for weight for preterm babies born between 27 and 31 weeks of gestation (see online supplementary figure S1).

Literature search

We conducted a search in Embase, Medline and CINAHL databases (1977–2018), using terms related to our patient group (including 'newborn, neonate, premature, preterm, infant, low birth weight'), intervention (including 'regionalisation, centralisation, level of care, size, volume, maternal/neonatal transfer, inborn, outborn') and outcomes (including 'mortality, morbidity, death, survival'). We did not specify specific morbidities within our search strategy (for the full search strategy, see online supplementary figure S2). Articles were analysed by AQTI and TP, with EMB arbitrating any differences of opinion as to suitability for inclusion. Study authors were contacted for further information if the gestational age range contained or overlapped with, but was not exactly 27 to 31 weeks, or outcome data were in a non-numerical format. The reference lists of articles retrieved from the search, and three systematic reviews on this topic were analysed, as well as a search for relevant 'grey' literature (including research and industry reports, conference proceedings, theses, preprints, etc) in OpenGrey, Scopus, Embase and Web of Science databases (1977–2018). All searches were limited to the English language.

Analysis

To determine the feasibility of meta-analysis, we assessed articles included in the systematic review for uniformity of study characteristics, patient populations, and outcome measures. We assessed risk of bias in included studies using a modified version of the QUIPS (QUality In Prognostic Studies) tool.

### Body composition from birth to 2 years [^113RbkvG]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2024). Medium credibility.

Greater clarity regarding growth is not without its challenges

Assessment of growth in early life has many unique challenges, particularly given the assortment of intra-uterine and neonatal factors modulating fetal growth and tissue accretion at birth and into the early post-partum period. Rapid fetal body composition changes late in a normal pregnancy include gains in both lean and adipose tissue, and weight.

Birth is characterized by fundamental changes in physiology and metabolism as the new-born adapts to an independent extra-uterine environment high in oxygen. Marked changes in weight and composition in the first 72 h of life include changes in the extracellular space, TBW and water levels in tissue fractions. For example, hydration of the FFM can decrease by about 5% across the first year of life and relative fat mass (%FM) changes from approximately 11–15% at birth to 30% at 6 months. This multiplies the potential complications in the accurate monitoring of growth and body composition during infancy.

As mentioned earlier, the prevention of chronic disease in later life, including co-morbidities of obesity, would greatly benefit from the ability to quantify body composition and track change over time. A better understanding of the specific contribution of intrauterine and post-natal periods to increased adiposity would be a significant advance. Another major advantage of detailed assessments of body composition during the early years would be to quantify the impact of interventions in this age group. Likewise, it is important to focus more attention on premature infants whose growth is frequently stunted during the early postnatal period. Although discharge weights and term-corrected statistics from around the world indicate that preterm babies typically make up for lost growth and catch up to their full-term counterparts, there is insufficient understanding of how FM and FFM contribute to this atypical growth pattern. Given the link between infant body composition in early life and cardiovascular, metabolic, and neurological outcomes, comprehending this process is crucial.

A major evidence gap in the field is the lack of a comprehensive understanding of variability in growth between populations. Primarily, this shortcoming stems from the traditional bias for data collection in high-income countries. Under normal, healthy or 'ideal conditions', infancy is a period of rapid linear growth with proportionate increases in FM and FFM.

### Growth of preterm very low birth weight infants discharged with weight of less than 1500grams [^117BdhAa]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

It was estimated in 2015 that approximately 20.5million babies were born with low birth weight and the majority 91% occurred in low and middle-income countries. Low birth weight babies account for 80% of global neonatal deaths of these two-thirds are preterm. Surviving preterm and low birth weight babies have been observed to be at risk for morbidities ranging from stunting, ill-health, and adult-onset chronic conditions like cardiovascular diseases among others. Low birth weight (LBW) has been associated with the loss of human capital through an increase in high school dropout rate, lowering labor force participation, and early aging.

One of the concerns among surviving preterm infants is their growth and its health implications. Various studies have demonstrated that poor growth among preterm very low birth weight infants (VLBW) is associated with poor neurodevelopmental outcomes hence emphasizing the need for promotion and maintaining close to normal early growth among these infants. Nutrition among these infants aims to mimic normal fetal growth to promote development.

In the developed countries preterm and VLBW infants are commenced on parenteral nutrition early in life and once on full feeds, their nutritional requirements are adjusted to meet the European Society Paediatric Gastroenterology Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPHAGAN) recommendations. In Low and Middle-income Countries (LMIC) the WHO (world Health Organization) guideline on the feeding of LBW infants is followed, this guideline follows weight gain to decide the next appropriate intervention.

At the Mulago National referral hospital, VLBW infants do not routinely receive parenteral nutrition and are discharged home early due to lack of space in the hospital. Parents are educated on how to gavage and breastfeed their infants. Feeding and weight gain are reviewed weekly. Escalation of feeding to fortified breast milk does not happen even among poorly growing LBW infants due to cost and availability.

A previous follow-up of LBW infants at Mulago hospital kangaroo clinic observed the majority of babies not recovering birth weight by 21 days of life. We describe here the growth among a cohort of VLBW infants discharged with a weight of < 1500 g from the Mulago Special Care Baby Unit (SCBU) over the first 12 weeks post-discharge to guide post-discharge follow-up for such infants.

### Gestational weight gain standards based on women enrolled in the fetal growth longitudinal study of the INTERGROWTH-21st project: a prospective longitudinal cohort study [^116DBmB3]. BMJ (2016). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Associations between insufficient or excessive gestational weight gain (GWG) and short and long term maternal and child health outcomes are well described. Insufficient weight gain has been linked with increased risks of low birth weight, small for gestational age, and preterm birth, while excessive gain has been associated with large for gestational age, gestational diabetes, preterm birth, caesarean section, infant mortality, postpartum weight retention, and childhood obesity. Pregnant women are therefore routinely weighed in clinical settings. The benefits of doing so, however, are debatable in the absence of appropriate guidelines or even agreement on what constitutes adequate weight gain.

In 1970, the Institute of Medicine/National Research Council reviewed the available evidence on GWG that resulted in good pregnancy outcomes, with subsequent revisions in 1990 and 2009. The latest guidelines evaluated the trade offs between maternal and child health outcomes and weight gain during pregnancy, including the risks of small for gestational age and preterm birth with inadequate GWG and the increased rates of caesarean section and postpartum weight retention with excessive GWG. Based on a recent systematic review, however, these guidelines were all derived from country specific studies that varied in sample selection, study design, and methods of data collection and statistical analysis. In the United Kingdom, "routine weighing during pregnancy should be confined to circumstances in which clinical management is likely to be influenced". In countries where routine weighing is recommended, most current guidelines are based on relating observed GWG to pregnancy outcomes and then determining the range of weight gain with the lowest perinatal risk, although other authors have attempted to select populations with good perinatal outcomes and then retrospectively determine the associated GWG range.

The World Health Organization recommends that a reference for GWG be based on prospective longitudinal studies of selected populations with a low incidence of maternal and fetal complications, where anthropometric measures are collected before and during pregnancy and postpartum. The same "prescriptive" approach was adopted by WHO in producing international growth standards for children aged 0–5 years that have now been adopted by more than 125 countries worldwide, and by the International Fetal and Newborn Growth (INTERGROWTH-21 st) Consortium for the 21 st Century in producing standards for early pregnancy dating, fetal growth, newborn size, and postnatal growth for preterm infants. We examined data on GWG obtained, according to WHO recommendations, from healthy pregnant women who were free from identifiable major medical, nutritional, or social and major environmental risk factors. The women had pregnancies with good maternal and perinatal outcomes. Based on these data, we report GWG patterns from normal weight women.

### Early discharge with home support of gavage feeding for stable preterm infants who have not established full oral feeds [^115akCqH]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Early discharge of stable preterm infants still requiring gavage feeds offers the benefits of uniting families sooner and reducing healthcare and family costs compared with discharge home when on full sucking feeds. Potential disadvantages of early discharge include increased care burden for the family and risk of complications related to gavage feeding.

Objectives

To determine the effects of a policy of early discharge of stable preterm infants with home support of gavage feeding compared with a policy of discharge of such infants when they have reached full sucking feeds. We planned subgroup analyses to determine whether safety and efficacy outcomes are altered by the type of support received (outpatient visits vs home support) or by the maturity of the infants discharged (gestational age ≤ 28 weeks at birth or birth weight ≤ 1000 grams).

Search Methods

We used the standard search strategy of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group, together with searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2015, Issue 3), the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) (1982 to March 2015), EMBASE (1980 to March 2015) and MEDLINE (1950 to March 2015). We found no new trials.

Selection Criteria

We included all randomised and quasi-randomised trials among infants born at < 37 weeks and requiring no intravenous nutrition at the point of discharge. Trials were required to compare early discharge home with gavage feeds and healthcare support versus later discharge home when full sucking feeds were attained.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We conducted study authors for additional information. We performed data analysis in accordance with the standards of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group.

Main Results

We included in the review data from one quasi-randomised trial with 88 infants from 75 families. Infants in the early discharge programme with home gavage feeding had a mean hospital stay that was 9.3 days shorter (mean difference (MD) -9.3, 95% confidence interval (CI) -18.49 to -0.11) than that of infants in the control group. Infants in the early discharge programme also had lower risk of clinical infection during the home gavage period compared with those in the control group spending corresponding time in hospital (risk ratio 0.35, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.69). No significant differences were noted between groups in duration and extent of breast feeding, weight gain, re-admission within the first 12 months post discharge from the home gavage programme or from hospital, scores reflecting parental satisfaction or overall health service use.

Authors' Conclusions

Experimental evidence on the benefits and risks for preterm infants of early discharge from hospital with home gavage feeding compared with later discharge upon attainment of full sucking feeds is limited to the results of one small quasi-randomised controlled trial. High-quality trials with concealed allocation, complete follow-up of all randomly assigned infants and adequate sample size are needed before practice recommendations can be made.

Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine Clinical Protocol #2 — risks for early breastfeeding cessation — All concerns such as nipple pain, inability to express milk, perception of inadequate production, and any perceived need to supplement should be promptly evaluated and addressed; in countries where discharge after birth hospitalization typically occurs by 1.5–2 days after a vaginal birth and 2–4 days after a cesarean section, newborn weight and weight loss percentiles or percentages should be assessed, the frequency of assessment will depend on anticipated timing of discharge and national recommendations, and discharge may need to be delayed if the newborn's weight loss is higher than expected and a safe and sustainable feeding and follow-up plan is not feasible. Levels of evidence: 2, 3. Strength of recommendation: B.

Evidence synthesis — higher vs lower AA dose in parenteral nutrition for preterm infants showed similar growth outcomes early, at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age or discharge, and at 2 years. Early outcomes were similar for maximum percentage weight loss from birth weight (MD = 0.63; 95% CI, −0.48 to 1.75; P = 0.26) and days to regain birth weight (MD = −0.72, 95% CI, −1.59 to 0.14; P = 0.11).

### Poor birth weight recovery among low birth weight / preterm infants following hospital discharge in Kampala, Uganda [^1124xxLS]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The prevalence of low birth weight (LBW) deliveries is higher in developing countries than developed countries and is associated with increased risks of poor health outcomes. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines LBW as the weight of live born infants less than 2,500 grams. The condition can be due to premature birth or intrauterine growth restriction or both. Low birth weight, which is approximately equivalent to preterm birth, is an important predictor of infant death within 28 days of birth. It is estimated that LBW infants are approximately 13 times more likely to die than heavier babies. Countries, such as Uganda, with higher rates of preterm delivery have higher rates of infant mortality.

More than 20 million infants worldwide are born with LBW with the majority (95.6%) born in developing countries, mainly South Asia and Sub Saharan Africa. Globally, there has been increasing awareness of specialized care required for LBW infants due to advances in Neonatal-Perinatal medicine. However, instituting this specialized care is still a challenge in developing countries. Almost 4 million deaths occur in the first month of life especially among the LBW infants. Although in many African countries birth weight is rarely recorded, in the sub-Saharan region estimates of LBW are around 14.3 percent, which is almost double the frequency in European countries. Saving newborn life is necessary in order to improve child health, reduce infant mortality rate and to attain Millennium Development goal IV in many developing countries. Providing extra support to LBW infants regarding feeding, warmth and growth monitoring has great potential to reduce neonatal mortality rate and promote survival with good quality of life.

Growth assessment in the neonatal period is determined by changes in anthropometric measurements and consistent weight gain is a valuable guide indicating adequate growth. The change in weight during the neonatal period of LBW infants is characterized by an initial loss of approximately 8–15% of the birth weight in the first 7 days following delivery and thereafter recovery occurs within 10 to 21 days. Postnatal weight loss in the early neonatal period is greater in very LBW (weigh 1000–1500 grams) and extreme LBW (weigh less than 1000 grams) infants, although considerable variation occurs among individual infants. Growth delay or failure to regain birth weight may occur due to prevailing postnatal care practices and/or various factors, which may be medically, nutritionally or environmentally related. It has been reported that infants with extreme low birth weight are more susceptible to all of the possible complications of premature birth, both in the immediate neonatal period and after discharge from the nursery.

### When is parenteral nutrition appropriate? [^114GBx3w]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2017). Medium credibility.

Neonatal parenteral nutrition (PN) considerations — Recommendation 1C highlight limited nutrient stores and high growth energy needs in neonates; therefore, constant attention to providing adequate energy is required and, if sufficient intake cannot be provided via enteral nutrition (EN), then PN is warranted. Infants with congenital gastrointestinal disorders requiring surgery may not receive EN before 2 weeks of age and may not reach full EN until after 2 months of age, supporting the need for PN in this setting. Evidence notes the very low birth weight population (birth weight less than 1500 g) and that limited data suggest benefit in short-term growth by providing PN soon after birth in more mature preterm infants. Additional supportive statements include that PN promotes an anabolic state in the neonate and is a mitigating factor of poor growth in infants born with congenital heart disease.

### Trajectories of length, weight, and bone mineral density among preterm infants during the first 12 months of corrected age in China [^116NUoAj]. BMC Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Our study showed growth peaks in length and weight at 1–3 months, which has important clinical implications. Evidence has shown that higher weight gain before term or before discharge was significantly associated with better neurodevelopmental and growth outcomes in later life, while extrauterine growth restriction during the first few days was recognized as a risk factor for poor neurodevelopmental outcomes. Thus, clinical practices have been focused on nutritional support before and after the discharge of preterm infants. Randomized trials showed that when compared to a standard formula, a postdischarge formula rich in protein, calcium, phosphorus, and vitamin D could improve growth and mineralization at term, 4 months, and 6 months. Our study indicated that nutrition support at 1–3 months of corrected age should be paid more attention as well. Whether growth rate during this critical period is associated with growth in later life warrants further investigation.

Given that there are several determinants of preterm birth and growth patterns of preterm infants might differ across these determinants, parameters such as very low birth weight and small for gestational age (SGA) have been used to discern which infants might have intrauterine growth restriction. Our study showed that SGA was associated with lower weight, length, and BMD, which is consistent with previous studies. We further showed that gestational age and birth weight were independently associated with growth of the infants, indicating that both gestational age and birth weight are important parameters characterizing preterm infants.

With the popularity of DEXA as an accurate and noninvasive method, BMD has been more widely used to assess deficiency of calcium and phosphorus. Our previous study including 11,898 full term infants has provided reference values of lumbar BMD for healthy Chinese children aged 0 to 3 years. Our current study not only showed that BMD of preterm infants was lower than that of full term peers, it also provided reference values during the first year for preterm infants. Interestingly, in contrast to the decreasing growth rate of length and weight from full term to 12 months, growth rate of BMD did not slow down with age. It could be that slower growth rate of length and weight is beneficial to the accumulation of minerals in the bone.

### Outcomes of extremely preterm infants with birth weight less than 400 G [^117VyuQU]. JAMA Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Importance

Birth weight (BW) is an important predictor of mortality and morbidity. At extremely early gestational ages (GAs), BW may influence decisions regarding initiation of resuscitation.

Objective

To characterize outcomes of liveborn infants with a BW less than 400 g.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This retrospective multicenter cohort study analyzed extremely preterm infants born between January 2008 and December 2016 within the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Neonatal Research Network. Infants with a BW less than 400 g and a GA of 22 to 26 weeks were included. Active treatment was defined as the provision of any potentially lifesaving intervention after birth. Survival was analyzed for the entire cohort; neurodevelopmental impairment (NDI) was examined for those born between January 2008 and December 2015 (birth years with outcomes available for analysis). Neurodevelopmental impairment at 18 to 26 months' corrected age (CA) was defined as a Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, Third Edition, cognitive composite score less than 85, a motor composite score less than 85, moderate or severe cerebral palsy, gross motor function classification system score of 2 or greater, bilateral blindness, and/or hearing impairment. Data were analyzed from September 2017 to October 2018.

Exposures

Birth weight less than 400 g.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was survival to discharge among infants who received active treatment. Analysis of follow-up data was limited to infants born from 2008 to 2015 to ensure children had reached assessment age. Within this cohort, neurodevelopmental outcomes were assessed for infants who survived to 18 to 26 months' CA and returned for a comprehensive visit.

Results

Of the 205 included infants, 121 (59.0%) were female, 133 (64.9%) were singletons, and 178 (86.8%) were small for gestational age. Almost half (101 of 205 [49.3%]) received active treatment at birth. A total of 26 of 205 infants (12.7%; 95% CI, 8.5–18.9) overall survived to discharge, and 26 of 101 actively treated infants (25.7%; 95% CI, 17.6–35.4) survived to discharge. Within the subset of infants with a BW less than 400 g and a GA of 22 to 23 weeks, 6 of 36 actively treated infants (17%; 95% CI, 6–33) survived to discharge. Among infants born between 2008 and 2015, 23 of 90 actively treated infants (26%; 95% CI, 17–36) survived to discharge. Two infants died after discharge, and 2 were lost to follow-up. Thus, 19 of 90 actively treated infants (21%; 95% CI, 13–31) were evaluated at 18 to 26 months' CA. Moderate or severe NDI occurred in 14 of 19 infants (74%).

Conclusions and Relevance

Infants born with a BW less than 400 g are at high risk of mortality and significant morbidity. Although 21% of infants survived to 18 to 26 months' CA with active treatment, NDI was common among survivors.

The first hour of a newborn's life is fraught with difficulty. Recommendations regarding the fundamental issues of resuscitation of these infants are developed and disseminated by the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation and other organizations. However, these recommendations frequently do not address the needs of the very low birth weight infant and do not address some of the nuances that might lead to improved outcome. Improved organization and teamwork as well as improved monitoring and respiratory support can potentially improve the outcome of these infants.

Discharge planning for late preterm and early term infants — readiness and feeding plan: Assess readiness for discharge, including physiologic stability and intake exclusively at breast, or with supplemental feedings; the physiologically stable late preterm infant should be able to maintain body temperature for at least 24 hours without assistance and have a normal respiratory rate, and preferably weight should be no more than 7% below birth weight, with adequate intake should be documented by feeding volume (e.g., test weights) or infant weight (e.g., stable or increasing). Develop a discharge-feeding plan that considers method and type of feeding and volume of milk intake, communicate the plan to follow-up healthcare professionals with written communication preferable, and when breast milk transfer is low, consider test weights or frequent weight checks and ask parents to monitor and record urine and stool output.

Preterm parenteral nutrition — lipid injectable emulsion (ILE) dosing — states: To improve growth, we recommend daily advancement of ILE to a dose of 3 g/kg/day if using SO-ILE or multicomponent ILE, with quality of evidence very low and strength of recommendation strong; across studies, starting ILE doses ranged from 0.5 g/kg/day (with 2 g/kg/day commonly the higher starting dose) and the highest maximum dose was 3.8 g/kg/day, a higher starting dose was associated with a smaller postnatal weight loss, fewer infants with discharge weight in the < 10th percentile for age, and greater head size compared with lower dose; specific dose reductions of any ILE may lead to EFAD in preterm infants, and we recommend caution and close attention to ensure the provision of sufficient fatty acids to prevent an EFAD if ever considering an ILE dose reduction.

### Growth of low birth weight preterm children [^111RMjS1]. Seminars in Perinatology (2008). Low credibility.

Very low birth weight premature (VLBWPT) infants demonstrate growth patterns in the early years of life which differ from those of term and large low birth weight preterm (LBWPT) peers. Optimal post natal growth of VLBWPT children is associated with more positive later health and neurodevelopmental outcomes. The neonatologist engaged in the follow of care of VLBWPT infants after discharge from the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit should monitor over time the velocity of weight, length, head circumference and weight/length ratio utilizing appropriate growth references. VLBW children who demonstrate atypically low weight gain in the early years of life have a higher probability of less than optimal cognitive development over time, while those with excessive weight gain have a greater likelihood of later childhood and adult obesity, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Nutritional planning should provide adequate calories for gradual normalization in all growth variables, while attempting to avoid atypically low or excessive weight gain. This nutritional planning should take into account the child's genetic growth potential, small for gestational age (SGA) or at gestational age (AGA), and clinical issues such as the presence of diseases like gastroesophageal (GE) reflux or chronic lung disease. Whatever nutritional approach is used, the neonatologist in follow up should track weight, length, head circumference, and weight/length ratio and adjust the nutrition plan and caloric intake to assure gradual return to normal in all growth variables while avoiding excessive weight gain.

### Late preterm infants: morbidities, mortality, and management recommendations [^111ci93W]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Infants born between 34 weeks 0 days and 36 weeks 6 days of gestation are termed late preterm. This group accounts for the majority of premature births in the United States, with rates increasing in each of the last 3 years. This increase is significant given their large number: nearly 280,000 in 2016 alone. Late preterm infants place a significant burden on the health care and education systems because of their increased risk of morbidities and mortality compared with more mature infants. This increased risk persists past the newborn period, leading to the need for continued health monitoring throughout life.

### Monitoring the postnatal growth of preterm infants: a paradigm change [^115XZDSx]. Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

There is no consensus regarding how the growth of preterm infants should be monitored or what constitutes their ideal pattern of growth, especially after term-corrected age. The concept that the growth of preterm infants should match that of healthy fetuses is not substantiated by data and, in practice, is seldom attained, particularly for very preterm infants. Hence, by hospital discharge, many preterm infants are classified as postnatal growth-restricted. In a recent systematic review, 61 longitudinal reference charts were identified, most with considerable limitations in the quality of gestational age estimation, anthropometric measures, feeding regimens, and how morbidities were described. We suggest that the correct comparator for assessing the growth of preterm infants, especially those who are moderately or late preterm, is a cohort of preterm newborns (not fetuses or term infants) with an uncomplicated intrauterine life and low neonatal and infant morbidity. Such growth monitoring should be comprehensive, as recommended for term infants, and should include assessments of postnatal length, head circumference, weight/length ratio, and, if possible, fat and fat-free mass. Preterm postnatal growth standards meeting these criteria are now available and may be used to assess preterm infants until 64 weeks' postmenstrual age (6 months' corrected age), the time at which they overlap, without the need for any adjustment, with the World Health Organization Child Growth Standards for term newborns. Despite remaining nutritional gaps, 90% of preterm newborns (ie, moderate to late preterm infants) can be monitored by using the International Fetal and Newborn Growth Consortium for the 21st Century Preterm Postnatal Growth Standards from birth until life at home.

### Clinical practice guideline revision: management of hyperbilirubinemia in the newborn infant 35 or more weeks of gestation [^116kypNB]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Hyperbilirubinemia guideline — KAS 2 states that oral supplementation with water or dextrose water should not be provided to prevent hyperbilirubinemia or decrease bilirubin concentrations, with Aggregate Evidence Quality Grade B and a Strong Recommendation. Avoiding supplementation may help promote breastfeeding because supplementation has been associated with reduced maternal confidence in breastfeeding and breastfeeding duration, and one study found no difference in peak serum bilirubin concentrations or the need for phototherapy among term breastfed newborn infants with physiologic jaundice by whether they were fed supplemental water. Another study of breastfed term infants whose weight was appropriate for gestational age found that supplementation with water or dextrose water was associated with higher bilirubin concentrations on day 6 after birth. There is no evidence of the benefit of routinely providing water or dextrose water supplementation and there are possible harms, including interference with breastfeeding, hyponatremia, and water intoxication, and there are no clear risks, harms, or costs associated with not routinely supplementing infants with water or dextrose water who are not receiving phototherapy.

Definition of SGA and Intrauterine Growth Retardation

SGA describes neonates born with a birth weight and/or length below the normal range for gestational age. Although the terms intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) and SGA are often used as synonyms, they are not interchangeable. IUGR refers to inappropriate gain in estimated fetal weight and abdominal circumference during a certain period of gestation based on 2 ultrasound measurements, irrespective of the size at birth. Most but not all infants with IUGR may be born SGA, depending on timing and severity of the intrauterine insult. Conversely, many SGA infants will have not experienced IUGR. IUGR tends to cause a relatively large head and length relative to birth weight.

The definition of SGA requires knowledge of gestational age, precise anthropometric measurements at birth, and appropriate reference data for birth weight and birth length. Country- or ethnic-specific normative data are important for identifying those at risk. The most commonly used reference data on birth size are derived from charts developed by Usher and McLean or Niklasson, which have been used in large studies on SGA. Alternatively, the Intergrowth-21 birth weight and length standards can be used to identify SGA. We recommend the use of national growth charts, when available, or the careful selection of the most appropriate for the region and ethnic-specific population. Neonates can be subclassified into SGA for weight, SGA for length, or SGA for both weight and length. Neonates born SGA with a small head circumference should be identified, as this may point to specific etiologies. These subclassifications may help in understanding the mechanisms and implications of being born SGA.

In the previous consensus statement published in 2007, SGA was uniformly defined as a birth weight and/or length below −2.0 standard deviation scores (SDS) for gestational age. Although this definition is arbitrary, knowing that the long-term consequences of being born SGA are likely graded rather than binary, we recommend keeping the same definition of SGA as being born with birth weight and/or length below −2 SDS for gestational age according to national reference standards, since this definition identifies children at high risk of short adult stature.

Recommendation: 1.000000000000000e+00 For accurate classification of SGA, we recommend the use of national growth charts, when available, or the careful selection of the most appropriate ones for the region- and ethnic-specific population. (A +++)

Ongoing monitoring and support — late preterm and early term infants: Evaluate breastfeeding, preferably within 24 hours of birth, by a lactation consultant or other healthcare professional, and assess and document breastfeeding at least twice daily by two different healthcare professionals, preferably by using a standardized tool (e.g. LATCH Score, IBFAT, Mother/Baby Assessment Tool). Monitor vital signs every 6–8 hours, weight change, stool and urine output, and milk transfer. Late preterm and early term infants should be followed closely with a low threshold for checking bilirubin levels. Avoid excessive weight loss or dehydration, as losses greater than 3% of birth weight by 24 hours of age or greater than 7% by day 3 are excessive and may require further monitoring and adjustment of medical and breastfeeding support. Consider pre- and post-feeding test weights daily or after some (but not all) breastfeeds, and weigh on an electronic scale with accuracy at minimum ± 5 g.

### Most striking, perhaps, is the outcome of the extremely low birth weight neonate. foreword [^111SDTvL]. Journal of Perinatology (2013). Low credibility.

Because recognition of the problems of the late preterm infant has been a relatively recent development in Neonatology, few evidence-based approaches to the management of these patients have been published for the various care providers who interact with them. With the production of Multidisciplinary Guidelines for the Care of Late Preterm Infants, the National Perinatal Association, in collaboration with many expert individuals and organizations, has performed a long overdue service for caregivers that will prove invaluable to physicians, midwives, nurses, ancillary members of the health-care team, and, most importantly, the parents of late preterm infants. The methodical approach to the evaluation and management of these neonates, thoroughly supported by up-to-date references, will serve as an ideal road map to improve the outcomes for these infants. I would urge all neonatal providers to carefully read this manual and adopt these carefully considered and clearly outlined strategic approaches to the care of the late preterm infant.

### Guidelines for parenteral nutrition in preterm infants: the American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition [^114WYnA8]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2023). High credibility.

Parenteral nutrition initiation timing — preterm infants: We recommend prompt initiation of PN after birth as soon as appropriate vascular access is obtained. Quality of evidence: Very low. Strength of recommendation: Strong. Trials included in this analysis delayed PN initiation by 1–3 days after birth and evaluated short-term growth outcomes, including days to regain birth weight (BW), and one single study with 40 infants in each group reported a significantly smaller postnatal weight loss as a percentage of BW with earlier initiation of AA and ILE.

### Long-term adverse outcomes of low birth weight, increased somatic growth rates, and alterations of body composition in the premature infant: review of the evidence [^115mBVZz]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2007). Low credibility.

In appropriate-for-gestational-age preterm infants, data are reviewed to support that both high and low nutrient intakes, as well as fast or slow rates of growth in the neonatal intensive care unit, have long-term adverse (or even positive) effects on body weight and the metabolic syndrome later in life. Though more studies are needed, it is concluded that it is likely that any such effects will be relatively small compared with other risk factors such as parental weight and various lifestyle factors. At the present time, there is little evidence that negates the goal of maximizing nutritional support for the very low birth weight infant in the neonatal period.

Infant postoperative monitoring for ambulatory surgery — Institutional guidelines generally require full term infants less than 4 weeks or preterm infants < 50 post-menstrual weeks to be monitored for at least 12 hours postoperatively. Healthy full term infants > 4 weeks and less than 6 months of age should be monitored at least 2–4 hours after surgery and should be scheduled early in the day.

Term and late preterm neonatal resuscitation — initial oxygen concentration is framed as a clinical question with Last Full Review: ILCOR 2019, asking whether use of a lower initial oxygen concentration for respiratory support of term or late preterm (35 week's gestation or more) newborn infants, compared with a higher initial oxygen concentration, changes short-term mortality and other clinical outcomes.

Against this, it should be acknowledged that rapid early weight gain in preterm infants is associated with improved developmental outcome in infancy. Thus, there may be a complex trade-off to be made between avoiding adverse metabolic outcomes, through slower weight gain, and optimising mental development, by increasing gain. However, it should be noted that to date no other experimental study evaluating 'aggressive' nutritional regimens designed to achieve more rapid growth in preterm infants has led to improved neurodevelopmental outcome. Whether the relationship between more rapid weight gain and improved neurodevelopment is causal thus remains unanswered. It is also plausible that non-nutritional factors may play a part in the adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes associated with growth impairment.

Recommended nutritional intakes for preterm babies have traditionally been calculated from the nutrient accretion rate of the so-called reference fetus, to which is added nutrition necessary to redress the cumulative shortfall acquired by preterm infants during the early postnatal period. This poses a conundrum: should clinicians target nutritional support for preterm infants to achieve the weight of term-born infants by term (higher velocity) in keeping with the pattern depicted on current growth charts, or should the target be convergence with term-born trajectories at a later stage (lower velocity)? Despite slow weight gain, the overwhelming majority of preterm infants today rapidly catch up in relation to head circumference, and in height as well as weight over a longer period, regardless of the nature of early nutritional support. The UK-WHO growth standard indicates that by 1 year of age, term-born, breast-fed infants are 500 g lighter than the weight depicted in the UK 1990 growth reference. A key question for neonatal care is therefore whether preterm infants would also be better served by a slower postnatal weight velocity, and separately whether the emphasis of clinical management should be on optimising early nutritional support, bearing in mind that that weight change is a poor reflection of nutritional support in the immediate postnatal period, given the normal physiological loss of extracellular fluid that occurs at this time. It is certainly the case that many clinicians are reluctant to start parenteral nutrition and minimal enteral feeds on day one. A more prompt delivery of parenteral and enteral nutrition would undoubtedly help minimise postnatal catabolism and loss of body solids regardless of the difficulties of monitoring.

### Randomized outcome trial of nutrient-enriched formula and neurodevelopment outcome in preterm infants [^111Xc1CJ]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Our findings are consistent with other studies that investigated the effect of protein and energy supplementation after discharge on preterm infants' neurodevelopment. However, it must be underlined that in all but one (ref.) of these studies, the actual energy and protein intake of the enrolled infants was not reported. Therefore, it is not possible to make a comparison with the actual protein and energy intake of infants enrolled in the present study.

Young et al. recently conducted a meta-analysis, including two randomized controlled trials. They concluded that the benefits of using energy and protein supplementation after discharge in preterm infants are not supported by the available evidence.

In one trial, randomized 113 preterm infants with a birth weight < 1.75 g and < 34 weeks of gestation, were fed either a preterm infant formula (2.2 g protein/100 mL and 80 kcal/100 ml) or a term formula (1.4 g protein/100 mL and 66 kcal/100 ml) from discharge until 6 months of corrected age. Alternatively, they were fed the preterm formula from discharge to full-term and the full-term formula from full-term to 6 months of corrected age. The authors reported no significant difference in mental or psychomotor development at 18 months of age. In another trial, 196 preterm infants weighing < 3.000 g at time of discharge were randomly assigned to receive either a nutrient-enriched post discharge formula (1.85 g protein/100 mL and 72 kcal/100 ml) or a standard full-term formula (1.45 g protein/100 mL and 68 kcal/100 ml) until 9 months' post term. Developmental scores at 9 or 18 months, assessed using the Bayley Scales of Infant Development II, were similar between the groups. However, infants fed the nutrient-enriched formula had a 2.8 point advantage in the Psychomotor Development Index.

### Neonatal outcomes and delivery of care for infants born late preterm or moderately preterm: a prospective population-based study [^112VZe2U]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Late (34 +0–36 +6 weeks) and moderately (32 +0–33 +6 weeks) preterm (LMPT) births comprise 6–7% of UK births and 75% of all preterm births. Compared with term-born infants, increased proportions of LMPT infants will require neonatal unit(NNU) admission for specialist careand develop long-term health and neurodevelopmental problems. Most previous research in this group has been retrospective and/or single centre. A paucity of prospective, population-based research has prevented full evaluation of the impact of LMPT births on delivery of care, resource use or clinical challenges. The extent to which management of these infants reflects local policy or practice as opposed to individual clinical need has not been quantified. In the UK, infants expected to require no medical input are cared for with their mothers by midwives on a normal postnatal ward and are only reviewed by a medical practitioner if there is cause for concern. Within a prospective study, we, therefore, sought to describe neonatal outcomes and delivery of medical care until discharge, both within and outside NNUs, for uncomplicated singleton births and to explore variation in clinical practice with respect to management of these infants.
