## Question

protocol for management of elevated renin level

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a protocol to manage an elevated renin level, with a clear reasoning flow with self-verification along the way. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about verifying that the renin measurement is accurate and collected under standardized conditions. Then, I should assess the clinical context to determine whether the elevation is expected, physiologic, or pathologic. Next, I will review medications that raise or suppress renin and could mislead interpretation. After that, I will direct management toward the underlying etiology rather than the renin number itself. Finally, I will outline monitoring and reassessment, emphasizing what outcomes to track and what not to do with a high renin value [^115bXNhZ] [^115GAyMZ].

> Let me first confirm the measurement reliability because preanalytical and assay factors can artifactually alter renin; I need to check posture (ambulatory ≥ 2 hours, then seated 5–15 minutes), tourniquet technique with release for at least 5 seconds before venipuncture, avoidance of fist clenching, timely plasma separation, and a liberal sodium and replete potassium state for ARR-related testing, and I should verify whether the lab used direct renin concentration (DRC) or plasma renin activity (PRA) and apply the corresponding reference intervals, keeping in mind oral contraceptives can falsely elevate DRC and that cryoactivation and storage conditions can distort results, so if conditions were suboptimal or the result is discordant, I should repeat under standardized conditions [^115guxTh] [^112WYv6D] [^1143zvR8] [^111hrmSu] [^111zompz].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions and treat "high renin"; renin is a marker of physiology and pathophysiology, not a disease, so I need to ensure I am interpreting renin within the clinical picture and not using it as a standalone therapeutic target, since its role in guiding therapy is limited in individuals and better suited to indicating mechanism than directing drug choice in isolation [^113N1Cxq] [^111Wsui5].

> Let me consider expected or therapeutic causes first; RAAS blockade with ACE inhibitors, ARBs, or MRAs appropriately disinhibits renin, and in CKD with albuminuria, diabetes, and HFrEF this is desired and guideline-directed, so I should not stop or down-titrate solely because renin is elevated, but I should confirm euvolemia, monitor potassium and creatinine 7–14 days after changes, and titrate to maximally tolerated doses per KDIGO, ADA, and HF guidelines, recognizing that on-therapy renin rise reflects mechanism rather than harm per se [^115YuZ9N] [^112GvUmE] [^116hynxJ] [^117HpBwC] [^113rGEo6] [^111knoNE] [^111cLeL3] [^111yY9D9] [^113KdWnS] [^117XnBu6] [^111r5wu5].

> Wait, I should verify physiologic triggers too; sodium restriction and hypovolemia predictably raise renin, so if there is volume depletion from over-diuresis or stringent sodium restriction, I should reassess volume status and dietary sodium and, if safe, liberalize sodium or reduce diuretic intensity rather than "treating renin", since the elevation is an appropriate response to reduced effective circulating volume [^117UytHJ] [^115GAyMZ] [^115bXNhZ].

> Next, I will examine pathologic causes that require evaluation; renovascular hypertension from renal artery stenosis raises renin via renal hypoperfusion, so in the right phenotype I should pursue imaging to confirm hemodynamically significant stenosis, manage atherosclerotic risk, use ACEi/ARB cautiously in unilateral disease, and avoid these agents in bilateral RAS or solitary kidney with critical stenosis while considering revascularization when criteria are met [^115GAyMZ].

> Let me think about renin-secreting tumors; reninoma is rare but classically presents with severe hypertension, headaches, hypokalemia, and markedly high renin in younger patients, particularly women, so I should pursue cross-sectional renal imaging for localization and plan for curative surgical resection when feasible, using RAAS blockers as bridge therapy if needed and recognizing pregnancy contraindications to ACEi/ARB [^112B4Bdn] [^115eVkLK] [^116E1sad].

> I should also confirm cardiac contributors; in heart failure, reduced renal perfusion activates renin, so management should optimize guideline-directed medical therapy, including RAAS inhibition and, when indicated, ARNi to improve outcomes, rather than targeting renin directly, because the renin elevation is mechanistic rather than a discrete treatment target [^115GAyMZ] [^117XnBu6].

> But wait, what if aldosterone is low; in primary adrenal insufficiency, loss of mineralocorticoid effect removes negative feedback and elevates renin, so I should replace mineralocorticoid with fludrocortisone and use renin as a monitoring biomarker for adequacy of replacement rather than a pathology to suppress [^115TXjkC].

> Let me not overlook prognostic contexts; in shock, critical illness, or perioperative states, elevated renin correlates with mortality and adverse renal outcomes, but management focuses on underlying hemodynamics and perfusion support, with renin serving as a risk marker and, in select settings, a potential guide to vasopressor choice, rather than a therapeutic target itself [^115EFtZW].

> I should double-check medications that confound interpretation; ACEi, ARBs, diuretics, and dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers tend to raise renin and can yield false-negative ARR screens, whereas beta-blockers, central alpha-2 agonists, and NSAIDs suppress renin and can produce false-positive ARR results, so when the clinical question is PA screening or renin interpretation, I should, if safe, withdraw or substitute interfering agents per guideline timelines before retesting to avoid misleading results [^115guxTh] [^112WYv6D] [^1143zvR8] [^114smf9G].

> Hold on, I should verify the PA angle explicitly; in the workup of primary aldosteronism, elevated renin generally argues against renin-independent aldosterone excess, so if renin is high, PA is unlikely and I should redirect the diagnostic pathway accordingly, whereas suppressed renin with inappropriately high aldosterone supports PA, prompting ARR-based screening under standardized conditions with repeat testing or confirmatory tests as indicated and with attention to assay-specific cutoffs when transitioning between PRA and DRC [^112WYv6D] [^111KrBWa] [^112DDjUQ] [^111hrmSu] [^1114bPr4].

> I need to ensure my management is directed at the cause, not the renin value; for CKD, diabetes, or heart failure, I should continue RAAS blockers despite high renin, for hypovolemia address volume and sodium, for renovascular disease evaluate and treat the lesion, for reninoma resect, and for adrenal insufficiency replace mineralocorticoid, and importantly there is no evidence-based protocol to "titrate therapy down" because renin is high, whereas renin-guided up-titration of MRAs applies to low-renin states and probable PA, not to elevated renin scenarios [^115YuZ9N] [^112GvUmE] [^115TXjkC] [^112B4Bdn] [^115JVAvN] [^113zFjLE] [^114BJP1M].

> Let me reconsider monitoring and thresholds; after addressing modifiable contributors, I should repeat renin if the elevation is unexplained, but I should primarily follow clinical endpoints like blood pressure, potassium, renal function, and symptoms, not the absolute renin value, and after initiating or adjusting RAAS inhibitors I should recheck labs within 1–2 weeks and accept small to moderate creatinine rises if euvolemic and clinically appropriate, though I should double-check thresholds since most guidance accepts up to a 30% rise and some statements can be phrased ambiguously, so contextual clinical judgment is key [^111r5wu5] [^115YuZ9N] [^116nxhEz].

> In summary, I need to ensure the renin result is valid, determine whether the elevation is expected on therapy or physiologic, rule in or out key pathologies such as renovascular hypertension, reninoma, heart failure, or adrenal insufficiency, correct for medication interferences when ARR-based questions arise, and then treat the underlying condition rather than "normalizing renin", using renin as a mechanistic and occasionally prognostic biomarker within the broader clinical context [^115GAyMZ] [^115bXNhZ] [^115EFtZW].

---

Elevated renin requires a structured approach: **confirm true elevation** by repeating renin/aldosterone with corrected potassium, liberal sodium [^115guxTh], and after stopping interfering drugs (diuretics, ACEi/ARB, beta-blockers) for 2–4 weeks if safe [^112WYv6D]. Next, **identify the cause** [^115GAyMZ] with history, exam, labs, and imaging to distinguish renovascular disease, reninoma [^112B4Bdn], secondary hyperaldosteronism [^116E1sad], or medication effects. Management is cause-specific: revascularize renovascular disease, resect reninoma [^115eVkLK], correct volume/sodium issues, and adjust medications; use RAAS blockers for hypertension/CKD/heart failure [^115VhSvD] [^117XnBu6] with close monitoring of potassium and renal function [^111r5wu5]. Monitor renin, aldosterone, potassium, and renal function regularly, and refer to endocrinology or nephrology for complex or refractory cases.

---

## Step 1: confirm true elevation of renin

### Repeat testing under standardized conditions

- **Timing**: Morning, after ≥ 2 hours ambulatory [^115guxTh], seated 5–15 minutes before draw [^112WYv6D].
- **Diet**: Liberal sodium intake; avoid restriction [^115guxTh] [^117UytHJ].
- **Potassium**: Correct hypokalemia before testing [^112WYv6D] [^115guxTh].
- **Medications**: Stop aldosterone antagonists, potassium-sparing/wasting diuretics ≥ 4 weeks; ACEi/ARB [^1155wk7z], beta-blockers, centrally acting alpha-2 agonists ≥ 2 weeks if safe [^112WYv6D] [^115guxTh] [^114smf9G].
- **Sample handling**: Collect at room temperature [^111zompz]; process promptly to avoid cryoactivation [^113FiJ18].

---

## Step 2: identify underlying causes

### Clinical evaluation

Clinical evaluation should include a focused **history** covering hypertension, hypokalemia, volume status, medication use, and family history, and a targeted **exam** assessing blood pressure and other signs of secondary hypertension, including volume status [^115GAyMZ].

---

### Laboratory evaluation

- **Aldosterone**: Measure to assess secondary hyperaldosteronism [^115bXNhZ].
- **Electrolytes**: Sodium, potassium, creatinine, eGFR [^115TXjkC].
- **ARR**: Calculate to differentiate primary vs secondary aldosteronism [^112DDjUQ].

---

### Imaging studies

- **Renal arteries**: Duplex ultrasound, CT angiography, or MR angiography for stenosis.
- **Reninoma**: Renal MRI or CT for juxtaglomerular cell tumor [^112B4Bdn].
- **Adrenals**: CT/MRI if secondary hyperaldosteronism suspected.

---

## Step 3: management based on underlying cause

### Renovascular hypertension (renal artery stenosis)

In renovascular hypertension (renal artery stenosis), **revascularization** with angioplasty ± stenting is appropriate for significant stenosis, while **medical therapy** with ACEi/ARB [^111r5wu5] requires close monitoring of renal function and potassium [^115VhSvD].

---

### Reninoma (juxtaglomerular cell tumor)

For reninoma (juxtaglomerular cell tumor), **surgery** with partial nephrectomy or tumor excision is curative [^115eVkLK]; **medical therapy** with ACEi/ARB or beta-blockers is used if surgery is delayed or contraindicated [^112B4Bdn].

---

### Secondary hyperaldosteronism (e.g. heart failure, cirrhosis, nephrotic syndrome)

In secondary hyperaldosteronism (e.g. heart failure, cirrhosis, nephrotic syndrome), address the **underlying cause** by optimizing management of heart failure, cirrhosis, or nephrotic syndrome, and use **RAAS blockade** with ACEi/ARB or MRAs with careful monitoring [^116E1sad] [^115VhSvD] [^111r5wu5].

---

### Medication-induced elevated renin

For medication-induced elevated renin, make **adjustments** by modifying or discontinuing offending agents when feasible, and choose **alternatives** with less impact on renin when possible [^115GAyMZ].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Monitoring and follow-up should include **reassessment of renin and aldosterone** after interventions and regular monitoring of potassium and creatinine [^111r5wu5] [^115QXn5h]. Track **blood pressure**, adjust therapy to targets, and repeat imaging as needed to confirm resolution.

---

## Referral to specialists

Referral to specialists should be guided by the underlying pathology. Appropriate referrals include **endocrinology** for suspected reninoma, secondary hyperaldosteronism, or complex endocrine disorders; **nephrology** for renovascular hypertension, CKD, or complex renal disease; and **cardiology** for heart failure or complex cardiovascular disease [^115guxTh].

---

## Patient education and lifestyle modifications

Patient education and lifestyle modifications should emphasize **moderating sodium intake** to avoid excessive renin stimulation [^117UytHJ] and ensuring strict adherence to medications and follow-up. Counseling should promote weight loss, regular exercise, smoking cessation, and alcohol moderation [^115guxTh].

---

## Special considerations

Special considerations include pregnancy, in which **ACEi/ARB should be avoided** [^115eVkLK] and beta-blockers or methyldopa considered. Pediatric patients require age- and growth-appropriate evaluation and management. In critical illness, renin may serve as a prognostic marker, while management focuses on the underlying condition [^115EFtZW].

---

## Step 8: documentation and communication

Maintain clear **records** of findings, interventions, and follow-up, and emphasize **teamwork** by communicating with the care team and specialists.

---

Elevated renin management requires confirming true elevation, identifying the cause, and applying targeted therapy with ongoing monitoring; **cause-specific treatment** and specialist input are essential for optimal outcomes.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for primary aldosteronism — more specifically with respect to the plasma aldosterone-to-renin ratio (technical considerations) — the ES 2025 guidelines recommend repeating the test on a different day if the patient's initial screen is negative and factors such as hypokalemia or medications could have led to a false-negative result. Correct hypokalemia where present and withdraw interfering medications if safe and feasible. Withdraw mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, epithelial sodium channel inhibitors (such as amiloride and triamterene), and other diuretics for 4 weeks, and ACE inhibitors and ARBs for 2 weeks, as these medications raise renin or lower aldosterone.

Measure plasma potassium in blood collected slowly with a syringe and needle, preferably not using a vacuum-sealed blood collection tube, for accurate potassium determination. Avoid fist clenching during collection, wait at least 5 seconds after tourniquet release to insert the needle, and ensure separation of plasma from cells within 30 minutes of collection.

### Approach to the patient: Reninoma [^112B4Bdn]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Low credibility.

Fewer than 200 cases of renin-producing tumors (reninomas or juxtaglomerular cell tumors, JGCTs) have been described since their discovery in 1967 by Robertson. The true prevalence is not known, as their presence may be masked by RAAS inhibitors or misdiagnosed as renovascular hypertension (RVH). Reninomas have a tendency to occur in young women, with a female-to-male ratio of 2:1 and a mean age of 27 years. They classically present with a triad of headache, hypertension, and hypokalemia.

An unusual degree of resolution is seen with RAAS system blockade through either ACE inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockade. Hypertension is typically severe, with a median reported blood pressure of 201/130 mm Hg, and hypokalemia is present in more than 80% of cases.

Appropriate monitoring of patients at the initiation and shortly after the commencement of therapy with RAASi is critical. Careful monitoring and cautious dose adjustment are absolutely essential to successfully maintain high-risk patients on maximal RAASi therapy.

Before starting or changing the RAASi dose, it is necessary to comprehensively review prescribed medications (e.g. trimethoprim or β-blockers, both shown to increase serum potassium) and over-the-counter medications (such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents), in addition to assessing intravascular volume status. An accurate assessment of the patient's ideal weight is helpful in this regard. Patients significantly lower than their target body weight may already be sodium avid and not provide the distal sodium delivery needed to support potassium excretion. Patients significantly greater than their target body weight may have cardiac decompensation, which can reduce renal blood flow, activate the RAAS, and reduce distal sodium delivery. It is important to avoid starting or increasing the RAASi dose until patients are optimized with regard to intravascular volume, stable kidney function, and when other medications that increase serum potassium have been stopped or reduced as much as possible. Clearly, starting RAASi in the setting of hyperkalemia is not advisable. Repeat laboratory testing 10 to 14 days after delaying or after starting or changing the RAASi dose is important. Close monitoring is essential once a stable RAASi dose is achieved.

Among other possible causes, increased serum renin can be caused by:

- **Endocrine and adrenal disorders**: Congenital adrenal hyperplasia, primary adrenal insufficiency, Addison's disease
- **Cardiovascular issues**: Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, renovascular hypertension, malignant hypertension
- **Liver and renal conditions**: Liver cirrhosis, nephrotic syndrome, minimal change disease, renal artery stenosis
- **Other medical conditions**: Major bleeding, dehydration, low sodium intake, juxtaglomerular cell tumor, critical illness

Additionally, increased serum renin can result from medications such as:

- **Beta-blockers and alpha-blockers**: Propranolol ER, atenolol, propranolol, prazosin
- **Centrally acting and other antihypertensives**: Methyldopa, clonidine
- **Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and related**: Indomethacin, indomethacin ER
- **Other medications**: Fludrocortisone, ketoconazole

Regarding diagnostic investigations for primary aldosteronism, specifically concerning the plasma aldosterone-to-renin ratio, the initial testing according to the HC 2020 guidelines involves obtaining plasma aldosterone and plasma renin activity or renin mass/concentration as follows:

- **Preparation**: Ensure the patient is ambulatory (sitting, standing, or walking) for at least 2 hours in the morning. The patient should be seated for 5–15 minutes before the blood draw. Correct hypokalemia and provide liberalized sodium intake.

- **Medication impact**: Withdraw agents that markedly affect results (aldosterone antagonists, potassium-sparing and -wasting diuretics) at least 4–6 weeks before testing.

- **Repeat testing**: If results are not diagnostic and hypertension can be controlled with medications less likely to interfere with testing (slow-release verapamil, diltiazem, hydralazine, prazosin, doxazosin, and terazosin), and after withdrawing medications likely to interfere with test accuracy (β-blockers, centrally acting α-2 agonists, ARBs, ACE inhibitors, directly acting renin inhibitors, and dihydropyridine CCBs), repeat testing 2 weeks after withdrawal.

- **False positives awareness**: Recognize the possibility of false positive results with direct renin mass/concentration in females using oral contraceptives. Discontinue oral contraceptives for 1 month before testing if possible, or alternatively, measure plasma renin activity instead.

### Approach to the patient: Reninoma [^115eVkLK]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Low credibility.

A reninoma is a functional tumor of afferent arteriolar juxtaglomerular cells that secretes the enzyme renin, leading to hyperactivation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Reninoma is a potentially curable cause of pathological secondary hyperaldosteronism that results in often severe hypertension and hypokalemia. The lack of suppression of plasma renin contrasts sharply with the much more common primary aldosteronism, but diagnosis is often prompted by screening for that condition.

The major differential diagnosis of reninoma is renovascular hypertension. Fewer than 200 cases of reninoma have been described. Reninomas have been reported across a broad demographic but have a 2:1 predilection for women, often of childbearing age. Aldosterone receptor blockade, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, or angiotensin receptor blockers offer effective medical management but are contraindicated in pregnancy, so surgical curative resection is ideal.

The optimal imaging and biochemical workup of reninoma and management approach, ideally tumor excision with subtotal renal resection, are described.

### Therapeutic perspectives in hypertension: novel means for renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system modulation and emerging device-based approaches [^114A4zqV]. European Heart Journal (2011). Low credibility.

The interplay of recently discovered components of the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system is crucial in understanding hypertension treatment. The protease renin cleaves angiotensinogen to angiotensin I, which is then hydrolyzed by the circulating and local angiotensin-converting enzyme to form the active angiotensin II. Angiotensin II may alternatively be formed by chymase, carboxypeptidase, cathepsin G, or tonin.

Angiotensin I might also be converted directly by neutral endopeptidase or indirectly by angiotensin-converting enzyme and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, with angiotensin 1–9 as an intermediate product, to angiotensin 1–7. Angiotensin 1–7 is further degraded by angiotensin-converting enzyme to angiotensin 1–5, while angiotensin II is degraded to angiotensin III and IV by aminopeptidase A and M.

- **Receptors of the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system**: These include the (pro)renin receptor, which enhances renin activity, activates prorenin, and elicits angiotensin-independent effects. The deleterious effects of renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system activation are attributed to the stimulation of angiotensin type 1 receptors by angiotensin II and III. The angiotensin type 4 receptor, also known as insulin-regulated aminopeptidase, is modestly researched and stimulated by angiotensin IV, exerting negative effects.

- **Beneficial effects**: The stimulation of the angiotensin type 2 receptor, which binds angiotensin II, angiotensin 1–9, and angiotensin III, and the Mas receptor, which binds angiotensin 1–7, appears to elicit beneficial effects.

Abbreviations: AT 1 R, angiotensin type 1 receptor; AT 2 R, angiotensin type 2 receptor; AT 4 R, angiotensin type 4 receptor.

### KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease [^115YuZ9N]. Kidney International (2024). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of chronic kidney disease, particularly concerning RAAS inhibitors such as ACEis and ARBs, the KDIGO 2024 guidelines recommend initiating renin-angiotensin-system inhibitors (ACEi or ARB) in patients with CKD and moderately-to-severely increased albuminuria (G1-G4, A2-A3) with diabetes.

### Using renin activity to guide mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist therapy in patients with low renin and hypertension [^113zFjLE]. American Journal of Hypertension (2023). Low credibility.

In this retrospective observational study, we found that mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA) therapy targeting unsuppressed renin levels in patients with low renin hypertension (LRH) or probable primary aldosteronism (PA) was associated with substantial decreases in blood pressure and proteinuria, with minimal adverse events that could be easily managed. Importantly, the effectiveness of this treatment approach was similar regardless of whether patients had a likely LRH phenotype (aldosterone 10 ng/dl), implying that empiric MRA therapy in patients with LRH could be an effective and pragmatic approach to achieving blood pressure control and potentially preventing complications in this underdiagnosed and undertreated condition.

The treatment strategy of targeting unsuppressed renin was highly effective in lowering blood pressure, with a mean decrease in systolic blood pressure (SBP) exceeding 20 mm Hg, despite the majority of patients discontinuing at least one baseline anti-hypertensive medication. This magnitude of blood pressure reduction compares favorably with what has been seen in most studies of other anti-hypertensive medications where baseline blood pressure was at a similar level. Unlike some previously reported investigations, blood pressure reductions were similar between spironolactone and eplerenone, while eplerenone doses were approximately twice as high as spironolactone, consistent with their relative mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist potency.

### Standards of care in diabetes — 2025 [^115QXn5h]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of diabetes mellitus type 1, particularly in managing diabetic nephropathy, the ADA 2025 guidelines recommend using renin-angiotensin system inhibitors. It is advised to monitor for increased serum creatinine and serum potassium levels when ACE inhibitors (ACEis), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), or mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists are used. Monitoring for hypokalemia is necessary when diuretics are utilized, both at routine visits and 7–14 days after initiation or following a dose change.

### KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease [^115VhSvD]. Kidney International (2024). High credibility.

The KDIGO 2024 guidelines focus on the medical management of chronic kidney disease, specifically regarding the use of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors. The guidelines recommend administering ACE inhibitors (ACEis) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) at the highest approved dose tolerated to achieve the desired therapeutic benefits.

### Diagnosis and treatment of primary adrenal insufficiency: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^115TXjkC]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for primary adrenal insufficiency, specifically in relation to plasma renin and aldosterone, the ES 2016 guidelines recommend obtaining simultaneous measurements of plasma renin and aldosterone in patients with adrenal insufficiency to assess for the presence of mineralocorticoid deficiency.

### Aldosterone-targeted therapies: Early implementation in resistant hypertension and chronic kidney disease [^116tHnR5]. European Heart Journal (2025). Low credibility.

Several cardiorenal diseases, such as heart failure (HF), coronary artery disease, and chronic kidney disease (CKD), enhance aldosterone through renin-dependent aldosteronism. These diseases were classically managed with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ACEi/ARB), which suppress aldosterone over the short term. However, aldosterone often rebounds over the long term (more than six months), a phenomenon known as aldosterone breakthrough.

Additionally, the hyper-aldosterone state in cardiorenal diseases is not only related to excess aldosterone levels. It is mainly driven by an increased aldosterone ligand-dependent activation of mineralocorticoid receptors (MRs). The MRs are activated and overexpressed, independent from aldosterone levels in cardiorenal diseases. Moreover, cortisol is the other natural MR ligand, which may also activate the MRs in pathological states.

Therefore, even for individuals with renin-dependent aldosteronism, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA) therapy is essential for mitigating the insufficient and short-lived control of aldosterone excess by ACEi/ARBs. This therapy blocks the over-activated receptor, shielding it from both aldosterone and cortisol effects, and improves prognosis as proven by pivotal clinical trials.

### Standards of care in diabetes — 2025 [^111knoNE]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for diabetes mellitus type 2, and more specifically, the management of diabetic nephropathy, the ADA 2025 guidelines recommend initiating either an ACE inhibitor (ACEi) or an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) in nonpregnant patients with diabetes and hypertension who have moderately increased albuminuria (urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio 30–299 mg/g creatinine) and/or an eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m². This treatment should be titrated to the maximally tolerated dose to prevent the progression of kidney disease and reduce cardiovascular events.

### Case detection in primary aldosteronism: High-diagnostic value of the aldosterone-to-renin ratio when performed under standardized conditions [^112DDjUQ]. Journal of Hypertension (2018). Low credibility.

The aldosterone-to-renin ratio is widely used and is the recommended screening modality for primary aldosteronism by the Endocrine Society Guideline. However, studies on its diagnostic accuracy have been inconsistent, which is mainly because of methodological limitations. We set out to evaluate this diagnostic value by using a highly standardized study protocol, which is in line with the Endocrine Society Guideline recommendations regarding indications for screening, testing conditions, and reference standards in daily clinical practice.

In this prospective study, 233 consecutive patients referred to the University Medical Center Utrecht with difficult-to-control hypertension were enrolled. In addition to aldosterone-to-renin ratio measurements, all patients underwent a saline infusion test as a reference standard. A plasma aldosterone concentration greater than 280 pmol/l after saline infusion was considered diagnostic for aldosteronism and the plasma renin activity was assessed to exclude patients with secondary aldosteronism from the final primary aldosteronism diagnosis.

Correlation of the aldosterone-to-renin ratio (cut-off > 5) with primary aldosteronism diagnosis showed 16 true positive, 29 false positive, 188 true negative, and 0 false negative aldosterone-to-renin ratios, resulting in a sensitivity of 100% (CI 75.9–100), specificity of 86.7% (CI 81.2–90.7), positive predictive value of 35.6% (CI 22.3–51.3), and negative predictive value of 100% (CI 97.5–100.0). The corresponding area under the curve was 0.933 (CI 0.900–0.966).

### Treating primary aldosteronism-induced hypertension: Novel approaches and future outlooks [^112hXEWu]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). Low credibility.

Screening for primary aldosteronism (PA) relies on the simultaneous measurement of plasma aldosterone concentration and plasma (direct) renin concentration or plasma renin activity, allowing for the calculation of the aldosterone-renin ratio (ARR). In nearly all cases, except for a few (e.g. young age with marked aldosteronism, hypertension, and hypokalemia with complete renin suppression), a positive ARR screen is followed by confirmatory dynamic testing, including:

1. Saline infusion test (SIT)
2. Oral salt suppression test
3. Captopril challenge test
4. Fludrocortisone suppression test

Although this approach is generally advocated by specialists in the field, there is considerable heterogeneity concerning the diagnostic thresholds employed for each of these tests. Additionally, in recent years, an "expanding spectrum of primary aldosteronism" has been acknowledged, suggesting that PA may not be readily diagnosed or distinguished based solely on rigid diagnostic cutoffs. For instance, Vaidya et al. describe a spectrum of disease ranging from clinically overt PA (patients with severe and/or resistant hypertension) that is detectable using thresholds for biochemical confirmation, to unrecognized yet biochemically overt PA (in patients with normotension or mild/moderate hypertension). These findings suggest the existence of "subclinical" or "nonclassical" categories of PA (normotensive patients with autonomous aldosterone secretion) who are likely to go unnoticed because they do not meet screening indications for PA.

### Renin as a prognostic marker in intensive care and perioperative settings: A scoping review [^115EFtZW]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2024). High credibility.

Serum renin increases in response to sympathetic nerve activation and hypotension. Recent studies have reported the association of serum renin levels with adverse clinical outcomes in acute care settings. This scoping review aimed to systematically review the available literature on renin as a prognostic marker in intensive care and perioperative patients. We searched for studies published since inception until March 31, 2023, which assessed the association between serum renin levels and clinical outcomes or the effect of synthetic angiotensin II administration on serum renin levels in critically ill and perioperative patients in PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library.

The primary outcome was mortality at the longest follow-up; the secondary outcomes were adverse renal outcomes (i.e. acute kidney injury, the need for renal replacement therapy, and major adverse kidney events), hemodynamic instability, outcomes to angiotensin II administration, and prognostic performance for mortality when compared with lactate. Among the 2081 studies identified, we included 16 studies with 1573 patients (7 studies on shock, 5 on nonspecific critical illness, 2 on cardiac surgery, 1 on noncardiac surgery, and 1 on coronavirus disease 2019). A significant association between serum renin levels and poor outcomes was identified in 14 studies, with 10 studies demonstrating an association with mortality. One post hoc analysis found that angiotensin II administration reduced mortality in patients with markedly elevated renin values. Two studies showed that renin was superior to lactate as a prognostic marker.

### Influence of sodium intake and change in sodium intake on plasma-renin in man [^117UytHJ]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Low credibility.

- **Data analysis**: Two authors (NG and GJ or NG and THG) independently recorded data from each trial. Discrepancies were resolved by agreement. The following data were recorded: the sample size (N); the mean age of participants; the mean weight of participants; the duration of the intervention; level of renin in plasma and standard deviations during low-sodium and usual/high-sodium diets. Other renin units than ng/mL/hour were, when possible, transformed to ng/mL/hour; the sodium reduction measured as the difference between 24-hour urinary sodium excretion during low-sodium and usual/high-sodium diets and standard deviation (SD); SBP (SD) and DBP (SD) before and after intervention.

- **Assessment of risk of bias in included studies**: This was performed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool described in Chapter 8 of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions, including selection bias, performance bias, detection bias, and attrition bias.

- **Measures of treatment effect**: PRA measurements are continuous. Consequently, the outcome measure was defined as the mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) between the changes from baseline to end of treatment during low- and high-sodium diets.

### Pharmacotherapy: Optimal blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system [^116j8i2J]. Nature Reviews Cardiology (2013). Low credibility.

Inhibition of the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS) is a successful therapy for hypertension, heart failure, and renal insufficiency. Overdosing of RAAS inhibitors is occasionally observed when several agents are used together, and this can cause adverse events such as hypotension, hyperkalaemia, and renal failure. We advocate optimal, rather than complete, RAAS blockade.

### KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease [^112GvUmE]. Kidney International (2024). High credibility.

The KDIGO 2024 guidelines recommend initiating a renin-angiotensin-system inhibitor (ACEi or ARB) in patients with CKD and moderately-to-severely increased albuminuria (G1-G4, A2-A3) with diabetes. This recommendation pertains specifically to the medical management of diabetic nephropathy, particularly in regard to RAAS inhibitors, ACEis/ARBs.

### Mitigating risk of aldosterone in diabetic kidney disease [^115khecU]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2020). Low credibility.

Until recent data from studies of sodium-glucose transporter 2 inhibitors or glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists were presented, the standard of care in diabetic kidney disease (DKD) for almost 20 years has been the blockade of the renin–angiotensin system (RAS) with ACE inhibitors (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) on top of glucose management. Although this improves renal and cardiovascular outcomes, such as the development of doubling of serum creatinine, end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), and hospitalization for heart failure, up to 50% of individuals have been reported to reach the primary endpoint after 4 years in the treated group. These data come from a study completed almost 20 years ago.

Hyperkalemia was a problem in the RENAAL study with losartan as monotherapy. Indeed, 38% of individuals had elevated potassium levels (> 5.0 mmol/l) after 6 months compared with 23% in the placebo group. Elevated potassium was associated with an increased risk of renal outcomes.

The insufficient effect on renal and cardiovascular outcomes is explained by RAS blockade being incomplete. ACE inhibitors can be bypassed by angiotensin II formation from chymases, and angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockade may be incomplete. This led to the exploration of dual blockade with a combination of ACE inhibitors and ARBs. In DKD, dual blockade was able to reduce proteinuria compared with single-agent intervention but did not provide long-term renal benefit in the VA Nephron D study, which was stopped for futility and side effects including hyperkalemia. The addition of renin inhibition was also not efficient long-term, as reported in the ALTITUDE study.

### An individualized approach to the evaluation and management of primary aldosteronism [^117UrvkC]. Endocrine Practice (2017). Low credibility.

With the increased emphasis on personalized and individualized medicine, the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists Adrenal Scientific Committee has developed a series of articles to update members on personalized medicine as it applies to adrenal diseases.

- **Methods**: We synthesized literature reviews, guidelines from professional societies, and personal experience.

- **Results**: Since Conn described primary aldosteronism (PA) over 60 years ago, debate has raged about the prevalence of PA in the hypertensive population, the wisdom of broadly screening for PA, and prudent approaches to evaluate and manage these patients. Accumulated data from multiple centers around the globe have begun to crystallize the clinical characteristics about these patients, which allows for an individualized approach before the diagnosis of PA is even established. Evidence-based criteria for screening, improved and widely available clinical assays, and validated algorithms for evaluation empower all endocrinologists to address this complex disease in an effective manner.

- **Conclusion**: Breakthroughs in the pathogenesis and evolution of PA illustrate why our thinking about this disease must remain flexible: PA is not a rare and uniform condition, but rather a common syndrome with protean manifestations.

- **Abbreviations**: A/C = cortisol-corrected aldosterone concentration; ACE = angiotensin-converting enzyme; APA = aldosterone-producing adenoma; APCC = aldosterone-producing cell cluster; ARB = angiotensin receptor blocker; ARR = aldosterone-to-renin ratio; AVS = adrenal venous sampling.

### Using renin activity to guide mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist therapy in patients with low renin and hypertension [^115JVAvN]. American Journal of Hypertension (2023). High credibility.

Of the 41 patients with suppressed renin treated with an MRA protocol to target unsuppressed renin, 39 patients had available information on baseline characteristics and outcomes and were included in the analysis. The median age of study patients was 67 years; all had hypertension, and the majority had diabetes. Most (30 out of 39; 76.9%) study patients were taking at least three antihypertensive medications prior to starting MRA therapy.

MRA therapy was titrated over a median of 59 (IQR 0–322) days, involving a mean of 3.6 (SD 3.9) titrations to the median dose of 50 (IQR 25–150) mg of spironolactone equivalent. Twelve (30.8%) patients were titrated to a spironolactone equivalent > 100 mg daily. Patients who achieved unsuppressed renin were titrated over a median of 54 (IQR 6.5–344) days, involving a median of 2.5 (IQR 1–4) titrations to the median dose of 50 (IQR 25–131.3) mg of spironolactone equivalent. The MRA dose required to achieve unsuppressed renin correlated with the baseline aldosterone levels. On average, the final MRA dose (in mg of spironolactone equivalents) needed to achieve unsuppressed renin was approximately 25 + 5*x, where x is the baseline aldosterone level (in ng/dl).

### Chronic kidney disease in diabetes [^116pAC2N]. Canadian Journal of Diabetes (2018). High credibility.

For patients with diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease (CKD), the 2018 guidelines recommend the initiation of ACE inhibitors or direct renin inhibitors. These renin-angiotensin system inhibitors are suggested to delay the progression of CKD in adult patients who also have either hypertension or albuminuria.

### Plasma renin and outcome in the community: Data from PREVEND [^116CA9U8]. European Heart Journal (2012). Low credibility.

The renin-angiotensin system plays a central role in patients with established cardiovascular (CV) disease, but the prognostic effect of plasma renin in the community is unclear.

- **Methods and results**: The relationship between plasma renin concentration and CV events was studied in 6,228 subjects enrolled in the Prevention of REnal and Vascular ENd-stage Disease (PREVEND) study who were not using antihypertensive medication. Plasma renin concentration was measured using a direct automated immunochemiluminescent assay. The mean (± SD) age was 47 (± 12) years, with 49% of subjects being male; the mean follow-up was 10.5 years. The median (Q1-Q3) plasma renin was 17.6 (10.9–27.2) µIU/mL, and plasma aldosterone was 119 (93–153) ng/L. The primary outcome was a composite of fatal (n = 27) and non-fatal (n = 408) CV events. Adjusted for age and sex, each doubling of plasma renin was associated with a hazard ratio (HR) for the primary outcome of 1.22 (95% CI: 1.04–1.43; P = 0.015). In a multivariable model, plasma renin showed a positive correlation with heart rate and male sex and a negative correlation with blood pressure, urinary sodium, glucose, and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-pro-BNP) (adjusted R²: 0.167, P < 0.001). After adjustment for covariates associated with plasma renin, the HR for reaching the primary outcome was 1.28 (95% CI: 1.09–1.49, P = 0.002). Plasma renin was associated with CV events regardless of blood pressure; however, in subjects using antihypertensive medication, this association was absent.

### Novel approach to establishing an aldosterone: renin ratio cutoff for primary aldosteronism [^111hrmSu]. Hypertension (2017). Low credibility.

Direct renin concentration is replacing plasma renin activity in many laboratories for the investigation of primary aldosteronism, which may have a significant impact on the resulting aldosterone:renin ratios. We sought to develop a population-based approach to establishing an aldosterone:renin ratio cutoff when transitioning between assays. A population-based study was performed in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, involving 4301 individuals who received testing from January 2012 to November 2015. In 2014, direct renin concentration replaced plasma renin activity in routine testing. We described the prevalence of primary aldosteronism in our population before the change and, using the assumption of disease prevalence stability, determined the corresponding ratio cutoffs after the introduction of the new assay.

During the initial portion of the study (using plasma renin activity), 4.9% of those screened were classified as highly probable cases, whereas 10.4% were considered probable and 28.9% possible using locally validated cutoffs. Aldosterone:renin ratio cutoffs were then determined for the direct renin concentration assay. A highly probable case of primary aldosteronism corresponded to a cutoff of > 100 pmol L^-1 mIU^-1 L^-1 with hypokalemia. A probable case corresponded to a cutoff of > 100, and a possible case to > 35 pmol L^-1 mIU^-1 L^-1. In contrast, cutoffs derived using a conversion factor resulted in significantly higher cutoffs and the potential for missed cases.

In conclusion, using large population data, historically consistent aldosterone:renin ratio cutoffs can be established.

### Primary aldosteronism [^111KrBWa]. American Family Physician (2023). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for primary aldosteronism, specifically with respect to indications for testing hypertension, the AAFP 2023 guidelines recommend measuring plasma aldosterone concentration and plasma renin levels simultaneously in the initial case detection for PA. Recognizing that aldosterone elevation with suppressed renin levels identifies patients with potential PA.

The KDIGO 2024 guidelines provide recommendations for the medical management of chronic kidney disease, particularly in relation to RAAS inhibitors such as ACEis and ARBs. It is advised to consider initiating renin-angiotensin-system inhibitors, either ACEi or ARB, in patients with CKD who have normal to mildly increased albuminuria (A1) for specific indications, such as the treatment of hypertension or heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF).

### Renin and prorenin as biomarkers in hypertension [^113N1Cxq]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2012). Low credibility.

This review examines the evidence that plasma renin and/or prorenin level may be used to guide therapy in hypertension and as an independent risk factor for future cardiovascular events.

- **Recent findings**: A large number of retrospective analyses of patient populations in clinical trials, in whom 'baseline' renin measurements were available, supports that high renin, but not high prorenin levels, are indicative of future cardiovascular disease and death, particularly in patients with kidney dysfunction and/or hypertension. The relationship is not affected by the use of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blockers. High renin levels also tend to support the use of RAS inhibitors as first-choice antihypertensive agents. However, the added value of a renin measurement on top of traditional risk factors is modest, and the pressure response to RAS blockade, even in high-renin patients, varies widely.

In summary, measuring 'baseline' renin as a marker of future cardiovascular events or to determine the choice of drug is of limited value in an individual patient.

### Renin: Friend or foe [^115Ehyge]. Heart (2007). Low credibility.

Renin maintains blood pressure through vasoconstriction when there is inadequate salt to maintain volume. In populations where blood pressure is more often high than low, and vascular death more common than hemorrhage or dehydration, therapeutic reductions in renin secretion or response are valuable. Whether long-term benefits are due entirely to blood pressure reduction remains unproved.

The pathway can be blocked at its rate-limiting step, such as beta blockade or direct renin inhibition, the synthesis of the active product, angiotensin II, or at the receptor for angiotensin. Because renin and sodium are the two main factors in blood pressure control, and renin levels vary inversely with sodium load, blood pressure control requires a combination of natriuresis and blocking the consequential increase in renin activity.

Being a large and stable molecule, renin is among the easiest and cheapest of hormone measurements. Understanding the simple biochemistry and physiology of renin permits optimal use of the drugs acting to raise or suppress this hormone.

### Analysis of screening and confirmatory tests in the diagnosis of primary aldosteronism: Need for a standardized protocol [^116cir4h]. Journal of Hypertension (2006). Low credibility.

The upright serum aldosterone/upright plasma renin activity ratio (ARR) has been recommended as a screening tool for the diagnosis of primary aldosteronism.

- **Objective**: We reviewed the data collected from hypertensive patients to retrospectively define the cut-off values and evaluate the reliability of the ARR and the saline infusion test in diagnosing primary aldosteronism.

- **Patients**: In 157 patients referred to our unit with suspected primary aldosteronism, 61 had confirmed cases — 26 with aldosterone-producing adenoma (APA) and 35 with idiopathic hyperaldosteronism. We calculated the supine and upright ARR, and the ARR after the administration of captopril and losartan, and analyzed the results of the saline infusion test.

- **Results**: Choosing 40 as the cut-off value, the upright ARR demonstrated 100% sensitivity and 84.4% specificity. The post-captopril and post-losartan ARR were slightly more specific, although at the cost of lower sensitivity. A cut-off value of 7 ng/dl for serum aldosterone at the end of the saline infusion, in patients with an upright ARR of 40, offered 100% specificity and a positive predictive value. Additionally, APA patients exhibited increased mean levels of the aldosterone/cortisol ratio after the saline infusion test.

- **Conclusion**: Our data reinforce the superiority of a standardized upright ARR as a screening test in diagnosing primary aldosteronism, identifying 40 as an ideal cut-off value. A serum aldosterone level of 7 ng/dl during saline infusion confirms the diagnosis, demonstrating the test's utility for confirmation.

### Using renin activity to guide mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist therapy in patients with low renin and hypertension [^115KkoM8]. American Journal of Hypertension (2023). Low credibility.

While primary aldosteronism (PA) is often categorized as a discrete condition, recent evidence indicates that PA exists across a broad continuum of pathophysiology, thereby blurring the distinction between PA and low-renin hypertension (LRH). It is widely accepted that mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) can be used for the treatment of PA, particularly for patients with non-lateralizing PA, those who are not interested in surgery, or in settings where surgery may not be available or feasible.

However, there are few published studies on the optimal approach to MRA therapy, and there is no consensus about biochemical treatment targets in MRA therapy of PA. Recent literature indicates that MRA therapy in PA is associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular disease, but only when treatment results in a substantial rise in renin, from a suppressed to an unsuppressed state. However, how to accomplish this in a safe and effective manner is not well understood.

We, therefore, conducted a retrospective study that evaluated an approach to the treatment of patients with LRH or probable PA using MRAs, which involves the gradual titration of MRAs targeting unsuppressed renin. We hypothesized that this approach would be associated with a decrease in blood pressure and/or proteinuria in a safe manner.

### Maintenance of blood pressure by reactive increases in plasma renin activity during salt depletion and renin-angiotensin system inhibition [^112xwcys]. Journal of Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

The commentary also draws attention to the relevance of data that support our hypotheses that a PRA level below 0.65 ng/ml/h does not lead to a vasoconstrictor effect and that the vasoconstrictor effect of a PRA level above 4.5 ng/ml/h is incompletely blocked by clinical doses of RAS inhibitors. Clinical trials are needed to address both issues. Nonetheless, these hypotheses can account for the observation that RAS inhibitors are less effective antihypertensive agents in patients with low PRA levels, and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality is higher in patients with preexisting CVD who develop high PRA levels during treatment with a RAS inhibitor.

### Effects of ramipril on the aldosterone/renin ratio and the aldosterone/angiotensin II ratio in patients with primary aldosteronism [^1155wk7z]. Hypertension (2020). Low credibility.

The aldosterone/renin ratio (ARR) is currently considered the most reliable approach for case detection of primary aldosteronism (PA). ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) inhibitors are known to raise renin and lower aldosterone levels, thereby causing false-negative ARR results. Because ACE inhibitors lower angiotensin II levels, we hypothesized that the aldosterone/equilibrium angiotensin II (eqAngII) ratio (AA2R) would remain elevated in PA.

Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis involving 60 patients with PA and 40 patients without PA revealed that the AA2R was not inferior to the ARR in screening for PA. When using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry to measure plasma aldosterone concentration, the predicted optimal AA2R cutoff for PA screening was 8.3 (pmol/L)/(pmol/L).

We then compared the diagnostic performance of the AA2R with the ARR among 25 patients with PA administered ramipril (5 mg/day) for 2 weeks. Compared with baseline, plasma levels of equilibrium angiotensin I (eqAngI) and direct renin concentration increased significantly (P < 0.01 or P < 0.05) after ramipril treatment, whereas eqAngII and ACE activity (eqAngII/eqAngI) decreased significantly (P < 0.01). The changes in plasma renin activity and plasma aldosterone concentration in the study were not significant.

On day 14, four patients displayed false-negative results using ARR_direct renin concentration (plasma aldosterone concentration/direct renin concentration), three of whom also showed false-negative ARR_plasma renin activity (plasma aldosterone concentration/plasma renin activity).

### Familial hyperaldosteronism: An European Reference Network on Rare Endocrine Conditions clinical practice guideline [^115vCU2G]. European Journal of Endocrinology (2024). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for primary aldosteronism, more specifically with respect to the plasma aldosterone-to-renin ratio, the Endo-ERN 2024 guidelines recommend obtaining the plasma aldosterone-to-renin ratio as the initial screening test for familial hyperaldosteronism.

### Therapeutic perspectives in hypertension: Novel means for renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system modulation and emerging device-based approaches [^11599yQN]. European Heart Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Despite recent advances in the treatment of hypertension, the majority of patients remain not optimally controlled; hence, there is a need for innovative strategies to lower blood pressure (BP). The BP target values are fairly aggressive, often requiring the addition of a fourth or fifth agent. This approach can tax the imagination of even the most skilled physician and reduce drug compliance in a large proportion of patients.

- **Evaluation of antihypertensive therapy**: Any innovation in antihypertensive therapy is typically judged based on the ability to improve BP control, effectiveness in treatment-resistant hypertension, and potential for further risk reduction. This encompasses impact on associated functional, metabolic, and structural alterations. While this issue is highly debated, most opinions lean towards tight BP control rather than a specific treatment strategy.

- **Novel approaches**: Novel approaches to hypertension treatment include: (i) drug-based strategies targeting traditional neurohumoral pathways, such as the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS), or less-studied pathways like endothelin or renalase; (ii) unique approaches involving gene and vaccine therapies; and (iii) device-based therapies, such as baroreceptor sensitization or renal nerve ablation.

We provide an overview of various therapies in development and outline prospects for how and which of them might impact clinical care.

### Treating primary aldosteronism-induced hypertension: Novel approaches and future outlooks [^115nYVTw]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). Low credibility.

The field of primary aldosteronism (PA) research is progressing rapidly and yielding significant advances that are already being transitioned into the clinical arena. This raises the hope that many more patients will soon benefit from earlier diagnosis, more effective clinical, laboratory, and radiological phenotyping, and the development of a personalized management strategy.

The past decade, in particular, has established PA as the major, potentially reversible, secondary cause of hypertension. It has provided novel insights into the underlying pathogenesis of this heterogeneous disorder, improved and more robust assays for the measurement of plasma renin and aldosterone, and major advances in molecular imaging that permit not just lateralization but precise localization of culprit lesions. Additionally, insights (albeit in limited circumstances) have been provided for adrenal sparing interventions. In parallel, the arrival of more effective medical therapies should allow more effective prevention and mitigation of the adverse effects associated with hyperaldosteronism in patients for whom other interventions are not feasible or preferred.

### Primary aldosteronism: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^115bXNhZ]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for primary aldosteronism, more specifically with respect to the plasma aldosterone-to-renin ratio, the ES 2025 guidelines recommend obtaining serum/plasma aldosterone concentration and plasma renin (concentration or activity). Determining the aldosterone-to-renin ratio is advised to screen for primary aldosteronism in patients with hypertension.

### The clinical impact of sample storage at -20 °C on renin reference intervals and aldosterone-renin ratio calculations [^111zompz]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Low credibility.

To ensure reliable and clinically relevant renin levels and ARR for screening and diagnosis of PA, it is recommended that studies on renin and ARR measurements provide detailed information regarding sample collection and storage conditions, such as temperature and duration. By taking appropriate precautions to prevent cryoactivation through correct sample handling and storage, it is expected that intraindividual and interindividual variations in renin measurements will be reduced, leading to enhanced reliability and clinical utility of the ARR in PA diagnosis.

Even when samples for renin measurements are stored at −80 °C, the RI used by the laboratories may be determined based on experiments with inappropriate preanalytical storage conditions. To investigate how RI studies have been executed since 2016, we conducted a search in PubMed for studies defining renin RIs, focusing on those studies' sample collection, transport, and storage conditions. We identified nine studies defining RIs, in different age groups, for renin concentration or activity. Most of the studies utilized room temperature during sample handling and centrifugation. Only four studies mentioned the temperature at which the samples were stored before analyses and none of the studies provided information regarding the conditions of sample transport. Three studies did not give any information about sample preparation, transport, and storage conditions. Only two of the nine studies stored plasma samples in −80°C freezers; in one study, the samples were handled for eight hours under unspecified conditions.

### Newly developed renin and prorenin assays and the clinical evaluation of renin inhibitors [^113FiJ18]. Journal of Hypertension (2008). Low credibility.

The last decade has seen the introduction of renin inhibitors and new plasma renin and prorenin assays, which has led to a better understanding of the tissue renin-angiotensin system.

- **Aim of the study**: To clarify the consequences of these developments for the methodology and interpretation of measurements of renin and prorenin.

- **Methods**: The principles and application of the newly developed immunosorbent assays (ISAs) are surveyed, and the results are compared with those of enzyme-kinetic assays (EKAs).

- **Results and conclusions**: Angiotensin (Ang) II in cardiac, renal, and adrenal tissue is known to originate mainly from locally produced Ang I. Experimental evidence and theoretical considerations show that a simple relationship between Ang II receptor occupancy in tissue micromilieu and the circulating levels of Ang II or renin may not exist. This supports the clinicians' view that the plasma level of renin tells more about the mechanisms regulating its release into the circulation than about the Ang II-dependency of hypertension. ISAs are a welcome addition to clinical studies of renin inhibitors. By comparing the results of ISAs with those of EKAs, the inhibitor-bound forms of renin and prorenin can be distinguished from the unbound forms. ISAs also provide important information on the molecular basis of prorenin activation. We propose a single kinetic model to incorporate the conformational changes of prorenin induced by cryo-activation and acid-activation, and by binding to renin inhibitors. It explains why renin ISAs can overestimate the rise of renin in response.

### 2022 AHA/ACC/HFSA guideline for the management of heart failure: A report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^117XnBu6]. Circulation (2022). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for heart failure, especially concerning renin-angiotensin system inhibitors, the ACC/AHA/HFSA 2022 guidelines recommend switching to an ARNi to further reduce morbidity and mortality in patients with chronic symptomatic HFrEF NYHA class II-III who are tolerating ACEis or ARBs.

### Primary aldosteronism: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^114smf9G]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for primary aldosteronism, particularly concerning the plasma aldosterone-to-renin ratio, the ES 2025 guidelines recommend repeating the test if the patient's initial screen is positive but they are receiving medications such as β-blockers and centrally acting α-2 agonists (clonidine and α-methyldopa) that can lower renin and cause false-positive results. Withdraw these medications for 2 weeks if it is safe and feasible.

- **Consider potential false positives**: Induced by β-blockers when aldosterone is 10–15 ng/dL (277–416 pmol/L) by immunoassay or 7.5–10 ng/dL (208–277 pmol/L) by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.

Recognize that primary aldosteronism is likely if aldosterone is above these concentrations despite the patient being on β-blockers.

### Treating primary aldosteronism-induced hypertension: Novel approaches and future outlooks [^1149UBa9]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). Low credibility.

- **Figure 1 - Traditional approach to diagnosis and management**: Initial diagnosis is determined by a positive aldosterone–renin ratio (ARR) screen with at least one positive confirmatory test. This is discussed in the section "Screening, Diagnosis, and the Spectrum of Disease". Following diagnosis, subtype diagnosis (i.e. lateralization) is sought through the use of adrenal imaging/adrenal vein sampling (AVS), discussed in "Approach to Lateralization". Unilateral disease is commonly treated with adrenalectomy of the diseased adrenal whereas, in cases of bilateral disease, mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) antagonists are commonly prescribed. This is discussed further in "Advances in Pharmacotherapy".

- **Figure 2 - Current 'roadblocks' in PA care and suggested approaches**:
	1. Improved screening for, and diagnosis of, PA through the application of metabolomics and machine learning.
	2. Utilization of advanced lateralization techniques, including molecular (functional) imaging to allow precise tumor localization.
	3. Use of focal adrenal-sparing interventions, such as adrenal-sparing surgery or thermal ablation, where appropriate.
	4. Continued development of more selective pharmacological agents.

Overall, screening rates for PA are low. Despite the guidelines of the Endocrine Society and the American Heart Association, a population-based retrospective cohort study in Canada reported a screening rate of only 3.9% of all patients with hypokalemia (K+ < 3.0 mEq/L) and hypertension, and 1% of patients who were on four or more antihypertensive agents.

### Treating primary aldosteronism-induced hypertension: Novel approaches and future outlooks [^117PJN7o]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). Low credibility.

Challenges in screening for primary aldosteronism (PA) are significant, as the condition remains underdiagnosed and undertreated in clinical practice. The principal barriers to effective management are found in the screening and diagnosis processes, with traditional workflows for diagnosis and treatment of PA highlighted in Figures 1 and 2. Currently, there is no consensus on recommended screening for PA in individuals with hypertension, whether in primary or secondary care settings.

The Endocrine Society guidelines for the diagnosis and management of PA recommend screening up to 50% of "at-risk" patients for this condition. Screening should be conducted using the aldosterone–renin ratio (ARR), with particular attention given to patients with the following conditions:

- **Severe hypertension**: A critical indicator for screening.
- **Hypertension with spontaneous or diuretic-induced hypokalemia**: This should prompt additional investigation.
- **Adrenal mass presence**: Warrants further evaluation for PA.
- **Sleep apnea**: Linked to risk factors for PA.
- **Family history of early-onset hypertension**: Suggests a genetic predisposition.
- **Early-age stroke**: Increases suspicion for PA.
- **First-degree relative with PA**: Strong familial link requiring consideration.

The American Heart Association guidelines for hypertension diagnosis and management align with the Endocrine Society's recommendations concerning recognized risk factors for PA screening. In contrast, the European Society of Cardiology and European Society of Hypertension guidelines do not emphasize screening for PA, except in patients with treatment-resistant hypertension, a group that comprises approximately 5% of all patients.

Some national guidelines, such as those of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in the UK, do not specifically reference screening for PA in their hypertension management protocols.

### Dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin system: The ultimate treatment for renal protection [^113g4qSq]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2005). Low credibility.

The prevalence of chronic renal diseases is increasing worldwide. There is a great need to identify therapies that arrest disease progression to end-stage renal failure. Inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system, both by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor antagonists, is probably the best therapeutic option available. Several large, multicenter studies have shown a significant reduction in the risk for doubling baseline serum creatinine or progression toward end-stage renal failure in patients who do and do not have diabetes and have chronic nephropathies treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor antagonists. However, the number of patients who reach end-stage renal failure is still considerably high. Significant reduction of the incidence of ESRD is likely to be achieved in the near future for chronic nephropathies, provided that the degree of renoprotection can be improved. This goal may be attainable with a more complex strategy than with a single or dual pharmacologic intervention on the renin-angiotensin system. Strict control of BP and protein excretion rate, lowering of blood lipids, tight glucose control for individuals with diabetes, and lifestyle changes form part of the future multimodal protocol for the treatment of patients with chronic nephropathies.

### Renin-angiotensin system blockers may create more risk than reward for sodium-depleted cardiovascular patients with high plasma renin levels [^112NekY7]. American Journal of Hypertension (2013). Low credibility.

Four recent reports revealed differences in survival rates among treated cardiovascular patients taking renin-angiotensin system-blocking drugs. Patients with higher on-treatment plasma renin activity (PRA) levels experienced higher mortality rates due to cardiovascular causes than those with lower PRA levels. We investigated whether excessive sodium depletion might have induced the higher PRA levels and contributed to the increased morbidity and mortality.

- **Methods**: Using published data, ranges of PRA, blood pressures, drug usage, and biochemical parameters were compared among various groups of cardiovascular patients.

- **Results**: We demonstrated (i) that PRA levels are usually medium to low in treated cardiovascular patients, but sometimes abnormally high; (ii) that excessive sodium depletion can induce such high PRA levels; (iii) that patients with higher PRA exhibited evidence of sodium depletion: lower blood pressures, more frequent use of natriuretic drugs, lower N-terminal pro b-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), and higher blood urea nitrogen and uric acid levels, despite similar usage of renin-angiotensin blocking drugs.

- **Conclusions**: We hypothesize that patients with high on-treatment PRA levels succumb sooner to cardiovascular events due to excessive sodium-volume depletion. Furthermore, renin-angiotensin system-blocking drugs may be detrimental in such patients as they can interfere with the reactive rises in PRA, which are triggered to prevent potentially dangerous decreases in blood pressure, increases in plasma potassium, and declines in glomerular filtration rate.

### Therapeutic perspectives in hypertension: novel means for renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system modulation and emerging device-based approaches [^114iQrsw]. European Heart Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Renin, catalyzing the rate-limiting step in the RAAS cascade, represents a highly attractive therapeutic target. This was recently exploited by the introduction of the first-in-class selective renin inhibitor, aliskiren. Renin inhibition is indeed associated with the attenuation of Ang I and Ang II levels and blood pressure (BP) reduction. Aliskiren reduced BP comparably to β-blockers, diuretics, ACE inhibitors, and AT1R blockers. The potential benefit of renin inhibition may reside in the attenuation of plasma renin activity, which is increased by ACE inhibition or AT1R blockade. However, elevated renin levels following aliskiren treatment might escape from renin inhibition, and aliskiren may not prevent the binding of renin to the (P)RR.

A large clinical study program named Aspire Higher is currently underway to determine whether aliskiren treatment ameliorates target-organ damage and positively affects cardiovascular (CV) morbidity and mortality.

The far from optimal pharmacokinetic properties of aliskiren (2–7% bioavailability) and a ceiling dose of 300 mg daily (due to gastrointestinal irritation) invite the development of novel agents in this class.

### Diagnostic approach to low-renin hypertension [^112hDuHt]. Clinical Endocrinology (2018). Low credibility.

The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) plays a crucial role in maintaining water and electrolyte homeostasis, and its deregulation contributes to the development of arterial hypertension. Since the historical description of the "classical" RAAS, there has been a dramatic increase in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the development of both essential and secondary hypertension. Approximately 25% of patients affected by arterial hypertension display low-renin levels, a definition that is largely arbitrary and depends on the investigated population and the specific characteristics of the assay.

Most often, low-renin levels are an expression of a physiological response to sodium-volume overload, but a significant number of secondary hereditary or acquired conditions also fall within this category. In a context of suppressed renin status, the concomitant examination of plasma aldosterone levels (which can be inappropriately elevated, within the normal range, or suppressed) and plasma potassium levels are essential to formulate a differential diagnosis. Differentiating between the different forms of low-renin hypertension is of fundamental importance in directing the patient to proper clinical management, as each subtype requires specific and targeted therapy.

This review discusses the differential diagnosis of the most common medical conditions manifesting with a clinical phenotype of low-renin hypertension, highlighting the novelties in genetics of familial forms.

### Update on low-renin hypertension: Current understanding and future direction [^115Ewkok]. Hypertension (2024). Low credibility.

Low-renin hypertension is common and affects 1 in 4 people with hypertension. Understanding the different causes and management of low-renin hypertension is becoming increasingly relevant as renin measurements are more widely ordered in clinical practice. Importantly, many people with low-renin hypertension do not fit traditional definitions of known causes, and the approach to the management of these people is unclear. This review provides an overview of our evolving understanding of the causes of low-renin hypertension, the expanding spectra of pathophysiology, key differentiating characteristics, and distinct management strategies, and highlights our knowledge gaps. It is important to distinguish the underlying pathophysiology of an individual with low-renin hypertension to individualize treatment.

### The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and its therapeutic targets [^111Wsui5]. Experimental Eye Research (2019). High credibility.

The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) plays a pivotal role in the regulation of blood pressure and body fluid homeostasis and is a mainstay for the treatment of cardiovascular and renal diseases. Angiotensin II and aldosterone are the two most powerful biologically active products of the RAAS, inducing all of the classical actions of the RAAS, including vasoconstriction, sodium retention, tissue remodeling, and pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic effects. In recent years, new components of the RAAS have been discovered beyond the classical pathway. This has led to the identification of depressor or so-called protective RAAS pathways and the development of novel therapies targeting this system.

Moreover, dual inhibitors, which block the RAAS and other systems involved in the regulation of blood pressure or target upstream of angiotensin II by selectively deleting liver-derived angiotensinogen, the precursor to all angiotensins, may provide superior treatment for cardiovascular and renal diseases and revolutionize RAAS-targeting therapy.

### Evolution of the primary aldosteronism syndrome: Updating the approach [^116F42LE]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). High credibility.

New approaches are needed to address the evolution of the primary aldosteronism syndrome and to increase its recognition. Herein, we review evidence indicating that primary aldosteronism is a prevalent syndrome that is mostly unrecognized and present a pragmatic and pathophysiology-based approach to improve diagnosis and treatment.

- **Methods**: Evidence was gathered from published guidelines and studies identified from PubMed by searching for primary aldosteronism, aldosterone, renin, and hypertension. This evidence was supplemented by the authors' personal knowledge, research experience, and clinical encounters in primary aldosteronism.

- **Interpretation of evidence**: Renin-independent aldosterone production is a prevalent phenotype that is diagnosed as primary aldosteronism when severe in magnitude but is largely unrecognized when milder in severity. This production can be detected in normotensive and hypertensive individuals. The magnitude of this biochemical phenotype parallels the magnitude of blood pressure elevation, the risk for incident hypertension and cardiovascular disease, and the likelihood and magnitude of blood pressure reduction with mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist therapy. Expansion of the indications to screen for primary aldosteronism, combined with the use of a pathophysiology-based approach that emphasizes inappropriate aldosterone production in the context of renin suppression, will substantially increase the diagnostic and therapeutic yields for primary aldosteronism.

### Preventing end-stage renal disease: Flexible strategies to overcome obstacles [^112ULpC1]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2006). Low credibility.

Renin-angiotensin system inhibition has demonstrated effectiveness in clinical studies in slowing the progression of chronic kidney disease. This review analyzes obstacles that have hindered the attainment of optimal results in the renal community and the need for flexible strategies in overcoming these obstacles.

Despite the publication of the beneficial effects of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors, an epidemic of end-stage renal disease has developed in the United States. Underprescription of these medicines and failure to reach goals for blood pressure and urinary protein loss have contributed to this epidemic. Solutions to these problems require flexible analysis that contrasts with the more linear, rigid approaches recently popularized in various disease-management guidelines. The application of renin-angiotensin inhibitors in an individualized, goal-oriented manner sensitive to patient variations is discussed. A similar approach to hypertension, emphasizing assessment of individual hemodynamic parameters, is proposed. The elimination of rigid limitations to increases in serum potassium and serum creatinine is suggested as a means to enhance the prescription of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors.

Optimal treatment of chronic kidney disease requires flexible approaches towards achieving the goals for systolic blood pressure and reduction of urinary protein loss.

### Primary aldosteronism: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^1143zvR8]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for primary aldosteronism, especially in relation to the plasma aldosterone-to-renin ratio, the ES 2025 guidelines recommend repeating the test on a different day if the patient's initial screening is negative, and the pretest probability of primary aldosteronism is moderate to high. This is particularly applicable in cases of hypokalemia and/or resistant hypertension, or if renin is suppressed with aldosterone levels of 5–10 ng/dL (138–277 pmol/L) by immunoassay.

### Standards of care in diabetes — 2025 [^111cLeL3]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of diabetes mellitus type 2, specifically in the management of diabetic nephropathy, the ADA 2025 guidelines recommend the initiation of either an ACE inhibitor (ACEi) or an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) in nonpregnant patients with diabetes and hypertension. This is particularly for those with severely increased albuminuria, indicated by a urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio of ≥ 300 mg/g creatinine, and/or an eGFR of < 60 mL/min/1.73 m². The medication should be titrated to the maximally tolerated dose to prevent the progression of kidney disease and reduce cardiovascular events.

### Using renin activity to guide mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist therapy in patients with low renin and hypertension [^114BJP1M]. American Journal of Hypertension (2023). High credibility.

Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) are often empirically used for patients with low-renin hypertension (LRH) or probable primary aldosteronism (PA) who decline surgery. However, the optimal approach to MRA therapy is unknown. Studies have shown that a rise in renin is an effective biomarker for the prevention of cardiovascular complications of PA. This study aimed to determine whether empiric MRA therapy in patients with LRH or probable PA targeting unsuppressed renin is associated with a decrease in blood pressure and/or proteinuria.

- **Methods**: Retrospective single-center cohort study from 2005 to 2021 included adults with LRH or probable PA (renin activity 10 ng/dl) or low (< 10 ng/dl) aldosterone levels. The majority (24/39; 61.5%) of patients had at least one baseline antihypertensive medication stopped. Among the six patients who had detectable proteinuria and albumin-to-creatinine (ACR) measurements post-treatment, the mean ACR decreased from 179.0 to 36.1 mg/g (P = 0.03). None of the patients studied had to completely stop treatment due to adverse reactions.

Empiric MRA therapy in patients with LRH or probable PA targeting unsuppressed renin was effective.

### Prenatally diagnosed unilateral hydronephrosis: prognostic significance of plasma renin activity [^111iuhMX]. The Journal of Urology (2007). Low credibility.

Controversy surrounds the optimal management of prenatally diagnosed hydronephrosis due to technical limitations in accurately quantifying the degree of obstruction at the ureteropelvic junction. These patients are regularly investigated for ureteropelvic junction obstruction, severe abdominal pain, abdominal lump, and deterioration in renal function. In this descriptive study, we quantify plasma renin activity as an additional measure to evaluate renal outcome.

- **Materials and methods**: In 90 consecutive children with prenatally diagnosed unilateral hydronephrosis, an association was sought between changes in plasma renin activity, split renal function, glomerular filtration rate, and serum creatinine. Patients with split renal function less than 35% at presentation were excluded from the study. The mean follow-up was 50.1 ± 15.9 months (range 24 to 87). Pyeloplasty was performed if patients became symptomatic or split renal function decreased more than 10% during follow-up.

- **Results**: An increase in plasma renin activity and a decrease in split renal function and glomerular filtration rate were noted in patients being followed nonoperatively (40 patients) and in those requiring pyeloplasty (50). However, these parameters were more pronounced in the operated group. In the latter group, plasma renin activity increased by 64.7% between initial (15.9 ng) and preoperative (26.2 ng) values and became normal postoperatively. In nonoperatively followed patients, plasma renin activity continued to increase until the last follow-up.

- **Conclusions**: Plasma renin activity progressively increases in this context.

### Using renin activity to guide mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist therapy in patients with low renin and hypertension [^114ASVYX]. American Journal of Hypertension (2023). Low credibility.

The present study had a number of strengths. It included an unselected patient population that was treated with a uniform protocol. It offers a pragmatic approach that utilizes tests that are widely available in primary care settings and off-patent medications. Finally, the study found effects that were so considerably pronounced that they were highly statistically significant even in a relatively small population.

The findings presented in this study should be interpreted in light of its limitations. In the absence of a control group, the study cannot make any causal claims. The sample size was relatively small. However, because the effects of MRA therapy were nearly uniform, the findings were robust. Since data collected in this analysis came from a single center and the practice of a single physician in Eastern Massachusetts, the results may not be generalizable to other settings. Formal testing for PA was not conducted; however, this was deliberate, as the patients opted for pragmatic medical therapy. Other factors that could have affected renin levels (e.g. dietary sodium content or genotype) were not evaluated. The sample size was too small to evaluate the potential effects of concomitant beta-blocker use. Most patients also could not stop all their non-MRA anti-hypertensive drugs (sometimes because of indications not related to treatment of hypertension), which could influence the explanatory component on blood pressure and renin measures from MRA therapy. We also do not have information on the laboratory methodologic data on the assays used to measure aldosterone.

### Evolving role of aldosterone blockers alone and in combination with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers in hypertension management: a review of mechanistic and clinical data [^113Rehrq]. American Heart Journal (2004). Low credibility.

The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) plays an integral role in blood pressure regulation and has long been a target of pharmacologic approaches to controlling blood pressure. Traditionally, clinical interventions involving the RAAS have focused mainly on inhibiting the action of angiotensin II with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers, and limited attention has been devoted to direct inhibition of the action of aldosterone. Recent advances in understanding the role of aldosterone in cardiovascular injury have elevated the importance of direct inhibition of the action of this hormone in the long-term control of blood pressure and have led to the development of the selective aldosterone blocker eplerenone. This article reviews the role of the RAAS in the development of hypertension and discusses the rationale for the use of eplerenone with other medications affecting the RAAS to control blood pressure.

### Management of hypertensive crises: The scientific basis for treatment decisions [^112tyNYF]. American Journal of Hypertension (2001). Low credibility.

The spectrum of disorders associated with an elevated blood pressure (BP) encompasses chronic uncomplicated hypertension and hypertensive crises, including hypertensive urgencies and emergencies. Although these syndromes vary widely in their presentations, clinical courses, and outcomes, they share pathophysiologic mechanisms and, consequently, therapeutic responses to specifically targeted antihypertensive drug types.

Nevertheless, hypertensive crises are often treated with drugs that are either unsafe in that setting or have unsubstantiated efficacy. The purpose of this review is to examine the pathophysiology of commonly encountered hypertensive crises, such as stroke, hypertensive encephalopathy, aortic dissection, acute pulmonary edema, and preeclampsia-eclampsia; and to provide a rational approach to their treatment based upon relevant pathophysiologic and pharmacologic principles.

Measurement of plasma renin activity (PRA) level often provides insight regarding pathophysiology and predicts the efficacy of antihypertensive treatments in the individual patient. However, in hypertensive crises, drug therapy is initiated before the PRA level is known. Nevertheless, the renin-angiotensin dependence (R-type) or volume dependence (V-type) of hypertension can often be deduced by the BP response to drugs that interrupt the renin system (R-drugs) or that decrease body volume (V-drugs). Based upon these considerations, a treatment algorithm is provided to guide drug selection in patients presenting with a hypertensive crisis.

### Diagnosis and treatment of low-renin hypertension [^115Rnv37]. Clinical Endocrinology (2007). Low credibility.

Plasma renin levels can be used to classify hypertension. A significant proportion of hypertensive individuals display a low-renin profile, and thus, low-renin hypertension (LRH) requires appropriate diagnosis and treatment. LRH includes essential, secondary, and genetic forms, the most common of which are low-renin essential hypertension and primary aldosteronism. Several studies have investigated the relationship between plasma renin activity (PRA) status and clinical response to different antihypertensive therapies. This review will discuss the differential diagnosis of LRH subtypes and the most appropriate treatment options based on the pathophysiological background of this condition.

### Approach to the patient: Reninoma [^116E1sad]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Low credibility.

Secondary hyperaldosteronism, also termed primary reninism by Conn et al, may be detected in screens for secondary hypertension. It is characterized by an elevated plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC) associated with an elevated plasma renin level, in contrast to the suppressed renin seen in the more common primary aldosteronism (PA).

Secondary hyperaldosteronism is triggered physiologically in hypovolemic states. Pathologically, hypertensive forms of secondary hyperaldosteronism are exemplified by renal vascular hypertension (RVH) or reninoma. Other states mimicking mineralocorticoid excess have been described, but specific examples are not provided in this text excerpt.

### Primary aldosteronism: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^1114bPr4]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for primary aldosteronism, specifically concerning confirmatory testing, the ES 2025 guidelines recommend not requiring aldosterone suppression testing before initiating PA-specific therapy in the following situations:

- **Patients with resistant hypertension**: Do not obtain aldosterone suppression testing in patients with resistant hypertension or hypertension with hypokalemia and overt biochemical evidence of renin-independent aldosterone production, defined as plasma renin activity ≤ 0.2 ng/mL/h or direct renin concentration ≤ 2 mU/L and plasma aldosterone concentration ≥ 15 ng/dL (≥ 416 pmol/L) via liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry assay or ≥ 20 ng/dL (≥ 554 pmol/L) via immunoassay, due to the risk of false-negative results, which may exceed the risk of false-positive screening results.

- **Empirical treatment without suppression testing**: Consider empirically treating patients unwilling or unable to pursue adrenal venous sampling and adrenalectomy with mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists based on screening results, without aldosterone suppression testing. Recognize that aldosterone suppression testing may still provide value in some cases for further documenting the diagnosis.

- **Familial hyperaldosteronism cases**: Avoid obtaining aldosterone suppression testing in patients from families with germline mutations associated with familial hyperaldosteronism. Obtain genetic screening for all first-degree relatives of patients with familial hyperaldosteronism and for patients with young-onset PA (< 20 years) to enable early diagnosis and treatment.

- **Likelihood of lateralizing PA**: Avoid obtaining aldosterone suppression testing if the likelihood of lateralizing PA is high.
