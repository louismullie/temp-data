## Question

What are the differentials of sore throat , sensation of lump in throat, non productive cough, loss of appetite, and eye pain and headaches

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the differential diagnosis for sore throat, globus sensation, nonproductive cough, loss of appetite, and eye pain with headache. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to frame the symptom complex and identify red flags. Then, I should prioritize the differential by organ system and pathophysiology. Next, I will appraise the strength of evidence for each leading diagnosis. After that, I need to outline a staged diagnostic approach and highlight pitfalls. Finally, I will synthesize a concise, prioritized differential and note what would change my conclusions with new data.

> Let me first confirm the symptom cluster and its implications. Sore throat and globus point toward pharyngeal or laryngeal irritation or structural disease, while nonproductive cough suggests upper airway cough syndrome, laryngopharyngeal reflux, or a functional cough disorder. Loss of appetite is nonspecific but can accompany systemic infections, inflammatory disease, or malignancy. Eye pain with headache raises concern for rhinosinusitis, migraine, or a secondary headache disorder, and I should not miss temporal arteritis in older adults with new headache and visual symptoms [^65d2b5d4] [^1e87889a] [^b5263d0f].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I need to check for red flags that mandate urgent action: fever, dysphagia, odynophagia, weight loss, night sweats, hemoptysis, cranial neuropathies, focal neurologic deficits, or visual loss. These features push me toward expedited imaging, endoscopy, or specialty referral rather than watchful waiting [^5727509d] [^2b63b43d].

> Next, I should review infectious etiologies. COVID-19 remains common and can present with sore throat, cough, headache, and anosmia or ageusia; pooled sensitivity for sore throat is modest, so a negative symptom history does not exclude disease, and testing is prudent in the right epidemiologic context [^9799c32f] [^fad9e4f4]. Influenza can mimic this with abrupt onset of sore throat, nonproductive cough, headache, and systemic symptoms; children may have higher rates of gastrointestinal involvement, which can explain appetite change [^5c226e7c] [^acdaeada]. I should also consider mpox in the right risk context, as sore throat, cough, and cervical lymphadenopathy are prevalent otolaryngologic features in recent outbreaks [^da771daa].

> I will now examine upper airway and reflux-related causes. Laryngopharyngeal reflux is a leading consideration for globus, throat clearing, and nonproductive cough, but I need to remember that randomized data show limited benefit from PPIs for throat symptoms, so I should avoid reflexively attributing everything to reflux and instead pursue objective evaluation when alarm features are present or symptoms persist [^eb7773f7] [^5727509d]. Upper airway cough syndrome from allergic rhinitis or chronic rhinosinusitis can drive cough, throat irritation, and facial or periocular pain; I should confirm with history and exam and consider empiric therapy or imaging if red flags arise [^65d2b5d4] [^2ea9a89c].

> Let me consider functional and sensory disorders. Globus sensation is common and often multifactorial; after excluding structural disease, functional globus or irritable throat syndrome is reasonable, and management shifts to reassurance, neuromodulators, and behavioral therapy rather than repeated negative tests [^5727509d] [^dfa8e29f]. Unexplained chronic cough may reflect cough hypersensitivity syndrome, particularly post-viral, and responds poorly to acid suppression; speech therapy and neuromodulators are key options after excluding organic causes [^accc7003].

> But wait, what if the headache and eye pain signal something more serious. In adults over 50 with new headache, I should actively exclude giant cell arteritis, which can rarely present with sore throat and carries a risk of irreversible vision loss; prompt ESR/CRP and temporal artery evaluation are indicated when suspected [^b5263d0f]. Rhinosinusitis can cause facial and periocular pain with headache and may coexist with throat symptoms; orbital pain or diplopia warrants urgent evaluation for complications [^65d2b5d4]. Primary headache disorders such as migraine or tension-type headache remain common, but I should not anchor on them if secondary features are present [^1e87889a].

> I need to ensure I do not overlook structural or neoplastic causes. A neck mass with sore throat, dysphagia, or persistent globus merits expedited ENT evaluation; compressive thyroid disease, parapharyngeal tumors, and Zenker's diverticulum can mimic globus and require targeted imaging and endoscopy [^2b63b43d] [^8687c44b]. Foreign body or postsurgical airway injury can present with globus and cough; careful history and laryngoscopy are essential when the story fits [^ed243cee].

> Let me synthesize a prioritized differential. Most likely: viral upper respiratory infection including COVID-19 or influenza, with overlapping LPR or upper airway cough syndrome contributing to globus and cough. Next most likely: functional globus or irritable throat syndrome after exclusion of structural disease. Less likely but high consequence: giant cell arteritis in older adults, rhinosinusitis with complications, or malignancy when red flags are present. Rare but important: mpox in the right epidemiology, Lemierre's syndrome in adolescents and young adults with severe pharyngitis and systemic toxicity, and medication-induced cough or globus from ACE inhibitors or other agents [^9799c32f] [^5c226e7c] [^5727509d] [^b5263d0f] [^da771daa] [^1426b8c5].

> Next, I should review a staged diagnostic approach. Start with targeted history and exam to identify red flags and typical patterns. Obtain COVID-19 testing when epidemiologically or clinically indicated. If symptoms persist beyond 3–4 weeks or alarm features emerge, proceed with nasolaryngoscopy and consider ENT referral. If globus or dysphagia persist, esophageal evaluation with barium swallow or endoscopy is appropriate. Reserve brain or sinus imaging for focal neurologic signs, severe headache, or orbital symptoms. And in adults over 50 with new headache, order ESR/CRP to screen for temporal arteritis when suspected [^5727509d] [^65d2b5d4] [^b5263d0f].

> Hold on, I should verify key pitfalls. Do not over-attribute throat symptoms to reflux without objective evidence, especially given TOPPITS and related data. Do not miss GCA in older adults with new headache. And do not delay evaluation of a neck mass or progressive dysphagia, as these may signal malignancy. Maintaining diagnostic humility and reassessing the course over time helps avoid premature closure [^eb7773f7] [^b5263d0f] [^2b63b43d].

> In summary, the most coherent explanation for this symptom cluster is a viral upper respiratory process with concurrent LPR or upper airway cough syndrome and possible functional globus, but I must actively exclude giant cell arteritis in older adults, rhinosinusitis complications, and neoplasia when red flags are present. A staged, multidisciplinary approach anchored in history, selective testing, and timely specialty input balances overdiagnosis with safety [^5727509d] [^65d2b5d4] [^b5263d0f].

The most likely causes of sore throat, globus sensation, nonproductive cough, loss of appetite, and eye pain with headache are **viral upper respiratory infection** (including COVID-19 and influenza) [^fad9e4f4] [^5c226e7c], **laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR)** [^dac76213], and **allergic rhinitis with sinus involvement** [^2ea9a89c]. Other considerations include **mononucleosis** [^d8e95bdc], **early bacterial pharyngitis** [^1e803f54], and **migraine with ocular symptoms** [^1e87889a]. Red flags (dysphagia, weight loss, persistent fever, severe headache, visual changes) warrant urgent evaluation for serious causes such as epiglottitis, abscess, or giant cell arteritis [^700707c7] [^b5263d0f]. Initial workup should include a focused history and exam, COVID-19 testing when indicated [^fad9e4f4], and targeted labs or imaging if red flags are present [^5727509d].

## Infectious etiologies

### Viral upper respiratory infections (URIs)

- **COVID-19**: Sore throat, cough, headache, and ocular symptoms (conjunctivitis, eye pain) are common; anosmia/ageusia may be present [^fad9e4f4] [^6a921fb6].
- **Influenza**: Presents with sore throat, nonproductive cough, headache, and systemic symptoms; ocular pain can occur [^5c226e7c] [^acdaeada].
- **Common cold**: Sore throat, cough, headache, and mild ocular discomfort are typical [^1753efb4] [^fa6cdae3].

---

### Mononucleosis (Epstein-Barr virus)

Mononucleosis presents with **sore throat**, **fatigue**, **headache**, and **loss of appetite**; a globus sensation may occur due to tonsillar enlargement [^d8e95bdc].

---

### Bacterial pharyngitis

- **Group A Streptococcus**: Sudden sore throat, fever, headache, and abdominal pain are common; cough is typically absent [^e19c8bd7] [^2d54ac5a].
- **Early bacterial infection**: Nonproductive cough and globus may precede purulent sputum production [^notfound].

---

## Gastroesophageal and laryngopharyngeal reflux

Laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR) commonly causes **sore throat**, **globus sensation**, and **chronic nonproductive cough**; reflux-related inflammation can trigger headache and ocular surface irritation [^dac76213] [^c7bebbbe].

---

## Allergic rhinitis and sinus disease

Allergic rhinitis causes **postnasal drip**, **throat irritation**, and **globus**; sinus involvement can cause headache and referred eye pain [^2ea9a89c] [^65d2b5d4].

---

## Neurologic and functional disorders

Migraine can present with **headache**, **eye pain**, and **sensory disturbances**; globus and throat discomfort may coexist [^1e87889a]. Functional globus sensation often coexists with **chronic cough** and **psychosocial factors** [^5727509d] [^db50710d].

---

## Serious conditions requiring urgent evaluation

| **Condition** | **Clinical features** | **Urgency** |
|-|-|-|
| Epiglottitis | Severe sore throat, dysphagia, drooling, muffled voice | Emergency |
| Retropharyngeal abscess | Severe throat pain, neck stiffness, fever, dysphagia | Emergency |
| Giant cell arteritis | Headache, visual symptoms, jaw claudication, sore throat | Urgent |
| Superior vena cava syndrome | Facial swelling, dyspnea, cough, sore throat | Urgent |

---

## Recommended diagnostic approach

- **History and physical examination**: Assess onset, duration, associated symptoms, travel, exposures, and comorbidities; examine the head and neck, including the oropharynx and neck nodes [^700707c7].
- **COVID-19 testing**: Perform when clinically indicated [^fad9e4f4].
- **Targeted labs**: CBC, EBV serology, strep testing, thyroid function if indicated [^2d54ac5a].
- **Imaging**: Consider sinus CT, chest X-ray, or MRI if red flags or persistent symptoms are present [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion

The most likely causes of this symptom cluster are **viral URI** (including COVID-19 and influenza), **LPR**, and **allergic rhinitis with sinus involvement**. Red flags should prompt urgent evaluation for serious pathology. A focused history, exam, and targeted testing guide diagnosis and management.

Introduction

Chronic throat symptoms, including cough, dysphonia, dysphagia, globus sensation and throat clearing, are frequently encountered in outpatient clinics.Differential diagnoses for these bothersome symptoms intersect multiple specialties, including otolaryngology, gastroenterology and respiratory medicine.However, identifying a definitive organic cause is often challenging for these symptoms, even with extensive evaluations.

Scenarios involving unexplained chronic throat symptoms (UCTS) present a dilemma for clinicians, as they contend with clinical ambiguity and unclear management directions. Their aetiology and pathophysiology though widely postulated continue to have unresolved clinical correlations. Current research frequently polarises rather than unites, with conclusions confounded by diverse clinical taxonomies and specialty concepts.Consequently, cohesive, evidence-driven guidelines for UCTS remain absent.

There is no common terminology adopted for clinical presentations involving UCTS,which hinders precise prevalence estimates. Notwithstanding, UCTS is estimated to constitute a significant burden in primary careand often necessitate additional specialist evaluations.While often overlooked in the absence of clinical red flags,these symptoms are associated with significant morbidity, indicating a potentially under-recognised public health issue.

In response to this area of need, we assembled a collaborative team of otolaryngology and gastroenterology specialists with the goal of providing a concise appraisal of aetiological and pathophysiological concepts in this field, including existing terminologies and their clinical implications. A key objective was to review the evidence and outcomes of existing single specialty-led approaches to UCTS diagnosis and management.

Next, based on the findings of our review, we aimed to provide readers with a practical evidence-based framework for the assessment and management of UCTS presentations.

Lemierre's syndrome is a rare yet potentially fatal cause of sore throat. Recently published literature suggests an increase in the incidence of this 'forgotten disease', highlighting Lemierre's syndrome as a clinically important differential diagnosis of sore throat. We present a case report of an 85-year-old man who developed a sore throat, which illustrates the re-emergence of Lemierre's syndrome. Reducing the morbidity and mortality from this disease requires a high index of clinical suspicion to ensure prompt diagnosis and initiation of appropriate multidisciplinary management.

### Managing a patient with globus pharyngeus [^d2f06706]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

A woman aged 47 years reported the feeling of a lump in her throat for the past year. The sensation was present intermittently and usually improved when she ate. She noted it was worse with dry swallows when she felt like a tablet was stuck in her throat. The sensation had become more persistent in recent weeks leading her to worry that she had cancer. She had no cough, sore throat or hoarseness. There were no precipitating factors and no symptoms of weight loss, dysphagia, odynophagia or change in her voice. She had smoked previously and rarely had heartburn. She had no other anxieties and was not under any unusual stress. She was initially assessed by an ear, nose and throat surgeon, who found no abnormalities on examination of her neck, throat and oral cavity. Nasolaryngoscopy was normal. An upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was organised and reported a hiatus hernia, but a 3-month trial of a proton pump inhibitor did not have any impact on her symptoms. The benign nature of her symptoms was discussed at her gastroenterology follow-up appointment. She was discharged back to primary care with a final diagnosis of 'globus'. A trial of speech therapy, cognitive behavioural therapy or amitriptyline would be recommended if her symptoms became more troublesome in future.

### Benign cough headache [^6dee9e2e]. Cephalalgia (2002). Low credibility.

Benign cough headache is an uncommon primary headache disorder marked by short-lasting attacks of pain triggered by coughing. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain is required to assure that the cough headache is truly benign. The aetiology of the pain is unclear, but is probably associated with the brief increased intracranial pressure that attends coughing. We have reviewed the clinical features, aetiology, differential diagnosis, management, and prognosis of benign cough headache.

### Dysphagia, hoarseness, and globus in a postoperative patient [^ed243cee]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2014). Low credibility.

Sore throat, hoarseness, and dysphagia are known and recognized postoperative complications of laryngeal mask airway use during operative procedures. The patient's symptoms, present immediately after surgery, are thought related to airway manipulation. Airway foreign bodies, although low on the differential, can cause similar symptoms. We present a case of a single patient who presented to a tertiary care center after an elective outpatient procedure with postoperative sore throat, hoarseness, and dysphagia. A foreign body was found lodged in the patient's hypopharynx. The differential diagnosis of sore throat, hoarseness, and dysphagia in the postoperative patient is explored in further detail.

### A sore throat – potentially life-threatening? [^82d8835f]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

A sore throat, which is most commonly viewed as a minor ailment, can be a manifestation of a life-threatening disorder known as Lemierre's syndrome caused by Fusobacterium necrophorum. We report a new case of Lemierre's syndrome that occurred in an otherwise healthy 18-year-old woman, who initially presented with fever and sore throat. The diagnosis was not made until a week later when blood cultures became available. This syndrome should be suspected until proven otherwise in any patient with signs of pharyngitis, a painful swollen neck, and pulmonary symptoms. By presenting this curable, but potentially life-threatening case of Lemierre's syndrome, we hope to increase the awareness of the early clinical manifestations of Lemierre's syndrome and to emphasize the importance of careful physical examination with special attention to the neck. Clinicians should be aware that exclusion of streptococcal infection in a patient with severe tonsillar infection does not exclude a bacterial cause.

### Globus hystericus: a brief review [^247cb69f]. General Hospital Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

Globus hystericus, a form of conversion disorder, is characterized by an uncomfortable sensation of a mass in the esophagus or airway. Evaluation proves no mass exists. Anxiety or psychological conflict is judged to be significantly related to the onset and progression of the sensation. The sensation may lead to difficulty swallowing or breathing and may become severe or life threatening. The disorder is poorly studied and understood. The differential diagnosis is vast. Management of the disorder is similar to that suggested for other conversion disorders. This article reviews the current literature about diagnosis, etiology, treatment, and prognosis of globus hystericus.

### Emergency evaluation and management of the sore throat [^700707c7]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Although sore throat is a very common complaint in the emergency department and is often associated with benign conditions, such as pharyngitis, it can be the early onset of something much more serious and even life threatening. A thorough history and examination are vital to the correct diagnosis but a high index of suspicion must be maintained to diagnose less common but serious pathology, such as epiglottitis and retropharyngeal abscess. Airway management is paramount to survival, and aggressive means should be taken early when epiglottitis is considered.

### Is your sore throat strep? [^e19c8bd7]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Error processing SSI file Strep Throat: All You Need to Know Worried your sore throat may be strep throat. Healthcare providers can do a quick test to see if a sore throat is strep throat. Antibiotics can help people with strep throat feel better faster and prevent spreading the bacteria to others. On This Page
- Bacteria cause strep throat
- How you get strep throat
- Symptoms often include pain and fever
- Some people are at increased risk
- A simple test gives fast results. Bacteria cause strep throat Viruses cause most sore throats. However, strep throat is an infection in the throat and tonsils caused by bacteria called group A Streptococcus. How you get strep throat Group A strep bacteria are very contagious. Generally, people spread the bacteria to others through
- Respiratory droplets
- Direct contact Rarely, group A strep bacteria can be spread through food that isn’t handled properly.

It usually takes 2 to 5 days after exposure to become ill with strep throat. Respiratory droplets Group A strep bacteria often live in the nose and throat. People who are infected spread the bacteria by talking, coughing, or sneezing. This creates respiratory droplets that contain the bacteria. People can get sick if they:
- Breathe in respiratory droplets that contain the bacteria
- Touch their mouth or nose after touching something with those droplets on it
- Use the same plate, utensil, or glass as a person infected with the bacteria. Direct contact People can also spread group A strep bacteria from infected sores on the skin. Other people can get sick if they touch those sores or come into contact with fluid from the sores. Some people infected with group A strep do not have symptoms or seem sick. People who are sick with strep throat are more contagious than those who do not have symptoms.

Symptoms often include pain and fever In general, strep throat is a mild disease, but it can be very painful. Common symptoms may include:
- Fever
- Pain when swallowing
- Sore throat that started very quickly and may look red
- Red and swollen tonsils
- White patches or streaks of pus on the tonsils
- Tiny, red spots on the roof of the mouth, called petechiae
- Swollen lymph nodes in the front of the neck. Less common symptoms may include vomiting and headache Some people, especially children, may have other symptoms, too. Other symptoms may include:
- Headache
- Stomach pain
- Nausea or vomiting
- Rash.

Symptoms do NOT include cough or runny nose The following symptoms suggest a virus is the cause of the illness instead of strep throat:
- Cough
- Runny nose
- Hoarseness
- Pink eye
- Up to 3 in 10 children with a sore throat have strep throat
- About 1 in 10 adults with a sore throat has strep throat. Some people are at increased risk Anyone can get strep throat, but there are some factors that can increase the risk of getting this common infection. Age Strep throat is more common in children than adults. It is most common in children 5 through 15 years old. It is very rare in children younger than 3 years old. Crowded settings can increase the risk of getting any group A strep infection including strep throat.

### Signs and symptoms to determine if a patient presenting in primary care or hospital outpatient settings has COVID-19 [^39ce24ff]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Symptoms and signs for which we performed pooling

We were able to conduct meta‐analyses for 14 signs or symptoms (cough, fever, anosmia, ageusia, anosmia or ageusia, sore throat, myalgia, fatigue, headache, dyspnoea, diarrhoea, sputum production, nausea or vomiting, chest tightness) based on clinically acceptable heterogeneity, the scatter of studies on visual inspection of the forest plots, and for which at least five studies were available. The analyses were restricted to cross‐sectional studies only. The ranges and summary estimates of the sensitivity and specificity of the 14 index tests are listed below. Additional summary point statistics are listed in additional Table 5.

### Should upper gastrointestinal endoscopy be part of the evaluation for supraesophageal symptoms of GERD? [^02b375f0]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2004). Low credibility.

The past decade has witnessed increasing interest in the supraesophageal (ear, nose, and throat (ENT)) symptoms potentially caused by gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Hoarseness, halitosis, problems with vocal presentations, excessive phlegm, frequent throat clearing, globus sensation, sore throat, cough, aspiration, laryngospasm, and laryngeal carcinoma are some, but not all of the ENT symptoms that have been attributed to GERD (1). The availability of highly effective medical and surgical therapies allows for control of these symptoms in many patients adding to the importance of accurately diagnosing GERD.

Transient visual loss (TVL) is a common complaint in the emergency department, with numerous possible etiologies. Prompt evaluation and management of TVL can potentially prevent progression to permanent visual loss. In this case, a 62-year-old woman presented with acute, painless, unilateral TVL. Two weeks before presentation, the patient reported bitemporal headaches and paresthesia of the distal extremities. A review of systems revealed chronic fatigue, cough, diffuse arthralgias, and decreased appetite for the previous 6 months. This case highlights the diagnostic approach to patients with TVL. Some common and rare causes associated with this clinical manifestation are briefly reviewed.

### Globus: current concepts and dilemmas [^21af3210]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Globus is an area of interest for many medical specialists including otorhinolaryngologists, gastroenterologist, allergists, and psychiatrists. It may be caused by an organic disease, but it is not uncommon that an underlying etiology remains unidentified even after a full workup has been performed. Patients who suffer from globus usually visit several physicians from different specialties without finding a solution for their symptoms. Identifying the underlying cause of globus is not always a simple task; therefore, structural or functional abnormalities of the thyroid, larynx, pharynx, and esophagus should be investigated. Gastroesophageal reflux disease is commonly considered to be the underlying cause after being identified in an otorhinolarygeal (ear, nose, and throat) evaluation, which is usually the first diagnostic step. In the last few years, an inlet patch in the proximal esophagus has been shown to be associated with globus, and its elimination has resulted in symptom resolution in some patients. Finally, globus can be associated with psychiatric disorders as well as oropharyngeal hypersensitivity that could be either chemical or mechanical. Treatment is directed toward an identified organic cause; in those with a functional disorder, the mainstay of therapy includes neuromodulators and psychiatric/psychological interventions.

### ESNM / ANMS review. diagnosis and management of globus sensation: a clinical challenge [^5727509d]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2020). Medium credibility.

Globus is a non-painful sensation of a tightness or a lump/foreign body in the throat that is not associated with dysphagia and may actually improve during meals. While several otorhinolaryngologic, thyroid, and esophageal disorders have been linked to globus, cause-and-effect relationships are difficult to establish. Consequently, though part of the evaluation, objective otorhinolaryngologic and esophageal testing is often negative. The presence of alarm symptoms, particularly pain, weight loss, dysphagia, or odynophagia is indications for objective testing. A diagnosis of idiopathic globus requires exclusion of pharyngeal, laryngeal, and esophageal disorders with laryngoscopy, endoscopy, high-resolution manometry, barium radiography, and/or ambulatory reflux monitoring. A trial of acid-suppressive therapy may be reasonable in the absence of alarm symptoms, especially if concurrent reflux symptoms are identified. Ablation of heterotopic gastric mucosa in the proximal esophagus has been reported to improve globus symptoms. Beyond these specific approaches, further management of idiopathic globus consists of reassurance, neuromodulators, and complementary approaches. Globus has a benign course with no long-term consequences, and the overall prognosis is good as the magnitude of symptoms may decline over time.

### Ear, nose and throat (ENT) manifestations and complications of reflux [^dac76213]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Laryngopharyngeal reflux disease describes the backflow of acidic stomach content towards the larynx and is associated with symptoms such as cough, throat clearing and globus. It is a common presentation in primary care and the sequelae of symptoms that arise from the disease often present in ear, nose and throat clinics. Assessment and examination of patients presenting with reflux symptoms includes questionnaires, as well as direct visualisation of the pharynx and larynx, and takes a multidisciplinary team approach. Treatment options include lifestyle modification, medical therapy and in some specialist centres, surgical management to address the multitude of symptoms associated with the disease.

### History of otolaryngology: globus pharyngeus as "Globus hystericus" [^0b5fcbb9]. Otolaryngology--Head and Neck Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Globus pharyngeus is the uncomfortable sensation of a "lump in the throat," and at present it has many recognized pathophysiologic causes. However, until relatively recently, this condition was often labeled "globus hystericus" and was thought to be a manifestation of hysteria or anxiety. In this commentary, we briefly review the history surrounding the initial treatment of globus pharyngeus sensation as a hysterical condition rooted in anxiety/psychological causes; then, we briefly review the emerging evidence that roots globus pharyngeus sensation within a constellation of pathophysiologies that are related to pharyngoesophageal inflammation and irritation rather than psychological disorders.

### Sore throat [^1e803f54]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2014). Medium credibility.

Introduction

About 10% of people present to primary healthcare services with sore throat each year. The causative organisms of sore throat may be bacteria (most commonly Streptococcus) or viruses (typically rhinovirus), although it is difficult to distinguish bacterial from viral infections clinically.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of interventions to reduce symptoms of acute infective sore throat? We searched Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to September 2013 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 6 studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review, we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: antibiotics, corticosteroids, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and paracetamol.

Differential diagnosis of globus sensation in an otherwise asymptomatic patient should include hypopharyngeal fibrovascular polyp to avoid potentially fatal complications like airway compromise following regurgitation. We present a case of a 74-year-old man with a 13-cm long hypopharyngeal fibrovascular polyp with 9 months history of globus sensation. A narrow stalk of the giant polyp allowed endoscopic removal and complete resection with the CO 2 laser. Histopathological examination was conclusive for the fibrovascular polyp.

### Pharyngitis (...) [^d8e95bdc]. AAFP (2004). Low credibility.

Differential Diagnosis Sore throat most often is caused by direct infection of the pharynx, primarily by viruses or bacteria. 4 GABHS pharyngitis accounts for 15 to 30 percent of cases in children and 5 to 15 percent of cases in adults. 5, 6, 9, 10 Sore throat also may be caused by other conditions, such as gastroesophageal reflux, postnasal drip secondary to rhinitis, persistent cough, thyroiditis, allergies, a foreign body, and smoking. 1, 2, 11. This article focuses on infectious causes of sore throat. If patients do not have any other signs of infection or do not respond as expected to treatment of pharyngitis, physicians should investigate noninfectious causes. VIRUSES Viral pharyngitis, the most common cause of sore throat, has a wide differential. Furthermore, different viruses are more prevalent during certain seasons. 4 Coryza, conjunctivitis, malaise or fatigue, hoarseness, and low-grade fever suggest the presence of viral pharyngitis.

12 Children with viral pharyngitis also can present with atypical symptoms, such as mouth-breathing, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. 8, 12. INFECTIOUS MONONUCLEOSIS Infectious mononucleosis is most common in patients 15 to 30 years of age. 13 Patients typically present with fever, sore throat, and malaise. On examination, there is pharyngeal injection with exudates. Posterior cervical lymphadenopathy is common in patients with infectious mononucleosis, and its absence makes the diagnosis much less likely. Hepatosplenomegaly also may be present. 10–12 If these patients are treated with amoxicillin or ampicillin, 90 percent will develop a classic maculopapular rash. 14, 15. GABHS Infection Symptoms of strep throat may include pharyngeal erythema and swelling, tonsillar exudate, edematous uvula, palatine petechiae, and anterior cervical lymphadenopathy. Untreated, GABHS infection lasts seven to 10 days.

4, 13, 19 Patients with untreated streptococcal pharyngitis are infectious during the acute phase of the illness and for one additional week. 1 Effective antibiotic therapy shortens the infectious period to 24 hours, reduces the duration of symptoms by about one day, and prevents most complications. Scarlet fever is associated with GABHS pharyngitis and usually presents as a punctate, erythematous, blanchable, sandpaper-like exanthem. The rash is found in the neck, groin, and axillae, and is accentuated in body folds and creases. 1, 4, 19 The pharynx and tonsils are erythematous and covered with exudates. The tongue may be bright red with a white coating.
4. Diphtheria is an acute upper respiratory tract illness that is characterized by sore throat, low-grade fever, and an adherent grayish membrane with surrounding inflammation of the tonsils, pharynx, or nasal passages. 16, 22 In diphtheria, the throat is moderately sore, with tender cervical adenopathy.

Case fatality rates for noncutaneous diphtheria have remained constant for the past five decades. 23 Diphtheria pharyngitis has recently been reported in Delaware County, Pa.
24. KAWASAKI DISEASE Kawasaki disease is probably an infectious disease caused by an unknown agent. The disease most often affects children younger than five years and presents with a constellation of symptoms, including sore throat. Characteristic signs and symptoms include fever, bilateral nonpurulent conjunctivitis, anterior cervical node enlargement, erythematous oral mucosa, and an inflamed pharynx with a strawberry tongue. Dermatologic features of the disease become apparent within three days of the onset of fever. 14, 18 and include cracked red lips, a generalized polymorphous erythematous rash with edema and erythema of the hands and feet, and periungual desquamation followed by peeling of the palms.

### Practical multidisciplinary framework for the assessment and management of patients with unexplained chronic aerodigestive symptoms [^dfa8e29f]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Establishing a positive diagnosis: suggested criteria for ‘irritable throat syndrome’

The pursuit of a positive diagnostic paradigm has standardised the approach to DGBI and permitted clinicians to proactively pursue a diagnosis based on defined symptom clusters, after excluding mimics. Based on our findings, we propose that a similar evidence-based model might be adopted for a positive diagnosis in patients with irritable throat-like symptoms following evaluation of chronic throat symptoms to rule out discernible structural causes and mimics (box 1). This positive diagnosis framework offers a structured approach, eliminating the need for repetitive and usually unremarkable tests. Further, it supports the adoption of a common medical language to validate patient symptoms, standardise interdisciplinary approaches, strengthen patient–clinician rapport, promote prompt delivery of therapy and encourages judicious use of resources.

Box 1 
Proposed diagnostic criteria for irritable throat syndrome

Presence of one or more of the following unexplained chronic throat symptoms; cough, dysphonia, globus

sensation, oropharyngeal dysphagia, repetitive throat clearing, catarrh/sensation of mucus in the throat, abnormal throat sensations, for at least 1 day each week, over the last 12 weeks, with:

No explanation from comorbid diagnoses.
No explanation from routine physical examinations and investigations.
Exclusion of structural or other organic pathology of the aerodigestive tract via nasoendoscopy.

Additional criteria

Patients with PPI refractory reflux symptoms: Throat (extra-oesophageal) symptoms persist despite standard GORD therapies. In patients with PPI-resistant reflux/dyspeptic symptoms (in addition to throat symptoms), gastroenterology evaluation excludes structural gastrointestinal abnormalities and objective evidence of pathological gastro-oesophageal reflux.

Patients with globus sensation: Exclusion of a structural lesion identified on physical examination, laryngoscopy or endoscopy, absence of a gastric inlet patch in the proximal oesophagus, exclusion of a major oesophageal motor disorder and exclusion of eosinophilic oesophagitis. If overlapping PPI refractory oesophageal reflux symptoms consider oesophageal pH studies to exclude pathological gastro-oesophageal reflux.
Patients with overlapping oesophageal dysphagia: Gastroenterology evaluation excludes structural oesophageal causes, eosinophilic oesophagitis and major oesophageal motor disorders.
Patients with lower airway disease: A respiratory physician confirms that refractory throat symptoms cannot be adequately explained by comorbid lower airway pathology.
Patients with chronic cough: A respiratory physician excludes organic lower airway causes of cough.

### A 59-year-old man with a rash and hearing loss [^f3c683f9]. NEJM Evidence (2024). Medium credibility.

AbstractMorning Report is a time-honored tradition where physicians-in-training present cases to their colleagues and clinical experts to collaboratively examine an interesting patient presentation. The Morning Report section seeks to carry on this tradition by presenting a patient's chief concern and story, inviting the reader to develop a differential diagnosis and discover the diagnosis alongside the authors of the case. This report examines the story of a 59-year-old man who initially had a sore throat, a truncal rash, and fever. Two weeks later, arthralgias and abrupt bilateral hearing loss developed. Using questions, physical examination, and testing, an illness script for the presentation emerges. As the clinical course progresses, the differential is refined until a diagnosis is made.

The common cold and influenza (flu) are the most common syndromes of infection in human beings. These diseases are diagnosed on symptomatology, and treatments are mainly symptomatic, yet our understanding of the mechanisms that generate the familiar symptoms is poor compared with the amount of knowledge available on the molecular biology of the viruses involved. New knowledge of the effects of cytokines in human beings now helps to explain some of the symptoms of colds and flu that were previously in the realm of folklore rather than medicine-eg, fever, anorexia, malaise, chilliness, headache, and muscle aches and pains. The mechanisms of symptoms of sore throat, rhinorrhoea, sneezing, nasal congestion, cough, watery eyes, and sinus pain are discussed, since these mechanisms are not dealt with in any detail in standard medical textbooks.

### Practical multidisciplinary framework for the assessment and management of patients with unexplained chronic aerodigestive symptoms [^81caff7d]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Functional throat disorders (FTD)

Throat symptoms appear to, in some cases, reflect patterns of abnormal aerodigestive sensation, motility and/or reflex function.These physiological disruptions to usual function are proposed to account for varied symptom presentations in patients without structural disease.

Sensory disruptions

Hypersensitisation of aerodigestive structures is a common theme among symptom theories related to UCTS.Cough hypersensitivity syndrome (CHS) and laryngeal hypersensitivity and diagnoses which typify this pathophysiological pattern, reinforced by emerging research.The core understanding implicates sensory dysregulation of aerodigestive tract or related reflexes in symptom emergence, most notably cough and globus sensation.Postulated mechanisms encompass epithelial sensory receptor adaptations in response to chronic inflammation or other stimuli,somatosensory adaptations involving the vagus nerve or higher centres involved in neuromotor regulation of the aerodigestive tract.

Motor disruptions

Beyond sensory dysfunction, dysregulated motor patterns impacting the laryngeal or supraglottic musculature are detected during laryngoscopic evaluations in patients with UCTS.Two predominant phenotypes emerge: vocal cord dysfunction syndromes that, barring inducible laryngeal obstructions, do not compromise respiratory function; and muscle tension syndromes, particularly concerning the supraglottic musculature. Manifestations include a spectrum of chronic throat symptoms, with dysphonia, globus, throat clearing and cough often highlighted.Oropharyngeal dysphagia and globus sensation are likewise proposed to show association with motor tone or coordination dysfunctions affecting the upper oesophageal sphincter or proximal oesophagus.

Headaches are a global health problem and are encountered by a variety of specialties, including otolaryngologists. These patients can present as a challenge, but an understanding of primary and secondary headache disorders and the accompanying broad differential diagnosis is critical. For secondary headache disorders, a differential diagnosis categorized by anatomic location can help organize the evaluation of these patients, which can then be narrowed by the history and examination findings. Additional ancillary tests such as laboratories and imaging can further aid in diagnosis but are not always necessary.

### Notes from the field: group A streptococcal pharyngitis misdiagnoses at a rural urgent-care clinic – Wyoming, March 2015 [^315daa72]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2016). Low credibility.

Group A Streptococcus (GAS) is the most common bacterial cause of pharyngitis, implicated in 20%-30% of pediatric and 5%-15% of adult health care visits for sore throat (1). Along with the sudden onset of throat pain, GAS pharyngitis symptoms include fever, headache, and bilateral tender cervical lymphadenopathy (1,2). Accurate diagnosis and management of GAS pharyngitis is critical for limiting antibiotic overuse and preventing rheumatic fever (2), but distinguishing between GAS and viral pharyngitis clinically is challenging (1). Guidelines for diagnosis and management of GAS pharyngitis have been published by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA)* (1). IDSA recommends that patients with sore throat be tested for GAS to distinguish between GAS and viral pharyngitis; however, IDSA emphasizes the use of selective testing based on clinical symptoms and signs to avoid identifying GAS carriers rather than acute GAS infections (1). Therefore, testing for GAS usually is not recommended for the following: patients with sore throat and accompanying symptoms (e.g., cough, rhinorrhea) that strongly suggest a viral etiology; children aged <3 years, because acute rheumatic fever is extremely rare in this age group; and asymptomatic household contacts of patients with GAS pharyngitis (1). IDSA recommends penicillin or amoxicillin as the treatment of choice based on effectiveness and narrow spectrum of activity. To date, penicillin-resistant GAS has never been documented (1).

### Updates to the modern diagnosis of GERD: Lyon consensus 2.0 [^7f079c3a]. Gut (2024). Medium credibility.

Chronic cough and wheezing have a significantly lower likelihood of direct reflux aetiology compared with typical symptoms (figure 1). Chronic cough may represent hyper-responsive behaviour, where reflux is one of several triggers for coughing bouts, such as abrupt changes in temperature or humidity, prolonged talking or voice use, strong odours or scents, food triggers and postnasal drip.Refluxate aspirated into the airways has been implicated in graft failure after lung transplant, and in the pathogenesis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.Wheezing and asthma may rarely be triggered by reflux, when aggressive reflux management may provide better control of asthma.

Data demonstrating response of globus to GERD management are scarce.Hoarseness, throat clearing and sore throat have even less robust reflux associations,and these symptoms often correlate with cognitive processes with or without reflux disease.While dysphagia can be a consequence of reflux-induced oesophageal strictures or advanced erosive oesophagitis, primary dysphagia without heartburn, especially with bolus impaction, may suggest eosinophilic oesophagitis or a motility disorder. Finally, epigastric and abdominal symptoms (nausea, abdominal pain) are unlikely to have a reflux aetiology (figure 1) where reflux monitoring is typically not recommended, the exception being mischaracterisation of heartburn as epigastric burning.

This patient was diagnosed with mild COVID-19 illness, sore throat and loss of sense of smell as well as positive COVID-19 PCR, 0n 26 October 2020. Following full recovery by resolution of symptoms and reverting to negative PCR, he received the first dose of inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine on November 6. Following the first dose of vaccine, he remained asymptomatic and well. He received the second dose on 6 December 2020. A few hours later the patient started to experience headache and fatigue. The day after, he started to develop fever, sore throat and abdominal pain. The illness progressed over the following 4 days when he presented to the emergency department with high-grade fever, myalgia, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea, and a faint erythematous non-itchy rash over his torso that he noticed earlier that day. The patient reported a dry irritant cough but no shortness of breath or chest discomfort. He had no urinary symptoms and no pain or swelling of his joints.

The patient had no history of recent travel, no sick contacts, no animal exposure and no consumption of raw dairy products. He was not on any chronic medications and had no known allergies. He reported taking ibuprofen and one dose of an antibiotic over the prior few days for symptomatic relief. He was a non-smoker and did not use recreational drugs.

In the emergency department the patient was noted to have a temperature of 39°C, systolic blood pressure of 110 mm Hg and tachycardia, 140 beats per minute. Physical examination revealed dry mucous membranes with congested throat. Bilateral conjunctival injection and left conjunctival haemorrhage. There was a generalised erythematous maculopapular rash, mostly over the chest and back. His peripheral lymph nodes were not enlarged. There were no audible cardiac murmurs, his chest was clear to auscultation, abdomen examination was unremarkable.

### Sore throat in a young man: guess what … [^15b1cb67]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

Sore throat is a common complaint in the outpatient and emergency room settings. Typically, little workup is necessary and includes visual inspection with or without swabs for bacterial infection. We present a case that demonstrates an important entity to be excluded by simple history and physical examination in patients presenting with pain in the throat or neck. The most important cause of pneumomediastinum is previous instrumentation. Spontaneous pneumomediastinum is uncommonly seen in young adults. Most cases of spontaneous pneumomediastinum are uncomplicated, as mediastinal pressures rarely mount to dangerous levels. However, when the patient presents with distended neck veins, cyanosis or marked dyspnoea, further action is necessary. Lastly, since pneumomediastinum can be caused by oesophageal rupture and occasionally present with concurrent pneumothorax, these dangerous entities must be excluded.

### 'Persistent throat symptoms' versus' laryngopharyngeal reflux': a cross-sectional study refining the clinical condition [^eb7773f7]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Patients are commonly referred to secondary care for assessment of a variety of laryngeal and pharyngeal symptoms. These include: dysphonia, ‘globus’ sensation, throat clearing, excessive mucus, postnasal secretions, cough and throat discomfort. A conservative estimate of 60 000 such patients are seen annually by specialists in England.The diagnosis of ‘laryngopharyngeal reflux’ remains a popular moniker for these symptoms, accompanying the vogue for gastric acid-suppression treatment.A recent large UK multicentre randomised controlled trial (Trial Of Proton-Pump Inhibitors in Throat Symptoms; TOPPITS) in 346 patients with chronic pharyngeal and laryngeal symptoms found that Lansoprazole 30 mg two times per day conferred no benefit over placebo.These findings should lead specialists to re-explore other potential causes of chronic throat symptoms that have received little press in the face of the reflux aetiology theory. The link between chronic throat symptoms and psychological distress is well documented.Raised body mass index (BMI), life events, snoring, upper airway dryness and hormonal changes have all been associated with chronic throat and voice symptoms.

The individual symptoms that patients present with, such as catarrh, throat clearing, intermittent hoarseness or globus frequently coexist. The repeated need to clear the throat is the most common symptom in most cohorts. Throat clearing may culminate in voice change and is often associated with globus sensation, but equally may occur with the sensation of mucus coming into the throat from the nose. Predating the popularisation of the global term ‘laryngopharyngeal reflux’, individual symptoms such as globus, catarrh and functional dysphonia were approached discretely, both from clinical and research perspectives.

This study aimed to explore the rich baseline psychometric dataset from recruits to the TOPPITS trial, for any identifiable symptom clusters, which might provide, in the longer term, a more rational basis for treatment.

Headache

Sensitivity analysis (prospective data collection only): sensitivity ranged from 3% to 85%; specificity from 18% to 98%
Pooled sensitivity 21.9% (95% CI 9.2% to 43.5%); pooled specificity 80.1% (95% CI 60.2% to 91.4%); 6 studies, 6171 participants

Cough and fever (see sensitivity analyses) were the only index tests with a pooled sensitivity above 50% but their pooled specificity was only 35.5% and 67.4% respectively (Figure 20 ; Figure 15). Pooled specificity was above 90% for diarrhoea, nausea or vomiting, chest tightness, anosmia, ageusia, and for the presence of anosmia or ageusia (Figure 16 ; Figure 19). However, their pooled sensitivity was very low (maximum 11.6% for diarrhoea), except for anosmia (28.0%) and anosmia or ageusia (41.0%).

The only tests exceeding a pooled diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) of 5 were anosmia as a single test or in combination with ageusia (anosmia or ageusia). Yet, their pooled positive likelihood ratio (LR+) was below our predefined cut‐off of 5 for a useful red flag (4.25 (95% CI 3.17 to 5.71) and 4.31 (95% CI 3.00 to 6.18), respectively). The pooled negative likelihood ratios (LRs‐) were too high to make any of the reported tests useful to rule out the presence of COVID‐19 disease. In other words, the absence of the above mentioned index tests does not necessarily imply the absence of COVID‐19 disease.

Symptoms and signs for which we did not perform pooling

Rhinorrhoea (5 studies, 2252 participants): sensitivity between 4% to 62%, specificity between 37% to 93%
Chills (6 studies, 4151 participants): sensitivity between 4% to 80%, specificity between 36% to 93%
Myalgia or arthralgia (5 studies, 556 participants): sensitivity between 19% to 86%, specificity between 35% to 91%
Anosmia or dysgeusia (2 studies, 457 participants): sensitivity between 9% to 74%, specificity between 78% to 97%

### Clinical practice guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America: 2018 update on diagnosis, treatment, chemoprophylaxis, and institutional outbreak management of seasonal influenzaa [^a67f3a43]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

IDSA 2018 seasonal influenza—hospitalized adults and pediatric predictors show variable accuracy and age-specific features. In hospitalized patients, fever with cough or sore throat had a sensitivity of 43% for patients without asthma and only 20% for asthmatic patients. Infants and young children with influenza may not always have fever and may present with a wide range of signs and symptoms, may present with fever and suspected sepsis, and diarrhea can occur in up to 28% of infants and young children with influenza. In young children 1–5 years, fever >38°C, chills, headache, malaise, and sore eyes were significantly associated with a positive RT-PCR test result. In pediatric patients, fever (≥38°C), headache, cough, and absence of abnormal breathing sounds had a positive predictive value of 57.1%. Among children aged ≤5 years, adding rhinorrhea to the fever and cough case definition achieved a better balance between sensitivity (83%) and specificity (47%), and among pediatric outpatients aged ≤13 years with respiratory infections, fever was the only reliable predictor of culture-confirmed influenza virus infection.

### Clinical reasoning: progressive headache and diplopia in an 89-year-old man [^5eed58fb]. Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

An 89-year-old man presented with a 3-year history of chronic daily headaches that significantly worsened over the past 4 months. Initially episodic, the left-sided headaches became continuous and were accompanied by systemic symptoms such as weight loss and elevated inflammatory markers, specifically C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Over subsequent weeks, the neurologic examination revealed new-onset left-sided ophthalmoplegia, ptosis, and marked visual acuity loss. This article explores the differential diagnosis for such a complex clinical presentation and highlights how a systematic diagnostic approach can guide clinicians toward the correct diagnosis.

### Giant cell arteritis characterised by sore throat [^b5263d0f]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Giant cell arteritis is a devastating condition that can lead to permanent vision loss. Early diagnosis is vital to initiate corticosteroid treatment before irreversible visual symptoms develop. This case study examines an 81-year-old woman with a history of polymyalgia rheumatica who initially presented with sore throat and headache. She was ultimately diagnosed with giant cell arteritis. However, her diagnosis was delayed by multiple emergency and outpatient providers who failed to evaluate her for giant cell arteritis. Her story reflects the importance of assessing polymyalgia rheumatica patients for giant cell arteritis even when presenting with more unusual symptoms, such as sore throat.

Overall, diagnostic accuracy of individual signs and symptoms is low, especially sensitivity. In addition, results were highly variable across studies, making it difficult to draw firm conclusions.

Signs and symptoms for which sensitivity was reported above 50% in at least one cross‐sectional study are the following.

Cough: sensitivity between 43% and 71%, specificity between 14% and 54%
Sore throat: sensitivity between 5% and 71%, specificity between 55% and 80%
Fever: sensitivity between 7% and 91%, specificity between 16% and 94%
Myalgia or arthralgia: sensitivity between 19% and 86%, specificity between 45% and 91%
Fatigue: sensitivity between 10% and 57%, specificity between 60% and 94%
Headache: sensitivity between 3% and 71%, specificity between 78% and 98%

For fever, six of nine studies report a sensitivity of at least 80%, which is unsurprising considering fever was a key feature of COVID‐19 that was used in selecting patients for further testing. As a result, most participants in these studies would have fever, both cases and non‐cases. The same applies to cough, which was also listed as one of the main criteria for SARS‐CoV‐2 testing and may have contributed to inflated sensitivity estimates.

### Otolaryngologic manifestations among MPOX patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^da771daa]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

MPOX has numerous otolaryngologic presentations that have been recognized as clinically important, especially with the onset of the 2022 outbreak. However, how these features vary across region and outbreak have yet to be elucidated or supported by meta-analysis. The objective of this study is to identify the otolaryngologic manifestations of MPOX across previous and current outbreaks and among endemic and non-endemic regions.

Basic Procedures

Data sources of MEDLINE (PubMed), the Cochrane Library, Scopus, Embase, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and OpenGrey were searched through August 2022. All observational studies reporting data on laboratory-confirmed MPOX patients with otolaryngologic symptoms were included. Two authors independently performed the screening process while a third resolved disagreements. Data were extracted into a structured form by two authors independently. We performed a meta-analysis of the prevalence of otorhinolaryngologic symptoms using MetaXL software (version 5.3) under a random-effects model.

Main Findings

38 studies with 5952 patients were included. The four most prevalent manifestations were headache at 31 % (95 % CI [0.16-0.49], I 2 = 99 %), sore throat at 22 % (95 % CI [0.09-0.37], I 2 = 99 %), cough at 16 % (95 % CI [0.05-0.30], I 2 = 99 %), and cervical lymphadenopathy at 10 % (95 % CI [0.01-0.26], I 2 = 100 %). Otolaryngologic features were more prevalent in previous outbreaks as compared to the 2022 outbreak including 37 % prevalence of headache (95 % CI [0.11-0.66], I 2 = 100 %), 33 % prevalence of cough (95 % CI [0.21-0.47], I 2 = 98 %), 27 % prevalence of sore throat (95 % CI [0.07-0.53], I 2 = 99 %), 15 % prevalence of cervical lymphadenopathy (95 % CI [0.00-0.428], I 2 = 100 %), 13 % prevalence of oral ulcers (95 % CI [0.02-0.30], I 2 = 99 %), 6 % prevalence of oral exanthem (95 % CI [0.00-0.17], I 2 = 99 %), 5 % prevalence of dysphagia (95 % CI [0.00-0.18], I 2 = 99 %), and 5 % prevalence of tonsillar signs (95 % CI [0.00-0.13], I 2 = 99 %). Features that were more prevalent in endemic areas versus non-endemic areas include 27 % prevalence of cough (95 % CI [0.14-0.41], I 2 = 99 %), 15 % prevalence of oral ulcers (95 % CI [0.02-0.36], I 2 = 99 %), 6 % prevalence of tonsillar signs (95 % CI [0.00-0.18], I 2 = 99 %), and 19 % prevalence of cervical lymphadenopathy (95 % CI [0.00-0.48], I 2 = 100 %), while the only feature more prevalent in non-endemic areas was headache with a prevalence of 36 % (95 % CI [0.24-0.47], I 2 = 96 %).

Principal Conclusions

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, four symptoms - headache, sore throat, cough, and cervical lymphadenopathy - were found to be the most prevalent otolaryngologic features of MPOX. Otolaryngologic manifestations of MPOX were more pronounced in prior outbreaks and in endemic areas as compared to the 2022 outbreak and non-endemic areas. These findings may aid MPOX recognition in an otolaryngology setting.

Each can occur in primary and secondary form. Thunderclap headache is the most frequently reported headache syndrome associated with a secondary pathology. Discussed are the complexities of whether all patients with thunderclap headache should have further investigation if timely computerised tomography is normal and, the relevance of abnormal imaging in these disorders, differentiating what is deemed to be secondary and managing the pain.

### Sinus headache: differential diagnosis and an evidence-based approach [^77b96192]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

The diagnosis "sinus headache" has been reclassified as "headache attributed to disorder of the nose or paranasal sinuses" by the International Headache Society, but the term is still commonly used by patients and primary care doctors alike. Rhinologic symptoms and headache disorders are common, and they may coexist without a causative relationship. Patients may undergo unnecessary medical interventions because of inadequate understanding of the classifications and management of various headache disorders. Otolaryngologists frequently treat patients with these complaints, and a systematic approach to the differential diagnosis and utilization of a multidisciplinary approach are critical in providing optimal patient care.

Sore throat is one of the most common reasons for visits to family physicians. While most patients with sore throat have an infectious cause (pharyngitis), fewer than 20 percent have a clear indication for antibiotic therapy (i.e., group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal infection). Useful, well-validated clinical decision rules are available to help family physicians care for patients who present with pharyngitis. Because of recent improvements in rapid streptococcal antigen tests, throat culture can be reserved for patients whose symptoms do not improve over time or who do not respond to antibiotics.

Rationale for best practice statements—history taking for gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms in COVID-19. In outpatients with new-onset diarrhea, ascertain information about high-risk contact exposure; obtain a detailed history of symptoms associated with COVID-19, including fever, cough, shortness of breath, chills, muscle pain, headache, sore throat, or new loss of taste or smell; and obtain a thorough history for other GI symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. In outpatients with new-onset GI symptoms (eg, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea), monitor for symptoms associated with COVID-19, as GI symptoms may precede COVID-related symptoms by a few days, and in a high COVID-19 prevalence setting, COVID-19 testing should be considered. In hospitalized patients with suspected or known COVID-19, obtain a thorough history of GI symptoms (ie, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea), including onset, characteristics, duration, and severity.

### When is It not "Just a sore throat? " (...) [^2dd5bfb4]. AAFP (2011). Low credibility.

Sore throat consistently ranks in the top 10 reasons for ambulatory care visits. We see this symptom so often that our vocabulary even includes the phrase “just a sore throat. ” For more than 50 years, physicians have considered group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus the only important cause of sore throat, because it can lead to acute rheumatic fever. Although we know that other organisms can also cause sore throat, disease management guidelines ignore them because experts believe those organisms cause self-limited symptoms without serious sequelae. 1, 2 These guidelines have driven many physicians to use algorithms for sore throat management, which has resulted in many offices, urgent care centers, and emergency departments using programmed evaluation and management strategies for patients with sore throat. Often, the rapid strep test is ordered routinely for patients with sore throat, rather than basing the decision to test on a targeted history and physical examination.

This strategy results in patients being diagnosed as having or not having strep throat, which implies that antibiotics are not needed if the patient does not have strep throat. We encourage physicians, residents, and students to learn the differential diagnosis of worsening pharyngitis, including non-group A streptococcus, untreated group A streptococcus, infectious mononucleosis, acute human immunodeficiency virus infection, peritonsillar abscess, and Lemierre syndrome. 3, 4 We recommend remembering the natural history of “just a sore throat, ” which is resolution of symptoms in three to five days. When the patient's symptoms persist or worsen, the diagnosis no longer fits this category, and a more careful diagnostic and therapeutic approach is required.

Fusobacterium necrophorum, a newly recognized bacterial cause of pharyngitis, can result in a potentially devastating suppurative complication called Lemierre syndrome, which usually begins with a sore throat that improves over the first four to five days. 5 The patient then has a recurrence of symptoms, with the addition of bacteremic symptoms including rigors, fever, and night sweats. Patients also develop suppurative internal jugular thrombophlebitis and metastatic infections, especially in the lungs, joints, or brain. Patients with Lemierre syndrome have an estimated mortality of 5 percent, with significant short- and long-term morbidity. 6 Lemierre syndrome occurs most often in adolescents and young adults, and. Fusobacterium pharyngitis occurs predominantly in the same age group. 6 A Lemierre syndrome variant can also occur before adolescence; however, it rarely starts with a sore throat.

No laboratory method for diagnosing Fusobacterium pharyngitis is readily available. F. necrophorum is a gram-negative anaerobic bacterium that is difficult to grow on routine media from throat swabs. Blood cultures grow the organism, but identification is slow. Many Lemierre syndrome diagnoses occur after the blood cultures become positive and after complications have occurred. Fusobacterium pharyngitis cannot be routinely diagnosed, so we cannot recommend antibiotic treatment for preventing Lemierre syndrome. We believe that following the American College of Physicians/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines endorsed by the American Academy of Family Physicians would decrease the risk of Lemierre syndrome in adolescents and young adults.

### Confirmation bias in medical referrals: an unusual presentation of pain at the base of the skull [^ee677858]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

A middle-aged woman was referred to the admitting medical team with sudden onset pain at the base of the skull. Initial differentials included subarachnoid haemorrhage and meningitis. Due to the referral of a patient presenting with occipital headache, there was a confirmation bias by the medical team in the initial assessment of this patient, and alternative diagnoses were not considered in the first instance. On review by a medical consultant, pathology in the upper neck was proposed as a cause for the pain. Dedicated CT imaging of the neck revealed acute calcification of the longus colli muscle. This is a usually benign self-limiting condition which is managed in the first instance with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Acute calcification of the longus colli is a rare and poorly recognised condition. It should be considered as a potential differential for patients presenting with neck pain, particularly in the presence of odynophagia and mildly elevated inflammatory markers. Cognitive bias should be considered during initial assessment of patients to help reduce premature closure when forming differential diagnoses.

### Clinical practice guideline (update): adult sinusitis [^2ea9a89c]. Otolaryngology--Head and Neck Surgery (2015). Medium credibility.

Allergic rhinitis (AR)—history and physical examination for initial clinical diagnosis emphasizes that Key elements of the history in patients presenting with AR include seasonal, perennial or episodic, exposure-associated itching of the nose, palate, or eyes, sneezing, nasal congestion, sniffing, clear rhinorrhea, and postnasal drip. Children may only complain of malaise or fatigue, often associated with a cough, and the history must include specific questions about rhinorrhea and nasal and ocular itch in order to elicit these complaints. Symptoms of other sinonasal diseases such as sinusitis, vasomotor rhinitis, and granulomatous diseases can overlap with AR symptoms and should be differentiated from AR, and Less typical symptoms such as epistaxis, unilateral rhinorrhea, unilateral nasal blockage, severe headache, or anosmia suggest alternative diagnoses and should be investigated further. Viral upper respiratory infections may produce similar symptoms but tend to be of a shorter duration and often include other symptoms such as fever and myalgia. A family history of AR, asthma, or atopic dermatitis strengthens the diagnosis of AR in patients with compatible symptoms. Findings on physical examination that support the diagnosis of AR include several classic findings, such as clear rhinorrhea and pale pink or bluish swelling of the nasal turbinate mucosa, and Frequent throat clearing is often present as well, reflecting postnasal drip. Although definitive diagnosis depends on the finding of an IgE-mediated response to a specific allergen, detected through cutaneous or blood testing in most patients, it is reasonable to make an initial diagnosis and begin therapy based on the history and physical examination, and A good response to avoidance of suspected allergens or appropriate empiric therapy supports the diagnosis of AR and may preclude the need for further testing.

Of the many different complaints of patients presenting to the emergency department, some of the most difficult to diagnose and manage involve pathology of the head and neck. Often diagnoses of conditions affecting this part of the body are elusive, and occasionally, even once the diagnosis has been made, the management of these disorders remains challenging. This article addresses some of the high-risk chief complaints of the head and neck regarding diagnosis and management. These complaints include headache, seizure, acute focal neurologic deficits, throat and neck pain, ocular emergencies, and the difficult airway.

A careful history and physical is necessary to establish a differential diagnosis and to guide the choice of testing to make an accurate diagnosis. The most common types of headaches are discussed in this review. They are divided into primary and secondary headache disorders as classified by the International Headache Society. Primary headache disorders include migraine without and with aura, cluster and tension-type headaches. Secondary headaches are those that occur as a result of some other disorder and include brain tumors, rhinosinusitis, diseases of intracranial and extracranial vasculature, and temporomandibular joint disease.

The parapharyngeal space is a rare location for head and neck liposarcoma, and these lesions may therefore be confused with a variety of other tumors that can originate in this area. Here, we report a case of liposarcoma originating from the prestyloid parapharyngeal space and discuss the possible differential diagnosis on radiographic findings.

### Pharyngitis management: defining the controversy [^7b50994c]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Despite numerous controlled trials, clinical practice guidelines and cost-effective analyses, controversy persists regarding the appropriate management strategy for adult pharyngitis. In this perspective, we explore this controversy by comparing two competing clinical guidelines. Although the guidelines appear to make widely diverging recommendations, we show that the controversy centers on only a small proportion of patients: those presenting with severe pharyngitis. We examine recently published data to illustrate that this seemingly simple problem of strep throat remains a philosophical issue: should we give primacy to relieving acute time-limited symptoms, or should we emphasize the potential societal risk of antibiotic resistance? We accept potentially over treating a minority of adult pharyngitis patients with the most severe presentations to reduce suffering in an approximately equal number of patients who will have false negative test results if the test-and-treat strategy were used.

### Pain symptoms in patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19): a literature review [^6a921fb6]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

On 11 March, 2020, the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak was declared as a global pandemic by the World Health Organization. It brought substantial physical and psychological burden on individuals and financial loss across countries. Patients with COVID-19 may exhibit various symptoms, such as fever, cough, dyspnea, muscle pain, sore throat, headache, chest pain, and abdominal pain, at 2-14 days after exposure to the novel coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS]-CoV-2). Pain symptoms present important challenge to clinicians' diagnosis when treating COVID-19 patients with mild symptoms. Considering the increasing number of confirmed COVID-19 cases, the pain symptoms should be systematically summarized.

Results

The virus can invade different tissues of the body and cause different pain manifestations. SARS-CoV-2 primarily invades the respiratory system, and patients develop sore throat, fever, cough, and other pneumonia-associated symptoms. Moreover, it infects the nervous system (eg, headache, dizziness, and confusion), digestive system (eg, abdominal pain, diarrhea), and cardiovascular system (eg, chest pain, palmus, and cardiac injury). The incidence rate is 1.7-33.9% for headache, 0.7-47.1% for sore throat, 1.5-61.0% for myalgia/arthralgia, 1.6-17.7% for chest pain, and 1.9-14.5% for abdominal pain. In comparison with chest and abdominal pain, COVID-19 patients are more likely to develop headache, sore throat, and myalgia/arthralgia.

Conclusion

Different pain reflects the damage of different body systems. Therefore, the summary of pain symptoms for COVID-19 patients can help doctors improve the accuracy and efficiency of diagnosis when treating COVID-19 patients with atypical or mild symptoms and adopt more targeted treatment methods.

Questionnaire

In this study, the following symptoms were identified after being diagnosed with COVID-19: fever, cough, sputum, breathlessness (dyspnoea), hypersensitivity to sound, light and smell (sensory hypersensitivity), weakness and fatigue (fatigue), hair loss (alopecia), joint pain (arthralgia), muscle pain (myalgia), difficulty with muscle strength (muscle weakness), head pain (headache), sore throat, ringing in the ears (tinnitus), loss of consciousness (unconsciousness), abdominal pain, diarrhoea, bumps or redness on the skin (rash), numbness, eye-related symptoms (eye pain, itching, foreign body sensation, redness, watery eyes and eye discharge), memory loss and speechlessness (memory impairment), reduced ability to think and concentrate (poor concentration), and sleeping, taste, and olfactory disorders. Other symptoms that were not present in the 24 representative symptoms described above could be noted in an optional comment section in the questionnaire.

Patients were inquired on the presence of each symptom at the time of hospitalisation and at 3, 6 and 12 months after diagnosis. Medical information covering 168 clinical survey items during medical treatment at each facility was obtained using an electronic data capture system.

Study population

The flow diagram of this study is shown in figure 1. A total of 1066 patients answered a longitudinal questionnaire on long COVID-19 symptoms at least one time (3, and/or 6, and/or 12 months). We analysed the data of 935 patients who answered the longitudinal questionnaire at 3 months after diagnosis.

### The complexity of globus: a multidisciplinary perspective [^db50710d]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2014). Medium credibility.

Globus is a topic of interest for many specialties including otorhinolaryngology, gastroenterology and psychiatry/psychosomatic medicine, but, although many hypotheses have been suggested, key questions about its aetiology remain. This Review provides an overview of the extensive literature concerning this topic and discusses the quality of the evidence to date. Globus has been associated with oropharyngeal structural lesions, upper oesophageal sphincter disorders, oesophageal disorders, GERD, psychosocial factors and psychiatric comorbidity. However, findings are often contradictory and the literature remains highly inconclusive. Indeed, with the exception of patients with structural-based globus, the Rome III criteria for functional globus only apply to a subgroup of patients with idiopathic globus. In clinical reality, there exists a group of patients who present with idiopathic (nonstructural) globus, but nevertheless have dysphagia, odynophagia or GERD-exclusion criteria for globus diagnosis according to Rome III. The symptomatology of patients with globus might be broader than previously thought. It is therefore crucial to approach globus not from one single perspective, but from a multifactorial point of view, with focus on the coexistence and/or interactions of different mechanisms in globus pathogenesis. This approach could be translated to clinical practice by adopting a multidisciplinary method to patients presenting with globus.

### Sore throat turned to be a bronchogenic carcinoma with superior vena cava syndrome [^65ad03a2]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Case presentation

The affected patient was a 50-year-old man. Examination of his medical history showed that he was previously healthy with no record of chronic diseases. He also had no allergies but was a chronic smoker. On the first presentation to the primary health centre, he had a sore throat, a change of voice and a mild cough. He received a course of amoxicillin and the cough improved.

The patient later developed puffiness of the neck and face and shortness of breath, mostly at night. He was admitted to a private clinic where he received another course of antibiotics. However, this treatment did not yield any improvement. He then presented to the emergency department of this facility with the sore throat, a puffy face (figure 1), swelling of the neck and shortness of breath. He denied bleeding and vomiting, fever, neck pain, syncope and seizure. He also denied palpitation, chest pain, dizziness, abdominal pain, diarrhoea and dysuria. He had no contact with sick animals or patients.

Figure 1 
Puffiness of the face and mild periorbital oedema.

Physical examination of the patient showed an appearance of wellness and anxiety. He was vitally stable with temperature 38°C, pulse 106 beats/min, respiratory rate was 21 breath/min and O2 saturation of 99% on room air. There was mild puffiness of the face and mild left periorbital oedema. He had no drooling of saliva, stridor, nasal congestion, conjunctivitis, oral ulcer or a viral exanthem. He had no bulging of the pharyngeal wall, soft palate, or floor of the oropharynx. He had no neck pain, crepitus, trismus or stiff neck. He had no pharyngeal oedema, tonsillar exudates, cervical lymphadenitis or strawberry tongue.

There were enlarged tortuous superficial veins over the chest wall (figure 2). He was fully conscious and had no neurological deficit. His cardiovascular and respiratory system examination were normal. Bedside point-of-care ultrasound showed normal cardiac contractility, no pericardial effusion and no right-sided heart dilatation. The inferior vena cava was mildly dilated.

### Clinical issues in the prophylaxis, diagnosis, and treatment of anthrax [^85082905]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

The differential diagnosis of inhalational anthrax versus influenzalike illness is challenging. Respiratory viruses, including influenza, are common causes of influenzalike illness and tend to circulate in winter. These viruses are readily communicable, in contrast to anthrax, which is not spread from person to person. A history of influenza vaccination is not helpful in evaluating the likelihood of anthrax. Influenzalike illnesses have many causes besides influenza viruses, and influenza vaccine is not 100% effective. Unlike patients with inhalational anthrax, adults with influenza or other viral respiratory illnesses do not usually have shortness of breath and vomiting but often have sore throat or rhinorrhea. Rapid identification tests for influenza are available but vary widely in sensitivity.

In the current climate, emergency department and primary-care physicians should maintain a high index of suspicion for inhalational anthrax. Complicating diagnosis is the fact that patients initially may not appear very ill. A careful history with assessment of epidemiologic risk factors for anthrax (e.g. working for the postal service) should be obtained. Communication between clinicians and health authorities is critical for obtaining up-to-date assistance with diagnosis and management.

### Locally delivered flurbiprofen 8.75 mg for treatment and prevention of sore throat: a narrative review of clinical studies [^cb4b7b3d]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

URTI Symptoms

Sore throat associated with acute URTI is often accompanied by other troublesome upper respiratory tract symptoms, for example cough, post-nasal drip, swollen or tender neck glands, tickly throat, achiness and lack of energy.These can be assessed using the URTI questionnaire (Table 2). Schachtel et alobserved that significant numbers of patients treated with flurbiprofen lozenges, but not placebo, reported an absence of several URTI symptoms (achiness, pressure around the eyes, mouth breathing, lack of energy, tender neck glands, headache, loss of appetite, sinus pressure, coughing, chest tightness, or sinus pain) at 3 h post-dose compared to pretreatment (all p<0.05). In particular, among patients reporting cough at baseline, 46% (11/24 patients) reported no coughing at 3 h (p=0.01).

Burova et alalso demonstrated a significant reduction in the number of patients experiencing URTI symptoms with both flurbiprofen spray and lozenges. At 2 h post-dose, the number of patients experiencing URTI symptoms that can be attributed to or associated with sore throat (coughing, post-nasal drip, swollen neck glands, tender neck glands, throat tickle, and throat clearing) decreased relative to baseline. These decreases were statistically significant for every symptom, except tender neck glands (lozenge only; p=0.0881) and throat tickle (both formulations; p=0.3113 for spray and p=0.2249 for lozenge). There was an 85% and 54% reduction in the number of patients with cough from baseline to 2 h with spray and lozenge, respectively.

### Nationally representative SARS-CoV-2 antibody prevalence estimates after the first epidemic wave in Mexico [^886d906c]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

COVID-19 related symptoms

We constructed a variable of COVID-19 related symptoms to categorize participants in symptomatic, asymptomatic and pauci-symptomatic. The following question was answered by the head of the household in relation to their experience or that of their family members: “Between March 2020 and today did you (or any family member) present any of the following symptoms?” Informants were presented with 14 options: cough, fever, headache, sore or burning throat, runny nose, red eyes, muscle or joint pain, difficulty breathing, shortness of air, chest pain, vomiting, diarrhea, loss of smell, or taste, and other symptoms. Supplementary Fig. 8 shows the prevalence of symptoms by serostatus. Participants were classified as symptomatic if they met the “suspected case” definition of COVID-19 of Mexico’s Health Ministry: having at least one major symptom (cough, fever, headache, shortness of breath, or air in the lungs or chest pain) and one minor symptom (sore or burning throat, runny nose, red eyes, pain in muscles or joints, chest pain, loss of smell and loss of taste). Participants that did not fulfill the definition but experienced at least one symptom were considered “pauci-symptomatic”. Participants with no symptoms were considered asymptomatic.

### Should the reflex Be reflux? Throat symptoms and alternative explanations [^df071596]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2015). Low credibility.

Although laryngopharyngeal reflux, also known as extraesophageal reflux (EER), was codified more than 25 years ago, it has not been characterized fully. There is no sensitive and specific diagnostic test, and its symptoms often are nonspecific and overlap with those of other conditions commonly seen in primary care and specialist practices. Otolaryngologists have an important role in the evaluation and management of these patients--they must investigate persistent reflux-attributed symptoms by direct visualization of the upper airway and larynx, and, in some circumstances, the esophagus. It is of utmost importance to rule out the possibility of malignancy, which often presents with symptoms similar to those of EER. Once cancer is excluded, many benign upper airway conditions also can masquerade as, and often incorrectly are attributed to, EER. Although reflux is a potential etiologic factor for upper-airway symptoms, it is important not to reflexively blame reflux. We discuss other etiologies that should be considered carefully for persistent symptoms.

Secondary headaches are classified by the cause of the underlying disease process that is causing the headache. There are hundreds of secondary headache diagnoses and this article is not an exhaustive discussion of secondary headache disorders. Maintaining a high level of virulence and having a structured approach to evaluating all patients with headache is the key to timely diagnosis of secondary headache disorders. Diagnostic testing is indicated based on the suspected disorder and management is determined by treatment of the underlying disease causing the headache.

Consultative management of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) gastrointestinal (GI) and liver issues—best practice statements are as follows: In outpatients with new-onset diarrhea, ascertain information about high-risk contact exposure; obtain a detailed history of symptoms associated with COVID-19, including fever, cough, shortness of breath, chills, muscle pain, headache, sore throat, or new loss of taste or smell; and obtain a thorough history for other GI symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. In outpatients with new-onset GI symptoms (eg, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea), monitor for symptoms associated with COVID-19, as GI symptoms may precede COVID-related symptoms by a few days. In a high COVID-19 prevalence setting, COVID-19 testing should be considered. In hospitalized patients with suspected or known COVID-19, obtain a thorough history of GI symptoms (ie, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea), including onset, characteristics, duration, and severity. There is presently inadequate evidence to support stool testing for diagnosis or monitoring of COVID-19 as part of routine clinical practice. In patients (outpatients or inpatients) with elevated LFTs in context of suspected or known COVID-19, evaluate for alternative etiologies. In hospitalized patients with suspected or known COVID-19, obtain baseline LFTs at the time of admission and consider LFT monitoring throughout the hospitalization, particularly in the context of drug treatment for COVID-19. In hospitalized patients undergoing drug treatment for COVID-19, evaluate for treatment-related GI and hepatic adverse effects.

### Antibiotics for treatment of sore throat in children and adults [^d230c660]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Sore throat is a common reason for people to present for medical care and to be prescribed antibiotics. Overuse of antibiotics in primary medicine is a concern, hence it is important to establish their efficacy in treating sore throat and preventing secondary complications.  OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of antibiotics for reducing symptoms of sore throat for child and adult patients.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL 2021, Issue 2, MEDLINE (January 1966 to April week 1, 2021), Embase (January 1990 to April 2021), and two trial registries (searched 6 April 2021).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs of antibiotics versus control assessing typical sore throat symptoms or complications amongst children and adults seeking medical care for sore throat symptoms.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures as recommended by Cochrane. Two review authors independently screened studies for inclusion and extracted data, resolving any differences in opinion by discussion. We contacted the trial authors from three studies for additional information. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for the efficacy of antibiotics on our primary outcomes (sore throat at day three and one week) and secondary outcomes (fever and headache symptoms and incidence of acute rheumatic fever, acute glomerulonephritis, acute otitis media, acute sinusitis, and quinsy).

Main Results

We included 29 trials with 15,337 cases of sore throat. The majority of included studies were conducted in the 1950s, during which time the rates of serious complications (especially acute rheumatic fever) were much higher than today. Although clinical antibiotic trials for sore throat and respiratory symptoms are still being conducted, it is unusual for them to include placebo or 'no treatment' control arms, which is a requirement for inclusion in the review. The age of participants ranged from younger than one year to older than 50 years, but most participants across all studies were adults. Although all studies recruited patients presenting with symptoms of sore throat, few of them distinguished between bacterial and viral aetiology. Bias may have been introduced through non-clarity in treatment allocation procedures and lack of blinding in some studies. Harms from antibiotics were poorly or inconsistently reported, and were thus not quantified for this review. 1. Symptoms Throat soreness and headache at day three were reduced by using antibiotics, although 82% of participants in the placebo or no treatment group were symptom-free by one week. The reduction in sore throat symptoms at day three (risk ratio (RR) 0.70, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.60 to 0.80; 16 studies, 3730 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) was greater than at one week in absolute numbers (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.75; 14 studies, 3083 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) due to many cases in both treatment groups having resolved by this time. The number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) to prevent one sore throat at day three was less than six; at week one it was 18. Compared with placebo or no treatment, antibiotics did not significantly reduce fever at day three (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.07; 8 studies, 1443 participants; high-certainty evidence), but did reduce headache at day three (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.70; 4 studies, 1020 participants; high-certainty evidence). 2. Suppurative complications Whilst the prevalence of suppurative complications was low, antibiotics reduced the incidence of acute otitis media within 14 days (Peto odds ratio (OR) 0.21, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.40; 10 studies, 3646 participants; high-certainty evidence) and quinsy within two months (Peto OR 0.16, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.35; 8 studies, 2433 participants; high-certainty evidence) compared to those receiving placebo or no treatment, but not acute sinusitis within 14 days (Peto OR 0.46, 95% CI 0.10 to 2.05; 8 studies, 2387 participants; high-certainty evidence). 3. Non-suppurative complications There were too few cases of acute glomerulonephritis to determine whether there was a protective effect of antibiotics compared with placebo against this complication (Peto OR 0.07, 95% CI 0.00 to 1.32; 10 studies, 5147 participants; low-certainty evidence). Antibiotics reduced acute rheumatic fever within two months when compared to the control group (Peto OR 0.36, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.50; 18 studies, 12,249 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). It should be noted that the overall prevalence of acute rheumatic fever was very low, particularly in the later studies.

Authors' Conclusions

Antibiotics probably reduce the number of people experiencing sore throat, and reduce the likelihood of headache, and some sore throat complications. As the effect on symptoms can be small, clinicians must judge on an individual basis whether it is clinically justifiable to use antibiotics to produce this effect, and whether the underlying cause of the sore throat is likely to be of bacterial origin. Furthermore, the balance between modest symptom reduction and the potential hazards of antimicrobial resistance must be recognised. Few trials have attempted to measure symptom severity. If antibiotics reduce the severity as well as the duration of symptoms, their benefit will have been underestimated in this meta-analysis. Additionally, more trials are needed in low-income countries, in socio-economically deprived sections of high-income countries, as well as in children.

### Clinical guidance for group A streptococcal pharyngitis-CDC (...) [^2d54ac5a]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Many pathogens can cause pharyngitis.
- Patients with clear viral symptoms don't need testing for group A streptococcal bacteria.
- Confirm a negative rapid antigen detection test with a throat culture for symptomatic children aged 3 years or older.
- Treat group A streptococcal pharyngitis with antibiotics.
- Follow recommended guidelines when caring for patients with group A streptococcal pharyngitis. Cause Group A streptococcal pharyngitis is an infection of the oropharynx caused by Streptococcus pyogenes. The incubation period of group A strep pharyngitis is approximately 2 to 5 days. Keep ReadingGroup A Strep Bacteria and How They Spread.

Clinical features Acute pharyngitis symptoms It commonly presents with
- Fever
- Pain with swallowing
- Sudden onset of sore throat On clinical examination, patients with group A strep pharyngitis usually have
- Anterior cervical lymphadenopathy
- Palatal petechiae
- Pharyngeal and tonsillar erythema
- Tonsillar hypertrophy with or without exudates Patients with group A strep pharyngitis may also present with a scarlatiniform rash. The resulting syndrome is scarlet fever. Keep ReadingClinical Guidance for Scarlet Fever. Less common symptoms Other symptoms, especially among children, may include:
- Abdominal pain
- Headache
- Nausea and vomiting Subacute illness Respiratory disease caused by group A strep infection in children younger than 3 years of age rarely manifests as acute pharyngitis.

Instead, these children usually have what is called “streptococcal fever” or “streptococcosis, ” which involves mucopurulent rhinitis followed by:
- Anorexia
- Fever
- Irritability. Diagnosis Differential diagnosis The differential diagnosis of acute pharyngitis includes multiple viral and bacterial pathogens. Viruses are the most common cause of pharyngitis in all age groups. Experts estimate that group A strep, the most common bacterial cause, causes
- 20% to 30% of pharyngitis episodes in children
- 5% to 15% of pharyngitis infections in adults Clinical examination only with viral symptoms Healthcare providers can use history and clinical examination to diagnose viral pharyngitis when clear viral symptoms are present. These patients don't need testing for group A strep bacteria.

Testing and diagnosis To confirm group A strep pharyngitis, healthcare providers can use either
- A rapid antigen detection test
- Throat culture RADTs have high specificity for group A strep bacteria but varying sensitivities when compared to throat culture. Throat culture is the gold standard diagnostic test. Positive RADT or culture Healthcare providers can use a positive RADT or throat culture as confirmation of group A strep pharyngitis. Negative RADT Children older than 3 years: Healthcare providers should follow up a negative RADT with a throat culture. Have a mechanism in place to contact the family and initiate antibiotics if the back-up throat culture is positive. Giving antibiotics to children with confirmed group A strep pharyngitis can reduce their risk of developing acute rheumatic fever. All other ages: Throat culture after a negative RADT isn't routinely indicated. Acute rheumatic fever is very rare in these age groups.

### A dangerous cough [^5b6a3a3b]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

Patient X is a 48-year-old retired potteries worker who presented to his general practitioner (GP) with a non-productive cough, which had lasted over 1 month, and it was a television advert that he had seen that prompted him to visit his doctor. A cough is the most common presenting complaint for patients when they visit their GP and when considering differential diagnoses it is important to look at a patient's medical, drug and social history. It would have been easy for the GP to dismiss the cough as an exacerbation of the patient's asthma based on his medical history, but on further questioning into the patient's social history an emergency chest x-ray was ordered, which later revealed a bronchial carcinoma. This case highlights the importance of the media in healthcare advertising and describes how a fairly innocent presentation can later turn out to be a more sinister pathology.

### Progressive bilateral facial weakness [^b9132d2e]. Practical Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

A 72-year-old man presented with sudden onset of right-sided facial muscle weakness and slurred speech and a 3-day history of fevers, myalgia and sore throat. There was no hyperacusis, change in taste or lacrimation. His history included untreated hepatitis C diagnosed 10 years before, but quiescent at his annual liver review 8 weeks before presentation. He smoked cannabis intermittently but there was no recent alcohol or other drug abuse. There was a history of promiscuity with female partners.

On examination, he was alert and orientated. His blood pressure was elevated at 159/86 mm Hg but other vital signs and general examination were normal. Neurological examination showed a severe right-sided lower motor facial weakness with Bell's phenomenon (see online). The remaining cranial nerve examination was normal, including eye movements, pupillary responses, facial sensation, hearing, taste and otoscopy. There was mild left hip flexion weakness but preserved deep tendon reflexes. There was reduced sensation to temperature in a glove-and-stocking pattern; joint-position sense, light touch and pain sensation were intact. There was mild gait instability on walking tandem.

His condition progressed rapidly and on day 2 of admission he developed left-sided facial weakness (figure 1) with bilateral, proximal lower limb weakness. His paraesthesias were more painful. His lower limb deep tendon reflexes were no longer present (see online). Spirometry remained normal. He was transferred to a high dependency unit for ongoing monitoring.

AbstractMorning Report is a time-honored tradition where physicians-in-training present cases to their colleagues and clinical experts to collaboratively examine an interesting patient presentation. The Morning Report section seeks to carry on this tradition by presenting a patient's chief concern and story, inviting the reader to develop a differential diagnosis and discover the diagnosis alongside the authors of the case. This report examines the story of a 36-year-old man who sought evaluation for a persistent headache and numbness on the cheek. Using questions, physical examination, and testing, an illness script for the presentation emerges. As the clinical course progresses, the differential is refined until a diagnosis is made.

### Chronic cough due to gastroesophageal reflux in adults: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^8e61a160]. Chest (2016). Medium credibility.

Table 3 (continued)—Steward et al/2004 study design and assessments: Inclusion required “Hoarseness, throat clearing, nonproductive cough, globus sensation, or sore throat > 4 wk and physical examination consistent with LPR (ie, edema, erythema, or pachydermia, or a combination).” Treatment arms were “Rabeprazole 20 mg bid and lifestyle modifications (avoid fatty meals, caffeine, alcohol, smoking, eating within 2 h of bedtime, HOB elevation (n = 21 ITT, 16 PP) Placebo and lifestyle modifications (n = 21 ITT, 14 PP).” Cough-related outcomes used the “Reflux Symptom Questionnaire component: Dry cough defined as more than 4×/d scored 0-4 for frequency and severity.”

### Corticosteroids for sore throat: a clinical practice guideline [^798d6aab]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Understanding the recommendation

The recommendation for using corticosteroids made by the panel was weak because of the modest reduction of symptoms and the large variability in patient preferences.

The panel is confident that the recommendation applies to almost all patients with acute sore throat: children 5 years and older and adults, severe and not severe sore throat, patients who receive immediate antibiotics and those who receive deferred antibiotics, patients with a viral or bacterial sore throat, and patients who seek care in the emergency department as well as those who attend primary care. The systematic review contained adequate representation from such groups and settings, and results were consistent (that is, absence of credible subgroup effects), for example, between trials of children and adults, and those seen in emergency departments and in primary care offices.

### Stroke as an atypical initial presentation of giant cell arteritis [^c1a3454a]. BMC Geriatrics (2018). Low credibility.

In conclusion although there is a set of typical symptoms associated with giant cell arteritis, such as headache, scalp tenderness, jaw claudication, and visual disturbances, atypical symptoms in patients older than 50-years should also be considered for GCA. These atypical symptoms may include chronic cough, fever of unknown origin, and stroke symptoms especially if the patient’s ESR levels are elevated. Clinical decision-making should be driven by a high index of suspicion since no single test has perfect sensitivity. Whether a combination of ESR, CRP and temporal artery biopsy results can improve the diagnostic accuracy of GCA would need further study. As with all conditions, prompt diagnosis and the timely initiation of targeted treatment improves the chances of optimal outcomes.
