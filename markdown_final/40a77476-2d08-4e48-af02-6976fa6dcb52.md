## Question

What is the typical cerebrospinal fluid glucose level in neuromyelitis optica?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the typical cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) glucose level in neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) and how to interpret it in context. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about authoritative sources that explicitly address CSF glucose in NMOSD. Then, I should verify how often low CSF glucose (hypoglycorrhachia) actually occurs in NMOSD cohorts and case series. Next, I will contrast this with more typical patterns seen in NMOSD, such as pleocytosis and blood–CSF barrier dysfunction, to avoid overinterpreting rare anomalies. After that, I should review why low CSF glucose is classically seen in other CNS diseases and whether NMOSD pathophysiology plausibly explains hypoglycorrhachia. Finally, I will synthesize a cautious, clinically useful bottom line and note any caveats that might shift interpretation in atypical presentations.

> Let me first confirm what the contemporary guidelines say. The NEMOS recommendations list CSF glucose alongside basic CSF parameters but emphasize pleocytosis, blood–CSF barrier markers, oligoclonal bands, and lactate as diagnostically informative; they do not describe hypoglycorrhachia as a characteristic feature of NMOSD, which already suggests that low CSF glucose is not expected in typical cases [^115NjrZd].

> Wait, let me verify the largest NMOSD CSF dataset available. In a cohort of 211 lumbar punctures from AQP4-IgG–positive NMOSD, pleocytosis, protein abnormalities, and lactate changes were frequent, but low CSF glucose was not reported as a defining or even common feature, reinforcing that CSF glucose is usually normal in NMOSD [^1121YNVW].

> I will now examine whether isolated case reports ever show low CSF glucose. There is a reported NMOSD case initially suspected of bacterial meningomyelitis with CSF glucose 1.8 mmol/L (about 32 mg/dL), but this presentation was atypical and the low glucose flagged infection rather than typical NMOSD physiology, which argues that hypoglycorrhachia in NMOSD is rare and should prompt a search for alternative etiologies rather than be attributed to NMOSD itself [^1149qH5C].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — aseptic meningitis cohorts sometimes include rare low-glucose cases. In a series of 115 aseptic meningitis cases, only two had low CSF glucose and both were labeled as NMOSD with AQP4 seropositivity; notably, one had mild hypoglycorrhachia at 64 mg/dL and the other normalized quickly, underscoring that such low-glucose findings are exceptional in NMOSD and often raise concern for mimics or confounders rather than reflecting the usual NMOSD profile [^114PjwvC].

> Let me consider another series for consistency. A recent lupus-associated myelitis cohort with a substantial proportion of AQP4-positive NMOSD reported a higher proportion of low CSF glucose in double-seronegative patients compared with AQP4-positive NMOSD (60% vs 25%), but the absolute numbers were small, the difference was not statistically significant, and the clinical meaning remains uncertain — so I should be cautious about generalizing this as an NMOSD feature [^112dNUBb].

> Next, I should review why CSF glucose is usually normal in NMOSD. Low CSF glucose classically reflects either impaired glucose transport across the blood–CSF interface (as in GLUT1 deficiency), or consumption by pathogens and inflammatory cells in bacterial/fungal meningitis and leptomeningeal carcinomatosis; NMOSD pathophysiology centers on astrocytopathy and complement-mediated injury with pleocytosis and barrier dysfunction, not sustained glucose consumption or transporter failure, which aligns with the expectation of normal CSF glucose in typical attacks [^115s1sDy] [^117GF2Fw].

> Hmm, wait a minute — does inflammation alone explain hypoglycorrhachia here? Studies in meningitis show that inflammation per se is insufficient to lower CSF glucose. Active pathogen-driven changes and cellular glucose consumption are usually required, supporting the notion that aseptic inflammatory disorders like NMOSD rarely produce marked hypoglycorrhachia, though isolated exceptions can occur and may reflect sampling or analytic issues or concurrent processes [^111h83sQ] [^113yiBLY].

> I should double-check that I'm not missing guideline signals. Major NMOSD reviews and criteria emphasize pleocytosis, oligoclonal band patterns, and blood–CSF barrier markers. They do not elevate CSF glucose abnormalities into discriminative features for NMOSD, which strengthens the inference that low CSF glucose is not part of the typical NMOSD CSF profile and, when present, should trigger reassessment for infection, sarcoidosis, neoplastic meningitis, or other hypoglycorrhachia causes rather than being attributed to NMOSD alone [^115NjrZd] [^114GYCoj].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the practical bottom line. Typical CSF glucose in NMOSD is normal, with hypoglycorrhachia being rare and atypical; when low CSF glucose is encountered in a patient with suspected or confirmed NMOSD, I need to check serum glucose, reassess the differential for infectious, granulomatous, or neoplastic etiologies, and verify CSF-to-serum glucose ratios and repeat testing if needed, rather than assuming the low glucose is explained by NMOSD pathophysiology [^115s1sDy] [^112Av2Np].

---

The typical CSF glucose in NMOSD is **normal or only mildly reduced** [^112Av2Np] [^114PjwvC], with a CSF:serum glucose ratio ≥ 0.5. Low CSF glucose is **not a characteristic feature** of NMOSD and, when present, should prompt evaluation for alternative diagnoses such as infection, malignancy, or sarcoidosis [^112Av2Np] [^114PjwvC] [^115s1sDy]. CSF glucose should always be interpreted alongside serum glucose, cell count, protein, and clinical context [^115s1sDy].

---

## Normal CSF glucose levels

Normal CSF glucose typically ranges from **2.5 to 4.4 mmol/L (45–80 mg/dL)** [^115s1sDy], corresponding to a CSF:serum glucose ratio of 0.5–0.8 [^notfound]. This ratio is maintained by active glucose transport across the blood–brain barrier and is relatively independent of serum glucose fluctuations.

---

## CSF glucose levels in NMOSD

In NMOSD, CSF glucose is usually **normal or only mildly reduced**, reflecting minimal disruption of glucose transport across the blood–brain barrier [^112Av2Np]. Marked hypoglycorrhachia is uncommon and should raise suspicion of alternative diagnoses [^115s1sDy].

---

## Clinical evidence and studies

Several studies and case series provide insight into CSF glucose levels in NMOSD:

- **Normal glucose levels**: Most NMOSD patients have normal CSF glucose levels, even during acute relapses [^notfound].

- **Mild reductions**: Mild reductions in CSF glucose may occur in some patients, but these are typically not clinically significant and do not approach the low levels seen in infectious or malignant conditions [^notfound].

- **Rare cases of low glucose**: Rare cases of significantly low CSF glucose have been reported in NMOSD, but these are exceptional and often associated with atypical presentations or concurrent conditions [^1149qH5C].

---

## Factors influencing CSF glucose levels in NMOSD

Several factors can influence CSF glucose levels in NMOSD:

| **Factor** | **Effect on csf glucose** | **Clinical significance** |
|-|-|-|
| Blood–brain barrier integrity | Minimal disruption in NMOSD | Normal or mildly reduced glucose [^112Av2Np] |
| Inflammatory activity | Moderate pleocytosis and protein elevation | Mild glucose reduction possible [^112dNUBb] |
| Concurrent infections | Significant glucose consumption | Marked hypoglycorrhachia (rare in NMOSD) [^112Av2Np] |
| Malignancy or sarcoidosis | Altered glucose metabolism | Significant hypoglycorrhachia (rare in NMOSD) [^117Lo48R] |

---

## Clinical implications of CSF glucose levels in NMOSD

CSF glucose levels have **limited diagnostic value** in NMOSD; normal or mildly reduced levels neither confirm nor exclude the diagnosis. Significantly low CSF glucose should prompt evaluation for alternative diagnoses — such as infectious meningitis, leptomeningeal carcinomatosis, or neurosarcoidosis [^117Lo48R].

---

## Comparison with other neurological conditions

Compared with other neurological conditions, NMOSD typically shows normal or mildly reduced CSF glucose levels. In contrast, significantly low CSF glucose is a hallmark of bacterial or fungal meningitis, leptomeningeal carcinomatosis, and neurosarcoidosis [^117Lo48R] [^115s1sDy].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current clinical guidelines emphasize that CSF glucose analysis is part of the routine workup for suspected NMOSD, but **significantly low levels should prompt further evaluation** for alternative diagnoses [^115NjrZd] [^115s1sDy]. Clinicians should interpret CSF glucose levels in conjunction with other CSF parameters — such as protein, cell count, and oligoclonal bands — and the clinical context [^115s1sDy].

---

## Conclusion

In NMOSD, CSF glucose levels are typically **normal or only mildly reduced** [^112Av2Np], and marked hypoglycorrhachia is uncommon. When CSF glucose is significantly low, clinicians should consider alternative diagnoses, such as infection, malignancy, or sarcoidosis [^117Lo48R]. CSF glucose should be interpreted alongside other CSF parameters and the clinical context [^115NjrZd].

### Update on biomarkers in neuromyelitis optica [^116gUHAs]. Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

Neuromyelitis optica (NMO) (and NMO spectrum disorder) is an autoimmune inflammatory disease of the CNS primarily affecting spinal cord and optic nerves. Reliable and sensitive biomarkers for onset, relapse, and progression in NMO are urgently needed because of the heterogeneous clinical presentation, severity of neurologic disability following relapses, and variability of therapeutic response. Detecting aquaporin-4 (AQP4) antibodies (AQP4-IgG or NMO-IgG) in serum supports the diagnosis of seropositive NMO. However, whether AQP4-IgG levels correlate with disease activity, severity, response to therapy, or long-term outcomes is unclear. Moreover, biomarkers for patients with seronegative NMO have yet to be defined and validated. Collaborative international studies hold great promise for establishing and validating biomarkers that are useful in therapeutic trials and clinical management. In this review, we discuss known and potential biomarkers for NMO.

The presence of serum autoantibodies against aquaporin 4 (AQP4) is a distinct feature of NMOSD and distinguishes it from MS. 13, 14, 15 AQP4 is a water channel protein expressed predominantly on astrocytes and concentrated on the perivascular foot processes. Autoantibodies to AQP4 are pathogenic in NMOSD, 16, 17 resulting in targeted astrocyte dysfunction and destruction. Astrocyte injury results in the release of astrocyte contents in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum, 18, 19, 20 including glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), an intermediate filament protein predominantly expressed by astrocytes that forms the astrocyte cytoskeleton. 21 Therefore, serum GFAP (sGFAP) could be a biomarker of disease activity in NMOSD.

The aims of the current study were to investigate the relationship between prospectively sampled sGFAP concentration and disease activity in participants from the N‐MOmentum clinical trial and to assess the impact of inebilizumab on sGFAP levels compared with placebo, a predefined, exploratory study outcome.

Differential Diagnosis

The differential for a subacute encephalomyelopathy includes infectious, nutritional/metabolic, and immune-mediated/inflammatory disorders. Initial testing excluded a number of infectious etiologies. Clinical and radiologic features were used to further narrow the differential and guide directed testing.

Demographics and Clinical Features

As the patient had a progressive course extending beyond 3 months, the diagnosis of ADEM was considered unlikely. Other demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS) and antimyelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein disease usually affect younger adults. In addition, MS and neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder more often affect women than men. The temporal course of symptom development over weeks to months in this case is also atypical for demyelinating myelopathies, which usually develop over days to weeks. His CSF was negative for oligoclonal bands, also against a MS diagnosis. As such, demyelinating disease was considered unlikely in this patient.

The patient's older age raises other diagnostic considerations, including neurosarcoidosis, lymphoma, paraneoplastic, or nutritional/metabolic etiologies (e.g. vitamin B12 deficiency). However, the lack of cranial nerve involvement, pain, and lack of any systemic features of sarcoidosis argued against neurosarcoidosis. Moreover, the CSF analysis demonstrated normal protein and glucose levels also against sarcoidosis. He also reported weight loss, which could suggest a nutritional/metabolic deficiency, lymphoma, or paraneoplastic neurologic disorder (PND). However, the lack of headache, cranial nerve involvement, and normal CSF testing also argued against lymphoma.

CSF sampling and biomarker analysis

All 39 patients gave consent for usage of routine lumbar puncture values [CSF leucocyte count, immunoglobulin G (IgG) index and oligoclonal bands], whereas 34 of 39 patients gave consent for acquisition of additional study biomarkers from CSF. Twelve of 18 healthy controls gave consent for lumbar puncture and acquisition of study biomarkers. Routine analysis included CSF leucocyte and erythrocyte counts, measurement of CSF protein and glucose levels, IgG index and albumin quotient and test for oligoclonal bands by isoelectric focusing and immunoblotting. CSF (12 ml) was collected in an ice bath and immediately centrifuged at 400 g at 4°C for 10 min, and the cell-free supernatant was frozen and stored in 0.5 mL aliquots at −80°C until analysis. Levels of the biomarkers C-X-C motif chemokine 10 (CLCX10), C-X-C motif chemokine 13 (CLCX13) and matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) were analysed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) using commercially available kits as previously described.

RESULTS

Pregnancy, delivery, and the neonatal period were uneventful in all living members. The 8‐year‐old proband (IV‐1) developed, at age 4 years, childhood absence epilepsy (CAE) with attention‐deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and mild ID (Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children edition IV total intelligence quotient [IQ] = 85–95). Electroencephalography (EEG) revealed 3‐Hz generalized spike–wave discharges on normal background activity. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) detected right hippocampal sclerosis (HS; Figure 1b, c). In the past 18 months, ethosuximide (1 g/day) had been effective. The 51‐year‐old father (Patient III‐3) developed focal occipital epilepsy at age 12 years, well treated with carbamazepine (600 mg/day). At the age of 46 years, he developed acute self‐limiting paraparesis. He had no other comorbidities or prodromal illness. Spine MRI revealed increased T2 signal in the spinal cord with contrast enhancement at the T8–T9 level (Figure 1d, e). An extensive laboratory and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) workup ruled out infectious, toxic, metabolic, and immune‐mediated disorders. Oligoclonal bands, anti‐aquaporin‐4‐IgG, and anti‐myelin‐oligodendrocyte‐glycoprotein‐IgG were absent on serum and CSF. Brain MRI, electromyography, and nerve conduction studies were not contributory. At 38‐month follow‐up, neurological examination showed a mild gait disturbance; EEG, and brain and spine MRI were all unremarkable. We retrospectively calculated the glucose CSF‐to‐blood ratio and found a value of 0.40 (fasting glucose = 106 mg/dL, normal range = 74–106 mg/dL; CSF glucose = 45 mg/dL, normal range = 40–75), with normal lactate.

Acute Brain Slice Preparation

Ex vivo acute brain slice experiments were performed as previously described. 29 In brief, brains from Aldh1l1 :GFP mice were removed, cut centrally into coronal slices (300 µm) in Ringer's/artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF; pH 7.4 at 4 °C) containing (in mM): 125 NaCl, 26 NaHCO 3, 2.5 KCl, 1.25 NaH 2 PO 4, 2 CaCl 2, 1 MgCl 2, and 20 glucose, followed by recovery at 35 °C for 1 hour. Slices were transferred to a recording chamber and continuously superfused with 50ml of recirculating, heated (30 °C), and oxygenated (95% O 2 /5% CO 2) aCSF (1.5–2.0ml/min). After complement inactivation at 56 °C for 30 minutes, we applied diluted NMO or control sera/plasma (IgG levels adjusted to the values indicated in the figures), together with 4% non‐heat‐inactivated serum from healthy donors (HDs) as a source of complement (referred to as HD serum below), which remained in the aCSF from 0 to 180 minutes of the experiment. Image stacks (∼30 images, 2‐µm z‐spacing) were acquired using a two‐photon microscope (Olympus FV1000 MPE tuned to 910 nm, equipped with a ×25/1.05 numerical aperture [N. A.] water dipping cone objective; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) at 3‐minute intervals for 3 hours.

Analysis of CSF is daily routine in patients with acute neurologic disorders like CNS infections. In those patients, the finding of a low CSF glucose may influence further diagnostic workup and therapeutic choices. The interpretation of a low CSF glucose in patients with a chronic neurologic disorder, however, is a less common practice. We present a practical overview on the differential diagnosis of a low CSF glucose and stress the importance of recognizing a low CSF glucose as the diagnostic marker for GLUT1 deficiency syndrome, a treatable neurometabolic disorder.

Serum inflammatory markers

Although raised ESR and other serum inflammatory markers have been found to be associated with disease activity in BD, no definite identifiable pattern has been recognised to be linked with NBD activity. Few studies have reported concurrent appearance or worsening of systemic features and non-specific constitutional symptoms at the neurological presentation, whilst one study reported only modest elevations in inflammatory markers in less than a quarter of NBD patients.

Neuroimaging

Neuroimaging has a significant role in the diagnosis of NBD; MRI is the gold-standard neuro-imaging modality. MRI abnormalities have been well-described in NBD. The consensus characteristics of MRI lesions are listed in Table 4.

MRI is extremely useful in differentiating NBD from its mimics. The brainstem–thalamic–basal ganglia lesions, in the proper clinical context can strongly support the diagnosis of acute/subacute parenchymal NBD, and on occasions can raise this possibility even when the systemic features of BD are scarce. Chronic parenchymal NBD lesions are iso-intense, smaller, and at times difficult to differentiate from lesions seen in multiple sclerosis.

In general, multiple sclerosis lesions are predominantly periventricular, with infrequent involvement of the basal ganglia, internal capsule, and the peripheral part of the pons, whilst chronic parenchymal NBD lesions are predominantly subcortical. Brainstem atrophy in association with subcortical lesions points toward NBD. In neuro-Lupus, though sub-cortical white matter lesions are seen, basal ganglia or brainstem involvement is uncommon.

CSF

Cerebrospinal fluid constituents are altered in around 70–80% of patients with parenchymal NBD. CSF protein is modestly raised in most cases, and oligoclonal bands are usually absent. The CSF cell count is raised in 60–80% of parenchymal NBD cases (range 0–400 × 10⁶ cells/L) and there could be CSF neutrophilia, lymphocytosis, or mixed cellularity. CSF glucose is usually normal in NBD and low levels point toward CNS infections.

Patients with CVT or intracranial hypertension without CVT (pseudotumour cerebri) have normal CSF constituents, but usually high CSF opening pressure.

### International consensus diagnostic criteria for neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders [^112GMkXM]. Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

The Clinical Presentation and Neuroimaging Working Groups compiled a list of clinical syndromes and MRI characteristics reported by more than one publication to be associated with NMOSD or AQP4-IgG. Panel members rated the specificity of these characteristics for NMOSD diagnosis using 2 electronic surveys. Two additional surveys presented adult case vignettes that contained information on clinical symptoms and signs (1–3 discrete clinical events) with brain MRI, AQP4-IgG serostatus, and other potential supportive criteria (optic nerve or spinal cord MRI findings) or laboratory results (e.g. CSF data, visual evoked potentials). Panel members assigned a diagnosis for each vignette: definite NMOSD, indeterminate (requiring further data or follow-up for confident diagnosis), or other (e.g. MS). A roster of potential supportive clinical, MRI, and laboratory criteria was separately ranked for their influence on confidence in NMOSD diagnosis. Characteristics or scenarios endorsed by a two-thirds Panel majority as contributing to a confident clinical diagnosis of NMOSD were used to develop separate requirements for AQP4-IgG seropositive and seronegative patients. Recommendations from individual Working Groups regarding pediatric NMOSD, opticospinal MS, systemic autoimmunity, and monophasic disease were summarized. All IPND members endorsed the final criteria.

### Guidelines on routine cerebrospinal fluid analysis. report from an EFNS task force [^115s1sDy]. European Journal of Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

A great variety of neurological diseases require investigation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to prove the diagnosis or to rule out relevant differential diagnoses. The objectives were to evaluate the theoretical background and provide guidelines for clinical use in routine CSF analysis including total protein, albumin, immunoglobulins, glucose, lactate, cell count, cytological staining, and investigation of infectious CSF. The methods included a Systematic Medline search for the above-mentioned variables and review of appropriate publications by one or more of the task force members. Grading of evidence and recommendations was based on consensus by all task force members. It is recommended that CSF should be analysed immediately after collection. If storage is needed 12 mL of CSF should be partitioned into three to four sterile tubes. Albumin CSF/serum ratio (Qalb) should be preferred to total protein measurement and normal upper limits should be related to patients' age. Elevated Qalb is a non-specific finding but occurs mainly in bacterial, cryptococcal, and tuberculous meningitis, leptomingeal metastases as well as acute and chronic demyelinating polyneuropathies. Pathological decrease of the CSF/serum glucose ratio or increased lactate concentration indicates bacterial or fungal meningitis or leptomeningeal metastases. Intrathecal immunoglobulin G synthesis is best demonstrated by isoelectric focusing followed by specific staining. Cellular morphology (cytological staining) should be evaluated whenever pleocytosis is found or leptomeningeal metastases or pathological bleeding is suspected. Computed tomography-negative intrathecal bleeding should be investigated by bilirubin detection.

### Newly emerging type B insulin resistance (TBIR) during treatment with eculizumab for AQP4-IgG-positive neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD): fatal outcome [^115UUjX2]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, (1.) TBIR needs to be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients with NMOSD and disturbed glucose homeostasis, especially, but not exclusively, in patients with co-existing SLE; (2.) while eculizumab (like the closely related drug ravulizumab) remains a highly effective treatment option for AQP4-IgG-positive NMOSD, the case described here highlights the risks associated with its use in patients who have autoimmune comorbidities that can compromise immune function and who may thus be at high risk of developing severe infectious complications. More data on the risk/benefit ratio of eculizumab in such patients are needed. Careful selection of patients for treatment with eculizumab, effective and timely immunization, and close monitoring for signs of infection in treated patients are essential.

### Cerebrospinal fluid aquaporin-4 antibody levels in neuromyelitis optica attacks [^112ARMko]. Annals of Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

NMOSD attacks are usually severe and patients have a high risk of disability. Understanding the mechanisms that promote the BBB disruption and/or the migration of pathogenic memory B cells resulting in the presence of large amounts of AQP4 antibodies in the CNS can provide new therapeutic strategies to treat NMOSD patients in a more tailored approach with less of the risks and side effects found in B-cell depletion with rituximab, immunosuppressive drugs, and corticosteroids. Furthermore, strategies blocking the binding of pathogenic AQP4 antibodies to their antigen in the CNSor preserving BBB integrity may reduce the astrocyte damage and permanent disability due to NMOSD attacks.

### Novel cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers of glucose transporter type 1 deficiency syndrome: implications beyond the brain's energy deficit [^115MrXpW]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

We used next‐generation metabolic screening to identify new biomarkers for improved diagnosis and pathophysiological understanding of glucose transporter type 1 deficiency syndrome (GLUT1DS), comparing metabolic cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) profiles from 12 patients to those of 116 controls. This confirmed decreased CSF glucose and lactate levels in patients with GLUT1DS and increased glutamine at group level. We identified three novel biomarkers significantly decreased in patients, namely gluconic + galactonic acid, xylose‐α1‐3‐glucose, and xylose‐α1‐3‐xylose‐α1‐3‐glucose, of which the latter two have not previously been identified in body fluids. CSF concentrations of gluconic + galactonic acid may be reduced as these metabolites could serve as alternative substrates for the pentose phosphate pathway. Xylose‐α1‐3‐glucose and xylose‐α1‐3‐xylose‐α1‐3‐glucose may originate from glycosylated proteins; their decreased levels are hypothetically the consequence of insufficient glucose, one of two substrates for O ‐glucosylation. Since many proteins are O ‐glucosylated, this deficiency may affect cellular processes and thus contribute to GLUT1DS pathophysiology. The novel CSF biomarkers have the potential to improve the biochemical diagnosis of GLUT1DS. Our findings imply that brain glucose deficiency in GLUT1DS may cause disruptions at the cellular level that go beyond energy metabolism, underlining the importance of developing treatment strategies that directly target cerebral glucose uptake.

CSF abnormalities.

Lumbar puncture was performed after MRI investigation in all patients, and complete CSF analysis was available at the time of the LME for 6 of the 11 patients. CSF examination showed pleocytosis > 50 mL (/mm³) in all cases; 2 cases with increased polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNLs) had 80% (PMNL 166 and mononuclear leukocyte [MNL] 41/mm³) and 98% (PMNL 212 and MNL 4/mm³) PMNL, respectively. The combination of LME and pleocytosis in all cases, especially in the 2 cases with increased CSF-PMNL and fever, led to extensive virologic and bacteriologic workup, which proved negative both in blood and CSF. The median CSF protein concentration was 169 (range 54–322) (mg/dL), and CSF glucose level was normal in all cases. CSF-restricted oligoclonal bands or elevated IgG CSF/serum ratio were absent, except in 1 patient. AQP4-IgG in CSF was only measured in 2 patients, and it was positive in both patients.

LME and clinical disease activity.

When LME was visible on MRI, all patients had experienced attacks with subacute onset and progressive neurologic deficits over a few weeks (7 patients) or with acute onset and rapid progression within a few days (4 patients). Median interval between symptom onset and MRI scans displaying LME was 12 days (range 2–30 days). Seven patients had longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis (LETM) (4 subacute and 3 acute onset) and 4 had cerebral syndromes (CS) (3 with subacute and 1 with acute onset) as the clinical presentation associated with LME (table e-1).

Low glucose in aseptic meningitis.

Among aseptic meningitis cases (n = 115), only 11 cases (9.6%) had CSF glucose lower than 40 mg/dL (median 33, range 16–37 mg/dL). Eight cases were neurosarcoidosis (half confirmed by brain and the other half by lung biopsy), a diagnosis that has been associated with hypoglycorrhachia in the literature. The remaining cases were 2 neuromyelitis optica with positive aquaporin-4 serum antibodies (one with mild hypoglycemia of 64 mg/dL and the other with correction of the hypoglycorrhachia on the next day) and 1 brain biopsy–confirmed small vessel CNS vasculitis with associated leptomeningitis. The median age was 43 years (range 28–64 years), and 9 were women. CSF inflammatory markers were moderately elevated including proteins (median 125, range 65–300 mg/dL) and leukocytes (median 58, range 9–685 × 10⁶ cells/L) with a lymphocytic predominance (78.4% ± 27.7% lymphocytes and 3.3% ± 4.5% neutrophils).

### Cerebrospinal fluid aquaporin-4 antibody levels in neuromyelitis optica attacks [^114AMzV7]. Annals of Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

To elucidate immunopathogenetic roles of aquaporin-4 antibodies in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (NMOSD), we analyzed aquaporin-4 antibody titers, cellular and inflammatory markers in the CSF collected from 11 aquaporin-4 antibody seropositive patients. The CSF aquaporin-4 antibody levels during attacks (but not in sera) closely correlated with pleocytosis, inflammatory cytokines including interleukin-6 that can regulate antibody-producing plasmablasts, and glial fibrillary acidic protein levels in the CSF. The amount of aquaporin-4 antibodies present in the central nervous system may have therapeutic implications, as it is associated with astrocyte injury and inflammatory responses during NMOSD attacks.

### Clinical utility of AQP4-IgG titers and measures of complement-mediated cell killing in NMOSD [^113R8cFp]. Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

In regard to the lack of clear association between AQP4-IgG titers and clinical course or outcome, additional explanations may be related to the basis of interindividual and intraindividual variability with respect to (1) avidity/affinity; it is possible that measures of affinity (strength of interaction between the epitope and the antibody's antigen binding site) and avidity (overall strength of the antigen-antibody complex) could affect functional pathogenicity of antibody-antigen interaction. Studies investigating avidity and affinity in individual patient sera and CSF would be of interest for further research; (2) epitope specificity; (3) complement regulatory protein function; and (4) blood-brain barrier permeability and coexistence of glucose-regulated protein 78 autoantibody. Given the relapsing nature of AQP4-IgG + NMOSD and the fact that antibody titers may be high during periods of remission indicate that a multitude of immunologic steps are likely required in addition to the presence of the antibody. These steps remain elusive to date.

### Cerebrospinal fluid aquaporin-4 antibody levels in neuromyelitis optica attacks [^115eGiEx]. Annals of Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

Neuromyelitis optica (NMO) and the limited forms known as NMO spectrum disorders (NMOSD) are characterized by severe attacks of optic neuritis and/or longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis (LETM). A significant proportion of NMOSD patients are seropositive for aquaporin-4 (AQP4) antibodies. The primary target for these autoantibodies is the AQP4, a water channel richly expressed in the foot processes of astrocytes. Immunoglobulin G (IgG) deposits with complement activation in perivascular areas, associated with astrocyte loss, are observed in acute NMOSD lesions.

We previously reported a remarkable increase in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), an astrocyte-specific marker during NMOSD attacks. The GFAP elevation was far more pronounced than myelin and neuronal markers, indicating that astrocytes are the primary target cells in these patients with AQP4 antibodies. Previous studies have found elevated interleukin (IL)−6 and other cytokine levels in the CSF of NMOSD patients compared to multiple sclerosis (MS) patients and controls, and that the concentration of IL-6 seems to correlate with GFAP levels.–However, AQP4 antibody titers in the serum did not correlate with GFAP levels in 1 study, and no study has evaluated AQP4 antibody titers in the CSF. In this pilot study, we evaluated AQP4 antibody levels measured directly in the CSF during attacks using our highly sensitive cell-based assay (CBA) for AQP4 antibodies, and correlated these levels with astrocyte damage and the cytokine profile.

### Mechanisms for lesion localization in neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders [^1118wxge]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose of review

Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (NMOSD) are severe inflammatory diseases of the central nervous system (CNS), with the presence of aquaporin 4 (AQP4)-specific serum antibodies in the vast majority of patients, and with the presence of myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)-specific antibodies in approximately 40% of all AQP4-antibody negative NMOSD patients. Despite differences in antigen recognition, the preferred sites of lesions are similar in both groups of patients: They localize to the spinal cord and to the anterior visual pathway including retina, optic nerves, chiasm, and optic tracts, and – to lesser extent – also to certain predilection sites in the brain.

Recent findings

The involvement of T cells in the formation of NMOSD lesions has been challenged for quite some time. However, several recent findings demonstrate the key role of T cells for lesion formation and localization. Studies on the evolution of lesions in the spinal cord of NMOSD patients revealed a striking similarity of early NMOSD lesions with those observed in corresponding T-cell-induced animal models, both in lesion formation and in lesion localization. Studies on retinal abnormalities in NMOSD patients and corresponding animals revealed the importance of T cells for the very early stages of retinal lesions which eventually culminate in damage to Müller cells and to the retinal nerve fiber layer. Finally, a study on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) barrier pathology demonstrated that NMOSD immunopathology extends beyond perivascular astrocytic foot processes to include the pia, the ependyma, and the choroid plexus, and that diffusion of antibodies from the CSF could further influence lesion formation in NMOSD patients.

Summary

The pathological changes observed in AQP4-antibody positive and MOG-antibody positive NMOSD patients are strikingly similar to those found in corresponding animal models, and many mechanisms which determine lesion localization in experimental animals seem to closely reflect the human situation.

Laboratory Testing

Most patients (n = 40/41, 98%) were tested at least once for serum AQP4-IgG, and 20 (49%) of 41 were positive by CBA or ELISA. The 1 patient without a documented AQP4-IgG test was presumed seronegative for the analysis. Of 21 AQP4-IgG seronegative patients, 6 were tested only by ELISA without any recorded CBA. Serum MOG-IgG testing was performed in 17 (41%) of 41 patients by CBA (56% fixed/44% live), with 4 (24%) of 17 positive, including one that was considered to be a false positive in the setting of borderline titer (1:20 by live CBA) and concurrent high-titer AQP4-IgG seropositivity (1:1,000 by live CBA), with clinical features consistent with AQP4-IgG seropositive NMOSD. Full neurologic and rheumatologic serology findings are detailed in eTable 2.

Seventeen (63%) of 27 patients in the total cohort with available CSF analysis had pleocytosis (7 polymorphonuclear, 8 lymphocytic predominant, 2 unknown). CSF-restricted oligoclonal bands (OCBs), where data were available, were present in 5 (42%) of 12 "double-seronegative" compared with 3 (25%) of 12 in the AQP4-IgG seropositive NMOSD group. When examining CSF white blood cell count collected within 30 days of myelitis onset, this was overall higher in "double-seronegative" patients compared with the AQP4-IgG seropositive NMOSD group (eTable 2; p = 0.34) but this was not statistically significant. The proportion with CSF glucose ≤ 50 mg/dL was greater in the "double-seronegative" group (6 of 10, 60%) vs AQP4-IgG seropositive NMOSD group (2 of 8, 25%; p = 0.36), but this difference was also not statistically significant. CSF MOG-IgG CBAs were performed in 4 patients with negative results in all cases (including 1 patient with MOGAD and serum MOG-IgG 1:1,000 by live CBA). Remaining CSF findings including OCB patterns can be found in eTable 2.

A 44-year-old woman presented with prolonged low-grade fever, bilateral upper limb weakness, and hyperesthesia. MRI showed hyperintense T2 signal and enhancement of the cervicothoracic spinal cord. F-FDG PET/CT was requested to investigate pyrexia of unknown origin. It demonstrated diffusely increased FDG uptake along the entire spinal cord, suggestive of extensive acute myelitis. Initial blood work was positive for antinuclear antibodies and anti-Ro/SSA antibodies. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis revealed lymphocytosis and detected the presence of neuromyelitis optica aquaporin-4-immunoglobulin G antibodies, fulfilling the criteria for diagnosis of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder.

### CSF sphingolipids are correlated with neuroinflammatory cytokines and differentiate neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder from multiple sclerosis [^111ixMG2]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

Another limitation of our study was the absence of healthy controls, which prevented us from establishing the normal range for CSF lipids. CSF examination is not routinely carried out in healthy individuals and accordingly, NIND is commonly used as a control group for CSF biomarker studies. A third limitation is that the cohort of untreated MS cases used to validate associations of lipids with EDSS scores had a narrow spread of EDSS scores in the low range. This likely produced an underestimation of the strength of correlations between lipid levels and EDSS. Lastly, BMI was not available for many of our samples, which prevented us from adjusting for BMI in our analyses. However, BMI did not correlate with any CSF lipids in the 33 samples for which this metric was available.

### Cerebrospinal fluid evidence of increased extra-mitochondrial glucose metabolism implicates mitochondrial dysfunction in multiple sclerosis disease progression [^114254FQ]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2008). Low credibility.

In contrast to relapse, the mechanisms of multiple sclerosis (MS) disease progression are less understood and appear not to be exclusively inflammatory in nature. In this pilot study we investigated the relationship between disturbed CNS energy metabolism and MS disease progression. We tested the hypothesis that cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations of sorbitol, fructose, and lactate, all metabolites of extra-mitochondrial glucose metabolism, would be elevated in secondary progressive (SP) MS patients and would be associated with worsening neurologic disability. We measured metabolite concentrations by gas chromatographic/mass spectrometric and enzymatic methods in archived CSF samples from 85 MS patients [31 relapsing-remitting (RR) and 54 SP patients] and 18 healthy controls. We found that concentrations of all three metabolites, but not concentrations of glucose or myoinositol, were significantly increased in CSF from SP and, to a lesser degree, RR patients, compared to controls. Furthermore, CSF concentrations of sorbitol and fructose (polyol pathway metabolites), but not lactate (anaerobic glycolysis metabolite), correlated positively and significantly with Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score, an index of neurologic disability in MS patients. We conclude that extra-mitochondrial glucose metabolism is increased in MS patients and is associated with disease progression evidenced by increasing EDSS score. As extra-mitochondrial glucose metabolism increases with impaired mitochondrial metabolism of glucose, these findings implicate mitochondrial dysfunction in the pathogenesis of MS disease progression. CSF metabolic profiling may be useful in clarifying the role of mitochondrial pathology in progression and in targeting and monitoring therapies for disease progression that aim to preserve or boost mitochondrial glucose metabolism.

### International consensus diagnostic criteria for neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders [^117BvV6z]. Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

During optic neuritis attacks, increased signal within the optic nerve may be detected with fat-suppressed T2-weighted orbital MRI sequences, typically with gadolinium enhancement seen on T1-weighted sequences (figure 1). Bilateral optic nerve involvement, posterior nerve predominance (especially with extension into the optic chiasm), or extensive lesions of the optic nerve (more than half of its length) are all suggestive of NMOSD (table 3). e51, e73, e74

According to the 2006 diagnostic scheme, a normal brain MRI or detection of only nonspecific white matter lesions was a key supportive criterion. Sixty percent of patients with NMOSD accumulate asymptomatic white matter lesions on longitudinal study and as many as 16% fulfill Barkhof MS MRI criteria., e75–e76 Detection of brain MRI white matter lesions compatible with MS does not exclude the diagnosis of NMOSD but is considered a red flag, indicating that additional evidence may be required to confidently distinguish NMOSD from MS in individual cases.e64, e76, e77 Analysis of qualitative features of lesions assists in distinguishing NMOSD from MS. First, at least 7% of patients have NMOSD-typical patterns that, although not pathognomonic for NMOSD, are considered exceptional for MS (table 3), including lesions of the dorsal medulla/area postrema (figure 2), e36, e73, e78 and periependymal regions in the brainstem (figure 2), e36, e73 and diencephalic structures, e79 or cerebral hemispheres e80 (figure 3), or long lesions spanning much of the length of the corpus callosum, or corticospinal tracts (figure 3). Large, confluent, or tumefactive cerebral lesions may suggest NMOSD but in isolation may not be discernable from atypical MS lesions, especially in AQP4-IgG-seronegative patients., e46, e81−e83 Second, some MRI lesion patterns considered typical of MS are rarely seen in NMOSD, including perpendicular orientation of periventricular lesions (Dawson fingers), periventricular lesions located in the inferior temporal lobe, and cortical lesions., e64 Recent 7T MRI studies revealed differences between NMOSD and MS specifically regarding cortical lesions (frequent in MS but absent in NMOSD) and white matter lesions (MS plaques are periventricular and traversed by a central venule whereas NMOSD lesions are subcortical and lack a central venule). e84, e85 However, this technology is not widely available and further validation is needed.

### Practice parameter: evaluation of distal symmetric polyneuropathy: role of laboratory and genetic testing (an evidence-based review). Report of the American Academy of Neurology, American association of neuromuscular and electrodiagnostic medicine, and American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation [^1178NkSH]. Neurology (2009). Medium credibility.

Distal symmetric polyneuropathy (DSP) — screening laboratory tests and recommendations indicate variable yields and targeted use: In patients with DSP, blood glucose was elevated in approximately 11%, serum protein electrophoresis or immunofixation was abnormal in 9%, and serum B12 was low in approximately 3.6%. Screening laboratory tests may be useful in determining the cause of DSP, but the yields vary depending upon the particular test (Class III), and the tests with the highest yield of abnormality are blood glucose, serum B12 with metabolites (methylmalonic acid and/or homocysteine), and serum protein immunofixation electrophoresis (Level C). When routine blood glucose testing is not clearly abnormal, other tests for prediabetes (impaired glucose tolerance) such as a glucose tolerance testing (GTT) may be considered in patients with distal symmetric sensory polyneuropathy, especially if it is accompanied by pain (Level C). Impaired glucose tolerance was documented in 25–36% of patients compared to approximately 15% of controls, and patients with painful sensory polyneuropathies were more likely to have impaired glucose tolerance than those with painless sensory polyneuropathies. Two Class III studies showed that routine cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis had a low diagnostic yield except in demyelinating polyneuropathies, which usually showed an increased CSF protein level, and although there are no control studies (Level U) regarding when to recommend the use of specific laboratory tests, clinical judgment will determine which additional laboratory investigations are necessary.

### New therapies for neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder [^114i9CZU]. The Lancet: Neurology (2021). High credibility.

Background

Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder is an autoimmune disease of the CNS that primarily affects the optic nerves and spinal cord. Most patients have serum antibodies targeting the aquaporin-4 water channel expressed on the end-feet of astrocytes. Although the prevalence of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder is limited to around 1–2 people per 100000, severe immune-mediated attacks can quickly lead to blindness and paralysis if undiagnosed and untreated. However, diagnosis is straightforward when the highly specific serum aquaporin-4 antibodies are detected with cell-based assays.

Recent Developments

Four randomised controlled trials have tested the efficacy of three new therapies (eculizumab, satralizumab, and inebilizumab) for patients with neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder that all showed a benefit in preventing future attacks. These therapies have different targets within the immune pathogenic process, and the four trials have similarities and differences that mean they might change the therapeutic landscape for people with neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder in different ways. Efficacy, safety, tolerability, and practical considerations, including potential cost, differ for each drug and might affect the rate of use in real-world populations of patients with neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder. WHERE NEXT? Despite the rarity of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder, a relative abundance of preventive treatment options now exists. In the future, trials should focus on areas of unmet need, including aquaporin-4 seronegative disease, and on development of treatments for acute relapses and for recovery from autoimmune attacks in the CNS.

Practical recommendations — antibody testing

AQP4-IgG testing is recommended in all patients with clinical or clinico-radiological findings (either present or previous) that would permit the diagnosis of "NMOSD with positive AQP4-IgG serostatus" in the case of a positive test result according to the IPND criteria, i.e. in all patients with one of the core characteristics listed in Box 1, and in all patients diagnosed with "NMOSD with unknown AQP4-IgG serostatus" according to the IPND criteria. In all other cases, the decision on whether or not to test for AQP4-IgG testing should be made individually; however, broad, unselected screening of patients with MS that do not meet the above-mentioned criteria is discouraged, especially in regions of the world in which NMOSD accounts only for a small proportion of IDD cases, since this practice may result in an unfavorable ratio of false-positive to true-positive results. Typical indications for MOG-IgG testing are listed in Supplementary Box 2. Both AQP4-IgG and MOG-IgG (to rule out MOG-EM/MOGAD in patients meeting the IPND criteria for "NMOSD with AQP4-IgG-negative serostatus") must be tested by means of cell-based assays (CBA). The assay must employ either fixed or live cells expressing conformationally intact, full-length recombinant human AQP4 or MOG protein, respectively, as antigenic substrate and mock-transfected (or, at minimum, non-transfected) cells as control substrate.

### Update on biomarkers in neuromyelitis optica [^116y8XXF]. Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

DESIGN OF LITERATURE REVIEW

Along with manual literature review by authors with expertise in the field, published peer-reviewed articles were interrogated to assess the current knowledge about biomarkers in NMO/NMOSD. A search of the PubMed database (National Center for Biotechnology Information, US National Library of Medicine) was performed using the query terms "biomarker", "NMO", "opticospinal multiple sclerosis (OSMS)", "blood", "serum", and "CSF". NMO and NMOSD met the criteria proposed by Wingerchuk et al. The analysis included published literature up to 2014. Although it was not possible to cite every published report in this review, all of the meritorious efforts to discover and validate potential biomarkers in NMO/NMOSD are appreciated. Every effort was made to highlight universally accepted themes. See the figure for a summary of biomarker candidates in NMO and MS and their current evidence levels.

### Pleocytosis is not fully responsible for low CSF glucose in meningitis [^111h83sQ]. Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

The strengths of this study include a relatively large sample size as compared to previously published data that encompassed a wide variety of confirmed etiologies including more recently recognized entities in the aseptic category, such as meningitides related to immunologic disturbances. The baseline characteristics were fairly balanced aside from an overrepresentation of men in the microbial category that we could not explain, as there are no reports suggesting a sex difference in this disease. As planned, the microbial category encompassed cases with a history of neurosurgery that may have had an impact on the blood-brain barrier permeability and thus bias glucose measurements. However, we feel that this is part of the variability of the clinical setting and serves to increase the generalizability of our findings. Indeed, repeating the analysis excluding cases with a history of neurosurgery yielded the same results (supplemental data).

In conclusion, the data presented here shed light on meningitis pathophysiology by suggesting that the presence of a pathogen and the induced changes in CSF milieu, rather than inflammation alone, underlie hypoglycorrhachia. The practical correlate is that aseptic meningitis, even with a high level of leukocytes, should remain a diagnosis of exclusion if low — especially very low (< 30 mg/dL) — CSF glucose is present. Our data also support trending CSF glucose as a marker of treatment response and suggest that CSF glucose alone is a relatively specific marker of microbial meningitis, although the CSF-to-serum ratio may be better in borderline cases. The early assessment of CSF glucose remains a vital component of the workup when a patient presents with signs of meningitis, as it can help distinguish between microbial meningitis requiring antimicrobial therapy and aseptic cases requiring very different treatment.

### International consensus diagnostic criteria for neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders [^114GYCoj]. Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

Patients who fulfill NMOSD criteria but do not have detectable AQP4-IgG despite use of the best available assays, or for whom serologic testing is unavailable, sometimes represent a diagnostic challenge. A greater proportion of patients with NMO who have monophasic disease appear to be AQP4-IgG-seronegative compared to those with established relapsing disease. A minority of patients with clinical characteristics of NMO, almost all AQP4-IgG-seronegative, have been reported to have detectable serum myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) antibodies and might have different characteristics (younger age, less frequently female, and less likely to relapse) from those with AQP4-IgG.e87 These findings might suggest that some AQP4-IgG-seronegative patients with clinical and neuroimaging features of NMOSD have a different underlying pathogenesis; the role of MOG or other antibodies in disease pathogenesis remains undetermined. e88 The IPND nomenclature is designed to allow incorporation of cases of NMOSD associated with other validated biomarkers (e.g. NMOSD with a specific autoantibody).

Occasionally, patients without detectable serum AQP4-IgG are later found to be seropositive. There may be technical explanations in some cases but antibody levels also increase with clinical relapses and decrease with immunosuppressive therapy in some patients. Therefore, retesting should be considered before B-cell or antibody-targeted therapies (plasma exchange, immunosuppressive drugs) are instituted and in seronegative patients who relapse. Cases of clinical NMO in which AQP4-IgG was detected in CSF, but not serum, have been reported but this appears to be rare.e89–e91 Routine CSF testing of AQP4-IgG-seronegative patients is not recommended but might be considered in selected seronegative cases, especially those with additional confounding serum autoantibodies that may lead to uninterpretable or false-positive assay results.

The Panel considered absence of CSF oligoclonal bands as supportive evidence for NMOSD (although they are sometimes transiently detectable at the time of an attack) and presence of bands a red flag, but sensitivity and specificity are modest. CSF pleocytosis > 50 leukocytes/μL (incidence approximately 35% in NMOSD) or the presence of neutrophils or eosinophils (either > 5/μL; incidence 44% and 10%, respectively, in attack-associated samples) are particularly useful in distinguishing NMOSD from MS. CSF glial fibrillary acidic protein also shows promise as a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker but is elevated only for days to weeks following an attack. e92, e93

Practical recommendations on imaging — MRI

MRI examinations are an essential part of the clinical workup for diagnosis and monitoring of NMOSD. The initial MRI serves as an important baseline examination and shall cover both the brain and the spinal cord. MRI is also essential for distinguishing NMOSD from other CNS conditions.

If available, (fat-suppressed) MRI of the orbits is highly recommended, since it allows more precise depiction of the optic nerve than routine brain MR imaging. It may be required in patients with negative or unknown serostatus if making a diagnosis of NMOSD depends on the presence of longitudinally extensive optic neuritis (LEON) or an optic nerve lesion involving the optic chiasm (see Box 2) and conventional brain MRI does not allow reliable assessment of lesion extension. Particular notice should be paid to lesion location and extension, the presence or absence of optic head swelling, perineural gadolinium (Gd) enhancement, chiasmal lesions, and lesions of the optic tracts. While NMOSD more often affects the posterior (intracranial) part of the optic nerve, lesions in MS and MOG-EM/MOGAD are more frequently located in the anterior portion. Swelling of the optic nerve disk/head on orbital MRI is typically seen in MOG-EM/MOGAD, may infrequently occur in AQP4-IgG-positive NMOSD, and is very rare in MS, which typically manifests with retrobulbar ON. LEON is frequent in both NMOSD and MOG-EM/MOGAD but typically absent in MS. The optic chiasm and, more rarely, the optic tracts (often bilaterally) may be affected as well in AQP4-IgG-positive NMOSD, whereas these structures are mostly spared in MS; according to recent data, chiasmal lesions are also not uncommon in MOG-EM/MOGAD and then often extend from the anterior part of the optic nerve to the chiasm. Simultaneous bilateral optic nerve involvement is rather infrequent at onset in AQP4-IgG-positive NMOSD (~ 15% in a European cohort) but may occur later in the disease course. It is more common in seronegative NMOSD and in MOG-EM/MOGAD and relatively rare in MS. Gd-enhanced imaging of the optic nerve is recommended for differential diagnostic purposes. Enhancement of the perineural optic nerve sheath strongly favors a diagnosis of MOG-EM/MOGAD over NMOSD or MS. Demonstration of optic nerve Gd enhancement may also facilitate the discrimination between true relapses and pseudorelapses (defined as worsening or re-occurrence of pre-existing neurological symptoms caused by systemic metabolic changes rather than immune-mediated mechanisms) by providing supportive information. Of note, recent studies found Gd-enhancing lesions of the optic nerve in 20–50% of inter-attack MRI scans, i.e. in asymptomatic patients. In one study, these lesions were mainly located to sites of previous ON attacks, whereas new asymptomatic lesions as detected by Gd-enhanced imaging at sites not previously affected were very rare. Asymptomatic lesions were significantly shorter in length (in mm) than attack-related lesions and were not associated with an increased risk for site-specific attacks in the following year in another study.

### Glial fibrillary acidic protein autoimmunity: a French cohort study [^114SS4Ax]. Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study Participants

We included all patients testing positive in the CSF for GFAPα immunoglobulin G (IgG) between May 2017 and April 2020 from the Reference Center for Rare Brain and Spinal Cord Inflammatory Diseases (MIRCEM) in Lyon, France, and at the French National Reference Center for Paraneoplastic Neurologic Syndromes in Lyon, France.

Data of interest were retrospectively collected from the treating physicians using a structured questionnaire. It included demographic data, past history of tumor, coexisting autoimmunity, and T-cell dysregulation conditions. We collected clinical data: prodromal symptoms were defined as concomitant (or preceding by less than 1 month) constitutional symptoms (fever, fatigue, malaise, weight loss, nausea or vomiting); acute and subacute onsets were gathered and defined by 3 months or less between symptom onset and peak of symptoms whereas progressive onset was defined by more than 3 months between symptom onset and peak of symptoms; neurologic features and intensive care unit admission were evaluated. Modified Rankin scale (mRS) score was employed at diagnosis and at last reported date for a minimal follow-up period of 6 months.

Serologic data collected comprised anti-GFAP-IgG testing in serum and coexisting neural autoantibodies. The presence of IgG onconeural autoantibodies was evaluated by IFA and CBA in serum and CSF. The presence of aquaporin-4 (AQP4) IgG and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) IgG was evaluated by CBA in serum. Natremia and C-reactive protein (CRP) values were assessed. Routine CSF analysis included total white cell counts (neutrophils or lymphocytes), protein level, glucose level, and number of oligoclonal bands in CSF at diagnosis. Brain and spinal cord MRIs were reviewed by one neurologist (A.G.-D.) and one neuroradiologist (R. A.). Other paraclinical data included EMG and ophthalmic examinations (visual acuity, ocular fundus, visual field, retinal nerve fiber layer thickness at optical coherence tomography) when performed. First-line and long-term immunotherapy were collected. To assess treatment outcome, significant response was defined as a decrease of at least 2 points on mRS or full recovery. Longitudinal evaluation of anti-GFAP status in the CSF and MRI follow-up were reported, when available. Finally, we compared clinical, paraclinical, and outcome data of our cohort to the main published cohorts of GFAP astrocytopathy.

### Simultaneous new onset of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder in identical twins [^115dZ8BV]. BMJ Neurology Open (2021). High credibility.

Case report

We describe identical twin sisters with no known family history of demyelinating disease, including neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD). Their mother and maternal grandmother have Leiden factor V mutation. They have no knowledge of their father's medical history.

Patient A is a 20-year-old right-handed African-American woman and the bigger of the twins. All of her developmental milestones were met. She has hypothyroidism since the age of 9 years, irritable bowel syndrome, vitamin D deficiency and factor V Leiden homozygous. Two weeks prior to her clinic visit, she developed an insidious onset of right eye pain with eye movement. Nine days later, she developed blurred vision in the right eye only. She denied diplopia, headaches, fever, COVID-19 exposure or any symptoms suggestive of viral infection.

Several hours prior to this clinical visit, she was evaluated by an ophthalmologist who felt the patient had acute right retrobulbar optic neuritis. Her neurological and physical examination was unremarkable. Her visual acuity was not assessed due to chemically dilated pupils.

MRI of the brain was obtained the next day and demonstrated right optic nerve enhancement at the level of the orbital apex and immediately proximal to the optic chiasm (figure 1A). The lumbar puncture was done the same day and was remarkable for an opening pressure of 39 cm of water. Closing pressure was 19 cm of water. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) studies were remarkable for positive NMO/aquaporin-4 (AQP4), titre 1:32 and a serum NMO/AQP4-IgG positive titre of 1:10 000. CSF IgG index was 0.56 (reference range < 0.85). CSF cultures were negative, including a negative Lyme test. ACE was 0.7 (reference range 0.0–2.5). No oligoclonal bands. No red and three white blood cells. She had normal protein and glucose. Cytology was normal. Metabolic work-up was normal.

A rare case of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder, suspected to be bacterial meningomyelitis as the initial manifestation, is reported. The patient presented with initial symptoms of meningomyelitis and fever. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis revealed pleocytosis (1280 × 10⁶/L [98% lymphocytes]) and glucose level of 1.8mmol/L. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed > 3 vertebral, longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis and area postrema lesions. Right optic neuritis was experienced 20 months after the first attack. Serum anti-aquaporin-4 antibody was positive, and a diagnosis of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder was made, supporting the hypothesis that the pathogenesis of neuromyelitis optica is triggered by infection.

The 2015 IPND diagnostic criteria for "NMOSD without AQP4-IgG" or "NMOSD with unknown AQP4-IgG serostatus" are based mainly on clinical and MRI features typically found in AQP4-IgG-positive NMO. This is useful in enabling a diagnosis of NMOSD also in patients with a false-negative AQP4-IgG test result and in AQP4-IgG-positive patients in whom AQP4-IgG testing has not yet been performed or who do not have access to AQP4-IgG testing. However, patients with genuinely negative AQP4-IgG serostatus may also meet these criteria, which renders the subgroup heterogenous. Revised criteria should thus stress the need for strictly distinguishing "NMOSD with unknown AQP4-IgG serostatus" and "NMOSD without AQP4-IgG" as different diagnostic categories and should define strategies aiming at identifying patients with potentially false-negative AQP4-IgG results who may be included in the latter category. Moreover, more studies addressing the pathogenesis of seronegative NMOSD and the question of potential pathogenetic, prognostic and/or therapeutic heterogeneity within that category are highly desirable. Demonstration of such heterogeneity might have important implications for nosology and future diagnostic criteria, as it might bring about a need for further diagnostic stratification. Most importantly, future diagnostic criteria for NMOSD should pay particular attention to improving the discrimination of NMOSD and MOG-EM/MOGAD, should explicitly exclude patients with MOG-EM/MOGAD from the category of "NMOSD without AQP4-IgG", and, accordingly, should make MOG-IgG testing mandatory before a diagnosis of "NMOSD without AQP4-IgG" can be assigned.

### Classification of neurological diseases using multi-dimensional CSF analysis [^113ERkmX]. Brain (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Inflammatory, degenerative, and vascular disorders of the CNS affect millions of people worldwide. Autoimmune neuroinflammatory CNS diseases comprise a large and heterogeneous spectrum of disorders; some diseases such as neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (NMOSD)and autoimmune encephalitis (AIE), are characterized by disease-specific (auto)antibodies, while others such as Susac syndromefeature alterations in the T cell compartment or alterations in both the adaptive and innate immune compartment, as in multiple sclerosis. Multiple sclerosis is the most prevalent autoimmune disease of the CNS. With 2.3 million people affected worldwide, multiple sclerosis is a paradigmatic example of a chronic neuroinflammatory disease, comprising typical features of CNS autoimmunity, including (i) a clinically heterogeneous disease course; (ii) continuous disease evolution over time; and (iii) putative pathophysiological heterogeneity within one disease (i.e. inflammatory versus neurodegenerative components).

CSF is an ultrafiltrate of the serum surrounding and protecting the CNS parenchyma. Since pathophysiological changes in the CNS are reflected in the CSF, its analysis, concomitant with radiological, (neuro-)physiological and neuropsychological examinations, facilitates the diagnosis of neurological diseases. However, CSF parameters such as total cell counts, lactate, glucose quotient, integrity of the blood–CSF barrier, total protein and intrathecal immunoglobulin (Ig) synthesis enable only a gross differentiation between infectious, autoimmune and degenerative CNS disorders. Whether multi-dimensional cellular peripheral blood and CSF characterization by flow cytometry can support a more fine-grained distinction between clinically similar disease entities remains unknown. By investigating patients with neuroinflammatory, degenerative, and vascular disorders (Fig. 1A), we identified distinct cellular parameters in the peripheral blood and CSF that can improve the classification of neurological diseases and provide insights into shared and distinct pathophysiological processes (Fig. 1B).

### Serum and CSF N-acetyl aspartate levels differ in multiple sclerosis and neuromyelitis optica [^116xebH5]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2011). Low credibility.

Background

The identification of biomarkers able to improve the differential diagnosis between multiple sclerosis (MS) and neuromyelitis optica (NMO) is challenging because of a different prognosis and response to treatment. Growing evidence indicates that brain and CSF N-acetyl aspartate (NAA) concentration is a useful marker for characterising different phases of axonal pathology in demyelinating diseases, and preliminary studies suggest that increased serum NAA levels may be a telltale sign of acute neuronal damage or defective NAA metabolism in oligodendrocytes.

Objective

To evaluate whether serum and CSF NAA concentration differs in patients with MS and NMO.

Design

Observational, multicentre, prospective, cross sectional study.

Methods

Serum samples were collected from 48 relapsing-remitting MS, 32 NMO and 76 age matched healthy controls. Coeval CSF samples were available for all MS and for 8/32 NMO patients. NAA was measured in serum and CSF by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry.

Results

MS patients showed higher serum and CSF NAA levels than NMO patients, and higher serum NAA levels than healthy controls (p < 0.001). High serum NAA values, exceeding the 95th percentile of serum NAA values in healthy controls, were found in 100% of patients with MS and in no patient with NMO. No differences in serum NAA levels were found between NMO and healthy controls. In MS, serum and CSF NAA levels correlated with disability score.

Conclusions

Determination of serum and CSF NAA levels may represent a suitable tool in the diagnostic laboratory workup to differentiate MS and NMO.

### Update on the diagnosis and treatment of neuromyelits optica spectrum disorders (NMOSD)-revised recommendations of the Neuromyelitis Optica Study Group (NEMOS). Part I: diagnosis and differential diagnosis [^115NjrZd]. Journal of Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Practical recommendation — CSF analysis

Analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is not formally required to make a diagnosis of NMOSD according to the current diagnostic criteria; however, we strongly recommend lumbar puncture in patients with suspected NMOSD, since CSF analysis can support a diagnosis of NMOSD and help to distinguish the disorder from MS and other differential diagnoses.

Basic CSF examination should include determining oligoclonal bands, CSF white cell counts (WCC), CSF WCC differentiation (cytology), CSF erythrocyte counts, CSF total protein levels, CSF L-lactate levels, and CSF and serum glucose levels. However, we recommend to assess also IgG, IgM, IgA and albumin CSF/serum ratios (in combination with Reiber's diagrams), IgG/IgM/IgA fractions, and, if available, the so-called measles, rubella, and zoster virus (MRZ) reaction. The use of Link's IgG index is discouraged due to limited specificity, especially in patients with moderate to severe blood‒CSF barrier dysfunction). While CSF-specific oligoclonal IgG bands are a diagnostic mainstay of MS (present in > 95% of continental European patients, lower frequency in Asian patients) and persist over time, irrespective of clinical disease activity, they are absent in the majority of patients with AQP4-IgG-positive NMOSD (present in around 25% at first LP in and in only ~20% of acute samples and 10% of remission samples in), AQP4-IgG-negative NMOSD (present in around 35% at first LP in), or MOG-EM/MOGAD (~ 10%) and may be present only transiently. CSF WCC ≥ 50/µl, CSF neutrophils (occasionally also eosinophils), and an albumin CSF/serum ratio (QAlb) > 12 × 10⁻³ are all atypical for MS but not uncommon in AQP4-IgG-positive NMOSD (WCC ≥ 50/µl in ~ 15%; neutrophils present in ~ 50%; and QAlb > 12 × 10⁻³ in ~ 30% of all patients with acute attacks and in as many as 50% of those with blood–CSF barrier dysfunction) and MOG-EM/MOGAD (WCC ≥ 50/µl in 46% with acute myelitis, but only very rarely during acute ON; neutrophils in ~ 60% during acute myelitis and ~ 25% during acute ON; QAlb > 12 × 10⁻³ in 24% of all patients and 43% of those with elevated QAlb during acute myelitis, but only rarely during acute ON). A positive MRZ reaction (as defined by a positive antibody index against at least two of these three viral antigens), which is present in ~ 67% of patients with MS and is considered the most specific laboratory marker of MS known so far, was absent in virtually all patients with AQP4-IgG-positive or -negative NMOSD tested so far (but also in those with MOG-EM/MOGAD). In contrast to MS, CSF L-lactate levels were mildly increased in an AQP4-IgG-positive NMOSD cohort (in ~ 45% during acute myelitis and ~ 20% during acute ON; 0% during remission; median 2.9 mmol/l during acute attacks, range 2.1–6.8, in a European cohort), similar to what is seen in MOG-EM/MOGAD (~ 25% in patients with acute myelitis, median 2.5 mmol/l, range 1.9–4.43, > 3 mmol/l in around 10%; rarely in acute ON). It is important to note (a) that the frequency and extent of CSF abnormalities, as detected by lumbar puncture, depends strongly on the lesion site (spinal cord > brain > optic nerve), reflecting both the rostrocaudal CSF gradient and lesion volume, and (b) that CSF findings may be normal, even during attacks, particularly often in patients with acute ON. AQP4-IgG (as well as MOG-IgG) is often detectable also in the CSF, but antibody indices are usually negative, indicating an extrathecal origin. As mentioned above, the current diagnostic criteria for NMOSD (as well as those for MOG-EM/MOGAD) require serum AQP4-IgG positivity; CSF AQP4-IgG positivity alone is currently not considered sufficient.

### Diagnostic features of initial demyelinating events associated with serum MOG-IgG [^11565dqL]. Journal of Neuroimmunology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)-IgG associated disorders are increasingly recognized as a distinct disease entity. However, diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of serum MOG-IgG as well as recommendations for testing are still debated.

Materials and Methods

Between October 2015 and July 2017 we tested serum MOG-IgG in 91 adult patients (49 females) with a demyelinating event (DE) not fulfilling 2010 McDonald criteria for MS at sampling, negative for neuromyelitis optica (NMO)-IgG and followed-up for at least 12 months. We assessed the sensitivity and specificity of a live-cell MOG-IgG assay for each final diagnosis at last follow-up, for the 2018 international recommendations for MOG-IgG testing, and for other combinations of clinical and laboratory characteristics.

Results

Clinical presentations included acute myelitis (n = 48), optic neuritis (n = 36), multifocal encephalomyelitis (n = 4), and brainstem syndrome (n = 3). Twenty-four patients were MOG-IgG positive. Sensitivity and specificity of MOG-IgG test applied to the 2018 international recommendations were 28.4% and 86.7%, while they were 42.1% and 88.6% when applied to DE of unclear aetiology as defined above with two or more among: 1_no periventricular and juxtacortical MS-like lesions on brain MRI; 2_longitudinally extensive MRI optic nerve lesion; 3_no CSF-restricted oligoclonal bands; 4_CSF protein > 50 mg/dl.

Conclusions

Simplified requirements compared to those currently proposed for MOG-IgG testing could facilitate the applicability of the assay in the diagnosis of adults with DEs of unclear aetiology.

### Chloride imbalance is involved in the pathogenesis of optic neuritis in neuromyelitis optica [^113emA15]. Journal of Neuroimmunology (2018). Low credibility.

Chloride imbalance between the serum and the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) has been recently shown to exist in the acute phase of neuromyelitis optica (NMO). In this report, we studied the relation between the quotient of chloride (Q Cl) and the severity of optic neuritis (ON) in NMO patients. There was a positive correlation (R = 0.67; p < 0.05) between Q Cl and the length of ON-lesion. The visual prognosis also showed a positive correlation with Q Cl in the acute phase (R = 0.58; p < 0.05). These results support the theory that chloride imbalance between serum and CSF may trigger the ON in NMO spectrum disorders.

Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) collected from lumbar puncture showed elevated protein count (0.79 g/L) but normal glucose (3.2 mmol/L) (table 1). CSF culture and blood cultures were negative. SARS-CoV-2 (PCR) from nasopharyngeal swab and CSF was not detected. Serology for SARS-CoV-2 demonstrated recent infection (SARS-CoV-2 IgG 640, SARS-CoV-2 IgA 160, SARS-CoV-2 IgM 20 by in-house immunofluorescent antibody testing). ACE levels were not detected in CSF. Antibodies for anti-myelin-associated glycoprotein IgM (ELISA), myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (in-house assay) and neuromyelitis optica IgG (Euroimmun immunofluoresence) were negative in serum. Serology for mycoplasma, Epstein–Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, HIV, hepatitis B and C was negative. An autoimmune panel did not suggest primary autoimmune condition. Serum ferritin (711 μ/L) and interleukin-6 levels (7.8 pg/mL) were only measured day 10 of admission (28 days after symptom onset) and showed elevated ferritin but normal interleukin-6 (IL-6) level.

### Cerebrospinal fluid: serum glucose ratio in the ventricular and lumbar compartments: implications for clinical practice [^113dWVND]. European Journal of Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Calculation of the cerebrospinal fluid:serum glucose (CSF:S G lu) ratio is part of the routine cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) work-up. Reference values have been defined for lumbar CSF, but are lacking for ventricular CSF. The objective of this study was to investigate whether the CSF:S G lu ratio is similar in lumbar and ventricular compartments, and to determine cut-off values for CSF:S G lu ratio in ventricular CSF.

Methods

We included CSF samples that were collected by either lumbar puncture or ventricular drainage, with a red blood cell count < 500/μL, normal white blood cell count and age-related normal total protein content, with simultaneously withdrawn serum sample and time to laboratory processing of ≤ 2 h. This resulted in 1808 sample pairs. Glucose concentrations in CSF and serum were measured by enzymatic spectrophotometry.

Results

The CSF:S G lu ratio was similar in ventricular and lumbar compartments after controlling for age, sex, time between sample withdrawal and laboratory processing, CSF white blood cell and red blood cell count, CSF total protein and serum glucose concentration using a multiple linear regression model. Lower limits for CSF:S G lu ratio in the ventricular compartment, defined as 5 th percentile, were 0.51 for patients with serum glucose concentration < 100 mg/dL, 0.45 for those with serum glucose concentration ≥ 100 mg/dL and < 150 mg/dL, and 0.36 for those with serum glucose concentration ≥ 150 mg/dL.

Conclusions

The CSF:S G lu ratio was similar in the ventricular and lumbar compartments, and depended mainly on time to laboratory processing and absolute serum glucose levels. Previously established lower limits for CSF:S G lu ratio in lumbar CSF can be also applied for ventricular CSF.

### Neuroimaging in patients with abnormal blood glucose levels [^114qhS1i]. AJNR: American Journal of Neuroradiology (2014). Low credibility.

Summary

Smooth neuronal functioning requires an uninterrupted supply of energy that is provided by glucose under normal physiologic conditions. Significant variations in plasma glucose levels, be it hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia, can present with myriad clinical manifestations and may mimic stroke. At times, the diagnosis is either not apparent or not clinically suspected. Imaging can suggest the diagnosis in unsuspected cases and can help in the assessment of the extent of neuronal damage in known cases, making it vital for the neuroradiologist to be aware of both common and atypical neuroimaging findings in hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia.

### Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders: still evolving and broadening [^116jiWWt]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

There have been some evidences that MOG-antibody is directly involved in the pathogenesis of MOG-antibody-associated disease, and pathological studies of brain-biopsied cases with MOG-antibody and CSF analyses of MOG-antibody-seropositive patients showed that MOG-antibody-associated disease is an inflammatory demyelinating disease but not an astrocytopathic disease even if the clinical phenotype is typical NMO (Table 1). This important finding has widened the pathological concept of NMOSD.

A subset of cases with typical NMO are seronegative for AQP4 and MOG antibodies. Some of them may be false-negative based on the currently available assays but it remains unclear whether a third NMO-associated autoantibody is present and this issue is under study.

### Investigating the presence of interattack astrocyte damage in neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder: longitudinal analysis of serum glial fibrillary acidic protein [^113uru8o]. Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) is a primary astrocytopathy mediated by antibodies against aquaporin-4 (AQP4), a water channel protein mainly expressed in astrocytes. Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) is a component of the astrocyte cytoskeleton, and its presence in bodily fluids is believed to reflect the extent of astrocyte damage. Having been shown the good correlation of GFAP levels between CSF and serum, serum GFAP (sGFAP) is considered as a potential biomarker for disease activity in individuals with NMOSD.

Clinical events in individuals with NMOSD can result in significant astrocyte damage; however, it is unclear whether astrocyte damage can occur in the absence of a clinical attack. Defining subclinical astrocyte damage may provide insights into NMOSD pathophysiology and lead to establishment of disease-monitoring strategies. This study addressed whether astrocyte damage can occur during interattack periods by longitudinally measuring sGFAP levels at multiple time points.

### Interleukin-6 in neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder pathophysiology [^113Hpw5r]. Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) is a rare autoimmune disorder that preferentially affects the spinal cord and optic nerve. Most patients with NMOSD experience severe relapses that lead to permanent neurologic disability; therefore, limiting frequency and severity of these attacks is the primary goal of disease management. Currently, patients are treated with immunosuppressants. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a pleiotropic cytokine that is significantly elevated in the serum and the CSF of patients with NMOSD. IL-6 may have multiple roles in NMOSD pathophysiology by promoting plasmablast survival, stimulating the production of antibodies against aquaporin-4, disrupting blood-brain barrier integrity and functionality, and enhancing proinflammatory T-lymphocyte differentiation and activation. Case series have shown decreased relapse rates following IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) blockade in patients with NMOSD, and 2 recent phase 3 randomized controlled trials confirmed that IL-6R inhibition reduces the risk of relapses in NMOSD. As such, inhibition of IL-6 activity represents a promising emerging therapy for the management of NMOSD manifestations. In this review, we summarize the role of IL-6 in the context of NMOSD.

### Cerebrospinal fluid [^113ssatm]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

A quick and accurate diagnosis of maladies affecting the central nervous system (CNS) is imperative. Procurement and analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) are paramount in helping the clinician determine a patient's clinical condition. Various staining methods, measurement of white blood cell counts, glucose and protein levels, recognition of xanthochromia, and microbiologic studies are CSF parameters that are collectively important in the ultimate determination by a clinician of the presence or absence of a catastrophic CNS condition. Many of these CNS parameters have significant limitations that should be recognized to minimize under treating patients with catastrophic illness.

Methods

Case report

Data were retrieved retrospectively from the patient's records. The patient gave written informed consent for publication.

Literature review

A PubMed search was performed using the following search term: ("MOG antibody disease" OR "MOG antibody-associated disease" OR "MOG antibody-associated disorder" OR "MOGAD" OR ("mog" AND ("encephalomyelitis" OR "IgG" OR "immunoglobulin g" OR "antibody" OR "antibodies" OR "autoantibody" OR "autoantibodies")) AND ("COVID-19" OR "COVID19" OR "SARS-CoV-2" OR "SARS-CoV2" OR "severe acute respiratory syndrome" OR "coronavirus")).

### The poor recovery of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder is associated with a lower level of CXCL12 in the human brain [^116hJMBi]. Journal of Neuroimmunology (2015). Low credibility.

Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (NMOSDs) are blindness-causing neuritis. In NMOSD patients, NMO-IgG evokes astrocytopathy that in turn causes demyelination. While measurement of NMO-IgG titer will help neurologists make the diagnosis of NMOSDs, it is not sufficient to evaluate the severity of astrocytopathy. In this study, we compared the different levels of an astrocyte biomarker in cerebrospinal fluid of NMOSD patients with good or poor recovery, and then linked their differences to the changes in remyelinating promoter (CXCL12) levels. Our results indicate that NMO-IgG down-regulated CXCL12 and impaired the remyelinating process, this may be a mechanism contributing to the poor recovery of NMOSDs.

### Granulocyte activation markers in cerebrospinal fluid differentiate acute neuromyelitis spectrum disorder from multiple sclerosis [^1123TKKg]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) and relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) share clinical and imaging characteristics, which can make it difficult to differentiate them, and hence may delay the initiation and the choice of adequate therapy. The detection of auto-antibodies targeting the astrocyte water channel anti-aquaporin-4 protein (aAQP4) has become a pivotal biomarker tool to diagnose NMOSD. However, 20%–40% of patients eventually fulfilling NMOSD criteria remain aAQP4 − which makes it even more difficult to establish the accurate diagnosis. Furthermore, the presence or the titre of aAQP4 is not related to clinical disease characteristics. Several biomarkers tend to be more highly elevated in NMOSD than in MS, for example, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and S100B (both markers of astrocyte damage), neurofilament light chain (NfL, a marker of neuroaxonal injury), chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 13 (CXCL13, a B-cell attractant), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and vascular cellular adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) (both leucocyte adhesion molecules)and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9, a matrix remodelling gelatinase). Yet, all lack the necessary diagnostic specificity due to overlapping concentration ranges in the two diseases, and the relation between levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or blood with clinical severity remains uncertain.

### Pleocytosis is not fully responsible for low CSF glucose in meningitis [^114pm8ah]. Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

The aim of this cross-sectional study was to evaluate the relative contribution of CSF inflammation vs microbial infection in driving hypoglycorrhachia in the clinical context of microbial and aseptic meningitis. We made the hypothesis that because all leukocytes (neutrophils, lymphocytes, or monocytes) have the capability of catabolizing glucose, they could be a major determinant of hypoglycorrhachia, including in aseptic meningitis. We retrospectively collected meningitis CSF profiles — defined as the presence of pleocytosis — with confirmed microbial and aseptic etiologies. This dichotomization offered a natural experiment to compare CSF glucose levels along a continuum of varying degrees of CNS inflammation in the presence (microbial) or the absence (aseptic) of microorganisms capable of catabolizing glucose across a broad range of meningitis etiologies.

### Newly emerging type B insulin resistance (TBIR) during treatment with eculizumab for AQP4-IgG-positive neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD): fatal outcome [^115Aa7Xo]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Dear Sirs,

Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (NMOSD) are rare yet often severe autoimmune neurological diseases causing predominantly myelitis and optic neuritis. NMOSD can result in permanent para-/tetraplegia or blindness, with women predominantly affected. Immunoglobulin G (IgG) autoantibodies against the water channel protein aquaporin-4 (AQP4), first described in 2004, contribute directly to the pathogenesis of NMOSD. For many years, maintenance treatment of NMOSD relied on classic immunosuppression with drugs such as corticosteroids, azathioprine, and mycophenolate mofetil, or on B-cell depletion with rituximab, all used off-label. Recently, however, treatment with the complement component C5 antibody eculizumab, which inhibits the late stage of the complement cascade, has been approved. In 2019, a randomized controlled study showed a significantly lower risk of relapse in NMOSD patients treated with eculizumab than in those who received placebo.

Here, we describe the case of an eculizumab-treated patient who developed fatal infectious complications following the emergence of an autoimmune glucose metabolism disorder. This patient was diagnosed with AQP4-IgG-positive NMOSD according to the 2015 International Panel for NMO Diagnosis criteria at the age of 16 years after an attack of unilateral optic neuritis followed 5 months later by an episode of brainstem encephalitis and myelitis. AQP4-IgG was detected by means of a cell-based assay (maximum titer 1:10,000), and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein-antibody associated encephalomyelitis was excluded. Despite treatment with a variety of disease-modifying drugs, including intravenous immunoglobulins, azathioprine (AZA), mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), and rituximab (RTX), the patient experienced at least six more episodes of myelitis over the following 4 years, leaving her unable to walk. The course of disease was complicated by multiple infections, including sepsis with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and upper respiratory tract infection with Haemophilus influenzae during treatment with MMF. Despite laboratory evidence of full B-cell depletion during treatment with RTX, the patient experienced three further episodes of myelitis, including a particularly severe attack of brainstem encephalitis and longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis extending from the medulla oblongata to the conus, leading to paresis of both arms in addition to the existing paraparesis.

### CSF levels of glutamine synthetase and GFAP to explore astrocytic damage in seronegative NMOSD [^114Lr1FM]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To explore levels of astrocytopathy in neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) by measuring levels of the astrocytic enzyme glutamine synthetase (GS) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), an established astrocytic biomarker known to be associated with disease activity in multiple sclerosis.

Methods

Cerebrospinal fluid concentrations of GS and GFAP were measured by ELISA in patients with NMOSD (n = 39, 28 aquaporin-4 (AQP4)-Ab-seropositive, 3 double-Ab-seronegative, 4 myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)-Ab-seropositive and 4 AQP4-Ab-seronegative with unknown MOG-Ab-serostatus), multiple sclerosis (MS) (n = 69), optic neuritis (n = 5) and non-neurological controls (n = 37).

Results

GFAP and GS concentrations differed significantly across groups (both p < 0.001), showing a similar pattern of elevation in patients with AQP4-Ab-seropositive NMOSD. GS and GFAP were significantly correlated, particularly in patients with AQP4-Ab-seropositive NMOSD (r s = 0.70, p < 0.001). Interestingly, GFAP levels in some patients with double-Ab-seronegative NMOSD were markedly increased.

Conclusions

Our data indicate astrocytic injury occurs in some patients with double-Ab-seronegative NMOSD, which hints at the possible existence of yet undiscovered astrocytic autoimmune targets. We hypothesise that elevated GS and GFAP levels could identify those double-Ab-seronegative patients suitable to undergo in-depth autoimmune screening for astrocytic antibodies.

CSF Analysis

CSF was available in 424 patients (42.4%; Table 2). An elevated protein was found in 68.4% of cases (median 57 mg/dL; IQR [39–75]; reference range > 50 mg/dL), whereas 221 patients (52.1%) had an elevated white blood cell count (median 3 white blood cells; IQR [1–12]; reference range > 5 white blood cells/mL). Unique CSF oligoclonal bands (reference ≥ 2 unique bands) were found in 109 patients (25.6%), and 59 (54.1%) of those patients had a final diagnosis of MS. A total of 35 patients with LETM (36%) had oligoclonal bands.

Table 2
CSF Results

In our logistic model, a CSF pleocytosis was significantly associated with increased odds of LETM (OR = 1.01, 95% CI [1.001–1.018]), whereas oligoclonal bands were marginally associated with a decrease in odds of LETM (OR = 0.57, 95% CI [0.32–1.01]). Elevated protein (OR = 1.01, 95% CI [1.002–1.012]) and elevated glucose (OR = 1.01, 95% CI [1.002–1.023]) were associated with worsening mRS score outcomes.

### The real-world applicability of the 2023 international myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody-associated disease criteria in a latin American cohort [^114jfk72]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody (MOG‐IgG)‐associated disease (MOGAD) is a rare and recently defined demyelinating disorder of the central nervous system (CNS), characterized by relapses of optic neuritis (ON), transverse myelitis (TM), and brainstem/brain impairment with a rapidly evolving clinical spectrum. Currently, a significant overlap of clinical and neuroradiological findings with aquaporin‐4 antibody (AQP4‐IgG) neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) and multiple sclerosis (MS) are commonly observed in clinical practice. However, MOGAD is considered a different entity from AQP4‐IgG NMOSD and MS. Recently, this disease‐specific antibody that binds MOG has been identified based on new generation cell‐based assays (CBAs), leading initially (in 2018) to the publication of two "not formal" sets of criteria based on MOGAD international recommendations for diagnosis and antibody testing and a single referral center (Mayo Clinic). Most recently, the definition and classification of MOGAD was published by an international panel of experts who described the 2023 proposed diagnostic criteria for this entity. This International MOGAD Panel has highlighted three main points to reach diagnosis: (i) core clinical demyelinating events and supporting clinical or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features, (ii) MOG‐IgG and their titers, and (iii) exclusion of alternative diagnoses. Thus, the 2023 diagnostic criteria have emphasized the serostatus and clinical implications of MOG‐IgG plus typical or suggestive MRI lesions, reflecting broader MOGAD phenotypes, to facilitate earlier and more accurate diagnosis. Notably, if MOG‐IgG titers are low‐positive or positive without reported titer or negative but with clearly positive cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) MOG‐IgG, supporting clinical or MRI criteria must be met to establish an MOGAD diagnosis. It is important to notice that the availability for MOG‐IgG testing has been reported to be < 42% in lower income or lower resource countries like Latin American (LATAM) countries. Thus, the access to MOGAD care and cost of recommended assays (including antibody titers) are a limitation in fulfilling diagnostic criteria, leading to evident challenges in achieving an early, accurate, and definitive diagnosis in this population. This issue is well recognized, as patients may exhibit clinical and imaging features consistent with MOGAD but may not have detectable MOG‐IgG or they may live in countries where reliable MOG‐IgG testing is unavailable.

### EFNS guidelines on diagnosis and management of neuromyelitis optica [^116yRtxS]. European Journal of Neurology (2010). Medium credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder, more specifically with respect to diagnosis, EFNS 2010 guidelines recommend to recognize that:

- the predominant course of neuromyelitis optica is characterized by recurrent severe attacks of myelitis and/or uni- or bilateral optic neuritis with incomplete recovery and is up to 10 times more prevalent in women than in men

- age of onset, the late 30s, is approximately 10 years later than the age of onset in multiple sclerosis, but neuromyelitis optica may also occur in children and elderly people

- optic neuritis with severe visual loss and in rapid succession may be indicative of neuromyelitis optica

- optic atrophy is more pronounced than in multiple sclerosis and may form cavitation

- complete transverse myelitis is typical for neuromyelitis optica, and partial transverse myelitis syndromes are more indicative of multiple sclerosis

- expansion of the spinal cord lesion may lead to brainstem symptoms and life-threatening complications.

### Update on the diagnosis and treatment of neuromyelits optica spectrum disorders (NMOSD)-revised recommendations of the Neuromyelitis Optica Study Group (NEMOS). Part I: diagnosis and differential diagnosis [^115B4CDq]. Journal of Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

How should NMOSD be diagnosed?

The initial workup in patients with suspected NMOSD must include a detailed medical history and an extended physical and neurological examination. Additional mandatory diagnostic tests include cranial and spinal MRI and serum AQP4-IgG antibody testing. Orbital MRI may be required in selected patients (see section on MRI diagnostics for details). Lumbar puncture is highly recommended for differential diagnostic purposes. Optionally, OCT may be performed and evoked potentials assessed. Fig. 1 shows a proposed diagnostic algorithm.

Fig. 1
Proposed algorithm for the diagnosis of NMOSD. AQP4-IgG aquaporin-4 immunoglobulin G antibodies, CSF cerebrospinal fluid, MOG-EM/MOGAD myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) antibody-associated encephalomyelitis/MOG autoantibody-associated disease, MRI magnetic resonance imaging, OCT optic coherence tomography

We strongly recommend that NMOSD be diagnosed according to the revised diagnostic criteria proposed by the International Panel for NMO Diagnosis (IPND) in 2015. These criteria take into account clinical and MRI findings and the AQP4-IgG serostatus and allow NMOSD to be diagnosed after only a single clinical event. Use of the 2006 criteria is strictly discouraged, since it may result in significant underreporting of NMOSD. The 1999 criteria did not yet take into account AQP4-IgG serostatus and must not be used.

In patients with a positive AQP4-IgG serostatus, at least one of the six core characteristics listed in Box 1 must be present before a diagnosis of definite NMOSD can be made (note that the definition of core characteristics 5 and 6 includes not only clinical but also MRI findings), and alternative diagnoses that might better explain the patient's symptoms must be excluded. This is different from previous criteria, which required a history of both acute ON and acute myelitis.

### EFNS guidelines on diagnosis and management of neuromyelitis optica [^115WTx36]. European Journal of Neurology (2010). Medium credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder, more specifically with respect to management of relapse, EFNS 2010 guidelines recommend to consider administering high-dose corticosteroids (methylprednisolone 1 g for 3–5 consecutive days) as first-line therapy, followed by an oral prednisolone taper, for the treatment of relapses.

### "Lupus myelitis" revisited: a retrospective single-center study of myelitis associated with rheumatologic disease [^117HMUVv]. Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Our study builds on existing "lupus myelitis" literature, which mostly predates the contemporary AQP4-IgG and MOG-IgG testing context and based on case series/case reports. In one of the largest and relatively recent retrospective studies in 2009, the investigators reported findings from 22 patients with SLE and myelitis, dividing the cohort into 11 patients with "gray matter findings" and 11 with "white matter findings", a distinction that was made based on clinical examination at presentation (i.e. flaccidity and hyporeflexia vs spasticity and hyperreflexia), rather than by imaging. They hypothesized that "gray matter" myelitis and "white matter" myelitis were distinct syndromes with different underlying pathomechanisms, with patients with "gray matter" myelitis having a more acute, treatment-refractory course with higher rates of CSF pleocytosis, lower CSF glucose, and lower rates of contrast enhancement on spine MRI. However, MOG-IgG testing was not available at the time of this 2009 studyand AQP4-IgG testing was limited with 15 of 22 patients having documented AQP4-IgG assays. All AQP4-IgG testing in the preceding study was undertaken with tissue indirect immunofluorescence assays, which are less sensitive than both ELISA and CBA. Furthermore, AQP4-IgG seropositive patients were present in both groups (1 with "gray matter" myelitis and 4 with "white matter" myelitis), supporting that this purely syndromic definition of SLE-related myelitis is unlikely to reflect discrepant pathophysiologic underpinnings in the 2 clinically defined groups (i.e. "gray matter" and "white matter" myelitis). Owing to different diagnostic groups, CSF findings in our study are difficult to compare with those of the 2009 study summarized above. While a higher CSF WBC count and a greater proportion with low CSF glucose in the "double-seronegative" group were seen in our study, these findings were not statistically significant. Analyses were limited because of small sample size and since not all patients underwent CSF analysis in the acute phase. Based on the high proportion of patients in our study found to have a diagnosis of AQP4-IgG seropositive NMOSD or MOGAD, and that MOGAD can account for a substantial proportion of patients with pure spinal cord gray matter involvement on MRI, we view the "gray matter" vs "white matter" myelitis distinction as insufficient for use in contemporary clinical practice. There is an urgent need to update our definition of myelitis in the context of lupus and other rheumatologic diseases now that we have entered an era of defining neurologic diagnoses based on specific biomarkers (e.g. AQP4-IgG in NMOSD), which identify patients with unique prognoses, monitoring, and treatment requirements.

### Neurological update: MOG antibody disease [^116KCuUp]. Journal of Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) antibody disease (MOG-AD) is now recognised as a nosological entity with specific clinical and paraclinical features to aid early diagnosis. Although no age group is exempt, median age of onset is within the fourth decade of life, with optic neuritis being the most frequent presenting phenotype. Disease course can be either monophasic or relapsing, with subsequent relapses most commonly involving the optic nerve. Residual disability develops in 50–80% of patients, with transverse myelitis at onset being the most significant predictor of long-term outcome. Recent advances in MOG antibody testing offer improved sensitivity and specificity. To avoid misdiagnosis, MOG antibody testing should be undertaken in selected cases presenting clinical and paraclinical features that are felt to be in keeping with MOG-AD, using a validated cell-based assay. MRI characteristics can help in differentiating MOG-AD from other neuroinflammatory disorders, including multiple sclerosis and neuromyelitis optica. Cerebrospinal fluid oligoclonal bands are uncommon. Randomised control trials are limited, but observational open-label experience suggests a role for high-dose steroids and plasma exchange in the treatment of acute attacks, and for immunosuppressive therapies, such as steroids, oral immunosuppressants and rituximab as maintenance treatment.

### Cerebrospinal fluid ceramides from patients with multiple sclerosis impair neuronal bioenergetics [^113FFWtM]. Brain (2014). Low credibility.

Axonal damage is a prominent cause of disability and yet its pathogenesis is incompletely understood. Using a xenogeneic system, here we define the bioenergetic changes induced in rat neurons by exposure to cerebrospinal fluid samples from patients with multiple sclerosis compared to control subjects. A first discovery cohort of cerebrospinal fluid from 13 patients with multiple sclerosis and 10 control subjects showed that acute exposure to cerebrospinal fluid from patients with multiple sclerosis induced oxidative stress and decreased expression of neuroprotective genes, while increasing expression of genes involved in lipid signalling and in the response to oxidative stress. Protracted exposure of neurons to stress led to neurotoxicity and bioenergetics failure after cerebrospinal fluid exposure and positively correlated with the levels of neurofilament light chain. These findings were validated using a second independent cohort of cerebrospinal fluid samples (eight patients with multiple sclerosis and eight control subjects), collected at a different centre. The toxic effect of cerebrospinal fluid on neurons was not attributable to differences in IgG content, glucose, lactate or glutamate levels or differences in cytokine levels. A lipidomic profiling approach led to the identification of increased levels of ceramide C16:0 and C24:0 in the cerebrospinal fluid from patients with multiple sclerosis. Exposure of cultured neurons to micelles composed of these ceramide species was sufficient to recapitulate the bioenergetic dysfunction and oxidative damage induced by exposure to cerebrospinal fluid from patients with multiple sclerosis. Therefore, our data suggest that C16:0 and C24:0 ceramides are enriched in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with multiple sclerosis and are sufficient to induce neuronal mitochondrial dysfunction and axonal damage.

### EFNS guidelines on diagnosis and management of neuromyelitis optica [^112UQVSw]. European Journal of Neurology (2010). Medium credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder, more specifically with respect to AQP-4 antibodies, EFNS 2010 guidelines recommend to obtain testing for serum neuromyelitis optica-IgG/AQP-4 antibodies in the evaluation of neuromyelitis optica and NMOSDs.

### Update on the diagnosis and treatment of neuromyelits optica spectrum disorders (NMOSD)-revised recommendations of the Neuromyelitis Optica Study Group (NEMOS). Part I: diagnosis and differential diagnosis [^112e5H2G]. Journal of Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

The timing of antibody testing is important, since procedures given for attack treatment (glucocorticosteroids, plasma exchange [PLEX], immunoadsorption [IA]), immunosuppressants, intravenous immunoglobulins) or attack prevention may rarely cause false-negative or ambiguous results. Therefore, samples for antibody testing should ideally be taken before treatment is commenced. As AQP4-IgG and MOG-IgG are produced mainly extrathecally, serum should be used for AQP4-IgG determination as biomaterial of choice.

Testing of CSF for AQP4-IgG or MOG-IgG may theoretically be helpful in the very rare cases in which non-specific, coexisting serum antibodies cause a strong background signal that may potentially mask a weak AQP4-IgG- or MOG-IgG-specific signal or if testing is performed shortly after PLEX or IA. In fact, a few reports exist on patients positive for AQP4-IgG or MOG-IgG only in the CSF but not in serum. In most of these cases, however, the results were not independently confirmed and/or no sufficiently large control cohorts were included, so the data remain controversial. Importantly, the current diagnostic criteria recommend the use of serum assays. If, deviating from this recommendation, in rare selected cases a provisional diagnosis is made after consultation with a specialized center based on CSF-only positivity, retesting of the CSF and serum sample in a methodologically different assay as well as confirmatory testing of follow-up serum samples is highly advisable.

The specimen analyzed (serum, CSF), the assay type (e.g. live CBA, fixed CBA, ELISA, tissue-based assay) and the assay manufacturer or performing laboratory, as well as the test result (positive, negative, grey area) and, if available, the titer and cut-off, should be documented in the discharge letter (e.g. "Serum AQP4-IgG positive (12-Sept-2022; titer 1:320, cut-off ≥ 1:10; fixed cell-based assay [Euroimmun])". In addition, the disease status (acute attack, remission) and treatment status at the time of testing should be documented, especially in the event of a negative test result, since samples obtained during remission or under treatment may occasionally be falsely negative or unequivocal and warrant retesting, as mentioned above.

Conclusion

CPM is a potential complication of uncontrolled diabetes mellitus in the absence of sodium abnormalities, and MRI examination is needed to provide early clues for the diagnosis and timely treatment of this disease. Control of blood glucose should be emphasized in patients with diabetes mellitus to prevent the development of CPM.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder, more specifically with respect to pretreatment evaluation, EULAR 2023 guidelines recommend to screen for latent tuberculosis before initiating biological or targeted synthetic DMARDs. Consider screening for latent tuberculosis before initiating conventional synthetic DMARDs, immunosuppressants, and/or corticosteroids (according to dose and duration) in patients at increased risk for latent tuberculosis. Follow national and/or international guidelines for screening latent tuberculosis, including a CXR and IGRA over tuberculin skin test where available.

### A 42-year-old woman with rapidly expanding white matter lesions: from the national multiple sclerosis society case conference proceedings [^115GQid1]. Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Testing was negative for syphilis, Lyme, tuberculosis, and JC virus antibody. Serologies were also negative for antinuclear antibody, double-stranded DNA antibody, Smith antibody, Ro antibody, La antibody, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody, aquaporin-4 antibody, and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody, and very long-chain fatty acid levels were normal. Serum autoimmune encephalopathy panel was negative. CSF testing showed lymphocytic pleocytosis (39 WBC/mm³, 95% lymph), normal red cell counts, elevated CSF protein at 61 mg/dL, and 52 mg/dL of glucose. CSF Gram stain and culture were negative, as were viral studies (HIV, enterovirus, CMV, EBV, and VZV by PCR and West Nile IgG/IgM). CSF MBP was > 160 ng/mL (normal level: < 4 ng/mL) and 4 CSF-specific oligoclonal bands were detected.

Other imagings, including MRI of orbits and spine, CT of the chest, abdomen and pelvis, along with CT angiogram of the head, were unremarkable. MR spectroscopy of the brain was nonspecific, showing slightly increased choline and lactate peaks with slightly decreased N-acetyl acetate peak. Flow cytometry and cytology showed no malignant cells.

Her hospital course (Figure 2) was complicated by new-onset seizure on hospital day 7. She received 1 g of IV methylprednisolone daily for 5 days between hospital days 11 and 15, after which she had subjective, but not objective, improvement. A repeat brain MRI on hospital day 13 showed progression with a new enhancing T2/FLAIR hyperintense lesion in the left frontal periventricular region. The right parietofrontal lobe lesion had enlarged, and the left parietofrontal lesion had extended into the left temporal lobe (Figure 1B). Based on these findings, an additional 5-day course of 1 g of IV methylprednisolone was given starting on hospital day 17, followed by plasma exchange.

### Clinical characteristics of patients with neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders with early onset [^116NNnJW]. Journal of Child Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder is a severe and disabling disease that manifests with severe relapses of optic neuritis, longitudinally extensive myelitis, and/or brainstem syndromes. The disease is complex and, although onset typically occurs in middle age, children and adolescents may be affected. The present study adds to the literature through detailed clinical data from 36 Brazilian patients with neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder starting before age 21. This was a retrospective assessment of medical records from 14 specialized units in Brazil. The results showed that the course of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder was worse in patients with disease onset before the age of 12 years. Gender and ethnic background did not influence disability accumulation. Over a median period of 8 years, 14% of the patients who presented the initial symptoms of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder before the age of 21 years died. In conclusion, the present study adds to the reports from other authors examining the severity of early-onset neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder.

What other biomarkers are of interest? New developments

Pathophysiologically, AQP4-IgG-positive NMOSD is characterized by direct damage of astrocytes induced by antibodies against the water channel protein AQP4 and secondary damage to oligodendrocytes and neurons, leading to demyelination and axonal loss. Biomarkers for astrocytic damage and neuroaxonal degeneration may thus potentially be of diagnostic and differential diagnostic impact. Neurofilament light chain (NfL), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), chitinase 3-like 1 protein (CHI3L1), and glutamine synthetase (GS) have all been found to be increased in the CSF of AQP4-IgG-positive NMOSD patients (and NfL and GFAP also in the serum), especially during acute attacks. Elevated CSF GFAP levels have been occasionally observed also in AQP4-IgG-negative patients). Similarly, elevated CSF levels of the neutrophil-related chemokines CXCL1, CXCL5, and CXCL7, the B-cell chemoattractant CXCL13, the T-cell activation marker soluble CD27 (sCD27), and the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6), a key mediator of the immune response in AQP4-IgG-positive NMOSD, have been described. Finally, a role for autoantibodies to glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) in the pathogenesis of blood–brain barrier breakdown in both AQP4-IgG-positive NMOSD and MOG-EM/MOGAD has been suggested. However, none of these markers is yet part of the standard diagnostic workup of patients with suspected NMOSD, and we recommend (in the absence of gold standard assays and/or generally accepted cut-offs) that these markers should currently be used mainly in the context of scientific studies.

### Meningitis in adult patients with a negative direct cerebrospinal fluid examination: value of cytochemical markers for differential diagnosis [^112EY6Z4]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Low CSF glucose levels (2 to 2.5 mmol/L) and a low CSF/serum glucose ratio (on the order of 0.30 to 0.40) have been classically described as a feature of BM. Spanos reported a median CSF glucose level of 3.4 mmol/L (CSF/serum glucose ratio, 0.45) in patients with BM and a negative direct examination of the CSF, compared with 1.7 mmol/L (CSF/serum glucose ratio, 0.23) in 134 patients with BM and a positive direct CSF examination. Similar values were seen in the patients included in our study, although CSF glucose levels were more markedly reduced.

Elevated CSF protein levels are also seen in patients with BM, mean values ranging from 1 to 2.5 g/L. With regard to the differential diagnosis of BM, the reported sensitivity of this parameter ranged from 63% to 86% with a specificity of 94% to 98%. Normal CSF protein values were found in 10% of patients with BM and a negative direct CSF examination. In our study, a CSF protein level of 1.88 g/L gave a sensitivity of 89% and a specificity of 93% for the diagnosis of BM. Normal levels of protein in the CSF were seen in 5% of the patients with BM in our study.

Lab tests

Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) findings: Three patients had normal cerebrospinal fluid pressure, while the other two were presented with elevated pressure (reference range: 80–180 mmHg). High white blood cells count (reference range: 0–10 × 10 6 /L), predominantly lymphocytes, was observed in five patients. Elevated CSF protein levels with values > 1.0 g/L (reference range: 0.15–0.45 g/L) were observed in all five cases. The CSF/blood glucose ratio < 0.5 was observed in all five cases, and in three cases, the absolute CSF glucose level (reference range: 2.5–4.4 mmol/L) was reduced. All five patients had reduced CSF chloride levels (reference range: 120–130 mmol/L), while one patient had elevated adenosine dehydrogenase (ADA) (reference range: 0–4 U/L). CSF immunoglobulin studies revealed that coxsackie virus IgM and human herpesvirus IgM were positive in one case, respectively. All five patients were negative for CSF mycobacterium tuberculosis smears, CSF mycobacterium tuberculosis cultures, CSF mycobacterium tuberculosis antibodies, CSF bacteriological culture, and CSF fungal culture (Table 2).
Blood serum tests: Among the patients included, three had hyponatremia (reference range: 137–147 mmol/L) and hypochlorhydria (reference range: 99–110 mmol/L, Table 2).
Antibody test: Positive GFAP serum and CSF antibodies were observed in three cases, while in the remaining two cases, it was only positive in CSF. Weakly positive anti-amphiphysin, anti-SSA, and anti-Ro-52 antibodies were detected in the pooled serum of one patient. Both serum and CSF were negative for MOG and AQP4 antibodies in all five cases.
Other tests: The tuberculosis diagnostic tests, i.e. T-spot and PPD skin test, were negative for all patients. Pulmonary CT, HIV, serum Treponema pallidum hemagglutination test (TPHA), serum tumor marker, and thyroid function tests did not reveal any abnormalities.

### Marked increase in cerebrospinal fluid glial fibrillar acidic protein in neuromyelitis optica: an astrocytic damage marker [^114PyhBU]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Neuromyelitis optica (NMO) is a neurological inflammatory disease associated with autoimmunity to aquaporin 4, predominantly localised in astrocytic foot processes. Recent studies have revealed that loss of aquaporin 4 and glial fibrillar acidic protein (GFAP) is a prominent feature of NMO lesions, suggesting astrocytic impairment.

Objective

To reveal a useful clinical biomarker of NMO.

Methods

Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were carried out for astrocytic markers GFAP and S100B in CSFs, obtained from the patients with NMO (n = 10) and multiple sclerosis (MS) (n = 10) manifesting acute myelitis, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) (n = 3), spinal infarction (n = 3), and other neurological diseases (OND) (n = 5).

Results

The CSF-GFAP levels during relapse in NMO (7666.0 (SD 15 266.5) ng/ml) were significantly over several thousand times higher than those in MS (0.7 (1.5)) or OND (0.6 (0.3)), and considerably higher than those in spinal infarction (354.7 (459.0)) and ADEM (0.4 (0.2)). They returned close to normal levels along with clinical improvement soon after corticosteroid therapy in NMO. There were strong correlations between the CSF-GFAP or S100B levels and expanded disability status scales or spinal lesion length in NMO (r > 0.9).

Conclusions

CSF-GFAP and S100B may be clinically useful biomarkers in NMO, and astrocytic damage is strongly suggested in the acute phase of NMO.

### Low myo-inositol indicating astrocytic damage in a case series of neuromyelitis optica [^116fMyoN]. Annals of Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

Astrocytic necrosis is a prominent pathological feature of neuromyelitis optica (NMO) lesions and is clinically relevant. We report 5 NMO-related cases, all with longitudinally extensive lesions in the upper cervical cord, who underwent cervical cord (1) H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Lower myo-inositol/creatine values, suggesting astrocytic damage, were consistently found within the NMO lesions when compared with healthy controls and patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), who showed at least 1 demyelinating lesion at the same cord level. Therefore, the in vivo quantification of myo-inositol may distinguish NMO from MS. This is an important step toward developing imaging markers for clinical trials in NMO.

### Predictors of relapse and disability in NMOSD, MOGAD, and double-seronegative demyelinating syndromes: an international multicenter retrospective cohort study [^113L543t]. Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

This international multicenter retrospective cohort study investigated predictors of relapse, acute attack severity, and six-month disability in patients with AQP4-IgG-positive NMOSD, MOGAD, and double-seronegative demyelinating syndromes.

Methods

We analyzed 238 patients (132 NMOSD, 69 MOGAD, 37 double-seronegative). Clinical features, CSF findings, and timing of acute and maintenance therapies were evaluated as prognostic markers.

Results

In NMOSD, female sex, delayed initiation of acute therapy, need for plasma exchange, and inflammatory CSF changes were associated with greater disability at the nadir of the first attack. Older age and longer disease duration predicted higher six-month disability, while oral corticosteroid tapering was protective. Higher EDSS at onset was associated with poorer six-month recovery. No factor significantly predicted relapse. In MOGAD, optic neuritis at onset and early IVMP were associated with lower six-month disability and higher recovery rates, whereas post-IVMP corticosteroid tapering correlated with higher six-month disability. CSF pleocytosis correlated with favorable recovery. Higher EDSS at onset predicted worse six-month outcomes. Early initiation of maintenance therapy reduced relapse risk although overall use versus none was not statistically conclusive. In double-seronegative patients, short steroid tapers, elevated CSF glucose, antecedent infections or vaccinations, and delayed maintenance therapy were associated with worse six-month recovery though no independent predictors were confirmed in multivariable analyses.

Conclusions

Prognostic factors differed across subgroups. NMOSD outcomes were influenced by age, disease duration, and steroid tapering; MOGAD outcomes by onset phenotype, early therapy, and maintenance treatment; and seronegative outcomes by treatment timing and immune antecedents. These findings emphasize early, tailored therapy and distinct subgroup-specific prognostic considerations in antibody-mediated and seronegative demyelinating disorders.

### Evaluation of distal symmetric polyneuropathy: the role of laboratory and genetic testing (an evidence-based review) [^113RFP41]. Muscle & Nerve (2009). Medium credibility.

Distal symmetric polyneuropathy (DSP) — screening laboratory testing yield and indicated tests: The cause of most polyneuropathies is evident when history, examination, electrodiagnostic (EDX) studies, and simple screening laboratory tests are combined, producing an etiological diagnosis in 74%–82% of patients with polyneuropathy, whereas laboratory tests alone had only a 37% diagnostic yield in idiopathic cases and in another study abnormalities were found in 58% of 91 patients but only 9% were etiologically diagnostic. Screening panels comprising complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, comprehensive metabolic panel (blood glucose, renal function, liver function), thyroid function tests, serum B12, and serum protein immunofixation electrophoresis are indicated for most patients, with the highest yield from blood glucose, serum B12, and serum protein immunofixation electrophoresis; in DSP cohorts blood glucose was elevated in ~11%, serum protein electrophoresis or immunofixation in 9%, and serum B12 low in ~3.6%. Routine cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis had a low diagnostic yield except in demyelinating polyneuropathies, which usually showed increased CSF protein.

### Multiple sclerosis followed by neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder: from the national multiple sclerosis society case conference proceedings [^116pGxuK]. Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

A woman presented at age 18 years with partial myelitis and diplopia and experienced multiple subsequent relapses. Her MRI demonstrated T2 abnormalities characteristic of multiple sclerosis (MS) (white matter ovoid lesions and Dawson fingers), and CSF demonstrated an elevated IgG index and oligoclonal bands restricted to the CSF. Diagnosed with clinically definite relapsing-remitting MS, she was treated with various MS disease-modifying therapies and eventually began experiencing secondary progression. At age 57 years, she developed an acute longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis and was found to have AQP4 antibodies by cell-based assay. Our analysis of the clinical course, radiographic findings, molecular diagnostic methods, and treatment response characteristics support the hypothesis that our patient most likely had 2 CNS inflammatory disorders: MS, which manifested as a teenager, and neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder, which evolved in her sixth decade of life. This case emphasizes a key principle in neurology practice, which is to reconsider whether the original working diagnosis remains tenable, especially when confronted with evidence (clinical and/or paraclinical) that raises the possibility of a distinctively different disorder.

This confirmed decreased CSF glucose and lactate levels in patients with GLUT1DS and increased glutamine at group level. We identified three novel biomarkers significantly decreased in patients, namely gluconic + galactonic acid, xylose-α1–3-glucose, and xylose-α1–3-xylose-α1–3-glucose, of which the latter two have not previously been identified in body fluids. CSF concentrations of gluconic + galactonic acid may be reduced as these metabolites could serve as alternative substrates for the pentose phosphate pathway. Xylose-α1–3-glucose and xylose-α1–3-xylose-α1–3-glucose may originate from glycosylated proteins; their decreased levels are hypothetically the consequence of insufficient glucose, one of two substrates for O-glucosylation. Since many proteins are O-glucosylated, this deficiency may affect cellular processes and thus contribute to GLUT1DS pathophysiology. The novel CSF biomarkers have the potential to improve the biochemical diagnosis of GLUT1DS. Our findings imply that brain glucose deficiency in GLUT1DS may cause disruptions at the cellular level that go beyond energy metabolism, underlining the importance of developing treatment strategies that directly target cerebral glucose uptake.

Second, to add longitudinal information on individual patients and assess the validity of following CSF glucose as a marker for response to treatment, we checked whether a linear relationship between logP and G was conserved over time. For each repeat CSF sample obtained between 1 week and 1 month of the initial CSF sample (n = 83 samples in 52 patients), we plotted the change in glucose (deltaG) vs the change in logP compared with its corresponding initial CSF sample: Third, to complement analysis of the average trend (linear regression) with an analysis of the extremes and to quantify the performance of CSF glucose and the glucose ratio in diagnosing microbial meningitis, we performed a receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis. True-positive rate and false-positive rate were calculated for detection thresholds on CSF glucose or the glucose ratio incrementing in 100 linear steps over the full range of values. All values are reported as mean ± SD, unless otherwise specified, and significance was accepted at p < 0.05 after Bonferroni correction.

### Interleukin-6 in neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder pathophysiology [^112ZAHAK]. Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a soluble, pleiotropic cytokine that plays a key part in many biologic processes. It is a primary regulator of acute and chronic inflammation and hematopoiesis, contributing to the onset and maintenance of various autoimmune and inflammatory disorders.

Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) is an uncommon, often debilitating, inflammatory condition of the CNS. Neuromyelitis optica (NMO) was previously considered a rare, severe variant of multiple sclerosis (MS); however, it is now recognized as a distinct autoimmune disorder. An International Panel for NMO Diagnosis codified clinical, radiologic, and laboratory features collectively distinguishing NMOSD from MS and other CNS inflammatory disorders. Left untreated, patients with NMOSD experience new attacks or relapses, often leading to permanent disability.

The pathophysiologic processes and inflammatory cascade in NMOSD are complex and not fully understood. Circulating immunoglobulin G (IgG) 1 antibodies targeting the astrocyte water channel aquaporin-4 (AQP4) have been found almost exclusively in patients with NMOSD. AQP4-IgG binding to astrocytic AQP4 leads to classical complement cascade activation and granulocyte and lymphocyte infiltration that combine to damage neural tissues.

IL-6 may drive disease activity in NMOSD by promoting plasmablast survival, stimulating AQP4-IgG secretion, reducing blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity and functionality, and enhancing proinflammatory T-lymphocyte differentiation and activation (figure A). CSF and serum IL-6 levels are significantly elevated in patients with NMOSD, and IL-6 inhibition has been shown to improve disease control (table 1). Therefore, the IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) represents a promising therapeutic target for NMOSD relapse prevention. This review summarizes the role of IL-6 in NMOSD.

Cerebrospinal fluid analysis

Cerebrospinal fluid analysis (CSF) was clear and transparent. The total count of mononuclear cells (25 cells/µL, 100%) indicated lymphocytic pleocytosis. Protein 0.33 g/L (normal range 0.23–0.38 g/L), glucose 3.17 mmol/L (normal range 2.77–4.44 mmol/L) and lactate level 2.03 mmol/L (normal range 0.6–3.1 mmol/L) remained within normal ranges. However, IgG was slightly elevated at 31.5 mg/L (normal range 10–30 mg/L), and oligoclonal bands were positive.

The infection profile of the CSF was negative for B. burgdorferi IgM and IgG antibodies (ELISA), cytomegalovirus (PCR), Epstein-Barr virus (PCR), herpes simplex virus type 1 and 2 (PCR), Varicella Zoster virus (PCR), M. tuberculosis (PCR) and Toxoplasma gondii (PCR). CSF culture did not reveal pathogen growth. Paraneoplastic antibodies in the CSF — including anti-amphiphysin, anti-CV2, anti-PNMA2, anti-SOX1, anti-RI, anti-Yo, anti-Hu, anti-Recoverin, anti-Titin, anti-Zic4, anti-GAD65 and anti-Tr — were all negative. Flow cytometry and cytological analyses did not detect any tumour markers in the CSF. Anti-MOG antibodies were absent in the CSF; however, intrathecal IgG anti-GluN1 antibodies were detected at a titre of 1:3.2 using the standard immunofluorescence test (IFT), confirming the diagnosis of anti-NMDA encephalitis.

(F) Axial T2 MRI of cervical spine demonstrates panmedullary cord involvement.

Four years later, the patient was readmitted to an outside community hospital with acute confusion and unresponsiveness. He was transferred to our center for high level of care. On examination, he was disoriented with time and situation and had global memory impairment. Cranial nerves were intact. He had severe weakness (1+) in the lower extremities. Vibration was reduced, whereas pinprick and light touch were intact. Deep tendon reflexes were diffusely brisk with bilateral Babinski signs.

Elevated ESR (34 mm/h, ref 0–17 mm/h), CRP (18.0 mg/L, ref 0–4.9 mg/L), and ANA (1:160, speckled) were found in the serum. Rheumatologic and autoimmune panels (NMO IgG, MOG IgG, ANCA, myeloperoxidase [MPO], and proteinase 3 [PR3]) were negative. ACE level was normal in the serum but elevated in the CSF (19 U/L; ref 0.1–2.0 U/L). QuantiFERON-TB was negative. CSF analysis showed xanthochromia, elevated protein (> 600 mg/dL), low glucose (39 mg/dL; serum glucose 94 mg/dL), and normal white blood cell count. Serum and CSF oligoclonal bands were negative. AFB stains and culture and MTB complex by PCR were negative in the CSF. Cytology showed rare lymphocytes (eTable1).

### Cerebrospinal fluid analysis in the workup of GLUT1 deficiency syndrome: a systematic review [^117GF2Fw]. JAMA Neurology (2013). Medium credibility.

Importance

GLUT1 deficiency syndrome is a treatable neurometabolic disorder, characterized by a low concentration of glucose in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and a decreased CSF to blood glucose ratio. Reports of patients with apparently normal CSF glucose levels, however, have raised the question whether CSF analysis is a reliable screening tool for GLUT1 deficiency syndrome.

Objective

To determine the value of CSF analysis in the workup of GLUT1 deficiency syndrome.

Evidence Review

PubMed was searched until July 2012 by using the terms glucose transporter 1 (GLUT-1) deficiency syndrome, glucose transporter defect, and SLC2A1-gene. Relevant references mentioned in the articles were also included. The CSF results of all patients with genetically proven GLUT1 deficiency syndrome described in literature were reevaluated.

Findings

The levels of glucose in CSF, the CSF to blood glucose ratios, and the levels of lactate in CSF were reported for 147 (94%), 152 (97%), and 73 (46%) of 157 patients, respectively. The CSF glucose levels ranged from 16.2 to 50.5 mg/dL and were at or below the 10th percentile for all 147 patients. The CSF to blood glucose ratios ranged from 0.19 to 0.59 and were at or below the 10th percentile for 139 of 152 patients (91%), but they could be within the normal range as well. The CSF lactate levels ranged from 5.4 to 13.5 mg/dL and were at or below the 10th percentile for 59 of 73 patients (81%). A typical CSF profile for GLUT1 deficiency syndrome, which is defined as a CSF glucose level at or below the 10th percentile, a CSF to blood glucose ratio at or below the 25th percentile, and a CSF lactate level at or below the 10th percentile, was found in only 35 of 4099 CSF samples (0.9%) present in our CSF database of patients who received a diagnosis other than GLUT1 deficiency syndrome.

Conclusions and Relevance

We conclude that if age-specific reference values are applied, CSF glucose and lactate levels are adequate biomarkers in the diagnostic workup of GLUT1 deficiency syndrome. Future availability of whole-exome sequencing in clinical practice will make the existence of a reliable biomarker for GLUT1 deficiency syndrome even more important, in order to interpret genetic results and, even more importantly, not to miss SLC2A1-negative patients with GLUT1 deficiency syndrome.

### Cerebrospinal fluid findings in aquaporin-4 antibody positive neuromyelitis optica: results from 211 lumbar punctures [^1121YNVW]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Neuromyelitis optica (NMO, Devic disease) is a severely disabling autoimmune disorder of the CNS, which was considered a subtype of multiple sclerosis (MS) for many decades. Recently, however, highly specific serum autoantibodies (termed NMO-IgG or AQP4-Ab) have been discovered in a subset (60–80%) of patients with NMO. These antibodies were subsequently shown to be directly involved in the pathogenesis of the condition. AQP4-Ab positive NMO is now considered an immunopathogenetically distinct disease in its own right. However, to date little is known about the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in AQP4-Ab positive NMO.

Objective

To describe systematically the CSF profile of AQP4-Ab positive patients with NMO or its formes frustes, longitudinally extensive myelitis and optic neuritis.

Material and Methods

Cytological and protein biochemical results from 211 lumbar punctures in 89 AQP4-Ab positive patients of mostly Caucasian origin with neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (NMOSD) were analysed retrospectively.

Results

CSF-restricted oligoclonal IgG bands, a hallmark of MS, were absent in most patients. If present, intrathecal IgG (and, more rarely, IgM) synthesis was low, transient, and, importantly, restricted to acute relapses. CSF pleocytosis was present in around 50% of samples, was mainly mild (median, 19 cells/μl; range 6–380), and frequently included neutrophils, eosinophils, activated lymphocytes, and/or plasma cells. Albumin CSF/serum ratios, total protein and CSF L-lactate levels correlated significantly with disease activity as well as with the length of the spinal cord lesions in patients with acute myelitis. CSF findings differed significantly between patients with acute myelitis and patients with acute optic neuritis at the time of LP. Pleocytosis and blood CSF barrier dysfunction were also present during remission in some patients, possibly indicating sustained subclinical disease activity.

Conclusion

AQP4-Ab positive NMOSD is characterized by CSF features that are distinct from those in MS. Our findings are important for the differential diagnosis of MS and NMOSD and add to our understanding of the immunopathogenesis of this devastating condition.
