## Question

Explain the role of a psychiatrist pre and post lung transplant

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the role of a psychiatrist before and after lung transplantation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the epidemiology and the impact of psychiatric morbidity on outcomes. Then, I should define pre-transplant psychiatric roles and risk stratification. Next, I will examine post-transplant monitoring and interventions. After that, I ought to align these roles with current guideline recommendations. Finally, I will consider special populations, evidence-based interventions, measurement tools, and a practical synthesis of how psychiatry integrates into the transplant team across the continuum.

> Let me first confirm the scope and magnitude of the problem, because if psychiatric burden is low, the role would be limited; but wait, the data consistently show high psychiatric morbidity in lung transplant candidates and clinically meaningful associations post-transplant. Pre-transplant, structured assessments report current psychiatric disorders in roughly 60% of evaluation patients, with prominent anxiety and mood syndromes, and distress correlated with physiologic severity, underscoring a high-need population [^notfound]. Post-transplant, worsening depressive symptoms over time are associated with higher mortality and precede declines in FEV1, and depression/distress measured at 6 months independently predict long-term mortality, so I need to treat depression trajectories as prognostically relevant signals rather than mere comorbidity [^113diYGr] [^116sQCwH].

> Next, I should review the psychiatrist's pre-transplant responsibilities; hold on, let's not jump to conclusions and assume "screening only". Comprehensive psychiatric and psychosocial evaluation using structured interviews and validated scales (for example, MINI, HADS, GHQ) is standard, integrated with medical context and decisional capacity assessment, because psychiatric history is a strong predictor of current distress and can affect candidacy and timing of listing [^116NGYcY] [^117SE85E]. Guidelines emphasize early referral to surface psychosocial barriers and optimize candidacy, so psychiatric input must start early in the evaluation process, not at the eleventh hour [^114vpkiH].

> Now, regarding psychosocial support and caregivers, my first thought is to label the absence of dependable support as an absolute contraindication; wait, I should verify and not overstate the guideline language. ISHLT guidance stresses thorough psychosocial evaluation, interval reassessment, and direct communication with transplant programs before concluding unsuitability; while many programs view inadequate support as prohibitive, the guideline emphasizes individualized assessment rather than a blanket "absolute" contraindication, and the evidence shows caregiver type associates with survival and graft failure risks, making this a critical modifiable domain for psychiatric intervention and caregiver engagement planning [^113Jtc1F] [^111PY4Ds] [^116887ZD].

> I need to ensure I address adherence and substance use clearly; let me check whether stabilization is required pre-listing. Cross-organ transplant evaluation guidance (KDIGO) explicitly recommends delaying evaluation until unstable psychiatric illness, ongoing substance use disorder, or persistent nonadherence despite counseling are adequately managed, and this maps onto lung programs' practices; depression is also associated with higher hospitalizations and medication nonadherence, reinforcing the need for proactive treatment to protect candidacy and outcomes [^112brcJ1] [^111HLVK3].

> I will now examine the medical-psychiatric interface, because symptom overlap can confound decisions; HADS-depression correlates with lung function and 6-minute walk distance, and a psychiatric history predicts current distress, so I should double-check whether mood symptoms are reactive to hypoxemia, steroid effects, or disease progression versus a primary mood disorder and treat both pathways as clinically meaningful. In COPD, high cardiovascular comorbidity further complicates assessment, warranting close liaison with pulmonary and cardiology teams when interpreting distress and functional limits [^116NGYcY] [^113Xxqz2].

> Next, I should review pre-transplant interventions and optimization; hold on, I need to confirm that brief psychotherapies are effective in this population. Quality-of-Life Therapy delivered by phone to waitlisted patients improved QOL, mood disturbance, and social intimacy at 1–3 months compared with supportive therapy, supporting targeted pre-transplant psychological care. Conceptually, psychiatric clearance is not binary; modifiable risk factors should be actively treated and re-assessed to enable listing, consistent with risk optimization frameworks that distinguish modifiable from nonmodifiable risk [^113Xw9hA] [^1179JfvR].

> I should confirm how to objectively quantify psychosocial risk; the Stanford Integrated Psychosocial Assessment for Transplant (SIPAT) provides a standardized approach. Let me reconsider its prognostic limits: higher SIPAT scores associate with a higher chance of being declined for transplant, but among those listed, SIPAT did not predict waitlist or post-transplant survival, which suggests effective pre-listing optimization can mitigate measured psychosocial risk; thus, SIPAT should guide targeted interventions rather than be used as a sole disqualifier [^116mb7EQ].

> Moving to early post-transplant care, I need to ensure routine screening for depression and distress, but wait, the timing matters because symptoms may initially improve. Serial assessments using validated instruments (for example, GDS or BDI-II) are warranted, and guideline-based practice emphasizes routine depressive symptom screening; worsening scores over time are associated with mortality and lung function decline, so trend monitoring is key. Pain trajectories in the first 2 months are worse with pre-transplant depression and anxiety, and elevated post-discharge depressive symptoms predict higher pain, highlighting a pain–mood bidirectionality that requires anticipatory management. Primary graft dysfunction attenuates improvements in health-related quality of life, so when PGD occurs, I should escalate psychiatric and rehabilitation supports to preserve function and coping [^111HLVK3] [^113diYGr] [^117PKAr5] [^114cXLDv].

> For long-term management, I should double-check the prognostic signal from depressive symptom trajectories; worsening GDS is associated with higher mortality and precedes chronic lung allograft dysfunction on temporal analyses, and higher depression and general distress at 6 months independently predict long-term mortality, which argues for treating psychiatric follow-up as part of medical surveillance. Adolescent and young adult recipients are at particularly high risk for nonadherence, requiring tailored psychiatric and behavioral strategies to safeguard graft survival [^113diYGr] [^116sQCwH] [^114M79bk].

> Let me consider specific post-transplant psychiatric syndromes; I need to check whether validated tools capture health anxiety and PTSD-like concerns. The LT-QOL instrument includes scales for worry about future health and anxiety/depression, reflecting the salience of health-related anxiety in recipients, and commentary highlights substantial "worry" content within the instrument. Neuropsychiatric complications from immunosuppression and medical comorbidities can drive mood and cognitive changes that require psychiatric management and coordination with the transplant team, so I should maintain a high index of suspicion when symptoms emerge after medication adjustments [^113Wo2k2] [^114ZXBZ7] [^116hPyC9].

> I should confirm the model of psychiatric integration with the transplant team; hold on, reactive consultation-liaison alone is likely insufficient. Contemporary reviews advocate proactive, embedded psychiatry across evaluation, waitlist, and survivorship phases, noting underutilization of psychiatric services despite clear benefits. Telehealth coping skills training plus exercise showed modest overall benefits and superior depression improvements in the subgroup with baseline depression, supporting scalable, targeted remote interventions within longitudinal care pathways [^116rJByP] [^1166UW9e].

> Next, I should review guideline anchors that structure psychiatric involvement. ISHLT guidance emphasizes early referral to surface barriers, interval psychosocial reassessment to maintain listing, and direct communication with transplant programs before determining psychosocial unsuitability; these general criteria operate within the broader mandate to select patients with high likelihood of 5-year survival and manageable risk when adequate graft function is assumed. Disease-specific sections (for example, CF and ILD) reiterate the importance of timing and stability, which should prompt psychiatric teams to anticipate stress points and adherence risks during disease acceleration [^114vpkiH] [^113Jtc1F] [^111PY4Ds] [^112MZZo9] [^115zpTQB] [^115VVtJR].

> I will now examine special populations; wait, I should verify pediatric data and the distinct adherence risks during adolescence. Pediatric cohorts demonstrate large QOL gains post-transplant yet require early psychological supervision and educational supports, with adherence challenges peaking in puberty and young adulthood, making sustained psychiatric engagement essential. In COPD, high cardiovascular burden complicates psychiatric assessment and may affect QOL, warranting tighter multidisciplinary coordination. Severe mental illness does not automatically preclude transplantation; case reports demonstrate feasibility with careful evaluation and perioperative psychiatric management, although I should note that some classic exemplars involve liver transplantation and extrapolate principles cautiously [^111vqUyn] [^114M79bk] [^113Xxqz2] [^1135n89N] [^117SE85E].

> Turning to evidence-based treatments, I need to ensure pharmacotherapy choices account for immunosuppressant interactions, and I should double-check for additive neurotoxicity risks; this argues for conservative titration and close collaboration with transplant pharmacology. Brief psychotherapy such as QOLT before transplant and telehealth coping skills training post-transplant show benefits, particularly when targeted to depressed patients, supporting a stepped-care model that blends psychotherapy with careful pharmacologic augmentation when indicated within an integrated CL framework [^113Xw9hA] [^1166UW9e] [^116rJByP].

> Next, I should review how to measure psychiatric care quality and outcomes; let me ensure we use validated instruments consistently across phases. Pre-transplant tools include MINI, HADS, GHQ, and SIPAT for psychosocial suitability, while post-transplant monitoring can leverage GDS, BDI-II, CES-D, STAI, Zung SDS, and LT-QOL to track mental health and health-status/QOL. Although pre-transplant HRQL scores do not predict survival, pediatric cohorts and longitudinal adult data document substantial QOL improvements post-transplant, making systematic measurement vital for guiding care and benchmarking services [^11793Gkf] [^115yJT89] [^111vqUyn] [^111Bvftx].

> But wait, what if I am overstating causality between depression and mortality; hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. These are predominantly observational associations, yet the temporal relationships and repeated measures strengthen the inference that worsening depressive symptoms can herald medical deterioration; clinically, that justifies embedding psychiatry as a surveillance partner and intervention lead within multidisciplinary care. In summary, psychiatrists function as diagnostic evaluators and risk stratifiers pre-transplant, optimizers of modifiable risk to enable listing, longitudinal monitors and treaters of depression and adherence risk post-transplant, and integral members of proactive, sometimes telehealth-enabled models of care that remain underutilized despite clear signals that psychiatric factors predict survival, lung function, and patient-reported outcomes [^113diYGr] [^116sQCwH] [^116rJByP].

Psychiatrists are integral to lung transplantation, providing **pre-transplant assessment** to identify and manage psychiatric comorbidities [^116NGYcY], substance use [^112brcJ1], and adherence risks [^113Xxqz2], and to optimize candidacy and readiness [^114vpkiH]. Post-transplant, they deliver **post-transplant support** through ongoing monitoring, early detection, and treatment of depression [^113diYGr], anxiety [^116sQCwH], PTSD, and cognitive effects of immunosuppression, while supporting adherence and coping with complications [^116rJByP]. Their continuous involvement improves adherence, reduces complications, and enhances quality of life and survival, making them essential members of the multidisciplinary transplant team [^116rJByP].

---

## Pre-transplant psychiatric assessment and intervention

### Comprehensive psychiatric evaluation

- **Psychiatric disorders**: Assess for depression, anxiety, PTSD, and substance use [^116NGYcY], which are common and impact outcomes [^116wkAV2].

- **Cognitive function**: Evaluate cognition, as impairment can affect adherence and decision-making [^113Wo2k2].

- **Social support**: Assess support systems, as inadequate support is a contraindication to transplantation [^116887ZD].

- **Adherence history**: Review adherence to medical regimens, as nonadherence predicts poor outcomes [^116wgUb2].

---

### Risk stratification and management

Risk identification targets **modifiable and nonmodifiable psychiatric risks** to guide candidacy and timing [^1179JfvR] [^113Xxqz2]. Intervention involves **treating psychiatric disorders and substance use** [^112brcJ1] to optimize candidacy and reduce post-transplant complications [^116rJByP].

---

### Patient education and counseling

Education provides information on **psychiatric risks, adherence, and coping strategies** [^1172v9Jc]. Counseling addresses **anxiety, depression, and stress related to the waiting period and surgery** [^113Xw9hA].

---

## Post-transplant psychiatric care and support

### Monitoring and early detection

Regular screening entails **monitoring for depression, anxiety, PTSD, and cognitive impairment** [^116wgUb2] — conditions that are common post-transplant [^113diYGr] [^116sQCwH]. Early intervention emphasizes **prompt detection and treatment of psychiatric symptoms** to improve adherence and outcomes [^116rJByP].

---

### Management of psychiatric complications

- **Depression and anxiety**: Treat these conditions [^111Bvftx], as they are linked to increased mortality and graft dysfunction.

- **PTSD**: Address trauma from surgery, ICU stays, and complications [^116wgUb2].

- **Cognitive impairment**: Manage neurocognitive effects of immunosuppression and chronic illness.

---

### Support for adherence and coping

Adherence support reinforces **consistent use of immunosuppression and other medical regimens** [^116rJByP]. Coping strategies help patients **manage chronic illness, complications, and lifestyle changes** [^114M79bk].

---

## Impact on patient outcomes

Psychiatric involvement **significantly improves outcomes** [^116rJByP] by enhancing adherence to immunosuppression and other medical regimens, reducing psychiatric complications, and improving quality of life. Treated depression and anxiety are associated with **lower mortality and graft dysfunction**.

---

## Integration within the multidisciplinary team

Psychiatrists are **essential team members** [^116rJByP] who collaborate with pulmonologists, surgeons, nurses, social workers, and psychologists to provide coordinated care and consistent messaging [^114rq95A]. They also provide **education and training** on psychiatric issues and adherence to support team-based management [^1145KhuE].

---

## Challenges and barriers

Psychiatrists face several challenges, including **stigma around mental health**, which hinders engagement, and **limited psychiatric resources and staffing** [^116rJByP]. They must manage **complex psychiatric and medical comorbidities** while addressing nonadherence and substance use [^112brcJ1].

---

## Recommendations for best practices

- **Standardized assessment**: Use standardized psychiatric assessments pre- and post-transplant [^116mb7EQ].

- **Early intervention**: Treat psychiatric disorders and substance use early [^116wgUb2].

- **Ongoing monitoring**: Regularly screen for psychiatric symptoms post-transplant.

- **Multidisciplinary care**: Integrate psychiatry into the transplant team [^114rq95A].

- **Patient education**: Provide education on adherence and coping [^1166UW9e].

---

Psychiatrists play a **critical role** in lung transplantation by conducting comprehensive pre-transplant assessments, managing psychiatric complications, and supporting adherence and coping post-transplant [^116rJByP]. Their involvement improves adherence, reduces complications, and enhances quality of life and survival, making them essential members of the multidisciplinary transplant team [^116rJByP].

### Psychiatric disorders and psychological distress in patients undergoing evaluation for lung transplantation: a national cohort study [^116NGYcY]. General Hospital Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

We sought to investigate the type and prevalence of psychiatric disorders and psychological distress in patients being evaluated for lung transplantation. One hundred eighteen patients were assessed (74% with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)) using the MINI Neuropsychiatric Interview, the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ), and the Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS). Spirometry and the 6-minute walk test (6MWT) were employed to assess lung function, with data subjected to multivariate regression analyses.

The lifetime prevalence for mental disorders was found to be 41.5% and 61.0%, respectively, with anxiety (39.8% of patients), mood disorders (11.8%), and subsyndromal disorders (8.7%) identified. Furthermore, 15% of patients reported feelings of panic during the last week, 9% reported hopelessness, and 3% felt that life was not worth living. Statistically significant correlates were derived for HADS-depression with lung function (P = 0.0012) and the 6MWT (P = 0.030) for the entire group (P = 0.012). For COPD patients, significant correlations were found with lung function (P = 0.030) (P = 0.045), for whom higher chronic GHQ scores were correlated with poorer lung function (P = 0.009). In multivariate regression analysis, a history of mental disorder was the strongest predictor of distress.

Our findings underline the importance of assessing past, current, and sub-syndromal psychiatric disorders in addition to levels of distress in transplant candidates. Prospective studies are needed to investigate the impact on long-term outcomes after transplantation.

### Depressive symptoms in lung transplant recipients: Trajectory and association with mortality and allograft dysfunction [^113diYGr]. Thorax (2022). Low credibility.

Most studies observing an association between depressive symptoms following lung transplantation and mortality are limited to depressive symptom measurement at a single time point, unrelated to allograft function. We aimed to test the association of depressive symptoms over multiple assessments with allograft dysfunction and with mortality.

- **Methods**: We assessed depressive symptoms before and serially up to 3 years after lung transplantation in lung transplant recipients. We quantified depressive symptoms with the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS; range 0–15; minimally important difference (MID): 2). We quantified changes in GDS using linear mixed effects models and tested the association with mortality using Cox proportional hazards models with GDS as a time-dependent predictor. To determine if worsening in GDS preceded declines in lung function, we tested the association of GDS as a time-dependent predictor with the lagged outcome of FEV₁ at the following study visit.

- **Results**: Among 266 participants, depressive symptoms improved early after transplantation. Worsening in post-transplant GDS by the MID was associated with mortality (HR 1.25, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.50) and in lagged outcome analyses with decreased percent predicted FEV₁ (Δ, -1.62%, 95% CI -2.49 to -0.76). Visual analyses of temporal changes in GDS demonstrated that worsening depressive symptoms could precede chronic lung allograft dysfunction.

- **Conclusions**: Depressive symptoms generally improve after lung transplantation. When they worsen, however, there is an association with declines in lung function.

### Advancing models of care in transplant psychiatry: A review and considerations for enhancing the multidisciplinary approach [^116rJByP]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2024). Low credibility.

Psychosocial considerations in transplant candidacy evaluation, waitlisting, and the post-transplant period are tremendously important to overall transplant care. Integration of mental health services into multidisciplinary transplant teams improves adherence to medical regimens, enhances quality of life, and reduces the risk of post-transplant complications.

Recent findings indicate that despite these benefits, psychiatrists are often under-utilized by transplant centers, with their engagement typically limited to transplant candidacy evaluations or reactive consults in a traditional consultation-liaison (CL) model. This review aims to highlight the relevance of psychiatry throughout the transplant course. We outline the role of a CL psychiatrist in advancing patient care and supporting multidisciplinary teams in transplant settings. Additionally, the review develops an understanding of CL service models in both inpatient and ambulatory settings and considers the utility of innovating transplant psychiatry practices.

### Psychosocial predictors of mortality following lung transplantation [^116sQCwH]. American Journal of Transplantation (2016). Low credibility.

Lung transplantation has become an increasingly common treatment for patients with end-stage lung disease. Few studies have examined psychosocial risk factors for mortality in transplant recipients, despite evidence suggesting that elevated levels of negative affect are associated with greater mortality following major cardiac surgery. We therefore examined the relationship between negative affect early after lung transplantation and long-term survival in a sample of 132 lung transplant recipients (28 cystic fibrosis, 64 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 26 idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, 14 other) followed for up to 13.5 years (median 7.4 years) following transplantation.

Patients underwent both medical and psychosocial assessments 6 months following transplantation, which included the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), Spielberger Anxiety Inventory, and General Health Questionnaire (GHQ). Over the course of follow-up, 80 (61%) participants died. Controlling for demographic factors, native lung disease, disease severity, family income, education level, social support, and frequency of post-transplant rejection, elevated symptoms of depression (BDI-II: HR = 1.31, p = 0.011) and distress (GHQ: HR = 1.28, p = 0.003) were associated with increased mortality.

Higher levels of depression and general distress, but not anxiety, measured 6 months following lung transplantation are associated with increased mortality, independent of background characteristics and medical predictors.

### Consensus document for the selection of lung transplant candidates: An update from the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation [^114vpkiH]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2021). High credibility.

Regarding surgical interventions for lung transplantation, particularly concerning general principles, the 2021 ISHLT guidelines recommend referring patients early. This early referral facilitates transplant education for the patient and caregivers, allows for an initial assessment of barriers to transplant, and helps determine the timing for a full evaluation with specific recommendations for optimizing candidacy.

### Health-related quality of life after pediatric lung transplantation [^111vqUyn]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2025). High credibility.

In comparison to patients with end-stage lung disease before transplantation, we observed an improvement in health-related quality of life across all categories, including the EuroQol Score, VAS score, and all five assessed dimensions. The median EuroQol Score for patients before transplantation was 0.374 (IQR 0.17–0.72), whereas the median EuroQol Score for transplanted patients was significantly higher at 1.0. Similarly, the median VAS score improved from 54.5 (IQR 38.5–77.5) before transplantation to 93 after the procedure. Notably, even many years post-transplantation, lung-transplanted patients maintained a higher median EuroQol Score and VAS score of 0.93 and 78.7, respectively, more than 10 years after transplant.

- **Employment and education status**: Post-transplant, 55% of patients were engaged in regular employment or education compared to 25% pre-transplant (n = 15/28 vs. n = 2/9). Additionally, a higher percentage of pre-lung transplantation patients were home-schooled than those in the post-transplant cohort when considering only those who generally attend school (age < 19 years; 10% vs. 50%, n = 3/29 vs. n = 4/8).

- **Complications**: Regarding post-transplant organ complications, including renal, hepatic, neurological, and psychological complications, as well as diabetes mellitus and post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder, more information can be found in Table 1.

### Quality of life after lung transplantation: A cross-sectional study [^116hPyC9]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2005). Low credibility.

The increase in life expectancy has emphasized the importance of quality of life after lung transplantation, although this issue has not been systematically investigated. This cross-sectional study aims to provide an overview of quality of life in lung transplant patients.

- **Methods**: Between April and July 2001, a set of four questionnaires was given to all adult, German-speaking lung transplant recipients (n = 108; response rate 87% [n = 94]): the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ), a lung-specific health status instrument; the Short Form-36 (SF-36), a general quality of life measure; the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS-D); and a self-reported questionnaire concerning sexual functioning, physical symptoms, adverse effects of immunosuppression, and satisfaction with outcome.

- **Results**: With regard to the SGRQ, all lung transplant recipients had significantly better scores, reflecting an enhanced quality of life compared to the reference values for patients with obstructive pulmonary disease (SGRQ: p < 0.001 in all sub-scales). The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and the Mental Component Summary Scale of the SF-36 did not differ significantly compared to published normative data in the healthy population. However, the side effects of immunosuppression were a major factor influencing the quality of life for lung transplant recipients, with 11% influenced strongly and 24% moderately. Seventy-six percent of lung transplant patients were highly satisfied with the transplant outcome, and 92% would opt for the procedure again.

### Timing of lung transplant evaluation: Considerations, barriers and alternatives [^1118kPfa]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Lung transplant evaluation is a critical process that requires careful timing and consideration. There are several factors that influence when a patient should be evaluated, including the progression of their lung disease and their overall health status.

- **Considerations**: The timing of the evaluation is crucial to ensure that patients are listed for a transplant at the optimal time in their disease trajectory. Delaying the evaluation can lead to missed opportunities for timely transplantation, whereas early evaluation may result in unnecessary stress for patients and their families.

- **Barriers**: Common barriers to timely evaluation include limited access to specialized centers and the variability in referral practices among healthcare providers. These obstacles can prevent patients from receiving the necessary evaluation at the appropriate time.

- **Alternatives**: To address these barriers, telemedicine and outreach programs have been proposed as alternatives to improve access to transplant evaluations. By leveraging technology, healthcare systems can potentially bridge the gap for patients who face geographical and logistical challenges.

In conclusion, the process of lung transplant evaluation requires a strategic approach that balances the urgency of transplantation with the practical constraints faced by patients and healthcare providers.

### Patterns and predictors of pain following lung transplantation [^117PKAr5]. General Hospital Psychiatry (2017). Low credibility.

Our objective was to examine variability in pain levels following lung transplantation and to examine individual biopsychosocial factors influencing changes in pain.

- **Method**: We performed a retrospective study of a cohort of 150 patients transplanted and discharged from Duke University Hospital between January 2015 and September 2016. During hospitalization and at clinic visits up to two months after discharge, subjective pain ratings were obtained using a 0–10 Numeric Rating Scale. Psychiatric diagnoses of anxiety and depression and Center for Epidemiological Studies - Depression (CES-D) scores collected after hospital discharge were examined as predictors of post-surgery pain. Medical and surgical variables were examined as covariates.

- **Results**: During hospitalization, pain ratings decreased over time (p < 0.001). Predictors of higher pain levels included pre-transplant history of depression (p = 0.001) and anxiety (p = 0.04), bilateral lung transplant (p = 0.03), and lower six-minute walk distance (p = 0.02). Two months after discharge, 18% of patients reported continued pain, and 34% remained on opioid pain medications. More frequent post-operative complications predicted higher pain levels in a univariate analysis (p = 0.02), although this relationship was attenuated after adjustment for depression. In a multivariate analysis, elevated CES-D scores (p = 0.002) and greater opioid use (p = 0.031) predicted higher pain levels 2 months post-discharge.

We conclude that patients with psychiatric comorbidities may be at risk for greater pain.

### Psychiatric considerations in the patient receiving organ transplantation: A clinical case conference [^117SE85E]. General Hospital Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

Psychiatric consultations to evaluate a patient's suitability to receive organ transplantation require integrating multiple types and sources of information. During such a consultation, a patient's social support network, history of treatment compliance, ongoing Axis I and Axis II disorders, and understanding of the procedure and follow-up required must all be evaluated. This article presents the case of a woman with borderline personality disorder who developed hepatic failure following a drug overdose and discusses her evaluation for liver transplantation. The discussion frames the pertinent issues in the transplant evaluation and describes the perioperative (transplant) management of the borderline patient.

### Pre-transplant depression as a predictor of adherence and morbidities after orthotopic heart transplantation [^111HLVK3]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Depression after cardiac surgery is well described. Numerous studies have demonstrated an association between increased morbidity and mortality in depressed patients with concomitant cardiovascular disease compared to non-depressed patients. Depression is a known marker of poor outcomes after transplant. The International Society of Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) recommends routine screening for depressive symptoms. In our study, we found that the outcomes between patients with and without pre-transplant depression did not differ in survival, total number of organ rejections, and compliance with outpatient appointments. Depressed patients had higher overall hospitalizations, higher number of first-year hospitalizations, and shorter time to hospitalization compared to the non-depressed cohort. Furthermore, depressed patients had higher rates of admission for infections and were more likely to be non-compliant with medications.

There is a high incidence of depression after OHT, often requiring regular screening and early intervention to be initiated during work-up using validated tools such as the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) or Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9). The BDI-II is a brief, validated, easy-to-use scale that covers all DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder, and stands as a reliable indicator of symptom severity and suicidal thoughts. BDI-II has high reliability and good correlation with measures of depression and anxiety.

### Exploring the meaning of chronic rejection after lung transplantation and its impact on clinical management and caregiving [^112fincx]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2010). Low credibility.

Although the literature continues to portray chronic rejection after lung transplantation as ominous with no known treatment, no studies have examined family and clinician caregivers' perceptions of the diagnosis of chronic rejection and its impact on the course of clinical care. We explored the meaning and impact of chronic rejection from the perspective of family (n = 10) and clinician (n = 3) caregivers.

Family caregivers considered the onset of chronic rejection to be inevitable, irreversible, unpredictable, and a return to pretransplant conditions. Clinicians viewed chronic rejection as a harbinger of deterioration and peril and expressed trepidation about informing recipients and their family caregivers about the diagnosis.

Despite heightened caregiving duties and challenges in treating chronic rejection, its unpredictable course and the prospect of retransplant instilled hope for stabilization or cure among most clinicians and caregivers, leading them to support recipients' wishes to pursue potentially futile treatments. Until recipients were no longer competent, caregivers believed all treatment options (including retransplant) had been exhausted, or suffering was prolonged, they were reluctant to halt extraordinary treatment measures.

Caregivers perceived that certainty regarding poor prognosis was required for palliative care and that palliative care was viewed as end-of-life care. Consequently, trials of aggressive treatment typically precluded palliative care.

### European respiratory society guidelines for the diagnosis and management of lymphangioleiomyomatosis [^111hCZWe]. The European Respiratory Journal (2010). High credibility.

Regarding surgical interventions for lung transplantation, specifically in the context of pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis, the ERS 2010 guidelines recommend administering the same post-transplant regimen of immunosuppression to patients with lymphangioleiomyomatosis as for other indications.

### A randomized evaluation of quality-of-life therapy with patients awaiting lung transplantation [^113Xw9hA]. American Journal of Transplantation (2005). High credibility.

Research shows that patients wait-listed for lung transplantation have very poor quality of life (QOL). This study evaluated the effectiveness of Quality-of-Life Therapy (QOLT) in improving QOL, mood disturbance, and social intimacy in adults awaiting lung transplantation. Thirty-five adults were randomized to QOLT (n = 17) or supportive therapy (ST; n = 18) and received individual, telephone-based treatment sessions. QOL, mood, and social intimacy assessments were conducted at baseline and at 1 and 3 months after treatment.

Repeated measures analyses of variance showed significant Condition x Time interaction effects for all three primary outcome measures. Subsequent post hoc analyses showed that the two groups did not differ significantly at baseline but did differ significantly at the 1- and 3-month follow-up assessments. When compared to ST patients, QOLT patients had significantly higher QOL scores at the 1- and 3-month assessments, lower mood disturbance scores at the 3-month assessment, and higher social intimacy scores at the 1-month assessment. Results indicate that a patient's QOL, mood state, and relationship with the primary caregiver can be positively impacted by a brief psychological intervention prior to lung transplantation.

### Primary graft dysfunction attenuates improvements in health-related quality of life after lung transplantation, but not disability or depression [^114cXLDv]. American Journal of Transplantation (2021). Low credibility.

Disability, depressive symptoms, and impaired health-related quality of life (HRQL) are common among patients with life-threatening respiratory compromise. We sought to determine if primary graft dysfunction (PGD), a syndrome of acute lung injury, attenuates improvements in patient-reported outcomes after transplantation. In a single-center prospective cohort, we assessed disability, depressive symptoms, and HRQL before and at 3- to 6-month intervals after lung transplantation. We estimated the magnitude of change in disability, depressive symptoms, and HRQL with hierarchical segmented linear mixed-effects models.

Among 251 lung transplant recipients, 50 developed PGD Grade 3.

- **Improvement in outcomes**: Regardless of PGD severity, participants had improvements in disability and depressive symptoms, as well as generic-physical, generic-mental, respiratory-specific, and health-utility HRQL, exceeding 1- to 4-fold the minimally clinically important difference across all instruments.

- **Impact of PGD Grade 3**: Participants with PGD Grade 3 had a lower magnitude of improvement in generic-physical HRQL and health-utility than all other participants. Among participants with PGD Grade 3, prolonged mechanical ventilation was associated with greater attenuation of improvements.

PGD remains a threat to the two primary aims of lung transplantation: extending survival and improving HRQL. The attenuation of improvement persists long after hospital discharge. Future studies should assess if interventions can mitigate the impact of PGD on patient-reported outcomes.

### Psychiatric disorder and quality of life in patients awaiting lung transplantation [^116wkAV2]. Chest (2003). Low credibility.

This study aimed to examine the relationship between psychiatric comorbidity and quality of life in patients awaiting lung transplantation. Conducted at Duke University Medical Center's Lung Transplantation Program, the study included 100 patients with end-stage pulmonary disease listed for lung transplantation.

Twenty-five percent (n = 25) of the sample met the diagnostic criteria for at least one mood or anxiety disorder. Controlling for age, gender, ethnicity, percentage of predicted FEV, and lung disease diagnosis, patients with a psychiatric diagnosis reported poorer general quality of life (p < 0.0001), poorer disease-specific quality of life (p < 0.0001), greater shortness of breath (p = 0.01), more symptoms of psychological distress (p < 0.0001), lower levels of social support (p < 0.0001), and fewer positive health habits (p < 0.04) compared to their counterparts without a psychiatric diagnosis.

The conclusions indicated that psychiatric comorbidity affects a significant portion of patients awaiting lung transplantation and is associated with decreased health-related quality of life.

### A new tool to capture patients' perceptions of the effects of lung transplantation [^113Wo2k2]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

In this issue of the journal, Singer and colleagues describe the development and initial testing of a questionnaire that aims to assess quality of life (QOL) after lung transplantation. Rather than developing their own items de novo, these lung transplant and questionnaire-development experts used clusters of items from existing questionnaires to capture aspects of life after lung transplant. They initially identified 126 items comprising clusters from eight questionnaires. Next, they conducted 43 cognitive interviews with lung transplant recipients who were asked whether the words and grammar used for individual items were clear and whether there was redundancy in the items or clusters. For clusters that tapped the same construct (e.g. respiratory symptoms), interviewees were asked to select which item cluster more clearly reflected their definition of health-related QOL. Forty-two items were dropped after the interviews, leaving 84 items for field testing. Results from an exploratory factor analysis led the investigators to drop another 24 items. This left their questionnaire, which they call the Lung Transplant Health-Related Quality of Life (LT-QOL) survey, with 60 items comprising 10 scales (pulmonary symptoms, gastrointestinal symptoms, neuromuscular symptoms, treatment burden, worry about future health, cognitive limitations, sexual problems, anxiety/depression, health distress, and general QOL).

Analyses showed that the LT-QOL has acceptable-to-excellent psychometric properties, ranging from internal consistency to floor and ceiling effects. In support of its validity, its sc

### Health-related quality of life after pediatric lung transplantation [^116VKzEC]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2025). Low credibility.

This approach ensures early psychological supervision and intervention, as well as educational support, including contact with schools during the months of pre- and post-transplant in-hospital admissions. This integrated care may contribute to the favorable socioeconomic outcomes observed in our cohort.

Based on our findings, clinical experience, and literature, we propose that optimal health-related quality of life (HRQOL) following transplantation is best supported through a multidisciplinary, individualized care model initiated as early as the pre-transplant phase. This should include regular psychological assessments by experienced professionals to identify modifiable risk factors and enable timely interventions. Early recognition and management of medical complications and immunosuppressant side effects should be approached not only from a clinical standpoint but also with a focus on enhancing post-transplant quality of life.

Additionally, specific attention should be given to addressing potential social limitations, incorporating tailored educational and social support. The integration of modern technologies, such as virtual platforms and secure online communities, may help to overcome hygiene-related barriers, facilitating peer interaction to foster emotional support, knowledge exchange, and social reintegration.

Further research to understand the interplay of extended socioeconomic aspects with post-transplant quality of life is of interest. This might not only assess economic settings but also include factors such as familial and friendship support, identity development, and personal goals.

### Utility of the Stanford integrated psychosocial assessment for transplant in predicting outcomes before and after lung transplantation [^116mb7EQ]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2024). Low credibility.

Optimizing donor use and achieving maximal survival following lung transplantation (LTx) require a pretransplant assessment that identifies clinical, physiological, and psychosocial patient factors associated with both poor and optimal post-LTx survival. We examined the utility of a psychosocial tool, the Stanford Integrated Psychosocial Assessment for Transplant (SIPAT), to identify patient suitability for LTx, as well as its association with clinical outcomes before and after LTx.

- **Methods**: This was a retrospective single-center study analyzing LTx assessment clinical variables (age, gender, diagnosis, functional capacity, nutrition, renal function), with a particular focus on the utility of the SIPAT score to predict patient suitability for LTx. The same variables were analyzed against LTx waitlist mortality, as well as post-LTx survival.

- **Results**: Over an 8-year period dating from December 2012, 914 patients (male 54.4%, mean age 55.2 years) underwent LTx assessment. Patients declined for LTx (n = 152, 16.6%) were older and had reduced functional capacity, nutritional markers, and renal function but had a higher SIPAT score. Once listed for LTx, a higher SIPAT score was not associated with waitlist mortality or reduced post-LTx survival.

- **Conclusions**: The SIPAT tool measures psychosocial suitability for transplantation that can be incorporated into a standardized assessment of LTx suitability. While patients with a higher SIPAT score were more likely to be declined for LTx, the SIPAT score did not predict outcome in transplanted patients.

### Impact of primary caregivers on long-term outcomes after lung transplantation [^116887ZD]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2015). Low credibility.

Guidelines consider the absence of a dependable social support system as an absolute contraindication to lung transplantation, yet there are varying degrees of social support among those selected for transplantation. We sought to characterize the relationship between a patient's self-reported primary caregiver and long-term outcomes after lung transplantation.

- **Methods**: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of all lung transplant recipients aged 18 years and older who had undergone an initial transplant from 2000 to 2010. Cox regression was used to explore the relationship between type of caregiver and the long-term risk of death and chronic graft failure while adjusting for potential confounders.

- **Results**: There were 452 patients undergoing lung transplantation over the study period who met the inclusion criteria. Five types of primary caregivers were identified, with spouses being the most common at 60% (270 of 452). Compared with spousal caregiver, overall survival was significantly worse for patients who identified an adult child (hazard ratio [HR] 2.04, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.15 to 3.60) or sibling (HR 3.79, 95% CI 2.48 to 5.78) as their primary caregiver. In addition, the risk for long-term graft failure was increased significantly (HR 3.34, 95% CI 1.58 to 7.06) among patients with sibling caregivers.

- **Conclusions**: The type of primary caregiver selected before transplantation was associated with long-term outcomes. These results may reflect the long-term support requirements and/or competing responsibilities of other caregiver types.

### A new tool to capture patients' perceptions of the effects of lung transplantation [^114ZXBZ7]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

There may be some hidden redundancy in the LT-QOL: 10% (n = 6) of the items (from three different scales) include the term "worry", "worried", or "worrying" (e.g. "I worry that my lung transplant will not work, about getting infections, that my health will get worse, about not being able to stop or control worrying", "worrying too much about different things", and "is health a worry in your life?"). However, redundancy only lengthens the questionnaire; it does not detract from its psychometric soundness.

This work suggests that the LT-QOL is a valuable new tool capable of capturing patients' perceptions of the effects of lung transplantation. It provides a foundation upon which to conduct additional analyses to support the validity of this tool. Establishing the validity of a questionnaire is an ongoing process, not a threshold phenomenon, and involves using well-formulated hypotheses to test the questionnaire in many studies, under multiple conditions, to understand what its scores can reveal about respondents. The LT-QOL is ready for use in observational and interventional studies. The investigators have placed the LT-QOL in the public domain, allowing others to use it freely. They suggest administering a generic QOL questionnaire alongside it. The next phase of analyses should assess how the LT-QOL tracks the post–lung transplant course, establish its responsiveness to changes in health status over time post-transplantation, and determine its sensitivity for detecting differences in the health-status/QOL trajectory between groups.

### Special considerations and techniques of interventions in lung transplant recipients [^117EAok8]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2023). Low credibility.

Lung transplantation remains an important treatment option for patients with end-stage lung diseases, providing improvement in survival rates and quality of life. Specialized considerations should be applied to interventions for lung transplant recipients, as they present specific anatomic variations and have a high risk of certain complications.

In this article, we highlight the role of interventional radiology for lung transplant recipients, along with a discussion of interventional techniques. Specific emphasis is placed on describing and explaining the techniques related to the points of anastomosis, diagnosis and treatment of malignancies, and management of complications in lung transplant recipients.

### Trajectories of change in quality of life in 12-month survivors of lung or heart transplant [^1143k72V]. American Journal of Transplantation (2006). Low credibility.

Survival and functional outcomes for lung transplant recipients continue to lag behind those for heart recipients. Whether these poorer physical outcomes translate into poorer quality of life (QOL) for lung recipients relative to heart recipients is unknown. Lung versus heart transplant recipients' perceptions of QOL were longitudinally compared at three time points across the first year posttransplant. Additionally, potentially important predictors of patient QOL were examined.

Adult transplant recipients (N = 199) participated in semi-structured interviews that included measures of QOL, optimism, mastery, social support, religiosity, and coping. Temporal patterns of QOL change were compared between lung and heart recipients who survived until 1 year posttransplant using mixed-model, hierarchical analysis of variance (ANOVA). Demographic and psychosocial predictors were examined with multiple regression analysis to identify the unique effects of each variable on QOL 1 year posttransplant.

While heart recipients' QOL across several domains was higher shortly after transplant, lung patients' QOL improved and was equivalent to that of heart recipients by 1 year posttransplant. Greater optimism and support from friends predicted better QOL in physical, psychological, and social domains. Conversely, avoidant coping strategies predicted poorer physical functioning. Thus, while clinical interventions designed to improve QOL posttransplant should be tailored to transplant recipients' initial psychosocial assets and liabilities, they need not be distinguished by transplant type.

### Imaging indications and findings in evaluation of lung transplant graft dysfunction and rejection [^111PCfAq]. Insights into Imaging (2020). Low credibility.

Lung transplantation is a treatment option in end-stage lung disease. Complications can develop along a continuum in either the immediate or longer post-transplant period, including surgical and technical complications, primary graft dysfunction, rejection, infections, post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder, and recurrence of the primary disease. These complications have overlapping clinical and imaging features and often co-exist. The time of onset after transplant is helpful in narrowing down the differential diagnosis.

In the early post-transplantation period, imaging findings are non-specific and need to be interpreted in the context of the clinical picture and other investigations. In contrast, imaging plays a key role in diagnosing and monitoring patients with chronic lung allograft dysfunction. The goal of this article is to review primary graft dysfunction, acute rejection, and chronic rejection, with an emphasis on the role of imaging, pathology findings, and differential diagnosis.

### Pre-transplant quality of life does not predict survival after lung transplantation [^115yJT89]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2008). Low credibility.

Currently, the goal of lung transplantation is not only to improve survival but also to enhance health-related quality of life (HRQL). Limited knowledge is available about the value of HRQL before lung transplantation in predicting survival post-transplant. To maximize the benefits of transplantation, it is essential to understand the variables that predict both the length and quality of survival. In this study, we sought to determine whether HRQL before transplantation predicts survival after lung transplantation.

- **Methods**: For each of the 200 lung transplant recipients included in this study, the HRQL questionnaire completed at the date closest to the transplant date was selected. Measures included were: the Nottingham Health Profile (NHP), State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS-Zung), Karnofsky Performance Scale, and Index of Well-Being (IWB). Cox regression models were used to determine whether pre-transplant scores predicted post-transplant survival.

- **Results**: Survival rates at 1, 3, and 5 years were 85%, 73%, and 69%, respectively. Mean scores on all pre-transplant HRQL measures were unfavorable compared with reference values for the general population. No significant predictors for survival after lung transplantation were found.

- **Conclusions**: Results suggest that scores on the various HRQL measures before transplantation did not predict survival after lung transplantation. The present results do not support the usefulness of pre-transplant HRQL measures for the selection of lung transplant recipients.

### A new tool to capture patients' perceptions of the effects of lung transplantation [^114jcgSC]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

The LT-QOL has some limitations, and more work needs to be done. Although the authors describe how the LT-QOL is more comprehensive than existing questionnaires, its 10 scales cover only five broad constructs: physical health, emotional/mental health, treatment burden, sexual health, and general QOL. Measurement experts may argue that the LT-QOL does not measure health-related QOL. Inquiring about the frequency or intensity of symptoms (physical or emotional/mental) addresses health status, but this line of inquiry is subtly different from specifically asking how those symptoms — or the condition in all its aspects — affect the full spectrum of life domains that contribute to QOL. I would classify the LT-QOL as a hybrid health-status/QOL questionnaire developed specifically for the post-lung transplant population. Its last two items — which I find commendable ("I am able to enjoy life" and "I am content with the quality of my life right now") — address general QOL. However, they do not reveal how the transplant affects the respondent's QOL or ability to enjoy life.

- **Significance**: It is crucial to emphasize what distinguishes this questionnaire, as many investigators who utilize the LT-QOL may not be measurement experts and may not review its content in detail. Typically, they might see its name and assume it captures a comprehensive view of QOL after lung transplantation. They should understand exactly what they are obtaining by using it.

### Extracorporeal life support as a bridge to lung transplantation: Where are we now [^114rq95A]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2022). High credibility.

The number of lung transplant procedures performed internationally is increasing, but the donor organ pool is insufficient to meet demand, and waiting list mortality is unacceptably high. As survival rates for patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome managed on extracorporeal life support (ECLS) have steadily improved, a potential role for ECLS to support critically ill patients awaiting a donor organ match has emerged. We explore the rapidly evolving landscape of ECLS as a bridge to lung transplantation with a review of the patient selection criteria, predictors of survival, modes of pre- and peri-transplant support, and the importance of a holistic multidisciplinary approach to care. Finally, we consider innovations that are envisaged to increase the accessibility, safety, and effectiveness of ECLS delivery for future lung transplant candidates.

### Consensus document for the selection of lung transplant candidates: An update from the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation [^111u8HQv]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2021). Low credibility.

Tens of thousands of patients with advanced lung diseases may be eligible as potential candidates for lung transplants around the world each year. The timing of referral, evaluation, determination of candidacy, and listing of candidates continues to pose challenges and ethical dilemmas. To address these challenges, the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation appointed an international group of members to review the literature, consider recent advances in the management of advanced lung diseases, and update prior consensus documents on the selection of lung transplant candidates.

The purpose of this updated consensus document is to assist providers worldwide who are caring for patients with pulmonary disease in identifying potential candidates for lung transplants, optimizing the timing of patient referrals to lung transplant centers, and providing transplant centers with a framework for evaluating and selecting candidates. In addition to addressing general considerations and providing disease-specific recommendations for referral and listing, this updated consensus document includes an ethical framework. It also recognizes the variability in the acceptance of risk between transplant centers and establishes a system to account for how a combination of risk factors may be considered in candidate selection for lung transplantation.

### Psychosocial vulnerability, physical symptoms and physical impairment after lung and heart-lung transplantation [^113t26Up]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2003). Low credibility.

Many lung and heart-lung transplant recipients experience distressing physical symptoms and elevated physical impairment levels. Although post-transplant complications and secondary illnesses may largely account for these health limitations, patients' psychosocial well-being may influence them as well. We examined the contribution of psychosocial variables to patients' experience of physical symptoms and physical impairment.

- **Methods**: The study consisted of a cross-sectional sample of 50 patients (36 lung, 14 heart-lung) between 2 and 17 months post-transplant. They were interviewed to assess physical symptoms, physical impairment, and psychosocial well-being in the areas of mental health, sense of mastery, and coping. Medical record reviews established the presence of medical complications and secondary illnesses concurrent with the interviews. Descriptive analyses examined the range of symptoms and levels of physical impairment experienced. Bivariate analyses and multivariate linear regression examined relationships between key variables.

- **Results**: The average number of physical symptoms and level of physical impairment met or exceeded levels reported in other transplant samples. Elevated depressive and anxiety symptoms, a low sense of mastery, and the presence of medical complications were each associated with an increased number of physical symptoms and physical impairment level. When the impact of medical complications was controlled, recipients with elevated psychological distress remained significantly more likely to report more physical issues.

### Patient-reported health outcomes in long-term lung transplantation survivors: A prospective cohort study [^111Bvftx]. American Journal of Transplantation (2018). Low credibility.

This study applied two domain-specific health-related quality of life (HRQoL) instruments to evaluate anxiety and depression. Anxiety was measured with the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), a 20-item self-report measure in which responses are given on a 4-point Likert scale from 4 (always) to 1 (never). The overall score ranges from 20 to 80, with 80 representing the worst possible state of anxiety. Depression was measured with the Zung Self-rating Depression Scale (SDS), a 20-item self-report instrument with a 4-point Likert scale used to evaluate the psychological, affective, and somatic symptoms associated with depression. The overall score ranges from 25 to 100, where high scores indicate severe symptoms.

We followed the standard instructions of the Zung and STAI instruments. When calculating overall scores, if the number of missing items was equal to or less than two, we imputed their value by taking the mean of the other items. Overall scores with more than two missing items were excluded from the analysis.

In addition, the Nottingham Health Profile (NHP) was used as a generic HRQoL instrument. The NHP is a self-report tool that contains 38 items and measures six domains of HRQoL: emotional reactions, social isolation, sleep, pain, energy, and physical mobility. The response categories for each item are "yes" and "no". Separate scores are calculated for each domain and lie between 0 and 100, whereby higher scores represent lower levels of HRQoL.

### Health-related quality of life long-term study in lung transplant patients: A single-center experience [^112Uj7pA]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2024). Low credibility.

Health-related quality of life (HRQL) assessment plays a crucial role in the follow-up care of lung transplanted (LTx) patients. Previous reports have indicated that the HRQL achieved by these patients is often poorer compared to that of healthy individuals. However, the factors contributing to this lower HRQL remain unclear. This prospective study aimed to assess the effectiveness of using both a generic and a disease-specific HRQL instrument in evaluating the outcomes of patients who have undergone LTx.

- **Methods**: A total of 111 LTx patients were enrolled in the study, with 88 survivors completing the 5-year follow-up and 23 nonsurvivors identified within the first 3 years. Among the participants, 84 underwent double LTx, while 27 received a single LTx. Patients were interviewed before LTx, at 6 months post-transplantation, and annually thereafter. Two validated instruments were utilized: the Euro Quality of Life Five Dimensions, a generic measure, and the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ), a disease-specific questionnaire.

- **Results**: The study showed significant improvements in Euro Quality of Life Five Dimensions scores from 6 months after LTx. Specifically, the percentage of patients without mobility problems increased from 23% before LTx to 71% at 5 years (P = 0.004). However, there was no significant improvement in other dimensions.

### Parent-reported health status after pediatric thoracic organ transplant [^116hSzu7]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2004). Low credibility.

Thoracic organ transplantation is a life-changing event for a child and family from both a physical and a psychosocial perspective. Accurate pre-transplantation counseling and effective post-transplantation follow-up depend on a good understanding of post-transplantation health status, especially as perceived by families.

- **Methods**: The Child Health Questionnaire-Parent Form 50 (CHQ-P50), an instrument that assesses parent-reported health status of pediatric patients, was administered to 47 pediatric thoracic organ transplant recipients (41 heart, 6 lung) aged 5 to 18 years.

- **Results**: Transplant recipients scored lower on the Physical Health Summary (PhS) score than the general population, as evidenced by a lower median score (50.6 vs. 55.1, p < 0.0001) and a difference in the distribution of quartiles (p = 0.001), skewed toward the lower quartiles of the general population. The distribution of PhS scores in transplant recipients was comparable to scores of three groups of pediatric patients with other chronic health conditions (juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, epilepsy, and asthma). The distribution of the Psychosocial Health Summary (PsS) scores was similar to that of the general population, but the median score was lower (51.5 vs. 53.2, p = 0.02). Transplant patients clearly scored lower than the general population on four of 12 sub-scales, including those assessing general health, physical functioning, family activities, and parental emotional impact. No difference was found in sub-scales reflecting self-esteem, mental health, behavior, pain, peer interactions, and family.

Regarding surgical interventions for cystic fibrosis, particularly in the context of lung transplantation, the ISHLT 2021 guidelines recommend listing patients with CF for lung transplantation if they meet any referral criteria combined with any of the following:

- **FEV₁ 30% relative decline**: A forced expiratory volume in 1 second over 12 months.

- **Frequent hospitalization**: Particularly if hospitalization exceeds 28 days in the preceding year.

- **Any exacerbation requiring mechanical ventilation**.

- **Chronic respiratory failure**: Characterized by hypoxemia or hypercapnia, particularly with increasing oxygen requirements or the need for long-term noninvasive ventilation therapy.

- **Pulmonary hypertension**: Indicated by a pulmonary arterial systolic pressure greater than 50 mmHg on echocardiogram or evidence of right ventricular dysfunction.

- **Worsening nutritional status**: Particularly with a BMI of less than 18 kg/m² despite nutritional interventions.

- **Massive hemoptysis**: Persistent despite bronchial artery embolization.

- **WHO functional class IV**.

### A new tool to capture patients' perceptions of the effects of lung transplantation [^116pz9yx]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

For patients with many incurable, life-shortening lung conditions, lung transplantation offers "curative" therapy and the only therapeutic option with a reliable chance to improve their quality of life (QOL). But what is really meant by the term "QOL", and how do we measure this abstract construct?

For individuals, QOL refers to their perceptions of how well their needs and wants are met across dimensions of life that matter most to them. Thus, accurate assessments of QOL require knowledge of patients' perceptions, their needs and wants, and the dimensions of life they care about. Carefully crafted questionnaires, developed with systematically collected input from patients with the condition of interest, can capture all these things.

Until now, investigators and other stakeholders interested in examining the effect of lung transplantation on a person's QOL have had to rely on existing questionnaires. However, none of those questionnaires adequately address all of the domains that are important to patients after lung transplantation, including, among other things, emotional well-being, pulmonary and extrapulmonary symptoms, effects of immunosuppression, and neurocognitive status. In fact, some experts say that many existing questionnaires — even ones that call themselves "QOL" or "health-related QOL" questionnaires — are really measures of health status. They measure certain domains (and do it well), but by confining themselves to assessing physical and/or emotional health, they fail to capture other domains that contribute to a person's QOL, including physical and emotional aspects.

### A thematic analysis of quality of life in lung transplant: The existing evidence and implications for future directions [^1172v9Jc]. American Journal of Transplantation (2013). Low credibility.

Health-related quality of life (HRQL) has been assessed in various lung transplantation (LT) investigations but never analyzed systematically across multiple studies. We addressed this knowledge gap through a systematic literature review, searching the PubMed, CINAHL, and PsychInfo databases for publications from January 1, 1983, to December 31, 2011. We performed a thematic analysis of published studies on HRQL in LT. Using a comparative, consensus-based approach, we identified themes that consistently emerged from the data, classifying each study according to primary and secondary thematic categories and study design.

Of 749 publications initially identified, 73 remained after exclusions. Seven core themes emerged:

1. **Determinants of HRQL**: Explored factors influencing HRQL.
2. **Psychosocial factors in HRQL**: Examined the role of psychological and social factors.
3. **Pre- and posttransplant HRQL comparisons**: Compared HRQL before and after transplantation.
4. **Long-term longitudinal HRQL studies**: Analyzed long-term HRQL data.
5. **HRQL effects of therapies and interventions**: Assessed the impact of treatments on HRQL.
6. **HRQL instrument validation and methodology**: Focused on validating and improving HRQL measurement tools.
7. **HRQL prediction of clinical outcomes**: Investigated how HRQL could predict clinical outcomes.

Overall, LT significantly and substantially improves HRQL, predominantly in domains related to physical health and functioning. The existing literature demonstrates substantial heterogeneity in methodology and approach; relatively few studies assessed HRQL longitudinally within the same individuals. Opportunities for future study lie in validating existing and potential novel HRQL instruments and further elucidating the determinants of HRQL through longitudinal multidimensional investigation.

### Telehealth interventions to improve outcomes in lung transplant recipients: Primary results of the INSPIRE-III randomized clinical trial [^1166UW9e]. Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2025). High credibility.

There is growing evidence that many patients undergoing lung transplantation report significant distress and low physical activity (PA), which might not improve despite the transplant and may be associated with worse clinical outcomes. Few studies have attempted to improve psychological outcomes and functional capacity and PA after transplant.

- **Methods**: Investigational Study of Psychological Interventions in Recipients of Lung Transplant-III is a single-site, randomized clinical trial in which 180 post-lung transplant patients, recruited between November 2019 and October 2023, completed a psychometric test battery to assess distress and functional capacity measured by the 6-Minute Walk Test and PA assessed by 7 consecutive days of continuous activity monitoring. Participants were then randomly assigned to either a 12-week Coping Skills Training and Exercise intervention (CSTEX) or a Standard of Care plus Education (SoC-ED) program delivered via telephone. Participants were then retested after completion of the telehealth interventions.

- **Results**: After 12 weeks, both intervention groups achieved small but similar improvements in distress and functional capacity. Although there were no between-group differences overall, patients who were considered clinically depressed at baseline and received CSTEX achieved greater improvements in depression compared to depressed patients who received SoC-ED.

- **Conclusions**: Although patients in both CSTEX and SoC-ED showed only modest benefit from their respective interventions, a subgroup of patients in CSTEX who were depressed at baseline experienced greater improvements compared to their counterparts.

### Health-related quality of life after pediatric lung transplantation [^117UFwEn]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2025). Low credibility.

Even when expecting a reduction of psychological disorders by transplantation, routine surveillance and early detection are essential. These practices not only improve the overall quality of life but also address their well-documented association with patient adherence, which is crucial in post-transplant care and is a common problem, especially during puberty.

Lung transplantation is also associated with lifestyle restrictions due to necessary infection prophylaxis measures. Although most pronounced in the first 6–12 months, these limitations can lead to long-term social and economic burdens for patients and their families.

Socioeconomic aspects of our study cohort were evaluated by assessing schooling, education, employment, and housing situations. The rate of employment or education was 69% for the entire study cohort, with 63% of patients over 18 years being in regular or part-time occupation. These results are challenging to interpret due to confounding factors such as social avoidance measures during phases of high immunosuppressive therapy and adolescent patients being in the transition from education to work life. Nonetheless, they were generally better than previously published data on adult transplant recipients, with only 13%–38% reintegrating into the workforce. Overall, our study demonstrated a good rate of social integration.

On the other hand, a high percentage of recipients (86%) lived with their parents, including 50% of patients above 18 years of age. This might suggest a certain level of dependency or support network available to these patients.

### A systematic review of health-related quality of life and psychological outcomes after lung transplantation [^11793Gkf]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2016). Low credibility.

Lung transplantation (LTx) aims to reduce physical disability and mental distress, extend survival, and improve health-related quality of life (HRQoL). In this systematic review, we aimed to: (1) augment evidence regarding measures to assess HRQoL and psychological outcomes after LTx, and (2) summarize HRQoL and psychological outcomes after LTx.

- **Methods**: Validated and standardized instruments with well-known psychometric properties used for assessing HRQoL and psychological outcomes after LTx were identified by means of comprehensive literature searches of PsychINFO and Medline/PubMed up through March 2014, using the following search terms in various combinations: lung transplantation; physical functioning; symptom experience; mental health; anxiety; depression; distress; social functioning; life satisfaction; and health-related quality of life.

- **Results**: The search strategy identified 371 titles and abstracts. Of these, 279 were retrieved for further assessment and 63 articles selected for final review. Thirty-nine studies were found for HRQoL, 15 for physical functioning, 5 for mental health, and 4 for social functioning. A total of 50 psychometric instruments were encountered.

- **Conclusions**: Considerable heterogeneity exists in methodology, operational concepts, and applied outcome measures in the existing literature on HRQoL and psychological outcomes after LTx. Nevertheless, the studies generally point to significant improvements in both mental health and HRQoL post-transplant. Further research is warranted utilizing consistent outcome measures, including LTx.

### The role of radiology in addressing the challenge of lung cancer after lung transplantation [^111RAAbN]. European Radiology (2022). Low credibility.

The importance of lung cancer as a complication of lung transplantation is increasingly recognized. It may become an important survival-limiting factor in lung transplant patients as management of other complications improves, and utilization of extended criteria donors grows. Radiology can play a key role in tackling this issue at multiple stages in the transplantation pathway and follow-up process.

Routine chest CT as part of pre-transplant recipient assessment (and donor assessment if available) can identify suspicious lung lesions with high sensitivity and detect chronic structural lung diseases such as pulmonary fibrosis, which is associated with an increased risk of malignancy post-transplant. Pre-transplant CT also provides a comparison for later CT studies in the assessment of nodules or masses. The potential role of regular chest CT for lung cancer screening after transplantation is less certain due to limited available evidence on its efficacy.

Radiologists should be cognizant of how the causes of pulmonary nodules in lung transplant patients may differ from the general population, vary with time since transplantation, and require specific recommendations for further investigation/follow-up as general guidelines are not applicable. As part of the multidisciplinary team, radiology is involved in an aggressive diagnostic and therapeutic management approach for nodular lung lesions after transplant, both through follow-up imaging and image-guided tissue sampling. This review provides a comprehensive overview of available clinical data and evidence on lung cancer in lung transplant recipients.

### Psychosocial issues in the assessment and management of patients undergoing lung transplantation [^116wgUb2]. Chest (2006). Low credibility.

This review examines psychosocial issues among lung transplant patients from the time of assessment through the post-transplant period. Although psychological factors are recognized as being important in the transplant evaluation, no standard approach to psychological assessment currently exists. Lung transplant candidates often experience high levels of psychological distress while awaiting transplant, and both pre-transplant and post-transplant psychological functioning have been found to predict post-transplant quality of life, adherence to treatment, and, in some cases, medical outcomes. Given the limited long-term survival following transplantation, improving psychosocial functioning is essential for enhancing outcomes among lung transplant recipients. This review summarizes the extant literature on the psychosocial factors in lung transplantation and highlights several innovative efforts to improve psychological outcomes in this challenging patient population.

### Consensus document for the selection of lung transplant candidates: An update from the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation [^1117iLnH]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2021). High credibility.

Regarding surgical interventions for lung transplantation, and more specifically concerning indications in lung cancer, ISHLT 2021 guidelines recommend limiting lung transplantation to very select cases of lung-limited adenocarcinoma in situ, minimally invasive adenocarcinoma, or lepidic predominant adenocarcinoma in whom:

- **Surgical resection is not feasible**: Either because of multifocal disease or significant underlying pulmonary disease.

- **Significant lung restriction**: Multifocal disease has resulted in significant lung restriction and respiratory compromise.

- **Medical oncology therapies**: Have failed or are contraindicated.

- **Curative expectation**: Lung transplant is expected to be curative.

Regarding surgical interventions for lung transplantation, specifically with respect to general principles, the ISHLT 2021 guidelines recommend considering lung transplantation in adult patients with chronic, end-stage lung disease who meet all the following general criteria:

- **High risk of death**: There is a high (> 50%) risk of death from lung disease within two years if lung transplantation is not performed.

- **High likelihood of post-transplant survival**: There is a high (> 80%) likelihood of five-year post-transplant survival from a general medical perspective, provided there is adequate graft function.

### Psychiatric issues in pediatric organ transplantation [^114M79bk]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Solid organ transplantation has become the first line of treatment for a growing number of life-threatening pediatric illnesses. With improved survival, research into the long-term outcomes of transplant recipients has gained importance for clinicians. Adherence to medical instructions remains a challenge, particularly in the adolescent population. New immunosuppressant approaches promise to expand organ transplantation in additional directions. Furthermore, the extension of transplantation into replacing organs such as faces and hands raises complex ethical issues.

### Pregnancy after thoracic organ transplantation [^1145KhuE]. Seminars in Perinatology (2007). Low credibility.

A growing number of heart, heart-lung, or lung transplant recipients are women of reproductive age. Fertility and pregnancy are important issues in this group of patients and often pose complex medical, psychosocial, and ethical problems. Many successful pregnancy outcomes have been reported following heart or lung transplantation. Nevertheless, these patients are at risk of certain maternal, fetal, and neonatal complications, including hypertension, preeclampsia, infection, preterm birth, and low birth weight. The physiological changes that occur in pregnancy are generally well tolerated by patients who have undergone thoracic organ transplants.

The risk of allograft rejection during and after pregnancy is significant, and it is important to maintain an adequate level of immunosuppression. Pregnancies among lung transplant recipients are at higher risk for certain complications. The rate for graft rejection, independent of pregnancy status, is higher in this population. Long-term graft and patient outcomes, citing a 50% 5-year mortality, will be critical when counseling these patients regarding the impact of pregnancy on survival and their ability to participate in raising the child.

A multidisciplinary team, involving specialists in maternal-fetal medicine, cardiology or pulmonary medicine, transplant medicine, anesthesiology, high-risk nursing, neonatology, psychology, genetics, and social service, is crucial to the care of these patients. This team approach should be initiated at the time of pre-transplant and preconception counseling and be continued throughout the pre and post-transplant periods.

### The psychosocial correlates of transplant survival [^1137WGi2]. Journal of Cystic Fibrosis (2003). Low credibility.

Due to the shortage of organs, half of the patients on the waiting list for transplantations die. Clinicians have a duty to identify those patients who might benefit the most. The correlation between psychosocial factors and survival in children who have received lung transplantation for cystic fibrosis (CF) has not been investigated.

- **Aims**: To examine:
	1. Differences in physical, demographic, and psychological factors between two groups of children with CF: those who did or did not survive the waiting period for transplantation.
	2. Correlations between these factors pre-transplantation and length of survival post-transplantation.

- **Methods**: Eighty-one children, with a mean age of 11 years 6 months, and their parents underwent semi-structured standardized interviews and completed standardized instruments prior to being placed on the transplantation waiting list. The following domains were measured: child's disability, psychiatric status, and self-esteem; quality of marital relationship and parental psychiatric status; and family attitudes and functioning.

- **Results**: Twenty percent of the children on the waiting list had a psychiatric disorder, and 60% of the parents scored within the psychiatric disorder range. One-third of the parents had marital difficulties, and 20% of the families showed chaotic functioning. Only half of the children survived to receive transplantation. Survivors and non-survivors were comparable with regard to all psychological measures. A follow-up of the transplanted children, ranging from 3 to 156 months post-transplantation, produced a group of nine survivors and 30 non-survivors. Only two children…

### Timing of lung transplant evaluation: Considerations, barriers and alternatives [^113Xxqz2]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2025). High credibility.

General considerations that pose the risk and benefit of a lung transplant (LTx) should be taken into account when referred. Age, body weight, functional status, and comorbidity — which includes cardiovascular disease, renal insufficiency, coronary artery disease, gastrointestinal dysfunction, psychological risk factors, and infectious disease — should all be thoroughly investigated.

In chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients, some of these general considerations might be more worrisome. With increasing age and potentially more comorbidity in potential lung transplant candidates, some of these considerations should be placed in a broader perspective. The prevalence of cardiovascular disease in COPD might be as high as 70%. Management and treatment at the time of transplant evaluation and listing is a prerequisite. There is a significantly increased cardiovascular disease risk post-LTx in general. Due to the high prevalence of cardiovascular disease in COPD as a consequence of systemic inflammation and smoking, the risk of development or progression of cardiovascular disease post-LTx might, therefore, be higher.

Furthermore, osteoporosis in COPD is common despite treatment. In addition to the side effects of steroids, an insufficient diet and sedentary lifestyle might negatively affect bone density in COPD. Unfortunately, there are no specific data on cardiovascular disease or osteoporosis in COPD post-LTx to draw any firm conclusion to be a 'barrier' for evaluation or listing. Although LTx improves quality of life in COPD, cardiovascular disease and osteoporosis might have an effect on quality of life post-LTx.

### Consensus document for the selection of lung transplant candidates: An update from the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation [^113dZbeT]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2021). High credibility.

Regarding surgical interventions for lung transplantation, particularly in the context of re-transplantation, the ISHLT 2021 guidelines suggest considering the rate of deterioration, the time elapsed since the initial transplant, the necessity for supportive therapies, and the availability of donor lungs, which may be a limiting factor. The timing of re-transplantation presents a complex issue.

### Considering candidates: Modifiable and nonmodifiable risk factors for lung transplantation [^1179JfvR]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

The purpose of this review is to evaluate a candidate's risk profile for lung transplant by identifying which patient factors can be modified to minimize transplant risk. While some risk factors are modifiable, others cannot be changed.

Recent findings indicate that several risk factors for lung transplant can be completely resolved, thereby reducing a candidate's transplant risk. Although some features cannot be eliminated, they can still be optimized to minimize risk. Other risk factors are inherently unchangeable and present risk to transplantation, with certain nonmodifiable factors considered absolute barriers to the procedure.

Robust research and novel therapies have enhanced the ability to modify specific risk factors, subsequently decreasing lung transplant risk. Further studies are essential to improve understanding of how to estimate risk profiles when assessing candidacy and timing for lung transplants.
