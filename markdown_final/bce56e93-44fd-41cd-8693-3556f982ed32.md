## Question

Is aspirin monotherapy appropriate for lysis in massive pulmonary embolism?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether aspirin monotherapy is appropriate for lysis in massive pulmonary embolism. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how massive (high‑risk) PE is defined and why it mandates urgent reperfusion. Then, I should verify current guideline‑directed therapy for massive PE. Next, I will compare the pharmacologic mechanisms of aspirin versus thrombolytics to check whether aspirin can lyse established clots. After that, I should review the evidence for aspirin in PE to ensure I'm not missing any acute treatment role. Finally, I will synthesize a conclusion and consider alternatives when thrombolysis is contraindicated, while double-checking bleeding risks and timing of action in this life‑threatening setting [^115uSEkd] [^113vYhaW] [^114prENX].

> Let me first confirm the definition and risk tiering, because treatment hinges on it. Massive, or high‑risk, PE is characterized by sustained hypotension, obstructive shock, or cardiac arrest, and carries the highest early mortality, which is why timely reperfusion rather than anticoagulation alone is critical in this phenotype [^115uSEkd] [^113vYhaW] [^111dAsX9].

> Next, I should review guideline‑directed acute therapy. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to check at least two independent society statements. The ESC 2019, ACCP/CHEST 2016, and ASH 2020 guidelines consistently recommend systemic thrombolytic therapy for high‑risk PE with hemodynamic compromise, followed by therapeutic anticoagulation, rather than anticoagulation alone, because reperfusion is needed to rapidly unload the right ventricle and restore perfusion [^115uSEkd] [^113vYhaW] [^114prENX].

> Now, I will examine mechanisms of action to see if aspirin can plausibly lyse clot. Aspirin irreversibly inhibits platelet COX‑1, reducing thromboxane A2 and new platelet aggregation; it prevents thrombus formation and growth but has no fibrinolytic activity, whereas alteplase and tenecteplase convert plasminogen to plasmin, directly degrading fibrin within established thrombi with onset over minutes to hours in acute PE; wait, let me verify labeling and pharmacology to be sure I'm not overstating the speed — yes, rt‑PA is indicated for PE and acts rapidly to lyse clot, while aspirin is not a lytic agent [^1172Hcmg] [^112cwcM9].

> I need to check whether any high‑quality evidence places aspirin in the acute PE treatment pathway. The ASH 2020 and CHEST 2016/2021 guidance position aspirin, if at all, in the secondary prevention phase after completion of anticoagulation for unprovoked VTE, and even recommend suspending aspirin during the period of therapeutic anticoagulation in patients taking it for primary cardiovascular prevention; that strongly suggests no role for aspirin in acute PE reperfusion [^11539VMv] [^115aJ3TB] [^113snL8X] [^113udtMh].

> Let me review the randomized data on aspirin in VTE to ensure I'm not missing an acute signal. The WARFASA and ASPIRE trials evaluated low‑dose aspirin after cessation of anticoagulation for unprovoked VTE and demonstrated modest reductions in recurrent VTE or composite vascular outcomes, but neither trial assessed aspirin for acute clot lysis or for hemodynamically unstable PE, confirming aspirin's role is limited to recurrence prevention after anticoagulation, not acute reperfusion [^115wvdUE] [^112UEpPj].

> But wait, what if there were any reports of aspirin acting as a thrombolytic in PE? I should double‑check across guideline texts and trials focused on acute reperfusion. There is zero recommendation for aspirin as a lytic in massive PE, and acute trials of reperfusion, such as PEITHO and related meta‑analyses, evaluate thrombolytics — not aspirin — underscoring that platelet inhibition does not substitute for fibrinolysis in this context [^1125PLxj] [^111dAsX9].

> Next, I should review outcome data for thrombolysis to balance urgency against bleeding risk. Systemic thrombolysis reduces death or hemodynamic collapse and PE recurrence at the cost of increased major bleeding, with the mortality benefit most compelling in high‑risk PE where the absolute risk is greatest, which is precisely the scenario of massive PE with hypotension or shock; let me verify with pooled analyses and earlier RCTs, which show reductions in escalation and decompensation with rt‑PA plus heparin versus heparin alone [^111dAsX9] [^117MtHKZ].

> I need to ensure practical options are considered when bleeding risk is prohibitive or thrombolysis fails. Contemporary pathways include catheter‑directed therapies and surgical embolectomy, often coordinated by PE response teams, and in extremis ECMO may bridge to definitive reperfusion; hold on, I should verify guideline positioning and comparative recommendations, noting ASH suggests systemic thrombolysis over catheter‑directed thrombolysis when thrombolysis is indicated, while interventional options remain essential when systemic lysis is contraindicated or unsuccessful [^115BB6ph] [^112DT7D9] [^111yWkqL].

> Bringing this together, I should confirm the final answer and preempt misinterpretation. No, aspirin monotherapy is not appropriate for thrombolysis in massive pulmonary embolism; aspirin does not dissolve established clots and has no role in acute reperfusion for high‑risk PE, where systemic thrombolysis followed by full anticoagulation is guideline‑directed therapy; aspirin may be considered only later for recurrence prevention after anticoagulation cessation in selected unprovoked VTE, and should generally be held during therapeutic anticoagulation if used for primary prevention [^115uSEkd] [^113vYhaW] [^114prENX] [^11539VMv] [^113udtMh].

Aspirin monotherapy is **not effective** for clot lysis in massive pulmonary embolism (PE) because it neither dissolves fibrin-rich clots nor improves hemodynamics or survival. Current guidelines recommend **systemic thrombolysis** with agents such as alteplase or tenecteplase for massive PE because these therapies reduce mortality and recurrence despite an increased bleeding risk [^114prENX]. Aspirin may be considered only for secondary prevention after completing anticoagulation — not for acute treatment [^113snL8X].

---

## Pharmacological mechanism of aspirin

Aspirin **irreversibly inhibits cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1)**, reducing thromboxane A2 production and platelet aggregation. This antiplatelet effect is useful in arterial thrombosis; however, **venous clots are fibrin-rich and relatively platelet-poor**, so aspirin does not lyse them.

---

## Clinical evidence for aspirin in massive pulmonary embolism

There is **no evidence** supporting aspirin monotherapy for massive PE; available data show only a modest benefit for **secondary prevention after anticoagulation**, not for acute treatment. The **WARFASA trial** evaluated aspirin 100 mg daily after anticoagulation and reduced recurrent VTE (6.6% vs 11.2%; HR 0.58) in secondary prevention, not acute PE [^115wvdUE]. The **ASPIRE trial** similarly tested aspirin 100 mg daily after anticoagulation and showed a non-significant reduction in recurrent VTE (4.8% vs 6.5%; HR 0.74) [^112UEpPj]. These trials excluded patients with massive PE and did not assess acute lysis or hemodynamic outcomes.

---

## Current clinical guidelines

Guidelines consistently recommend **systemic thrombolysis** for massive PE — not aspirin:

- **ASH 2020**: Thrombolysis followed by anticoagulation for PE with hemodynamic compromise [^114prENX].
- **ESC 2019**: Systemic thrombolysis for high-risk (massive) PE [^115uSEkd].
- **ACCP 2016**: Systemic thrombolysis for acute PE with hypotension if bleeding risk is acceptable [^113vYhaW].

Aspirin is **not recommended** for acute PE; it may be considered only for **secondary prevention** after completing anticoagulation [^113snL8X].

---

## Comparative effectiveness of aspirin versus thrombolytic therapy

Thrombolytics (alteplase, tenecteplase) are effective for **clot lysis** and **hemodynamic improvement** in massive PE, though with increased bleeding risk. In the **PEITHO trial**, tenecteplase reduced death or hemodynamic decompensation at 7 days (2.6% vs 5.6%; OR 0.44) but increased major bleeding (11.5% vs 2.4%) [^1125PLxj]. A **meta-analysis** likewise found that thrombolysis reduced early mortality (OR 0.59) and PE recurrence (OR 0.50) but increased major bleeding (OR 2.91) [^114CJu1K]. Aspirin **does not provide comparable efficacy** for acute PE lysis or hemodynamic stabilization.

---

## Safety profile of aspirin compared to thrombolytic agents

Aspirin has a **lower bleeding risk** than thrombolytics; however, this does not offset its **lack of efficacy** in massive PE. Thrombolytics increase major bleeding, including intracranial hemorrhage, and are indicated when benefits outweigh risks [^1125PLxj].

---

## Clinical scenarios where aspirin might be considered

Aspirin may be considered only for **secondary prevention** in patients with unprovoked VTE who are stopping anticoagulation and have no contraindications [^113snL8X]. It is **not appropriate** for acute massive PE.

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Aspirin monotherapy is **not effective** for clot lysis in massive PE and is not recommended for acute treatment. Systemic thrombolysis remains the **standard of care** for massive PE; catheter-directed thrombolysis or surgical embolectomy are alternatives if systemic thrombolysis is contraindicated or unavailable. Aspirin may be used only for **secondary prevention** after anticoagulation.

The study PEITHO, published by Meyer G and colleagues in 2014 in the journal *N Engl J Med*, explores the role of tenecteplase in normotensive patients with intermediate-risk pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis.

- **Study design**: The PEITHO study was a multi-center, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial (RCT) including 1005 patients (532 female, 473 male). The inclusion criteria focused on normotensive patients with intermediate-risk pulmonary embolism. Key exclusion criteria were significant bleeding risk, coagulation disorders, administration of thrombolytic agents within the previous 4 days, uncontrolled hypertension, hypersensitivity to tenecteplase, alteplase, UFH, pregnancy, lactation, or parturition within the previous 30 days.

- **Interventions**: Patients were randomized to receive one of two interventions:
	- Tenecteplase group (n = 506) received fibrinolysis as a single weight-based intravenous bolus of 30–50 mg tenecteplase administered over 5–10 seconds.
	- Placebo group (n = 499) received a single intravenous bolus of the same volume and appearance as the tenecteplase bolus.

- **Primary outcome**: The primary outcome was a significant decrease in death or hemodynamic decompensation at 7 days, with results showing 2.6% in the tenecteplase group versus 5.6% in the placebo group (OR 0.44, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.87).

- **Secondary outcomes**:
	- There was no significant difference in death at 7 days between groups (1.2% vs. 1.8%; OR 0.65, 95% CI 0.23 to 1.85).
	- There was a significant decrease in the rate of hemodynamic decompensation within 7 days (1.6% vs. 5%; OR 0.3, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.68).

The study demonstrated beneficial outcomes in the use of tenecteplase for this patient group, primarily in reducing hemodynamic decompensation.

### Efficacy of alteplase thrombolysis for ED treatment of pulmonary embolism with shock [^111mP8Wy]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Our objective was to assess the efficacy and tolerance of thrombolysis using 0.6 mg/kg of Alteplase in patients with massive pulmonary embolism, defined as the association of a pulmonary embolism with shock. We retrospectively included 21 patients presenting with a massive pulmonary embolism confirmed by either scintigraphy or spiral computed tomography. Patients were treated on the basis of a standard rationale followed by thrombolysis with 0.6 mg/kg Alteplase over a period of 15 minutes. Hospital mortality, vital signs before and 2 hours after thrombolysis, and the incidence of hemorrhagic events were recorded. Five patients (23.8%) died, 4 of these deaths occurred during the first 4 hours after hospital admission. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure (Sp02) were significantly improved 2 hours after the beginning of thrombolysis. Five minor hemorrhagic events occurred. This study demonstrates that for patients with pulmonary embolism and shock, a bolus treatment with Alteplase is potentially effective and well tolerated.

The objective of this meta-analysis is to assess the impact of using thrombolysis alone or combined with anticoagulant (AC) on mortality, bleeding, recurrence, clinical deterioration, and hospital stay in patients with pulmonary embolism (PE). This analysis will provide critical insights to guide clinical decision-making and optimize patient outcomes in the management of PE.

### Systemic thrombolytic therapy for acute pulmonary embolism: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115sU6S5]. European Heart Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Systemic thrombolytic therapy is associated with a significant reduction in overall mortality in patients with pulmonary embolism (PE), though this reduction is not statistically significant when studies involving high-risk PE are excluded. Thrombolytic therapy effectively reduces PE-related mortality, the combined outcome of death or treatment escalation, and symptomatic PE recurrence. However, it is linked to an increase in fatal, intracranial, or major hemorrhage. Due to this narrow risk–benefit ratio, further analysis based on individual data is required to identify which subgroup of patients with non-high-risk PE might benefit from thrombolytic therapy.

### Anticoagulant impact on clinical outcomes of pulmonary embolism compared with thrombolytic therapy; meta-analysis [^115se6Ao]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). Low credibility.

Catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT) involves the use of a catheter to deliver thrombolytic agents directly to the site of the clot. This approach aims to enhance clot dissolution while minimizing systemic exposure to thrombolytics, thereby reducing the risk of major bleeding. CDT has gained attention as a potential therapy for submassive pulmonary embolism (sPE), where the goal is to reduce right ventricular strain and improve hemodynamic outcomes without the high bleeding risks associated with systemic thrombolysis.

Systemic thrombolytic therapy, which involves the intravenous administration of thrombolytic agents, has been traditionally reserved for massive pulmonary embolism (PE) with hemodynamic instability. However, its role in the treatment of acute intermediate-risk PE remains controversial. While systemic thrombolysis can effectively dissolve clots and improve pulmonary perfusion, it is also associated with significant bleeding complications. Thus, the balance between efficacy and safety is a critical consideration in its use.

The decision-making process for the management of PE is complex, involving the assessment of patient-specific factors such as the severity of the PE, comorbid conditions, and the risk of bleeding. The heterogeneity of PE presentations and the varying responses to treatment further complicate this process. Additionally, the optimal therapeutic approach for submassive and intermediate-risk PE continues to be debated, with ongoing research aiming to delineate the most effective and safest strategies.

Given the significant morbidity and mortality associated with PE, there is a pressing need for further research and consensus on treatment guidelines.

Recent advances in pharmacotherapeutics and interventional techniques have renewed interest in the optimal management of hemodynamically significant pulmonary embolic disease. However, these techniques have various associated disadvantages. It is crucial for the responsible physician to have a detailed understanding of each method to request and perform the appropriate intervention.

By way of background discussion and relevant case analysis, we consider each management option in turn, with particular reference to the advantages, disadvantages, and application of each.

### Electronic cardiac arrest triage score best predicts mortality after intervention in patients with massive and submassive pulmonary embolism [^115KsiHP]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2018). Low credibility.

The objective was to determine if the cardiac arrest triage (CART) score would better predict poor outcomes after pharmacomechanical therapy (PMT) for massive and submassive pulmonary embolism (PE) than traditional risk scores. PMT for massive and submassive PE allows for clot lysis with minimal doses of fibrinolytics. Although PMT results in improved right ventricular function and reduced pulmonary pressures and thrombus burden, predictors of poor outcomes are not well-studied.

- **Methods**: We conducted a retrospective analysis of all patients who underwent PMT for massive or submassive PE at a single institution from 2010 to 2016. The CART score and electronic CART (eCART) score, derived previously as early warning scores for hospitalized patients, were compared to the pulmonary embolism severity index (PESI) using the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC) for predicting 30-day mortality.

- **Results**: We studied 61 patients (56 ± 17 years, 44.0% male, 29.5% massive PE, mean PESI 114.6 ± 42.7, mean CART 13.5 ± 1.39, mean eCART 108.5 ± 28.6). The 30-day mortality was 24.6%. Treatments included rheolytic thrombectomy (32.7%), catheter-directed thrombolysis (50.8%), ultrasound-assisted thrombolysis (32.7%), and mechanical thrombectomy (4.9%). There were no differences in outcomes based on technique. The eCART and CART scores had higher AUCs compared to PESI in predicting 30-day mortality (0.84 vs. 0.72 vs. 0.69, P = 0.010). We found troponin I and pro-BNP were higher in higher eCART tertiles; however, AUCs were 0.51 and 0.63, respectively, for 30-day mortality when used.

### Fibrinolytic therapy in pulmonary embolism: an evidence-based treatment algorithm [^116kAfbp]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Patients presenting with pulmonary embolism (PE) have a wide spectrum of clinical severity. Although some patients may present with frank hemodynamic collapse and cardiac arrest, others may have an asymptomatic PE discovered incidentally during the workup of another condition. Fibrinolytic therapy is an option in treating PE due to its ability to rapidly dissolve thromboembolic clots. However, the use of fibrinolytics in PE treatment is a controversial topic that has left many practicing physicians confused about how to best treat these patients.

A rational approach to deciding whether fibrinolytic therapy is indicated is based on assessing the benefit that each particular patient will derive from fibrinolytic therapy weighed against the patient's risk for major bleeding and intracranial hemorrhage. There is a clear benefit/risk ratio for fibrinolytic therapy in patients with PE who present with cardiac arrest or are hemodynamically unstable from a massive PE. With proper risk assessment, select patients with stable hemodynamics and right ventricular dysfunction may also benefit from fibrinolytic therapy. There is no benefit to fibrinolytic treatment in patients with stable hemodynamics and normal right ventricular function.

This article reviews the literature on fibrinolytic therapy in treating patients with PE and proposes an evidence-based treatment algorithm.

### Anticoagulant impact on clinical outcomes of pulmonary embolism compared with thrombolytic therapy; meta-analysis [^1128ZbiK]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). Low credibility.

Assessing the precise likelihood of significant hemorrhage based on available literature is hindered by various complexities. Various thrombolytic drugs and dose regimes are used in individual research, each with its own distinct dangers. Sample sizes frequently lack sufficient magnitude to evaluate the risk associated with a specific treatment plan. There is inconsistency in the definitions of substantial bleeding across different research.

Early studies sometimes reported bleeding issues associated with the vascular access sites used for pulmonary angiography, which often required blood transfusions. The rates of pulmonary embolism (PE) diagnostic tests may be lower in modern practice using noninvasive methods. A prior investigation showed the potential hazards of significant bleeding in patients who underwent therapy for PE using a dosage of 100 mg of alteplase at a solitary medical facility. The analysis identified several significant risk factors, including:

- **Major surgery within the past 3 weeks**: (OR 9.00, 95% CI 1.01−79.99).
- **International normalized ratio (INR) greater than 1.7**: (OR 13.20, 95% CI 1.54−113.52).
- **Weighing less than 100 kg**: (OR 1.18 for every 10 kg below 100 kg, 95% CI 1.01−1.37).
- **Presence of at least one of the following characteristics**: (OR 5.02, 95% CI 1.78−18.55): internal bleeding in the previous 4 weeks, hypertension, acute myocardial infarction, positive stool occult test, presence of an intra‐aortic balloon pump, African American race, gastrointestinal bleeding in the previous 3 months, aortic dissection, acute pancreatitis, and cardiopulmonary risk factors.

### Systemic thrombolytic therapy for acute pulmonary embolism: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113zqJoK]. European Heart Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Pulmonary embolism recurrence was reported in 11 studies involving 1,928 patients. The reported incidence of pulmonary embolism (PE) recurrence was 1.3% (13/966) among patients allocated to thrombolytic therapy and 2.9% (28/962) in the control group. Thrombolytic therapy was associated with a statistically significant reduction of PE recurrence (OR: 0.50; 95% CI: 0.27–0.94, P = 0.03). No heterogeneity was detected (I² = 0%). No significant difference was found according to the thrombolytic regimen (P = 0.39) or the severity of PE (P = 0.33).

- **Major bleeding**: Major bleeding was reported in 12 studies involving 1,935 patients and was present in 9.9% (96/974) of patients allocated to thrombolytic therapy and 3.6% (35/961) in the control group. Thrombolytic treatment was associated with a significantly increased risk of major bleeding (OR: 2.91; 95% CI: 1.95–4.36, P < 0.0001). A low amount of heterogeneity was detected (I² = 25%).

	- Subgroup analysis did not show any differences between studies using invasive vs. non-invasive diagnostic procedures. Subgroup analysis based on the thrombolytic agent suggested a lower risk of major bleeding in studies using alteplase compared with tenecteplase. Nevertheless, this subgroup difference was not significant after exclusion of the study by Konstantinides et al. which used a more restrictive definition of major hemorrhage. Finally, the association between thrombolytic therapy and the risk of major bleeding was lower in studies using an upper age limit (OR: 1.13; 95% CI: 0.47–2.71) than in studies including older patients.

### Anticoagulant treatment for subsegmental pulmonary embolism [^111cwgSF]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Acute pulmonary embolism (PE) is a common cause of death, accounting for 50,000 to 200,000 deaths annually. It is the third most common cause of mortality among cardiovascular diseases, following coronary artery disease and stroke. The advent of multi-detector computed tomographic pulmonary angiography (CTPA) has enabled better assessment of PE by improving visualization of the peripheral pulmonary arteries, thereby increasing the diagnosis rate. Consequently, more cases of peripheral PEs, such as isolated subsegmental PE (SSPE) and incidental PE, have been identified.

These conditions are typically found in patients exhibiting few or none of the classic PE symptoms, such as hemoptysis, pleuritic pain, acute dyspnea, or circulatory collapse. However, in patients with reduced cardiopulmonary (C/P) reserve, classic PE symptoms can be present even with isolated SSPEs. Incidental SSPE often occurs in asymptomatic patients and is generally discovered through diagnostic imaging performed for other reasons, such as routine CT scans for cancer staging in oncologic patients.

Traditionally, all PEs are treated with anticoagulation in a similar manner, regardless of the location, number, and size of the thrombi. It has been suggested that many patients with SSPE might not benefit from such treatment, potentially increasing adverse events due to the unnecessary use of anticoagulants. Patients with isolated SSPE or incidental PE may present more benign clinical features compared to those with proximal PEs. However, the clinical significance and prognosis in these patients require further study to determine the necessity of anticoagulation therapy.

### Paradoxical embolus illustrating speed of action of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator in massive pulmonary embolism [^115tyGrv]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2007). Low credibility.

A case of a patient who presented with massive pulmonary embolism (PE) requiring thrombolysis with alteplase is reported. The subsequent presence of a patent foramen ovale and paradoxical embolism clinically demonstrated the speed of action of the recombinant tissue plasminogen activator. The advantage of this class of medication when considering the treatment options for a PE in an acute setting is highlighted.

### Systemic thrombolytic therapy for acute pulmonary embolism: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^113AdkvK]. European Heart Journal (2015). Low credibility.

The benefits of thrombolytic therapy must be weighed against the risk of haemorrhagic complications. The rate of major bleeding complications reported in our meta-analysis for patients allocated to thrombolytic therapy (9.9%) is similar to that reported by Wan et al. (9.1%) and Dong et al. (10.4%). In contrast to our meta-analysis, these previous reports failed to demonstrate a significant association between thrombolytic therapy and major bleeding. This difference appears to result mainly from the inclusion of the PEITHO trial in our meta-analysis, which included more patients than all other studies together and a higher proportion of elderly patients with a higher bleeding risk. Interestingly, our subgroup analysis suggested a higher risk for both major bleeding and fatal or intracranial haemorrhage in patients treated with tenecteplase compared with those treated with alteplase, probably because two of the three studies using tenecteplase had the oldest populations of all 15 studies included in this meta-analysis. As also previously reported by others, the inclusion of older patients was associated with an increased risk of bleeding in our analysis.

Given the non-negligible risks of systemic thrombolytic treatment and the relatively low risk of early mortality among patients with acute PE, research has recently focused on the minimization of thrombolysis-related risks by dose reduction, a strategy of catheter-delivered, ultrasound-assisted administration of thrombolytic treatment, and the identification of intermediate-risk patients with a potentially favourable risk-to-benefit ratio.

### Anticoagulant impact on clinical outcomes of pulmonary embolism compared with thrombolytic therapy; meta-analysis [^116LiSJx]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). Low credibility.

The study's analysis of publication bias across various outcomes revealed consistent findings, with minimal indications of publication bias. For 30-day mortality, neither the rank correlation nor the regression test indicated funnel plot asymmetry (p = 0.6007 and p = 0.5915, respectively). Similarly, for 12-month mortality, the tests showed p-values of 0.8793 and 0.4034. In-hospital mortality had p-values of 0.5452 and 0.8580. Minor bleeding yielded p-values of 0.4454 and 0.1018, while major bleeding had p-values of 0.9524 and 0.5530.

For hospital stay, the tests indicated p-values of 0.5423 and 0.3350. Outcomes related to systemic thrombolytic treatment also showed nonsignificant p-values, with all-cause mortality at 0.2389 and 0.2432, and in-hospital mortality at 0.7614 and 0.6734. In rePE, the p-values were 1.0000 and 0.5315, and for clinical deterioration, they were 0.7726 and 0.4983. None of the studies showed extreme outliers or overly influential data points, indicating that the results across the studies are likely robust and not significantly impacted by publication bias.

### Thrombolysis in hemodynamically stable patients with acute pulmonary embolism: a meta-analysis [^112LeLUo]. Thrombosis Research (2014). Low credibility.

The role of thrombolysis in hemodynamically stable patients with acute pulmonary embolism (PE) remains controversial. We performed a meta-analysis of randomized trials to assess the effect of thrombolysis in these patients.

- **Materials and methods**: We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE for randomized studies comparing thrombolysis and heparin for the initial treatment of hemodynamically stable PE patients. Pooled odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. The number needed to harm (NNH) to cause a major bleeding (MB) or an intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) and the number needed to treat (NNT) to avoid one death were also calculated.

- **Results**: Eleven studies (1833 patients) were included: seven with rt-PA, three with tenecteplase, and one with urokinase. Patients randomized to thrombolysis had a significantly increased risk for MB (5.9% vs. 1.9%; OR 2.83, 95% CI 1.68–4.76, I2 18.7%), and an increased risk for ICH (1.74% vs. 0.6%; OR 2.36, 95% CI 0.98–5.71, I2 0%) and fatal bleeding (1.3% vs. 0.54%; OR 1.84, 95% CI 0.73–4.61, I2 0%). There was a non-significant reduction in all-cause death (1.74% vs. 2.51%; OR 0.68, 95% CI 0.37–1.26, I2 0%) and a significant reduction in recurrent PE (rePE) (1.1% vs. 2.5%; OR 0.44, 95% CI 0.21–0.92, I2 0%) in favor of thrombolysis compared with heparin. NNH to cause an MB or an ICH were 27 and 91 patients, respectively. NNT to avoid one death was 125 patients.

- **Conclusions**: Due to increased risk for MB and ICH with no evidence of reduction in mortality, thrombolysis should not be used for most normotensive PE patients.

### Grades of recommendation for antithrombotic agents: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines (8th edition) [^114SzgWv]. Chest (2008). Low credibility.

This chapter describes the system used by the American College of Chest Physicians to grade recommendations for antithrombotic and thrombolytic therapy as part of the Antithrombotic and Thrombolytic Therapy: American College of Chest Physicians Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines (8th Edition). Clinicians need to know if a recommendation is strong or weak, and the methodologic quality of the evidence underlying that recommendation.

- **Strength of a recommendation**: We determine the strength of a recommendation by considering the balance between the desirable effects of an intervention and the undesirable effects (incremental harms, burdens, and for select recommendations, costs). If the desirable effects outweigh the undesirable effects, we recommend that clinicians offer an intervention to typical patients. The uncertainty associated with the balance between the desirable and undesirable effects will determine the strength of recommendations. If we are confident that benefits do or do not outweigh harms, burden, and costs, we make a strong recommendation in our formulation, Grade 1. If we are less certain of the magnitude of the benefits and risks, burden, and costs, and thus their relative impact, we make a weaker Grade 2 recommendation.

- **Grading methodologic quality**: For grading methodologic quality, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) begin as high-quality evidence (designated by "A"), but quality can decrease to moderate ("B"), or low ("C") as a result of poor design and conduct of RCTs, imprecision, inconsistency of results, indirectness, or a high likelihood for reporting bias. Observational studies begin as low quality of.

### Safety and efficacy of reduced-dose versus full-dose alteplase for acute pulmonary embolism: A multicenter observational comparative effectiveness study [^112ZfSor]. Critical Care Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Systemic thrombolysis improves outcomes in patients with pulmonary embolism (PE) but is associated with the risk of hemorrhage. The data on the efficacy and safety of reduced-dose alteplase are limited. The study objective was to compare the characteristics, outcomes, and complications of patients with PE treated with full- or reduced-dose alteplase regimens.

- **Design**: Multicenter retrospective observational study.

- **Setting**: Tertiary care hospital and 15 community and academic centers within a large healthcare system.

- **Patients**: Hospitalized patients with PE treated with systemic alteplase.

- **Interventions**: None.

- **Measurements and main results**: Pre- and post-alteplase hemodynamic and respiratory variables, patient outcomes, and complications were compared. Propensity score (PS) weighting was used to adjust for imbalances of baseline characteristics between reduced- and full-dose patients. Separate analyses were performed using the unweighted and weighted cohorts. Ninety-eight patients were treated with a full-dose (100mg) and 186 with a reduced-dose (50mg) regimen. Following alteplase treatment, significant improvements in shock index, blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and supplemental oxygen requirements were observed in both groups. Hemorrhagic complications were lower with the reduced-dose compared with the full-dose regimen (13% vs. 24.5%, p = 0.014), and most were minor. Major extracranial hemorrhage occurred in 1.1% versus 6.1%, respectively (p = 0.022). Complications were associated with supratherapeutic levels of heparin anticoagulation in 37.5% of cases.

### Anticoagulant impact on clinical outcomes of pulmonary embolism compared with thrombolytic therapy; meta-analysis [^116CgzFF]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). Low credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a critical condition requiring effective management strategies. Several options are available, including thrombolytic therapy and anticoagulants.

- **Objective**: To assess the impact of thrombolytic therapy, either combined with anticoagulant (AC) or alone, versus AC alone on mortality, recurrence, clinical deterioration, bleeding, and hospital stay.

- **Method**: This study included 25 previously published studies from 1990 to 2023, with a total of 12,836 participants. Dichotomous and continuous analysis models were used to evaluate outcomes, with heterogeneity and publication bias tests applied. A random model was used for data analysis. Several databases, such as Ovid, PubMed, Cochrane Library, Google Scholar, and Embase, were searched for the identification and inclusion of studies.

- **Results**: For sub-massive PE, catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT) plus AC significantly reduced in-hospital, 30-day, and 12-month mortality compared to AC alone (odds ratio (OR) of -0.99, 95% CI [-1.32 to -0.66]), with an increased major bleeding risk but no difference in minor bleeding or hospital stay (OR = 0.46, 95% CI [-0.03 to 0.96]). For acute intermediate PE, systemic thrombolytic therapy did not affect all-cause or in-hospital mortality but increased minor bleeding, reduced recurrent PE, and prevented clinical deterioration. The heterogeneity of different models in the study varied from 0% to 37.9%.

- **Conclusion**: The addition of CDT to AC improves mortality outcomes for sub-massive PE but raises the risk of major bleeding. Systemic thrombolytic therapy reduces recurrence and clinical deterioration.

### Successful resuscitation of a patient with acute massive pulmonary embolism using emergent embolectomy [^111oTQQ4]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

Acute massive pulmonary embolism is associated with a high mortality rate. Prompt diagnosis and treatment are mandatory for a successful outcome. Although thrombolysis is effective, it is associated with a high rate of bleeding complications. This report describes the use of emergent pulmonary embolectomy as an effective and aggressive therapeutic approach to a massive saddle pulmonary embolism in a 66-year-old woman. With the application of specific surgical techniques and good interdisciplinary cooperation, pulmonary embolectomy may serve as more than a last resort for the management of this clinically unstable and dangerous condition.

### Tenecteplase: expanding horizons in thrombolytic therapy across various clinical indications [^112eE52F]. Heart (2025). High credibility.

Intravenous thrombolytics remain the mainstay of treatment for ischaemic stroke and retain importance for selected patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction and pulmonary embolism. Pharmacological and practical advantages of the fibrinolytic tenecteplase have recently led to a widespread shift in ischaemic stroke management. Meta-analysis of randomised trials demonstrated superiority of tenecteplase over alteplase in achieving excellent functional outcome after stroke (no disability). Trials have also extended the time window for thrombolytics in stroke to 24 hours, provided imaging demonstrates salvageable brain tissue.

Although endovascular therapy is the most effective treatment for large vessel occlusion stroke, access remains limited to major metropolitan centres in developed nations. Trials suggest that thrombolytics add value, even in patients receiving endovascular therapy, and for many patients globally, intravenous thrombolytics are the only accessible reperfusion treatment. Tenecteplase is established as the preferred thrombolytic for selected patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction, generally reserved for patients who cannot rapidly access percutaneous intervention following first medical contact. Notably, the dose used is twice that for stroke. Pre-hospital delivery of tenecteplase by paramedics is an important strategy in rural and remote areas.

While patients with high-risk pulmonary embolism benefit from systemic thrombolysis, adjunctive tenecteplase in intermediate-risk pulmonary embolism has been associated with increased risk of major bleed.

### Reduced-dose tenecteplase in high-risk pulmonary embolism [^114gMrPW]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a venous thromboembolic disease occurring when thrombi detach and embolize to pulmonary arteries, causing substantial morbidity and mortality in older adults yearly. In patients experiencing hemodynamic compromise, systemically administered thrombolytic therapy followed by anticoagulation over anticoagulation alone is recommended for initial management.

- **Case report**: This report describes the successful treatment of a patient over 90 years of age presenting to the emergency department with an acute, high-risk PE who received low-dose, systemically administered tenecteplase followed by systemic anticoagulation with unfractionated heparin. The patient was initiated on norepinephrine 0.5 µg/kg/min for hemodynamic support. They were administered a reduced dose of tenecteplase (17.5 mg or 0.37 mg/kg) bolus followed by unfractionated heparin and subsequent transfer to the medical intensive care unit. At 1 hour post-tenecteplase, norepinephrine was decreased to 0.2 µg/kg/min. At 14 hours post-tenecteplase, the norepinephrine requirement was minimal at 0.02 µg/kg/min and resolved with extubation 15 hours post-tenecteplase. The patient did not develop any clinically significant bleeding and was discharged to an acute rehabilitation facility on hospital day 7.

Available evidence suggests positive outcomes and dosing guidance for low-dose alteplase for PE treatment, though at the time of this report, the authors identified a gap in existing literature surrounding the same concept with reduced-dose tenecteplase.

### Thrombolytic therapy for acute pulmonary embolism: A critical appraisal [^112czDLD]. Chest (2009). Low credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a prevalent condition that may account for over 300,000 deaths annually in the United States alone. Although thrombolytics have been studied as a treatment for acute PE since the 1960s, only 11 randomized controlled trials have compared thrombolytic therapy to conventional anticoagulation, with a small number of patients included in these trials. Many studies confirm that thrombolytic therapy leads to rapid improvement in hemodynamic aberrations associated with PE, and this approach to massive PE with cardiogenic shock is a guideline-based practice.

It is widely accepted that acute PE without associated right ventricular (RV) dysfunction or hemodynamic instability can be readily managed with standard anticoagulation. The appropriate therapy for submassive PE, which is PE associated with RV dysfunction but preserved systemic arterial blood pressure, remains an area of contention. Definitive data proving a mortality benefit in this setting are lacking. Further efforts at risk stratification may better determine who is in need of aggressive therapy.

This article reviews historical aspects of and evidence for thrombolytic therapy in acute PE, with specific attention to bleeding risk and data regarding hemodynamic parameters and mortality. We also discuss risk stratification techniques and propose a clinical algorithm for the incorporation of thrombolytic therapy.

### All contraindications to thrombolysis for life-threatening pulmonary embolus should be considered relative [^1137M9zX]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Low credibility.

Acute massive pulmonary embolism (PE) can be fatal; however, timely thrombolytic therapy can be life-saving. Guidelines advocate the use of thrombolysis for massive PE in patients with an acceptable bleeding-risk profile. Nonetheless, estimating what constitutes an acceptable bleeding risk in those with life-threatening PE is a clinical challenge, and even contraindications considered 'absolute' may present lesser risk than leaving PE untreated.

We discuss the case of a 77-year-old man who received thrombolysis for a massive PE four weeks following admission with a significant intracerebral bleed. There was rapid resolution of hypotension and hypoxia, and he survived to be discharged home. This case illustrates that no potential therapy should be discounted in patients faced with acute life-threatening PE. Decisions to thrombolyse patients with traditional contraindications — even those considered absolute — must be taken by clinicians able to weigh relative risks.

### Clinical outcomes in patients with acute pulmonary embolism undergoing ultrasound-assisted catheter-directed thrombolysis [^111m67d8]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). High credibility.

Although there is ongoing discussion on selecting the optimal reperfusion strategy for patients with acute pulmonary embolism, the ERASE PE trial provides real-world evidence supporting the use of ultrasound-assisted thrombolysis (USAT) in well-selected patients with intermediate-high and high-risk acute pulmonary embolism. A standardized USAT protocol with low-dose rt-PA effectively reduced right ventricular overload, as assessed with mean pulmonary artery pressure, in the majority of patients. It also had low rates of periprocedural complications. Rates of all-cause mortality were 3.2% during the in-hospital course and 3.8% at 30 days, respectively, comparable to the literature and previous studies investigating the effectiveness and safety of USAT for acute pulmonary embolism.

The SEATTLE II (Submassive and Massive Pulmonary Embolism Treatment With Ultrasound Accelerated Thrombolysis Therapy) Study had in-hospital and 30-day mortality rates of 2.0% and 2.7%, respectively, whereas OPTALYSE (Study of the Optimum Duration of Acoustic Pulse Thrombolysis Procedure in the Treatment of Acute Submassive Pulmonary Embolism) presented in-hospital mortality rates as low as 1%. The small difference in mortality might be explained by the risk differences between the studied patient populations and the obvious differences in the treatment protocol: ERASE PE had high-risk patients at 18% and intermediate-high at 79%, SEATTLE II had high-risk at 20.7% and intermediate-high at 79.3%, whereas OPTALYSE reported intermediate-high at 79% and intermediate-low at 21%. ERASE PE followed the treatment protocol of the ULTIMA (Ultrasound Accelerated Thrombolysis of Pulmonary Embolism) randomized clinical trial, administering 20 mg of rt-PA over 15 hours via USAT.

### Massive pulmonary embolism in pregnancy treated with catheter fragmentation and local thrombolysis [^113b4RAR]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2005). Low credibility.

Catheter-directed thromboembolus fragmentation and thrombolysis have been successfully used for the treatment of pulmonary embolism with hemodynamic decompensation in nonpregnant patients, but information on its use during pregnancy is limited. We report successful treatment of massive bilateral pulmonary emboli in the third trimester of pregnancy.

- **Case**: A 29-year-old multigravida at 30 weeks of gestation presented with dyspnea, chest pain, heart palpitations, and syncope. A computed tomographic angiogram demonstrated massive bilateral central pulmonary emboli. Despite heparin and oxygen therapy, aggressive fluid resuscitation, and pressor treatment, hypotension persisted, and there were prolonged, deep fetal heart rate decelerations. Emergency percutaneous pulmonary artery catheter thrombus fragmentation, followed by local infusion of tissue plasminogen activator, was performed. The patient recovered rapidly and was discharged from the hospital on subcutaneous low-molecular-weight heparin. She was delivered of a normal, healthy infant at term.

- **Conclusion**: Catheter-directed mechanical fragmentation and local thrombolytic infusion therapy is a treatment option for pulmonary embolism with hemodynamic decompensation in pregnancy. The advantages are rapid clot lysis with consequent return of normal hemodynamics and uterine perfusion and avoidance of systemic thrombolytics and associated risk of bleeding complications.

### Heparin plus alteplase compared with heparin alone in patients with submassive pulmonary embolism [^117MtHKZ]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2002). High credibility.

Use of thrombolytic agents in the treatment of hemodynamically stable patients with acute submassive pulmonary embolism remains controversial.

- **Methods**: We conducted a study of patients with acute pulmonary embolism and pulmonary hypertension or right ventricular dysfunction but without arterial hypotension or shock. The patients were randomly assigned in a double-blind fashion to receive heparin plus 100 mg of alteplase or heparin plus placebo over a period of two hours. The primary endpoint was in-hospital death or clinical deterioration requiring an escalation of treatment, which was defined as catecholamine infusion, secondary thrombolysis, endotracheal intubation, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, or emergency surgical embolectomy or thrombus fragmentation by catheter.

- **Results**: Of 256 patients enrolled, 118 were randomly assigned to receive heparin plus alteplase and 138 to receive heparin plus placebo. The incidence of the primary endpoint was significantly higher in the heparin-plus-placebo group than in the heparin-plus-alteplase group (P = 0.006), and the probability of 30-day event-free survival (according to Kaplan-Meier analysis) was higher in the heparin-plus-alteplase group (P = 0.005). This difference was due to the higher incidence of treatment escalation in the heparin-plus-placebo group (24.6 percent vs. 10.2 percent, P = 0.004), since mortality was low in both groups (3.4 percent in the heparin-plus-alteplase group and 2.2 percent in the heparin-plus-placebo group, P = 0.71). Treatment with heparin plus placebo was associated with almost three times.

Regarding the medical management for pulmonary embolism, specifically with respect to aspirin therapy post-anticoagulation, the ASH 2020 guidelines recommend considering the suspension of aspirin over continuing it for the duration of anticoagulation therapy. This applies to patients with pulmonary embolism who have stable cardiovascular disease and are initiating anticoagulation, having previously taken aspirin for cardiovascular risk modification.

### Anticoagulant impact on clinical outcomes of pulmonary embolism compared with thrombolytic therapy; meta-analysis [^115fMXxQ]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). Low credibility.

- **Systemic thrombolytic versus AC alone**: For the management of acute intermediate PE, systemic thrombolytic therapy was compared to AC alone. Analyzing seven studies, the results showed no significant difference in all‐cause mortality between the systemic thrombolytic therapy group and the AC group (p = 0.1851, OR = -0.40, 95% CI [-1.00 to 0.19]), with negligible heterogeneity (I² = 0.0%). Additionally, nine studies indicated no significant difference in in‐hospital mortality between the two groups (p = 0.4336, OR = -0.26, 95% CI [-0.92 to 0.40]), with negligible heterogeneity (I² = 0.0%).

In terms of bleeding events, four studies revealed a significant increase in minor bleeding incidents with systemic thrombolytic therapy compared to AC alone (p < 0.0001, OR = 1.63, 95% CI [1.29 to 1.97]), with negligible heterogeneity (I² = 0.0002%). Conversely, nine studies showed no significant difference in major bleeding between the two groups (p = 0.1142, OR = 0.71, 95% CI [-0.17 to 1.58]), although there was moderate heterogeneity (I² = 33.5%).

The analysis also examined the recurrence of PE. Six studies indicated a significant reduction in rePE with systemic thrombolytic therapy compared to AC alone (p < 0.0001, OR = -1.97, 95% CI [-2.77 to -1.17]), with negligible heterogeneity (I² = 0.0%). Moreover, seven studies demonstrated a significant reduction in clinical deterioration with systemic thrombolytic therapy compared to AC alone (p < 0.0001, OR = -1.30, 95% CI [-1.70 to -0.90]), also with negligible heterogeneity (I² = 0.0%).

### Effectiveness and cost effectiveness of thrombolysis in patients with acute pulmonary embolism [^111gsBs9]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Acute pulmonary embolism is a common, life-threatening cardiopulmonary disorder with a high mortality rate within the first three months of diagnosis. Although prompt anticoagulation remains the mainstay of therapy for patients with pulmonary embolism, the clinical utility and cost-effectiveness of systemic thrombolysis is a subject of debate.

- **Recent findings**: Pulmonary embolism, characterized by cardiogenic shock and hypotension, is considered 'massive' and is an accepted indication for thrombolysis. However, catheter-directed embolectomy, with or without local lytic therapy, is preferred in centers with the requisite expertise. Acute right ventricular dysfunction is a poor prognostic indicator in patients with pulmonary embolism. The most recent randomized controlled trial of systemic thrombolysis in patients with submassive pulmonary embolism and right ventricular dysfunction demonstrated that, compared with heparin alone, the combination of alteplase and heparin reduced the risk of clinical deterioration necessitating treatment escalation, though it did not reduce the risk of death. A subsequent cost-effectiveness analysis concluded that alteplase and heparin were slightly less effective and marginally more expensive than heparin alone in this patient population.

- **Summary**: Current evidence does not support the use of thrombolytic agents in most hemodynamically stable patients with right ventricular dysfunction. However, improved methods of risk stratification may identify subgroups of patients at high risk of death who might benefit from systemic thrombolysis.

### Systemic thrombolytic therapy for acute pulmonary embolism: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^1159wdT8]. European Heart Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Search strategy, study selection, data extraction, and analysis were performed according to a predefined protocol.

- **Search strategy**: Two authors (C.M. and G.J.) systematically searched Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Registry using the following keywords: (pulmonary embolism AND [thrombolysis OR thrombolytic therapy OR streptokinase OR urokinase OR tenecteplase OR desmoteplase OR reteplase OR tissue plasminogen activator]). The detailed search strategy is available and was last updated on 16 February 2014. To ensure a comprehensive literature search, we examined reference lists from retrieved articles and reference literature (guidelines and systematic reviews) and questioned experts in pulmonary embolism for possible published or unpublished missing studies.

- **Study selection and data extraction**: We included randomized controlled trials comparing a thrombolytic agent — streptokinase, urokinase, recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (alteplase), desmoteplase, reteplase, or tenecteplase — administered systemically by the intravenous route and heparin (unfractionated or low-molecular-weight heparin) with heparin alone in patients with acute pulmonary embolism. Studies comparing two regimens of thrombolytic therapy and those using mechanical thrombectomy along with thrombolytic treatment or local catheter-delivered thrombolysis were excluded. Two investigators (C.M. and G.J.) independently evaluated studies for possible inclusion. Non-relevant studies were excluded based on title and abstract. For potentially relevant studies, full text was obtained for further assessment.

### Revisiting ultrasound-assisted catheter-directed thrombolysis for pulmonary embolism: Insights from new data [^115sKuZf]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). High credibility.

Catheter-directed thrombolysis has historically been a primary treatment for intermediate-high- and high-risk pulmonary embolism (PE), but the past decade has seen a paradigm shift toward mechanical thrombectomy. This shift is driven by advancing technology, emerging clinical trial data, and a focus on reducing bleeding risks, particularly in high-risk patients. Recent data from the ERASE PE (Bern Acute Pulmonary Embolism Registry) study in this issue of the Journal of the American Heart Association (JAHA) revisits the role of ultrasound-assisted catheter-directed thrombolysis (USAT), providing a contemporary perspective on its efficacy and safety in managing PE.

The study highlights USAT's ability to significantly reduce right ventricular (RV) overload and pulmonary artery pressure, with an 88% success rate. The mean reduction in the RV/left ventricular ratio by 0.37 and an 8.5 mm Hg drop in pulmonary artery pressure supports USAT as an effective intervention for improving cardiac function, which is critical for stabilizing patients who are hemodynamically compromised. These findings are consistent with prior studies like ULTIMA (Ultrasound Accelerated Thrombolysis of Pulmonary Embolism) and SEATTLE II (A Prospective, Single-Arm, Multicentre Trial of Ultrasound-Facilitated, Low-Dose Fibrinolysis for Acute Massive and Submassive Pulmonary Embolism), reinforcing USAT's role in reducing mortality risk by alleviating RV strain.

### Thrombolytic therapy for pulmonary embolism [^116kNqEP]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Thrombolytic therapy is usually reserved for patients with clinically serious or massive pulmonary embolism (PE). Evidence suggests that thrombolytic agents may dissolve blood clots more rapidly than heparin and might reduce the death rate associated with PE. However, there are concerns about the possible risk of adverse effects of thrombolytic therapy, such as major or minor haemorrhages. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2006.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effectiveness and safety of thrombolytic therapy in patients with acute PE.

- **Search strategy**: For this update, the Cochrane Peripheral Vascular Diseases Review Group searched their Specialised Register (last searched April 2009) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library (last searched Issue 2, 2009). We also searched individual trial collections and private databases, along with bibliographies of relevant articles. Relevant medical journals were handsearched.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared thrombolytic therapy with placebo, heparin, or surgical intervention in patients with acute PE. We did not include trials comparing two different thrombolytic agents or different doses of the same thrombolytic drug.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two authors assessed the eligibility and quality of trials and extracted data.

- **Main results**: We included eight trials, with a total of 679 patients, in this review. Results between thrombolytics compared with heparin alone or placebo and heparin were similar.

### Rivaroxaban plus percutaneous catheter-directed treatment for a patient with massive pulmonary embolism and colporrhagia [^115cAHeS]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Massive pulmonary embolism (PE) is defined by acute PE with sustained systemic arterial hypotension that is below 90 mm Hg for at least 15 minutes or requires inotropic agents. For patients with absolute contraindications to thrombolysis, interventional treatment requires the removal of obstructing thrombi from the main pulmonary arteries to facilitate right ventricular (RV) recovery and improve symptoms and survival. For patients with acute PE, anticoagulation is recommended, with the objective of preventing both early death and reSymptomatic or fatal venous thromboembolism (VTE). Rivaroxaban, an oral factor Xa inhibitor and a new oral anticoagulant, shows effective anticoagulation within hours of administration. It has a fixed-dose regimen and requires no laboratory monitoring. However, the efficacy and safety of rivaroxaban plus catheter-directed treatment for massive PE and bleeding are unknown. This case demonstrated that a combination of catheter-directed treatment and rivaroxaban was safe and effective for the treatment of severe PE with vaginal bleeding.

### Current controversies in thrombolytic use in acute pulmonary embolism [^1139oRAt]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Acute pulmonary embolism (PE) has an annual incidence of 100,000 cases in the United States and is divided into three categories: nonmassive, submassive, and massive. Several studies have evaluated the use of thrombolytics in submassive and massive PE.

Our aim was to provide emergency physicians with an updated review of the controversy about the use of thrombolytics in submassive and massive PE.

- **Discussion**: Nonmassive PE is defined as PE in the setting of no signs of right ventricular strain (echocardiogram or biomarker) and hemodynamic stability. Submassive PE is defined as evidence of right ventricular strain with lack of hemodynamic instability. Massive PE occurs with occlusive thromboembolism that causes hemodynamic instability. Thrombolysis is warranted in patients with massive PE. Thrombolytic use in submassive PE with signs of right ventricular strain or damage presents a quandary for physicians. Several recent studies have evaluated the use of thrombolytics in patients with submassive PE. These studies have inconsistent definitions of submassive PE, evaluate differing primary outcomes, and use different treatment protocols with thrombolytics and anticoagulation agents. Although significant study heterogeneity exists, thrombolytics can improve long-term outcomes, with decreased bleeding risk with half-dose thrombolytics and catheter-directed treatments. Major bleeding significantly increases in patients over age 65 years. The risks and benefits of thrombolytic treatment — primarily improved long-term outcomes — should be considered on a case-by-case basis.

### Systemic thrombolytic therapy for acute pulmonary embolism: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1177PUjw]. European Heart Journal (2015). Low credibility.

All 15 studies, encompassing a total of 2057 patients, reported early (≤ 30 days) all-cause mortality rates. The mortality rate was 2.3% (24 out of 1033) in the thrombolysis group and 3.9% (40 out of 1024) in the control group. Thrombolytic therapy was linked to a significant reduction in early mortality with a pooled OR of 0.59 (95% CI: 0.36–0.96, P = 0.03). No heterogeneity was observed among the studies (I² = 0%). Excluding studies with high-risk pulmonary embolism (PE), the treatment effect remained similar, but statistical significance was lost (OR: 0.64; 95% CI: 0.35–1.17).

The pooled ORs were comparable in studies with high-risk PE (OR: 0.48; 95% CI: 0.2–1.15) and in studies with only intermediate-risk PE (OR: 0.42; 95% CI: 0.17–1.03), whereas the pooled OR was close to one in studies with both low- and intermediate-risk PE (OR: 0.96; 95% CI: 0.41–2.24). Subgroup analysis based on the thrombolytic regimen did not reveal any significant differences: alteplase (OR: 0.64; 95% CI: 0.29–1.41), tenecteplase (OR: 0.65; 95% CI: 0.26–1.64), or older thrombolytics (OR: 0.48; 95% CI: 0.20–1.15), with a P-value of 0.86.

### Revisiting ultrasound-assisted catheter-directed thrombolysis for pulmonary embolism: Insights from new data [^1166QwZH]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Low credibility.

High-risk patients with PE demonstrated a four-fold increase in periprocedural death compared with intermediate-high-risk patients, highlighting the challenges of treating massive PE. Even with rapid reperfusion, the hemodynamic collapse and RV failure often seen in these patients may require a combination of therapies, such as USAT paired with mechanical thrombectomy, to improve outcomes.

The ERASE PE study lacks long-term follow-up data on outcomes such as chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension, rePE, and postdischarge death. This limits the ability to assess the durability of USAT's benefits beyond the acute phase. Furthermore, without a direct comparator group, it remains unclear how USAT fares against other treatments like anticoagulation, systemic thrombolysis, or mechanical thrombectomy.

Ongoing trials such as HI-PEITHO (a randomized trial of ultrasound-facilitated), catheter-directed, thrombolysis versus anticoagulation for acute intermediate-high risk pulmonary embolism and PEERLESS will help define USAT's place within the PE treatment landscape. HI-PEITHO compares USAT to anticoagulation, while PEERLESS evaluates the FlowTriever system (mechanical thrombectomy) against USAT. These trials will be crucial in determining whether mechanical embolectomy, which eliminates thrombolytic-associated bleeding risks, should be prioritized over USAT.

Moreover, findings from the SUNSET-sPE (standard versus ultrasound-assisted catheter thrombolysis for submassive pulmonary embolism) trial raise questions about the added benefit of ultrasound in USAT compared with…

### Management dilemmas in acute pulmonary embolism [^111qSbwW]. Thorax (2014). Low credibility.

The suggested approaches are based on a review of the available evidence and guidelines, as well as our clinical experience. For many of these dilemmas, the evidence base is not substantial and may be compromised by reporting bias. Management for an individual patient will require a clinical assessment of the risks and benefits, and will also depend on the local availability of therapeutic interventions.

### Systemic thrombolytic therapy for acute pulmonary embolism: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114CJu1K]. European Heart Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Thrombolytic therapy induces faster clot dissolution than anticoagulation in patients with acute pulmonary embolism (PE) but is associated with an increased risk of hemorrhage. We reviewed the risks and benefits of thrombolytic therapy in the management of patients with acute PE.

- **Methods and results**: We systematically reviewed randomized controlled studies comparing systemic thrombolytic therapy plus anticoagulation with anticoagulation alone in patients with acute PE. Fifteen trials involving 2057 patients were included in our meta-analysis. Compared with heparin, thrombolytic therapy was associated with a significant reduction in overall mortality (OR: 0.59, 95% CI: 0.36–0.96). This reduction was not statistically significant after the exclusion of studies including high-risk PE (OR: 0.64, 95% CI: 0.35–1.17). Thrombolytic therapy was associated with a significant reduction in the combined endpoint of death or treatment escalation (OR: 0.34, 95% CI: 0.22–0.53), PE-related mortality (OR: 0.29; 95% CI: 0.14–0.60), and PE recurrence (OR: 0.50; 95% CI: 0.27–0.94). However, major hemorrhage (OR: 2.91, 95% CI: 1.95–4.36) and fatal or intracranial bleeding (OR: 3.18, 95% CI: 1.25–8.11) were significantly more frequent among patients receiving thrombolysis.

- **Conclusions**: Thrombolytic therapy reduces total mortality, PE recurrence, and PE-related mortality in patients with acute PE. The decrease in overall mortality is, however, not significant in hemodynamically stable patients with acute PE. Thrombolytic therapy is associated with an increase in major and fatal or intracranial hemorrhage.

### Catheter-directed thrombolysis with the Endowave system in the treatment of acute massive pulmonary embolism: A retrospective multicenter case series [^115suZPb]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2008). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of thrombolysis with the EndoWave peripheral infusion system in treating patients with massive pulmonary embolism (PE) compared to those treated with catheter-directed thrombolysis.

- **Materials and methods**: Ten patients (five men and five women; age range, 31–85 years; mean age, 54.20 years) with massive acute PE (17 lesions) were treated with ultrasonography (US)-assisted catheter-directed thrombolysis using the Endowave system. All patients had hypoxia and dyspnea, and none had contraindications for thrombolysis. Angiographic findings, duration of lysis, dose of thrombolytics used, and procedural complications were recorded. The thrombolytics used included urokinase, tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA), and Reteplase.

- **Results**: Complete thrombus removal was achieved in 13 of the 17 lesions (76%), near-complete thrombolysis in three lesions (18%), and partial thrombolysis in one lesion (6%). The mean time of thrombolysis was 24.76 hours ± 8.44 (median, 24 hours). The mean dose of tPA used for the Endowave group was 0.88 mg/h ± 0.19 (13 lesions).

- **Conclusions**: US-assisted catheter-directed thrombolysis is an effective method for treating massive thrombolysis. It has the potential to shorten the time of lysis and lower the dose of thrombolytics.

### Low-dose urokinase in massive pulmonary embolism when standard thrombolysis is contraindicated [^111CihFK]. Chest (2009). Low credibility.

When acute massive pulmonary embolism is life-threatening, thrombolysis could be a therapeutic option. However, lysis may be contraindicated when the risk of bleeding is high. We report on two patients who had massive pulmonary emboli complicated by severe hypotension, justifying thrombolytic treatment. Nevertheless, recent surgery in the first patient and a fresh hemorrhagic duodenal ulcer in the second patient precluded thrombolytic treatment at the usual dosage. Therefore, prolonged lysis with low-dose urokinase (1,000 units/kg/h) was initiated. After a few hours, the patients became hemodynamically stable, and inotrope/vasopressor doses could be reduced and stopped. No major bleeding was observed. Consequently, prolonged thrombolysis with low-dose urokinase could be an alternative approach to therapy in patients with massive pulmonary emboli when recommended thrombolytic dosages are contraindicated.

### A positive outcome in patient with massive acute pulmonary embolism and right atrial mobile thrombus fragmented during thrombolysis: A serial echocardiographic examination [^115BBrd8]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

This case report presents a patient with acute, massive pulmonary embolism diagnosed by transthoracic echocardiography, with the mobile thrombus visualized in the right atrium. During the thrombolytic therapy, the thrombus fragmented and migrated to the pulmonary artery, causing a rapid transient worsening of the patient's clinical status. The continuation of thrombolysis led to the gradual improvement of the patient's condition. This case highlights the importance of serial echocardiographic examinations in revealing right heart masses, right ventricle overloading, and the effectiveness of the treatment.

### Clinical outcomes in patients with acute pulmonary embolism undergoing ultrasound-assisted catheter-directed thrombolysis [^111o8V27]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). High credibility.

Among unstable patients with massive (high-risk) acute pulmonary embolism (PE), immediate reperfusion is commonly achieved with thrombolytic therapy by intravenous injection of a plasminogen activator (e.g. recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator [rt-PA]). Systemic thrombolysis, however, is associated with a significant risk of bleeding in up to 20% of treated individuals, including rates of intracranial hemorrhage between 2% and 5%. Appropriate therapy is often withheld due to the anticipated risk of bleeding. Submassive (intermediate-risk) PE is characterized by right ventricular (RV) dysfunction or cardiac ischemia. Although early mortality rates are as high as 10.9% in this patient population, clinical practice guidelines recommend anticoagulation rather than thrombolytic reperfusion therapy in stable patients due to the associated hazard of life-threatening bleeding.

Catheter-directed therapies for PE were mainly studied in hemodynamically stable patients, and may avert the risk of RV overload in intermediate-risk patients and minimize the risk of major bleeding. Upon interventional techniques, catheter-directed thrombolysis using ultrasound-enhanced technology, the EkoSonic Endovascular System (EKOS) provides most of the evidence supporting an early treatment strategy for PE. Although numerous single-arm studies have evaluated the safety and effectiveness of this device, overall patient numbers are still low.

Therefore, we aimed to investigate the benefits and risks of ultrasound-assisted catheter-directed thrombolysis (USAT) in a large patient population.

### Simultaneous thrombolysis and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for acute massive pulmonary emboli [^111yWkqL]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2021). Low credibility.

Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used in patients with circulatory collapse or extremely unstable hemodynamics caused by acute massive pulmonary embolism (PE). The effectiveness of simultaneous thrombolytic therapy has been rarely investigated in these patients after being stabilized with ECMO.

- **Methods**: From January 2008 to December 2018, consecutive patients with acute massive PE requiring ECMO support in a tertiary medical center were included for retrospective analysis.

- **Results**: Thirteen patients with PE underwent ECMO implantation and received subsequent thrombolytic therapy as a definitive treatment for PE. All patients survived their ECMO courses to a successful decannulation, with a mean ECMO support duration of 6.23 ± 4.69 days. Eleven patients (84.62%) survived to hospital discharge. All survivors were alive during follow-up, although 2 patients (18.2%) had permanent dysfunctional neurologic complications. Major bleeding complications occurred in 4 patients (30.77%), whereas no patient had intracranial hemorrhage. Systemic thrombolysis showed comparable outcomes with catheter-directed thrombolysis in our patients who underwent ECMO.

- **Conclusions**: Thrombolysis-based therapeutic strategy under ECMO could be a relatively safe and effective definitive treatment for patients with acute massive PE, even for those who were resuscitated. Bleeding complications remain a major concern and should be monitored and managed immediately.

### Anticoagulant treatment for subsegmental pulmonary embolism [^115crr11]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Low credibility.

Acute pulmonary embolism (PE) is a common cause of death, accounting for 50,000 to 200,000 deaths annually. It is the third most common cause of mortality among cardiovascular diseases, after coronary artery disease and stroke. The advent of multi-detector computed tomographic pulmonary angiography (CTPA) has allowed better assessment of PE regarding visualization of the peripheral pulmonary arteries, increasing its rate of diagnosis. More cases of peripheral PEs, such as isolated subsegmental PE (SSPE) and incidental PE, have thereby been identified.

These two conditions are usually found in patients with few or none of the classic PE symptoms, such as haemoptysis or pleuritic pain, acute dyspnoea, or circulatory collapse. However, in patients with reduced cardiopulmonary reserve, classic PE symptoms can be found with isolated SSPEs. Incidental SSPE is found casually in asymptomatic patients, usually by diagnostic imaging performed for other reasons, for example, routine CT for cancer staging in oncology patients.

Traditionally, all PEs are anticoagulated in a similar manner independent of their location, number, and size of the thrombi. It has been suggested that many patients with SSPE may be treated without benefit, increasing adverse events by a possible unnecessary use of anticoagulants. Patients with isolated SSPE or incidental PE may have a more benign clinical presentation compared to those with proximal PEs. However, the clinical significance in patients, and their prognosis, needs to be studied to evaluate whether anticoagulation therapy is required.

### Efficacy of thrombolytic agents in the treatment of pulmonary embolism [^112s9uub]. The European Respiratory Journal (2005). Low credibility.

Recent guidelines recommend bolus-dose alteplase for treating massive pulmonary embolism (PE). However, the safest and most effective treatment remains unknown. In the present study, a meta-analysis of published studies assessing alteplase infusion, bolus-dose alteplase, and streptokinase was conducted. The outcome measures included objective assessment of thrombolysis, all-cause mortality, deaths due to initial PE, major bleeding episodes, rePE, and morbidity.

A total of 26 studies were identified; however, only two comparative studies of alteplase infusion versus either bolus-dose alteplase or streptokinase were found. The meta-analysis revealed no significant difference among the three regimens, although it was compromised by a paucity of data. Crude analysis of aggregated data on thrombolytic efficacy from all studies indicated that alteplase infusion was more effective than bolus-dose alteplase (relative risk (RR): 1.95; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.19–3.2), while streptokinase was more effective than alteplase infusion (RR: 1.27; 95% CI: 1.09–1.47).

Alteplase infusion had a lower mortality rate due to the initial PE compared to both bolus-dose alteplase and streptokinase (RR: 0.16; 95% CI: 0.05–0.59 and RR: 0.13; 95% CI: 0.04–0.46, respectively). In conclusion, this evidence suggests that the three thrombolytic agents may vary in efficacy. However, large-scale randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm these results.

### Thrombolytic therapy for pulmonary embolism [^116r6Un1]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Thrombolytic therapy is usually reserved for patients with clinically serious or massive pulmonary embolism (PE). Evidence suggests that thrombolytic agents may dissolve blood clots more rapidly than heparin and might reduce the death rate associated with PE. However, there are still concerns about the possible risk of adverse effects of thrombolytic therapy, such as major or minor hemorrhages.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effectiveness and safety of thrombolytic therapy in patients with acute PE.

- **Search strategy**: We sought trials through the Cochrane Peripheral Vascular Diseases Group's Specialised Register (January 18, 2006), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 1, 2006), MEDLINE (January 1966 to December 2004), EMBASE, CINAHL, LILACS, and SCISEARCH (all November 2004). We also searched individual trial collections and private databases, along with bibliographies of relevant articles. Relevant medical journals were handsearched. The most recent search was on February 6, 2006.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials that compared thrombolytic therapy with placebo or heparin or surgical intervention in patients with acute PE were included. We did not include trials comparing two different thrombolytic agents or different doses of the same thrombolytic drug.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two authors (DB and WQ) assessed the eligibility and quality of trials and extracted data.

- **Main results**: Results were similar between thrombolytics compared with heparin alone or placebo and heparin in terms of the death rate.

### Systemic thrombolytic therapy for acute pulmonary embolism: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^111dAsX9]. European Heart Journal (2015). High credibility.

Evidence from currently available randomized trials suggests that thrombolytic treatment reduces overall mortality in patients with acute pulmonary embolism (PE). Although the estimated treatment effect corresponds to a 41% relative risk reduction in overall mortality, the definitive benefit of thrombolytic therapy for patients with acute PE remains unestablished.

This observation deserves several comments:

- **Robustness of primary result**: The significance of our primary result was limited, as statistical significance was lost after excluding the study by Jerjes-Sanchez et al. This small, open-label trial included only patients with high-risk PE and was limited by gross imbalance between groups. The four patients allocated to heparin treatment were admitted for an acute episode of unstable PE despite previous therapeutic anticoagulation. Nevertheless, even after excluding this trial, a trend towards decreased all-cause mortality was observed (OR: 0.65; 95% CI: 0.39–1.08).
- **Early mortality considerations**: Early mortality is relatively uncommon among patients with acute PE, particularly those with non-high-risk PE. Considering a mortality of 3.9% in the control group, a 41% relative risk reduction would lead to an absolute mortality risk reduction of only 1.6% in our overall population.
- **Subgroup analyses**: Our analyses suggest a possible correlation between PE severity and treatment effect. The pooled ORs were similar in studies including (not exclusively) high-risk PE and studies restricted to intermediate-risk PE, with an estimated mortality risk reduction of approximately 55%, whereas the OR was suggestive of an absence of benefit in other groups.

### Low-dose aspirin for preventing recurrent venous thromboembolism [^112UEpPj]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2012). High credibility.

The study ASPIRE was published by Brighton TA and colleagues in 2012 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study focuses on the diseases of pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis. In the ASPIRE study, the trial question was: what is the role of low-dose aspirin in patients who have had a first episode of unprovoked VTE and have a high risk of recurrence after anticoagulants are discontinued?

The study was designed as a multi-center, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial (RCT) with a population of 822 patients, comprising 375 females and 447 males. The inclusion criteria were patients who had completed initial anticoagulant therapy following a first episode of unprovoked VTE. Key exclusion criteria included a first unprovoked episode of VTE more than two years before enrollment; an indication or contraindication for the use of aspirin, other antiplatelet therapy, or a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug; an indication for continuing oral anticoagulation therapy; or other medical problems that would interfere with participation in the trial or limit life expectancy.

- **Interventions**:
	- **Aspirin group**: n = 411 (100 mg PO once daily, for up to 4 years)
	- **Placebo group**: n = 411 (matching placebo PO once daily, for up to 4 years)

- **Primary outcome**: No significant difference in the incidence of recurrent VTE (4.8% per year vs. 6.5% per year; HR 0.74, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.05)

- **Secondary outcomes**: Significant decrease in the incidence of major vascular events (5.2% per year vs. 8% per year; HR 0.66, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.92)

### Thrombolytic therapy for pulmonary embolism [^115BpxEG]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Low credibility.

Thrombolytic therapy is usually reserved for individuals with clinically serious or massive pulmonary embolism (PE). Evidence suggests that thrombolytic agents may dissolve blood clots more rapidly than heparin and may reduce the death rate associated with PE. However, there are still concerns about the possible risk of adverse effects of thrombolytic therapy, such as major or minor hemorrhage. This is the fourth update of the Cochrane review first published in 2006.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of thrombolytic therapy for acute pulmonary embolism.

- **Search methods**: The Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialized Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL databases, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov trials registers to 17 August 2020. We undertook reference checking to identify additional studies.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared thrombolytic therapy followed by heparin versus heparin alone, heparin plus placebo, or surgical intervention for individuals with acute PE (massive/submassive). We did not include trials comparing two different thrombolytic agents or different doses of the same thrombolytic drug.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors (ZZ, QH) assessed the eligibility and risk of bias of trials and extracted data. We calculated effect estimates using the odds ratio (OR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) or the mean difference (MD) with a 95% CI. The primary outcomes of interest were…

### Acute pulmonary embolism: With an emphasis on an interventional approach [^115BB6ph]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2016). High credibility.

Compared with recent advances in the treatment of serious cardiovascular diseases, such as myocardial infarction and stroke, the treatment and outcome of acute pulmonary embolism (PE) have remained relatively unchanged over the last few decades. This has prompted several experts to call for the formation of multidisciplinary PE response teams with a more proactive approach to the treatment of PE. We discuss the formation of such teams and describe the available treatment options beyond anticoagulation, with a focus on the interventional approach. Acknowledging the paucity of data to support widespread adoption of such techniques, we advocate for the collection of outcomes data in multicenter registries and support randomized trials to evaluate interventional treatments in patients with high-risk PE.

### Aspirin for preventing the recurrence of venous thromboembolism [^115wvdUE]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2012). High credibility.

The WARFASA study, published by Becattini C and colleagues in 2012 in the journal N Engl J Med, examined the effect of aspirin in preventing recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE) in patients with pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis. This multicenter, double-blind, randomized controlled trial (RCT) involved 402 patients (145 females, 257 males) who experienced their first-ever unprovoked VTE and had completed 6 to 18 months of oral anticoagulant (OAC) treatment. Key exclusion criteria included cancer, major thrombophilia, an indication for long-term anticoagulant therapy for atrial fibrillation (AF) or prosthetic heart valve, active bleeding or high risk for bleeding, allergy or intolerance to aspirin, and a life expectancy of less than 6 months.

The interventions compared were aspirin (n = 205, 100 mg daily for 2 years) and a matching placebo (n = 197, daily for 2 years). The primary outcome was a significant decrease in the recurrence of VTE (6.6% vs. 11.2%; HR 0.58, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.93). Secondary outcomes included a significant decrease in recurrence due to pulmonary embolism (PE) (6.7% vs. 13.5%; HR 0.38, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.88) and no significant difference in recurrence due to deep vein thrombosis (DVT) (6.5% vs. 10.2%; HR 0.65, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.2) or in death (1.4% vs. 1.3%; HR 1.04, 95% CI 0.32 to 3.42). Safety outcomes indicated no significant difference in adverse events and major bleeding episodes.

The study concluded that in patients with a history of VTE, aspirin reduced the recurrence of thromboembolism without increasing the risk of major bleeding.
