## Question

Could you describe primary hyperaldosteronism, including its signs and symptoms, how it is diagnosed, and available treatments?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a description of primary hyperaldosteronism (PA) — its signs and symptoms, how it is diagnosed, and available treatments. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about when to screen for PA and why underdiagnosis matters. Then, I should verify how to perform and interpret the aldosterone–renin ratio (ARR), including pre-test conditions and medication effects. Next, I will examine when confirmatory testing is required versus when it can be reasonably omitted, and I should double-check the evidence base and evolving guidelines. After that, I must review subtype differentiation with CT and adrenal venous sampling (AVS), including exceptions. Finally, I will consider treatment selection for unilateral versus bilateral disease, monitoring and follow-up, and special populations such as familial hyperaldosteronism, while integrating emerging tools and acknowledging controversies.

> Let me first confirm the case-finding step, because if I miss who to screen, the whole pathway falters; PA accounts for roughly 5–10% of hypertension and up to 20% of resistant hypertension, yet fewer than 2% of at-risk individuals are ever tested, so I need to keep a low threshold for screening in resistant or severe hypertension, hypokalemia, adrenal incidentaloma, obstructive sleep apnea, atrial fibrillation with hypertension, young-onset hypertension, or a family history suggestive of PA or early stroke, as endorsed by Endocrine Society and primary care guidance, with ESC 2024 supporting broader consideration of renin and aldosterone testing in hypertensive adults [^115bXNhZ] [^112rERyA] [^112J2Qir] [^114yuZjF].

> Hold on, I should verify the screening test setup because false positives and negatives often stem from poor pre-analytics; the ARR is the universal first-line screen, obtained in the morning with the patient seated, with normal sodium intake for several days, and with hypokalemia corrected to avoid underestimating aldosterone, per ES 2025 and primary care recommendations [^115E2NtR] [^115bXNhZ] [^111KrBWa] [^1161K6m5].

> Wait, let me double-check medication interference before ordering the ARR; I need to minimize or hold drugs that distort the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis when it is safe to do so, such as mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, amiloride, triamterene, and beta-blockers that suppress renin, while preferentially using calcium-channel blockers and alpha-blockers to maintain blood pressure control if needed, recognizing that perfect washout is not always feasible in real-world care and may require pragmatic compromise to preserve safety [^115E2NtR] [^111KrBWa] [^116zB41q].

> I should confirm how to interpret a positive screen; the key is elevated plasma aldosterone with suppressed renin indicating renin-independent aldosterone production, with ES 2025 defining overt biochemical evidence as aldosterone ≥ 15 ng/dL by LC-MS/MS or ≥ 20 ng/dL by immunoassay with PRA ≤ 0.2 ng/mL/h or DRC ≤ 2 mU/L, noting that cutoffs vary by assay and units, so I must align with the local laboratory's standards to avoid misclassification [^1114bPr4] [^115bXNhZ].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about confirmatory testing; my initial reflex is to say "confirmatory suppression is mandatory for all positive ARR", which echoes older algorithms, but wait, I should verify the current stance — ES 2016 favored confirmatory testing broadly, whereas ES 2025 adopts a more individualized approach, allowing omission when there is overt biochemical PA, classic phenotypes such as resistant hypertension with spontaneous hypokalemia, or when results would not alter management, a shift that also reflects evidence questioning test accuracy and clinical utility in many scenarios [^113SqotY] [^1114bPr4] [^1114bPr4].

> Let me reconsider the evidence behind suppression tests because this influences whether I pursue them; meta-analyses reveal substantial spectrum and verification biases with saline, oral salt loading, fludrocortisone, and captopril tests, often overestimating diagnostic performance by 5–7 fold and missing cases, while contemporary critiques argue that PA exists along a biochemical continuum with assay uncertainty that undermines single thresholds, so I should reserve confirmatory testing for intermediate cases or when documentation is necessary for invasive steps or shared decision-making [^112TwPjG] [^113ZGbZ4] [^114NEkow] [^111rEEnw].

> If I do proceed with confirmation, I need to choose a test that fits the patient's risk and comorbidity profile; saline infusion with a post-infusion aldosterone > 280 pmol/L supports PA, oral sodium loading with 24-hour urinary aldosterone > 33 nmol/day is another option, and captopril challenge showing failure of aldosterone to suppress by > 30% is supportive, but I must avoid volume-loading tests in decompensated heart failure and be meticulous about pre-test medication and potassium status to reduce false results [^113rXtPJ] [^113H2d9h].

> Next, I should review subtype differentiation because treatment hinges on unilateral versus bilateral disease; CT of the adrenals is first-line to exclude carcinoma and to provide an anatomical roadmap, but I need to remember CT cannot reliably lateralize aldosterone excess, given the frequency of nonfunctioning nodules and microadenomas, so I must not rely on imaging alone to decide surgery in most adults [^1139rtce] [^117PRzPA] [^117CSSfg].

> I will now examine AVS, the functional gold standard, to determine lateralization; AVS should be obtained in surgical candidates and performed by experienced centers, often with ACTH stimulation, to compare aldosterone-to-cortisol ratios from each adrenal, and I should confirm the key exception that in patients under 35 years with a solitary adrenal lesion larger than 1 cm and marked PA, AVS may be omitted and surgery considered directly, though I need to ensure the phenotype truly fits this high-probability scenario before bypassing AVS [^115qC9tE] [^116wVH9t] [^113ttMkx] [^114aSGVd] [^116D7wh5].

> But wait, what if AVS is not available or the patient is not a surgical candidate; in that case I should pivot to optimized medical therapy while acknowledging that emerging tools such as machine-learning scores and molecular PET may refine lateralization in the future, yet these remain adjunctive or investigational at present and do not replace AVS in routine practice [^116HKxbH] [^112bqSjy] [^113WF2jj].

> Let me think about treatment selection now; for unilateral disease, laparoscopic adrenalectomy is the preferred, potentially curative approach that corrects hypokalemia and improves blood pressure with meaningful cardiovascular risk reduction, whereas bilateral disease or nonsurgical cases are managed with mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, typically spironolactone as first-line given cost and potency, with eplerenone as a more selective alternative when spironolactone is not tolerated [^115qC9tE] [^113SyDUH] [^117QyHo5] [^116YEMpU].

> I should confirm medical therapy goals and monitoring parameters; beyond achieving blood pressure and potassium control, I aim for biochemical control reflected by renin recovery as a marker of adequate mineralocorticoid receptor blockade, and I need to titrate while monitoring for hyperkalemia and renal function changes that can unmask underlying kidney disease once aldosterone-driven hyperfiltration abates [^112cPBZY] [^112UsMwt] [^114bEqKF].

> Hold on, I should verify postoperative expectations and surveillance after unilateral adrenalectomy; blood pressure improvement unfolds over weeks to months and some patients remain hypertensive due to concomitant essential hypertension or vascular remodeling, transient hypoaldosteronism with hyponatremia can occur, renal function often drops 15–30% from reversal of hyperfiltration, and reassessing ARR at 3–6 months helps document biochemical cure and guide long-term care [^114bEqKF] [^117CSSfg] [^113GdZw9].

> Next, I should review longitudinal follow-up regardless of modality; for medical therapy, I will check electrolytes and kidney function every 3–6 months, adjust MRAs to maintain normokalemia and blood pressure targets, and counsel on adherence and side effects, and for both surgical and medical pathways I should consider rescreening if hypertension worsens unexpectedly or if new hypokalemia or atrial fibrillation emerges over time [^115qC9tE] [^112oB6TV].

> I need to ensure I address special populations, especially suspected familial hyperaldosteronism; I should consider genetic testing in early-onset hypertension, strong family history, or stroke under age 40, screen first-degree relatives when FH is confirmed, and tailor management to normalize blood pressure, ARR, and potassium while coordinating AVS decisions and imaging with a multidisciplinary team for young patients [^111hqJtU] [^115hmR4Y] [^114cyscL] [^111o5fYv] [^115vCU2G].

> Finally, let me reconsider the overarching pathway to avoid common pitfalls; PA is a multidimensional spectrum that remains vastly underdiagnosed, so I should lower the threshold to screen, optimize ARR pre-analytics, use confirmatory testing selectively where it changes management, rely on AVS for surgical decision-making except in well-defined young high-probability cases, and individualize therapy and follow-up while keeping an eye on emerging noninvasive lateralization tools and pragmatic, outcome-focused approaches that aim to close the care gap [^112cPBZY] [^114NEkow] [^117PRzPA] [^112bqSjy].

Primary hyperaldosteronism (PA) is characterized by **autonomous aldosterone excess** causing **hypertension and hypokalemia** [^112cPBZY]. Diagnosis starts with an **elevated aldosterone-to-renin ratio (ARR)** [^115bXNhZ] [^111KrBWa]; suppression testing confirms the diagnosis unless classic features are present [^1114bPr4]. Subtype is determined by adrenal CT [^1139rtce] and **adrenal vein sampling (AVS)** [^117PRzPA] [^113GdZw9]. Unilateral disease is treated with **adrenalectomy** [^115qC9tE], whereas bilateral disease or nonsurgical cases receive **mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs)** such as spironolactone [^117QyHo5] or eplerenone [^113SyDUH] [^115qC9tE]. Early, targeted therapy reduces **cardiovascular and renal complications** [^116YEMpU] [^112UsMwt].

---

## Pathophysiology

PA involves **renin-independent aldosterone** secretion [^1159NonN], most often due to an aldosterone-producing adenoma (APA) or bilateral adrenal hyperplasia (BAH), with rare familial or malignant causes [^112FjKWU] [^115hmR4Y]. Excess aldosterone drives sodium retention, potassium wasting, and volume expansion, leading to hypertension, hypokalemia, and metabolic alkalosis [^1159NonN].

---

## Clinical signs and symptoms

PA typically presents with:

- **Hypertension**: Often resistant or severe; sometimes mild or normotensive [^112cPBZY] [^112UsMwt].
- **Hypokalemia**: Spontaneous or diuretic-induced; may be absent in up to 50% [^112FjKWU].
- **Metabolic alkalosis**: From hydrogen ion loss [^1159NonN].
- **Polyuria and polydipsia**: Due to renal potassium loss [^112FjKWU].
- **Muscle weakness and cramps**: From hypokalemia [^112FjKWU].
- **Fatigue and headache**: Nonspecific but common [^112UsMwt].
- **Cardiovascular complications**: Increased risk of stroke, MI, AF, and CKD [^117CSSfg] [^112cPBZY].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

---

### Screening

- **Indications**: Resistant hypertension, hypertension with hypokalemia, adrenal incidentaloma, early-onset hypertension, or family history of PA [^111KrBWa] [^112J2Qir] [^112rERyA] [^114yuZjF].
- **Initial test**: ARR with simultaneous aldosterone and renin; elevated ARR with suppressed renin suggests PA [^115bXNhZ] [^1161K6m5].
- **Technical considerations**: Measure in the morning, seated [^115E2NtR], without sodium restriction; correct hypokalemia before testing [^113rDc6q].

---

### Confirmatory testing

Confirmatory testing is indicated when the ARR is positive but classic features are absent — spontaneous hypokalemia, suppressed renin, and **aldosterone > 20 ng/dL** [^113SqotY] [^111Q2cpP]. Options include saline infusion, oral salt loading, fludrocortisone suppression, or captopril challenge [^113SqotY] [^113ZGbZ4]. Testing may be omitted in patients with a classic phenotype or high-probability biochemistry [^1116h4U6] [^1114bPr4].

---

### Subtype differentiation

- **Imaging**: Adrenal CT to detect adenomas or hyperplasia [^1139rtce] [^114jKiho].
- **Adrenal vein sampling (AVS)**: Gold standard to distinguish unilateral from bilateral disease [^1131UbGV] [^114jKiho].
- **When to omit AVS**: Age < 35 with classic phenotype and unilateral adenoma > 1 cm on CT [^116D7wh5].

---

## Treatment strategies

Treatment aims to **normalize blood pressure, potassium, and aldosterone** and reduce cardiovascular risk [^115qC9tE].

---

### Surgical management

Surgical management is reserved for unilateral disease (typically an APA) confirmed by AVS [^1131UbGV]. The preferred procedure is **laparoscopic adrenalectomy**, which is often curative, with expected outcomes of potassium normalization and improved blood pressure control [^113GdZw9] [^116YEMpU].

---

### Medical management

Medical management is indicated for bilateral disease (BAH) or for patients who are not surgical candidates [^115qC9tE] [^113SyDUH]. Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists such as **spironolactone** or **eplerenone** are used to control blood pressure and correct hypokalemia [^117QyHo5] [^113SyDUH], with ongoing monitoring of potassium, renal function, and blood pressure required [^113SyDUH].

---

## Prognosis and complications

Untreated PA increases cardiovascular and renal morbidity and mortality [^112cPBZY]. Timely, targeted therapy **improves outcomes** [^112FjKWU] [^116YEMpU].

---

Primary hyperaldosteronism is a common, treatable cause of secondary hypertension [^113MZ2J8] [^1138LUrk]. Early diagnosis and targeted therapy — surgical for unilateral disease and MRAs for bilateral or nonsurgical cases — are essential to reduce **cardiovascular and renal complications** [^113GdZw9] [^115qC9tE].

### Diagnosis and treatment of primary aldosteronism [^113GdZw9]. The Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology (2021). Low credibility.

Primary aldosteronism is a common cause of secondary hypertension associated with excess cardiovascular morbidities. It is underdiagnosed because it does not have a specific, easily identifiable feature, and clinicians can be poorly aware of the disease. The diagnostic investigation is a multistep process of screening, confirmatory testing, and subtype differentiation of unilateral from bilateral forms for therapeutic management. Adrenal venous sampling is key for reliable subtype identification but can be bypassed in patients with specific characteristics.

For unilateral disease, surgery offers the possibility of a cure, with total laparoscopic unilateral adrenalectomy being the treatment of choice. Bilateral forms are treated mainly with mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists. The goals of treatment are to normalize both blood pressure and excessive aldosterone production, and the primary aims are to reduce associated comorbidities, improve quality of life, and reduce mortality.

Prompt diagnosis of primary aldosteronism and the use of targeted treatment strategies mitigate aldosterone-specific target organ damage, and with appropriate patient management, outcomes can be excellent. Advances in molecular histopathology challenge the traditional concept of primary aldosteronism as a binary disease, caused by either a unilateral aldosterone-producing adenoma or bilateral adrenal hyperplasia. Somatic mutations drive autonomous aldosterone production in most adenomas. Many of these same mutations have been identified in nodular lesions adjacent to an aldosterone-producing adenoma.

### Primary aldosteronism: Where are we now? Where to from here [^113MZ2J8]. Hypertension (2022). High credibility.

Primary aldosteronism, the most common secondary form of hypertension, is thought to be present in approximately 5% to 10% of hypertensive adults. However, recent studies indicate that its prevalence may be at least threefold higher based on the identification of renin-independent (autonomous) aldosterone production that is not suppressible with dietary sodium loading in a large fraction of adults with primary hypertension. Currently, the screening rate for primary aldosteronism in adults with primary hypertension is less than 1%.

This review addresses primary aldosteronism through the lens of three key questions: Where are we now? Where to from here? How do we get there?

### Primary aldosteronism: Current knowledge and controversies in Conn's syndrome [^116t5ER9]. Nature Clinical Practice: Endocrinology & Metabolism (2007). Low credibility.

Primary aldosteronism has been recognized as a common cause of secondary hypertension, accounting for approximately 10% of the hypertensive population. Screening should be applied in hypertensive patients presenting with one of the following: hypokalemia, refractory hypertension, suggestive family history, or an incidentally detected adrenal mass. The currently most advocated screening test is the aldosterone-to-renin ratio, which has high sensitivity but low specificity. The specificity increases if patients with low aldosterone concentrations are excluded. Published cut-off values vary depending on the hormone assay and the investigated population.

Before screening, antihypertensive treatment, especially aldosterone antagonists and beta-blockers, should be discontinued. A pathologic result requires additional work-up to prove mineralocorticoid excess. Subtype differentiation is performed by adrenal venous sampling combined with imaging (CT or MRI). One-third of cases are due to aldosterone-producing adenomas, for which the preferred treatment is laparoscopic adrenalectomy. Bilateral adrenal hyperplasia (idiopathic aldosteronism) underlies two-thirds of cases and requires treatment with aldosterone antagonists. Treatment is started with low doses of spironolactone (25–50 mg once daily), which often results in substantial improvements in hypertension.

Regarding diagnostic procedures for primary aldosteronism, specifically in relation to adrenal venous sampling, the HC 2020 guidelines recommend considering selective adrenal venous sampling. This is to verify that an abnormally appearing adrenal gland is the source of hypersecretion, particularly if surgery to remove a suspected unilateral source of PA is planned, as adrenal lesions or adenomas found on imaging may be nonfunctional.

---

### Diagnosis and management of primary aldosteronism [^113H2d9h]. World Journal of Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

Identifying primary aldosteronism within the hypertensive population is an important clinical challenge, as most patients with a unilateral source of excess aldosterone secretion are amenable to surgical cure. At least 20% of patients with primary aldosteronism have normal serum potassium levels; therefore, screening tests should not be based on recognition of hypokalemia alone. Rather, the diagnosis should depend on identifying renin suppression and measuring the ratio of plasma aldosterone concentration to plasma renin activity. The diagnosis may be confirmed by performing an aldosterone suppression test after oral salt loading.

Once primary aldosteronism has been established, it is necessary to exclude glucocorticoid-remediable aldosteronism and then proceed to localization studies. Detecting a unilateral source of aldosterone, usually due to an adenoma (Conn syndrome), is achieved by postural hormonal testing and confirmed by selective venous sampling (SVS) with measurement of aldosterone concentrations (expressed as the aldosterone/cortisol ratio) in each adrenal vein. SVS is enjoying a revival in many institutions as it is more sensitive and specific than either cross-sectional imaging or scintigraphy and has the potential to influence significantly both the diagnosis and clinical decision-making.

Patients with unilateral disease are ideally treated by laparoscopic adrenalectomy. Patients in whom localization is not achieved usually have bilateral adrenal hyperplasia and are treated medically.

### Is it time to retire confirmatory testing for primary aldosteronism [^111rEEnw]. American Journal of Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Primary aldosteronism (PA) is the most common endocrine hypertension. For decades, PA diagnosis has required proving non-suppressibility of aldosterone following maneuvers modulating the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone pathway. This includes oral salt suppression, intravenous saline suppression, captopril suppression, and others. Grounded in rational first principles from pathophysiologic considerations and small, early pathophysiologic studies following Conn's initial PA description, such testing has been widely recommended.

However, a modern understanding of PA pathophysiology and critical appraisal of diagnostic test studies suggest that traditional suppression testing is not suited to diagnosis or disease definition. There are four main problems recently raised regarding aldosterone suppression testing:

- **Continuous biochemical spectrum**: PA is now known to exist along a continuous biochemical spectrum, and it is scientifically impossible to draw a single diagnostic threshold within this continuum.

- **Aldosterone assay uncertainty**: Aldosterone assay uncertainty is sufficiently large to yield contradictory final diagnoses when applied to a threshold during suppression testing.

- **Multi-factorial pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of PA is multi-factorial, with multiple mechanisms not necessarily relevant to salt and volume loading tests.

- **Meta-analysis findings**: Finally, a meta-analysis of suppression testing studies demonstrated extensive biases and confounders, which have over-estimated the diagnostic value.

A recent prospective, blinded study of saline suppression for PA diagnosis, defined by medical or surgical response to PA-targeted therapy, showed no discrimination according to nadir aldosteronism levels.

### Development of a prediction score to avoid confirmatory testing in patients with suspected primary aldosteronism [^116HKxbH]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Low credibility.

The diagnostic work-up of primary aldosteronism (PA) includes screening and confirmation steps. Case confirmation is time-consuming, expensive, and there is no consensus on tests and thresholds to be used. Diagnostic algorithms to avoid confirmatory testing may be useful for managing patients with PA.

The objective was the development and validation of diagnostic models to confirm or exclude PA diagnosis in patients with a positive screening test.

- **Design, patients, and setting**: We evaluated 1024 patients who underwent confirmatory testing for PA. The diagnostic models were developed in a training cohort (n = 522) and then tested on an internal validation cohort (n = 174) and an independent external prospective cohort (n = 328).

- **Main outcome measure**: Different diagnostic models and a 16-point score were developed using machine learning and regression analysis to discriminate patients with a confirmed diagnosis of PA.

- **Results**: Male sex, antihypertensive medication, plasma renin activity, aldosterone, potassium levels, and the presence of organ damage were associated with a confirmed diagnosis of PA. Machine learning-based models displayed an accuracy of 72.9% to 83.9%. The Primary Aldosteronism Confirmatory Testing (PACT) score correctly classified 84.1% at training and 83.9% or 81.1% at internal and external validation, respectively. A flow chart employing the PACT score to select patients for confirmatory testing correctly managed all patients and resulted in a 22.8% reduction in the number of confirmatory tests.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for primary aldosteronism, specifically concerning confirmatory testing, the ES 2025 guidelines recommend considering aldosterone suppression testing in patients who screen positive for PA. This is especially pertinent when screening results indicate an intermediate probability for lateralizing PA, and individualized decision-making confirms a desire to pursue eligibility for surgical therapy.

### Primary aldosteronism: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^116D7wh5]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic procedures for primary aldosteronism, specifically relating to adrenal venous sampling, the ES 2025 guidelines recommend considering the omission of adrenal venous sampling when a diagnosis of unilateral aldosterone-producing adenoma is highly probable. This is especially applicable in patients aged under 35 years with marked primary aldosteronism and a solitary adrenal lesion larger than 1.0 cm on CT.

### Primary aldosteronism [^112cafBu]. American Family Physician (2023). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic procedures for primary aldosteronism, more specifically with respect to adrenal venous sampling, AAFP 2023 guidelines recommend obtaining an adrenal CT and adrenal venous sampling to determine if aldosterone production is unilateral or bilateral once PA has been diagnosed.

### Treating primary aldosteronism-induced hypertension: Novel approaches and future outlooks [^117PJN7o]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). Low credibility.

Challenges in screening

Primary aldosteronism (PA) is underdiagnosed and undertreated in clinical practice, where screening and diagnosis are the principal challenges that limit effective management. The traditional diagnosis and treatment workflow for PA is highlighted in Figures 1 and 2. Overall, there is no consensus on recommended screening for PA in hypertensive individuals within either primary or secondary care settings.

The Endocrine Society guidelines for the diagnosis and management of PA recommend screening up to 50% of "at risk" patients. Screening under these recommendations should be carried out using the aldosterone–renin ratio (ARR) with particular attention paid to those with:

- Severe hypertension
- Hypertension with spontaneous or diuretic-induced hypokalemia
- An adrenal mass
- Sleep apnea
- A family history of early-onset hypertension
- Stroke at a young age
- A first-degree relative who has PA

The American Heart Association guidelines for the diagnosis and management of hypertension align with the Endocrine Society guidelines regarding recognized risk factors which should trigger screening for PA. In contrast, the European Society of Cardiology/European Society of Hypertension guidance does not emphasize the need to screen for PA except in patients with treatment-resistant hypertension, which accounts for approximately 5% of all patients. Some national guidelines for the management of hypertension, such as those of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence in the UK, do not specifically reference screening for PA.

### Personalized treatment of patients with primary aldosteronism [^116YEMpU]. Endocrine Practice (2023). High credibility.

Primary aldosteronism (PA) is a highly prevalent yet underdiagnosed secondary cause of hypertension. PA is associated with increased cardiovascular and renal morbidity compared with patients with primary hypertension. Thus, prompt identification and targeted therapy of PA are essential to reduce cardiovascular and renal morbidity and mortality in a large population with hypertension. Unilateral adrenalectomy is preferred for lateralized PA as the only potentially curative therapy. Surgery also mitigates the risk of cardiovascular and renal complications associated with PA. Targeted medical therapy, commonly including a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, is offered to patients with bilateral PA and those who are not surgical candidates. Novel therapies, including nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists and aldosterone synthase inhibitors, are being developed as alternative options for PA treatment. In this review article, we discuss how to best individualize therapy for patients with PA.

The diagnostic investigations for primary aldosteronism, particularly concerning the plasma aldosterone-to-renin ratio, involve specific steps. The ES 2025 guidelines recommend correcting potassium levels within the laboratory reference range if screening results are negative and the patient exhibits hypokalemia, followed by a repeat screening.

### Primary aldosteronism - a multidimensional syndrome [^112cPBZY]. Nature Reviews Endocrinology (2022). High credibility.

Primary aldosteronism is a common cause of hypertension and a risk factor for cardiovascular and renal morbidity and mortality, via mechanisms mediated by both hypertension and direct insults to target organs. Despite its high prevalence and associated complications, primary aldosteronism remains largely under-recognized, with less than 2% of people in at-risk populations ever tested. Fundamental progress made over the past decade has transformed our understanding of the pathogenesis and clinical phenotypes of primary aldosteronism. The dichotomous paradigm of primary aldosteronism diagnosis and subtyping is being redefined into a multidimensional spectrum of disease. This spectrum spans subclinical stages to florid primary aldosteronism and includes single-focal or multifocal to diffuse aldosterone-producing areas, which can affect one or both adrenal glands. This review discusses how redefining the primary aldosteronism syndrome as a multidimensional spectrum will affect the approach to the diagnosis and subtyping of primary aldosteronism.

### Primary aldosteronism: An update on screening, diagnosis and treatment [^115MNPst]. Journal of Hypertension (2008). Low credibility.

Primary aldosteronism is much more common than previously thought; it implies excessive organ damage to the heart, vessels, and kidney, which translates into an excess of cardiovascular events. These features, along with the fact that arterial hypertension and hypokalemia can be corrected with a timely diagnosis and appropriate therapy, warrant an aggressive diagnostic approach in hypertensive patients.

- **Objectives**: To provide updated information on the screening and exclusion tests for primary aldosteronism and to illustrate the strategy for primary aldosteronism subtype differentiation.

- **Design**: Review of the literature and personal experience of the authors.

- **Results**: The available evidence shows that a cost-effective strategy for screening patients with primary aldosteronism can be utilized at most centers. In contrast, the identification of primary aldosteronism subtypes, such as differentiating patients with an aldosterone-producing adenoma from those with idiopathic hyperaldosteronism, should be undertaken at tertiary referral centers.

- **Conclusion**: Identifying a curable form of primary aldosteronism can be highly rewarding for both the patient and the doctor. Therefore, an aggressive diagnostic approach is mandatory in certain subgroups of hypertensive patients who are at higher prior risk of primary aldosteronism or can benefit more from an accurate diagnosis.

The following constitutes key background information on primary aldosteronism:

- **Definition**: Primary hyperaldosteronism is an endocrine disorder characterized by excessive secretion of aldosterone from the adrenal glands.

- **Pathophysiology**: Hypersecretion of aldosterone may be due to neoplasia of the adrenal glands, such as adrenal adenoma or adrenocortical carcinoma, adrenal hyperplasia (typically bilateral), mutations in genes coding for enzymes involved in aldosterone synthesis (familial hyperaldosteronism), or it may be idiopathic. Ectopic aldosterone-producing adenoma or carcinoma accounts for less than 0.1% of cases.

- **Epidemiology**: In patients with secondary hypertension, the prevalence of primary hyperaldosteronism is estimated at 5–20%.

- **Disease course**: Increased plasma aldosterone leads to the clinical manifestations of resistant hypertension and hypokalemia. Untreated disease may result in early cardiovascular complications and chronic kidney disease (CKD).

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Patients with primary aldosteronism have an increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity, including myocardial infarction, stroke, and atrial fibrillation, compared with matched controls with essential hypertension. The 10-year survival of patients with hyperaldosteronism is similar to that of matched hypertensive controls.

### Update in primary aldosteronism [^1129uYT4]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2009). Low credibility.

It is now widely recognized that primary aldosteronism (PA) is much more common than previously thought, accounting for up to 5–10% of hypertensive cases, and that aldosterone excess has adverse cardiovascular consequences beyond the development of hypertension. These findings have led to a marked resurgence of research activity, most of which supports the concept that PA plays an important role in cardiovascular disease and should be systematically identified and specifically treated. This has contributed to the development of an Endocrine Society clinical guideline for the case detection, diagnosis, and management of this common, specifically treatable, and potentially curable condition.

- **Excess morbidity in PA**: Recent research has demonstrated that patients with PA exhibit higher morbidity compared to other forms of hypertension, confirming the clinical relevance of non-blood pressure-dependent adverse effects of aldosterone excess.
- **Importance of specific therapy**: Further studies show that excess morbidity and mortality in PA patients are ameliorated with specific (but not nonspecific antihypertensive) therapy directed against aldosterone excess. This underscores the importance of detecting and diagnosing PA for optimal management.
- **New treatment strategies**: The development of new treatment strategies is underway.
- **Diagnostic approaches**: There is ongoing appraisal and refinement of diagnostic approaches, including screening, subtype differentiation, and new assay development.
- **Genetic insights**: Research continues to provide further insights into the importance and nature of genetic factors related to the development of PA.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for primary aldosteronism, specifically with respect to the plasma aldosterone-to-renin ratio, the Endocrine Society 2025 guidelines recommend obtaining serum/plasma aldosterone concentration and plasma renin (concentration or activity). The determination of the aldosterone-to-renin ratio is advised to screen for primary aldosteronism in patients with hypertension.

### Primary aldosteronism: JACC state-of-the-art review [^117CSSfg]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). Low credibility.

Primary aldosteronism (PA) is a common, but frequently overlooked, cause of arterial hypertension and excess cardiovascular events, particularly atrial fibrillation. Timely diagnosis and treatment can provide a cure for hyperaldosteronism and hypertension, even when the latter is resistant to drug treatment. Strategies to screen patients for PA early with a simplified diagnostic algorithm are justified and can be particularly beneficial in some subgroups of hypertensive patients, especially those at the highest cardiovascular risk.

However, identification of surgically curable cases of PA and achievement of optimal results require subtyping with adrenal vein sampling. This procedure is technically challenging and currently performed only in tertiary referral centers, representing a bottleneck in the work-up of PA.

- **Measures aimed at improving the clinical use of adrenal vein sampling**: Development of alternative techniques for subtyping and recommendations for drug treatment, including new developments in the field, are discussed. Follow-up recommendations are also covered.

Regarding the medical management of primary aldosteronism, specifically concerning general principles, the ES 2025 guidelines recommend considering PA-specific therapy, either medical or surgical, for patients with hypertension and PA:

- **Consider preferring medical treatment** with mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists over nonspecific antihypertensive therapy in patients with lateralizing PA who are not surgical candidates or do not desire surgery, and in patients with bilateral PA.

- **Consider preferring unilateral adrenalectomy** over nonspecific antihypertensive therapy in patients with lateralizing PA who are surgical candidates and desire surgery.

### Primary aldosteronism: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^1114bPr4]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for primary aldosteronism, especially concerning confirmatory testing, the ES 2025 guidelines advise that aldosterone suppression testing is not required before initiating PA-specific therapy in the following cases:

- **Patients with resistant hypertension or hypertension with hypokalemia**: Do not obtain aldosterone suppression testing if there is overt biochemical evidence of renin-independent aldosterone production, defined as plasma renin activity ≤ 0.2 ng/mL/h or direct renin concentration ≤ 2 mU/L, and plasma aldosterone concentration ≥ 15 ng/dL (≥ 416 pmol/L) via liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry assay or ≥ 20 ng/dL (≥ 554 pmol/L) via immunoassay, due to the risk of false-negative results, which may exceed the risk of false-positive screening results.

- **Patients unable or unwilling to pursue adrenal venous sampling and adrenalectomy**: Consider empirically treating these patients with mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists based on screening results, without aldosterone suppression testing. Recognize that aldosterone suppression testing may still provide value in some cases for further documenting the diagnosis.

- **Families with germline mutations associated with familial hyperaldosteronism**: Avoid obtaining aldosterone suppression testing; conduct genetic screening for all first-degree relatives of patients with familial hyperaldosteronism and for patients with young-onset PA (< 20 years) to enable early diagnosis and treatment.

- **Patients with a low likelihood of lateralizing PA**: Avoid obtaining aldosterone suppression testing.

### Primary aldosteronism: Molecular medicine meets public health [^115hmR4Y]. Nature Reviews Nephrology (2023). High credibility.

Germline mutations

Primary aldosteronism (PA) can be categorized based on its heritability. The vast majority of PA cases are sporadic. However, in rare instances, the condition affects multiple family members and is termed familial hyperaldosteronism (FH). Various forms of FH exist, distinguished by their clinical features and reported genetic causes. The characteristic early onset and heritability of FH makes it an attractive target for understanding more common sporadic PA. Conversely, large-scale next-generation sequencing studies of sporadic cases have greatly informed the FH field. All Mendelian causes of PA are rare, and specialists in different regions often find that members of a handful of families are referred to them. Although familial cases represent a tiny proportion of PA, investigations of these patients have demonstrated that PA can be caused by mutations that induce constitutive aldosterone production.

### Evolution of the primary aldosteronism syndrome: Updating the approach [^116F42LE]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Low credibility.

New approaches are needed to address the evolution of the primary aldosteronism syndrome and to increase its recognition. Herein, we review evidence indicating that primary aldosteronism is a prevalent syndrome that is mostly unrecognized, and present a pragmatic and pathophysiology-based approach to improve diagnosis and treatment.

- **Methods**: Evidence was gathered from published guidelines and studies identified from PubMed by searching for primary aldosteronism, aldosterone, renin, and hypertension. This evidence was supplemented by the authors' personal knowledge, research experience, and clinical encounters in primary aldosteronism.

- **Interpretation of evidence**: Renin-independent aldosterone production is a prevalent phenotype that is diagnosed as primary aldosteronism when severe in magnitude, but is largely unrecognized when milder in severity. Renin-independent aldosterone production can be detected in normotensive and hypertensive individuals, and the magnitude of this biochemical phenotype parallels the magnitude of blood pressure elevation, the risk for incident hypertension and cardiovascular disease, and the likelihood and magnitude of blood pressure reduction with mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist therapy. Expansion of the indications to screen for primary aldosteronism, combined with the use of a pathophysiology-based approach that emphasizes inappropriate aldosterone production in the context of renin suppression, will substantially increase the diagnostic and therapeutic yields for primary aldosteronism.

- **Conclusions**: The landscape of primary aldosteronism requires further exploration and adaptation, emphasizing the need for updated diagnostic strategies and treatments to better manage this underrecognized syndrome.

### Performance of confirmatory tests for diagnosing primary aldosteronism: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^112TwPjG]. Hypertension (2022). Low credibility.

In addition to differences in testing protocols and thresholds, other major drivers of heterogeneity were related to study quality (Figure 3). Studies with case-control sampling overestimated test accuracy by 7-fold compared with those enrolling consecutive or randomly selected patients in whom there was diagnostic uncertainty (relative diagnostic odds ratio, 7.26 [95% CI, 2.46–21.43]). Similarly, the use of 2- or multi-gate designs (e.g. inclusion of patients never suspected to have PA) was associated with a 4-fold overestimation of the diagnostic odds ratio (3.92 [95% CI, 1.27–12.05]), while partial verification or use of inconsistent reference standards resulted in a 5-fold overestimation (5.12 [95% CI, 1.48–17.77]). Post hoc interpretation of test results with knowledge of disease status potentially overestimated accuracy by 3-fold (3.32 [95% CI, 0.94–11.79]).

Apart from disease prevalence, none of the clinical characteristics examined were associated with changes in test accuracy. For each test, the direction and magnitude of effects were consistent with the overall estimates, though meta-regression was sometimes underpowered owing to the small number of studies in some cases.

- **Publication bias**: Deeks' funnel plot appeared asymmetrical for the recumbent SIT, FST, and CCT, suggesting publication bias, but statistical tests were nonsignificant.

- **Clinical implications**: Each test was applied to a hypothetical cohort of 1000 patients to help contextualize the performance under different conditions. With a fixed specificity of 95%, the number…

Concerning follow-up and surveillance for primary aldosteronism, the HC 2020 guidelines recommend acknowledging that PA is associated with a relative hyperfiltration injury to the kidney that exceeds what is seen in essential hypertension. Treatment of PA, whether through surgery or medical therapy, may reveal significant underlying renal disease with an increase in creatinine and a decrease in eGFR. Close monitoring of renal function after treatment is essential.

### Significance of discordant results between confirmatory tests in diagnosis of primary aldosteronism [^111vUnKD]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Low credibility.

Clinical guidelines recommend confirmation of a positive result in at least one confirmatory test in the diagnosis of primary aldosteronism (PA). The clinical implication of multiple confirmatory tests has not been established, especially when patients show discordant results.

The aim of the present study was to explore the role of two confirmatory tests in subtype diagnosis of PA. A retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted at two referral centers.

We identified 360 hypertensive patients who underwent both a captopril challenge test (CCT) and a saline infusion test (SIT), exhibiting at least one positive result. Among them, we studied 193 patients with PA whose data were available for subtype diagnosis based on adrenal vein sampling (AVS).

The prevalence of the bilateral subtype on AVS according to the results of the confirmatory tests was measured. Of the patients studied, 127 were positive for both CCT and SIT (double-positive), whereas 66 were positive for either CCT or SIT (single-positive) (n = 34 and n = 32, respectively). Altogether, 135 were diagnosed with the bilateral subtype on AVS. The single-positive patients had milder clinical features of PA than the double-positive patients. The prevalence of the bilateral subtype on AVS was significantly higher in the single-positive patients than in the double-positive patients (63/66 [95.5%] vs 72/127 [56.7%], p < 0.01). Several clinical parameters were different between CCT single-positive and SIT single-positive patients.

### Pathogenesis and treatment of primary aldosteronism [^1159NonN]. Nature Reviews Endocrinology (2020). High credibility.

Early diagnosis and appropriate treatment of primary aldosteronism, the most frequent cause of secondary hypertension, are crucial to prevent deleterious cardiovascular outcomes. In the past decade, the discovery of genetic abnormalities responsible for sporadic and familial forms of primary aldosteronism has improved the understanding of the pathogenesis of this disorder. Mutations in genes encoding ion channels and pumps lead to increased cytosolic concentrations of calcium in zona glomerulosa cells, which triggers CYP11B2 expression and autonomous aldosterone production. Improved understanding of the mechanisms underlying the disease is key to enhancing diagnostics and to developing and implementing targeted treatments.

This review provides an update on the genetic abnormalities associated with sporadic and familial forms of primary aldosteronism, their frequency among different populations, and the mechanisms explaining excessive aldosterone production and adrenal nodule development. The possible effects and uses of these findings for improving diagnostics for primary aldosteronism are discussed. Furthermore, treatment options for primary aldosteronism are reviewed, with particular attention to the latest studies on blood pressure and cardiovascular outcomes following medical or surgical treatment. The new perspectives regarding the use of targeted drug therapy for aldosterone-producing adenomas with specific somatic mutations are also addressed.

### Progress in the management of primary aldosteronism [^116Tsxhw]. American Journal of Hypertension (2018). Low credibility.

After decades in which primary aldosteronism (PA) was nearly neglected as a rare cause of secondary hypertension, it is now garnering increasing interest from both basic and clinical standpoints. Clinically, in managing hypertension, both general practitioners and specialists should share the common understanding that diagnosing and appropriately treating PA, especially in surgically curable subtypes, can be very rewarding.

Two aspects of the disease must be considered: one that depends on blood pressure and another induced by aldosterone (and salt), independent of blood pressure. Specifically, the following areas in PA clinical research are anticipated:

- **Population-based screening**: Appropriately designed studies for screening PA.
- **Ethnicity-based differences**: Research on differences in diagnosis across various ethnic groups.
- **Prospective studies**: Investigations focusing on clinical outcomes such as blood pressure, target organ morbidities and mortalities, quality of life, among others.

Finally, a more detailed understanding of the pathophysiology and advanced care and cure for patients could substantially contribute to lowering cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in individuals with hypertension, ultimately improving public health.

### Primary aldosteronism: Molecular medicine meets public health [^115ahsre]. Nature Reviews Nephrology (2023). High credibility.

In this review, we focus on molecular discoveries and developments that have the potential to transform the clinical management of patients with primary aldosteronism (PA). We describe emerging innovations in diagnosis and therapy that may, in the future, be tailored to permit optimal management of each patient. We appreciate that many of the innovations and discoveries have been made in patients undergoing investigation or treatment for unilateral PA, who are a fraction of the total and are furthest in line from primary care, where the main bottleneck of diagnosing PA resides.

However, interest in them is justified partly because they are the patients in whom links between molecular pathogenesis and outcomes are most readily studied, and partly because the arduous course of diagnosing and managing their disease discourages physicians from seeking such patients. We culminate in a hypothesis that draws on public health and molecular medicine to bridge the physiological and pathological links between sodium and aldosterone by suggesting that PA arises, at least in part, as a maladaptive response to the chronic over-ingestion of salt.

### Performance of confirmatory tests for diagnosing primary aldosteronism: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114NEkow]. Hypertension (2022). Low credibility.

Recommendations for confirmatory testing in patients who have high-probability features of primary aldosteronism (PA) are based on very low-quality evidence. The implication of our findings is that improvements in care may be realized by forgoing routine confirmatory tests if these add little to the diagnostic work-up, but present an unnecessary barrier in an already lengthy and complex diagnostic-care pathway. A potential future pathway may be to rely on the aldosterone-renin ratio (ARR) together with clinical and biochemical characteristics to diagnose most cases of PA. An early introduction of empirical mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist treatment in the majority of patients could be beneficial, while reserving adrenal vein sampling for those who are most likely to benefit from potential surgery. Given that only a small fraction of patients with PA are ever diagnosed and treated, a paradigm shift is needed to meaningfully close care gaps and to improve clinical outcomes.

### Primary aldosteronism: Molecular medicine meets public health [^1138LUrk]. Nature Reviews Nephrology (2023). High credibility.

Primary aldosteronism is the most common single cause of hypertension and is potentially curable when only one adrenal gland is the culprit. The importance of primary aldosteronism to public health derives from its high prevalence but huge under-diagnosis (estimated to be less than 1% of all affected individuals), despite the consequences of poor blood pressure control by conventional therapy and enhanced cardiovascular risk. This state of affairs is attributable to the fact that the tools used for diagnosis or treatment are still those that originated in the 1970s–1990s.

Conversely, molecular discoveries have transformed our understanding of adrenal physiology and pathology. Many molecules and processes associated with constant adrenocortical renewal and interzonal metamorphosis also feature in aldosterone-producing adenomas and aldosterone-producing micronodules. The adrenal gland has one of the most significant rates of non-silent somatic mutations, with frequent selection of those driving autonomous aldosterone production, and distinct clinical presentations and outcomes for most genotypes. The disappearance of aldosterone synthesis and cells from most of the adult human zona glomerulosa is the likely driver of the mutational success that causes aldosterone-producing adenomas. Insights into the pathways that lead to constitutive aldosterone production and cell survival may open up opportunities for novel therapies.

### Performance of confirmatory tests for diagnosing primary aldosteronism: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^113ZGbZ4]. Hypertension (2022). Low credibility.

Confirmatory tests are recommended for diagnosing primary aldosteronism, but the supporting evidence is unclear.

- **Methods**: We searched Medline, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Studies evaluating any guideline-recommended confirmatory test — such as the saline infusion test, salt loading test, fludrocortisone suppression test, and captopril challenge test — compared with a reference standard were included. The Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 tool was used to assess the risk of bias. Meta-analyses were conducted using hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic models.

- **Results**: Fifty-five studies were included, comprising 26 studies (3,654 participants) for the recumbent saline infusion test, 4 studies (633 participants) for the seated saline infusion test, 2 studies (99 participants) for the salt loading test, 7 studies (386 participants) for the fludrocortisone suppression test, and 25 studies (2,585 participants) for the captopril challenge test. The risk of bias was high, affecting more than half of the studies across all domains. Studies with case-control sampling overestimated accuracy by 7-fold (relative diagnostic odds ratio, 7.26 [95% CI, 2.46–21.43]), and partial verification or use of inconsistent reference standards overestimated accuracy by 5-fold (5.12 [95% CI, 1.48–17.77]). There were large variations in how confirmatory tests were conducted, interpreted, and verified. Under most scenarios, confirmatory testing resulted in an excess of missed cases. The certainty of evidence underlying each test was low.

### Update in primary aldosteronism [^112y1742]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Low credibility.

Primary aldosteronism (PA) is a condition worth detecting because it is a common cause of hypertension. It is associated with excessive morbidity for the degree of hypertension and reduced quality of life, all of which can be abrogated with specific surgical or medical treatment. Recent years have seen an increase in knowledge concerning the genetic bases of this disorder, particularly somatic mutations associated with aldosterone-producing adenomas and germline mutations causing rare familial forms. Both involve genes encoding ion channels.

Inroads have also been made into understanding molecular pathways that may be involved in the development of PA. With evidence continuing to grow for non-blood pressure-dependent adverse effects of aldosterone excess and for superior effects of specific over non-specific treatment, the need for accurate yet readily applicable and available diagnostic approaches has become urgent. Advances in confirmatory testing, subtype differentiation, and assay methodology are improving the feasibility and reliability of the diagnostic workup for PA, and new treatment approaches are emerging.

### Treating primary aldosteronism-induced hypertension: Novel approaches and future outlooks [^116zB41q]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). Low credibility.

Typically, low screening rates for PA are matched with less awareness of specific guidelines for its diagnosis and management (such as those of the Endocrine Society), and a greater reliance on more general hypertension guidelines (which are frequently more treat-to-target oriented). In addition, screening for PA in a primary care setting may be particularly challenging (e.g. when there is restricted access to aldosterone and renin assays). Even where available, screening is often not routinely deployed. The reasons for this are likely multifactorial and include clinician and/or patient reluctance to countenance withdrawal of potential confounding antihypertensive agents because of the fear of loss of BP control, coupled with a lack of familiarity with alternative noninterfering medications.

These "roadblocks" were highlighted in a qualitative study that probed the experience of 16 general practitioners in screening for PA where knowledge gaps, practical limitations of performing the ARR, and errors in diagnostic reasoning were the main challenges associated with routine PA screening. As a result of low screening and a lack of awareness of PA, patients are often hypertensive for many years (e.g. 5–20) before BP that is suboptimally controlled on multiple agents triggers the necessary investigations to permit the diagnosis. While PA is both a curable and treatable form of hypertension, the effectiveness of targeted intervention may be significantly attenuated by a late diagnosis.

### Is it possible to screen for primary aldosteronism effectively in primary care [^111rgRGn]. Clinical Endocrinology (2025). Low credibility.

Primary aldosteronism (PA) is the most common secondary cause of hypertension, accounting for 10–15% of patients with hypertension and at least 25% of patients with resistant hypertension. Hyperaldosteronism increases the risk of cardiovascular and renal disease through blood pressure-dependent and independent mechanisms; however, it remains under-recognized, largely due to insufficient screening.

The aldosterone to renin ratio (ARR) is the most widely used screening test for PA. In the UK, this is traditionally conducted through secondary care services. The potential role of primary care screening for PA is increasingly recognized and has been reported in several other countries, with detection rates ranging from 0.7% to 14%. This variability is, at least partly, due to heterogeneity in screening criteria, test methodology, and use of different cut-off thresholds.

Primary care PA screening has been available in Oxfordshire since 2008. We aimed to analyze the primary care PA screening practices, referral pathways, PA detection rate, and correlation and concordance between primary care and secondary care screening.

### Treating primary aldosteronism-induced hypertension: Novel approaches and future outlooks [^116UNPJx]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). Low credibility.

Similarly, the gold standard status of confirmatory testing has recently been called into question in a comprehensive meta-analysis (55 studies; 7,357 patients) of the four commonly used investigations: SIT, salt-loading test, fludrocortisone suppression test, and captopril challenge test. In analyses of the recumbent SIT (26 studies), seated SIT (4 studies), oral salt-loading test (2 studies), fludrocortisone suppression test (7 studies), and captopril challenge test (25 studies), the authors concluded that overall there was a low standard of evidence to support the use of confirmatory testing in PA. Specifically, the majority of studies demonstrated significant verification and spectrum bias, which led to an overestimation of test accuracy (by 5- to 7-fold) with an excess of missed cases, such that many patients were overlooked for treatment. Of particular concern was the finding that verification of the true diagnosis of PA varied across the study spectrum with inconsistent reference standards. Acknowledging the limitations highlighted within this meta-analysis, the fludrocortisone challenge test demonstrated the best performance as a confirmatory test, followed by the recumbent SIT and the captopril challenge test.

In summary, a high-quality, common gold standard to calibrate diagnostic testing is currently absent in the field of PA, and this, in turn, challenges the estimation of PA prevalence in general. It is clearly important that consensus is reached among the expert community as to what constitutes a positive screen to trigger confirmatory testing for PA.

### Roles of clinical criteria, computed tomography scan, and adrenal vein sampling in differential diagnosis of primary aldosteronism subtypes [^112aSyE5]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism (2008). Low credibility.

In patients with primary aldosteronism (PA), it is fundamental to distinguish between subtypes that benefit from different therapies. Computed tomography (CT) scans lack sensitivity and specificity and must be followed by adrenal venous sampling (AVS). Because AVS is not widely available, a list of clinical criteria that indicate the presence of an aldosterone-producing adenoma (APA) has been suggested.

- **Objective and design**: The objective of the study was to test the sensitivity and specificity of the last generation CT scans, test prospectively the usefulness of clinical criteria in the diagnosis of APA, and develop a flow chart to be used when AVS is not easily available.

- **Setting**: Hypertensive patients referred to our hypertension unit were included in our study.

- **Patients**: Seventy-one patients with confirmed PA participated in our study.

- **Intervention**: All patients had a CT scan and underwent AVS.

- **Main outcome measure**: Final diagnosis of APA was the main measure.

Results showed that a total of 44% of patients were diagnosed as having an APA and 56% as having bilateral adrenal hyperplasia (BAH). Twenty percent of patients with PA displayed hypokalemia. CT scans displayed a sensitivity of 0.87 and a specificity of 0.71. The posture test displayed a lower sensitivity and specificity (0.64 and 0.70, respectively). The distribution grades of hypertension were not significantly different between APA and BAH. Biochemical criteria of a high probability of APA displayed a sensitivity of 0.32 and a specificity of 0.95.

In conclusion, this study underlines the central role of combining clinical criteria with CT scans and AVS in diagnosing APA within PA patients.

The 2020 guidelines from Hypertension Canada (HC) recommend obtaining adrenal venous sampling for diagnosing primary aldosteronism, specifically for assessing aldosterone hypersecretion lateralization. This procedure should be performed exclusively by experienced teams working in specialized centers and is indicated for patients with primary aldosteronism and a definite adrenal mass eligible for surgery.

Approaches and challenges in the diagnosis and management of primary aldosteronism

Primary aldosteronism (PA) is a common but under-recognized cause of hypertension. Hypertension is the single greatest cause of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, affecting over 1 billion adults worldwide and up to 30% of certain adult populations. While primary hypertension, where no clear cause is identified, accounts for the majority (70–85%) of cases, 15% to 30% of patients have an identifiable endocrine or renal cause, known as secondary hypertension.

PA is the most common secondary cause of hypertension, with an estimated prevalence between 3.2% and 14% among primary care populations, increasing to 10% to 20% in hospital outpatient settings. Significant challenges exist in screening and diagnosing PA; therefore, estimates of prevalence may be modest in the overall context of the disease. Despite its commonality as a secondary cause of hypertension, PA has not been a key consideration in the design of over 40 randomized control trials which have investigated the management of hypertension over the past 30 years. Consequently, screening rates for PA remain low, clinical recognition is poor, and hypertension guidelines do not emphasize the need to investigate for PA in patients presenting with hypertension to their primary care physicians or general internists.

### Primary aldosteronism: Evidence against a second epidemic [^112sW9yF]. Journal of Hypertension (2012). Low credibility.

Primary aldosteronism is widely considered to be the most common cause of identifiable (secondary) hypertension, reported to be present in 6–10% of all hypertensive patients. This belief stems from the widespread use of the aldosterone-to-renin ratio (ARR) as a screening test. Unfortunately, the ARR is often inaccurate, leading to more expensive testing that can also be misleading, potentially resulting in harmful additional measures. This review provides evidence that referral bias has markedly inflated estimates of this condition. It recommends a much less aggressive approach to diagnosis based on more limited testing and the use of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists in the treatment of most hypertensive patients.

### Treating primary aldosteronism-induced hypertension: Novel approaches and future outlooks [^111vHd8b]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). High credibility.

- **Novel treatment approaches**:

Partial adrenalectomy involves targeted tumor resection as an alternative to complete unilateral adrenalectomy, which is often the treatment of choice for unilateral primary aldosteronism (UPA). This procedure is generally well-tolerated, safe, and effective for treating unilateral disease. With laparoscopic and retroperitoneoscopic approaches, it is usually a quick and relatively uncomplicated procedure, often requiring only a short hospital stay. However, there are some drawbacks to complete adrenalectomy.

Firstly, adrenalectomy has traditionally been considered in lateralized cases with an apparent aldosterone-producing adenoma (APA), accounting for approximately 30% of primary aldosteronism (PA) patients. The remaining 70% of patients with bilateral disease rely on pharmacological intervention. Many patients with cardiorenal complications of PA often represent poor operative candidates. Additionally, patients with bilateral disease, even when localizable, do not normally undergo bilateral adrenalectomy due to inevitable and unacceptable postprocedural adrenocortical insufficiency.

Furthermore, up to 30% of patients undergoing unilateral adrenalectomy for PA demonstrate partial (often subclinical) or, less commonly, complete postprocedural glucocorticoid insufficiency. This is typically a temporary phenomenon in most instances. It is unclear whether this insufficiency is due to loss of adrenal volume or the presence of co-secretion of glucocorticoids from APAs. Nakada et al. have previously demonstrated a blunted response to stress in adrenalectomized patients when compared to control subjects.

Approach to lateralization

Lateralization, the process of discriminating between left and right adrenal causes of primary aldosteronism (PA), is commonly assessed as part of the diagnostic work-up (Fig. 1). However, challenges remain in more precisely localizing the site(s) of functioning lesion(s) responsible for unregulated aldosterone secretion. Guidelines recommend that the invasive procedure adrenal vein sampling (AVS) be performed in the majority of patients being considered for surgery, to discriminate between unilateral and bilateral causes of PA and to identify the affected adrenal in unilateral PA (UPA). AVS is therefore considered the gold standard for lateralization, and the use of cross-sectional (anatomical) imaging, such as computed tomography (CT), alone is not generally advised. Conventional AVS does not specifically localize disease within the adrenal but instead lateralizes to the entire gland.

- **Adrenal vein sampling procedure**: A sampling catheter is inserted in either the left or right femoral vein for sampling the left and right adrenal vein in the presence or absence of cosyntropin stimulation. Aldosterone and cortisol are sampled from locations 1–3, and for each location, the aldosterone to cortisol ratio is calculated. Together, these values are used to determine:
	- **Selectivity index**: Ensures sampling occurred from the correct location, i.e. right adrenal vein (RAV), left adrenal vein (LAV), and inferior vena cava (IVC).
	- **Lateralization**: Determines whether one or both adrenals are involved.

### Treating primary aldosteronism-induced hypertension: Novel approaches and future outlooks [^112bqSjy]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). High credibility.

Primary aldosteronism (PA) is the most common cause of secondary hypertension and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality when compared with blood pressure–matched cases of primary hypertension. Limitations in patient care stem from delayed recognition of the condition, limited access to key diagnostic procedures, and lack of a definitive therapy option for nonsurgical candidates. However, several recent advances have the potential to address these barriers to optimal care.

- **Diagnostic perspective**: Machine-learning algorithms have shown promise in the prediction of PA subtypes, while the development of noninvasive alternatives to adrenal vein sampling (including molecular positron emission tomography imaging) has made accurate localization of functioning adrenal nodules possible.

- **Selective approaches**: More selective approaches to targeting the causative aldosterone-producing adrenal adenoma/nodule (APA/APN) have emerged with the advent of partial adrenalectomy or precision ablation.

- **Novel pharmacological agents**: The development of novel pharmacological agents may help to mitigate off-target effects of aldosterone and improve clinical efficacy and outcomes.

Here, we consider how each of these innovations might change our approach to the patient with PA, to allow more tailored investigation and treatment plans, with corresponding improvement in clinical outcomes and resource utilization, for this highly prevalent disorder.

### Primary aldosteronism: State-of-the-art review [^112UsMwt]. American Journal of Hypertension (2022). High credibility.

We are witnessing a revolution in our understanding of primary aldosteronism (PA). In the past two decades, we have learned that PA is a highly prevalent syndrome largely attributable to pathogenic somatic mutations. It contributes to cardiovascular, metabolic, and kidney disease, and when recognized, can be adequately treated with widely available mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists and/or surgical adrenalectomy. Unfortunately, PA is rarely diagnosed or adequately treated, mainly because of a lack of awareness and education.

Most clinicians still possess an outdated understanding of PA. From primary care physicians to hypertension specialists, there is an urgent need to redefine and reintroduce PA to clinicians with a modern and practical approach. In this state-of-the-art review, we provide readers with the most updated knowledge on the pathogenesis, prevalence, diagnosis, and treatment of PA. In particular, we underscore the public health importance of promptly recognizing and treating PA and provide pragmatic solutions to modify clinical practices to achieve this.

For all PET radiotracers, their sensitivity and performance is likely to be enhanced in patients with more severe disease phenotypes. Therefore, further prospective studies, including comparisons with AVS, will need to evaluate their accuracy in more subtle disease phenotypes. At a more basic level, the selection of novel candidate radiotracers for molecular imaging in primary aldosteronism (PA) is likely to be informed by further improvements in our understanding of the pathophysiology of the different subtypes of PA.

In the emerging world of multi-omics, and given the rich metabolomic potential of PA, the prospect of using molecular imaging in the context of radiomics, radiometabolomics, or radiogenomics to identify and lateralize functioning aldosterone-producing lesions offers an exciting glimpse of future possibilities.

### Primary aldosteronism: Renaissance of a syndrome [^117K8Mav]. Clinical Endocrinology (2007). Low credibility.

Great strides have been made in our understanding of the pathophysiology of primary aldosteronism syndrome since Conn's description of the clinical presentation of a patient with an aldosterone-producing adenoma (APA) more than 50 years ago. It is now recognized that the APA is just one of the seven subtypes of primary aldosteronism. APA and bilateral idiopathic hyperaldosteronism (IHA) are the most common subtypes of primary aldosteronism.

Although most clinicians had thought primary aldosteronism to be a rare form of hypertension for more than three decades, it is now recognized to be the most common form of secondary hypertension. Using the plasma aldosterone to plasma renin activity ratio as a case-finding test, followed by aldosterone suppression confirmatory testing, has resulted in much higher prevalence estimates of 5% to 13% of all patients with hypertension.

In addition, there has been a new recognition of the aldosterone-specific cardiovascular morbidity and mortality associated with aldosterone excess. Although thought to be daunting and complex in the past, the diagnostic approach to primary aldosteronism is straightforward and can be considered in three phases:

- **Case-finding tests**:

- **Confirmatory tests**:

- **Subtype evaluation tests**:

Patients with hypertension and hypokalaemia (regardless of presumed cause), treatment-resistant hypertension (three antihypertensive drugs and poor control), severe hypertension (≥ 160 mmHg systolic or ≥ 100 mmHg diastolic), hypertension and an incidental adrenal mass, onset of hypertension at a young age, or patients being evaluated.

### A comprehensive review of the clinical aspects of primary aldosteronism [^111iW9bQ]. Nature Reviews Endocrinology (2011). Low credibility.

Primary aldosteronism is much more common than previously thought. The high prevalence of primary aldosteronism, along with the damage this condition causes to the heart, blood vessels, and kidneys — which results in a high rate of cardiovascular events — emphasizes the importance of timely diagnosis and appropriate therapy. Such measures can correct arterial hypertension and hypokalemia, justifying efforts to search for primary aldosteronism in many patients with hypertension.

Most centers can use a cost-effective strategy to screen for patients with primary aldosteronism. However, the identification of primary aldosteronism subtypes, which involves adrenal-vein sampling, should only be undertaken at tertiary referral centers that have experience performing and interpreting this test. Identifying a curable form of primary aldosteronism can be beneficial for the patient.

In some subgroups of patients with hypertension who are at high risk of primary aldosteronism, or who might benefit most from an accurate diagnosis, an aggressive diagnostic approach is necessary.

### Treating primary aldosteronism-induced hypertension: Novel approaches and future outlooks [^115LYFaZ]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). Low credibility.

Several advances have occurred in the research and clinical research space that point to improved methodologies for lateralization and localization of APA, with the potential to significantly reduce, and perhaps even supersede, our reliance on AVS. To fully capitalize on these developments, it is crucial that further high-quality evidence is generated in the fields of molecular imaging and radiomics to facilitate this transition.

For now, it seems that CT imaging alone, as currently performed and analyzed (without the application of radiomics), is an inferior alternative to AVS, except in a small number of clinical contexts. In contrast, emerging data from studies with several different PET radiotracers suggest that molecular imaging offers the possibility of delivering a step-change in the management of PA, even potentially replacing AVS as the lateralization standard. This transition will not happen immediately, and any change in practice will require sufficient prospective evidence to justify such change. Nonetheless, the fact that molecular imaging is a noninvasive modality, which is faster and more easily interpretable, which can precisely localize lesions within the gland and can be performed without the technical challenges associated with AVS, confers significant advantages. Initially, we envisage that with greater availability of molecular imaging, PET CT may become the first-line lateralizing procedure — perhaps even performed as the initial radiological investigation (i.e. without prior CT) because of its ability to perform effectively without additional complexities.

### How common is primary aldosteronism [^113H8UP3]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2021). Low credibility.

Primary aldosteronism, characterized by renin-independent aldosterone secretion from one or both adrenal glands, is the most common and modifiable form of secondary hypertension. The prevalence of primary aldosteronism is increasingly recognized to be much higher than previously thought, with many cases still undetected.

- **Recent findings**: Prior prevalence studies on primary aldosteronism have reported a wide range of estimates due to the heterogeneity of both disease definitions and study populations, making it difficult to claim a single point estimate. More recent evidence demonstrates that primary aldosteronism, as defined by conventional biochemical diagnostic criteria, is highly prevalent within populations where it is not typically considered, such as mild-to-moderate hypertension, prehypertension, and even normotension. Yet, our screening approach fails to capture many cases. Furthermore, there is mounting evidence that renin-independent aldosteronism exists as a continuum of disease that extends below the biochemical diagnostic thresholds used to define primary aldosteronism and has clinically relevant treatment and outcome implications for a much broader patient population. Indeed, much of what we label as 'essential hypertension' is, in fact, renin-independent aldosterone-mediated hypertension.

Primary aldosteronism and milder forms of renin-independent aldosteronism are highly prevalent, yet vastly under-recognized, in the general population.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for primary aldosteronism, more specifically with respect to the plasma aldosterone-to-renin ratio, initial testing according to the ES 2025 guidelines recommends measuring serum/plasma aldosterone and plasma renin (concentration or activity) in the morning with patients seated and avoiding dietary sodium restriction during the few days prior to screening. Obtain potassium levels to aid in the accurate interpretation of aldosterone, as low potassium may lead to a falsely low aldosterone.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for primary aldosteronism, specifically concerning confirmatory testing, the Hypertension Canada 2020 guidelines recommend establishing a diagnosis of autonomous hypersecretion of aldosterone if any of the following criteria are met (holding interfering drugs as outlined above):

- **Saline loading tests**: Administer 2 L of normal saline IV over 4 hours with the patient in a recumbent position (contraindicated in the presence of severe, uncontrolled hypertension or congestive heart failure). Define primary aldosteronism (PA) as a postinfusion plasma aldosterone > 280 pmol/L. Recognize that PA is unlikely if administered > 200 mmol/day of oral sodium (equivalent to > 5 g/day of sodium, > 12 g/day of sodium chloride, or > 2 teaspoons/day of salt) for 3 days. Define PA as a 24-hour urinary aldosterone > 33 nmol/day (measured from the morning of day 3 to the morning of day 4). Recognize that PA is unlikely with plasma aldosterone < 1400 pmol/L/ng/mL/hour (or < 270 pmol/L/ng/L), with a plasma aldosterone > 440 pmol/L.

- **Captopril suppression test**: Administer 25–50 mg captopril orally after the patient has been sitting or standing for 1 hour. Measure renin and plasma aldosterone levels while seated at time 0 and 1–2 hours after ingestion. Recognize that PA is unlikely if plasma aldosterone is suppressed by > 30% after captopril ingestion. Recognize that plasma aldosterone levels remain elevated in PA, while renin levels remain suppressed.

### An individualized approach to the evaluation and management of primary aldosteronism [^117UrvkC]. Endocrine Practice (2017). Low credibility.

With the increased emphasis on personalized and individualized medicine, the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists Adrenal Scientific Committee has developed a series of articles to update members on personalized medicine as it applies to adrenal diseases.

- **Methods**: We synthesized literature reviews, guidelines from professional societies, and personal experience.

- **Results**: Since Conn described primary aldosteronism (PA) over 60 years ago, debate has raged about the prevalence of PA in the hypertensive population, the wisdom of broadly screening for PA, and prudent approaches to evaluate and manage these patients. Accumulated data from multiple centers around the globe have begun to crystallize the clinical characteristics of these patients, which allows for an individualized approach before the diagnosis of PA is even established. Evidence-based criteria for screening, improved and widely available clinical assays, and validated algorithms for evaluation empower all endocrinologists to address this complex disease effectively.

- **Conclusion**: Breakthroughs in the pathogenesis and evolution of PA illustrate why our thinking about this disease must remain flexible: PA is not a rare and uniform condition, but rather a common syndrome with protean manifestations.
