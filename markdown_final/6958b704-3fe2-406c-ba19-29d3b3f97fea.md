## Question

What are the indications for cataract surgery in patients with comorbidities?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about determining indications for cataract surgery in patients with comorbidities. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the overarching indication framework and when cataract surgery improves visual function. Then, I should verify how systemic comorbidities alter preoperative risk, anesthesia planning, and whether surgery is safe to proceed. Next, I will examine disease-specific comorbidities that modify surgical strategy, including glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, macular degeneration, uveitis, corneal disease, and amblyopia. After that, I should review special populations such as the functionally monocular, very elderly, and infants. Finally, I will integrate a practical decision algorithm, clarify documentation and counseling, and double-check the role and limits of preoperative testing, before concluding with key principles that align with high-quality guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the foundational indication: cataract surgery is indicated when visual function no longer meets the patient's needs and there is a reasonable likelihood of improvement; surgery is also indicated for clinically significant anisometropia, interference with diagnosis or management of posterior segment disease, lens-induced inflammation or secondary glaucoma, and lens-related angle closure, while it should not be performed if refractive correction suffices, no improvement is expected, the patient cannot safely undergo surgery, adequate postoperative care cannot be arranged, or informed consent cannot be obtained, as summarized in AAO 2024 Summary Benchmarks and the 2022 Preferred Practice Pattern [^115mfdgC] [^116BwmX8] [^116K7hjX].

> Wait, let me verify the principle of "reasonable likelihood of improvement": guidelines emphasize that absolute visual acuity thresholds are not appropriate, and patient-reported visual function and quality-of-life gains often occur even when Snellen acuity is relatively preserved; I should confirm that both guidelines and outcomes studies support surgery in symptomatic patients with preoperative acuity better than 20/50, and yes, PPPs and PROM-based studies show clinically meaningful improvements independent of Snellen thresholds, reinforcing that symptom-driven, function-first indications are correct [^115mfdgC] [^111YBxRU] [^111cYX5G].

> I need to ensure that systemic comorbidities do not automatically preclude surgery; hold on, let's not jump to conclusions, because routine preoperative medical testing has not reduced perioperative adverse events in large randomized trials and should be avoided, with selective testing guided by history and examination; however, unstable cardiovascular disease, poorly controlled hypertension, severe heart failure, or decompensated diabetes warrant optimization and coordination with primary care, and MAC or oral sedation strategies can be tailored for frail or anxious patients, so I should double-check that both Cochrane and AAO endorse this approach, which they do [^1116MLjm] [^113bQ5Aw] [^112rNrgM] [^111XGKjp] [^116i5gUs].

> Next, I should review glaucoma, because this is where comorbidity most clearly changes surgical planning; let me think about IOP effects first: cataract surgery alone typically lowers IOP by about 2–4 mmHg and reduces medication burden, though combined cataract–glaucoma surgery achieves greater IOP reduction than cataract alone; MIGS options like iStent or excisional goniotomy can be added in mild-to-moderate disease, but I should confirm that the choice of combined versus cataract-alone remains individualized and that a pre-existing bleb may be compromised by cataract surgery, which AAO and Cochrane both acknowledge [^111HLC9E] [^111u111s] [^111pXjtL] [^117GMMSK] [^112ZmLBv].

> Hold on, I should verify how diabetic retinopathy modifies the plan; diabetes is associated with poor dilation, slower healing, and higher risks of postoperative macular edema, so I need to ensure retinopathy is optimally treated before elective surgery and consider OCT-guided perioperative management; importantly, cataract surgery does not appear to increase progression risk when DR/DME is adequately treated, but inadequately treated DME is a key risk, and for mature cataracts obscuring the fundus, innovative intraoperative approaches or coordinated anti-VEGF can mitigate delays in DME management; let me double-check that AAO supports OCT-based perioperative planning and the risk signal for undertreated DME, which it does [^115Qjp3n] [^117Gs3jP] [^113DSfhD].

> I will now examine AMD, since patients and clinicians often worry about progression; wait, I initially thought there was high-certainty evidence of harm, but I should double-check that; in fact, high-quality randomized data are limited and observational signals conflict, with some studies showing no increased progression and others suggesting pre-existing disease may have been missed preoperatively; AAO notes that OCT and angiography can stage disease and set expectations but do not predict visual potential, and short-term RCTs suggest vision gains without clear progression signal, so individualized counseling on expected gains and residual deficits is essential [^116LNnPw] [^113QxyiZ] [^111BSHUw] [^111cYX5G].

> Let me consider uveitis, where timing and anti-inflammatory control are critical; I should confirm that quiescence for at least 3 months is recommended when feasible, with preoperative intensification of topical and often systemic steroids to mitigate CME and flare, and I need to check lens material nuances; evidence suggests hydrophobic acrylic lenses may reduce posterior synechiae versus silicone in some cohorts, though overall differences in visual outcomes are uncertain, so perioperative anti-inflammatory strategy and IOL selection should be individualized and coordinated with the uveitis specialist [^111A6Wup] [^116CYtZF] [^112GW9yT].

> I should confirm considerations for Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy and other endothelial disease; morning blur and slit-lamp edema signal higher decompensation risk, so using dispersive viscoelastic, minimizing ultrasound energy, and considering combined cataract–endothelial keratoplasty in more advanced cases are reasonable; I need to remember that EK can induce a hyperopic shift, which complicates IOL planning, and AAO supports this stratified approach with explicit consent about corneal failure risk [^114F6Xn4].

> But wait, what if amblyopia is present; I should verify that expectations are tempered because visual potential is limited by cortical factors, yet removing the cataract can still improve functional vision and binocular balance; amblyopia management principles still apply, and the PPP reminds us that deprivation amblyopia from unilateral cataract is hard to treat, so preoperative counseling on residual deficits is key [^1146Nf23] [^1115go76].

> Next, I should review special populations; functionally monocular patients have the same indications but often merit earlier intervention and closer follow-up, including examination within 24 hours postoperatively, given risk and dependence; very elderly patients, even those over 85, can achieve meaningful gains with complication rates similar to younger cohorts after accounting for comorbidity, so age alone should not be a barrier; infants with congenital cataract require urgent surgery to prevent deprivation amblyopia, with primary IOL implantation and timing affecting postoperative glaucoma risk, so I need to ensure timely referral and long-term glaucoma surveillance plans [^116s7FBd] [^113GsMez] [^114KkZ8m] [^111S9P56].

> Let me synthesize a practical decision framework, but I should double-check it aligns with guideline anchors: first, confirm a cataract is the primary cause of visual disability and that function is below patient needs; second, screen for comorbidities that alter safety, anesthesia, and strategy; third, if comorbidity is present, tailor the plan — for example, MIGS with cataract for mild-to-moderate glaucoma, preoperative OCT/anti-VEGF coordination for diabetic eye disease, disease-staged AMD counseling, uveitis quiescence and steroid optimization, and endothelial protection or combined EK when indicated; fourth, set realistic expectations and document risks, benefits, and alternatives; finally, schedule appropriate postoperative follow-up intensity, including early checks for high-risk or monocular patients [^115mfdgC] [^117Gs3jP] [^117GMMSK] [^114F6Xn4] [^113GsMez].

> I need to ensure preoperative testing is evidence-aligned; routine lab work or ECG does not improve safety and increases cost, so selective testing should be guided by history and exam; a validated self-administered health questionnaire can identify comorbidities as accurately as a physician history for predicting adverse events in many cases, which can streamline care without compromising safety; let me verify that AAO PPP and Cochrane support this selective, value-based approach, which they do [^1116MLjm] [^112rNrgM] [^111tATJu].

> Next, I should review anesthesia and perioperative medical optimization; most cataract surgeries proceed with topical or regional anesthesia with minimal or no sedation, and oral benzodiazepine sedation can be noninferior to IV sedation in appropriately selected low-risk patients, while MAC remains an option when deeper sedation is needed; hold on, I should verify the systemic risk framing: professional anesthesia guidance and population data support cataract surgery as extremely low risk, with most adverse events cardiovascular and intraoperative but not mitigated by routine pre-op testing, reinforcing selective rather than blanket medical workups [^111XGKjp] [^1156W9Tq] [^115UfTHF].

> I should double-check documentation and counseling requirements: the operating ophthalmologist should perform or supervise the preoperative assessment, confirm the indication, review refractive goals and IOL options, discuss comorbidity-specific risks and expected visual outcomes, and confirm informed consent; postoperative plans should be explicit, including timing of first follow-up, which should be within 24 hours for functionally monocular or high-risk patients and within 48 hours for routine cases, with contingency access for complications [^112fZ9ki] [^113GsMez].

> Let me reconsider key principles to ensure internal consistency: visual function drives indication, not Snellen acuity alone; comorbidities often modify technique and expectations but rarely constitute absolute contraindications; individualized, patient-centered decisions and transparent counseling improve outcomes; and delaying surgery until the cataract is very advanced can increase risk and slow recovery, so timely intervention is prudent when the indication is present [^115mfdgC] [^111vrxny].

Cataract surgery is indicated when visual function no longer meets the patient's needs and there is a reasonable likelihood of improvement [^116BwmX8] [^115mfdgC]. In patients with comorbidities, **indications remain the same**, but **timing and planning must be individualized** to optimize safety and outcomes [^115Qjp3n] [^112pDdox]. Key considerations include:

- **Glaucoma**: Combined cataract-glaucoma surgery may be preferred if IOP control is needed [^112ZmLBv]; cataract surgery alone can lower IOP [^111HLC9E] but less than combined procedures [^111pXjtL].

- **Diabetic retinopathy**: Surgery is appropriate when retinopathy is stabilized; active macular edema or proliferative disease should be treated preoperatively to reduce progression risk [^117Gs3jP].

- **AMD**: Cataract surgery improves vision in AMD patients [^111juty9]; preoperative imaging helps set expectations and detect occult choroidal neovascularization [^111BSHUw].

- **Uveitis**: Surgery should proceed only after inflammation is controlled for ≥ 3 months [^111A6Wup]; perioperative steroids reduce complications [^116CYtZF].

- **Systemic comorbidities**: Most patients can safely undergo surgery with local anesthesia; unstable cardiovascular, pulmonary, or renal conditions should be optimized preoperatively [^111XGKjp] [^115Qjp3n].

Routine preoperative medical testing is not required [^1116MLjm]; selective testing is based on history and exam [^112rNrgM]. Surgery should be deferred if **risks outweigh benefits** or if postoperative care cannot be arranged [^116K7hjX].

Introduction

Cataract accounts for over 47% of blindness worldwide, causing blindness in about 17.3 million people in 1990. Surgery for cataract in people with glaucoma may affect glaucoma control.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of surgery for age-related cataract without other ocular comorbidity? What are the effects of treatment for age-related cataract in people with glaucoma? What are the effects of surgical treatments for age-related cataract in people with diabetic retinopathy? What are the effects of surgical treatments for age-related cataract in people with chronic uveitis? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to May 2010 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 20 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: for people with cataract without other ocular co-morbidity: cataract surgery alone, cataract surgery with non-concomitant glaucoma surgery, concomitant cataract and glaucoma surgery, intracapsular extraction, manual (large or small) incision extracapsular extraction, and phaco extracapsular extraction; for people with cataract with co-morbid diabetic retinopathy: cataract surgery alone, and adding diabetic retinopathy treatment to cataract surgery; for people with cataract and co-morbid chronic uveitis: cataract surgery, and medical control of uveitis at the time of cataract surgery.

### Routine preoperative medical testing for cataract surgery [^1116MLjm]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Cataract surgery is practiced widely, and substantial resources are committed to an increasing cataract surgical rate in low- and middle-income countries. With the current volume of cataract surgery and future increases, it is critical to optimize the safety and cost-effectiveness of this procedure. Most cataracts are performed on older individuals with correspondingly high systemic and ocular comorbidities. It is likely that routine preoperative medical testing will detect medical conditions, but it is questionable whether these conditions should preclude individuals from cataract surgery or change their perioperative management.

Objectives

1. To investigate the evidence for reductions in adverse events through preoperative medical testing2. To estimate the average cost of performing routine medical testing SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register) (2018, Issue 6); Ovid MEDLINE; Embase.com; PubMed; LILACS BIREME, the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) (last searched 5 January 2012); ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO ICTRP. The date of the search was 29 June 2018, with the exception of mRCT which is no longer in service. We searched the references of reports from included studies for additional relevant studies without restrictions regarding language or date of publication.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized clinical trials in which routine preoperative medical testing was compared to no preoperative or selective preoperative testing prior to age-related cataract surgery.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed abstracts to identify possible trials for inclusion. For each included study, two review authors independently documented study characteristics, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias.

Main Results

We identified three randomized clinical trials that compared routine preoperative medical testing versus selective or no preoperative testing for 21,531 cataract surgeries. The largest trial, in which 19,557 surgeries were randomized, was conducted in Canada and the United States. Another study was conducted in Brazil and the third in Italy. Although the studies had some issues with respect to performance and detection bias due to lack of masking (high risk for one study, unclear for two studies), we assessed the studies as at overall low risk of bias. The three randomized clinical trials included in this review reported results for 21,531 total cataract surgeries with 707 total surgery-associated medical adverse events, including 61 hospitalizations and three deaths. Of the 707 medical adverse events reported, 353 occurred in the pre-testing group and 354 occurred in the no-testing group (odds ratio (OR) 1.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.86 to 1.16; high-certainty evidence). Most events were cardiovascular and occurred during the intraoperative period. Routine preoperative medical testing did not reduce the risk of intraoperative (OR 0.99, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.38) or postoperative ocular adverse events (OR 1.11, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.67) when compared to selective or no testing (2 studies; 2281 cataract surgeries; moderate-certainty evidence). One study evaluated cost savings, estimating the costs to be 2.55 times higher in those with preoperative medical testing compared to those without preoperative medical testing (1 study; 1005 cataract surgeries; moderate-certainty evidence). There was no difference in cancellation of surgery between those with preoperative medical testing and those with selective or no preoperative testing, reported by two studies with 20,582 cataract surgeries (OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.21; high-certainty evidence). No study reported outcomes related to clinical management changes (other than cancellation) or quality of life scores.

Authors' Conclusions

This review has shown that routine preoperative testing does not increase the safety of cataract surgery. Alternatives to routine preoperative medical testing have been proposed, including self administered health questionnaires, which could substitute for health provider histories and physical examinations. Such avenues may lead to cost-effective means of identifying those at increased risk of medical adverse events due to cataract surgery. However, despite the rare occurrence, adverse medical events precipitated by cataract surgery remain a concern because of the large number of elderly patients with multiple medical comorbidities who have cataract surgery in various settings. The studies summarized in this review should assist recommendations for the standard of care of cataract surgery, at least in low- and middle-income settings. Unfortunately, in these settings, medical history questionnaires may be useless to screen for risk because few people have ever been to a physician, let alone been diagnosed with any chronic disease.

Cataract in the adult eye — preoperative medical evaluation evidence: Patients undergoing cataract surgery frequently have a preoperative medical evaluation including a history and physical examination that takes into consideration the risk factors for undergoing the planned anesthesia; however, three randomized clinical trials have failed to show that this evaluation reduces systemic or ocular complications and no trials have shown it to be efficacious.

Systemic comorbidities — conditions relevant to cataract surgery and perioperative planning include diabetes mellitus, pulmonary dysfunction, cardiovascular dysfunction (e.g., poorly controlled blood pressure, heart failure), musculoskeletal disorders causing positional difficulties, tremor, severe hearing impairment, anxiety disorders, intellectual disability, dementia, and coagulopathies. For patients with complex medical conditions, it may be beneficial to coordinate care with the patient's primary care physician, and depending on the planned anesthesia and sedation, appropriate measures should be taken to stabilize and monitor the condition. Not only is diabetes a risk factor for early cataract development, it also leads to poor intraoperative pupillary dilation, slowed ocular surface healing, and an increased risk of postoperative macular edema.

Cataract in the Adult Eye — preoperative ocular comorbidities influence outcomes and counseling; "preoperative ocular comorbidities may adversely affect the outcome of cataract surgery". "Many comorbid conditions are associated with the potential for reduced improvement in visual function or CDVA, and the patient should be informed and counseled prior to surgery".

### Cataract in the adult eye preferred practice pattern [^112rNrgM]. Ophthalmology (2022). High credibility.

Preoperative evaluation and testing for cataract surgery — medical assessment and laboratory testing guidance indicates that a preoperative medical evaluation by the patient's primary care physician or a dedicated preoperative service may be considered, while routine preoperative laboratory testing in association with the history and physical examination is not indicated. A very large, prospective, randomized clinical trial demonstrated that routine medical testing did not reduce perioperative morbidity and mortality; despite this finding, routine medical testing is still performed on many Medicare recipients, and directed testing may be recommended as appropriate for a particular surgical candidate with medical problems.

### A preoperative medical history and physical should not Be a requirement for all cataract patients [^1168P7TA]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Cataract surgery poses minimal systemic medical risk, yet a preoperative general medical history and physical is required by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and other regulatory bodies within 1 month of cataract surgery. Based on prior research and practice guidelines, there is professional consensus that preoperative laboratory testing confers no benefit when routinely performed on cataract surgical patients. Such testing remains commonplace. Although not yet tested in a large-scale trial, there is also no evidence that the required history and physical yields a benefit for most cataract surgical patients above and beyond the screening performed by anesthesia staff on the day of surgery. We propose that the minority of patients who might benefit from a preoperative medical history and physical can be identified prospectively. Regulatory agencies should not constrain medical practice in a way that adds enormous cost and patient burden in the absence of value.

### Does standalone phacoemulsification lower intraocular pressure in glaucomatous eyes? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^111HLC9E]. Eye (2025). Medium credibility.

Summary

What is known about this top

Coexisting glaucoma and cataract are common in older individuals, particularly those over the age of 60.
Given the frequent concurrence of these conditions, cataract surgery presents a unique opportunity to assess its effect on IOP changes and glaucoma progression.

What this study adds

Our study aimed to evaluate the reliability of phacoemulsification in reducing both IOP and the need for glaucoma medications in glaucoma patients through a systematic review and meta-analysis.
Standalone phacoemulsification significantly lowers IOP and reduces the need for glaucoma medications in patients with glaucoma.

### Cataract in the adult eye preferred practice pattern [^112pDdox]. Ophthalmology (2022). High credibility.

Cataract in the adult eye — preoperative evaluation and counseling (planning, comorbidities, blepharoptosis, communication, and responsibilities): The ophthalmologist who will perform cataract surgery should do the following, including consider the effect of ocular comorbidities; formulate a plan including preoperative medical management, selection of appropriate anesthesia, surgical approach, concurrent procedures, and IOL design and power; assess relevant mental and physical status such as the ability to cooperate and position for surgery; formulate a postoperative care plan and inform the patient or surrogate of arrangements; determine the effect of any concurrent upper-eyelid blepharoptosis, noting that blepharoptosis can induce corneal astigmatism or make astigmatism more difficult to measure and that cataract surgery can worsen blepharoptosis; answer the patient's questions including associated costs; assess barriers to communication, including language or hearing impairment; and ensure that the patient and caregiver, if applicable, are committed and able to attend postoperative visits and address transportation, medication administration, and other potential challenges; ideally, the operating ophthalmologist should perform the preoperative assessment, although certain aspects of data collection may be conducted by other trained team members under the ophthalmologist's supervision and with his or her review.

### Cataract / anterior segment summary benchmark – 2024 [^113GsMez]. AAO (2024). High credibility.

Cataract postoperative follow-up evaluation — Functionally monocular and high-risk patients should be seen within 24 hours of surgery, while routine patients should be seen within 48 hours of surgery. Frequency and timing of subsequent visits depend on incision characteristics, suture removal needs, and stabilization of refraction, visual function, and the eye's medical condition, with more frequent follow-up usually necessary for high risk patients. Components of each postoperative exam should include interval history (new symptoms, postoperative medications, and self-assessment of vision), measurement of visual function, measurement of intraocular pressure (IOP), slit-lamp biomicroscopy, counseling/education, and provision of a management plan. The operating ophthalmologist has ultimate responsibility for preoperative assessment and postoperative care, has an ethical obligation that continues until postoperative rehabilitation is complete, should provide postoperative care within the ophthalmologist's unique competence, and patients should always have access to an ophthalmologist for appropriate care if serious problems arise.

### Refractive surgery preferred practice pattern ® [^115MDfWV]. Ophthalmology (2023). High credibility.

Postoperative follow-up after cataract surgery — postoperative patients with low-risk surgeries and with no signs or symptoms of possible complications should be seen within the first 48 hours of surgery, whereas functionally monocular patients and those at high risk of early postoperative complications should be seen within the first 24 hours of surgery. For the routine patient, omitting an examination on the day after uncomplicated cataract surgery is associated with a low frequency of serious ocular complications. In patients with low-risk, uncomplicated cataract surgery who are seen within 1 day of surgery and remain asymptomatic, a subsequent visit 1 week later rarely serves to change management; however, this visit may increase medication compliance. More-frequent postoperative visits are generally indicated if unusual findings, symptoms, or complications occur, and the patient should have ready access to the ophthalmologist's office to ask questions or seek care.

### Cataract surgery outcomes in the very elderly [^114KkZ8m]. Journal of Cataract and Refractive Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

The prevalence of very elderly patients (aged 85 years and older) with visually significant cataracts continues to rise in the United States. We conducted a focused review of literature using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines to investigate the impact of very old age on cataract surgery outcomes. The studies suggest that very elderly patients, relative to their younger counterparts, had similar complication rates after adjusting for their higher rates of age-related ocular and systemic comorbidities. In addition, most very elderly patients gained improvement in visual acuity, enjoyed increased quality of life, and had survival rates that extend beyond 1 year after surgery. Although many of the studies were small and lacked statistical power to exclude clinically important differences in outcome, findings generally supported cataract surgery in the very elderly. Further studies are required to augment evidence-based surgical decision-making in elderly persons with ocular comorbidities and visually significant cataracts.

### Mobile health and postoperative self-care following glaucoma, cataract, or corneal transplant surgeries [^1117wxpe]. BMC Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

Cataract, the leading cause of blindness globally, is a condition marked by the clouding of the eye's natural lens and is commonly associated with aging, trauma, or certain systemic diseases. The primary treatment is surgical, involving the removal of the clouded lens and its replacement with an artificial intraocular lens. Although cataract surgery is among the safest and most effective ophthalmic procedures, its success is highly contingent upon strict adherence to postoperative care protocols. These include the regular use of antibiotic and anti-inflammatory eye drops, proper eye protection, and consistent follow-up with ophthalmologists. Neglecting these measures can result in complications such as infection, inflammation, and suboptimal surgical outcomes.

Corneal transplantation, or keratoplasty, is one of the most commonly performed surgical procedures for treating severe corneal diseases such as keratoconus, chronic infections, and trauma-induced damage. This complex surgical intervention requires meticulous postoperative care to prevent graft rejection, infection, and other complications. Appropriate care — including the correct use of immunosuppressive medications, avoidance of strenuous activities, and regular medical follow-ups plays a vital role in ensuring surgical success.

A common thread among glaucoma, cataract, and corneal transplant surgeries is that their success and long-term outcomes heavily depend on patients' adherence to postoperative care protocols. Non-compliance with these regimens may result in serious complications and, in some cases, surgical failure. Nevertheless, many patients struggle to follow postoperative instructions properly due to a variety of factors, including lack of awareness, forgetfulness, and limited access to reliable informational or support resources.

These three ophthalmic conditions were examined concurrently in this study for several reasons. First, all three are classified as major eye disorders that impose a substantial burden on healthcare systems. Second, there are notable similarities in the postoperative care requirements for these conditions, including the critical use of topical medications, prevention of infection and inflammation, and the necessity for regular follow-up examinations. Third, investigating these conditions collectively enables the development of a more comprehensive and practical postoperative management solution one that can accommodate a broader spectrum of patients.

### Combined surgery versus cataract surgery alone for eyes with cataract and glaucoma [^111pXjtL]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Cataract and glaucoma are leading causes of blindness worldwide, and their co-existence is common in elderly people. Glaucoma surgery can accelerate cataract progression, and performing both surgeries may increase the rate of postoperative complications and compromise the success of either surgery. However, cataract surgery may independently lower intraocular pressure (IOP), which may allow for greater IOP control among patients with co-existing cataract and glaucoma. The decision between undergoing combined glaucoma and cataract surgery versus cataract surgery alone is complex. Therefore, it is important to compare the effectiveness of these two interventions to aid clinicians and patients in choosing the better treatment approach.

Objectives

To assess the relative effectiveness and safety of combined surgery versus cataract surgery (phacoemulsification) alone for co-existing cataract and glaucoma. The secondary objectives include cost analyses for different surgical techniques for co-existing cataract and glaucoma.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group Trials Register) (2014, Issue 10), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily, Ovid OLDMEDLINE (January 1946 to October 2014), EMBASE (January 1980 to October 2014), PubMed (January 1948 to October 2014), Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature Database (LILACS) (January 1982 to October 2014), the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) (www.controlled-trials.com), ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov), and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 3 October 2014. We checked the reference lists of the included trials to identify further relevant trials. We used the Science Citation Index to search for references to publications that cited the studies included in the review. We also contacted investigators and experts in the field to identify additional trials.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of participants who had open-angle, pseudoexfoliative, or pigmentary glaucoma and age-related cataract. The comparison of interest was combined cataract surgery (phacoemulsification) and any type of glaucoma surgery versus cataract surgery (phacoemulsification) alone.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed study eligibility, collected data, and judged risk of bias for included studies. We used standard methodological procedures expected by the Cochrane Collaboration.

Main Results

We included nine RCTs, with a total of 655 participants (657 eyes), and follow-up periods ranging from 12 to 30 months. Seven trials were conducted in Europe, one in Canada and South Africa, and one in the United States. We graded the overall quality of the evidence as low due to observed inconsistency in study results, imprecision in effect estimates, and risks of bias in the included studies. Glaucoma surgery type varied among the studies: three studies used trabeculectomy, three studies used iStent® implants, one study used trabeculotomy, and two studies used trabecular aspiration. All of these studies found a statistically significant greater decrease in mean IOP postoperatively in the combined surgery group compared with cataract surgery alone; the mean difference (MD) was -1.62 mmHg (95% confidence interval (CI) -2.61 to -0.64; 489 eyes) among six studies with data at one year follow-up. No study reported the proportion of participants with a reduction in the number of medications used after surgery, but two studies found the mean number of medications used postoperatively at one year was about one less in the combined surgery group than the cataract surgery alone group (MD -0.69, 95% CI -1.28 to -0.10; 301 eyes). Five studies showed that participants in the combined surgery group were about 50% less likely compared with the cataract surgery alone group to use one or more IOP-lowering medications one year postoperatively (risk ratio (RR) 0.47, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.80; 453 eyes). None of the studies reported the mean change in visual acuity or visual fields. However, six studies reported no significant differences in visual acuity and two studies reported no significant differences in visual fields between the two intervention groups postoperatively (data not analyzable). The effect of combined surgery versus cataract surgery alone on the need for reoperation to control IOP at one year was uncertain (RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.15 to 8.25; 382 eyes). Also uncertain was whether eyes in the combined surgery group required more interventions for surgical complications than those in the cataract surgery alone group (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.34 to 3.35; 382 eyes). No study reported any vision-related quality of life data or cost outcome. Complications were reported at 12 months (two studies), 12 to 18 months (one study), and two years (four studies) after surgery. Due to the small number of events reported across studies and treatment groups, the difference between groups was uncertain for all reported adverse events.

Authors' Conclusions

There is low quality evidence that combined cataract and glaucoma surgery may result in better IOP control at one year compared with cataract surgery alone. The evidence was uncertain in terms of complications from the surgeries. Furthermore, this Cochrane review has highlighted the lack of data regarding important measures of the patient experience, such as visual field tests, quality of life measurements, and economic outcomes after surgery, and long-term outcomes (five years or more). Additional high-quality RCTs measuring clinically meaningful and patient-important outcomes are required to provide evidence to support treatment recommendations.

### Should we perform early cataract surgery? A patient reported outcome study [^111YBxRU]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Current guidance states that access to cataract surgery should not be restricted by visual acuity (VA); nevertheless, 6/12 is used as a cut-off criterion in some health institutions. This study aims to determine the benefits of performing cataract surgery in patients with VA of 6/9 or better in both eyes; determine whether these benefits change over time; and compare the benefit observed between early first eye and second eye surgery.

Patients and Methods

Fifty adults with VA at least 6/9 in the worst eye and no ocular comorbidity were recruited. The Visual Function Index (VF-14) and Impact of Visual Impairment (IVI) questionnaires were conducted pre-operatively, 4 months post-operatively, and 12 months post-operatively. The t -test or a non-parametric equivalent was used to compare averages between groups.

Results

The mean change in VF-14 from baseline to 4 months was 16.43 (95% CI 12.49–20.50, p < 0.001) and the median change in IVI was 6.5 (IQR 9.75, p < 0.001). There was no significant difference between 4-month and 12-month follow-up (p > 0.05). There was no significant difference in the change in visual function between the first and second eye surgery (p > 0.05).

Conclusion

This study provides evidence that visual function improves after cataract surgery in patients with pre-operative VA of 6/9 or better. The improvement observed was clinically significant and unchanged a year after surgery. Visual function improved after second eye as much as after first eye surgery. Assessing patient reported visual function may give a more realistic indication of the benefit of early cataract surgery than relying on VA alone.

### Minimally invasive surgery in mild-to-moderate glaucoma patients in Italy: is It time to change? [^1131QUcb]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Key-Decision Treatment Criteria in Glaucoma

The ultimate goal of glaucoma treatment is to minimize the optic nerve damage and to safeguard the residual visual field/capacity of patients. This can be achieved through sustained IOP reduction. The European Glaucoma Society (ESG) Guidelines (Year 2017) state that "there is not enough evidence to support any particular algorithm to set the target IOP". However, in clinical practice, identification of absolute IOP target reduction (< 21mmHg, < 18mmHg, etc.) and relative (vs baseline) IOP target reduction (≥ 20%, ≥ 30%, etc.) should depend on a multifactorial assessment of the patient. Figure 1 illustrates the main criteria driving the decision on IOP target level:

Figure 1
Main criteria for setting the target IOP°. °The above factors need to be considered as a whole in deciding the individual target pressure required. *Consider central corneal thickness.

Rate of Progression

Optimal management of glaucoma implies that patients would be monitored and staged regularly with both functional tests (visual field; staging classification based on Hodapp, Parish and Anderson; H-P-A) and structural tests. This approach would help ophthalmologists to accurately assess the disease progression rate, and to select the more appropriate treatment approach, with filtering surgery being preferred over medical therapy and/or minimally invasive approaches for highly progressing patients.

Glaucoma Damage

The more glaucoma is advanced, the higher is the need to target low IOP. Therefore, patients with significant glaucomatous damage require a more resolutive intervention to ensure that IOP would be significantly reduced and that residual visual field maintained.

Age/Life Expectancy

Likely, patients with early-onset are likely to manifest with glaucoma. In these cases, early intervention with effective, surgical treatment, is recommended to preserve visual functionality and avoid early visual impairment. Instead, for older patients, more conservative approach based on treatments with a minor alteration of the eye anatomy is preferred.

Comorbidities and Risk Factors

The presence of concomitant diseases increases with patients' age. In older patients with relevant comorbidities, the traditional surgical approach might be contraindicated or have a questionable risk–benefit ratio. In the latter case, the decision to perform surgery must be evaluated carefully, and other alternatives with a higher level of safety should be considered/preferred. As mentioned earlier, patients with mild-to-moderate glaucoma and cataract undergoing phacoemulsification and artificial lens implantation might have a limited benefit in time.

### Preoperative care for cataract surgery: the Society for Ambulatory Anesthesia position statement [^111XGKjp]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2021). Medium credibility.

Cataract surgeries are among the most common procedures requiring anesthesia care. Cataracts are a common cause of blindness. Surgery remains the only effective treatment of cataracts. Patients are often elderly with comorbidities. Most cataracts can be treated using topical or regional anesthesia with minimum or no sedation. There is minimal risk of adverse outcomes. There is general consensus that cataract surgery is extremely low risk, and the benefits of sight restoration and preservation are enormous. We present the Society for Ambulatory Anesthesia (SAMBA) position statement for preoperative care for cataract surgery.

MAC

Many cataract surgeries are performed under MAC, defined by The American Society of Anesthesiologists as "a specific anesthesia service performed by a qualified anesthesia provider for a diagnostic or therapeutic procedure. Indications include, but are not limited to, the nature of the procedure, the patient's clinical condition, or the need for deeper levels of analgesia and sedation than can be provided by moderate sedation (including potential conversion to a general or regional anesthetic)".

Unlike general anesthesia, MAC does not require intubation or ventilation and can be titrated according to patient and surgeon needs. Approximately one-third of outpatient procedures in the United States, whether diagnostic or therapeutic, use MAC. The most common medications that comprise MAC in the United States are shown in Table 1.

What Factors Should Be Considered When Selecting One MIGS Procedure Over Another?

All MIGS procedures share five common characteristics which include a high safety profile, negligible disruption of normal anatomy, an ab interno approach, efficacy in lowering IOP and/or reducing total medication, and ease of use. Common MIGS procedures often involve stent placement or goniotomy in order to bypass the trabecular meshwork and increase aqueous outflow. Trabecular meshwork bypass by stent placement is performed using devices such as the iStent (1st generation), iStent Inject, Istent Infinite and Hydrus Microstent all of which share the same indication for use in treating mild-to-moderate glaucoma during concurrent cataract removal. The iStent is easier to insert, but often times does not properly get into Schlemm's canal, potentially limiting its efficacy. The Hydrus is larger and slightly more challenging to place accurately into Schlemm's canal. Among MIGS procedures, the Hydrus has the longest follow-up study on its effectiveness over cataract surgery alone. The Hydrus has also been shown to be more effective than selective laser trabeculoplasty (SLT) in reducing medication use. Clear lens extraction and Hydrus has been shown to lower IOP, reduce medication use and preserve visual field in patients with open angle glaucoma. Trabecular meshwork bypass by tissue excision can be performed using the Kahook Dual Blade (KDB), Trabectome, Gonioscopy Assisted Transluminal Trabeculotomy (GATT), or TRAB 360. Goniotomy MIGS procedures have a greater range of indications than stent procedures. However, these procedures can increase the risk of hyphema. To reduce this risk, care should be taken to limit goniotomy to 4–5 hours and to have patients keep their heads elevated above the waist for 4 days after the procedure. They may be used in patients with OAG, angle closure glaucoma, or ocular hypertension, and can be performed during cataract surgery, or as a stand-alone procedure.VISCO360 ab interno canaloplasty can dilate the canal, but must be accompanied by goniotomy to be effective.

### Surgery for cataracts in people with age-related macular degeneration [^116LNnPw]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Cataract and age-related macular degeneration (AMD) are common causes of decreased vision that often occur simultaneously in people over age 50. Although cataract surgery is an effective treatment for cataract-induced visual loss, some clinicians suspect that such an intervention may increase the risk of worsening of underlying AMD and thus have deleterious effects on vision.

Objectives

The objective of this review was to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of cataract surgery compared with no surgery in eyes with AMD.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register) (2016, Issue 11), Ovid MEDLINE, Epub Ahead of Print, In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily (January 1946 to December 2016), Embase (January 1980 to December 2016), Latin American and Caribbean Literature on Health Sciences (LILACS) (January 1982 to December 2016), the ISRCTN registry (www.isrctn.com/editAdvancedSearch), ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov), and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 2 December 2016.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-randomized trials that enrolled participants whose eyes were affected by both cataract and AMD in which cataract surgery was compared with no surgery.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently evaluated the search results against the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Two review authors independently extracted data, assessed risk of bias for included studies, and graded the certainty of evidence. We followed methods as recommended by Cochrane.

Main Results

We included two RCTs with a total of 114 participants (114 study eyes) with visually significant cataract and AMD. We identified no ongoing trials. Participants in each RCT were randomized to immediate cataract surgery (within two weeks of enrollment) or delayed cataract surgery (six months after enrollment). The risk of bias was unclear for most domains in each study; one study was registered prospectively. In one study conducted in Australia outcomes were reported only at six months (before participants in the delayed-surgery group had cataract surgery). At six months, the immediate-surgery group showed mean improvement in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) compared with the delayed-surgery group (mean difference (MD) -0.15 LogMAR, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.28 to -0.02; 56 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). In the other study, conducted in Austria, outcomes were reported only at 12 months (12 months after participants in the immediate-surgery group and six months after participants in the delayed-surgery group had cataract surgery). There was uncertainty as to which treatment group had better improvement in distance visual acuity at 12 months (unit of measure not reported; very low-certainty evidence). At 12 months, the mean change from baseline between groups in cumulated drusen or geographic atrophy area size was small and there was uncertainty which, if either, of the groups was favored (MD 0.76, 95% CI -8.49 to 10.00; 49 participants; low-certainty evidence). No participant in one study had exudative AMD develop in the study eye during 12 months of follow-up; in the other study, choroidal neovascularization developed in the study eye of 1 of 27 participants in the immediate-surgery group versus 0 of 29 participants in the delayed-surgery group at six months (risk ratio 3.21, 95% CI 0.14 to 75.68; 56 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Quality of life was measured using two different questionnaires. Scores on the Impact of Vision Impairment (IVI) questionnaire suggested that the immediate-surgery group fared better regarding vision-related quality of life than the delayed-surgery group at six months (MD in IVI logit scores 1.60, 95% CI 0.61 to 2.59; low-certainty evidence). However, we could not analyze scores from the Visual Function-14 (VF-14) questionnaire from the other study due to insufficient data. No postoperative complication was reported from either study.

Authors' Conclusions

At this time, it is not possible to draw reliable conclusions from the available data as to whether cataract surgery is beneficial or harmful in people with AMD after 12 months. Although cataract surgery provides short-term (six months) improvement in BCVA in eyes with AMD compared with no surgery, it is unclear whether the timing of surgery has an effect on long-term outcomes. Physicians must make recommendations to their AMD patients regarding cataract surgery based on experience and clinical judgment until large controlled trials are conducted and their findings published. There is a need for prospective RCTs in which cataract surgery is compared with no surgery in people with AMD to better evaluate whether cataract surgery is beneficial or harmful in all or a subset of AMD patients. However, ethical considerations preclude withholding surgery, or delaying it for several years, if it may be a potentially beneficial treatment. Designers of future trials are encouraged to utilize existing standardized systems for grading cataract and AMD and for measuring key outcomes: visual acuity, change in visual acuity, worsening of AMD, quality of life measures, and adverse events.

### A proposed redesign of elective cataract services in scotland-pilot project [^114EKcJy]. Eye (2022). Medium credibility.

NICE guidelines recommend primary care health providers to counsel patients on cataract surgery when the referral is made. 97% of optometrists compared to 18% of GPs had a discussion regarding the risks and benefits of cataract surgery. This was reflected in the listing rates with 87% of optometrist referrals proceeding to surgery compared to 69% of GP referrals.

The inclusion of a focused medical and ophthalmic history and examination is fundamental to the cataract pre-assessment. Past medical history, a frequently overlooked item in optometrist referrals is important in the identification and optimisation of modifiable risk factors. Park et al. observed 68% optometry referrals included past medical history compared to 94% of GP referrals. Documentation of a drug history with particular regard to blood thinners and alpha blockers are important during surgical planning.

Pre-assessment allows the opportunity to screen for and identify systemic health conditions. Cataract operations performed under local anaesthetic do not undergo general health pre-assessment and medical co-morbidity can be overlooked. Prasad et al. demonstrated that a large proportion of their cancelled cataracts were as a result of uncontrolled hypertension. Knowledge of a patient's past medical history could be used to target at risk populations and optimise their general health prior to surgery.

Prasad et al. document that the pre-assessment visit is considered to be a valued opportunity for the patient to discuss the procedure and for the listing doctor to facilitate a patient centred approach. Nonetheless, in the current climate a face-to-face appointment may no longer be required, where an information leaflet or telephone call may suffice.

Combined cataract and endothelial transplant surgery — Cataract surgery in patients with coexistent endothelial dystrophy should be approached with careful patient consent and attention to which patients are most at risk of rapid progression; often the best strategy is to simply perform cataract surgery with proper consent regarding the possibility of subsequent corneal failure, and using dispersive OVD and minimizing ultrasound energy can delay or even eliminate the need for subsequent keratoplasty in some cases, although it is not clear if FLACS reduces the risk of subsequent endothelial failure; morning blurred vision may indicate endothelial pump impairment, and if lack of tear evaporation while sleeping leads to symptomatic corneal edema the likelihood of decompensation after cataract surgery is higher; in Fuchs dystrophy with morning decline in vision or epithelial or stromal edema on slit lamp examination, surgeons should consider concurrent endothelial transplant surgery; endothelial keratoplasty can create a hyperopic shift that can complicate combined surgery.

### Cataract in the adult eye preferred practice pattern [^111cYX5G]. Ophthalmology (2022). High credibility.

Outcomes — Multiple large studies of cataract surgery, including a review of the Cochrane Library, have repeatedly demonstrated favorable outcomes from cataract surgery (I+, Good, Strong). In a 2013 European Registry of Quality Outcomes for Cataract and Refractive Surgery analysis of 368,526 surgeries, 94.3% had 20/40 or better CDVA and 61.3% had 20/20 or better CDVA, with only 1.7% having worse CDVA postoperatively. IRIS registry data reported 81.7% of 33,437 eyes having CDVA of 20/40 or better by postoperative month 1, and a large multicenter United Kingdom study showed that over 95% of eyes with no ocular comorbidity had a CDVA of 20/40 or better. Predictors of greater improvement include younger age (under 65), less comorbidity, a higher cataract symptom score, and a worse VF-14 (visual function) score, while preoperative Snellen visual acuity was found to be unrelated to improvement; a prospectively validated model also identified younger age, poorer preoperative visual function by ADVS, and absence of diabetes. Even patients with diabetes and age-related macular degeneration (AMD) show substantial improvements after cataract surgery, there is no evidence that AMD accelerates, and improvement in quality of life for those 75 and older is functionally and statistically significant. In symptomatic cataract with preoperative Snellen acuity better than or equal to 20/50, even eyes with 20/20 or better preoperative acuity had improved self-reported visual impairment; neither preoperative best corrected high-contrast Snellen distance acuity nor change in Snellen acuity predicted improvement, and the strongest preoperative indicators were glare disability at low and medium spatial frequencies and the visual function questionnaire score; thus, Snellen visual acuity in isolation does not accurately predict who will benefit from surgery.

Methods

Study sample

Cataract surgery data were obtained through a data sharing agreement with the Health Quality Improvement Partnership who acted as the data controller for the National Ophthalmology Database cataract audit. Deidentified data were derived from 104 UK centres undertaking National Health Service (NHS) funded cataract surgery. Database analyses of this type which use deidentified data do not require ethical permission and are viewed as audit or service evaluation (see). This study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and the UK's Data Protection Act. Analyses were based on data on cataract operations undertaken between 1 April 2010 and 31 August 2018. Patients were eligible for analysis if they were aged 18 years or older and had a cataract operation using phacoemulsification (where the primary reason for the eye operation was cataract surgery for visual improvement), preoperative keratometry measurements, an intended refractive outcome and a postoperative refraction measurement. The presence of any comorbidity was noted at surgery by ticking the relevant boxes indicating the presence of a number of concurrent diagnoses where applicable. This was an essential item of the surgery proforma and the surgical record cannot be saved unless this part was completed.

Multilevel structure

The data had a two-way cross-classified multilevel structure. A surgeon operated on several patients and a patient either received a single cataract operation (to the left or right eye) or two cataract operations (one on each eye) predominantly on separate occasions. Among patients who received two operations, these were often conducted by different surgeons. Therefore, cataract operations for individual eyes were nested within cells of a two-way cross-classification of surgeons by patients.

### Surgery for cataracts in people with age-related macular degeneration [^1163LEwu]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Cataract and age-related macular degeneration (AMD) are significant causes of decreased vision in the elderly that often occur simultaneously. Although cataract surgery is an effective treatment for cataract-induced visual loss, some clinicians suspect that such an intervention may increase the risk of progression of underlying AMD and thus have deleterious effects on vision.

Objectives

The objective of this review was to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of cataract surgery in eyes with AMD.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group Trials Register) (The Cochrane Library, Issue 4, 2008), MEDLINE (January 1966 to November 2008), EMBASE (January 1980 to November 2008) and Latin American and Caribbean Literature on Health Sciences (LILACS) (January 1982 to November 2008). There were no language or date restrictions in the search for trials. The electronic databases were last searched on 4 November 2008.

Selection Criteria

We planned to include randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-randomized trials of eyes affected by both cataract and AMD in which cataract surgery would be compared to no surgery.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently evaluated the search results against the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Discrepancies were resolved by discussion.

Main Results

We found no RCTs, thus no analysis was conducted. Evidence was limited to non-randomized clinical trials and prospective cohort and case-control studies.

Authors' Conclusions

At this time, it is not possible to draw reliable conclusions from the available data to determine whether cataract surgery is beneficial or harmful in people with AMD. Physicians will have to make practice decisions based on best clinical judgement until controlled trials are conducted and their findings published.

### Cataract surgery: factors influencing decision to treat and implications for training (south-east scotland 2008–2014) [^115Q4CDo]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

Some studies show that optometric cataract referrals provide better information on objectively measured vision and better delivery of patient preoperative counselling, whereas traditional GP referrals contain better medical history, drug information, and details of personal circumstances. There is no single test to assess the effect of cataracts on a patient nor is there a test to decide on threshold for surgery. This results in a wide range in the type of patient referred for cataract surgery, from those with very minimal disability to those with severe visual impairment.

Moreover, the literature shows that visual impairment is very often associated with multiple physical and mental health co-morbidities that need to be taken into account by both patient and surgeon when a patient is being considered for cataract surgery. It has also been suggested that the significant variation in cataract surgery rates across the UK is caused by differences in cataract referral patterns.

### Cataract in the adult eye preferred practice pattern [^1118HChv]. Ophthalmology (2022). High credibility.

Adult cataract — ophthalmic evaluation states that a comprehensive ophthalmic evaluation, or history and physical examination, includes those components of the comprehensive adult medical eye evaluation specially relevant to the diagnosis and treatment of a cataract as listed below. Components include patient history, including an assessment of functional status, pertinent medical conditions, medications currently used, and other risk factors that can affect the surgical plan or outcome of surgery (e.g., immunosuppressive conditions, use of systemic alpha-1 antagonists, diabetes); visual acuity with correction (the power of the present correction recorded) at distance and, when appropriate, at near; refraction and measurement of corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA) in both eyes; glare testing when indicated; assessment of pupil size and function; visual field assessment; examination of ocular alignment and motility; external examination (eyelids, lashes, lacrimal apparatus, orbit); measurement of IOP; slit-lamp biomicroscopy of the cornea, anterior chamber, iris, lens, vitreous, macula, peripheral retina, and optic nerve through a dilated pupil; and indirect ophthalmoscopy.

Most cataracts are related to aging. By age 80, more than half of all Americans either have a cataract or have experienced cataract surgery. Although this editorial does not have any direct relationship to cardiovascular medicine, it may have some applicability with your patients, many of whom may be older rather than younger, and have cardiovascular disease in addition to visual problems perhaps due to cataracts.

### Cataract surgery in the context of age-related macular degeneration: challenges and considerations [^1179ZKFV]. Journal of Cataract and Refractive Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and cataracts commonly coexist in the aging population, posing unique diagnostic and therapeutic challenges for ophthalmologists. While cataract surgery can substantially improve visual function, outcomes are often influenced by the type and severity of underlying macular pathology. This narrative review explores current evidence on the impact of cataract surgery in AMD patients, including preoperative assessment strategies, intraoperative considerations, and postoperative visual expectations. The role of multimodal imaging in detecting subclinical macular changes, advanced intraocular lenses, and the debated relationship between cataract surgery and AMD progression are discussed. Emphasis is placed on personalized patient selection and counseling to optimize outcomes. Overall, with appropriate planning and patient-centered care, cataract surgery remains a safe and beneficial intervention for most individuals with AMD.

### The changing pattern of cataract surgery indications: a 5-year study of 2 cataract surgery databases [^115RJrEk]. Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

The aim of this study was to describe changes over time in the indications and outcomes of cataract surgery and to discuss optimal timing for the surgery.

Design

Database study.

Participants

Patients who had undergone cataract extraction in the Netherlands, Sweden, or Malaysia from 2008 through 2012.

Methods

We analyzed preoperative, surgical, and postoperative data from 2 databases: the European Registry of Quality Outcomes for Cataract and Refractive Surgery (EUREQUO) and the Malaysian National Cataract Registry. The EUREQUO contains complete data from the national cataract registries in the Netherlands and Sweden.

Main Outcome Measures

Preoperative and postoperative corrected distance visual acuity, preoperative ocular comorbidity in the surgery eye, and capsule complications during surgery.

Results

There were substantial differences in indication for surgery between the 3 national data sets. The percentage of eyes with a preoperative best-corrected visual acuity of 20/200 or worse varied from 7.1% to 72%. In all 3 data sets, the visual thresholds for cataract surgery decreased over time by 6% to 28% of the baseline values. The frequency of capsule complications varied between the 3 data sets, from 1.1% to 3.7% in 2008 and from 0.6% to 2.7% in 2012. An increasing postoperative visual acuity was also seen for all 3 data sets. A high frequency of capsule complication was related significantly to poor preoperative visual acuity, and a high frequency of decreased visual acuity after surgery was related significantly to excellent preoperative visual acuity.

Conclusions

The 5-year trend in all 3 national data sets showed decreasing visual thresholds for surgery, decreasing surgical complication rates, and increasing visual outcomes regardless of the initial preoperative visual level. Cataract surgery on eyes with poor preoperative visual acuity was related to surgical complications, and cataract surgery on eyes with excellent preoperative visual acuity was related to adverse visual results.

### Changing patterns in cataract surgery indications, outcomes, and costs, 2012–2023: a retrospective study at aravind eye hospitals, India [^111DXu5g]. The Lancet Regional Health: Southeast Asia (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

In 2020, South Asia had the highest number of vision impaired individuals among twenty-one global regions: 11.9 M with blindness, 96.2 M with moderate or severe vision impairment (VI), and 60.1 M with mild VI. Among adults aged 50 and older, South Asia experienced the largest percentage reductions in age-standardized prevalence of blindness and moderate to severe VI from 1990–2020. Cataracts and refractive error are the leading causes of vision impairment globally and in this region. Given the magnitude and changing nature of VI in this region, understanding long-term trends in the incidence, prevalence, and treatment of cataracts is crucial.

Data on the evolving characteristics of patients seeking cataract surgery, the mix of surgical techniques, preoperative vision, postoperative visual outcomes, and costs, are critical for understanding both changing community preferences and progress towards global eye care targets. For instance, recent guidelines by the World Health Organization (WHO) have defined the population in need of cataract surgery as individuals with Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) < 6/12 with cataract as the main cause of VI; this is a lower threshold than currently followed, and the first time such a definitive threshold has been recommended. High income countries such as Australia, Denmark, England, the Netherlands, Sweden, and the United States, have reported a trend of improving preoperative vision; that is, the community is seeking care earlier. Since better visual acuity thresholds for cataract surgery are often accompanied with increasing Cataract Surgical Rates, (CSR: the annual number of cataract surgeries per million population) such trends have key implications for the management of demand and supply of surgery, particularly in resource constrained settings. However, most low and middle income countries (LMICs) around the world, including the five countries in South Asia–Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal, and Pakistan — lack administrative databases or population-based studies that report trends in such key measures at the national, sub-national, or regional level.

### Small-incision phacotrabeculectomy versus phacoemulsification in refractory acute primary angle closure with cataract [^115FBPdM]. BMC Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

Merits of small-incision phacotrabeculectomy for refractive acute PAC with cataract include: less postoperative inflammatory reaction as phaco, better IOP control in the long term, less possibility of IOP lowing medication and progression to glaucoma. In addition, combined phacotrabeculectomy may help elderly patients with less psychological and financial burden. Any operative option should base on the specific condition of ocular diseases and the premise of no violation of evidence-based medicine, taking the most advantageous way for patients. In patients with medically uncontrolled glaucoma and cataract, the options are to perform trabeculectomy first then phacoemulsification, phacoemulsification first and then trabeculectomy, or phacotrabeculectomy. The surgical indications of combined phacotrabeculectomy should be reserved for any one of the following conditions: refractory to drug or laser treatment with high IOP, attack history or moderate to severe optic nerve damage, tendency to malignant glaucoma, requirement of vision improvement, no chance to have 2 separate surgeries due to ocular or systemic conditions, and poor adherence or inconvenience of follow-up, etc. Small-incision phacotrabeculectomy may offer clinical and technical advantages over the standard combined operations where conventional treatment fails.

This study may not have sufficient follow-up duration and sample size to look at other parameters, such as additional IOP lowing medication and glaucomatous progression. Multicenter randomized controlled clinical trials are required to confirm these observations.

### Cataract surgery: factors influencing decision to treat and implications for training (south-east scotland 2008–2014) [^115frVEJ]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

In our study CI and previous CVA were the only medical conditions that showed a significant difference in the group that did not go ahead with cataract surgery. Guidelines state that a stable period of 3 months is required before cataract surgery in case of recent myocardial infarction and this rule is often applied by many clinicians in situations of a recent CVA. Some studies have shown, that cataract surgery and subsequent improved vision can have a positive role in patients with CI. Cognitive testing is not routinely applied within the NHS in preoperative assessment. However, increasingly with an ageing population and more patients who present for cataract surgery, services may have to be planned in the future to take into account CI and how decisions are made for and with these patients. Interestingly over 45% of patients in both groups had systemic hypertension, but the difference between group B and C was not significant. Guidelines state that in case of poorly controlled blood pressure, cataract surgery should be deferred. Nonetheless, our findings suggest that this condition most likely did not affect the decision about cataract surgery.

There was a higher number of ocular co-morbidities amongst the patients who did not have cataract surgery (Table 1). However, only age-related macular degeneration and other macular pathology (with exclusion of diabetic maculopathy), corneal pathology and amblyopia contributed to this statistically significant difference. These findings are similar to that found in the cataract national audit, where the above features were found to be adverse preoperative risk factors for good visual outcome. The most recent audit on modern cataract surgery was performed at an Australian urban teaching hospital and included data from 3,740 eyes in years 2006–2013. The results of preoperative ocular co-pathology are comparable to our study with about 70% patients not having any ocular pathology. Age-related macular degeneration (8.4%) and glaucoma (8.56%) are the highest recorded eye conditions. Some studies have shown possible association between having cataract surgery and increased risk of age-related macular degeneration progression. This perhaps goes someway in explaining why these patients did not have surgery.

### Preoperative testing before noncardiac surgery: guidelines and recommendations [^111ydUcR]. American Family Physician (2013). Low credibility.

Preoperative testing (e.g., chest radiography, electrocardiography, laboratory testing, urinalysis) is often performed before surgical procedures. These investigations can be helpful to stratify risk, direct anesthetic choices, and guide postoperative management, but often are obtained because of protocol rather than medical necessity. The decision to order preoperative tests should be guided by the patient's clinical history, comorbidities, and physical examination findings. Patients with signs or symptoms of active cardiovascular disease should be evaluated with appropriate testing, regardless of their preoperative status. Electrocardiography is recommended for patients undergoing high-risk surgery and those undergoing intermediate-risk surgery who have additional risk factors. Patients undergoing low-risk surgery do not require electrocardiography. Chest radiography is reasonable for patients at risk of postoperative pulmonary complications if the results would change perioperative management. Preoperative urinalysis is recommended for patients undergoing invasive urologic procedures and those undergoing implantation of foreign material. Electrolyte and creatinine testing should be performed in patients with underlying chronic disease and those taking medications that predispose them to electrolyte abnormalities or renal failure. Random glucose testing should be performed in patients at high risk of undiagnosed diabetes mellitus. In patients with diagnosed diabetes, A1C testing is recommended only if the result would change perioperative management. A complete blood count is indicated for patients with diseases that increase the risk of anemia or patients in whom significant perioperative blood loss is anticipated. Coagulation studies are reserved for patients with a history of bleeding or medical conditions that predispose them to bleeding, and for those taking anticoagulants. Patients in their usual state of health who are undergoing cataract surgery do not require preoperative testing.

### Combined cataract extraction and baerveldt glaucoma drainage implant: indications and outcomes [^116HKhHb]. Ophthalmology (2002). Low credibility.

Purpose

To report the indications and outcomes of simultaneous cataract extraction (CE) and Baerveldt glaucoma drainage implant surgery.

Design

Noncomparative, interventional, retrospective, consecutive case series.

Participants

Thirty-three eyes of 33 patients.

Intervention

Combined phacoemulsification CE and Baerveldt glaucoma drainage implant (BGI) surgery at two tertiary care referral centers.

Main Outcome Measures

Visual acuity, intraocular pressure (IOP), and complications.

Results

The study included 33 eyes of 33 patients followed for an average of 15.4 months (range, 3.0–46.9). The most common indication for combined CE and Baerveldt glaucoma drainage implant surgery was a history of prior failed trabeculectomy. Postoperative visual acuity at last follow-up was ≥ 20/40 in 12 of 33 patients (36%). IOP was reduced from a mean (± standard deviation) of 21 ± 7.3 mmHg preoperatively to 13.1 ± 3.5 mmHg at last follow-up visit (P < 0.001). The number of antiglaucoma medications was reduced from a mean (± standard deviation) of 2.3 ± 1.0 preoperatively to 0.7 ± 1.1 at last follow-up (P < 0.001). Three eyes met our criteria for failure, and cumulative survival of the glaucoma surgery at 18 months was 89%. Intraoperative complications were all related to the cataract surgery, whereas early and late postoperative complications were related both to the CE and BGI surgery.

Conclusions

Combined CE and Baerveldt glaucoma drainage implant placement seems to be a safe and effective surgical option and may be preferred in certain clinical situations.

### Safety and efficacy of twice daily administration of KPI-121 1% for ocular inflammation and pain following cataract surgery [^113Pc5Ej]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2019). Medium credibility.

Materials and methods

Patients

These trials included two samples of patients who underwent routine, uncomplicated cataract surgery (eg, phacoemulsification with posterior chamber intraocular lens implantation, not combined with any other surgery), had ≥ grade 2 anterior chamber cells (ie, ≥ 6 cells), and had potential postoperative Snellen distance visual acuity (VA) by pinhole method of at least 20/200 in the study eye. The first trial (hereafter referred to as Trial 1) was conducted at 24 sites (Table S1) within the US between May 2014 and December 2014 and the second trial (hereafter referred to as Trial 2) was conducted at 35 sites (Table S2) within the US between June 2016 and March 2017. Each trial was designed and monitored in accordance with the ethical principles of Good Clinical Practice and the Declaration of Helsinki, and Institutional Review Board approval was obtained by each trial site. Written informed consent was obtained from all subjects at the time of their enrollment and prior to any screening evaluations for the trial.

Individuals of either sex or any race/ethnicity who were ≥ 18 years and were candidates for routine, uncomplicated cataract surgery were eligible for participation in the trials. Patients who required concurrent ocular or non-ocular therapy with any type of medication (eg, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, mast cell stabilizers, antihistamines, or decongestants) within 2 days prior to surgery and for the duration of the study were excluded from the trial as were patients with a history of glaucoma, intraocular pressure (IOP) > 21 mmHg at the screening or randomization visit(s), or were being treated for glaucoma in either eye. Also excluded were patients who: 1) had penetrating intraocular surgery in the study eye within 3 months or within 2 weeks in the fellow eye; 2) had selective laser trabeculoplasty within 3 months prior to surgery or had corneal refractive surgery, glaucoma surgery, or corneal transplantation (full thickness, anterior, or posterior) within a year prior to enrollment or were unstable and/or required medication; 3) had active uveitis in either eye or a diagnosis of any type of infection, disease, and/or severe/serious condition that would interfere with study drug effectiveness or study compliance.

### A self-administered health questionnaire for the preoperative risk stratification of patients undergoing cataract surgery [^111tATJu]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose

To determine if a self-administered health status questionnaire completed by candidates for cataract surgery is beneficial for identifying medical comorbidities and patients at risk for adverse intraoperative and postoperative medical events.

Design

Prospective cohort study.

Methods

Data were obtained from a large, randomized clinical trial of 19,250 cataract surgeries performed between June 1, 1995, and June 30, 1997. Preoperative data were obtained from a standardized, self-administered patient health questionnaire and a history and physical form completed by the patient's physician. A record of adverse medical events on the day of surgery and through the first 7 postoperative days was recorded.

Results

Responses to 21 questions on the questionnaire were highly specific for 12 comorbid conditions identified by the physician history and physical, ranging from 100% specificity for arrhythmia to 91.3% specificity for coronary artery disease. Comorbid conditions identified by the questionnaire were associated with similar relative risks of adverse events as those identified by the physician history and physical. Patients who had no comorbidities identified by the questionnaire had adverse medical event rates indistinguishable from patients with no comorbid conditions identified by the health provider history and physical.

Conclusions

The self-administered questionnaire showed a high degree of specificity for 12 common comorbid conditions in cataract patients. A questionnaire such as this may be useful in preoperative risk stratification.

### Does standalone phacoemulsification lower intraocular pressure in glaucomatous eyes? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^112xn2wP]. Eye (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Glaucoma is a leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide, characterized by progressive optic nerve damage often associated with elevated intraocular pressure (IOP). Over the past two decades, the prevalence of primary open-angle glaucoma (OAG) in adults has reached 2.4%, affecting ~69 million patients. Although elevated IOP is not the sole cause of glaucoma, it remains the only modifiable risk factor, making it the primary target for interventions.

Various surgical approaches are available for glaucoma management, with trabeculectomy and glaucoma drainage implants being among the most common. The choice of surgery depends on factors such as the type of glaucoma, the patient's overall health, and associated risk factors. While these surgical techniques effectively reduce IOP and control disease progression, suboptimal outcomes can still occur due to complications. Such complications include scarring and fibrosis of the filtering bleb established during trabeculectomy, as well as hypotony and tube shunt occlusion associated with glaucoma drainage devices. Furthermore, a recent multicentre randomized controlled trial (RCT) reported five-year cumulative failure rates of 42% for tube shunts and 35% for trabeculectomy.

Coexisting glaucoma and cataract are common in older individuals, particularly those over the age of 60. Given the frequent concurrence of these conditions, cataract surgery presents a unique opportunity to assess its effect on IOP changes and glaucoma progression. Several publications, including RCTs, have described the effects of cataract surgery on IOP in both glaucomatous and non-glaucomatous eyes. While the extent of IOP reduction varies, the majority of studies have reported a postoperative decrease in IOP following cataract extraction. Additionally, a significant proportion of patients experience a reduction in the need for postoperative glaucoma medications. These findings indicate that cataract surgery not only lowers IOP in unmedicated patients but also reduces dependence on glaucoma medications.

Our study aimed to evaluate the reliability of phacoemulsification in reducing both IOP and the need for glaucoma medications in glaucoma patients through a systematic review and meta-analysis. We analyzed the effects of phacoemulsification alone based on both absolute IOP changes and the percentage of IOP reduction (IOPR%) at 12- and 24-month follow-ups, focusing exclusively on RCTs to uphold the highest standard of evidence-based research.

### Cataract in the adult eye preferred practice pattern [^113kTmT3]. Ophthalmology (2022). High credibility.

Adult cataract — supplemental ophthalmic testing notes that supplemental preoperative ophthalmic tests are not specific for a cataract but may help to identify both the cause and level of severity of an individual's visual symptoms as well as the extent to which comorbidities may be contributing to these symptoms, and that for most patients an ophthalmologist can determine whether a cataract is responsible for an individual patient's visual loss by comparing slit-lamp biomicroscopy findings with the patient's specific symptoms; occasionally, a patient presents with visual symptoms that are disproportionate to the degree of cataract formation, and visual acuity testing alone does not quantify certain visual symptoms, such as disability due to glare and reduced contrast sensitivity. Optical testing indicates that glare testing determines the degree of visual impairment in the presence of light scatter, cataracts may produce a severe visual disability in brightly lit scenarios, the visual acuity of some patients with cataract may be normal or near normal in a darkened examination room but may drop significantly in the presence of glare, significant reduction in visual acuity with glare testing is by no means specific for cataract, correlation with slit-lamp biomicroscopy findings is required to establish cataract as the etiology, and stray light (or light scatter) can be measured and may be used for the evaluation of glare and indication for cataract surgery; contrast sensitivity testing measures the patient's ability to detect subtle variations in shading and is a more comprehensive and time-consuming measure of visual function than Snellen testing, may demonstrate a loss of visual function that is not appreciated by Snellen testing alone, and is not a specific indicator of cataract.

### Cataract surgery: factors influencing decision to treat and implications for training (south-east scotland 2008–2014) [^1156mYaj]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Cataract is an important cause of visual impairment world-wide and cataract surgery is the commonest elective surgical intervention in the UK and developed world. It is predicted that a quarter of the population of the UK will develop cataracts by the age of 75 years. In Scotland, 33,064 cataract extractions were performed in the year 2010/2011 compared to 20,578 in the year 2001/2002 with an increasing trend year upon year, despite a stable population. As at June 2013, 4,088 people were on the waiting list for outpatient assessment for cataract surgery in National Health Service (NHS), Scotland. This number has nearly doubled over the previous year since June 2012 when only 2,403 people were reported to be waiting for cataract assessment.–

These numbers reflect the tremendous increased demand for cataract surgery, the causes of which are multifactorial and include an ageing population, better access to treatment, faster surgical technique and rehabilitation, increased education, and public awareness of the benefits of cataract surgery. This has reached a point where the possibility of over-provision of cataract surgery in some regions has been described in the literature.

Currently, there are no specific thresholds or criteria that define appropriate patients for referral and/or cataract surgery. Referral methods and pathways to surgery vary greatly throughout the UK depending on locally agreed protocols. The most up-to-date Royal College of Ophthalmologists Cataract Surgery Guidelines from September 2010 give no specific visual acuity threshold for surgery. However, the guidelines highlight the importance of cataract impact on patient lifestyle, balancing the risks and benefits of surgery when taking a decision to perform the operation. Other factors to consider are patients' ocular and non-ocular co-morbidities, as well as the effect of first and second eye cataract surgery. Some effort has been made to produce questionnaires evaluating the impact of cataract on quality of life issues. However they often lack applicability to certain patient groups and have not found routine use in the NHS.

### Cataracts: a review [^112S4eAv]. JAMA (2025). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Age-related cataract, defined as progressive opacification or clouding of the eye's natural lens, is a leading cause of visual disability and blindness. Cataract surgery is one of the most commonly performed procedures in high-income countries. More than 3.5 million cataract operations are performed annually in the US.

Observations

Older age is the primary risk factor for cataracts, with approximately two-thirds of the population older than 80 years affected. As the population ages, the number of people with cataracts in the US is expected to increase to 50 million by 2050. Additional risk factors for cataracts include a hereditary or genetic predisposition, certain medications (corticosteroids), ocular trauma, significant UV exposure or radiation therapy, and certain medical conditions such as uncontrolled diabetes, retinitis pigmentosa, Down syndrome, and congenital rubella. Painless, progressive blurring of vision and visual glare are common symptoms of cataracts. Cataracts are diagnosed during an eye examination by an ophthalmologist or optometrist. Surgery to remove the cataract and implant a permanent intraocular lens (IOL) is indicated if visual impairment impedes activities of daily living and is associated with lower rates of falls (> 30%) and dementia (20%-30%). Most cataract operations are performed with topical anesthesia. Therefore, patients do not require preoperative general medical testing such as bloodwork or electrocardiogram, and do not need to discontinue anticoagulants for cataract surgery. Systemic α1-adrenergic antagonists for symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia, such as tamsulosin, increase the risk of surgical complications and some ophthalmologists temporarily discontinue the drug preoperatively. Intraocular antibiotics, such as moxifloxacin or cefuroxime, delivered intraoperatively have reduced the rates of sight-threatening postsurgical endophthalmitis from 0.07% to 0.02%. In addition to reversing and preventing progressive vision loss, cataract surgery can reduce dependence on eyeglasses. These optional refractive benefits are achieved with advanced technology IOL designs, such as multifocal IOLs. However, multifocal and other advanced technology refractive IOLs are associated with increased costs that are not covered by medical insurance.

Conclusions and Relevance

Cataracts are common among older adults and may cause visual disability and blindness without treatment. Cataract surgery reverses and prevents progressive vision loss, and advanced technology lens implants facilitate reduced dependence on eyeglasses.

### Refractive outcomes after trabecular micro-bypass stents (iStent) with cataract extraction in open-angle glaucoma [^112XRCye]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Simultaneous cataract and glaucoma surgery represents a potential challenge for the anterior segment surgeon. An option to reduce the surgical, anaesthetic and recovery load, however, must be weighed against an elevated risk of intraoperative complications and sub-optimal refractive outcomes in patients with concomitant ocular disease.–With recent developments in intraocular lens (IOL) and biometry technology, stand-alone cataract surgery now provides a substantial opportunity to increase optical independence and vision-related quality of life. Given this, patient expectations have similarly increased. Despite often long-term ophthalmic care, glaucoma patients would appear to hold similar expectations of an improved range of vision following cataract surgery.

Trabeculectomy has long been considered the gold standard for glaucoma patients where medical and laser treatments have been unable to control intraocular pressure (IOP). Although trabeculectomy and other invasive glaucoma surgical approaches provide a proven track record in reducing and maintaining IOP, successful visual rehabilitation may be compromised by surgically induced anatomical changes leading to residual defocus and astigmatic errors.–Alternative IOP-lowering procedures have become commonplace for glaucoma, and increasingly anterior segment surgeons. Minimally invasive glaucoma surgery (MIGS) techniques and similar non-penetrating options now represent the first surgical procedure of choice for patients with mild- to- moderate glaucoma requiring additional treatment. With minimal or no additional need for conjunctival suturing or the application of anti-metabolite treatment, it would be expected that routine MIGS surgery should have a nominal impact on refractive outcomes. A number of studies have highlighted the safety and effectiveness of MIGS procedures in reducing IOP however few have indicated the refractive outcomes, particularly astigmatic effects. We present a refractive cohort of patients undergoing simultaneous glaucoma and cataract procedures and discuss the potential implications of cataract surgery and IOL implantation in patients with co-existent glaucoma.

### Cataract in the adult eye preferred practice pattern [^112fZ9ki]. Ophthalmology (2022). High credibility.

Cataract in the adult eye — preoperative evaluation and counseling (examination, documentation, consent, and refractive counseling): The ophthalmologist who will perform cataract surgery should do the following, including examine the patient preoperatively; ensure that the documented evaluation accurately reflects the symptoms, findings, and indications for treatment; obtain informed consent from the patient or surrogate after discussing the risks, benefits, and expected outcomes of surgery, including the patient's expected surgical experience and the anticipated refractive outcome; review the results of the presurgical evaluation with the patient or surrogate; and counsel about postoperative refractive options such as bilateral emmetropia, bilateral myopia, or monovision and about elective refractive options including astigmatism management, intraoperative refractive guidance, and specialty intraocular lenses (IOLs) (toric, extended depth of focus, multifocal, accommodating, and postoperative power adjustable), with consideration of postoperative refractive enhancement.

### Is cataract surgery justified in patients with age related macular degeneration? A visual function and quality of life assessment [^111juty9]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2000). Low credibility.

Aims

To determine whether patients with age related macular degeneration (ARMD) benefit from cataract surgery in terms of visual function and quality of life measures, and to assess the impact of surgery on the progression of ARMD.

Methods

A prospective study was carried out of patients with and without ARMD undergoing cataract surgery. Data were collected from 187 patients at the Princess Alexandra Eye Pavilion, Edinburgh and the Oxford Eye Hospital, Oxford. The patients were divided into three groups: (1) a control group with ARMD and no surgery (n = 41), (2) a study group of patients with ARMD who underwent cataract surgery (n = 90), and (3) a second control group of patients without ocular comorbidities who underwent cataract surgery (n = 56). Visual function and quality of life assessments were carried out at baseline and 3–5 months after baseline or surgery.

Results

There were significant improvements both in terms of quality of life and visual function measures in the study group. Benefits were greater in patients with moderate cataract irrespective of the degree of ARMD. No increased incidence in progression to the "wet" form of ARMD was found. Improvements in quality of life measures and visual function were more pronounced in patients with no ocular comorbidities.

Conclusions

Patients with mild and moderate degrees of ARMD do benefit from cataract surgery and the benefits are greater in patients with moderate degrees of lens opacity. Longer follow up is required to assess the risk of increased ARMD progression.

### Advanced age does not predispose to intraoperative complications among high-risk cataract surgeries [^112iixDQ]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Cataract surgery in patients aged 80 years and above was not associated with increased intraoperative complications or worse short-term visual outcomes compared to younger patients. Age alone should not be considered a limiting factor; instead, surgical decisions should be based on individual risk profiles. With appropriate care, elderly patients can achieve meaningful surgical results.

Cataract surgery and uveitis — risk considerations and coordination: Patients with active inflammation, particularly those with anterior or intermediate uveitis, are at substantial risk for complications; in those with pre-existing iris damage or extensive posterior synechiae, a major potential problem is the development of adhesions between the iris and lens capsule postoperatively, and other potential problems include membrane formation, IOL deposits, zonular problems, and cystoid macular edema (CME). Coordination with the physicians treating the patient's uveitis and any systemic autoimmune disease prior to cataract surgery will provide appropriate prophylactic anti-inflammatory therapy and improve postsurgical outcomes.

Uveitis — associated issues and timing of cataract surgery: Common associated problems include posterior synechiae, weakened zonular fibers, protein and cellular deposits on the lens implant, cystoid macular edema (CME), secondary glaucoma, and prolonged postoperative inflammation. Inflammation should be inactive or at its best level of control possible, generally for 3 or more months prior to elective surgery; topical and/or periocular, intraocular, and systemic anti‑inflammatory medications should be started prior to surgery and then used more frequently and for a longer duration following surgery, and intravitreal, periocular, or systemic administration may also be considered.

### Indications and outcomes of intraocular lens exchange among pseudophakic eyes in a tertiary referral center [^111WTnZz]. BMC Ophthalmology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cataract disease is the second cause of visual impairment worldwide. Cataract surgery is the most common intraocular surgical procedure promoting the quality of life and vision. Primary and secondary implantation of intraocular lenses (IOLs) in cataract surgery affect the postoperative outcomes.

Although this type of intraocular surgery is safe and primarily performed without any severe complications, the second operation may be necessary for some patients to remove or exchange the IOL. Bothun et al. demonstrated the increasing rate of IOL exchange in pseudophakic patients over the last 30 years in a population-based study.

Various causes are reported as indications of IOL exchange regarding the IOL design and its biomaterial. In a review article conducted by Fernández-Buenaga et al. IOL decentration, inaccurate IOL power calculation, and IOL opacification were reported as the three most common indications for IOL explanation. Regarding the type of IOL, Marques et al. found that intraocular inflammation and IOL decentration were the primary indications in eyes implanted by anterior and posterior chamber IOLs, respectively. Furthermore, refractory cystoid macular edema, pseudophakic bullous keratopathy, and patient dissatisfaction have been reported as the other indications in various studies. Intraoperative complications and preoperative ocular comorbidity are also associated with causes of IOL exchange.

Recently, clinical outcomes of the IOL exchange are also evolving. Therefore, optimal visual results with fewer complications are expected after the IOL exchange. Recognition of the factors leading to IOL exchange and the final clinical outcomes after the procedure helps more accurate decision-making in similar conditions. The present study was designed to determine the indications and clinical outcomes of IOL exchange in pseudophakic patients operated on in a Tertiary Referral Center.

### Preventing blindness with early cataract surgery and micro-invasive glaucoma surgery in patients over 50: guidance for patients, physicians and world governments in dealing with glaucoma [^114bKENj]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Glaucoma is a leading cause of blindness worldwide, and its diagnosis and management are crucial for preventing vision loss. Elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) is a significant risk factor for glaucoma progression, and reducing IOP is the primary goal of treatment. Pharmacotherapy is typically the first-line therapy for glaucoma management; however, it has limitations including noncompliance and undesirable adverse effects. Laser and surgical treatments may provide long-term IOP reduction, but have procedural risks and treatment failure. Traditional incisional procedures have begun to be replaced by minimally invasive glaucoma surgeries (MIGS) with improved safety profiles and minimal decreases in efficacy.

Several MIGS procedures have been developed to reduce IOP by targeting different outflow pathways. These include trabecular meshwork bypass procedures (iStent), suprachoroidal shunts (Cypass microstent), canaloplasty, gonioscopy-assisted transluminal trabeculotomy (GATT), among others.MIGS procedures offer advantages such as reduced complications compared to traditional surgeries; however, there is emerging evidence on their long-term efficacy compared to traditional surgeries or medical therapy. The development of new devices and techniques for MIGS has provided options for more individualized surgical approaches.MIGS have transformed the surgical management of glaucoma, a less invasive alternative with improved safety profiles compared to traditional surgeries.

MIGS are indicated for treatment in patients with progressive primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) that has failed to be managed by topical medication and/or laser trabeculoplasty. MIGS serve as a less invasive alternative to traditional glaucoma surgeries. In the United States specifically, many trabecular meshwork MIGS are indicated for use in the reduction of IOP in adult patients with mild-to-moderate POAG only when performed in conjunction with cataract surgery (Figure 1).

Figure 1
Surgical Management for Adults over the Age of 50 with Elevated Intraocular Pressure.

Cataract and microinvasive glaucoma surgery has gained a tremendous amount of popularity in treating glaucoma patients earlier and with safer surgery. This is transforming the landscape of how physicians treat glaucoma. Several questions have arisen from patients, physicians, and governments about this new approach to glaucoma treatment. Within this narrative review, we attempt to address these concerns.

### Comparison of surgical outcomes between excisional goniotomy using the kahook dual blade and iStent trabecular micro-bypass stent in combination with phacoemulsification [^114eGUcK]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

For patients with co-existing glaucoma and cataract, the recent development of micro-invasive glaucoma surgeries (MIGS) has significantly expanded the range of options available for surgical co-management of these two common age-related conditions. Collectively the MIGS procedures offer improved safety over traditional filtering surgeries, albeit with reduced efficacy. Individually, these procedures differ in many ways, from indications to safety to route of aqueous humor outflow. These differences inform the process of selecting the appropriate procedure based on the characteristics and surgical goals of individual patients.

The iStent trabecular micro-bypass (Glaukos, San Clemente, CA) shunts aqueous humour across the trabecular meshwork (TM) into Schlemm's canal. The device's label specifies that the procedure is combined with cataract surgery in eyes with mild to moderate open-angle glaucoma (OAG). In its pivotal trial, iStent-Phaco lowered IOP by approximately 8.1% from medicated baseline and reduced medication use by 87% at 12 months, suggesting its optimal role is for medication reduction, although even the medication reductions were insignificantly different from those seen in eyes undergoing phaco alone at 24 months.

The Kahook Dual Blade (New World Medical, Rancho Cucamonga, CA) is a surgical knife designed to excise a strip of TM in a procedure known as excisional goniotomy. The procedure can be performed at the time of cataract surgery or as a standalone procedure, is effective in mild to advanced OAG,–and has been performed successfully in secondary glaucomas as well.–In clinical studies, KDB-Phaco lowered IOP by ~25% and medications by ~45–65%. As a stand-alone procedure, KDB was showed to lower IOP by 40% and medications by 36%.

In this analysis, we compare our outcomes with iStent and KDB in a sample of eyes representing the overlap in these procedures' indications — in mild to moderate open-angle glaucoma at the time of cataract surgery.

For Goniotomy

For What Types of Glaucoma Should Goniotomy Be Offered as a Therapy? Is Ocular HTN an Acceptable Indication for Either Stents or Goniotomy?

MIGS goniotomy techniques such as the KDB, trabectome, GATT, TRAB 360, Sinskey hook goniotomy, and straight bent cystotomemay be used for a wider spectrum of disease than stand-alone stent placement. Studies have demonstrated efficacy in performing micro-invasive goniotomy for the treatment of refractory glaucoma, primary and secondary OAG, angle-closure glaucoma, pseudoexfoliation glaucoma, pigmentary glaucoma, and ocular hypertension. The most identifiable cause of ocular hypertension is age-related enlargement of the lens. In patients over 50 with ocular hypertension, many will benefit from earlier cataract surgery/refractive lensectomy and goniotomy to reduce IOP, reduce the need for medication use, and dramatically reduce the progression to glaucoma. The KDB and GATT, specifically, have also seen wide use in the treatment of congenital glaucoma and juvenile OAG.

Who is the Optimal Patient for a Goniotomy and in Whom Should It Be Avoided?

Historically, the usual patients for traditional goniotomy are children with primary congenital glaucoma being its most common indication. Qualities that made a patient an optimal candidate for goniotomy procedures are young age, clear corneas, uncontrolled IOP, and multi drug allergies. Recently, with new data on the safety and efficacy of cataract surgery and goniotomy in lowering IOP, this is being performed much more. Although it can be used for treating any severity of glaucoma, goniotomy should be avoided in patients with low IOP targets, as they would experience significantly reduced therapeutic effects which would not justify the risk of complications. Other contraindications include angle dysgenesis, poor angle visualization, corneal clouding, low angle pigmentation, and any other condition that may result in non-identifiable angle structures.MIGS goniotomy is also best avoided in patients with ocular inflammation, neovascular glaucoma, and vitreous collapse into the anterior chamber.

### Postoperative glaucoma following infantile cataract surgery: an individual patient data meta-analysis [^111S9P56]. JAMA Ophthalmology (2014). Medium credibility.

Importance

Infantile cataract surgery bears a significant risk for postoperative glaucoma, and no consensus exists on factors that may reduce this risk.

Objective

To assess the effect of primary intraocular lens implantation and timing of surgery on the incidence of postoperative glaucoma.

Data Sources

We searched multiple databases to July 14, 2013, to identify studies with eligible patients, including PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, ISI Web of Science, Scopus, Central, Google Scholar, Intute, and Tripdata. We also searched abstracts of ophthalmology society meetings.

Study Selection

We included studies reporting on postoperative glaucoma in infants undergoing cataract surgery with regular follow-up for at least 1 year. Infants with concurrent ocular anomalies were excluded.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Authors of eligible studies were invited to contribute individual patient data on infants who met the inclusion criteria. We also performed an aggregate data meta-analysis of published studies that did not contribute to the individual patient data. Data were pooled using a random-effects model.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Time to glaucoma with the effect of primary implantation, additional postoperative intraocular procedures, and age at surgery.

Results

Seven centers contributed individual patient data on 470 infants with a median age at surgery of 3.0 months and median follow-up of 6.0 years. Eighty patients (17.0%) developed glaucoma at a median follow-up of 4.3 years. Only 2 of these patients had a pseudophakic eye. The risk for postoperative glaucoma appeared to be lower after primary implantation (hazard ratio [HR], 0.10 [95% CI, 0.01–0.70]; p = 0.02; I(2) = 34%), higher after surgery at 4 weeks or younger (HR, 2.10 [95% CI, 1.14–3.84]; p = 0.02; I(2) = 0%), and higher after additional procedures (HR, 2.52 [95% CI, 1.11–5.72]; p = 0.03; I(2) = 32%). In multivariable analysis, additional procedures independently increased the risk for glaucoma (HR, 2.25 [95% CI, 1.20–4.21]; p = 0.01), and primary implantation independently reduced it (HR, 0.10 [95% CI, 0.01–0.76]; p = 0.03). Results were similar in the aggregate data meta-analysis that included data from 10 published articles.

Conclusions and Relevance

Although confounding factors such as size of the eye and surgeon experience are not accounted for in this meta-analysis, the risk for postoperative glaucoma after infantile cataract surgery appears to be influenced by the timing of surgery, primary implantation, and additional intraocular surgery.

### Cataract surgery: factors influencing decision to treat and implications for training (south-east scotland 2008–2014) [^1133u7L5]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

The purpose of this observational, retrospective study was to identify main factors that influenced referral for cataract surgery and investigate the electronic patient record dataset from years 2008 to 2014 on patient demographics, co-morbidities, and cataract surgery trends. In particular, we wanted to investigate and compare the patient population that did and did not have cataract surgery in order to establish the main reasons for patients not having cataract surgery, and to evaluate the efficiency of our current cataract surgery service. A second goal was to identify patients who were or were not suitable, as the case may be, for ophthalmic training.

### Defining outcome measures in juvenile idiopathic arthritis associated uveitis by a systematic review analysis: do we need a consensus? [^111QfNnW]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Surgery

Patients with JIA-U frequently require cataract surgery, vitrectomy, and glaucoma surgery. Cataract extraction with or without implantation of an intraocular lens was the most frequent procedure, followed by pars plana vitrectomy and glaucoma filtering surgery. It was shown that a history of intraocular surgery before presentation was significantly associated with 20/50 or worse and 20/200 or worse vision. Sabri et al. in a retrospective chart review of 1081 patients under 18 years of age with uveitis, also demonstrated that surgery was the single most important risk factor for reduced visual acuity at the last follow-up (p = 0.0086). However, in this study, the total number of surgeries, the types of surgery and the time interval from uveitis onset to the first surgery were not statistically significant risk factors for a reduced visual acuity outcome. Heiligenhaus et al. suggested that surgery is not a primary outcome measure because indications for surgery and the surgical methods used are biased by the practice patterns of the treating ophthalmologist. Moreover, surgery might induce further inflammation of the eye, therefore, it may confound activity outcome studies. Despite this any surgery at baseline and/or after study entry should be documented as an indicator of severity of disease and tissue damage.

### Unmet needs for cataract surgery in Spain according to indication criteria. evaluation through a simulation model [^113TXfkY]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2008). Low credibility.

Aims

Despite the increase in cataract surgery rates, the volume of unmet needs for this type of surgery in the population is substantial due to ageing and widening of the indication criteria. Our objective was to assess future trends in needs for cataract surgery according to different scenarios of indication criteria.

Methods

A discrete-event simulation model was built for the population aged 50 years or older in five regions of Spain (45.7% of the population). Different scenarios of worse eye visual acuity thresholds for indication criteria were compared. Data from the North London Eye Study were used to project the baseline needs for surgery onto the study population. The surgery rate of each region was calculated using the Minimum Data Set. The model used data for the year 2003 and the simulation horizon was 5 years.

Results

The volume of need predicted for the year 2008 when scenarios of 0.5 (20/40) and 0.4 (20/50) visual acuity thresholds were used was 69,214 and 51,315 surgeries needed per million inhabitants, respectively. However, unmet needs decreased when a 0.3 (20/70) threshold was used. The increment in the cataract surgery rate needed to prevent the cataract backlog from increasing was 60% for a 0.5 threshold and 50% for a 0.4 threshold.

Conclusion

Application of indication criteria following current guidelines would substantially increase unmet needs for surgery in the next 5 years.

### Effect of combined mature cataract surgery and intravitreal ranibizumab injection in eyes with pre-existing diabetic macular edema [^113DSfhD]. BMC Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The global prevalence of diabetes, longer life expectancies, and an aging population are expected to significantly increase cataract surgery rates among diabetic patients. Diabetics face a higher risk of postoperative complications, particularly in the presence of unstable hyperglycemia, reduced corneal endothelial cell counts, diabetic retinopathy (DR), or diabetic macular edema (DME). Approximately 10% of diabetic patients develop DME, and when combined with cataracts, vision loss can severely impact daily life. Currently, there are no specific guidelines for managing DME during cataract surgery. While surgical intervention effectively treats diabetic cataracts, performing surgery without addressing DME may accelerate retinal disease progression, compromising postoperative vision. Conversely, delaying cataract surgery to treat DME first can hinder retinal monitoring and increase surgical complexity as the cataract worsens. Thus, managing diabetic cataracts with concurrent retinal disease remains a significant challenge for ophthalmologists.

A unique aspect of our study is the focus on patients with preoperatively obscured fundus due to advanced cataracts, a population often excluded from prior research due to the inability to perform high-quality preoperative retinal imaging. In these patients, traditional preoperative fundus examination is often impossible, leading to delayed diagnosis and treatment of DME. This delay can result in irreversible ocular complications and suboptimal visual outcomes. To address this critical gap, we have developed an innovative approach that combines cataract surgery with real-time intraoperative retinal examination techniques, enabling immediate diagnosis and intervention for DME during the surgical procedure.

During the perioperative period, several treatment options are available for DME, including intravitreal anti-VEGF agents, steroids, and laser photocoagulation. Anti-VEGF therapy, supported by extensive literature, has revolutionized DME management globally. Recent studies have highlighted the protective and beneficial effects of intravitreal injections administered during cataract surgery. Previous studies have demonstrated that intravitreal ranibizumab injection immediately after cataract surgery or within the first postoperative week can effectively prevent or treat diabetic macular edema (DME) in patients with diabetic retinopathy. Unlike previous studies, our research innovatively combined three intraoperative retinal examination techniques, enabling real preoperatively obscured fundus-time observation and evaluation of retinal conditions during cataract surgery, particularly in patients with obscured fundi. This approach is particularly valuable for patients with advanced cataracts, where traditional preoperative fundus examination is often impossible.

The present study aims to evaluate the functional and anatomical outcomes of combined cataract surgery and intravitreal anti-VEGF injection in eyes with pre-existing DME and preoperatively obscured fundus. By focusing on this specific patient population, our research addresses a critical gap in clinical practice, offering a novel strategy for timely diagnosis and intervention during cataract surgery.

### Types of intraocular lenses for cataract surgery in eyes with uveitis [^112GW9yT]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Cataract formation often occurs in people with uveitis. It is unclear which intraocular lens (IOL) type is optimal for use in cataract surgery for eyes with uveitis.

Objectives

To summarize the effects of different IOLs on visual acuity, other visual outcomes, and quality of life in people with uveitis.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group Trials Register) (The Cochrane Library 2013, Issue 7), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily, Ovid OLDMEDLINE (January 1946 to August 2013), EMBASE (January 1980 to August 2013), Latin American and Caribbean Literature on Health Sciences (LILACS) (January 1982 to August 2013), the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) (www.controlled-trials.com), ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov) and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 14 August 2013. We also performed forward and backward searching using the Science Citation Index and the reference lists of the included studies, respectively, in August 2013.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing hydrophobic or hydrophilic acrylic, silicone, or poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) IOLs with or without heparin-surface modification (HSM), with each other, or with no treatment in adults with uveitis, for any indication, undergoing cataract surgery.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration. Two review authors screened the search results and for included studies, assessed the risk of bias and extracted data independently. We contacted study investigators for additional information. We did not perform a meta-analysis due to variability in reporting and follow-up intervals for the primary and secondary outcomes of interest.

Main Results

We included four RCTs involving 216 participants (range of 2 to 140 participants with uveitic cataract per trial) and comparing up to four types of IOLs. The largest study was an international study with centers in Brazil, Egypt, Finland, France, Japan, the Netherlands, Slovak Republic, Spain, and the United States; two studies were conducted in Germany and one in Saudi Arabia. There was substantial heterogeneity with respect to the ages of participants and etiologies of uveitis within and across studies. The length of follow-up among the studies ranged from 1 to 24 months after cataract surgery. The studies were at low risk of selection bias, but two of the four studies did not employ masking and only one study included all randomized participants in the final analyses. The funding source was disclosed by investigators of the largest study (professional society) and not reported by the other three. Due to heterogeneity in lens types evaluated and outcomes reported among the trials, we did not combine data in a meta-analysis. In the largest study (140 participants), the study eye of each participant was randomized to receive one of four types of IOLs: hydrophobic acrylic, silicone, HSM PMMA, or unmodified PMMA. Proportions of participants with one or more Snellen lines of visual improvement were similar among the four treatment groups at one year' follow-up: 45 of 48 (94%) in the hydrophobic acrylic IOL group, 39 of 44 (89%) in the silicone IOL group, 18 of 22 (82%) in the HSM PMMA IOL group, and 22 of 26 (85%) in the unmodified PMMA IOL group. When comparing hydrophobic acrylic IOLs with silicone IOLs, the risk ratio (RR) was 1.06 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.93 to 1.20). At one year' follow-up, fewer eyes randomized to hydrophobic acrylic IOLs developed posterior synechiae when compared with eyes receiving silicone IOLs (RR 0.18, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.79); the effects between these groups were less certain with respect to developing posterior capsule opacification (PCO) (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.41 to 1.37), corneal edema (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.22 to 1.12), cystoid macular edema (RR 0.10, 95% CI 0.01 to 1.84), or mild IOL decentration (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.06 to 14.22). Two intra-individual studies also compared HSM PMMA IOLs with unmodified PMMA IOLs at three or six months of follow-up. These studies, including a combined total of 16 participants with uveitis, were insufficiently powered to detect differences in outcomes among eyes of people with uveitis randomized to receive HSM PMMA IOLs when compared with fellow eyes receiving unmodified PMMA IOLs. In the fourth study (60 participants), the study eye of each participant was randomized to receive a hydrophobic or hydrophilic acrylic IOL. At three months, there were no statistical or clinical differences between hydrophobic and hydrophilic acrylic IOL types in the proportions of participants with two or more Snellen lines of visual improvement (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.22). There were similar rates in the development of PCO between hydrophobic or hydrophilic acrylic IOLs at six months' follow-up (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.25). The effect of the lenses on posterior synechiae was uncertain at six months' follow-up (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.05 to 5.22). None of the included studies reported quality of life outcomes.

Authors' Conclusions

Based on the trials identified in this review, there is uncertainty as to which type of IOL provides the best visual and clinical outcomes in people with uveitis undergoing cataract surgery. The studies were small, not all lens materials were compared in all studies, and not all lens materials were available in all study sites. Evidence of a superior effect of hydrophobic acrylic lenses over silicone lenses, specifically for posterior synechiae outcomes comes from a single study at a high risk of performance and detection bias. However, due to small sample sizes and heterogeneity in outcome reporting, we found insufficient information to assess these and other types of IOL materials for cataract surgery for eyes with uveitis.

### Cataract in the adult eye preferred practice pattern [^116CYtZF]. Ophthalmology (2022). High credibility.

Preoperative management of uveitis — quiescence and corticosteroids: Ideally, inflammation should be inactive or controlled as much as possible before surgery, and many uveitis specialists advocate 3 months or more of quiescence before surgery as this reduces the risk of postoperative cystoid macular edema (CME); even if a patient is on chronic anti-inflammatory therapy, additional topical and/or oral corticosteroids are often recommended before surgery to pre-empt severe postoperative exacerbations, and in one study, preoperative treatment with oral corticosteroids seemed to decrease the risk of postoperative CME. The medical regimen should be individualized based on the severity and sequelae of past episodes and prior control, and surgical procedures may need to be modified to manage pre-existing posterior synechiae, pupillary membranes, zonular compromise, and fibrotic scarring of the pupillary margin.

### Surgical strategies for coexisting glaucoma and cataract: an evidence-based update [^111u111s]. Ophthalmology (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess short- and long-term control of intraocular pressure (IOP) with different surgical treatment strategies for coexisting cataract and glaucoma.

Design

Systematic literature review and analysis.

Method

We performed a search of the published literature to identify all eligible articles pertaining to the surgical management of coexisting cataract and glaucoma in adults. One investigator abstracted the content of each article onto a custom-designed form. A second investigator corroborated the findings. The evidence supporting different approaches was graded by consensus as good, fair, weak, or insufficient.

Main Outcome Measures

Short-term (24 hours or fewer) and long-term (more than 24 hours) IOP control.

Results

The evidence was good that long-term IOP is lowered more by combined glaucoma and cataract operations than by cataract operations alone. On average, the IOP was 3 to 4 mmHg lower in the combined groups with fewer medications required. The evidence was weak that extracapsular cataract extraction (ECCE) alone results in short-term increase in IOP and was insufficient to determine the short-term impact of phacoemulsification cataract extraction (PECE) on IOP in glaucoma patients. The evidence was weak that short-term IOP control was better with ECCE or PECE combined with an incisional glaucoma procedure compared with ECCE or PECE alone. The evidence was also weak (but consistent) that long-term IOP is lowered by 2 to 4 mmHg after ECCE or PECE. Finally, there was weak evidence that combined PECE and trabeculectomy produces slightly worse long-term IOP control than trabeculectomy alone, and there was fair evidence that the same is true for ECCE combined with trabeculectomy.

Conclusions

There is strong evidence for better long-term control of IOP with combined glaucoma and cataract operations compared with cataract surgery alone. For other issues regarding surgical treatment strategies for cataract and glaucoma, the available evidence is limited or conflicting.

### Systematic analysis of levels of evidence supporting American Academy of Ophthalmology preferred practice pattern guidelines, 2012–2021 [^1115d8CP]. BMC Ophthalmology (2023). Medium credibility.

The same report from the Institute of Medicine also proposed that "recommendations should be articulated in a standardized form detailing precisely what the recommendation action is, and under what circumstances it should be performed". Our findings demonstrated that aside from indication of recommendation strengths (n = 104 recommendations across 24 PPPs), the current guidelines do not articulate recommendations in a standardized form.

Without such standardization, our comprehensive review of the 2021 Cataract in the Adult Eye PPP identified 510 statements that addressed how patients should be diagnosed or managed clinically and thus could be considered recommendations. While the agreement between our two reviewers was good (k statistic = 0.64), this result suggests that interpretations of potential recommendation statements in the PPP can be variable. Standardized articulation of recommendations would help clinicians clearly identify recommended actions for clinical practice. For example, American Heart Association guidelines list all recommendations in visually distinctive boxes, which stand out from the surrounding text and include levels of evidence. Clearly articulating recommendations could also facilitate the creation and assessment of programs to improve the quality of care.

As health care usage and expenditure continue to rise in the United States, value-based care has become an increasingly important concept. A recent systematic review found that between 75.7 and 101.2 billion was spent on low-value care in the United States. Clinical practice guidelines play an important role in shaping practice patterns and thus may be well-suited to promote high-value care. In this area, prior work in cardiology has evaluated cost and value considerations in contemporary heart failure clinical guidelines. The study concluded that although most contemporary heart failure guidelines contained cost/value statements, they were rarely used to support clinical guidance recommendations.

In the ophthalmology guidelines, a majority (88%) of PPPs included cost/value statements. In particular, the high economic impact of disease or care was frequently highlighted (75% of PPPs). However, cost/value considerations have yet to be incorporated into the development of specific recommendations, representing an avenue for future work in ophthalmology guideline development. More than half of the PPPs also reported gaps in cost/value evidence — ongoing efforts in the field such as the IRIS® Registry, which includes performance metrics, may facilitate real-world evidence generation in this area and help to provide needed data for guideline development.

### Oral sedation is non-inferior to intravenous sedation for cornea and glaucoma surgery: a randomized controlled trial [^1156W9Tq]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2022). Medium credibility.

Our subjects were racially and ethnically diverse, and had a wide variety of concurrent medical conditions. However, we only enrolled patients who were low risk candidates for oral sedation with a benzodiazepine. Also, certain case types were excluded, such as micropulse transcleral cyclophotocoagulation (TSCPC) (IRIDEX Corp. Mountain View, CA), deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty (DALK) or penetrating keratoplasty (PKP). The reason for exclusion of patients undergoing micropulse TSCPC was that it is usually performed with brief, very deep sedation due to the amount of pain generally associated with this short treatment, and the study medication dosages were thought to be inadequate. DALK and PKP are often performed under general anesthesia. In order to avoid selecting some DALK/PKP patients to be eligible for the study over others planned for general anesthesia, all DALK and PKP patients were excluded. Thus, our results do not suggest that oral sedation is appropriate for all patients undergoing anterior segment surgeries; rather, they indicate that oral sedation may be a suitable alternative to IV sedation for patients who meet a certain set of criteria that have yet to be fully determined.

We relied on the use of the Iowa Satisfaction with Anesthesia Survey (ISAS) to assess our primary outcome, patient satisfaction. This tool was previously validated for use with cataract surgery, but has not specifically been validated for use in cornea, conjunctiva, or glaucoma surgeries. We still believe that it was appropriate to use the ISAS, as this tool has been successfully used in research across a wide variety of surgery types, including other ophthalmic surgeries. Furthermore, using a survey as the primary endpoint measurement always runs the risk of introducing bias, as responses may be influenced by the subject's expectations and beliefs, even if masking is maintained. This is especially relevant in the context of a non-inferiority study, as there is the potential for this type of analysis to determine non-inferiority when there is none. However, to protect against this, we selected a non-inferiority margin such that any subtle differences between the two groups would not be clinically relevant and would not affect our analysis. Additionally, the range of responses seen in patients (range 2.58–6.00), surgeons (range 1.33–6.00), and anesthesia provider (range 2.17–6.00) did not suggest the presence of any noticeable bias.

Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) in cataract candidates — preoperative imaging and risk: The presence and extent of AMD may be identified preoperatively using optical coherence tomography (OCT) and fluorescein angiography to help establish realistic expectations, but these tests do not assist with prediction of visual potential, and the risk of pre‑existing AMD worsening following cataract surgery is low compared with its natural history.

### Cataract surgery in the extremely small eye: morphology, comorbidities and outcomes in 300 eyes [^114gHG8F]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

Preoperative ocular comorbidities and indication for cataract surgery

44 eyes (14.7%) were amblyopic. 7.3% of the study eyes had undergone previous strabismus surgery prior to cataract surgery. Previous corneal surgery, refractive surgery, vitrectomy, lid surgery as well as indication for intravitreal therapy were rare (see table 1).

Table 1
Patient cohort characteristics

Glaucoma prevalence with 12.7% was elevated in our study population compared with population-based values for a Caucasian population at 70 years of age with 4.8% as presented by Johansson et al. While previous filtrating surgery and angle surgery were uncommon (1% of study population), 9.4% of the study population had undergone an iridotomy prior to cataract surgery. As to be expected, the two morphologies with a small anterior segment, namely N and RAM, had the highest preoperative iridotomy rates (13.2% and 26.3%, respectively). This is further reflected in the indication for surgery, which was not only based on visual acuity, but was further indicated as an antiglaucomatous cataract surgery in 10% of cases.

### Variability and costs of low-value preoperative testing for cataract surgery within the veterans health administration [^115UfTHF]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Discussion

About half of patients presenting for cataract surgical procedures within an integrated health care system, the VHA, received at least 1 preoperative LVT in FY 2017 — approximately 4 years after release of the Choosing Wisely campaign by the American Academy of Ophthalmology. Our findings demonstrate patterns of low-value testing across a large sample (69 070 surgical procedures) in a nationwide, geographically diverse network of hospitals for multiple important characteristics: facility type (ranging from those supporting basic ambulatory procedures to others that routinely conduct complex inpatient surgical procedures); receipt of MAC or GA; patient gender, age, and race/ethnicity; and various comorbidities. While the most common LVT was an ECG, we noted frequent use of lower-cost blood tests as well as more expensive chest radiographs and cardiac stress tests.

Our findings are pertinent to clinical practice given the well-established guidelines by the Choosing Wisely Campaign for limiting preoperative testing before low-risk surgical procedures. Systemic complications following cataract surgery are extremely rare, with 30-day mortality being below 0.1%. However, over the past decade, data indicate that cataract procedures have a substantial likelihood for patients to be seen for a preoperative consult, many of which include routine testing. As the US population continues to age, these evaluations are likely to grow owing to the existence of multiple comorbidities in older cataract surgery patients compared with the typical surgical patient. Although preoperative testing can potentially be used for stratification and reduction of risk for major procedures, in the setting of low-risk operations its value has not been demonstrated. Routine preoperative medical testing did not change the risk of intraoperative or postoperative ocular adverse events when compared with selective or no testing in 3 large randomized clinical trials of cataract surgery patients. Most events were cardiovascular and occurred during the intraoperative period, further suggesting that routine preoperative testing does not increase the safety of cataract operations.

### Cataract surgery patient-reported outcome measures: a head-to-head comparison of the psychometric performance and patient acceptability of the cat-PROM5 and catquest-9SF self-report questionnaires [^1124YWA4]. Eye (2018). Low credibility.

Background Cataract surgery is the most frequently undertaken NHS surgical procedure. Visual acuity (VA) provides a poor indication of visual difficulty in a complex visual world. In the absence of a suitable outcome metric, recent efforts have been directed towards the development of a cataract patient-reported outcome measure (PROM) of sufficient brevity, precision, and responsiveness to be implementable in routine high volume clinical services.

Aim To compare and contrast the two most promising candidate PROMs for routine cataract surgery.

Method The psychometric performance and patient acceptability of the recently UK developed five-item Cat-PROM5 questionnaire was compared with the English translation of the Swedish nine-item Catquest-9SF using Rasch-based performance metrics and qualitative semistructured interviews.

Results Rasch-based performance was assessed in 822 typical NHS cataract surgery patients across four centres in England. Both questionnaires demonstrated good to excellent performance for all metrics assessed, including Person Reliability Indices of 0.90 (Cat-PROM5) and 0.88 (Catquest-9SF), responsiveness to surgery (Cohen's standardized effect size) of 1.45 SD (Cat-PROM5) and 1.47 SD (Catquest-9SF) and they were highly correlated with each other (R = 0.85). Qualitative assessments confirmed that both questionnaires were acceptable to patients, including in the presence of ocular comorbidities. Preferences were expressed for the shorter Cat-PROM5, which allowed patients to map their own issues to the questions as opposed to the more restrictive specific scenarios of Catquest-9SF.

Conclusion The recently UK developed Cat-PROM5 cataract surgery questionnaire is shorter, with performance and patient acceptability at least as good or better than the previous 'best of class' Catquest-9SF instrument.

Patients with medical risk factors

A number of other medical conditions are associated with dry eye; collagen vascular disease, refractive surgery, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, vitamin A deficiency and androgen insufficiency have high levels of evidence for an association with dry eye, while diabetes mellitus, human immunodeficiency virus infection, systemic chemotherapy, some types of cataract surgery, keratoplasty, sarcoidosis and ovarian dysfunction are also candidate risk factors with at least moderate evidence. Dry eye can also be iatrogenic; there is at least moderately strong evidence showing antihistamines, some antidepressants, diuretics and beta-blockers as risk factors for dry eye. While cancer itself is not a risk factor for dry eye, radiation therapy and some types of systemic chemotherapy are.

Similarly, MGD has been associated with a number of medical treatments including antihistamines, antidepressants, antiandrogens and isotretinoin drugs used for treating benign prostatic hyperplasia. The degree of overlap between those drugs identified as potential risk factors for dry eye and those associated with MGD is notable. The list of medical conditions that may be associated with MGD is long, but includes androgen deficiency, atopy (and perhaps associated antihistamine use), benign prostatic hyperplasia, hypertension, menopause, Parkinson's disease, rosacea, Sjögren's syndrome and others.

Clearly, there is a wide range of medical conditions and medical treatments that put patients at increased risk of OSD. Many of these conditions are more prevalent among older patients and, therefore, frequently comorbid with glaucoma. Avoiding preservatives in the glaucoma medication of patients already at risk of OSD because of pre-existing medical conditions or those that develop during the course of their glaucoma treatment would seem to be the responsible course of action.

Presurgical patients

Trabeculotomy or filtration surgery is a common procedure used in patients in whom topical glaucoma therapy does not adequately control IOP or in those who fail to tolerate topical medication sufficiently well. A link between impaired outcome of trabecular surgery and long-term topical therapy has long been suspected. The role of toxic effects of preservatives in precipitating inflammatory and fibrotic changes in the ocular surface is now well recognized and some of the mechanisms have been elucidated.–It would thus seem reasonable that patients in whom filtration surgery might become indicated in the future be spared the additional risk of a poor surgical outcome by using preservative-free, rather than preservative-added medication in the initial stages of their illness.

### A proposed minimum standard set of outcome measures for cataract surgery [^115xRC6u]. JAMA Ophthalmology (2015). Medium credibility.

Importance

Aligning outcome measures for cataract surgery, one of the most frequently performed procedures globally, may facilitate international comparisons that can drive improvements in the outcomes most meaningful to patients.

Objective

To propose a minimum standard set of outcome measures for cataract surgery that enables global comparisons.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A working group of international experts in cataract outcomes and registries was convened, along with a patient advocate, to agree on a consensus of outcome measures for cataract surgery. In a modified Delphi process, the group met regularly between November 10, 2012, and November 21, 2013, to discuss which outcomes to include in a standard set. Included factors were based on extant literature, existing registries, and the experience of group members. Similarly, a series of consensus discussions were held to determine a set of risk factors to be gathered for each patient. The final shortlist was compiled into a standard set. Analysis was performed from November 22, 2013, to April 5, 2014.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Development of a recommended standard set encompassing preoperative metrics including patient risk factors, intraoperative factors including surgical complications, and postoperative cataract surgery outcomes.

Results

The recommended standard set encompasses all patients treated for cataracts by 1 of 4 surgical approaches (phacoemulsification, sutured manual extracapsular cataract extraction, sutureless manual extracapsular cataract extraction, or intracapsular cataract extraction). The recommended metrics to be recorded preoperatively include demographics, ocular history and comorbidities, preoperative visual acuity, and patient-reported visual function. The recommended outcomes were split into intraoperative and postoperative metrics. Intraoperative outcomes include capsule-related problems, dislocation of lens nucleus fragments into the vitreous, and other complications. Postoperative outcomes include visual acuity, refractive error, patient-reported visual function, and early and late complications of surgery. The suggested follow-up for collection of postoperative outcomes is up to 3 months.

Conclusions and Relevance

A minimum standard set of outcome measures for cataract surgery is important for meaningful comparison across contexts. The proposed data set is a compromise between all useful data and the practicalities of data collection.

1978. 03910050294023. With approximately 400, 000 cataract operations performed yearly in the United States, that there is no universally accepted set of indications for cataract extraction, other than the fact that a "cataract" is present, is surprising. The reason for this lack of universal agreement on indications for surgery lies in the word itself. "Cataract" is not a distinct clinical entity, as are cancer and syphilis, but is actually a continuum that includes any opacity of the lens, ranging from a small congenital lens opacity without any effect on vision to a completely opaque lens where no view of the fundus is possible. Surgical removal in cases of the latter type of lens opacity is not in question when retinal function is deemed to be normal.

### Evidence-based answer… [^113YCi57]. AAFP (2009). Low credibility.

Clinical Question Does preoperative testing before cataract surgery lead to fewer perioperative adverse events. Evidence-Based Answer Routine preoperative testing before cataract surgery does not reduce intraoperative or postoperative complications. Practice Pointers Family physicians commonly provide preoperative examinations and medical clearance before major surgeries. Preoperative medical testing may include screening electrocardiography, chest radiography, complete blood counts, and serum measurements. For a minor surgery such as cataract surgery, it is unclear which specific laboratory or other tests are necessary. The researchers in this Cochrane review identified three randomized controlled trials with a total of 21, 868 patients.

These studies examined rates of intraoperative and postoperative medical adverse events in patients who received routine preoperative medical testing compared with those who did not receive routine testing or those who received selective preoperative testing before cataract surgery. Pooled analysis of these three studies concluded that preoperative medical testing did not reduce the rate of intraoperative or postoperative medical adverse events compared with selective or no testing. No significant differences were reported in the rate or types of intraoperative and postoperative ocular adverse events in the preoperative testing group compared with the selective or no testing groups. There were no differences in postoperative hospitalizations and deaths.

One study also examined testing costs, and it found that those who had routine preoperative medical testing incurred costs 2. 5 times higher than the costs for those who had selective preoperative testing. The American Academy of Ophthalmology recommends against routine medical tests before cataract surgery, although pre-operative medical tests can be ordered when indicated by findings on a patient's history or physical examination. 1 The American Heart Association recommends against the use of routine testing in asymptomatic patients undergoing low-risk procedures such as cataract surgery because the cardiac risk associated with low-risk procedures is generally less than 1 percent. 2.

### Progression of age-related macular degeneration after cataract surgery… [^113QxyiZ]. JAMA Network (2009). Excellent credibility.

The low incidence rate of neovascular AMD development between 1 week and 1 year after cataract surgery did not support the hypothesis that cataract surgery increases the risk of AMD progression. Several eyes appeared to have disease progression on postsurgery week 1 fluorescein angiograms, suggesting that many cases of presumed progression to neovascular AMD following cataract surgery may have been present prior to cataract surgery, but not recognized owing to lens opacity. There has been a long-standing controversy among clinicians as to whether cataract surgery is contraindicated in eyes with nonneovascular AMD. 4–8 A major concern has been whether cataract surgery increases the risk of progression to neovascular AMD in eyes at risk of progression such as those with intermediate AMD.

While some researchers observed higher rates of advanced-stage AMD in eyes with a history of cataract surgery, 9–12 others have cited an association between progression to neovascular AMD and performance of cataract surgery. 4, 6, 13–17 Van der Schaft et al9 observed more frequent disciform scar formation secondary to AMD in postmortem pseudophakic eyes when compared with age-matched phakic eyes. Researchers from the Beaver Dam Eye Study and the Blue Mountain Eye Study reported that a history of cataract surgery at baseline increased the risk of advanced AMD at the 5-year examination 3- to 10-fold. 13–15 A positive association between cataract surgery and 10-year incidence of advanced AMD from the Blue Mountain Eye Study was also reported. 16 These observations have led many to suspect a cause-and-effect relationship between cataract surgery and incident neovascular AMD; however, observational studies have methodological limitations in controlling bias compared with prospective studies.

Additional findings from case series have suggested that patients with AMD who have cataract surgery are at higher risk for AMD progression. 6, 17 Pollack et al6 followed up 47 subjects who had bilateral symmetric stages of nonneovascular AMD and underwent cataract surgery in only 1 eye. Color fundus photographs and fluorescein angiography were done preoperatively and postoperatively up to 1 year. The rate of progression to neovascular AMD within 1 year of surgery was higher in the eyes that received surgery when compared with the observed fellow eyes. However, selection of the eye to undergo cataract surgery was not random, potentially permitting bias into the selection. It is possible that a systematic bias occurred that entailed selecting the eye at greater risk of progression or already harboring neovascular AMD to undergo the cataract surgery. Participants were matched by supplement treatment, gender, age, baseline AMD characteristics, and years of follow-up.

No increase in rates of progression to neovascular AMD were identified following cataract surgery when compared with individuals who remained phakic. 19 In a case-control study of 499 subjects with recent-onset unilateral neovascular maculopathy, Sutter and colleagues20 found no differences in the phakic status of the eyes with neovascular AMD vs the fellow eyes without neovascular AMD. Of 108 subjects enrolled, 86 were included in this analysis. Twenty-two participants were excluded for lack of fluorescein angiograms owing to fluorescein allergy at enrollment; ungradable preoperative fundus images; absence of AMD on review of baseline images; absence of preoperative AMD in the study eye and no confirmed AMD in the fellow eye; or definite or probable neovascular AMD on the preoperative images.
