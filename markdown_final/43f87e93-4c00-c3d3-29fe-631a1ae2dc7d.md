## Question

melena

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about melena. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining melena and its pathophysiology. Then, I should verify the differential diagnosis and how often melena reflects upper versus lower GI bleeding. Next, I will review the initial assessment, risk stratification, and resuscitation thresholds. After that, I need to check the diagnostic algorithm, including the role of EGD, colonoscopy, and small-bowel evaluation. I will then examine special populations and mimics, and finally synthesize management principles and a concise algorithm, making sure I double-check any points that seem uncertain as I go.

> Let me first confirm the definition and pathophysiology. Melena is black, tarry stool resulting from oxidation of hemoglobin to hematin during prolonged contact with gastric acid and digestive enzymes; this typically requires at least 50–100 mL of blood in the upper GI tract and slowed intestinal transit, which is why melena strongly suggests an upper GI source, though slower bleeding from the right colon can occasionally produce melena as well [^111NBVne] [^111WQ8x7].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about location. I should verify the likelihood that melena indicates upper versus lower GI bleeding. High-quality evidence shows that melena substantially increases the likelihood of upper GI bleeding, with likelihood ratios around 5–6 for a history of melena and as high as 25 when melenic stool is observed on exam, whereas blood clots in stool make upper GI bleeding much less likely; importantly, about 15% of patients with presumed lower GI bleeding ultimately have an upper source, so I need to keep both possibilities in mind during triage [^113u9Lat] [^111WQ8x7].

> Next, I should review the differential diagnosis. Common upper GI causes include peptic ulcer disease, erosive gastritis/esophagitis, variceal bleeding, Mallory–Weiss tears, and malignancy; lower GI sources that can rarely present with melena include right-sided angiodysplasia, tumors, and ischemia; I also need to remember mimics such as iron, bismuth, charcoal, and ingested blood, which can darken stool without true bleeding, so I should confirm the history carefully before labeling melena [^111NBVne] [^116zMWmW] [^113tmnsi].

> I will now examine the initial assessment and risk stratification. I need to check hemodynamics immediately, because supine tachycardia suggests 500–1000 mL blood loss and orthostatic changes suggest even greater volume depletion; I should calculate a Glasgow-Blatchford score to predict the need for intervention, recognizing that a Blatchford score of 0 predicts a less than 1% chance of needing intervention and supports outpatient management in select cases; I should also obtain CBC, electrolytes, BUN/creatinine, coagulation profile, liver tests, and type and crossmatch, noting that a BUN:creatinine ratio above 30 increases the likelihood of upper GI bleeding, though I must interpret this cautiously in the setting of renal dysfunction [^111B2wFG] [^113u9Lat] [^117QkxCE].

> Wait, let me verify resuscitation thresholds. For most adults without coronary disease, a restrictive transfusion strategy with a hemoglobin threshold of 7 g/dL is recommended; higher thresholds may be appropriate in patients with ischemic heart disease or ongoing shock, and I should transfuse platelets or correct coagulopathy based on the clinical context and antithrombotic use, while initiating IV proton pump inhibitor therapy empirically for suspected upper GI bleeding [^111B2wFG] [^1127G6rW].

> Next, I should review the diagnostic algorithm. The standard approach is esophagogastroduodenoscopy as the first-line test for melena because most cases reflect upper GI bleeding; if EGD is negative or non-diagnostic, I should proceed to colonoscopy within about 24 hours after appropriate preparation, given the possibility of a right colonic source; if both EGD and colonoscopy are negative and bleeding persists or recurs, I should evaluate the small bowel with video capsule endoscopy or deep enteroscopy, with second-look endoscopy considered if the initial exams were incomplete or suspicion remains high [^112mcAHz] [^113Dom9m] [^116cb1iY].

> But wait, what if the patient is unstable or has massive bleeding? I should double-check the role of nasogastric lavage. Although NG aspiration can support an upper source if blood or coffee grounds are returned, its diagnostic performance is limited and a negative lavage does not exclude upper GI bleeding, so I should not rely on it to decide against EGD; in unstable patients, I should prioritize resuscitation and urgent endoscopy rather than delaying for NG lavage [^111KWV8N] [^111NBVne].

> I need to ensure I address special populations and mimics. In children, swallowed maternal blood, Meckel's diverticulum, and HSP are important considerations; in older adults, angiodysplasia and malignancy are more common; in patients with cirrhosis, variceal bleeding and portal hypertensive gastropathy are key; in ventricular assist device patients, GI bleeding is common and push enteroscopy is often indicated; and I should always ask about iron, bismuth, charcoal, and dietary blood to avoid misclassification of pseudo-melena [^11137UiV] [^114Gow8N] [^112rECaA] [^114HF3BL] [^116zMWmW].

> Let me consider management principles by etiology. For nonvariceal upper GI bleeding, I should continue high-dose PPI therapy, perform hemostasis with endoscopic therapy for high-risk stigmata, and continue PPI for 72 hours post-endoscopy; for variceal bleeding, I should use octreotide, antibiotics for prophylaxis, and consider band ligation or sclerotherapy, with TIPS reserved for refractory cases; for lower GI sources found on colonoscopy, I should apply endoscopic hemostasis techniques such as injection, clips, or thermal therapy as appropriate; for obscure bleeding after negative bidirectional endoscopy, I should pursue capsule endoscopy and, if positive, deep enteroscopy for diagnosis and therapy [^114ZJw7s] [^11255Tzn] [^116cb1iY].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of imaging when endoscopy is unavailable or inconclusive. CT angiography can localize active bleeding and guide embolization, while nuclear medicine bleeding scans can detect slow intermittent bleeding; provocative angiography may be considered in obscure, recurrent cases when noninvasive tests are unrevealing, but I need to balance risks and benefits carefully [^114g26vg] [^111j2R8F] [^111Acj4R].

> I should double-check the timing of endoscopy. In high-risk patients with hematemesis or melena and a Blatchford score ≥ 12, performing EGD within 6 hours of consultation increases the use of endoscopic therapy compared with 6–24 hours, though mortality benefits are less consistent; nonetheless, early endoscopy remains standard for unstable patients or those with high-risk features [^116irh5A] [^111NBVne].

> Let me reconsider the key takeaways to ensure internal consistency. Melena is a marker of significant GI bleeding that most often reflects an upper GI source but can occasionally arise from the right colon; urgent hemodynamic assessment, risk stratification, and resuscitation are essential; EGD is first-line, followed by colonoscopy if negative, and then small-bowel evaluation if bleeding persists; and I must actively exclude mimics and tailor management to the identified source and patient risk profile [^113u9Lat] [^112mcAHz] [^116cb1iY].

Melena is **black, tarry stool** from oxidized hemoglobin after upper gastrointestinal bleeding, most often due to peptic ulcer disease, gastritis, esophageal varices, or Mallory-Weiss tears [^111NBVne]. It is a medical emergency requiring **immediate evaluation** with ABCs, labs (CBC, BMP, LFTs, coags, type and cross), and urgent upper endoscopy within 24 hours [^1127G6rW] [^116irh5A]. Management includes IV PPI, correction of coagulopathy, and transfusion to hemoglobin ≥ 7 g/dL unless CAD or ongoing ischemia is present [^1127G6rW] [^111B2wFG]. Delayed presentation is common and increases transfusion risk, so **early recognition and intervention are critical** to reduce morbidity and mortality [^1122iCyd] [^111NBVne].

---

## Pathophysiology

Melena results from **oxidation of hemoglobin** to hematin during prolonged intestinal transit, producing the characteristic black, tarry appearance and distinctive odor. This typically requires at least 50–100 mL of blood and slowed transit, explaining why melena usually indicates an upper GI source [^111NBVne].

## Common causes

| **Category** | **Specific causes** |
|-|-|
| Peptic ulcer disease | - Gastric ulcers <br/> - Duodenal ulcers [^111NBVne] |
| Gastritis | - NSAID-induced <br/> - Alcohol-related <br/> - Stress-related [^1127G6rW] |
| Esophageal varices | Portal hypertension due to cirrhosis [^112rECaA] |
| Mallory-Weiss tear | Forceful vomiting or retching [^111NBVne] |
| Malignancy | - Gastric cancer <br/> - Esophageal cancer [^111NBVne] |
| Other | - Dieulafoy's lesion <br/> - Angiodysplasia <br/> - AVMs [^111NBVne] |

---

## Clinical presentation

Patients with melena may present with:

- **Black, tarry stools**: Characteristic appearance and odor [^111NBVne].
- **Abdominal pain**: Often epigastric, varying with underlying cause [^1127G6rW].
- **Hemodynamic instability**: Tachycardia, hypotension, syncope, shock [^113u9Lat].
- **Systemic symptoms**: Fatigue, pallor, dyspnea, chest pain, especially in elderly or comorbid patients [^111NBVne].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

### Initial assessment

Immediate assessment focuses on **airway, breathing, and circulation**, with two large-bore IVs and continuous monitoring. Obtain a focused history covering bleeding history, NSAID/anticoagulant use, liver disease, and prior GI disease, and perform a physical exam including orthostatics, abdominal and rectal examinations [^1127G6rW].

---

### Laboratory tests

- **Complete blood count**: Assess anemia and serial trends [^1127G6rW].
- **Basic metabolic panel**: Evaluate renal function, electrolytes, BUN (elevated BUN:creatinine ratio suggests UGIB) [^113u9Lat].
- **Liver function tests**: Assess hepatic function, especially if varices suspected [^1127G6rW].
- **Coagulation profile**: PT/INR, aPTT, platelets [^1127G6rW].
- **Type and crossmatch**: Prepare for transfusion [^1127G6rW].

---

### Endoscopy

Upper endoscopy (**EGD**) is the gold standard for diagnosing and treating upper GI bleeding sources; it should be performed within 24 hours of presentation, ideally within 6 hours for high-risk patients [^116irh5A] [^1127G6rW].

---

## Management

### General supportive care

General supportive care includes **aggressive IV crystalloids** for hemodynamic stabilization and a restrictive transfusion strategy targeting hemoglobin ≥ 7 g/dL, with a higher threshold (≥ 8–9 g/dL) in patients with CAD or ongoing ischemia [^1127G6rW] [^111B2wFG]. Correct coagulopathy with vitamin K, FFP, or PCC as indicated, and initiate a high-dose IV proton pump inhibitor (PPI) bolus followed by continuous infusion [^1127G6rW].

---

### Endoscopic therapy

Endoscopic therapy includes **hemostatic techniques** such as injection, thermal coagulation, or mechanical clips for active bleeding or high-risk stigmata [^112mcAHz]. Variceal bleeding is managed with band ligation or sclerotherapy, often combined with octreotide or terlipressin [^notfound].

---

### Surgical intervention

Surgical intervention is indicated for **refractory bleeding** despite endoscopic therapy, suspected malignancy, or perforation [^1127G6rW].

---

## Prognosis

Prognosis depends on the **cause, severity, and comorbidities**. Peptic ulcer bleeding has a 5–10% mortality, whereas variceal bleeding carries higher mortality, especially in cirrhosis [^111NBVne]. Delayed presentation is common with melena and increases transfusion risk and complications [^1122iCyd].

---

## Patient education

Patients should be educated to **recognize melena** and seek immediate care, disclose NSAID, anticoagulant, and alcohol use, and adhere to PPI therapy and follow-up endoscopy when indicated [^111d5qqe].

---

Melena is a hallmark of **upper GI bleeding** that demands rapid recognition, stabilization, and definitive endoscopic management. Early intervention reduces morbidity and mortality, and clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion even when patients present late [^111NBVne].

### The role of endoscopy in the patient with lower GI bleeding [^113Dom9m]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2014). Medium credibility.

Melena — diagnostic approach specifies that "EGD is the initial test in the evaluation of melena as the majority of these patients have UGIB". Because lower sources can cause melena, "Melena also may result from slow bleeding emanating from the colon or small-bowel", so "A colonoscopy should, therefore, be pursued after negative results on EGD".

### A "rare" case of melena in a 3-year-old [^116zMWmW]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2011). Low credibility.

Melena is a potential sign of life-threatening upper gastrointestinal bleeding; however, there are numerous substances ingested resulting in a stool appearance similar to melena. Examples of such substances include black licorice, bismuth subsalicylate, and iron supplements. We report a case of a well-appearing 3-year-old Vietnamese girl presenting to our emergency department after 2 episodes of "black, sticky" stool. The cause of her "melena" was determined after father revealed that she had ingested 2 bowls of pork blood soup during the preceding 12 hours. This case highlights the need for a careful dietary history and cultural considerations in children presenting with what may appear to be melena.

### Hematemesis and melena in infant… [^113tmnsi]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Gastrointestinal hemmorrhage may be a serious symptom but in the newborn infant hematemesis and melena may simply be due to maternal blood swallowed during birth. 1–4 We report a case of apparently serious intestinal bleeding in a 10-week-old infant that turned out to be innocent. Report of a Case. — The baby was born normally at term weighing 3, 200 g and had no problems. She was breast-fed from birth and additional cow's milk and orange juice had been introduced. At the age of 10 weeks, she was referred to our pediatric emergency room by her attending physician because of melena and coffee-ground vomiting during a period of several hours. Apart from some reduction in appetite, she was otherwise behaving normally. On examination, she was surprisingly healthy with no pallor, tachycardia, or any other abnormal physical signs. Nevertheless, while being examined she vomited a small amount of coffee-ground material and passed ROTH D, COHEN H. Hematemesis and Melena in Infant.

### Gastrointestinal bleeding [^117XngpF]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Gastrointestinal bleeding is a common complaint encountered in the emergency department and frequent cause of hospitalization. Important diagnostic factors that increase morbidity and mortality include advanced age, serious comorbid conditions, hemodynamic instability, esophageal varices, significant hematemesis or melena, and marked anemia. Because gastrointestinal bleeding carries a 10% overall mortality rate, emergency physicians must perform timely diagnosis, aggressive resuscitation, risk stratification, and early consultation for these patients.

### Diagnostic yield of colonoscopy to evaluate melena after a nondiagnostic EGD [^114rp7HP]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Melena can be caused by bleeding from lower GI sources. Colonoscopy is frequently used to investigate melena after a nondiagnostic EGD.

Objective

To determine the diagnostic yield and rate of therapeutic intervention during colonoscopy in patients with melena and a nondiagnostic EGD.

Design

Retrospective case-control study.

Setting

Community and academic centers over a diverse geographic area in the United States.

Patients

This study involved patients in the Clinical Outcomes Research Initiative database with a colonoscopy performed to investigate melena within 30 days of a nondiagnostic EGD for the same indication. A control group had colonoscopies performed for average-risk screening.

Main Outcome Measurements

The endoscopic finding of a suspected bleeding source defined as right-sided arteriovenous malformation, colitis, polyp ≥ 20 mm, tumor, or ulcer. Rate of therapeutic intervention during colonoscopy.

Results

Colonoscopy found a suspected bleeding source in 4.8% of patients with melena, more frequently than in the control group (odds ratio [OR] 2.17; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.65–2.86; P < .0001). The rate of therapeutic intervention during melena-related colonoscopy was 1.7%. Patients with melena were more likely to have a colon tumor (OR 2.87; 95% CI, 1.82–5.51; P < .0001) than were control patients.

Limitations

Retrospective design, conclusions being dependent on the accuracy of database input, and lack of pertinent clinical data (eg, hemoglobin).

Conclusion

The diagnostic yield of colonoscopy to investigate melena after nondiagnostic EGD is low. The need for therapeutic intervention during colonoscopy for this indication is very low. This population should undergo colonoscopy because they are at increased risk of colorectal cancer. Colonoscopy can potentially be performed electively in stable patients without continued bleeding.

### The role of endoscopy in the patient with lower GI bleeding [^111NoW5z]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2014). Medium credibility.

Lower gastrointestinal bleeding — algorithmic triage (Figure 1) directs evaluation by presentation: for melena proceed to esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and, if there is a "Negative EGD", perform colonoscopy; for occult bleed perform colonoscopy with EGD if colonoscopy is negative and upper GI symptoms are present; for scant intermittent hematochezia use "Age < 40 years; No alarm symptoms/risk factors" to select "Flexible Sigmoidoscopy", whereas "Age > 50 years; Alarm symptoms/risk factors" lead to colonoscopy; "Severe Hematochezia (see algorithm 2)" follows the separate severe hematochezia pathway.

### ACG clinical guideline: management of patients with acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding [^111WQ8x7]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2016). Medium credibility.

Acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding epidemiology and definitions — acute overt lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB) accounts for ~20% of all cases of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, usually leads to hospital admission with invasive diagnostic evaluations, and consumes significant medical resources. Although most patients with acute LGIB stop bleeding spontaneously and have favorable outcomes, morbidity and mortality are increased in older patients and those with comorbid medical conditions. An individual with acute LGIB classically presents with the sudden onset of hematochezia (maroon or red blood passed per rectum), although in rare cases patients with bleeding from the cecum/right colon can present with melena (black, tarry stools), and hematochezia can be seen in patients with brisk upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). Approximately 15% of patients with presumed LGIB are ultimately found to have an upper GI source for their bleeding, and for the purposes of this guideline, we define LGIB as the onset of hematochezia originating from either the colon or the rectum.

### Does this patient have a severe upper gastrointestinal bleed? [^113u9Lat]. JAMA (2012). Excellent credibility.

Context

Emergency physicians must determine both the location and the severity of acute gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) to optimize the diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.

Objectives

To identify the historical features, symptoms, signs, bedside maneuvers, and basic laboratory test results that distinguish acute upper GIB (UGIB) from acute lower GIB (LGIB) and to risk stratify those patients with a UGIB least likely to have severe bleeding that necessitates an urgent intervention.

Data Sources

A structured search of MEDLINE (1966-September 2011) and reference lists from retrieved articles, review articles, and physical examination textbooks.

Study Selection

High-quality studies were included of adult patients who were either admitted with GIB or evaluated in emergency departments with bedside evaluations and/or routine laboratory tests, and studies that did not include endoscopic findings in prediction models. The initial search yielded 2628 citations, of which 8 were retained that tested methods of identifying a UGIB and 18 that identified methods of determining the severity of UGIB.

Data Extraction

One author abstracted the data (prevalence, sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios [LRs]) and assessed methodological quality, with confirmation by another author. Data were combined using random effects measures.

Data Synthesis

The majority of patients (N = 1776) had an acute UGIB (prevalence, 63%; 95% CI, 51%-73%). Several clinical factors increase the likelihood that a patient has a UGIB, including a patient-reported history of melena (LR range, 5.1–5.9), melenic stool on examination (LR, 25; 95% CI, 4–174), a nasogastric lavage with blood or coffee grounds (LR, 9.6; 95% CI, 4.0–23.0), and a serum urea nitrogen:creatinine ratio of more than 30 (summary LR, 7.5; 95% CI, 2.8–12.0). Conversely, the presence of blood clots in stool (LR, 0.05; 95% CI, 0.01–0.38) decreases the likelihood of a UGIB. Of the patients clinically diagnosed with acute UGIB, 36% (95% CI, 29%-44%) had severe bleeding. A nasogastric lavage with red blood (summary LR, 3.1; 95% CI, 1.2–14.0), tachycardia (LR, 4.9; 95% CI, 3.2–7.6), or a hemoglobin level of less than 8 g/dL (LR range, 4.5–6.2) increase the likelihood of a severe UGIB requiring urgent intervention. A Blatchford score of 0 (summary LR, 0.02; 95% CI, 0–0.05) decreases the likelihood that a UGIB requires urgent intervention.

Conclusions

Melena, nasogastric lavage with blood or coffee grounds, or serum urea nitrogen:creatinine ratio of more than 30 increase the likelihood of a UGIB. Blood clots in the stool make a UGIB much less likely. The Blatchford clinical prediction score, which does not require nasogastric lavage, is very efficient for identifying patients who do not require urgent intervention.

### Management of patients with ulcer bleeding [^114ZJw7s]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2012). Medium credibility.

ACG Practice Guidelines — Scope, evidence review, and grading — focus on ulcer-related UGIB and use GRADE for recommendations. Ulcers are the most common cause of hospitalization for UGIB, and this guideline addresses the management of patients with overt UGIB due to gastric or duodenal ulcers, where "overt" indicates hematemesis, melena, and/or hematochezia. The document covers initial assessment and risk stratification, pre-endoscopic use of medications and gastric lavage, timing of endoscopy, endoscopic and medical management, post-endoscopic medical therapy and disposition, and prevention of recurrent bleeding. Evidence review included a MEDLINE search using the MeSH term "gastrointestinal hemorrhage" limited to "all clinical trials" and "meta-analysis" for years 1966–2010 without language restriction. The GRADE system was used; the quality of evidence ranges from "high" to "very low" with stated definitions, and the strength of a recommendation is graded as strong when desirable effects clearly outweigh undesirable effects and conditional when uncertainty exists about the trade-offs; additional factors include variability in patient values and preferences and whether an intervention represents a wise use of resources.

### The role of endoscopy in the patient with lower GI bleeding [^116TAFWe]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2014). Medium credibility.

Regarding diagnostic procedures for lower gastrointestinal bleeding, more specifically with respect to upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, ASGE 2014 guidelines recommend to perform an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy in the initial evaluation of patients with melena.

### Management of patients with acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding: an updated ACG guideline [^114QVy2W]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Initial management — initial triage/evaluation emphasizes comprehensive bedside assessment: "A thorough history and physical examination is needed to determine potential sources of bleeding and help identify patients at risk of severe bleeding and adverse outcomes such as rebleeding and mortality". History should cover "cardiovascular, oncologic, or renal comorbidities; GI surgeries; and associated symptoms such as abdominal pain, alteration in bowel habits, or unintentional weight loss". Examination should include "careful attention to vital signs and assessment for signs of hypovolemia", and "Careful rectal examination can help determine whether a bleeding source may be emanating from the anorectal region or indicate the presence of melena, which may increase the likelihood of an UGIB". Medication review should assess "NSAIDs, antiplatelets, and anticoagulants", and "findings such as a preceding history of decompensated liver disease or prior peptic ulcer disease… or visible stigmata of advanced liver disease may indicate the possibility of an upper GI source of bleeding in a patient with severe hematochezia".

### Diagnostic studies… [^112jsswd]. AAFP (2013). Low credibility.

Gastrointestinal bleeding may be classified as overt, obscure, or occult. Overt GI bleeding is visible, such as hematemesis, hematochezia, or melena. 6 and Crohn disease. 5 In patients older than 40 years, vascular ectasias and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug–induced ulcers are the most common causes. However, celiac disease remains a possible cause in symptomatic 7 and asymptomatic 8 adults older than 50 years. Less common causes of occult GI bleeding include infections and long-distance running. Researchers hypothesize that long-distance running induces GI blood loss because of transient intestinal ischemia from decreased splanchnic perfusion during exercise.
9.

A family history of GI bleeding may suggest hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia or blue rubber bleb nevus syndrome. A history of gastric bypass surgery may suggest impaired iron absorption. 5 A history of liver disease or stigmata of liver disease suggests portal hypertensive gastropathy or colopathy. Other helpful physical examination findings that could indicate the presence of an underlying condition include dermatitis herpetiformis; erythema nodosum; an atrophic tongue and brittle, spoon-shaped nails; hyperextensible joints and ocular and dental abnormalities; and freckles on the lips and in the mouth.
4.

In eight studies of double-balloon enteroscopy in patients with obscure GI bleeding, the most common findings in the small bowel were vascular ectasias, ulcerations, and malignancies. However, colonic and upper GI tract lesions, including cancer, have been reported in this group. 26 Thus, premenopausal women who have iron deficiency anemia that cannot be explained by heavy menses, or those who have GI symptoms, should be evaluated for a GI cause. 4, 8, 10.

### Upper gastrointestinal bleeding in coronavirus disease 2019 patients [^114Np2w1]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) has significant morbidity and UGIB cases have been described in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. Management of this condition can be challenging considering both the possible severe COVID-19-related pneumonia as well as the risk of the virus spreading from patients to health operators. The aim of this paper is to review the most recent studies available in the literature in order to evaluate the actual incidence of UGIB, its clinical and endoscopic manifestations and its optimal management.

Recent Findings

UGIB has an incidence between 0.5% and 1.9% among COVID-19 patients, and it typically presents with melena or hematemesis. Peptic ulcers are the most common endoscopic findings. High Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), dialysis, acute kidney injury and advanced oncological disease increase the risk for UGIB. Although anticoagulants are commonly used in COVID-19 patients they are not associated with an increased incidence of UGIB. Conservative management is a common approach that results in similar outcomes compared to upper GI endoscopic treatment. Apparently, UGIB in COVID-19 seems not have a detrimental effect and only one study showed an increased mortality in those who developed UGIB during hospitalization.

Summary

Incidence of UGIB in COVID-19 patients is similar to that of the general population. Despite the widespread use of anticoagulants in these patients, they are not associated with an increased risk of UGIB. Conservative management could be an effective option, especially for patients that are at risk of intubation.

### Gastrointestinal bleeding at CT angiography and CT enterography: imaging atlas and glossary of terms [^114g26vg]. Radiographics (2021). Medium credibility.

Gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding is a common potentially life-threatening medical condition frequently requiring multidisciplinary collaboration to reach the proper diagnosis and guide management. GI bleeding can be overt (eg, visible hemorrhage such as hematemesis, hematochezia, or melena) or occult (eg, positive fecal occult blood test or iron deficiency anemia). Upper GI bleeding, which originates proximal to the ligament of Treitz, is more common than lower GI bleeding, which arises distal to the ligament of Treitz. Small bowel bleeding accounts for 5–10% of GI bleeding cases commonly manifesting as obscure GI bleeding, where the source remains unknown after complete GI tract endoscopic and imaging evaluation. CT can aid in identifying the location and cause of bleeding and is an important complementary tool to endoscopy, nuclear medicine, and angiography in evaluating patients with GI bleeding. For radiologists, interpreting CT scans in patients with GI bleeding can be challenging owing to the large number of images and the diverse potential causes of bleeding. The purpose of this pictorial review by the Society of Abdominal Radiology GI Bleeding Disease-Focused Panel is to provide a practical resource for radiologists interpreting GI bleeding CT studies that reviews the proper GI bleeding terminology, the most common causes of GI bleeding, key patient history and risk factors, the optimal CT imaging technique, and guidelines for case interpretation and illustrates many common causes of GI bleeding. A CT reporting template is included to help generate radiology reports that can add value to patient care. An invited commentary by Al Hawary is available online.

### Antiretroviral prophylaxis: a digestive complication to know [^115JWyWA]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

An 8-year-old child experienced abdominal pain and melena due to duodenal and ileal ulcerations throughout antiretroviral prophylactic treatment after a needlestick injury. Mild to moderate adverse effects often occur with lamivudine and zidovudine, but more severe adverse effects such as intestinal ulcers resulting in melena after a prophylactic antiretroviral treatment may question the safety of the current guidelines.

### Descriptive analysis of common causes of upper gastrointestinal bleeding in pediatric patients in kerman: a study from 2022 to 2023 [^114PPW1t]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Upon admission, hematological evaluation was prioritized, with initial full blood count analysis performed on all patients, underscoring the critical role of prompt assessment in suspected UGIB cases. The severity of bleeding, as indirectly assessed by hemoglobin (Hb) levels, demonstrated a correlation with the presenting symptoms.

Patients presenting with isolated hematemesis exhibited the highest mean Hb concentration at 10.7 g/dL, with a range spanning from 6.2 to 14.1 g/dL. This wide range suggests significant variability in the severity of blood loss among patients with this presentation.

In contrast, those presenting with isolated melena showed a lower mean Hb level of 9.1 g/dL (range: 5.7–13.2 g/dL). Notably, patients manifesting both hematemesis and melena demonstrated the lowest mean Hb concentration at 7.5 g/dL (range: 5.1–10.4 g/dL).

In addition to the primary presenting symptoms of hematemesis and melena, a constellation of associated clinical manifestations was observed in our patients with UGIB. The most prevalent concomitant symptom was abdominal pain, reported by 74.16% of the patients. This was closely followed by nausea, which affected 71.6% of the study population. General malaise or weakness was also a significant finding, present in 56.6% of the cases.

Transfusion therapy was initiated based on stringent clinical criteria, primarily focusing on significant Hb depletion (< 8 g/dL) coupled with signs of hemodynamic instability. This approach aligns with current best practices in pediatric transfusion medicine for UGIB.

The necessity for blood transfusion varied markedly among different presenting symptom groups. In the patients presenting with isolated hematemesis, 11 out of 69 patients (15.94%) required transfusion. This proportion increased substantially in patients manifesting both hematemesis and melena, with 24 out of 40 patients (60%) necessitating blood product support. Among patients presenting with isolated melena, 3 out of 11 (27.2%) met the criteria for transfusion.

### Peritonitis in patients with scrub typhus [^111bUzSu]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2012). Low credibility.

Various complications have been reported in scrub typhus cases including acute respiratory distress syndrome, encephalitis, pneumonia, pericarditis, acute renal failure, and acute hepatic failure. Few studies have reported on the gastrointestinal manifestations of scrub typhus. Typical gastrointestinal manifestations in patients with scrub typhus include abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, hematemesis, melena, and diarrhea. The two cases presented in this study are the first reported cases of peritonitis associated with scrub typhus. This study shows that scrub typhus should also be included in the differential diagnosis of peritonitis in areas where Orientia tsutsugamushi is endemic.

### Extramedullary relapse of multiple myeloma presenting as hematemesis and melena [^115dB41x]. Nature Clinical Practice: Oncology (2006). Medium credibility.

Background

A 60-year-old woman with multiple myeloma relapsed after a good partial response to high-dose chemotherapy (melphalan 200 mg/m(2)) and autologous stem-cell transplantation, followed by thalidomide and prednisolone maintenance therapy. She presented with hematemesis and melena following salvage chemotherapy with dexamethasone, cyclophosphamide, etoposide, cisplatin, and rescue therapy with single-agent bortezomib.

Investigations

Physical examination, laboratory investigations, gastroscopy, 2-[(18)F]fluoro-2-deoxyglucose-PET (FDG-PET), breast biopsy and histology.

Diagnosis

Multifocal extramedullary relapse of multiple myeloma involving the stomach and duodenum.

Management

High-dose infusion of omeprazole, blood product support, palliative analgesics and anxiolytic agents.

### Is coffee ground vomiting important? Findings from a large bleeding unit database and outcomes at 30 days [^116KhFYX]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

'Coffee ground' vomiting (CGV) has classically been considered a sign of upper gastrointestinal bleeding. There is a paucity of data concerning endoscopic findings and outcomes in patients presenting with CGV. The aim of this study was to analyze endoscopic yield and 30-day outcomes in CGV patients.

Methods

Analysis was performed over the period 1992–2005 and four groups were identified: CGV alone, hematemesis alone, melena alone, and hematemesis and melena. Endoscopic yield, requirement for blood transfusion, rebleeding, and mortality rate at 30days were calculated and compared using logistic regression analysis.

Results

6054 patients (mean age 61.3years, 3538 male) were included in the study. The hematemesis group was younger compared with the other groups. Therefore, endoscopic yield was adjusted for age and sex. CGV was associated with a significantly lower risk of gastric ulcer, duodenal ulcer, varices, gastric cancer, esophageal cancer, and Mallory-Weiss tears compared with some or all of the other groups. CGV was associated with an increased risk of esophagitis and no source was found. CGV was associated with a lower rate of blood transfusion and rebleeding (all P < 0.0001) but 30-day mortality rates were similar. CGV was less likely to require endoscopic intervention compared with the other groups (all P < 0.001).

Conclusions

CGV is associated with a lower endoscopic yield, requirement for blood transfusion, rebleeding rate, and potential for intervention compared to those with hematemesis, melena or both. Mortality rates are similar suggesting a nonbleeding cause and therefore questions the role of endoscopy in CGV.

### Meloxicam [^115nku1S]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.2 Gastrointestinal Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation

NSAIDs, including meloxicam, can cause serious gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events including inflammation, bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, or large intestine, which can be fatal. These serious adverse events can occur at any time, with or without warning symptoms, in patients treated with NSAIDs. Only one in five patients who develop a serious upper GI adverse event on NSAID therapy is symptomatic. Upper GI ulcers, gross bleeding, or perforation caused by NSAIDs occurred in approximately 1% of patients treated for 3–6 months, and in about 2–4% of patients treated for one year. However, even short-term NSAID therapy is not without risk.

Risk Factors for GI Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation

Patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or GI bleeding who used NSAIDs had a greater than 10-fold increased risk for developing a GI bleed compared to patients without these risk factors. Other factors that increase the risk of GI bleeding in patients treated with NSAIDs include longer duration of NSAID therapy; concomitant use of oral corticosteroids, aspirin, anticoagulants, or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs); smoking; use of alcohol; older age; and poor general health status. Most postmarketing reports of fatal GI events occurred in elderly or debilitated patients. Additionally, patients with advanced liver disease and/or coagulopathy are at increased risk for GI bleeding.

Strategies to Minimize the GI Risks in NSAID-treated patients:

Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest possible duration.
Avoid administration of more than one NSAID at a time.
Avoid use in patients at higher risk unless benefits are expected to outweigh the increased risk of bleeding. For such patients, as well as those with active GI bleeding, consider alternate therapies other than NSAIDs.
Remain alert for signs and symptoms of GI ulceration and bleeding during NSAID therapy.
If a serious GI adverse event is suspected, promptly initiate evaluation and treatment, and discontinue Meloxicam until a serious GI adverse event is ruled out.
In the setting of concomitant use of low-dose aspirin for cardiac prophylaxis, monitor patients more closely for evidence of GI bleeding [see Drug Interactions (7)].

### Evolution of mortality rates due to gastrointestinal bleeding in Peru and its geographic areas, 2003–2022 [^116U5KRc]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) is a clinical condition that is anatomically classified as upper or lower, depending on the origin of the bleeding relative to the ligament of Treitz. Upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) refers to bleeding proximal to the ligament of Treitz. It is further categorized as variceal or non-variceal, with the latter being the most common cause. Clinically, UGIB typically presents with hematemesis and, in some cases, melena, depending on the volume and rate of bleeding, which may compromise hemodynamic stability. In contrast, lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB) originates distal to the ligament of Treitz, with diverticular disease being its most frequent cause.

UGIB is one of the leading causes of emergency admissions in gastroenterology services worldwide. It generates high hospital demand, prolonged stays, and a significant increase in healthcare costs, making it a major public health concern. Globally, the incidence of UGIB ranges from 15 to 172 cases per 100,000 population, with an estimated mortality with rates ranging from 0.9 to 9.8 per 100,000. LGIB has an approximate incidence of 20.5 to 87 cases per 100,000 population, and a mortality rate ranging between 0.8 and 3.5 per 100,000 population. In Peru, approximately 1,030 deaths from GIB were reported in 2021, equivalent to a mortality rate of 3.3 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants. Although a decline in GIB-related mortality has been observed in recent decades, there is still no comprehensive study assessing GIB mortality across Peru's different geographic regions.

### Nasogastric aspiration and lavage in emergency department patients with hematochezia or melena without hematemesis [^111KWV8N]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Objectives

The utility of nasogastric aspiration and lavage in the emergency management of patients with melena or hematochezia without hematemesis is controversial. This evidence-based emergency medicine review evaluates the following question: does nasogastric aspiration and lavage in patients with melena or hematochezia and no hematemesis differentiate an upper from lower source of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding?

Methods

MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, and other databases were searched. Studies were selected for inclusion in the review if the authors had performed nasogastric aspiration (with or without lavage) in all patients with hematochezia or melena and performed esophagogastroduodenal endoscopy (EGD) in all patients. Studies were excluded if they enrolled patients with history of esophageal varices or included patients with hematemesis or coffee ground emesis (unless the data for patients without hematemesis or coffee ground emesis could be separated out). The outcome was identifying upper GI hemorrhage (active bleeding or high-risk lesions potentially responsible for hemorrhage) and the rate of complications associated with the nasogastric tube insertion. Quality of the included studies was assessed using standard criteria for diagnostic accuracy studies.

Results

Three retrospective studies met our inclusion and exclusion criteria. The prevalence of an upper GI source for patients with melena or hematochezia without hematemesis was 32% to 74%. According to the included studies, the diagnostic performance of the nasogastric aspiration and lavage for predicting upper GI bleeding is poor. The sensitivity of this test ranged from 42% to 84%, the specificity from 54% to 91%, and negative likelihood ratios from 0.62 to 0.20. Only one study reported the rate complications associated with nasogastric aspiration and lavage (1.6%).

Conclusions

Nasogastric aspiration, with or without lavage, has a low sensitivity and poor negative likelihood ratio, which limits its utility in ruling out an upper GI source of bleeding in patients with melena or hematochezia without hematemesis.

### Analysis of the causes and clinical characteristics of jejunoileal hemorrhage in China: a multicenter 10 year retrospective survey [^111FfWzT]. BMC Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

Conclusions

The results of this study clearly show a more update view of the the causes, diagnostic methods and clinical features of jejunoileal hemorrhage in China. Tumor, enteritis and angiopathy and diverticular disease are the most common causes of jejunoileal hemorrhage in Shandong province, China. The main clinical manifestations are bloody stools, most commonly in the form of melena, with or without abdominal pain. We recommend that female patients over the age of 40 with jejunoileal hemorrhage accompanied by abdominal pain should undergo urgent further assessment because of the strong probability of jejunoileal tumor. For male patients with copious jejunoileal bleeding that is not accompanied by abdominal pain, we suggest that the diagnosis of angiopathy should be considered after jejunoileal tumor has been excluded. Laparotomy is the main treatment method, based on the data that indicate that the main cause is tumor.

### Gastrointestinal bleeding in children: current management, controversies, and advances [^11137UiV]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

Upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) in children has many causes, with its prevalence varying by age. Often presenting as hematemesis or melena, the initial treatment is stabilization of the patient, including protection of the airway, fluid resuscitation, and a transfusion hemoglobin threshold of 7 g/L. Endoscopy should be performed with the goal of using combinations of therapies to treat a bleeding lesion, generally involving epinephrine injection along with either cautery, hemoclips, or hemospray. This review discusses the diagnosis and treatment of variceal and non-variceal gastrointestinal bleeding in children with a focus on current advances in the treatment of severe UGIB.

### Upper gastrointestinal bleeding in adults: evaluation and management [^1127G6rW]. American Family Physician (2020). Medium credibility.

Upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding is defined as hemorrhage from the mouth to the ligament of Treitz. Common risk factors for upper GI bleeding include prior upper GI bleeding, anticoagulant use, high-dose nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use, and older age. Causes of upper GI bleeding include peptic ulcer bleeding, gastritis, esophagitis, variceal bleeding, Mallory-Weiss syndrome, and cancer. Signs and symptoms of upper GI bleeding may include abdominal pain, lightheadedness, dizziness, syncope, hematemesis, and melena. Physical examination includes assessment of hemodynamic stability, presence of abdominal pain or rebound tenderness, and examination of stool color. Laboratory tests should include a complete blood count, basic metabolic panel, coagulation panel, liver tests, and type and crossmatch. A bolus of normal saline or lactated Ringer solution should be rapidly infused to correct hypovolemia and to maintain blood pressure, and blood should be transfused when hemoglobin is less than 7 g per dL. Clinical prediction guides (e.g. Glasgow-Blatchford bleeding score) are necessary for upper GI bleeding risk stratification and to determine therapy. Patients with hemodynamic instability and signs of upper GI bleeding should be offered urgent endoscopy, performed within 24 hours of presentation. A common strategy in patients with failed endoscopic hemostasis is to attempt transcatheter arterial embolization, then proceed to surgery if hemostasis is not obtained. Proton pump inhibitors should be initiated upon presentation with upper GI bleeding. Guidelines recommend high-dose proton pump inhibitor treatment for the first 72 hours post-endoscopy because this is when rebleeding risk is highest. Deciding when to restart antithrombotic therapy after upper GI bleeding is difficult because of lack of sufficient data.

### Systematic review with meta-analysis: age-related malignancy detection rates at upper gastrointestinal endoscopy [^112dPJ6F]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Materials and methods

For this systematic review and meta-analysis, we adopted the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis 2009 guideline. The study protocol is registered in PROSPERO, (CRD42018100060). Study selection, data extraction, and quality assessment were independently performed by JJJ and IMET and discrepancies resolved through discussion with MAL. This study was exempted from Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval.

Search strategy and study selection

The electronic databases MEDLINE (US National Library of Medicine, 1946–2018), EMBASE (Elsevier, 1974–2018), and Web of Science (Clarivate analytics, 1900–2018) were searched to select eligible studies in November 2018 by JJdeJ and IMET. Terms for 'upper gastrointestinal endoscopy', 'upper gastrointestinal malignancy', and 'upper gastrointestinal symptoms' were combined with set operator 'AND'. No limits were applied. Reference lists were scanned for additional studies.

Studies reporting findings of upper GI endoscopy in adults (⩾18 years) were selected for full-text review. Study selection and inclusion and exclusion criteria are presented in Figure 1. We limited our selection to studies published in the year 2000 or thereafter to improve representativeness of results. We defined 'symptomatic' as any symptom with a potential origin in the upper GI tract, as opposed to a screening (i.e. asymptomatic) population. Alarm symptoms comprised one the following symptoms; (a) dysphagia; (b) signs of potential upper GI blood loss (hematemesis, melena, anemia, hematochezia); (c) unintentional weight loss; (d) persistent vomiting. We considered conference abstracts for inclusion if data for primary and secondary outcomes were available. If identical populations were reported in multiple studies, we included the most recent study.

Figure 1.
Flow diagram of study selection.

Data extraction

Data were recorded in prespecified data extraction forms. We extracted data on authorship, country, period, design of study, sample size, percentage male, type of symptoms, number of patients with malignancy (gastric versus esophageal), and patient's age at diagnosis of malignancy. If numbers of malignancies were presented in bar charts without textual presentation, we estimated numbers with highest possible precision.

### ACG clinical guideline: diagnosis and management of small bowel bleeding [^116cb1iY]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2015). Medium credibility.

Diagnosis of small bowel bleeding recommendations — Second-look upper endoscopy should be considered in cases of recurrent hematemesis, melena, or a previously incomplete exam (strong recommendation, low level of evidence); second-look colonoscopy should be considered in the setting of recurrent hematochezia or if a lower source is suspected (conditional recommendation, very low level of evidence); if the second-look examinations are normal, the next step should be a small bowel evaluation (strong recommendation, moderate level of evidence); push enteroscopy can be performed as a second-look examination in the evaluation of suspected small bowel bleeding (conditional recommendation, moderate level of evidence); video capsule endoscopy (VCE) should be considered a first-line procedure for small bowel (SB) evaluation after upper and lower GI sources have been excluded, including second-look endoscopy when indicated (strong recommendation, moderate level of evidence); owing to the lower detection rate of lesions in the duodenum and proximal jejunum with VCE, push enteroscopy should be performed if proximal lesions are suspected (strong recommendation, very low level of evidence); total deep enteroscopy should be attempted if there is a strong suspicion of a small bowel lesion based on clinical presentation or abnormal VCE study (strong recommendation, moderate level of evidence); any method of deep enteroscopy can be used when endoscopic evaluation and therapy is required based on similar diagnostic yields (strong recommendation, high level of evidence); intraoperative enteroscopy (IOE) is a highly sensitive but invasive diagnostic and effective therapeutic procedure and its usage should be limited to scenarios where enteroscopy cannot be performed (strong recommendation, low level of evidence); VCE should be performed before deep enteroscopy to increase diagnostic yield, and initial deep enteroscopy can be considered in cases of massive hemorrhage or when VCE is contraindicated (strong recommendation, high level of evidence).

### Effect of acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding manifestations at admission on the in-hospital outcomes of liver cirrhosis: hematemesis versus melena without hematemesis [^113YJaoq]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Patients with acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding (AUGIB) often manifest as hematemesis and melena. Theoretically, hematemesis will carry worse outcomes of AUGIB. However, there is little real-world evidence. We aimed to compare the outcomes of hematemesis versus no hematemesis as a clinical manifestation of AUGIB at admission in cirrhotic patients.

Methods

All cirrhotic patients with AUGIB who were consecutively admitted to our hospital from January 2010 to June 2014 were considered in this retrospective study. Patients were divided into hematemesis with or without melena and melena alone without hematemesis at admission. A 1:1 propensity score matching analysis was performed. Subgroup analyses were performed based on systemic hemodynamics (stable and unstable) and Child-Pugh class (A and B+C). Sensitivity analyses were conducted in patients with moderate and severe esophageal varices confirmed on endoscopy. Primary outcomes included five-day rebleeding and in-hospital death.

Results

Overall, 793 patients were included. Patients with hematemesis at admission had significantly higher five-day rebleeding rate (17.4 versus 10.1%, P = 0.004) and in-hospital mortality (7.9 versus 2.4%, P = 0.001) than those without hematemesis. In the propensity score matching analyses, 358 patients were included with similar Child-Pugh score (P = 0.227) and MELD score (P = 0.881) between the two groups; five-day rebleeding rate (19.0 versus 10.6%, P = 0.026) and in-hospital mortality (8.4 versus 2.8%, P = 0.021) remained significantly higher in patients with hematemesis. In the subgroup and sensitivity analyses, the statistical results were also similar.

Conclusions

Hematemesis at admission indicates worse outcomes of cirrhotic patients with AUGIB, which is useful for the risk stratification of AUGIB.

### Diagnostic value of the urea-to-creatinine ratio for gastrointestinal bleeding source: influence of renal function [^117QkxCE]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding is a common cause of hospital admissions, accounting for approximately 1–2% of cases and ranking among the top ten causes of urgent GI-related admissions in developed countries. Clinical presentation varies depending on the bleeding's severity and location: upper GI bleeding typically manifests as melena or hematemesis, while lower GI bleeding often presents with hematochezia. However, overlap in symptoms is frequent. Importantly, upper GI bleeding is often more severe and associated with hemodynamic instability. Still, lower GI bleeding can also be life-threatening, particularly in elderly patients with multiple comorbidities. History-taking, physical examination, and assessment of vital signs, as well as laboratory testing form the cornerstone of the diagnostic workup of suspected GI bleeding. Severity and extent of bleeding depend on various factors, including coagulation status, blood count, renal function, and volume status, and determine the necessity for transfusion of blood and coagulation products. In fact, differentiation of upper and lower GI bleeding is clinically relevant since the outcome differs significantly. While endoscopy remains the gold standard for localizing bleeding, it is not always immediately available. As a potential aid, the urea-to-creatinine ratio (UCR) has been proposed, with higher values suggesting upper GI bleeding. This may result from an increased digestion of hemoglobin in the upper GI tract and/or accumulation of urea resulting from renal hypoperfusion. It remains unclear, however, whether UCR is also applicable in patients with impaired kidney function. We therefore aimed to assess the effect of AKI and/or CKD on the UCR and its impact on predicting the localization of GI bleeding. This may be particularly of interest in severe renal hypoperfusion due to GI bleeding, which can in turn lead to prerenal AKI. An increase in UCR might occur independently of the location of the GI bleeding, solely due to increased urea reabsorption in the kidney.

Dengue critical phase — timing and key clinical features are described. The critical phase begins at defervescence and typically lasts 24–48 hours, and severe dengue manifestations are most frequently seen during this phase. Substantial plasma leakage can cause ascites or pleural effusions, hemoconcentration, and hypoproteinemia. Compensatory mechanisms narrow pulse pressure as diastolic blood pressure increases, initially maintaining adequate circulation; once hypotension develops, systolic blood pressure rapidly declines and irreversible shock and death can ensue despite resuscitation. Prolonged shock can lead to severe hemorrhagic manifestations including hematemesis, melena, or menorrhagia, and uncommon manifestations include encephalitis, hepatitis, myocarditis, or pancreatitis. Laboratory findings commonly include leukopenia, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, elevated aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase, hyponatremia, and a normal erythrocyte sedimentation rate.

### ACG clinical guideline: management of irritable bowel syndrome [^116YLShv]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) — colonoscopy use is addressed with a conditional recommendation stating, "We recommend against routine colonoscopy in patients with IBS symptoms younger than 45 years without warning signs" and "Conditional recommendation; low quality of evidence". Alarm features guiding decisions are listed as "hematochezia, melena, unintentional weight loss, older age of onset of symptoms, family history of IBD, colon cancer, or other significant GI disease". Supporting data note that "polyps were found in only 7.7% of patients with IBS compared with 26.1% in non-IBS patients (P < 0.0001)", and in a study "of 559 subjects who met Rome III IBS criteria" even "among the 136 subjects with no alarm features, Crohn's disease was found in 7.4% of subjects and celiac in 2.9%". The guideline summarizes that "in the absence of alarm features, there seems to be no justification for routine colonoscopy in subjects with IBS younger than 45 years", and further that "in patients older than 45 years, a recent negative colonoscopy for colon cancer screening or for other investigative purposes should mitigate the need for another colonoscopy for IBS symptoms in the absence of new alarm features" and that "the colonoscopy should be based on the age of the person and considered independent of IBS symptoms". For suspected microscopic colitis, colonoscopy "may be a special case among women older than 60 years" and "in patients considered to be at high risk of microscopic colitis (older age (> 60), female gender, and more intense diarrhea), there may be mounting evidence to support the use of colonoscopy".

### Upper gastrointestinal bleeding differences between older and younger adults: should bleeding in non-cirrhotic patients be considered a geriatric syndrome? [^114Gow8N]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Results

A total of 600 patients were included during the 6-month enrollment period. Patients were aged from 18 to 100 years, with a mean age of 72 ± 16 years. 72.8% (n = 437) of all patients were older than 64 years, and 58.2% (n = 349) were male.

Smoking habits and alcohol consumption were significantly higher in younger patients, as well as the diagnosis of cirrhosis. Other comorbidities such as CHF, diabetes mellitus, and CCI were more frequent/higher in the older patients. The intake of antiplatelets and anticoagulants was more common in the elderly. No other differences were found regarding medication at admission.

Table 1 presents the demographic and clinical characteristics of both study groups.

Table 1.
Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics.

The most frequent clinical presentation differed between the two groups: melena was more common in the older group, and hematemesis was more common in the younger group.

The causes of UGIB differed between the two groups, with variceal GIB significantly more frequent in the younger group and non-variceal GIB more common in the older group. PUD was the most common cause of UGI in both cohorts, with prevalence rates of 34.3% and 35.5%, respectively. The subsequent most prevalent diagnoses were angiodysplasia, erosive gastroduodenitis, and variceal bleeding. Angiodysplasia was predominantly observed in the elderly population. In patients with chronic liver disease, variceal bleeding emerged as the predominant cause of UGIB (n = 43, 43.9%), followed by PUD (n = 18, 18.4%).

In general, risk assessment scores were not widely used in all patients. Overall, the GBS and Complete RS were available for 85.5% and 81.8%, respectively. The RS and the GBS were higher in the older group, with a higher risk of adverse outcomes. Bleeding episode characteristics upon presentation, according to age group, are summarized in Table 2.

### Diagnosis and management of acute esophageal necrosis [^111VhpvJ]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Acute esophageal necrosis is a rare syndrome classically characterized by a striking endoscopic image of diffuse and circumferential black mucosal discoloration of distal esophagus, with an abrupt transition at the gastroesophageal junction and variable proximal extension. The typical patient is an older male with general debilitation and multiple comorbidities presenting with hematemesis or melena. The pathophysiology usually involves a combination of esophageal ischemia, backflow injury from gastric chemical contents and impaired mucosal reparative mechanisms associated with debilitated physical states. It may arise in the setting of hemodynamic compromise, diabetic ketoacidosis, hypothermia, alcoholic intoxication, trauma, inflammatory diseases, esophageal local infection, solid organ transplantation, postoperative status, drugs or acute gastric outlet obstruction, usually in the background of a chronic debilitating process, where the concurrent presence of multiple risk factors, including diabetes mellitus, hypertension, malnutrition, malignancy or alcohol abuse, places a patient at higher risk. The characteristic endoscopic appearance establishes the diagnosis. Biopsy is supportive but not required. Management is mainly supportive and consists of correcting coexisting conditions, fluid therapy, bowel rest, intravenous proton pump inhibitor therapy and red blood cell transfusion as needed. Although this is a serious life-threatening condition, appropriate treatment may result in a favorable outcome in the majority of patients.

### ACG clinical guideline: diagnosis and management of small bowel bleeding [^111bPMFm]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2015). Medium credibility.

ACG Clinical Guideline — definitions and classification of small bowel bleeding specify that a source of small bowel bleeding should be considered in patients with overt or occult GI hemorrhage after performance of a normal upper and lower endoscopic examination. Patients should be classified as having small bowel bleeding if a source of bleeding is identified distal to the ampulla of Vater and/or proximal to the ileocecal valve. After normal upper and lower endoscopic examinations and before performance of capsule endoscopy, patients should be classified as having "potential small bowel bleeding". "Overt small bowel bleeding" refers to patients presenting with either melena or hematochezia with a source of bleeding identified in the small intestine, and the term "occult small bowel bleeding" can be reserved for patients presenting with iron-deficiency anemia with or without guaiac-positive stools who are found to have a small bowel source of bleeding. The term "obscure GI bleeding" should be reserved for patients not found to have a source of bleeding after performance of standard upper and lower endoscopic examinations, small bowel evaluation with VCE and/or enteroscopy, and radiographic testing.

The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

GUIDELINE STATEMENTS

Management of antithrombotic agents in the setting of acute GI bleeding

The first 10 guideline statements address the management of antithrombotic agents in the setting of acute GI bleeding. Acute GI bleeding is defined as patients hospitalized or under observation with acute overt GI bleeding (upper and/or lower) manifesting as melena, hematochezia, or hematemesis. Life-threatening hemorrhage is defined as major clinically overt or apparent bleeding, resulting in hypovolemic shock or severe hypotension requiring pressors or surgery; or associated with a decrease in hemoglobin of > 5 g/dL, or requiring transfusion of ≥ 5 units of packed red blood cells, or causing death.

VKA reversal.

For patients on warfarin who are hospitalized or under observation with acute GI bleeding, we suggest against fresh frozen plasma (FFP) administration (conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence).

### Beyond the boundaries-endometriosis: typical and atypical locations [^117Av5mb]. Current Problems in Diagnostic Radiology (2011). Low credibility.

Endometriosis is characterized by the presence of endometrial glands and stroma in an ectopic location outside the endometrial cavity. This condition affects women during their reproductive years. Ovaries are by far the commonest location of endometriosis and have peculiar imaging features. However, the imaging diagnosis of extraovarian endometriosis is difficult to make both clinically and radiologically. The purpose of this article is to review the imaging features of endometriosis at typical and atypical sites on different modalities and to describe the commonly encountered complications. Atypical sites for endometriosis include the gastrointestinal tract, urinary tract, soft tissues, and chest. Depending on the site, they can present with varied symptoms, including bowel obstruction, melena, hematuria, dysuria, dyspnea, and swelling in the soft tissues, respectively. The endometriotic implant in the extraovarian location is a challenging diagnosis. It is important to be aware of the sites, radiologic appearances, and complications of ovarian and extraovarian endometriosis while evaluating a woman in the reproductive age group with appropriate symptomatology. Endometriosis at extraovarian locations is a challenging diagnosis clinically and radiologically. Clinical symptomatology with characteristic imaging features in the appropriate patient population is helpful in reaching the diagnosis. Precise diagnosis regarding presence, location, and extent of endometriosis is useful for preoperative evaluation and surgical planning of endometriosis.

In conclusion, when GPA patients suffer from abdominal pain, diarrhea, bloody stools, or melena, the differential diagnosis should be made while taking into account the possibility of granulomatous vasculitis involving the gastrointestinal tract. Colonoscopy combined with tissue biopsy can help to determine the nature of the disease, and provide an effective method for differential diagnosis.

### ACG clinical guideline: diagnosis and management of small bowel bleeding [^111nTKsT]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2015). Medium credibility.

ACG Clinical Guideline — Diagnosis of small bowel bleeding initial endoscopic evaluation states that second-look upper endoscopy should be considered in cases of recurrent hematemesis, melena, or a previously incomplete exam, and second-look colonoscopy should be considered in the setting of recurrent hematochezia or if a lower source is suspected. If the second-look examinations are normal, the next step should be a small bowel evaluation. Push enteroscopy can be performed as a second-look examination in the evaluation of suspected small bowel bleeding. Video capsule endoscopy (VCE) should be considered as a first-line procedure for SB evaluation after upper and lower GI sources have been excluded, including second-look endoscopy when indicated. Owing to the lower detection rate of lesions in the duodenum and proximal jejunum with VCE, push enteroscopy should be performed if proximal lesions are suspected.

Risk of bias assessment

Since this is a narrative account with no statistical analyses conducted, and most studies on the topic are retrospective in nature, risk of bias was not assessed.

Figure 1 and online supplemental figure 1 show the overall article selection flow chart as well as a breakdown by organ toxicity, respectively. A total of 8672 articles were included in the initial screening, with 166 articles included in the final review.

Luminal GI adverse events

Upper GI toxicity (esophagitis, gastroenteritis)

Esophagitis/gastroenteritis

Gastric and esophageal inflammation due to ICIs are relatively rare toxicities that occur in around 3%–5.4% of patients on immunotherapy. The inflammation can extend to neighboring structures, with up to 45% of patients having duodenal involvement and up to 70% of cases having concurrent enterocolitis. This is more common in the presence of risk factors such as previous non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug use (the impact of dose and temporality of which have yet to be studied) and concurrent chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Esophageal inflammation typically presents with relatively mild symptoms such as nausea and vomiting that may be accompanied by dysphagia or odynophagia, hematemesis, dyspepsia, and melena. Symptoms of gastric and enteric inflammation include anorexia with weight loss, dyspepsia, nausea and vomiting, early satiety, bloating, melena, and rarely, iron-deficiency anemia. Abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea may be present in cases with concurrent colitis. Clinical symptom severity can be gaged via the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) grading of the overall esophagitis or gastritis. Alternatively, the CTCAE severity of individual symptoms can also be used. In patients with gastric malignancy (be it a primary or metastatic lesion), the antitumor response induced by ICIs may mimic gastroenteritis symptoms or even cause gastric perforation.

Information for Patients

Patients should be informed of the following information before initiating therapy with an NSAID and periodically during the course of ongoing therapy. Patients should also be encouraged to read the NSAID Medication Guide that accompanies each prescription dispensed.

1. Naproxen Sodium Tablets, USP, like other NSAIDs, may cause serious CV side effects, such as MI or stroke, which may result in hospitalization and even death. Although serious CV events can occur without warning symptoms, patients should be alert for the signs and symptoms of chest pain, shortness of breath, weakness, slurring of speech, and should ask for medical advice when observing any indicative sign or symptoms. Patients should be apprised of the importance of this follow-up (see WARNINGS: Cardiovascular Effects).

2. Naproxen Sodium Tablets, USP, like other NSAIDs, can cause GI discomfort and, rarely, serious GI side effects, such as ulcers and bleeding, which may result in hospitalization and even death. Although serious GI tract ulcerations and bleeding can occur without warning symptoms, patients should be alert for the signs and symptoms of ulcerations and bleeding, and should ask for medical advice when observing any indicative signs or symptoms including epigastric pain, dyspepsia, melena, and hematemesis. Patients should be apprised of the importance of this follow-up (see WARNINGS: Gastrointestinal Effects- Risk of Ulceration, Bleeding, and Perforation).

### Timing of endoscopy in cirrhotic patients with acute variceal bleeding: protocol of a multicenter randomized controlled trial [^116xGCKY]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Diagnosis and definitions

AUGIB is defined as hematemesis and/or melena occurring within 5 days prior to the admission. Hematemesis is characterized as patients vomiting fresh red blood or coffee-ground-like contents. Melena is characterized as patients having black tarry stools or brown feces. Sometimes, patients with AUGIB also present with hematochezia.

The highly suspected diagnosis of variceal bleeding would be primarily dependent on the history of liver cirrhosis and clinical and imaging characteristics of portal hypertension.

Variceal bleeding would be diagnosed, if any one of the following conditions was met: (1) active bleeding from esophageal or gastric varices under endoscopy, (2) white thrombus on the surface of varices, suggesting recent variceal bleeding; or (3) only varices in the esophagus or stomach without any other sources of bleeding.

Non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding is characterized as gastrointestinal bleeding located above the Treitz ligament is caused by non-variceal sources, primarily including peptic ulcer, upper gastrointestinal tumors, stress ulcer, acute gastrointestinal mucosal damage, Mallory–Weiss syndrome, upper gastrointestinal vascular malformations, Dieulafoy's lesions, periampullary tumors, pancreatic tumors, and bile duct tumors.

Failure to control bleeding is defined as any one of the four following conditions within 5 days of admission: (1) vomiting of fresh blood; (2) suction of more than 100 mL of fresh blood from the nasogastric tube; (3) a decrease in hemoglobin concentration of 30 g/L in the absence of blood transfusion; or (4) death.

Rebleeding is defined as a new onset of hematemesis or melena after successful treatment, and/or a decrease in hemoglobin concentration of 30 g/L in the absence of blood transfusion, and/or development of hypovolemic shock.

### Analysis of the causes and clinical characteristics of jejunoileal hemorrhage in China: a multicenter 10 year retrospective survey [^113mB8gT]. BMC Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

A retrospective study was performed to assess the causes, diagnostic methods for, and clinical features of, jejunoileal hemorrhage in Shandong province, China and to derive recommendations for management of this condition from these data.

Methods

We performed a retrospective systematic collection of data from between January 1999 and December 2008 in seven cities in Shandong province, China, identified 72 patients with jejunoileal hemorrhage and analyzed the relevant clinical data.

Results

Overall, tumors were the most common cause of jejunoileal hemorrhage (42 patients, 58.3%). The causes of this condition were significantly different (P < 0.05) in male and female patients. In male patients, the commonest factors were tumor (52.2%), enteritis (17.4%) and angiopathy (15.2%). However, in female patients, tumors accounted for a greater proportion of cases (18/26, 69.2%). In 38 cases (52.8%) the diagnosis was made by intraoperative enteroscopy or laparotomy, in 14 by capsule endoscopy and in the remainder by radiological methods. The most frequent presentation was melena (62.7%), followed by maroon stools (26.9%) and hematochezia (9.0%). Of the 72 patients, laparotomy is the main treatment method.

Conclusion

Tumor, enteritis and angiopathy and diverticular disease are the most common causes of jejunoileal hemorrhage in Shandong province, China. The main clinical manifestations are bloody stools, most commonly in the form of melena, with or without abdominal pain. We recommend that female patients over the age of 40 with jejunoileal hemorrhage accompanied by abdominal pain should undergo urgent further assessment because of the strong probability of jejunoileal tumor.

### The role of endoscopy in the patient with lower GI bleeding [^113b5PuD]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2014). Medium credibility.

Lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB) definitions and classification — LGIB historically has been defined as bleeding that emanates from a source distal to the ligament of Treitz, but after the advent of deep enteroscopy small-bowel sources have been placed in the category of midgut bleeding and a new definition of LGIB has been proposed as bleeding from a source distal to the ileocecal valve; acute LGIB is defined as bleeding of recent duration (< 3 days) that may result in hemodynamic instability, anemia, and/or the need for blood transfusion; chronic LGIB is the passage of blood per rectum over a period of several days or longer and usually implies intermittent or slow loss of blood, and patients with chronic LGIB present with occult fecal blood, intermittent melena or maroon stools, or scant amounts of bright red blood per rectum.

### Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever in man, republic of Georgia, 2009 [^115ZD3zF]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

The National Center for Disease Control and Public Health also conducted environmental sampling as part of their case investigation. Rodent brain and lung tissue homogenates were collected from 2 mice captured in the backyard of the patient. Samples were tested by using an antigen detection kit (#97, D-1154; Vector-Best) to confirm the diagnosis. Optical density values were 0.833 and 0.890, respectively (cutoff value 0.334).

This case has serious public health implications for Georgia. For example, laboratory capability to safely detect this virus should be evaluated. Also, healthcare personnel should receive additional education about this disease, particularly so that appropriate precautions can be implemented during initial evaluations. The case was typical of CCHF and showed the pattern of prehemorrhagic, hemorrhagic, and convalescent phases. Hematemesis, melena, and somnolence have been predictors of death in previous investigations. Frequency of patients with asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic disease should also be determined. Recognition and testing of mild-to-moderate cases may also increase in Georgia as a result of increased awareness in the healthcare community.

### Appropriate use of GI endoscopy [^115tauw3]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2012). Medium credibility.

Colonoscopy is generally indicated for evaluation of an abnormality on barium enema or other imaging study that is likely to be clinically significant, evaluation of unexplained GI bleeding (hematochezia; melena after an upper GI source has been excluded; presence of fecal occult blood), unexplained iron deficiency anemia, and screening and surveillance for colonic neoplasia including screening of asymptomatic, average-risk patients, examination to evaluate the entire colon for synchronous cancer or neoplastic polyps in a patient with treatable cancer or neoplastic polyp, colonoscopy to remove synchronous neoplastic lesions at or around the time of curative resection of cancer followed by colonoscopy at 1 year and, if normal, then 3 years, and, if normal, then 5 years thereafter to detect metachronous cancer, surveillance of patients with neoplastic polyps, and surveillance of patients with a significant family history of colorectal neoplasia; additional indications include dysplasia and cancer surveillance in select patients with long-standing ulcerative or Crohn's colitis, evaluation of patients with chronic inflammatory bowel disease of the colon if more precise diagnosis or determination of the extent of activity of disease will influence management, and clinically significant diarrhea of unexplained origin.

### Case report: extensive gangrene: a rare presentation of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children [^111x4wnX]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2022). Medium credibility.

Our patient had melena prior to admission, which can be a result of thrombocytopenia, stress-induced gastric ulcers, or gut involvement as a part of systemic hyperinflammation and angiopathy. There was no significant coagulopathy at admission. Children with TOF can have thromboembolic events in the gut that cause ischemia. The most common gastrointestinal complications reported are necrotizing enterocolitis and paralytic ileus, which are noted most commonly after surgical intervention. Spontaneous gut ischemia with or without acute illness is not seen often in TOF. We did not perform endoscopy to look for the cause of melena because there was no recurrence. It could have responded to antacids, improvements in platelet count, or immunomodulation.

To conclude, we report a case of unoperated TOF with MIS with retiform purpura with extensive gangrene involving the acral areas and ears in a young boy who improved, with residual deformity.

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide) that accompanies each prescription dispensed. Patients, families, or their caregivers should be informed of the following information before initiating therapy with VIVLODEX and periodically during the course of ongoing therapy.

Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events

Advise patients to be alert for the symptoms of cardiovascular thrombotic events, including chest pain, shortness of breath, weakness, or slurring of speech, and to report any of these symptoms to their health care provider immediately [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Gastrointestinal Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation

Advise patients to report symptoms of ulcerations and bleeding, including epigastric pain, dyspepsia, melena, and hematemesis to their health care provider. In the setting of concomitant use of low-dose aspirin for cardiac prophylaxis, inform patients of the increased risk for and the signs and symptoms of GI bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Hepatotoxicity

Inform patients of the warning signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity (e.g., nausea, fatigue, lethargy, pruritus, diarrhea, jaundice, right upper quadrant tenderness, and "flu-like" symptoms). If these occur, instruct patients to stop VIVLODEX and seek immediate medical therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

### Descriptive analysis of common causes of upper gastrointestinal bleeding in pediatric patients in kerman: a study from 2022 to 2023 [^116vYJ4v]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Method

Study design and setting

This study employed a cross-sectional design and was conducted at Afzalipour Hospital, a tertiary care center in Kerman, Iran. This hospital serves as a major referral center for pediatric cases in the southeastern region of the country. The study period spanned from January 1, 2022, to December 31, 2023, allowing for a comprehensive two-year assessment of UGIB incidence. The research aimed to investigate the common causes of UGIB in pediatric patients.

Study population

The study population comprised all pediatric patients with UGIB who presented to Afzalipour Hospital in Kerman during the specified time frame.

Inclusion criteria

Iranian children with at least a 1-year period of residency in Kerman.
Age below 18 years.
Diagnosis of UGIB.
Signing the informed consent form.

Exclusion criterion

Unavailability of patient medical records.

Sample size calculation

A census sampling method was employed based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria for the specified period (2022–2023). This approach ensured the inclusion of all eligible cases within the study timeframe, given the relatively low incidence of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) in pediatric populations. By including all 120 cases observed during the study period, we aimed to maximize the sample size and enhance the representativeness of the findings. While no formal power analysis was conducted, the census approach ensured that the data were adequate to meet the study's descriptive objectives. The primary aim was to describe the etiological distribution and clinical characteristics of pediatric UGIB in this regional population, with a focus on proportions, means, and frequencies rather than hypothesis testing.

Data collection

A comprehensive data collection form was used to extract information from patients' medical records. The following variables were collected:

Demographic information: age and gender.
Type of bleeding: hematemesis, melena, hematochezia, or combination of them.
Medication history.
Presence of underlying diseases.
Duration of hospitalization.
Cause of UGIB (dependent variable).

Data collection was performed by reviewing the medical records of children under 18 years of age diagnosed with UGIB who were admitted to the hospital between 2022 and 2023. The process began with the extraction of patient record numbers from the hospital's archival system. Subsequently, the records were examined sequentially, and the required information was extracted.

### Management of patients with ulcer bleeding [^111B2wFG]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2012). Medium credibility.

Upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) — initial assessment and risk stratification — Hemodynamic status should be assessed immediately upon presentation and resuscitative measures begun as needed (Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence). Randomized trials indicate that transfusions should be given to maintain hemoglobin ≥ 7 g/dl, with higher hemoglobin targets potentially needed in patients with other illnesses such as coronary artery disease and in those with intravascular volume depletion. Risk assessment should be performed to stratify patients into higher and lower risk categories, and may assist in management decisions such as timing of endoscopy, time of discharge, and level of care (Conditional recommendation, low-quality evidence). Discharge from the emergency department without inpatient endoscopy may be considered in very low-risk patients, including those meeting Blatchford score 0 criteria — urea nitrogen ≤ 18.2 mg/dl; hemoglobin ≥ 13.0 g/dl for men (12.0 g/dl for women); systolic blood pressure ≥ 110 mm Hg; pulse < 100 beats/min; and absence of melena, syncope, cardiac failure, and liver disease — who have < 1% chance of requiring intervention; instruments used include the pre-endoscopic Rockall score (range, 0–7) and the Blatchford score (range, 0–23).

Patient characteristics

Patient characteristics are outlined in Table 1. We included five studies with in total 4,086 patients (54% male). Four studies did have a study population of over 200 average risk subjects, the largest population comprised 2,249 average risk subjects. The smallest study had a population of 68 participants at average risk. All studies provided a clear description of patient characteristics and the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Three studies included high risk subjects: 2.6%, 5.2% and 11.3%, respectively. The corresponding authors of these papers were contacted to obtain data concerning average risk patients only. This succeeded in two out of three studies, resulting in a total of four datasets containing data of average risk subjects only and one study including 2.6% high risk participants. Resulting in a total of 4,086 participants, of which 37 were at high risk (0.9%). The mean age varied between 55 and 60.5 years, the minimal age was 50 in four studies.

Table 1
Patient characteristics included studies

a asymptomatic = free of symptoms of colonic diseases such as melena, haematochezia, diarrhoea, relevant changes in stool frequency or abdominal pain

b asymptomatic = no melena, anemia or hematochezia more than ones last 6 months, no lower abdominal pain

c asymptomatic = no significant GI signs or melena, hematochezia, iron-deficiency anemia, weight loss or abdominal pain within 6 months before study

### Descriptive analysis of common causes of upper gastrointestinal bleeding in pediatric patients in kerman: a study from 2022 to 2023 [^112uPmgW]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Results

A total of 120 neonatal and pediatric patients diagnosed with UGIB were included in this study. The mean age of the patients was 8.8 ± 4.7 years. Considering the age distribution, most patients fell within the 6–12 year age group (37.5%), followed by the 12–18 year age group (30%). The least represented age group in the study population was infants under one year of age, comprising 7 patients (5.8%) of the total patients (Fig. 1). Regarding gender distribution, 67 patients (55.8%) were male, and 53 patients (44.1%) were female.

Fig. 1
Age-wise distribution of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) causes in pediatric patients

A substantial majority (n = 84, 70%) of cases presented emergently, either through direct admission to the Accident and Emergency department or following initial assessment in primary care settings. A noteworthy proportion (n = 23, 19.2%) of patients were transferred from district general hospitals, underscoring the tertiary referral status of our institution. Internal referrals constituted a minority of cases (n = 13, 10.83%), subdivided into inpatient referrals (n = 8, 6.65%) and outpatient clinic referrals (n = 5, 4.15%).

The predominant presenting feature was isolated hematemesis, observed in 69 patients (57.5%). A combination of both hematemesis and melena was the second most common presentation, occurring in 40 patients (33.3%). Isolated melena was noted in 11 patients (9.16%), representing the least frequent presentation pattern.

### The role of endoscopy in the patient with lower GI bleeding [^112mcAHz]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2014). Medium credibility.

Lower gastrointestinal bleeding — recommendations: We recommend colonoscopy in patients with occult GI bleeding. We recommend EGD in patients with occult GI bleeding if a bleeding source is not identified in the colon, especially in those patients with upper GI symptoms, iron deficiency anemia, or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use. We suggest small-bowel evaluation after negative EGD and colonoscopy results in patients with occult GI bleeding who have persistent anemia. We recommend colonoscopy for the evaluation of chronic intermittent scant hematochezia in patients aged > 50 years and for patients who have iron deficiency anemia, risk factors for colorectal neoplasia, or the alarm symptoms of weight loss or bowel habit changes. We suggest that in younger patients presenting with chronic intermittent scant hematochezia without alarm symptoms, a digital rectal examination and flexible sigmoidoscopy may be sufficient evaluation. We recommend EGD in the initial evaluation of patients with melena followed by colonoscopy if the EGD result is negative. We recommend an initial EGD in patients with severe hematochezia and hemodynamic instability to evaluate for a high-risk upper GI lesion, followed by colonoscopy if the EGD result is negative. We suggest colonoscopy within 24 hours of admission after a rapid bowel preparation in the evaluation of patients with severe hematochezia. We recommend endoscopic treatment with epinephrine solution injection combined with thermal coagulation or endoscopic clip placement.

### Update on the management of upper gastrointestinal bleeding [^111NBVne]. BMJ Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) is a common and potentially life threatening condition. Defined as bleeding originating proximal to the ligament of Trietz; bleeding from the oesophagus, stomach, or duodenum can present as haematemesis, melaena; or, in the context of severe bleeding and rapid intestinal transit, haematochezia. Coffee ground vomiting can be due to non-bleeding pathology, including obstruction, but might indicate UGIB. In addition to externalisation of blood, patients can present with symptoms of blood loss such as syncope, fatigue, and shortness of breath. The cause of bleeding can be classified as variceal or non-variceal, with non-variceal including peptic ulcer bleeding. Peptic ulcer bleeding is the most common cause for UGIB despite Helicobacter pylori (H Pylori) eradication treatment and proton pump inhibitor use. While incidence of UGIB has been reported to be declining owing to a combination of drug and endotherapeutic interventions, emergency presentation is common with mortality between 2% and 10%.

Management of UGIB can be considered in three stages: pre-endoscopic management, endoscopic assessment and treatment, and post-endoscopic management. In this article, we review these stages with particular focus on initial management, including risk stratification, resuscitation, and drug treatment.

### British society of gastroenterology (BSG)-led multisociety consensus care bundle for the early clinical management of acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding [^111udD2P]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Recognition

We recommend that patients with haematemesis, melaena or coffee ground vomiting (CGV) in the absence of an alternate diagnosis (eg, bowel obstruction) trigger the AUGIB bundle

Level of evidence: Low

Level of recommendation: Strong

Agreement: 100%

Bundle recommendation: Trigger bundle if haematemesis, melaena or CGV (100% agreement)

Haematemesis and melaena are recognised symptoms of AUGIB. CGV refers to emesis that contains dark altered blood not due to any other cause such as bowel obstruction or sepsis. The appropriateness of including CGV as a trigger for the AUGIB bundle was evaluated. A recent study (n = 3012) prospectively compared outcomes following presentation with CGV compared with overt haematemesis and/or melaena. Clinical severity measured using risk stratification tools were all significantly lower in the isolated haematemesis group than in the CGV group, as CGV was associated with older patients with comorbidity. Although haematemesis was independently associated with higher rates of haemostatic intervention and rebleeding than CGV, there were no significant differences in the composite outcome of transfusion requirement, endoscopic intervention or death between presenting symptoms. Hence CGV should be considered a presenting feature of AUGIB.

Lower gastrointestinal bleeding is defined as occurring distal to the ligament of Treitz and presents as hematochezia, melena, or with anemia and positive fecal occult blood test. Imaging plays a pivotal role in the localization and treatment of lower gastrointestinal bleeds. Imaging tests in the workup of acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding include computed tomography (CT) angiography, nuclear medicine scintigraphy, and conventional catheter angiography. Catheter angiography can also be used to deliver treatment. Imaging tests in the workup of occult lower gastrointestinal bleeding include CT enterography and nuclear medicine Meckel scan.

Gastrointestinal Bleeding

Gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, a common complication of cirrhosis, represents a frequent cause of hospital admission and is associated with high morbidity and mortality. 19, 20, 21 There are several possible lesions that may cause GI bleeding in cirrhosis, most of them related to portal hypertension. GI bleeding is usually classified as upper or lower, according to whether the lesion responsible for bleeding is located above or below the angle of Treitz, respectively. The main causes of upper GI bleeding include gastric or esophageal varices and portal‐hypertensive gastropathy, whereas those of lower GI bleeding include rectal varices and portal‐hypertensive enteropathy or colopathy. Upper GI bleeding manifests as melena and/or hematemesis, whereas lower GI bleeding manifests as hematochezia. Although hematemesis and hemochezia are easily recognizable and usually prompt the patient to the emergency room, melena may not always be recognized as bleeding by some patients. As such, they may not seek attention immediately and treatment may be delayed. Symptoms of GI bleeding depend on the amount of blood loss and usually involve dizziness, lightheadedness, profuse sweating, loss of consciousness, and in most severe cases, hypovolemic shock. The severity of symptoms depends on various factors, particularly patient's age, rapidity of blood loss, and associated comorbidities. Supine tachycardia is specific for blood loss of 500‐1,000 mL, but not sensitive. Postural tachycardia of more than 30 beats/minute and inability to stand due to dizziness represents blood loss of approximately 1,000 mL. In addition to symptoms related to depletion of intravascular volume, GI bleeding may induce hepatic encephalopathy (HE), because absorption of blood and associated proteins in the gut is similar to intake of a large protein load. Importantly, some patients may develop symptoms of HE before the loss of blood has been recognized. Finally, portal hypertension–related GI bleeding has a high probability of recurrence unless measures to reduce its risk are established.

Information for Patients

 Patients should be informed of the following information before initiating therapy with an NSAID and periodically during the course of ongoing therapy. Patients should also be encouraged to read the NSAID Medication Guide that accompanies each prescription dispensed.

Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events

Advise patients to be alert for the symptoms of cardiovascular thrombotic events, including chest pain, shortness of breath, weakness, or slurring of speech, and to report any of these symptoms to their health care provider immediately [see WARNINGS].

Heart Failure And Edema

Advise patients to be alert for the symptoms of congestive heart failure including shortness of breath, unexplained weight gain, or edema and to contact their healthcare provider if such symptoms occur [see WARNINGS].

Diclofenac, like other NSAIDs, can cause GI discomfort and, rarely, more serious GI side effects, such as ulcers and bleeding, which may result in hospitalization and even death. Although serious GI tract ulcerations and bleeding can occur without warning symptoms, patients should be alert for the signs and symptoms of ulcerations and bleeding, and should ask for medical advice when observing any indicative sign or symptoms including epigastric pain, dyspepsia, melena, and hematemesis. Patients should be apprised of the importance of this follow-up [see WARNINGS, GASTROINTESTINAL EFFECTS: RISK OF ULCERATION, BLEEDING, AND PERFORATION].

### Three infants with rotavirus gastroenteritis complicated by severe gastrointestinal bleeding [^113rJKFV]. Journal of Medical Virology (2016). Low credibility.

Rotavirus gastroenteritis causes substantial morbidity and mortality worldwide in children. We report three infants with rotavirus gastroenteritis complicated by various severity of gastrointestinal bleeding. Two patients (cases 1 and 2) recovered completely without any specific treatments. One patient (case 3) died despite extensive treatments including a red blood cell transfusion and endoscopic hemostatic therapy. Rotavirus genotypes G1P[8] and G9P[8] were detected in cases 2 and 3, respectively. Rotavirus antigenemia levels were not high at the onset of melena, suggesting that systemic rotaviral infection does not play an important role in causing melena.

### Henoch-Schönlein purpura with acute pancreatitis: analysis of 13 cases [^115bjUzH]. BMC Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Henoch-Schönlein purpura is a common small vessel vasculitis in children. Acute pancreatitis rarely presents as a complication of Henoch-Schönlein purpura and has not been well characterized.

Methods

We retrospectively reviewed 13 cases of Henoch-Schönlein purpura with acute pancreatitis among 3212 patients who attended our hospital between January 2003 and June 2016 and analyzed their clinical characteristics, laboratory findings, imaging findings, treatment and overall prognosis.

Results

All patients had abdominal manifestations, including significant abdominal pain (13/13), vomiting (9/13), abdominal distension (3/13) and melena (6/13). Serum amylase level significantly increased in all patients, and urine amylase was increased in 7 cases (7/10). However, increased urine lapse was only noted in 2 cases (2/5), and diffuse swelling of the pancreas was seen in 2 cases (2/13) by abdominal ultrasonography. Although all patients had typical skin purpura (13/13), 5 patients (5/13) with acute pancreatitis initially experienced acute abdominal pain in clinical onset of Henoch-Schönlein purpura. Glucocorticoid therapy was effective in alleviating abdominal symptoms of Henoch-Schönlein purpura patients with acute pancreatitis. All patients were in good general condition without any abdominal complications 6–12 months after discharge.

Conclusions

Acute pancreatitis is rarely observed in Henoch-Schönlein purpura children and has no specific clinical features that differentiate it from abdominal manifestations of Henoch-Schönlein purpura. Therefore, in Henoch-Schönlein purpura patients with severe abdominal pain, serum amylase levels should be assessed to confirm the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis. Early diagnose of Henoch-Schönlein purpura with acute pancreatitis and treatment timely was very important for good clinical outcomes.

### Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus for clinicians-epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and prevention [^115u4pEK]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

The prehemorrhagic phase frequently lasts 1–5 days and is usually characterized by nonspecific symptoms. Those symptoms include sudden onset of fever, which lasts for an average of 4–5 days, and nonspecific signs and symptoms such as diarrhea, dizziness, headache, myalgia, nausea, vomiting, and weakness. Headache occurs in almost 70% of patients and tends to be severe. Two thirds of patients describe the pain as mimicking a migraine crisis, including throbbing and being accompanied by nausea, vomiting, photophobia, and phonophobia; half of patients describe the headache as worsening with activity. Characteristically, those patients might also develop upper body (face, neck, and chest) hyperemia, conjunctivitis, and congested sclera. Because of the lack of specificity in clinical manifestations, a high index of suspicion on the basis of a thorough exposure and travel history is essential for recognition.

The hemorrhagic illness phase typically begins 3–5 days after symptom onset and is usually short, lasting 1–3 days. This phase begins with a petechial rash of the skin and mucous membranes and might progress to more severe hemorrhagic features at multiple sites, including ecchymoses; cerebral hemorrhage; bleeding from the nasopharynx, gastrointestinal tract (hematemesis and melena), and genitourinary (hematuria) tract; menometrorrhagia; and hemoptysis. Epistaxis is present in < 50% of patients in the hemorrhagic phase, hematemesis in < 35% of patients, hematuria, melena and hematochezia in 10%–20% of patients, and intraabdominal or intracerebral bleeding in 1%–2% of cases. Large ecchymoses are present in 30%–45% of patients, and although they are not pathognomonic, their presence should suggest CCHF over other viral hemorrhagic fevers. Hepatosplenomegaly is common and described in up to one third of patients. Severe disease during this phase is often characterized by anemia, thrombocytopenia, evidence of coagulation abnormalities (prolonged prothrombin time [PT] and activated partial thromboplastin time [aPTT]) and disseminated intravascular coagulation. Liver enzymes, including alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST), are typically elevated. Renal insufficiency and hypotension are common in severe cases.

### Development and validation of a model to predict rebleeding within three days after endoscopic hemostasis for high-risk peptic ulcer bleeding [^1175596t]. BMC Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Peptic ulcer bleeding remains a typical medical emergency with significant morbidity and mortality. Peptic ulcer rebleeding often occurs within three days after emergent endoscopic hemostasis. Our study aims to develop a nomogram to predict rebleeding within three days after emergent endoscopic hemostasis for high-risk peptic ulcer bleeding.

Methods

We retrospectively reviewed the data of 386 patients with bleeding ulcers and high-risk stigmata who underwent emergent endoscopic hemostasis between March 2014 and October 2018. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator method was used to identify predictors. The model was displayed as a nomogram. Internal validation was carried out using bootstrapping. The model was evaluated using the calibration plot, decision-curve analyses, and clinical impact curve.

Results

Overall, 386 patients meeting the inclusion criteria were enrolled, with 48 patients developed rebleeding within three days after initial endoscopic hemostasis. Predictors contained in the nomogram included albumin, prothrombin time, shock, haematemesis/melena and Forrest classification. The model showed good discrimination and good calibration with a C-index of 0.854 (C-index: 0.830 via bootstrapping validation). Decision-curve analyses and clinical impact curve also demonstrated that it was clinically valuable.

Conclusion

This study presents a nomogram that incorporates clinical, laboratory, and endoscopic features, effectively predicting rebleeding within three days after emergent endoscopic hemostasis and identifying high-risk rebleeding patients with peptic ulcer bleeding.

Trial registration This clinical trial has been registered in the ClinicalTrials.gov (ID: NCT04895904) approved by the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE).

### Meloxicam (Xifyrm) [^111if8QJ]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.2	Gastrointestinal Effects- Risk of Ulceration, Bleeding, and Perforation

NSAIDs, including meloxicam, can cause serious gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events including inflammation, bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, or large intestine, which can be fatal. These serious adverse events can occur at any time, with or without warning symptoms, in patients treated with XIFYRM. Only one in five patients who develop a serious upper GI adverse event on NSAID therapy is symptomatic. Upper GI ulcers, gross bleeding, or perforation caused by NSAIDs occurred in approximately 1% of patients treated for 3–6 months, and in about 2–4% of patients treated for one year. However, even short- term NSAID therapy is not without risk.

Risk Factors for GI Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation

Patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or GI bleeding who used NSAIDs had a greater than 10-fold increased risk for developing a GI bleed compared to patients without these risk factors. Other factors that increase the risk of GI bleeding in patients treated with NSAIDs include longer duration of NSAID therapy; concomitant use of oral corticosteroids, aspirin, anticoagulants, or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs); smoking; use of alcohol; older age; and poor general health status. Most postmarketing reports of fatal GI events occurred in elderly or debilitated patients. Additionally, patients with advanced liver disease and/or coagulopathy are at increased risk for GI bleeding.

 Strategies to Minimize the GI Risks in NSAID-treated patients:

- Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest possible duration.

- Avoid administration of more than one NSAID at a time.

- Avoid use in patients at higher risk unless benefits are expected to outweigh the increased risk of bleeding. For such patients, as well as those with active GI bleeding, consider alternate therapies other than NSAIDs.

- Remain alert for signs and symptoms of GI ulceration and bleeding during NSAID therapy.

- If a serious GI adverse event is suspected, promptly initiate evaluation and treatment, and discontinue XIFYRM until a serious GI adverse event is ruled out.

- In the setting of concomitant use of low-dose aspirin for cardiac prophylaxis, monitor patients more closely for evidence of GI bleeding [see Drug Interactions (7)].

### Gastric reactive capillary hemangioma caused by tislelizumab [^1163UKFK]. Endoscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

A 71-year-old woman was admitted with melena for two months. She was being treated with tislelizumab and oral lenvatinib for hepatocellular carcinoma. Scattered pustular, exfoliative lesions were seen on the lower extremities (Fig. 1). Laboratory tests showed hemoglobin at 49.0 g/L and alpha-fetoprotein at 8073.00 ng/mL. Typically, the cause of melena is esophagogastric variceal bleeding. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography strongly demonstrated gastric malignancy (Fig. 2). Gastroscopy and ultrasound endoscopy revealed a huge cauliflower-like mass in the fundus of stomach and blood flow signals within it (Fig. 3, Video 1). The pathology of both biopsies showed blood clots and granulation tissue (Fig. 4). As a definitive diagnosis could not be made, the multidisciplinary team discussed the results as a rare programmed death 1 (PD-1)-associated gastric reactive capillary hemangioma and that the lesion was predominantly supplied by the left gastric artery. She then underwent embolization of the left gastric and gastric omental arteries, after which her melena was significantly better. However, she again had an amount of melena four weeks later. She then underwent two endoscopic sclerotherapy sessions, after which the blood flow signal within the lesion disappeared (Fig. 5, Video 1). At the six-week follow-up, she had no signs of gastrointestinal bleeding.

### Pure testicular choriocarcinoma with gastrointestinal metastasis and paraneoplastic symptoms: a case report [^112MLNo8]. BMC Urology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Testicular cancer is the most common cancer in young men, however, it is a rare cancer among general population. The gradual increase of its incidence makes it more important than ever. According to GLOBOCAN 2020 report, age-standard rate (ASR) for testicular cancer in world was 1.8 /100,000. The highest incidence rate were in Europe (west-north and south parts) and Oceania with ASR 7 followed by north America :5.6 and the lowest ASR belonged to Asia and Africa:2. Testicular choriocarcinoma is the rarest non-seminomatous germ cell tumor. The cancer has an aggressive behavior which has the worst prognosis of all types of testicular germ cell tumors, however, the lack of specific symptoms of it, makes the diagnosis difficult. At the time of diagnosis, almost 70% of the patients have metastatic disease. Early metastases to lung and liver is one of the typical characteristics of this tumor. Such symptoms of gastrointestinal are extremely rare. We report a case of testicular choriocarcinoma involving small intestine, lung, liver and kidney presenting with acute abdominal pain, melena and dyspnea with some paraneoplastic symptoms.

### COVID-19 severity is associated with the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding [^1121U5su]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

The presence of GI bleeding during hospitalisation was determined from the medical records. Patients with signs of GI bleeding (haematemesis, bloody stools, bleeding from an indwelling GI tube, or melena) and a confirmed diagnosis of GI bleeding by diagnostic imaging tests (CT or endoscopy) were considered to have GI bleeding. Information was collected on the diagnosis of the cause of bleeding as well as whether it was upper or lower GI bleeding.

In this study, it was also necessary to determine the risk of significant GI bleeding as its occurrence may require emergency endoscopic treatment. Therefore, we conducted a separate study to examine the association between the severity of COVID-19 and significant GI bleeding. Significant GI bleeding was defined as a decrease of 20 g/L or more in haemoglobin level at the time of GI bleeding from the baseline haemoglobin level on admission.

We also evaluated the treatment during hospitalisation according to the severity of COVID-19 to determine the association between posthospitalisation treatment and GI bleeding.

In addition, we investigated whether there was a difference in the pathogenesis of GI haemorrhage between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 pneumonia. Using an electronic medical record system, we collected the causes of GI bleeding among pneumonia admissions other than COVID-19 with GI bleeding at Tokyo Medical and Dental University between January 2020 and December 2021.

### Risk factors for mortality among patients admitted with upper gastrointestinal bleeding at a tertiary hospital: a prospective cohort study [^1153ocye]. BMC Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

The strength of this study was that it was a prospective study where many variables that could potentially predict adverse outcomes were assessed. Furthermore, all patients were followed-up in this study.

The study had some limitations. Half of the patients did not undergo endoscopy due to not being able to afford it. This may have underestimated the burden of some etiologies. Importantly, not undergoing endoscopy was an independent predictor of mortality. Therefore, more serious etiologies may have been missed which led to early death. Some laboratory values were not obtained for some patients and this may have underestimated or overestimated the significance of these factors with the outcomes. Presence of comorbidities was assessed by patient interview or clinical diagnosis. True melena was ascertained verbally only. This may have included some patients who had black stool from ingestion of previously prescribed ferrous sulphate. Gold standard criteria for diagnosis of comorbidities were not used in all patients. This study identified an important area in the local country but the results may not necessarily be generalisable to settings with different epidemiological disease patterns, particularly for chronic liver disease. Subgroup analysis to identify specific risk factors for mortality following variceal bleeding and ulcer bleeding could not be done due to small sample size these subgroups would have.

### Relationship of time to presentation after onset of upper GI bleeding with patient characteristics and outcomes: a prospective study [^1122iCyd]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2017). Low credibility.

Background and Aims

We performed a prospective multi-national study of patients presenting to the emergency department with upper GI bleeding (UGIB) and assessed the relationship of time to presentation after onset of UGIB symptoms with patient characteristics and outcomes.

Methods

Consecutive patients presenting with overt UGIB (red-blood emesis, coffee-ground emesis, and/or melena) from March 2014 to March 2015 at 6 hospitals were included. Multiple predefined patient characteristics and outcomes were collected. Rapid presentation was defined as ≤ 6 hours.

Results

Among 2944 patients, 1068 (36%) presented within 6 hours and 576 (20%) beyond 48 hours. Significant independent factors associated with presentation ≤ 6 hours versus > 6 hours on logistic regression included melena (odds ratio [OR], 0.22; 95% CI, 0.18–0.28), hemoglobin ≤ 80 g/L (OR, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.36–0.61), altered mental status (OR, 2.06; 95% CI, 1.55–2.73), albumin ≤ 30 g/L (OR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.14–1.78), and red-blood emesis (OR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.06–1.59). Patients presenting ≤ 6 hours versus > 6 hours required transfusion less often (286 [27%] vs 791 [42%]; difference, -15%; 95% CI, -19% to -12%) because of a smaller proportion with low hemoglobin levels, but were similar with regard to hemostatic intervention (189 [18%] vs 371 [20%]), 30-day mortality (80 [7%] vs 121 [6%]), and hospital days (5.0 ± 0.2 vs 5.0 ± 0.2).

Conclusions

Patients with melena alone delay their presentation to the hospital. A delayed presentation is associated with a decreased hemoglobin level and increases the likelihood of transfusion. Other outcomes are similar with rapid versus delayed presentation. Time to presentation should not be used as an indicator for poor outcome. Patients with delayed presentation should be managed with the same degree of care as those with rapid presentation.

### Causes of bleeding and outcomes in patients hospitalized with upper gastrointestinal bleeding [^111yvdZ4]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Goals

To evaluate sources of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) at an urban US hospital and compare them to sources at the same center 20 years ago, and to assess clinical outcomes related to source of UGIB.

Background

Recent studies suggest changes in causes and outcomes of UGIB.

Study

Consecutive patients with hematemesis, melena, and/or hematochezia undergoing upper endoscopy with an identified source at LA County+USC Medical Center from January 2005 to June 2011 were identified retrospectively.

Results

Mean age of the 1929 patients was 52 years; 75% were male. A total of 1073 (55%) presented with hematemesis, 809 (42%) with melena alone, and 47 (2%) with hematochezia alone. The most common causes were ulcers in 654 patients (34%), varices in 633 (33%), and erosive esophagitis in 156 (8%), compared with 43%, 33%, and 2% in 1991. During hospitalization, 207 (10.7%) patients required repeat endoscopy for UGIB (10.6% for both ulcers and varices) and 129 (6.7%) died (5.2% for ulcers; 9.2% for varices). On multivariate analysis, hematemesis (OR = 1.38; 95% CI, 1.04–1.88) and having insurance (OR = 1.44; 95% CI, 1.07–1.94) were associated with repeat endoscopy for UGIB. Varices (OR = 1.53; 95% CI, 1.05–2.22) and having insurance (OR = 4.53; 95% CI, 2.84–7.24) were associated with mortality.

Conclusion

Peptic ulcers decreased modestly over 2 decades, whereas varices continue as a common cause of UGIB at an urban hospital serving lower socioeconomic patients. Inpatient mortality, but not rebleeding requiring endoscopy, was higher with variceal than nonvariceal UGIB, indicating patients with variceal UGIB remain at risk of death from decompensation of underlying illness even after successful control of bleeding.

### Severity and outcomes of upper gastrointestinal bleeding with bloody vs. coffee-grounds hematemesis [^116SGeyj]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

Numerous reviews indicate bloody hematemesis signifies more severe bleeding than coffee-grounds hematemesis. We assessed severity and outcomes related to bleeding symptoms in a prospective study.

Methods

Consecutive patients presenting with hematemesis or melena were categorized as bloody emesis (N = 1209), coffee-grounds emesis without bloody emesis (N = 701), or melena without hematemesis (N = 1069). We assessed bleeding severity (pulse, blood pressure) and predictors of outcome (hemoglobin, risk stratification scores) at presentation, and outcomes of bleeding episodes. The primary outcome was a composite of transfusion, intervention, or mortality.

Results

Bloody and coffee-grounds emesis were similar in pulse ≥ 100 beats/min (35 vs. 37%), systolic blood pressure ≤ 100mmHg (12 vs. 12%), and hemoglobin ≤ 100g/l (25 vs. 27%). Risk stratification scores were lower with bloody emesis. The composite end point was 34.7 vs. 38.2% for bloody vs. coffee-grounds emesis; mortality was 6.6 vs. 9.3%. Hemostatic intervention was more common (19.4 vs. 14.4%) with bloody emesis (due to a higher frequency of varices necessitating endoscopic therapy), as was rebleeding (7.8 vs. 4.5%). Outcomes were worse with hematemesis plus melena vs. isolated hematemesis for bloody (composite: 62.4 vs. 25.6%; hemostatic intervention: 36.5 vs. 13.8%) and coffee-grounds emesis (composite: 59.1 vs. 27.1%; hemostatic intervention: 26.4 vs. 8.1%).

Conclusions

Bloody emesis is not associated with more severe bleeding episodes at presentation or higher mortality than coffee-grounds emesis, but is associated with modestly higher rates of hemostatic intervention and rebleeding. Outcomes with hematemesis are worsened with concurrent melena. The presence of bloody emesis plus melena potentially could be considered in decisions regarding timing of endoscopy.

### Hemosuccus pancreaticus: a rare cause of gastrointestinal bleeding [^116rDERz]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Hemorrhage from the pancreatic duct, referred to as hemosuccus pancreaticus or pseudohemobilia, is a rare cause of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. This potentially life-threatening complication of pancreatitis may pose a significant diagnostic and therapeutic dilemma, especially in patients who do not exhibit symptoms such as abdominal pain, jaundice, or GI bleeding. Here we describe a 55-year-old male with a known history of chronic calcifying pancreatitis, who presented with repeated episodes of melena associated with paroxysms of abdominal pain and frequent drop in hemoglobin requiring hospitalization. Initial endoscopic evaluation was negative. Endoscopy was repeated after an episode of melena which showed blood spurting from the ampulla. Further evaluation with abdominal CT scan, CT angiogram and conventional angiogram revealed no source of blood loss. Hence emergency surgery was done. There was evidence of splenic vein rupturing into the pancreatic duct.

Quality assessment

Table S 1 (Supplementary information) summarizes the quality of each cohort study. The 16 cohort studies were considered to provide level 2b evidence. All 11 case reports (including 1 case series) were considered level 4 evidence.

Baseline characteristics

The twenty-seven articles included a total of 230 patients, of whom 149 (64.8%) patients presented with lower GIB (complaints of melena, hematochezia), one patient (0.43%) with upper GIB, 26 (11.3%) patients with both upper GIB and lower GIB and 54 (23.5%) patients with GIB from unknown/unreported region. Duration of these complaints ranged from 2 weeks up to 4 years, with some patients (58/230, 25.2%) presenting with recurrent episodes of GIB. 57.1% (4/7) studies reported the duration between these recurrent episodes (mean duration between episodes: 13.6 months).

### Small intestine duplication cyst with recurrent hematochezia: a case report and literature review [^114Bx84k]. BMC Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

The manifestations of EDCs often vary based on the different locations in the digestive tract. Most of them are asymptomatic and some have symptoms, including feeding intolerance, abdominal pain, nausea, acute intestine obstruction, perforation, hematochezia, and palpable abdominal mass according to physical examination. Among these, abdominal pain and melena are the most common symptoms. The accumulation of secretions within the EDC can cause intense pain and potential obstruction due to compression of the adjacent enteric lumen. The mass effect over adjacent structures may also lead to obstruction of the vena cava, biliary tree, or ureter, resulting in hydronephrosis. It is a population that is not detected in early childhood and is later diagnosed in adulthood. Subsequent diagnosis is sometimes made by chance during imaging or laparotomy. Hematochezia is the protruding manifestation of our case due to the bleeding of SIDC. The age of our case is also extremely rare, as most similar cases were reported in childhood.

It is generally difficult to establish a confirmed diagnosis of EDC. X-ray results may be normal as the intestines are not being manifested very well and contrast examination is helpful to show the communication between the EDC and the native digestive tract. A diagnosis of EDC can be achieved by ultrasound with typical inner echogenic mucosal and outer hypoechoic muscle layers. CT and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have the advantage of three-dimensional imaging and are effective methods for differential diagnosis, such as Meckel's diverticulum, appendicitis, choledochal cyst, and intussusception. Although our diagnosis was mistaken as intussusception but not SIDC based on the "doughnut" sign revealed on CT imaging, our patient didn't have acute severe abdominal pain which was the typical symptom of intussusception. We therefore performed two capsule endoscopes in order to try our best to find the causes of bleeding and revealed a protruding lesion with bleeding in the distal ileum.

### Society of Critical Care Medicine and American Society of Health-system Pharmacists guideline for the prevention of stress-related gastrointestinal bleeding in critically ill adults [^1128g6TY]. Critical Care Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Stress-related upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) in critically ill adults — definitions and recommendation framework are specified as follows: The panel defined overt UGIB as any bleeding resulting in signs or symptoms of active bleeding including hematemesis, hematochezia, or melena and clinically important UGIB as any bleeding resulting in hemodynamic instability or the need for transfusion; EN (enteral nutrition) was defined as any nutrition given via an enteral tube irrespective of route and quantity of nutrition. Each recommendation statement was assigned a strength ("Strong" or "Conditional"), where a "Strong" recommendation is one that clinicians should follow for almost all patients, and a "Conditional" recommendation reflects a lower degree of certainty in the appropriateness of the patient care strategy for all patients.

Information for Patients

Patients should be informed of the following information before initiating therapy with an NSAID and periodically during the course of ongoing therapy. Patients should also be encouraged to read the NSAID Medication Guide that accompanies each prescription dispensed.

1. Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events

Advise patients to be alert for the symptoms of cardiovascular thrombotic events, including chest pain, shortness of breath, weakness, or slurring of speech, and to report any of these symptoms to their health care provider immediately [see Warnings].

2. Ketoprofen capsules, like other NSAIDs, can cause GI discomfort and, rarely, serious GI side effects, such as ulcers and bleeding, which may result in hospitalization and even death. Although serious GI tract ulcerations and bleeding can occur without warning symptoms, patients should be alert for the signs and symptoms of ulcerations and bleeding, and should ask for medical advice when observing any indicative signs or symptoms including epigastric pain, dyspepsia, melena, and hematemesis. Patients should be apprised of the importance of this follow-up (see WARNINGS, Gastrointestinal Effects - Risk of Ulceration, Bleeding, and Perforation).

3. Serious Skin Reactions, including DRESS

Advise patients to stop taking ketoprofen capsules immediately if they develop any type of rash

or fever and to contact their healthcare provider as soon as possible [see Warnings].

### External validation of the Oakland score to assess safe hospital discharge among adult patients with acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding in the US [^113JuSk3]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB) is a common presentation in the emergency departments of hospitals worldwide. In comparison with upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB), LGIB is likely to have a less severe course. Compared with patients with UGIB, patients with LGIB are less likely to present with hemorrhagic shock or require red blood cell (RBC) transfusions or interventions to treat bleeding, and in-hospital mortality rates among patients with LGIB are lower. Acute LGIB typically presents with bright red rectal bleeding or blood clots from the rectum, whereas the presenting features of UGIB include hematemesis, coffee-ground emesis, and melena. Unlike patients with UGIB, for which risk stratification scores, such as the Rockalland Glasgow-Blatchfordscores, are used, patients with LGIB have no equivalent risk score tool available.

In 2016, the American College of Gastroenterology recommended that risk assessment be performed but did not endorse the use of any single tool. Since the publication of this guideline, the Oakland Scorewas developed within a nationally representative sample of patients in the United Kingdom. Rather than calculating a risk score for death or inpatient intervention, the Oakland Score was designed to identify patients who were at low risk of experiencing adverse outcomes and whose conditions could safely be managed without hospitalization. Despite limited external validation of the Oakland Score, national guidelines in the United Kingdom have recently recommended use of the tool for the triage of patients with acute LGIB. Therefore, the aim of this study was to externally validate the Oakland Score in a large population of patients with acute LGIB from the United States and compare the performance of the Oakland Score at 2 score thresholds (≤ 8 points vs ≤ 10 points).

Pediatric non‑EoE EGIDs — diagnostic criteria: We recommend that the diagnosis of non-EoE EGIDs in children and adolescents must include all three of the following: (a) Symptoms and/or signs of GI dysfunction including but not limited to vomiting, abdominal pain/cramping, bloating, anorexia, weight loss, early satiety, hematemesis, heartburn, dyspepsia, tenesmus, diarrhea or constipation, hematochezia or melena, abdominal distention, ascites, iron deficiency, protein loss. (b) Dense eosinophilic infiltrates found in mucosal or full thickness biopsies above organ specific threshold values (See Table 6). (c) Absence of other diseases associated with GI mucosal eosinophilic inflammation (See Table 8). SoR: Strong, Agreement: 91%.

### Gastric devascularization in a neonate with massive upper GI bleeding: a case report and literature review [^112KCrUk]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, massive UGI bleeding in neonates is a rare but life-threatening condition. Hematemesis and/or melena accompanied by hemodynamic instability should raise a suspicion of UGI bleeding. Stress gastritis and ulcers are common causes. If the patient's status is stable after blood transfusion, early endoscopic assessment might be an option for accurate diagnosis and precise management. In cases with uncontrolled bleeding, surgery remains a vital option for the management of massive UGI bleeding in neonates. However, prospective randomized clinical studies are needed.
