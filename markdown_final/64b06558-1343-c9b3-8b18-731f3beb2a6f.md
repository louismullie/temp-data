## Question

A 51-year-old man seeks evaluation from his family physician with a complaint of heartburn, which has been gradually increasing over the last 10 years. The heartburn gets worse after eating spicy foods and improves with antacids. The past medical history is benign. He is a security guard and works long hours at night. He admits to smoking 1.5 packs of cigarettes every day. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy reveals several gastric ulcers and regions of inflammation. A biopsy is obtained, which revealed gram-negative bacteria colonized on the surface of the regenerative epithelium of the stomach, as shown in the micrograph below. Which of the following bacterial products is responsible for neutralizing the acidity of the stomach?

Answer Choices:
A. β-lactamase
B. Hyaluronidase
C. Urease
D. Prostaglandins

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which bacterial product is responsible for neutralizing stomach acidity in Helicobacter pylori infection, with options including β-lactamase, hyaluronidase, urease, and prostaglandins. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about identifying the organism and its gastric niche. Then, I should verify the core acid-resistance mechanism. Next, I will examine each option against known pathophysiology. Finally, I will confirm the answer and briefly note why the alternatives are incorrect, anchoring on high-quality sources.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and organism. The vignette describes gastric ulcers with gram-negative bacteria on regenerative epithelium, which fits Helicobacter pylori colonizing the gastric mucosa, a setting where H. pylori must survive at pH levels that are lethal to most bacteria, often below 2 in the lumen, while residing near the epithelial surface where pH is closer to neutral [^e26b7c58] [^b35d0912].

> Now, I need to check the primary acid-resistance mechanism. Multiple high-credibility sources converge on urease as the central virulence factor that enables gastric survival: H. pylori produces abundant cytoplasmic urease that hydrolyzes urea into ammonia and carbon dioxide, generating a local ammonia cloud that buffers the periplasm and nearby environment to approximately pH 6.1 even when luminal pH is below 2, which is essential for colonization and persistence [^e26b7c58] [^bac2d0ac] [^b35d0912].

> Wait, let me verify the role of the urea channel and regulation. The proton-gated urea channel HpUreI senses low pH and opens to deliver urea to intracellular urease, ensuring ammonia production precisely when needed; this coordinated system is a validated drug target and explains why urease inhibitors and acid suppression improve eradication outcomes, reinforcing the centrality of urease-mediated alkalinization [^bac2d0ac] [^e26b7c58].

> I will now examine the distractors. β-lactamase is an antibiotic-resistance enzyme that degrades β-lactam antibiotics; it has no role in acid neutralization, so choosing it would conflate antimicrobial resistance with acid adaptation, which is incorrect. Hyaluronidase is a mucin-degrading enzyme used by some pathogens to facilitate tissue invasion; it does not neutralize gastric acid, so it does not fit the question's mechanism. Prostaglandins are host eicosanoids that modulate gastric acid secretion and mucosal defense; they are not bacterial products and therefore cannot be the answer here, even though H. pylori infection can alter host prostaglandin signaling indirectly.

> Hold on, I should verify whether any alternative bacterial products meaningfully contribute to acid buffering. While H. pylori has additional ammonia-generating pathways such as glutamine/asparagine deamidases, these are secondary and not the principal mechanism credited with neutralizing gastric acidity; the dominant, repeatedly validated driver is urease-dependent ammonia production, which directly answers the question [^5063ea9a] [^e26b7c58] [^bac2d0ac].

> Putting this together, the correct answer is C. Urease, because H. pylori's urease generates ammonia from urea, creating a local alkaline microenvironment that neutralizes gastric acid and permits survival in the stomach [^e26b7c58] [^bac2d0ac] [^b35d0912].

---

The correct answer is **C. Urease**. Helicobacter pylori uses **urease** to hydrolyze urea into ammonia and carbon dioxide, creating a microenvironment that neutralizes gastric acid and allows bacterial survival in the stomach [^e26b7c58] [^bac2d0ac]. β-lactamase is an antibiotic-resistance enzyme, hyaluronidase degrades connective tissue, and prostaglandins are host signaling molecules — none of which neutralize stomach acid.

---

## Mechanism of gastric acid neutralization by Helicobacter pylori

H. pylori survives the harsh gastric environment primarily through **urease activity**, which hydrolyzes urea into ammonia and carbon dioxide [^e26b7c58]. Ammonia rapidly reacts with hydrogen ions to form ammonium, locally raising pH and protecting the bacteria from acid damage [^bac2d0ac]. This microenvironment allows H. pylori to colonize the gastric mucosa and contributes to pathogenesis [^b35d0912].

---

## Role of urease in Helicobacter pylori infection

Urease is a **key virulence factor** in H. pylori infection:

- **Acid resistance**: Urease-generated ammonia neutralizes gastric acid, enabling survival and colonization [^e26b7c58].
- **Mucosal damage**: Ammonia and other urease byproducts damage gastric epithelium, promoting inflammation and ulcer formation [^notfound].
- **Diagnostic marker**: Urease activity is exploited in diagnostic tests (e.g. urea breath test, rapid urease test) [^11d5420a].

---

## Other bacterial products and their roles

| **Bacterial product** | **Role in h. pylori infection** |
|-|-|
| β-lactamase | Antibiotic resistance enzyme; does not neutralize acid [^notfound] |
| Hyaluronidase | Degrades connective tissue; facilitates bacterial spread; does not neutralize acid [^notfound] |
| Prostaglandins | Host signaling molecules; not bacterial products; do not neutralize acid [^notfound] |

---

## Clinical implications of urease activity

Understanding urease activity has **important clinical implications**:

- **Therapeutic targets**: Urease inhibitors are being explored as potential treatments to disrupt acid resistance and enhance antibiotic efficacy [^notfound].
- **Diagnostic tools**: Urease-based tests are widely used for rapid diagnosis of H. pylori infection [^11d5420a].
- **Pathogenesis**: Urease contributes to mucosal injury, inflammation, and ulcer formation, underscoring its role in disease severity [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion

The bacterial product responsible for neutralizing stomach acidity in H. pylori infection is **urease**, which generates ammonia to create a protective alkaline microenvironment [^e26b7c58]. This mechanism is central to H. pylori survival, pathogenesis, and diagnosis [^b35d0912] [^11d5420a].

Helicobacter pylori infection — pathobiology and clinical consequences are outlined, noting that Helicobacter pylori is a Gram-negative, spiral-shaped bacterium adapted to the harsh acidic environment of the human stomach and remains one of the most common chronic bacterial infections worldwide; it is the leading cause of infection-associated cancer globally and is categorized by the World Health Organization International Agency for Research on Cancer as a group 1 (definite) carcinogen because of its causal association with gastric cancer; all individuals who do not spontaneously clear the infection will develop chronic gastritis, though most infected individuals will remain asymptomatic and develop no meaningful clinical consequences, while many will develop a wide range of benign or malignant clinical consequences.

Production of acid in the upper gastrointestinal tract has been preserved during phylogenesis, reflecting the importance of the main function of gastric juice; that is killing of swallowed microorganisms. The normal gastric juice creates a hostile milieu for microorganisms, making the luminal content of the stomach as well as the small intestine relatively sterile. Inflammation of the gastric mucosa was some decades ago so prevalent that gastritis even was considered a natural consequence of aging. However, it was rather early recognized that gastritis was related to gastric cancer since gastric cancer only developed in stomachs with gastritis. It was, therefore, a great breakthrough when it was shown that Helicobacter pylori (Hp) infection was the major cause of gastritis. Although it is more than 25 years since the central role of Hp in the pathogenesis of upper gastrointestinal disease was realized, there are still unresolved questions related to the interaction between Hp and the host, like the mechanism for the carcinogenic effect and the susceptibility for Hp infection. This paper aims to make a concise review of the interactions between Hp and humans.

Transition to chronic infection

We do not know for sure, but the prevailing hypothesis is that, once infected, Hp gastritis becomes chronic; if not, Hp is eradicated by treatment. The transition from acute to chronic gastritis is accompanied by restoration of gastric acid secretion. However, what happens in the stomach in this phase is not known. Moreover, why the infection is confined to the antral mucosa in some patients whereas pan-gastritis occurs in others is unknown, although differences in mucosal acidity may play a role. The oral spread of infection caused by inhibition of gastric acid secretion also suggests that local acidity plays a role in the distribution of Hp infection.

The spiral shape and flagella help Hp to bore into the mucous layer where there is a pH gradient due to H + diffusing from the luminal side and HCO 3 − from the epithelial cells. Hp is dependent on a near neutral pH to thrive; the urease activity of Hp increases pH in the vicinity, thus making it possible for Hp to survive at a more acidic place. In many ways, a slightly acidic milieu is ideal for Hp growth since its NH 3 production otherwise could induce too alkaline milieu for the bacterium.

### Probiotics as the live microscopic fighters against Helicobacter pylori gastric infections [^ae39d7cb]. BMC Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Probiotics as anti- H. pylori agents

Comprehensive definition of probiotics

Probiotics are a group of living microorganisms that generally colonize the gastrointestinal tract and have undeniable effects for improving human health. Today, the clinical benefits of probiotics are widely accepted; their therapeutic applications are in disorders such as diarrhea, antibiotic-associated diarrhea, functional digestive involvements, inflammatory bowel disease, cardiovascular diseases, allergic reactions, and cancer. Lactobacillus spp. are one of the most well-known probiotics that their anti- H. pylori properties have been proven. According to the evidence, colonization rate of Lactobacillus spp. in normal human gastric is 0–10 3 CFU (resistant to acidic conditions of the human stomach for 2 h); some Lactobacillus strains prevent the persistent colonization of H. pylori due to their specific adhesins. According to the European Helicobacter Pylori Study Group (EHPSG), adjuvant therapy with probiotics can be helpful in increasing the cure rate of infections. In addition to Lactobacillus spp. many other bacteria are accounted as bacterial probiotics against H. pylori; characteristics such as names of probiotics, their potential activity, in-vitro or in-vivo examinations, and country of study are listed in Table 1. However, some probiotics such as Lactobacillus spp. and Bifidobacterium spp. have been used more in clinical trials than other probiotics. According to the literature, administration of a dairy product supplemented with Lactobacillus spp. and Bifidobacterium spp. increases both mucosal and systemic IgA response against to gastrointestinal infections. Sheu et al. showed in their study that a yogurt containing these bacteria could improve the eradication rate of H. pylori infection, and also restore the depletion of Bifidobacterium in stool at the fifth week of treatment. In addition, these bacteria can produce significant amounts of lactic acid in the stomach after successful colonization.

Network analysis clarifies the effect of Helicobacter pylori infection on gastric mucosal microbiota

The stomach was long thought sparsely colonized by bacteria due to the gastric microbicidal acidic barrier (pH < 4.0). This view dramatically changed with the discovery of the Gram-negative bacterium H. pylori in the 1980's by Warren and Marshall, that is a carcinogenic bacterial pathogen infecting the stomach of more than one-half of the world's human population. This human pathogen is able to survive in the highly acidic environment within the stomach by producing cytoplasmic urease that, by catalysing the hydrolysis of urea into CO 2 and NH 4, produces a neutralizing ammonia cloud around it. However, most H. pylori avoid the acidic environment of the gastric lumen by swimming towards the mucosal cell surface (using their polar flagella and chemotaxis mechanisms) and may adhere and invade the gastric mucosal epithelial cells. Hence, it doesn't represent a dominant species in gastric fluid microbiota, but was found to generally reside in the gastric mucosae.

Persistent (chronic) infection with this Gram-negative bacterium induces changes in gastric physiology and immunology, e.g. reduced gastric acidity and parietal cell mass, perturbed nutrient availability, local innate immune responses, that most probably induces shift in gastric microbiota composition. Although H. pylori colonization usually persists in the human stomach for many decades without adverse effects, the infection of this bacteria is associated with increased risk for several diseases, including peptic ulcers, chronic gastritis, mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma, gastric adenocarcinoma, and dyspepsia. The potential alterations induced by the H. pylori can in turn lead to dysbiosis and may cause aberrant proinflammatory immune responses, susceptibility to bacterial pathogens and increased risk of gastric disease, including cancer. However, the effect of H. pylori infection on overall composition of gastric microbiota at genus level and the bacterial interplay in presence of this widespread human infection remain unclear.

### The gastric acid pocket (or coat) and its attenuation in Helicobacter pylori-infected subjects [^1b46b54e]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

In 2001, it was observed that the cardia region of the lumen of the stomach remained highly acidic after a meal and escaped the buffering effect of the food. This phenomenon was termed the acid pocket and is thought to explain why reflux symptoms occur after meals despite the buffering effect of food. This review describes the discovery of the acid pocket and our progress in understanding the intragastric physiology producing it, its exaggeration in hiatus hernia and role in reflux disease. The recent discovery that the acid pocket is attenuated in the Helicobacter pylori-infected population and the significance of this to the negative association between H. pylori and reflux disease and its complications is also addressed. Finally, the role of the acid pocket in providing protection from potentially pathogenic ingested microorganisms is discussed.

### Cryo-EM structure of Helicobacter pylori urease with an inhibitor in the active site at 2.0 å resolution [^e26b7c58]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Helicobacter pylori is a Gram-negative neutralophile that has acquired a set of genes called the ure gene cluster, that, in the presence of urea, enable the bacterium to survive at extremely acidic pH. Exploiting this unique ability, H. pylori is estimated to be colonizing the stomachs of roughly half the world population, causing a wide spectrum of diseases ranging from gastritis and gastric ulcers to stomach cancer. Gastric cancer is the third most common cause of cancer death worldwide and more than 90% of the cases are attributable to chronic H. pylori infection.

Current eradication, called triple therapy, entails ingesting a proton-pump inhibitor and two broadband antibiotics, however, resistance to antibiotics clarithromycin and metronidazole is generally greater than 25% and rising. This resistance has resulted in H. pylori 's inclusion in the WHO Global Priority List of Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria, underscoring the urgent need for a targeted, high-specificity H. pylori eradication drug.

The ure gene cluster is comprises seven genes, two of which code for a nickel-dependent urease (ureA and ureB) that hydrolyzes urea into NH 3 and CO 2, one for a pH-gated urea channel (ureI) that delivers host gastric urea to urease in the bacterial cytoplasm, and four for cytoplasmic accessory proteins involved in nickel processing. In addition, other proteins, such as a periplasmic α-carbonic anhydrase, are also required for colonization of the human stomach.

H. pylori 's proton-gated plasma membrane urea channeland cytoplasmic urease are both virulence factors and essential for its survival in the stomach. The channel senses periplasmic pH and, while closed at neutral pH, opens upon acidification to allow diffusion of urea from the gastric juice to the cytoplasmic urease, which comprises about 10% of the total bacterial protein. Once in the cytoplasm, urea is hydrolyzed rapidly by urease into ammonia and carbon dioxide, buffering the cytoplasm and periplasm even in gastric juice at acidity levels below pH 2.

### Helicobacter pylori [^7707015c]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Helicobacter pylori is an important human pathogen, responsible for most peptic ulcer disease, gastritis and gastric malignancies. H. pylori has several unique features: it is highly adapted for gastric colonization, yet it produces clinical consequences in a small minority, its genome is known, and it is the only bacterium strongly associated with cancer. H. pylori is therefore of great interest to clinicians and researchers of many, often disparate, disciplines. We highlight recent advances in this fast changing field from many different areas.

Recent Findings

The major contentious clinical issues relate to the synergistic gastrotoxic interactions of H. pylori with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and a possible association of H. pylori with atherosclerotic events. Accumulating evidence implicates genetic variation in the inflammatory response to H. pylori in the etiology of the increased risk of gastric cancer after H. pylori infection. Studies of pathogenesis have been aided by increasingly sophisticated murine models. The effects in gastric epithelial cells of two of the major virulence factors (genes within the cag pathogenicity island and the vacuolating cytotoxin, VacA) of H. pylori illustrate the complex network of cellular reactions activated by H. pylori. The metabolism of H. pylori is dependent on the availability of hydrogen.

Summary

Basic science research into H. pylori continues to elucidate the mechanisms by which H. pylori infection causes disease. These findings have implications for the design of novel therapies and for improving clinical strategies to identify at-risk individuals. Many are also worthy of consideration for other epithelial-microbial interactions.

### And gastric acid: an intimate and reciprocal relationship [^cdc1467f]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Figure 1.
The different phases of the relationship between Helicobacter and gastric acid.

(a) The initial infection is facilitated by reduced gastric acidity. (b) The initial infection causes reduction in gastric acidity. (c) Although the infection persists, gastric acidity is by some reason or the other restored. (d) When the Hp infection causes atrophy of the oxyntic glands, gastric acid secretion declines. (e) When the oxyntic atrophy is so pronounced that sufficient gastric acidity is not reached, hypergastrinemia develops and the patient is concomitantly predisposed for gastric cancer.

Thus, gastric acidity probably has a protective role in the defense against the initial Hp infection. The use of inhibitors of gastric acid secretion in small children, which recently has been reported to predispose for Clostridium infection, may also make these children more susceptible to Hp infection.

### Helicobacter pylori initiates successful gastric colonization by utilizing L-lactate to promote complement resistance [^977fd6b5]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

This effect of loss of complement occurred in both the antrum and corpus, but was greater in the latter. This bacterial load difference could be due to higher complement levels in the corpus, or alternatively, higher complement resistance in the antrum. Studies investigating the prevalence of subregional complement components in the stomach reported some compounds, e.g. activated C3, were more abundant in antrum and others, e.g. the membrane attack complex, were deposited equally between the two regions. We noticed similar complexity from examining mouse samples. In future studies, a systematic analysis would be needed to elucidate whether there is regional variation in complement activities and how this differentially impacts local H. pylori viability. Interestingly, our work showed that H. pylori infection elevated L-lactate levels more in the antrum than the corpus. This finding suggests that H. pylori may be more complement resistant in the antrum due to high lactate levels, and thus does not show a great effect of C3 loss. Another key aspect of the corpus is its lower pH compared to the antrum. Our results show that complement retains the ability to kill H. pylori killing even at low pH. Low pH itself is harmful to H. pylori, so this outcome may suggest that although complement has reduced activity at low pH, there is still enough activity to decrease H. pylori numbers.

Furthermore, H. pylori resides and multiplies in the local niches where the pH is closer to neutral. Although the human stomach is more acidic than the mouse one, H. pylori resides at the near-neutral epithelial surface, and thus the species-specific pH differences may not have a great effect on complement functions in H. pylori colonizing niches and suggests that our findings would apply well to humans. Complement lowers bacterial numbers by several mechanisms, including direct lysis and opsonization. We propose that cell lysis dominates the complement-mediated activities in vivo because there are few immune cells present in the stomach during H. pylori early infection. Indeed, immune cells are only recruited above basal levels after ~3 weeks of infection. There may be subtle effects that we cannot rule out or detect, however, due to low level immune cell recruitment and effects of C3 loss on anaphylatoxin release (C3a and C5a) –. Our finding that H. pylori blocks C4b deposition supports this proposal, because a blockade at this step would also prevent creation of the C3a and C5a products, which are immune cell chemoattractants.

Acute infection by Helicobacter pylori

Whereas it is well known how Helicobacter pylori (Hp) can survive in the superficial mucous layer by its urease activity causing a livable pH in its vicinity, the mechanisms by which Hp can survive and proliferate when infecting a normal stomach are not so well understood. Nevertheless, the two known voluntary infections were successful only after inhibition of gastric acidity, suggesting the role of gastric juice in the defense against the initial infection. Both these subjects developed self-limited symptoms from the epigastric area with fullness, nausea and vomiting some days after the infection and lasting for about a week. Similarly, in an outbreak of gastritis due to contamination of equipment used in a study where gastric acid secretion was determined multiple times in healthy subjects, the participants developed hypoacidity, gastritis and similar symptoms as those voluntarily infected with Hp. Hp has retrospectively been presumed to be the causative agent. Also in these subjects, Hp may have been introduced to the stomach without gastric juice, which was continuously aspirated or as part of studying meal-stimulated acid secretion where the luminal content in vivo was titrated to pH 5.0. Thus, during the two voluntary infections, as well as the transmission by the nasogastric tube, Hp entered a stomach without acid [Figure 1(a)], allowing the bacterium to bury into the mucous layer before normal gastric acidity was reestablished. In most cases of chronic Hp gastritis, there is no information of any symptomatic episode. This may indicate that most of the acute infections are asymptomatic, or alternatively, a gastroenteritis due to Hp infection has been misdiagnosed as viral. Moreover, childhood Hp infection seems to be prevalent, which may be explained by reduced gastric acidity during early life. Alternatively, gastroenteritis by other causes may make the gastric content hypoacidic and thus give time and possibility for Hp to proliferate and infect the stomach. The higher frequency of Hp infection in underdeveloped countries may perhaps be explained by a higher frequency of gastroenteritis in these countries. The initial infection affects both oxyntic and antral mucosa. We do not know the mechanisms behind the resolution of the initial infection resulting in loss of symptoms and restoration of acid secretion. Nevertheless, it seems that the infection persists in all infected subjects, with some having the ability to limit the infection to the antral mucosa whereas others develop a chronic pan-gastric infection at an early stage.

### Medical management of acid-peptic disorders of the stomach [^0bbddf2d]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

In the past 30 years, medicine has witnessed an unprecedented evolution in acid-peptic disorder management, fueled by major advances in our understanding of the physiology of acid secretion and the gastric mucosal barrier. The other pivotal development in understanding these disorders has been the recognition of Helicobacter pylori's role in the pathophysiology of peptic ulcer disease, chronic gastritis, and even gastric malignancy. This evolution continues as H pylori wanes in significance, and medicine is challenged by treating iatrogenic conditions brought on by ulcerogenic anti-inflammatory drugs. Following a description of the relevant physiology and biochemistry of gastric acid secretion and the gastric mucosal barrier, this article describes the current medicinal arsenal available to treat acid-peptic disorders of the stomach.

Mechanisms of hypoacidity during the initial infection

The course of acute Hp gastritis or epidemic hypochlorhydria, which has been used synonymously, may last for weeks or months. The mechanism behind the reduced gastric acidity in the acute phase of Hp infection is not known, but properties both by Hp itself and the inflammation this infection provokes have been implicated [Figure 1(b)]. Thus, Hp infection may induce the production of cytokines like interleukin (IL)-1β having an inhibitory effect on gastric acid secretion. A direct effect on acid secretion by Hp itself is supported by studies in isolated parietal cells. Among the Hp-derived factors involved in the reduction of gastric acidity during acute infection are NH 3, fatty acids or a substance having inhibitory effects on the H + /K + -ATP-ase. For more than 20 years it has been shown that Hp and fatty acids produced by Hp block H + /K + -ATP-ase and more recently that Hp represses proton-pump expression as well. Some cytokines liberated by the inflammation may also have a profound effect on acid secretion.

### Accessible homeostatic gastric organoids reveal secondary cell type-specific host-pathogen interactions in Helicobacter pylori infections [^37a1dc3f]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Various gastric pathologies, including gastric cancer, are primarily driven by persistent Helicobacter pylori infection and remain a global health concern due to the high prevalence of this bacteria. Upon ingestion, the bacteria colonize the gastric epithelium by attaching to the cell junctions, creating a niche where they remain protected from the harsh acidic stomach environment –. In proximity to cells, H. pylori can persist throughout the lifetime of an infected individual, causing local epithelial damage and inducing inflammation and immune responses. Patients often remain asymptomatic for decades, but infections can eventually progress to peptic ulcers or gastric adenocarcinomas. However, many mechanisms underlying these diseases remain inadequately understood, such as the early interplay between individual bacteria and host cells and the transition from chronic inflammation to malignancy.

These mechanisms elude understanding primarily due to limitations apparent in widely used model systems, as traditional in vitro models fail to replicate the physiological conditions present in the stomach, such as variations in pH levels, mucus production, and/or the diverse differentiation states of gastric epithelial cells. The glandular epithelium of the stomach antrum, the primary site of H. pylori infections, is composed of stem-and early progenitor cells, MUC6 mucin-expressing neck cells, prostaglandin C (PGC)-expressing chief cells and MUC5AC mucin-producing pit cells. Moreover, the antral glands also contain acid-producing parietal cells, however to a much lesser extent than the glands of the corpus, and specialized cell types such as diverse hormone producing enteroendocrine cells (chromogranin A (CHGA)-positive) and Tuft cells. The tissue is organized in a stereotypical manner with the stem- and progenitor cells residing at the bottom of the glands together with neck and chief cells, and the pit cells present towards the surface of the epithelium.

### Structure of the proton-gated urea channel from the gastric pathogen Helicobacter pylori [^bac2d0ac]. Nature (2013). Excellent credibility.

Half the world's population is chronically infected with Helicobacter pylori, causing gastritis, gastric ulcers and an increased incidence of gastric adenocarcinoma. Its proton-gated inner-membrane urea channel, HpUreI, is essential for survival in the acidic environment of the stomach. The channel is closed at neutral pH and opens at acidic pH to allow the rapid access of urea to cytoplasmic urease. Urease produces NH(3) and CO(2), neutralizing entering protons and thus buffering the periplasm to a pH of roughly 6.1 even in gastric juice at a pH below 2.0. Here we report the structure of HpUreI, revealing six protomers assembled in a hexameric ring surrounding a central bilayer plug of ordered lipids. Each protomer encloses a channel formed by a twisted bundle of six transmembrane helices. The bundle defines a previously unobserved fold comprising a two-helix hairpin motif repeated three times around the central axis of the channel, without the inverted repeat of mammalian-type urea transporters. Both the channel and the protomer interface contain residues conserved in the AmiS/UreI superfamily, suggesting the preservation of channel architecture and oligomeric state in this superfamily. Predominantly aromatic or aliphatic side chains line the entire channel and define two consecutive constriction sites in the middle of the channel. Mutation of Trp153 in the cytoplasmic constriction site to Ala or Phe decreases the selectivity for urea in comparison with thiourea, suggesting that solute interaction with Trp153 contributes specificity. The previously unobserved hexameric channel structure described here provides a new model for the permeation of urea and other small amide solutes in prokaryotes and archaea.

### How Helicobacter pylori urease may affect external pH and influence growth and motility in the mucus environment: evidence from in-vitro studies [^9d65559b]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Survival of Helicobacter pylori is dependent upon urease in the cytoplasm and at the bacterial surface. We have sought to clarify how alkaline ammonium salts, released from urea by this enzyme, might alter mucus pH and so affect growth and motility of the bacterium in the gastric mucus environment.

Methods

Experiments were conducted in vitro to determine how the growth and motility of H. pylori are affected by changes in external pH, and how the bacterium, by hydrolysing urea, alters the pH of the bicarbonate buffer that occurs at the gastric mucosal surface. These data were fitted into experimental models that describe how pH varies within the mucus layer in the acid-secreting stomach.

Results

H. pylori was motile between pH 5 and 8, with optimal motility at pH 5. It grew between pH 6 and 8, with optimal growth at pH 6. The bacterium had urease activity between pH 2.7 and 7.4, as evidenced by pH rises in bicarbonate-buffered solutions of urea. Changes in buffer pH were dependent upon initial pH and urea concentration, with the greatest rate of pH change occurring at pH 3. Modelling experiments utilizing these data indicated that (1) in the absence of urease, H. pylori growth and motility in the mucus layer would be restricted severely by low mucus pH in the acid-secreting stomach, and (2) urease will sometimes inhibit H. pylori growth and motility in the mucus layer by elevating the pH of the mucus environment above pH 8.

Conclusions

Urease is essential to the growth and motility of H. pylori in the mucus layer in the acid-secreting stomach, but, paradoxically, sometimes it might suppress colonization by raising the mucus pH above 8. This latter effect may protect the bacteria from the adverse consequences of overpopulation.

### Patients with established gastro-esophageal reflux disease might benefit fromeradication [^218ba1f8]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

The interplay between H. pylori and host factors plays an important role in the pathogenesis of GERD. Specifically, H. pylori may contribute to GERD pathogenesis by several mechanisms including the release of several mediators, cytokines and nitric oxide (NO) which may adversely affect the LES; cause direct damage of the esophageal mucosa by bacterial products; increase production of prostaglandins that sensitize afferent nerves and reduce LES pressure; and augment acidity (by gastrin release) that exacerbates GERD. Specifically, there is the concept that gastric inflammation at the cardia may lower the threshold for transient relaxationof the LES by altering the sensitivity of vagal sensory receptors. H. pylori gastritis is accompanied by release of the abovementioned NO, cytokines and prostaglandins that promote damage to the adjacent esophageal mucosa. There is good evidence to indicate that the excessive production of prostaglandins in reflux esophagitis drives a vicious cycle of LES dysfunction, reflux, mucosal inflammation, aggravated LES dysfunction and further reflux. Moreover, the predominantly antral H. pylori gastritis is associated with an augmented gastrin release; increased acidity along with a higher volumeof gastric juice may aggravate reflux disease. Finally, in a recent critical review regarding the complicated data available on the topic of H. pylori association with GERD, the authors concluded that: Intra-esophageal pH recording data fail to confirm increased acid reflux following H. pylori eradication; esophageal manometric studies suggest that bacterial eradication reduce rather than favor acid reflux into the esophagus; clinical studies suggest that H. pylori eradication is not considerably associated with reflux symptoms or erosive esophagitis onset; and some data also suggest an advantage in curing the infection when esophagitis is already present.

The present series have certain limitations: 1) the sample size, though the biggest in the relevant literature, was rather small, given that even the introduction the 3-h postprandial esophageal pH monitoring is not always easily acceptable by the patients; 2) the missed patients with a persistent H. pylori infection may preclude assessing whether the observed pH-recording modifications are definitely due to the bacterial loss; and 3) only 1 biopsy specimen was used for histology. This is an inadequate sampling protocol for routine endoscopic practice; 5 biopsies (2 antrum, 1 angulus, 2 corpus) being advised by current guidelines for an accurate upper endoscopy. However, due to large number of patient recruitment to find our selected H. pylori positive GERD patients, we were obliged to take only 1 instead of 5 biopsies for many obvious reasons mainly including the time burden of histological evaluation.

Recent milestones in the understanding of gastric acid secretion and treatment of acid-peptic disorders include the (1) discovery of histamine H(2)-receptors and development of histamine H(2)-receptor antagonists, (2) identification of H(+)K(+)-ATPase as the parietal cell proton pump and development of proton pump inhibitors, and (3) identification of Helicobacter pylori as the major cause of duodenal ulcer and development of effective eradication regimens. This review emphasizes the importance and relevance of gastric acid secretion and its regulation in health and disease. We review the physiology and pathophysiology of acid secretion as well as evidence regarding its inhibition in the management of acid-related clinical conditions.

### Helicobacter pylori eradication does not exacerbate gastro-oesophageal reflux disease [^c45fd4ca]. Gut (2004). Low credibility.

The reciprocal influence of Helicobacter pylori infection and gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD), if both conditions occur concomitantly, has been an issue of debate for many years. The critical question is whether eradication of H pylori has a more beneficial, harmful, or simply no effect on the course of GORD.

### PH-regulated gene expression of the gastric pathogen Helicobacter pylori [^fcefba54]. Infection and Immunity (2003). Low credibility.

Colonization by the gastric pathogen Helicobacter pylori has been shown to be intricately linked to the development of gastritis, ulcers, and gastric malignancy. Little is known about mechanisms employed by the bacterium that help it adapt to the hostile environment of the human stomach. In an effort to extend our knowledge of these mechanisms, we utilized spotted-DNA microarrays to characterize the response of H. pylori to low pH. Expression of approximately 7% of the bacterial genome was reproducibly altered by shift to low pH. Analysis of the differentially expressed genes led to the discovery that acid exposure leads to profound changes in motility of H. pylori, as a larger percentage of acid-exposed bacterial cells displayed motility and moved at significantly higher speeds. In contrast to previous publications, we found that expression of the bacterial virulence gene cagA was strongly repressed by acid exposure. Furthermore, this transcriptional repression was reflected at the level of protein accumulation in the H. pylori cell.

### Heartburn risk factors, knowledge, and prevention strategies… [^473fdc79]. JAMA Network (1999). Excellent credibility.

Heartburn occurs when the esophagus is exposed to gastric acid. Ordinarily, the lower esophageal sphincter, which separates the esophagus from the stomach, prevents acid from entering the esophagus. We asked survey respondents to report when they experienced heartburn using a checklist of potential trigger situations. Respondents were allowed to respond to all questions that applied. Heartburn was experienced after or during a broad range of activities and events. Men and women reported heavy meals and high-fat foods, acidic foods, and lying down as causes of heartburn; 23% to 52% of the respondents attributed their heartburn to these situations. Furthermore, smoking and drinking alcoholic beverages were reported less by the older age groups as causes of heartburn. No other important trends were observed. Consumption of fast foods, caffeinated beverages, and alcoholic beverages were reported less by the older age groups as causes of heartburn.

Those with frequent heartburn reported a higher frequency for all the causes of heartburn listed in Table 3 and Table 4. Nearly all the comparisons reached statistical significance. Approaches used to prevent and treat heartburn are presented in Table 7 and Table 8. Forty-five percent of the survey respondents used a nonprescription medication to prevent the onset of heartburn symptoms. Other approaches to heartburn prevention included taking prescription medication and avoiding spicy foods. Women were more likely to take a prescription medication and avoid fatty foods and citrus juices, while men were more likely to do nothing to prevent heartburn. More than 75% of male and female respondents reported taking a nonprescription medication to treat heartburn. Although certain foods and lifestyles have been identified as potential causes of heartburn, most individuals did not report that they modified these behaviors to avoid or prevent heartburn.

Table 9 presents the results of multivariate analyses. Increasing age, higher body mass index, and reduced level of education were statistically significant predictors of frequent vs infrequent heartburn in this study population. Physicians often recommend lifestyle changes in addition to medications to prevent heartburn. Decreasing consumption of spicy foods and caffeinated beverages, for example, has been suggested to improve symptoms. Weight loss is recommended for obese patients. Avoiding the supine position after eating may decrease gastroesophageal reflux and thereby prevent heartburn. The results of this study support these recommendations and show a relationship between certain lifestyle factors and heartburn. Future studies are needed, however, to confirm that behavior modification is useful in preventing and treating heartburn.

### And gastric acid: an intimate and reciprocal relationship [^cc8c8bad]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Hp and hypoacidity/anacidity

During the early phases of oxyntic gastritis caused by Hp, gastric acid secretion may be only moderately reduced and Hp eradication even in patients with some degree of atrophy can augment acid secretion. In patients with pan-gastritis and oxyntic atrophy, Hp may not be detectable. It is presumed that Hp cannot live under these conditions. Hp may have been replaced by other microorganisms which can live in this situation in the stomach, or alternatively, NH 3 production by Hp urease creates a local milieu too alkaline for the agent itself in a stomach without acid. The role of acid for Hp to thrive is also demonstrated by the effects of acid inhibition in combination with antibiotics in eradication of Hp, as well as the possible oral spread in the stomach during treatment with inhibitors of gastric acid secretion. Interestingly, the new inhibitor of gastric acid secretion, vonoprazan, belonging to potassium-competitive acid blockers, and probably more efficient in inhibiting acid secretion than proton-pump blockers, seems to be more efficient in combination with antibiotics in eradicating Hp compared with proton-pump inhibitors.

### RNA atlas of human bacterial pathogens uncovers stress dynamics linked to infection [^00634bae]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Bacterial pathogens with different genetic and physiological features share capacity to sense and respond to external changes in the host by regulating their transcriptome. The responses are often complex, and synergistic regulation of regulatory networks can be pivotal in sensing and adapting different colonization niches during different phases of infection –. For many pathogens, the first environmental change upon infection of mammalian hosts is altered temperature. Bacteria sense changes in temperature through various sensory mechanisms triggering transcriptional changes for adaptation. The heat-shock response that aid in maintaining protein and membrane homeostasis protects bacteria from sudden temperature change. Low pH in the gastrointestinal tract, genital tract, dental plaque, skin, and in phagosomes represents additional stresses. Helicobacter pylori are successful in adaptation to acidic environments capable to colonize the stomach, which mostly relies on enzymatic activities of proteins such as urease leading to the formation of ammonia neutralizing gastric acid. Another agent affecting enteric bacteria is bile salts produced in the liver and secreted to the gastrointestinal tract, as well as secondary bile salts produced by the microbial flora. Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi can resist very high bile concentrations and can persist in gall bladder, where it forms biofilm on gallstones. The hyperosmotic nature of blood and gastrointestinal tract can be harsh for certain pathogens, in some cases also inducing expression of virulence genes, such as in H. pylori and Vibrio cholerae. Limited nutrient, iron, and oxygen levels are other stresses that pathogens encounter in different nishes of the host and have to adapt to for survival. While free sugars are available in the blood, sugar levels can be limited in other infection sites such as respiratory tracts. Here, extracellular glycan hydrolysis is a common strategy for many bacterial pathogens to acquire nutrients. Amino acid starvation can trigger the stringent reponse, mediated by guanosine tetra/pentaphosphate ((p)-ppGpp), which in turn induces stress responses for adaption to nutrient limitation. Iron is insoluble in the aerobic environment and neutral pH of serum, but invading bacteria has developed numerous mechanisms to acquire iron. One acquisition mechanism is the usage of siderophores, molecules that sequester iron and import its cargo to the bacteria through specific transporters such as the TonB/ExbB/ExbD transport system. Besides natural environments of different tissues, the recruitment of immune cells, such as neutrophils and macrophages contributes to environmental changes. When activated, these cells produce toxic oxidative and nitrosative substances that bacteria have to cope with. The toxic substances are sensed by regulatory proteins such as OxyR, DksA, SsrB, OhrR, MosR, SarZ, and MgtA in different pathogens. The activity of the phagocytic immune cells also consumes oxygen and contributes to local hypoxia at the infection site. However, despite many known adaptation mechanisms in diverse human pathogens, there are still mechanisms and synergies between mechanisms to be identified. In addition, other parts remaining to be elucidated are the assisting interconnected regulatory networks including global and specific regulators, which can be complex involving both species-specific and shared mechanisms.

### Mechanisms of increased acid secretion after eradication of Helicobacter pylori infection [^15f6356a]. Gut (2006). Low credibility.

Eradication of Helicobacter pylori infection leads to recovery of gastric acid secretion in some individuals but the mechanism is not fully understood. In the short term, there is an impressive increase in expression of H+/K+-ATPase pumps without an increase in the number of parietal cells. Longer follow up studies are needed to see if the parietal cell mass eventually recovers.

### Roles of alpha and beta carbonic anhydrases of Helicobacter pylori in the urease-dependent response to acidity and in colonization of the murine gastric mucosa [^2761b65a]. Infection and Immunity (2008). Low credibility.

Carbon dioxide occupies a central position in the physiology of Helicobacter pylori owing to its capnophilic nature, the large amounts of carbon dioxide produced by urease-mediated urea hydrolysis, and the constant bicarbonate supply in the stomach. Carbonic anhydrases (CA) catalyze the interconversion of carbon dioxide and bicarbonate and are involved in functions such as CO(2) transport or trapping and pH homeostasis. H. pylori encodes a periplasmic alpha-CA (alpha-CA-HP) and a cytoplasmic beta-CA (beta-CA-HP). Single CA inactivation and double CA inactivation were obtained for five genetic backgrounds, indicating that H. pylori CA are not essential for growth in vitro. Bicarbonate-carbon dioxide exchange rates were measured by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy using lysates of parental strains and CA mutants. Only the mutants defective in the alpha-CA-HP enzyme showed strongly reduced exchange rates. In H. pylori, urease activity is essential for acid resistance in the gastric environment. Urease activity measured using crude cell extracts was not modified by the absence of CA. With intact CA mutant cells incubated in acidic conditions (pH 2.2) in the presence of urea there was a delay in the increase in the pH of the incubation medium, a phenotype most pronounced in the absence of H. pylori alpha-CA. This correlated with a delay in acid activation of the urease as measured by slower ammonia production in whole cells. The role of CA in vivo was examined using the mouse model of infection with two mouse-adapted H. pylori strains, SS1 and X47-2AL. Compared to colonization by the wild-type strain, colonization by X47-2AL single and double CA mutants was strongly reduced. Colonization by SS1 CA mutants was not significantly different from colonization by wild-type strain SS1. However, when mice were infected by SS1 Delta(beta-CA-HP) or by a SS1 double CA mutant, the inflammation scores of the mouse gastric mucosa were strongly reduced. In conclusion, CA contribute to the urease-dependent response to acidity of H. pylori and are required for high-grade inflammation and efficient colonization by some strains.

### Effective and safe proton pump inhibitor therapy in acid-related diseases – A position paper addressing benefits and potential harms of acid suppression [^d5c5838a]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Summary of the current evidence

PPIs represent a key component of any currently adopted regimens for H. pylori eradication. The degree and duration of acid suppression influence the eradication rate. While almost all H. pylori- positive ulcers are cured by H. pylori eradication, H. pylori- negative and NSAID/aspirin-negative PUs need high dose PPIs to be healed and, often, lifelong acid suppression is required to prevent recurrence.

After the discovery by Warren and Marshall of the infectious etiology of PU disease in 1984, several lines of evidence confirmed that H. pylori eradication cures PU disease without the need for subsequent long-term maintenance antisecretory therapy, and can also be beneficial to other H. pylori -related diseases. While previously used only to heal PUs, PPIs have become a key component of all the currently adopted eradication regimens, thus gaining a new role in the management of PU disease.

H. pylori is located within the gastric mucus layer, deep within the mucus-secreting glands of the antrum, attached to cells and even within cells, and is able to survive over a wide pH spectrum. Since the survival capabilities of H. pylori within the stomach make its eradication difficult, several different drug combinations have been developed, with variable and inconsistent success, with no single therapy being effective worldwide. Therefore, the search for a new regimen to treat H. pylori infection still continues today.

An effective therapy should be able to eradicate the organism from each of these potential niches, which is an overwhelming task for any single antibiotic, whose in vitro susceptibility does not necessarily correlate with successful treatment in vivo. Since the very beginning, it was recognized that therapy with a single antibiotic leads to poor cure rates and various recipes were attempted, resulting in several effective combinations of antimicrobials, bismuth, and antisecretory drugs.

### Host-bacterial interactions in Helicobacter pylori infection [^e39a7278]. Gastroenterology (2008). Low credibility.

Helicobacter pylori are spiral-shaped gram-negative bacteria with polar flagella that live near the surface of the human gastric mucosa. They have evolved intricate mechanisms to avoid the bactericidal acid in the gastric lumen and to survive near, to attach to, and to communicate with the human gastric epithelium and host immune system. This interaction sometimes results in severe gastric pathology. H pylori infection is the strongest known risk factor for the development of gastroduodenal ulcers, with infection being present in 60%-80% of gastric and 95% of duodenal ulcers.(1)H pylori is also the first bacterium to be classified as a definite carcinogen by the World Health Organization's International Agency for Research on Cancer because of its epidemiologic relationship to gastric adenocarcinoma and gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma.(2) In the last 25 years, since H pylori was first described and cultured, a complete paradigm shift has occurred in our clinical approach to these gastric diseases, and more than 20,000 scientific publications have appeared on the subject. From the medical point of view, H pylori is a formidable pathogen responsible for much morbidity and mortality worldwide. However, H pylori infection occurs in approximately half of the world population, with disease being an exception rather than the rule. Understanding how this organism interacts with its host is essential for formulating an intelligent strategy for dealing with its most important clinical consequences. This review offers an insight into H pylori host-bacterial interactions.

### Hepcidin is localised in gastric parietal cells, regulates acid secretion and is induced by Helicobacter pylori infection [^77f65e9e]. Gut (2012). Low credibility.

Backgrounds and Aims

Hepcidin is an antimicrobial peptide and the central regulator of iron metabolism. Given that hepcidin was shown to be expressed in a variety of extrahepatic tissues and that stomach plays a role in iron absorption and in defence against infections, this study analysed the importance of hepcidin in the stomach.

Methods

Expression and localisation of gastric hepcidin was studied by quantitative RT-PCR, western blot, immunofluorescence and in situ hybridisation. Regulation of gastric hepcidin expression was analysed both in vitro and in vivo. Hepcidin wild-type (WT) and knockout (KO) animals were used to determine the impact of hepcidin on gastric bacterial overgrowth as well as gastric acid secretion.

Results

Hepcidin was abundantly expressed in the gastric fundus and corpus of all tested species. Treatment of AGS cells with ferric nitrilotriacetate solution downregulated hepcidin expression levels, while desferroxamine, interleukin 6 and Helicobacter pylori infection upregulated it. In humans, gastric hepcidin expression was elevated during H pylori infection and normalised after successful eradication. Gastric hepcidin is localised in parietal cells that are indispensable for gastric acid secretion. Comparisons of WT and hepcidin KO mice revealed that acid secretion in hepcidin-deficient mice is markedly reduced and is associated with gastric bacterial overgrowth, expression changes in multiple factors involved in acid secretion (Atp4a, Cck2r, Gas, Sst and Sst2r) and with reduced circulating gastrin levels. In WT mice, pantoprazole activated and histamine downregulated hepcidin expression levels.

Conclusions

Hepcidin is a product of parietal cells regulating gastric acid production and may contribute to development of gastric ulcers under stress conditions.

### In vivo activation of pH-responsive oxidase-like graphitic nanozymes for selective killing of Helicobacter pylori [^2ed3fc3a]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

H. pylori is a gram-negative microaerobic spiral-shaped bacterium that mainly colonizes in the human stomach and is a major etiological factor in many gastric diseases, such as gastritis, gastric ulcers, and gastric cancer –. It is reported that around 50% of the global population has been infected by H. pylori. Triple therapy, as the standard first-line therapy in the clinical treatment of H. pylori infection, involves a proton pump inhibitor (omeprazole) and two antibiotics (amoxicillin, clarithromycin/metronidazole). However, the insufficient retention time of antibiotics in gastric lumenand the degradation of antibiotics by gastric acidseverely affect the antimicrobial activity of antibiotics. Furthermore, owing to the constant emergence of drug-resistant bacteria, the therapeutic efficacy of triple therapy is also decreased –. In addition, administration of high-dose antibiotics may cause severe side effects for symbiotic bacteria which are closely related to many otherwise beneficial physiological and metabolic processes. Gut microflora dysbiosis is known to result in many diseases. Therefore, it is imperative to develop an alternative therapeutic strategy to selectively treat H. pylori with superior antibacterial efficacy, while also maintaining a healthy balance for the commensal bacteria.

### Association between dietary antioxidant index and risk of Helicobacter pylori infection among adults: a case-control study [^000baa10]. BMC Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Several biologically plausible reasons may explain why dietary antioxidants might be, either directly or indirectly, a protective factor againstH.pylori infection. It is well-known that antioxidants, with their free radical scavenging activities, can inhibit the growth of H. pylori. H. pylori is urease positive and can synthesize a large amount of urease for ammonia production to neutralize the gastric acid, allowing it to colonize in the stomach epithelium. It has been shown that vitamin C inhibits urease activity. Moreover, vitamin C improves the stimulation and activity of granulocytes, macrophages, lymphocytes, and immunoglobulin production. In vitro studies, showed that zinc inhibits the urease enzyme and prevents H.pylori adhesion to gastric mucin. Mucosal inflammation may be required for H. pylori infection to persist, and the anti-inflammatory effects of antioxidants could inhibit H. pylori growth.

### Kyoto global consensus report on Helicobacter pylori gastritis [^b1820189]. Gut (2015). Low credibility.

Comment

H. pylori is a major human pathogen that causes chronic and progressive gastric mucosal damage and is aetiologically related to peptic ulcer, gastric cancer and gastric atrophy. It is also closely associated with gastric MALT lymphoma, dyspepsia, hyperplastic gastric polyps and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura. H. pylori -positive individuals are also the major reservoir for transmission of the infection.

The decision to eradicate a chronic infection in a society should be based on quantitative data regarding the outcome of untreated infections. H. pylori causes a chronic infection, similar, for example, to asymptomatic syphilis or tuberculosis, and the final outcome for any individual cannot be predicted. H. pylori infection differs from many other chronic infectious diseases because it is always transmissible, thus putting others at risk. Because the gastric damage is progressive, the lack of an obvious clinical manifestation at diagnosis has no predictive value for life-time risk to an individual patient, their family or to the community. Benefits of H. pylori eradication for an individual depend in part on the degree and extent of damage that has already occurred and the reversibility of that damage. Potential benefits of eradication include stopping the progression of mucosal damage, stabilisation or reduction in risk of developing gastric cancer, resolution of mucosal inflammation, stabilisation or improvement of gastric mucosal function, return of the normal mechanisms governing acid secretion, cure of H. pylori -related PUD, reduction in risk of gastrointestinal complications of NSAID therapy and prevention of future development of H. pylori -related peptic ulcer.

For society, the benefits include reduction of the reservoir of infected individuals capable of transmitting the infection to others, and avoidance of the costs associated with diagnosis, management and outcomes of H. pylori -related diseases that are prevented. Thus, H. pylori -infected patients should be offered eradication therapy unless there are competing considerations such as comorbidities, re-infection rates in their communities, competing health priorities of society and financial cost. It has to be remembered, however, that there are concerns about the negative impact of eradication therapies on human health, such as increase in allergy or obesity and perturbation of microbiota.

### Bacterial overgrowth and diversification of microbiota in gastric cancer [^30fa7a7f]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2016). Low credibility.

Nitrate/nitrite and their metabolites are associated with a variety of functions. Acidified nitrite is capable of killing bacteria. Nitrate could shape the intestinal microbiota when acting as a source of energy. Nitric oxide, a final product of nitrite reduction, is intensively involved in the protection of mucosal integrity. Importantly, N-nitroso compounds derived from metabolisms of nitrate/nitrite are potent carcinogens. E. coli, Lactobacillus, and Nitrospirae are all known to play a role in the metabolisms of nitrate/nitrite. As the level of nitrate/nitrite increases in the gastric cancer and its precancerous conditions, it could be expected that the production of N-nitroso compounds is possibly enhanced by these bacteria. Thus, these enriched bacteria could participate in the carcinogenesis.

H. pylori is a major risk factor for gastric cancer. The influence of H. pylori on gastric microbiota has not been fully understood. Our findings showed that H. pylori infection was associated with an increased amount of mucosa-associated bacteria. This is possibly caused by changes in the gastric niche induced by H. pylori. Otherwise, it is plausible that H. pylori -infected individuals have a gastric niche favoring bacterial colonization. It has been found that H. pylori had a major impact on the structure of gastric microbiota. This is most likely caused simply by a takeover of other bacteria by H. pylori. When eliminating H. pylori from the analysis of microbiota, the abundance of other bacteria in H. pylori -positive patients does not alter compared with H. pylori -negative individuals. In agreement with this, our study found that the diversity and structure of microbiota altered in H. pylori -infected stomach only when analyses took into account bacterial abundance. These results showed that the major influence of H. pylori on microbiota is the increased amount of bacteria in the stomach.

### AGA clinical practice update on the management of refractory Helicobacter pylori infection: expert review [^ebe421b3]. Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Refractory Helicobacter pylori — host genetics, intragastric pH, and antibiotic pharmacology: Polymorphisms that affect intragastric pH, including CYP2C19, IL-1B, and MDR1, are especially relevant to successful eradication, and H pylori is most susceptible to antibiotics when intragastric pH is between 6 and 8. Some antibiotics, including clarithromycin and amoxicillin, require intragastric acid suppression for maximum efficacy; for gastric pH < 2 the half-lives of amoxicillin and clarithromycin are approximately 15.2 ± 0.3 hours and 1.0 ± 0.04 hours, respectively, whereas for gastric pH > 7 the half-lives of both antibiotics are > 68 hours, explaining why inadequate acid suppression allows persistence despite in vitro susceptibility. Host genetics literature focuses on CYP2C19, the cytochrome P450 gene for metabolism of earlier-generation PPIs, and poor metabolizer phenotypes have high plasma PPI concentrations.

### Coordinated regulation of pH alkalinization by two transcription factors promotes fungal commensalism and pathogenicity [^c324b92e]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Microorganisms are capable of adapting their cells to almost every biological and physicochemical environment. Any deviation from homeostatic conditions can trigger stress reactions in these microbes. Within the spectrum of environmental factors that influence microbial life, pH stands out as one of the most important variables shaping the dynamics of microcosm ecosystems. Changes in pH can induce diverse stresses on cellular functions, including the availability of essential micronutrients, protein functions, and membrane potentials. Importantly, microbes in the human body must adapt to a variety of pHs in different anatomical sites, ranging from acidic human vagina (pH 4.0) to neutral or slightly alkaline blood and tissue (pH 7.4). In particular, pH along the digestive tract varies considerably, ranging from pH 2.0 to 8.0. To survive and grow, microorganisms evolve the ability to rapidly sense and respond to potentially lethal changes in environmental pH, and multiple important signaling pathways are involved. For example, adaptation to extracellular pH is critical for numerous fungal species, primarily mediated by the conserved PacC/Rim101 pathway. Moreover, both bacterial and fungal pathogens have been shown to actively modify, either lowering or raising, the pH of their surrounding environment to support their survival and enhance virulence. Certain pathogenic fungi, such as Sclerotinia sclerotiorum and Aspergillus spp. secrete acids to acidify the environment and damage host tissues –. In contrast, Legionella pneumophila can raise the pH of its phagocytic vacuole, a process that may be critical for the intracellular survival and multiplication of this and other intracellular pathogens. Similarly, the gastric pathogen Helicobacter pylori employs a urease system to neutralize acidic conditions: it produces ammonia, which enables the bacterium to colonize the highly acidic surface of the stomach. Some phytopathogenic fungi, including Alternaria alternat, Colletotrichum gleosporioides, and Fusarium oxysporum, also secrete ammonia to alkalinize the acid environment. Thus, the capacity to modulate environmental pH appears to be a general feature among most microorganisms during their interactions with hosts. However, the precise mechanisms behind pH acidification or alkalinization remain largely unknown in fungi.

### Small RNA mediated gradual control of lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis affects antibiotic resistance in Helicobacter pylori [^860988c7]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is essential for the physiological integrity and functionality of the outer membrane of most Gram-negative bacteria. As a main surface antigen, it also plays an important role in the interaction between bacterial pathogens and their host. LPS is one of the most potent stimulators of the host immune system and its recognition is essential for the host organism to clear bacterial infections. During the course of infection, many pathogens modify their LPS synthesis and structure to adapt to diverse microenvironments and evade recognition by the host's immune system.

Helicobacter pylori is a Gram-negative pathogen that colonizes the stomach of 50% of the world's population, which can lead to peptic ulcer disease and gastric cancer. H. pylori produces a highly modified LPS, unique in both its structure and function, that is essential for establishing colonization and persistence within the human stomach –. Like in most Gram-negative bacteria, H. pylori LPS is composed of lipid A, a core oligosaccharide, and the hypervariable O-specific polysaccharide repeats (O-chain). H. pylori LPS lacks a canonical inner and outer core organization, and was recently reported to have a short core and a longer O-antigen domain, including structures that were previously assigned to the outer core. This long O-antigen comprises a trisaccharide (Trio), a glucan, a DD-heptan, and terminal Lewis antigens. Despite its important roles in immune evasion and persistence, a complete picture of the LPS biosynthesis pathway in H. pylori is only being revealed stepwise. This might be due to the dispersed genomic locations of LPS genes throughout the H. pylori genome.

### Vaccinating against Helicobacter pylori infection [^aa879ad5]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2011). Medium credibility.

Helicobacter pylori infection of the gastric mucosa remains a cause of significant morbidity and mortality almost 30 years after its discovery. H. pylori infection can lead to several gastric maladies, including gastric cancer, and although antimicrobial therapies for the infection exist, the cost of treatment for gastric cancer and the prognosis of individuals who present with this disease make vaccine development a cost effective alternative to bacterial eradication. Experimental mucosal and systemic H. pylori vaccines in mice significantly reduce bacterial load and sometimes provide sterilizing immunity. Clinical trials of oral vaccines consisting of H. pylori proteins with bacterial exotoxin adjuvants or live attenuated bacterial vectors expressing H. pylori proteins induce adaptive immune mechanisms but fail to consistently reduce bacterial load. Clinical trials and murine studies demonstrate that where H. pylori is killed, either spontaneously or following vaccination, the host demonstrated cellular immunity. Improved efficacy of vaccines may be achieved in new trials of vaccine formulations that include multiple antigens and use methods to optimize cellular immunity. Unfortunately, the industrial sponsors that served as the primary engine for much of the previous animal and human research have withdrawn their support. A renewed or expanded commitment from the biotechnology or pharmaceutical industry that could exploit recent advances in our understanding of the host immune response to H. pylori is necessary for the advancement of an H. pylori vaccine.

### A widespread hydrogenase supports fermentative growth of gut bacteria in healthy people [^7a139ee9]. Nature Microbiology (2025). High credibility.

Main

Molecular hydrogen (H 2) is a central intermediate in gastrointestinal digestive processes. Most bacteria within the gut hydrolyse and ferment dietary carbohydrates to absorbable short-chain fatty acids – and large quantities of H 2 gas. H 2 accumulates to high micromolar levels in the gut, where it is primarily consumed by other microorganisms for energy conservation and carbon fixation, although a large proportion is also expelled as flatus or exhaled –. Classically, three groups of gut microorganisms are thought to consume H 2, namely, acetogenic bacteria, methanogenic archaea and sulfate-reducing bacteria. H 2 consumption by gut microorganisms lowers H 2 partial pressures, thereby ensuring fermentation remains thermodynamically favourable. In turn, many H 2 -producing and H 2 -consuming microorganisms form mutualistic relationships by conducting interspecies H 2 transfer dependent on physical association. In addition to supporting digestion, gastrointestinal H 2 cycling modulates levels of important metabolites in the gut, including butyrate, hydrogen sulfide, bile acidsand host steroids, with diverse effects on processes such as digestion, inflammation and carcinogenesis. It is also proposed that microbiota-derived or therapeutically supplied H 2 may directly benefit human cells as an anti-oxidant. Disruption of the balance between H 2 -producing and H 2 -consuming bacteria has been linked to a range of gut and wider disorders; most notably, gas build-up contributes to the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome and hydrogen breath tests are frequently, if controversially, used to detect disorders such as carbohydrate malabsorption –. Numerous pathogens also exploit microbiota-derived H 2 during invasion, including Helicobacter pylori and Salmonella –, or rapidly produce it in the case of pathogenic Clostridia and protists.

A prescription medicine called a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) used to reduce the amount of acid in your stomach.

Esomeprazole magnesium delayed-release capsules are used in adults for:

4 to 8 weeks for the healing and symptom relief of acid-related damage to the esophagus (erosive esophagitis or EE). Your doctor may prescribe another 4 to 8 weeks of esomeprazole magnesium delayed-release capsules in patients whose EE does not heal.
maintaining healing of EE.
4 to 8 weeks to treat heartburn and other symptoms that happen with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).
up to 6 months to reduce the risk of stomach ulcers in some people taking pain medicines called non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).
treating patients with a stomach infection (Helicobacter pylori) and a stomach ulcer, along with the antibiotics amoxicillin and clarithromycin.
the long-term treatment of conditions where your stomach makes too much acid, including Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome. Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome is a rare condition in which the stomach produces a more than normal amount of acid.

### Beyond the gastric epithelium-the paradox of Helicobacter pylori-induced immune responses [^4e9b961b]. Current Opinion in Immunology (2022). Medium credibility.

Chronic infections are typically characterized by an ineffective immune response to the inducing pathogen. While failing to clear the infectious microbe, the provoked inflammatory processes may cause severe tissue damage culminating in functional impairment of the affected organ. The human pathogen Helicobacter pylori is a uniquely successful Gram-negative microorganism inhabiting the gastric mucosa in approximately 50% of the world's population. This bacterial species has evolved spectacular means of evading immune surveillance and influencing host immunity, leading to a fragile equilibrium between proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory signals, the breakdown of which can have serious consequences for the host, including gastric ulceration and cancer. This review highlights novel insights into this delicate interaction between host and pathogen from an immunological perspective.

Hp and gastric cancer

As previously stated, gastric cancer seldom develops in a stomach without gastritis. Similarly, Hp is an accepted cause of gastric cancer. It is also well known that Hp gastritis, when affecting the antrum only, predisposes to duodenal ulcer, which rarely occurs together with gastric cancer. First when Hp has induced an atrophic gastritis in the oxyntic mucosa, there is an increased risk of gastric cancer. The central role of oxyntic mucosal atrophy in gastric carcinogenesis has previously been shown. All together, these facts suggest that the carcinogenic effect of Hp infection is related to the oxyntic atrophy and not directly to the inflammation or the agent itself [Figure 1(e)]. This view is also supported by the long unsuccessful search for a carcinogenic factor in Hp. Hp strains differ in their expression of certain genes; cytotoxin-associated gene A (CagA) and vacuolating cytotoxin A (VacA). Particularly, CagA has been implicated in gastric carcinogenesis. However, even the carcinogenic effect of CagA cannot be separated from its effect on inflammation, gastric acidity and gastrin in blood. In general, the role of virulence factors associated to Hp were reviewed some years ago. Oxyntic mucosal atrophy leads to hypoacidity with secondary microbiological intragastric changes. If changes in gastric milieu should be the cause of Hp-induced gastric cancer, it is strange that patients with so-called 'autoimmune' gastritis affecting only the oxyntic mucosa develop cancers in the oxyntic area. Oxyntic atrophy also leads to hypergastrinemia as a consequence of gastric hypoacidity, and we have previously implicated gastrin in Hp-induced gastric carcinogenesis. The target cell of gastrin, the ECL cell, is regulated functionally and trophically by gastrin. The role of the ECL cell in gastric carcinogenesis seems hitherto to have been greatly underestimated. The two types of gastric cancer according to Lauren, the intestinal and diffuse types, seem to represent separate entities since they do not transform into each other. The ECL cell may be the cell of origin for the diffuse carcinomas. Lack of E-cadherin is an important factor in the pathogenesis of diffuse gastric carcinomas, and interestingly, we did not find E-cadherin expression even in normal ECL cells. Hp infection plays a central role in the pathogenesis of both types, although metaplasia is mainly associated to the intestinal type. In any ways, hypergastrinemia has been shown to be implicated in Hp-associated gastric carcinogenesis. A central role of gastrin in Hp-induced gastric carcinogenesis is also supported by animal studies. Very recently it was reported that Hp could infect deep into the glands and reach the stem cell area. Such deep localization of Hp was mainly found in the antral area, whereas the oxyntic area seems to be mostly involved in Hp-induced gastric carcinogenesis. Moreover, in contrast to virus bacteria, it has hitherto not been shown to have a direct carcinogenic effect.

### AGA clinical practice update on the management of refractory Helicobacter pylori infection: expert review [^669dd414]. Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Adjunctive and novel therapies (BPA #12) — The addition of clavulanic acid to amoxicillin-based regimens has been associated with a 10% to 20% increase in eradication success. To date, at least 20 clinical trials and several meta-analyses have evaluated the effect of probiotics on H pylori eradication, with mostly positive findings but significant trial heterogeneity and quality concerns. Collectively, there are limited data to guide timing, formulation, dosage, duration, and patient selection for these adjunctive therapies, and therefore they should therefore be considered experimental, while development of newer antimicrobial agents against H pylori should be fostered amid the exorbitant cost associated with treatment failure, which is estimated to be at least $33 billion in the United States alone.

### Omeprazole, clarithromycin, amoxicillin (omeclamox-pak) [^7bb1df60]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

12.4 Microbiology

Mechanism of Action

Omeprazole, an antisecretory drug with the substituted benzimidazoles, suppresses gastric acid secretion by specific inhibition of the H+/K+ ATPase enzyme system at the secretory surface of the gastric parietal cell. Because this enzyme system is regarded as the acid (proton) pump within the gastric mucosa, omeprazole has been characterized as a gastric acid-pump inhibitor, in that it blocks the final step of acid production. This effect is dose-dependent and leads to inhibition of both basal and stimulated acid secretion irrespective of the stimulus. Omeprazole can also exhibit anti-bacterial activity depending on the culture conditions. Animal studies indicate that after rapid disappearance from plasma, omeprazole can be found within the gastric mucosa for a day or more.

Clarithromycin exerts its antibacterial activity by binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit of susceptible microorganisms resulting in inhibition of protein synthesis.

Amoxicillin acts through the inhibition of biosynthesis of cell wall mucopeptide.

Triple therapy with omeprazole, clarithromycin and amoxicillin has been shown to be active against most strains of Helicobacter pylori in vitro and in clinical infections as indicated [see Indications and Usage (1)].

Interactions with Other Antibacterial Drugs

In vitro studies show that chloramphenicol, macrolides, sulfonamides, and tetracyclines may interfere with bactericidal effects of penicillin; however, the clinical significance of this interaction is not well documented.

Drug Resistance

Helicobacter pylori Pretreatment Resistance

Clarithromycin pretreatment resistance rates were 9.3% (41/439) in omeprazole/clarithromycin/amoxicillin triple therapy studies [see Clinical Studies (14.1)].

Amoxicillin pretreatment susceptible isolates (≤ 0.25 μg/mL) were found in 99.3% (436/439) of the patients in the omeprazole/clarithromycin/amoxicillin triple therapy studies [see Clinical Studies (14)].)

Effects on Gastrointestinal Microbial Ecology:

Decreased gastric acidity due to any means including proton pump inhibitors, increases gastric counts of bacteria normally present in the gastrointestinal tract. Treatment with proton pump inhibitors may lead to slightly increased risk of gastrointestinal infections such as Salmonella and Campylobacter.

### Coupled amino acid deamidase-transport systems essential for Helicobacter pylori colonization [^5063ea9a]. Infection and Immunity (2010). Low credibility.

In addition to their classical roles as carbon or nitrogen sources, amino acids can be used for bacterial virulence, colonization, or stress resistance. We found that original deamidase-transport systems impact colonization by Helicobacter pylori, a human pathogen associated with gastric pathologies, including adenocarcinoma. We demonstrated that l-asparaginase (Hp-AnsB) and gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase (Hp-gammaGT) are highly active periplasmic deamidases in H. pylori, producing ammonia and aspartate or glutamate from asparagine and glutamine, respectively. Hp-GltS was identified as a sole and specialized transporter for glutamate, while aspartate was exclusively imported by Hp-DcuA. Uptake of Gln and Asn strictly relies on indirect pathways following prior periplasmic deamidation into Glu and Asp. Hence, in H. pylori, the coupled action of periplasmic deamidases with their respective transporters enables the acquisition of Glu and Asp from Gln and Asn, respectively. These systems were active at neutral rather than acidic pH, suggesting their function near the host epithelial cells. We showed that Hp-DcuA, the fourth component of these novel deamidase-transport systems, was as crucial as Hp-gammaGT, Hp-AnsB, and Hp-GltS for animal model colonization. In conclusion, the pH-regulated coupled amino acid deamidase-uptake system represents an original optimized system that is essential for in vivo colonization of the stomach environment by H. pylori. We propose a model in which these two nonredundant systems participate in H. pylori virulence by depleting gastric or immune cells from protective amino acids such as Gln and producing toxic ammonia close to the host cells.

### CagA and cag type IV secretion system activity have key roles in triggering gastric transcriptional and proteomic alterations [^209d95d7]. Infection and Immunity (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Approximately half of the human population are colonized with the bacterium Helicobacter pylori. Though most of these infections are asymptomatic, H. pylori infection can lead to gastric or duodenal ulcers, gastric adenocarcinoma, or gastric lymphoma. Colonization by H. pylori is the primary risk factor for the development of gastric adenocarcinoma, which is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality globally. Therefore, H. pylori has been classified as a Group 1 carcinogen.

Within the stomach, H. pylori can colonize multiple niches. For example, H. pylori can colonize two different regions of the stomach (corpus and antrum). The corpus, also known as the body of the stomach, contains specialized epithelial cells that secrete stomach acid (parietal cells) and digestive enzymes (chief cells). The antrum contains specialized G and D cells that influence gastric acid secretion by parietal cells. Within both the antrum and the corpus, H. pylori populations can be detected in both the superficial gastric mucus and within gastric glands.

The outcome of H. pylori infection is influenced by many factors, including H. pylori genetic variation, host genetic variation, and diet. One of the H. pylori strain-specific features widely recognized as a determinant of clinical outcome is a ~40 kb chromosomal region known as the cag pathogenicity island (PAI). The cag PAI is present in about 50%–60% of clinical isolates from the United States. The proportion of clinical isolates containing the cag PAI is substantially higher in East Asia and several other parts of the world, compared to the United States. Epidemiologic studies have shown that gastric colonization with cag PAI-positive strains of H. pylori is associated with increased gastric cancer risk compared to colonization with cag PAI-negative strains. The cag PAI encodes components of the Cag type IV secretion system (T4SS) and the secreted effector protein CagA, which has been designated as a bacterial oncoprotein. The Cag T4SS delivers CagA, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) metabolites (such as ADP-heptose), peptidoglycan, and bacterial DNA into host cells. CagA interacts with multiple host cell proteins, leading to changes in cell signaling. CagA null mutant strains retain the ability to activate NF-kB and stimulate IL-8 production in gastric epithelial cells, which is attributable to Cag T4SS-dependent delivery of LPS metabolites or peptidoglycan into host cells.

### Vonoprazan fumarate and amoxicillin (Voquezna DUAL PAK) [^3fa07deb]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.4 Microbiology

Mechanism of Action

Amoxicillin is similar to penicillin in its bactericidal action against susceptible bacteria during the stage of active multiplication. It acts through the inhibition of cell wall biosynthesis that leads to the death of the bacteria.

Clarithromycin exerts its antibacterial activity by binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit of susceptible bacteria resulting in inhibition of protein synthesis.

Resistance

Resistance to amoxicillin is mediated primarily through enzymes called beta-lactamases that cleave the beta-lactam ring of amoxicillin, rendering it inactive.

The major routes of clarithromycin resistance are modification of the 23S rRNA in the 50S ribosomal subunit to insensitivity or drug efflux pumps. Beta-lactamase production should have no effect on clarithromycin activity.

If H. pylori is not eradicated after treatment with clarithromycin-containing combination regimens, patients may develop clarithromycin resistance in H. pylori isolates. Therefore, for patients who fail therapy, clarithromycin susceptibility testing should be done, if possible.

Antimicrobial Activity

Culture and sensitivity testing of bacteria are not routinely performed to establish the diagnosis of H. pylori infection [see Clinical Studies (14)]. The following in vitro data are available, but their clinical significance is unknown. Clarithromycin and amoxicillin are active in vitro against most isolates of H. pylori.

Susceptibility Testing

For specific information regarding susceptibility test interpretive criteria and associated test methods and quality control standards recognized by FDA for this drug, please see: https://www.fda.gov/STIC.

Effects on Gastrointestinal Microbial Ecology

Decreased gastric acidity due to any means, increases gastric counts of bacteria normally present in the gastrointestinal tract. Vonoprazan decreases gastric acidity, VOQUEZNA TRIPLE PAK or VOQUEZNA DUAL PAK may lead to a slightly increased risk of gastrointestinal infections due to pathogens such as Salmonella and Campylobacter and, in hospitalized patients, possibly also due to C. difficile.

### Heartburn requiring frequent antacid use may indicate significant illness… [^aea5ecd8]. JAMA Network (1998). Excellent credibility.

Heartburn frequency during the previous year. Heartburn severity during the previous year. Secondary symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease. Alarm symptoms are marked with an asterisk. Results of 24-hour pH monitoring. Background Many otherwise healthy individuals with episodic heartburn self-medicate with over-the-counter antacids. We evaluated clinical characteristics of subjects who had never been medically diagnosed as having any upper gastrointestinal tract disorder and who used antacids for symptomatic relief of heartburn. The remaining 155 eligible subjects had heartburn for an average of 11 years. Forty-seven percent had daily symptoms and 70% described heartburn severity as moderate, even though on endoscopy most had normal-appearing esophageal mucosa. Esophageal acid sensitivity was present in 86% of subjects.

Mean lower esophageal sphincter pressures and esophageal contractile amplitudes were at the lower limits of normal and total esophageal acid contact time was slightly increased. Heartburn was experienced for a mean of 11 years. Heartburn history and characteristics are shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2. Seventy percent described moderately severe heartburn during the previous year, and 23% described severe heartburn. Forty-seven percent had daily heartburn during the previous year. Fifty-six percent described heartburn that worsened with the use of caffeine. Our findings support the results of a small earlier study of frequent antacid users in a Department of Veterans Affairs setting that demonstrated erosive esophagitis in more than half of those with heartburn and positive acid perfusion test results in 90%.

6 Our results also support findings from a large European multicenter study in primary care settings of clinical features and endoscopic diagnoses in 806 subjects with refluxlike symptoms. 7 Similar to 93% of our subjects, 90% of the Europeans rated their heartburn as moderate to severe. In summary, most individuals with occasional mild heartburn can be adequately and safely treated with lifestyle modifications and OTC medications including antacids and low-dose histamine2-receptor antagonists. However, long-term heartburn may warrant full medical examination to exclude important underlying pathological conditions and select appropriate treatment. The results of the current study in long-term users of antacids show that heartburn and other GERD symptoms may not be the trivial problem suggested by some consumer advertising. Physicians should understand that frequent and persistent GERD symptoms might reflect important gastrointestinal pathological features.

Esomeprazole strontium can have other serious side effects. See "What are the possible side effects of esomeprazole strontium?"

What is esomeprazole strontium?

Esomeprazole strontium is a prescription medicine called a proton pump inhibitor (PPI).

Esomeprazole strontium reduces the amount of acid in your stomach.

Esomeprazole strontium is used in adults:

for 4 to 8 weeks to treat the symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Esomeprazole strontium may also be prescribed to heal acid-related damage to the lining of the esophagus (erosive esophagitis), and to help continue this healing.

GERD happens when acid in your stomach backs up into the tube (esophagus) that connects your mouth to your stomach. This may cause a burning feeling in your chest or throat, sour taste, or burping.
for up to 6 months to reduce the risk of stomach ulcers in some people taking pain medicines called non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
to treat patients with a stomach infection (Helicobacter pylori), along with the antibiotics amoxicillin and clarithromycin
for the long-term treatment of conditions where your stomach makes too much acid, including Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome. Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome is a rare condition in which the stomach produces a more than normal amount of acid.

Diagnostic testing — medication effects and pre-test management is labeled "GRADE: strong recommendation. Quality of evidence: moderate. Agreement: 100%". Parents or guardians should be asked about drug intake, that is, antibiotics and PPIs and bismuth salts during the 4 weeks before testing, because antibiotics and bismuth salts may suppress bacterial growth and may result in false-negative test results in all applied diagnostic methods. If acid suppressive therapy cannot be discontinued for 2 weeks because of recurrence of symptoms, changing to an H2-receptor antagonist with discontinuation of the drug 2 days before testing may improve the sensitivity of the diagnostic test, and antacids do not affect UBT and SAT performances.

### Gastric metabolomics detects Helicobacter pylori correlated loss of numerous metabolites in both the corpus and antrum [^09336e8c]. Infection and Immunity (2021). Medium credibility.

Helicobacter pylori is a chronic bacterial pathogen that thrives in several regions of the stomach, causing inflammation that can vary by site and result in distinct disease outcomes. Whether the regions differ in terms of host-derived metabolites is not known. We thus characterized the regional variation of the metabolomes of mouse gastric corpus and antrum organoids and tissue. The uninfected secreted organoid metabolites differed between the corpus and antrum in only seven metabolites as follows: lactic acid, malic acid, phosphoethanolamine, alanine, uridine, glycerol, and isoleucine. Several of the secreted chemicals were depleted upon H. pylori infection in both regions, including urea, cholesterol, glutamine, fumaric acid, lactic acid, citric acid, malic acid, and multiple nonessential amino acids. These results suggest a model in which H. pylori preferentially uses carboxylic acids and amino acids in complex environments, and these are found in both the corpus and antrum. When organoid metabolites were compared to mouse tissue, there was little overlap. The tissue corpus and antrum metabolomes were distinct, including antrum-elevated 5-methoxytryptamine, lactic acid, and caprylic acid, and corpus-elevated phospholipid products. The corpus and antrum remained distinct over an 8-month infection time course. The antrum displayed no significant changes between the time points in contrast to the corpus, which exhibited metabolite changes that were consistent with stress, tissue damage, and depletion of key nutrients, such as glutamine and fructose-6-phosphate. Overall, our results suggest that the corpus and antrum have largely but not completely overlapping metabolomes that change moderately upon H. pylori infection.

### Infection [^808078b3]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2019). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on Helicobacter pylori infection:

- **Definition**: H. pylori is a Gram-negative bacterium that causes chronic infection and inflammation of the stomach and duodenum.
- **Pathophysiology**: H. pylori infection is transmitted via the fecal-oral and oral-oral routes; horizontal transmission, and environmental transmission through contaminated water also occurs.
- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of H. pylori infection in North America is decreasing over time but remains substantial at 30–40%. The infection is typically acquired in childhood and is more prevalent among non-White races and ethnicities, those living in crowded or poor sanitary conditions, and early-generation immigrants from countries where H. pylori is endemic. H. pylori resistance rates to antibiotics are increasing in most parts of the world.
- **Disease course**: H. pylori infection is associated with an increased risk of various gastrointestinal diseases including functional dyspepsia, gastritis, peptic ulcer disease, gastric intestinal metaplasia, and gastric cancer.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Although successful eradication of H. pylori infection prevents the development and progression of H. pylori-associated diseases, the efficacy of treatment regimens has decreased due to increased antibiotic resistance. Globally, the annual recurrence, reinfection, and recrudescence rate of H. pylori is 4.3%, 3.1%, and 2.2%, respectively.

### In vivo activation of pH-responsive oxidase-like graphitic nanozymes for selective killing of Helicobacter pylori [^d0b8bb5e]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

After 2 weeks of inoculation, the H. pylori -infected mice were divided into three groups (n = 6) and intragastrically administered with DPBS, PtCo@G@CPB and triple therapy OAC (omeprazole, amoxicillin, and clarithromycin) once a day for 4 days, respectively. On each day of treatment, mice received proton pump inhibitor (omeprazole) 30 min before intragastric administration of antibiotic to neutralize gastric acid and prevent potential antibiotic degradation. Mice treated with PtCo@G@CPB showed bactericidal efficacy in the stomach similar to that of triple therapy OAC, with bacterial burden decreasing in the stomach 100-fold over that of the control group (treated with DPBS) (Fig. 4d). Gram staining of H. pylori -infected mice gastric tissue treated with DPBS, PtCo@G@CPB, and OAC, respectively, was also investigated (Fig. 4e). Compared with the control group, the Gram staining of gastric tissue treated with PtCo@G@CPB indicated no obvious bacterial presence in the stomach, similar to that of the OAC group. All these results indicated that the PtCo@G@CPB nanozymes were effectively activated in the stomach and demonstrated superior H. pylori killing capability in vivo.

### Peptic ulcer disease today [^0ad44e43]. Nature Clinical Practice: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2006). Medium credibility.

Over the past few decades, since the introduction of histamine H(2)-receptor antagonists, proton-pump inhibitors, cyclo-oxygenase-2-selective anti-inflammatory drugs (coxibs), and eradication of Helicobacter pylori infection, the incidence of peptic ulcer disease and ulcer complications has decreased. There has, however, been an increase in ulcer bleeding, especially in elderly patients. At present, there are several management issues that need to be solved: how to manage H. pylori infection when eradication failure rates are high; how best to prevent ulcers developing and recurring in nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) and aspirin users; and how to treat non-NSAID, non-H. pylori-associated peptic ulcers. Looking for H. pylori infection, the overt or surreptitious use of NSAIDs and/or aspirin, and the possibility of an acid hypersecretory state are important diagnostic considerations that determine the therapeutic approach. Combined treatment with antisecretory therapy and antibiotics for 1–2 weeks is the first-line choice for H. pylori eradication therapy. For patients at risk of developing an ulcer or ulcer complications, it is important to choose carefully which anti-inflammatory drugs, nonselective NSAIDs or coxibs to use, based on a risk assessment of the patient, especially if the high-risk patient also requires aspirin. Testing for and eradicating H. pylori infection in patients is recommended before starting NSAID therapy, and for those currently taking NSAIDs, when there is a history of ulcers or ulcer complications. Understanding the pathophysiology and best treatment strategies for non-NSAID, non-H. pylori-associated peptic ulcers presents a challenge.

### Lansoprazole (Prevacid soluTab) [^f4e13ff0]. FDA (2011). Low credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

PREVACID (lansoprazole) belongs to a class of antisecretory compounds, the substituted benzimidazoles, that suppress gastric acid secretion by specific inhibition of the (H+, K+)-ATPase enzyme system at the secretory surface of the gastric parietal cell. Because this enzyme system is regarded as the acid (proton) pump within the parietal cell, lansoprazole has been characterized as a gastric acid-pump inhibitor, in that it blocks the final step of acid production. This effect is dose-related and leads to inhibition of both basal and stimulated gastric acid secretion irrespective of the stimulus. Lansoprazole does not exhibit anticholinergic or histamine type-2 antagonist activity.

Antisecretory Activity: After oral administration, lansoprazole was shown to significantly decrease the basal acid output and significantly increase the mean gastric pH and percent of time the gastric pH was greater than 3 and greater than 4. Lansoprazole also significantly reduced meal-stimulated gastric acid output and secretion volume, as well as pentagastrin-stimulated acid output. In patients with hypersecretion of acid, lansoprazole significantly reduced basal and pentagastrin-stimulated gastric acid secretion. Lansoprazole inhibited the normal increases in secretion volume, acidity and acid output induced by insulin.

The intragastric pH results of a five-day, pharmacodynamic, crossover study of 15 mg and 30 mg of once daily lansoprazole are presented in Table 4:

After the initial dose in this study, increased gastric pH was seen within 1 to 2 hours with 30 mg of lansoprazole and 2 to 3 hours with 15 mg of lansoprazole. After multiple daily dosing, increased gastric pH was seen within the first hour post-dosing with 30 mg of lansoprazole and within 1 to 2 hours post-dosing with 15 mg of lansoprazole.

Acid suppression may enhance the effect of antimicrobials in eradicating Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori). The percentage of time gastric pH was elevated above 5 and 6 was evaluated in a crossover study of PREVACID given daily, twice daily and three times daily (Table 5).

The inhibition of gastric acid secretion as measured by intragastric pH gradually returned to normal over two to four days after multiple doses. There was no indication of rebound gastric acidity.

### Helicobacter pylori initiates successful gastric colonization by utilizing L-lactate to promote complement resistance [^54c82271]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Another finding reported in this work is the expansion of our knowledge of how H. pylori utilizes lactate. Lactate utilization supports microbial infection in various ways, including both as a growth substrate and for other reasons. For example, Salmonella Typhimurium utilizes L-lactate as a nutrient during gut infection. Neisseria, another example, utilizes lactate to promote complement resistance, as we show for H. pylori. However, key differences exist between these two bacterial systems. N. meningitidis utilizes lactate to evade alternative pathway activation by stimulating the sialic acid biosynthesis pathway to robustly recruit Factor H, which facilitates Factor I to cleave C3b. In H. pylori, L-lactate did not promote H. pylori LPS sialylation from our preliminary investigation, but exclusively mediated classical pathway defense by promoting the removal of C4b. One atypical aspect of H. pylori is that it has duplicated lctP genes (lctP1 and lctP2) on the H. pylori genome. Overall, these findings indicate a divergent bacterial environmental adaptation from a common nutrient acquisition origin.

The mechanism that connects lactate to the anti-complement response in H. pylori is not yet clear. Results presented here show that H. pylori promotes lactate production in the stomach. The source of lactate is not yet known, but many fast growing cells, including epithelial cells, glandular stem cells, and activated phagocytic cells, are able to produce lactate and potentially impact local lactate concentration –. One idea is that H. pylori survives and colonizes the local niches where lactate is relatively abundant. An important observation that supports this idea is that H. pylori colonizes the progenitor and stem cells compartments and stimulates Lgr5 + stem cell proliferation. Stem cells feature a high glycolytic rate compared to more differentiated cells, and likely produce more lactate.

More than half of the world's population is infected with H. pylori, which causes a series of gastric diseases. Treatment relies on "triple-therapy", consisting of two antibiotics and a proton pump inhibitor. There are increasing reports about antibiotic resistance, such that H. pylori has been placed on the WHO's global priority list of antibiotic resistant organisms. Our study strongly indicates that L-lactate utilization is tightly intertwined with H. pylori colonization, beyond use as a carbon source. Thus, we envision therapeutics that might block lactate uptake, and in turn result in robust complement-mediated elimination of H. pylori.

Non- Helicobacter pylori bacterial overgrowth

Acid suppression of PPIs can lead to both luminal and mucosal non- H. pylori bacterial overgrowth in the stomach that may exacerbate chronic inflammation. It has been shown that non- H. pylori bacterial overgrowth is a risk factor for atrophic gastritis (antrum: RR 5.07; 95% CI 1.05–24.40; corpus: RR 6.38; 95% CI 0.78–53.89). The simultaneous infection with H. pylori and non- H. pylori bacteria has a synergistic effect on inducing a higher level of serum cytokines [interleukin (IL)-1 beta and IL-8] and increasing the risk of atrophic gastritis. Moreover, there is an increase in the number of bacteria including nongastric microorganisms (mainly from oral flora) that possess nitrate reductase to produce N-nitroso compounds from food nitrates, known gastric carcinogens. Interestingly, it has been shown that gastric microbiota alteration is distinct in atrophic gastritis.PPI users showed similarly high gastric microbial diversity as healthy subjects. A relatively high gastric microbial diversity, dominated by streptococcus, was observed in autoimmune gastritis, while a decreased microbial abundance and diversity was induced by H. pylori infection.

### In vivo activation of pH-responsive oxidase-like graphitic nanozymes for selective killing of Helicobacter pylori [^d5cbb461]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

In vivo activation of PtCo@G@CPB for selective treatment of H. pylori

The in vivo bactericidal capabilities of PtCo@G@CPB were then investigated. As illustrated in Fig. 3, under an acidic gastric condition, PtCo@G@CPB could catalyze ROS formation, resulting in high local ROS concentration around the bacterial membrane and showing excellent antibacterial efficiency. However, after entering neutral intestinal conditions, the oxidase-like activity of PtCo@G@CPB would be suppressed, allowing for its biocompatibility with symbiotic intestinal bacteria.

The schematic of selective sterilization of H. pylori in vivo based on PtCo@G@CPB nanozyme.

In the acidic stomach condition, the PtCo@G@CPB nanozyme could specifically target H. pylori and catalyze ROS formation, showing significantly enhanced antibacterial efficacy. After entering neutral intestinal condition, the oxidase-like activity of PtCo@G@CPB would be suppressed, and it showed minimal toxicity towards commensal bacteria.

### Probiotics as the live microscopic fighters against Helicobacter pylori gastric infections [^e5d03e43]. BMC Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Probiotics as antibiotics

Scientific studies have shown that probiotics can also act as antibiotic-producing bacteria, and are able to contain the growth of H. pylori by producing antimicrobial substances. Streptomyces spp. are the largest antibiotic-producing probiotics; these bacteria produce a large number of antibiotics such as streptomycin, chloramphenicol, tetracycline, kanamycin, vancomycin, cycloserine, lincomycin, neomycin, cephalosporins, clavulanic acid. Moreover, bacitracin as an effective antibiotic on peptidoglycan of Gram-positive bacteria is produced by B. licheniformis and some strains of B. subtilis.

Short-chain fatty acids produced by probiotics such as acetic acid, propionic acid, and lactic acid can lower the pH of the environment, leading to unfavorable gastric conditions for H. pylori. Bacteriocins (antibacterial peptides) are other properties of probiotics that in turn have antagonistic activity against the survival of H. pylori. Coconnier et al. first found that the supernatant fluid from Lactobacillus acidophilus LB significantly could reduce the viability of H. pylori. In a clinical trial study, Michetti et al. showed that oral administration of culture supernatant fluid of L. acidophilus strain La1 had anti- H. pylori activity. In later years, discovered that this property was due to antimicrobial nisin A. Bacteriocins are a heterogeneous group of antimicrobial proteins that are mostly produced by lactic acid bacteria. Although studies on the effects of bacteriocin-like compounds against H. pylori are limited, bacteriocins with anti- H. pylori activity are produced by some probiotic genera such as Pediococcus, Lactococcus, Bacillus, Weissella, and Bifidobacterium. Bacteriocins reduce or inhibit the growth of H. pylori by a variety of mechanisms including, inducing pores in membrane, activating of autolytic enzymes, and downregulating expression of vacA, cagA, luxS, and flaA genes. In other study, Boyanova et al. introduced seven bacteriocins from L. bulgaricus that were able to kill both antibiotic-susceptible and-resistant bacteria. However, although bacteriocins have been proposed as a new alternative to drug-resistant H. pylori strains, these antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are strain-specific and are also sensitive to gastrointestinal enzymes.

### AGA clinical practice update on the management of refractory Helicobacter pylori infection: expert review [^029048a9]. Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

AGA Clinical Practice Update — Best Practice Advice 8–11 for refractory H pylori infection state that longer treatment durations provide greater eradication success than shorter durations (eg, 14 days vs 7 days) and whenever possible longer durations should be selected. In some cases there should be shared decision making regarding ongoing attempts to eradicate H pylori, weighing benefits against adverse effects and inconvenience of repeated exposure to antibiotics and high-dose acid suppression. With confirmed patient adherence, H pylori susceptibility testing should be considered to guide selection of subsequent regimens. Compiling local data on eradication success rates for each regimen and relevant patient factors is important, and aggregated data should be made publicly available to guide local selection of therapy.

### Phase variation in the Helicobacter pylori phospholipase A gene and its role in acid adaptation [^e16f3835]. Infection and Immunity (2001). Low credibility.

Previously, we have shown that Helicobacter pylori can spontaneously and reversibly change its membrane lipid composition, producing variants with low or high content of lysophospholipids. The "lyso" variant contains a high percentage of lysophospholipids, adheres better to epithelial cells, and releases more proteins such as urease and VacA, compared to the "normal" variant, which has a low content of lysophospholipids. Prolonged growth of the normal variant at pH 3.5, but not under neutral conditions, leads to enrichment of lyso variant colonies, suggesting that the colony switch is relevant to acid adaptation. In this study we show that the change in membrane lipid composition is due to phase variation in the pldA gene. A change in the (C) tract length of this gene results in reversible frameshifts, translation of a full-length or truncated pldA, and the production of active or inactive outer membrane phospholipase A (OMPLA). The role of OMPLA in determining the colony morphology was confirmed by the construction of an OMPLA-negative mutant. Furthermore, variants with an active OMPLA were able to survive acidic conditions better than variants with the inactive form. This explains why the lyso variant is selected at low pH. Our studies demonstrate that phase variation in the pldA gene, resulting in an active form of OMPLA, is important for survival under acidic conditions. We also demonstrated the active OMPLA genotype in fresh isolates of H. pylori from patients referred to gastroscopy for dyspepsia.

### Citric acid anhydrous and 13c urea (IDkit HP ONE) [^11d5420a]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

SECTION 7. INSTRUMENTS

The BreathID®non-invasive breath test is a diagnostic test that analyzes a breath sample before and after ingestion of13C-enriched urea; it is used to identify those patients with H. pylori infection. The samples need to be tested with the BreathID®Hp Lab System or the BreathID® Smart System. For detailed information on the BreathID®System, reference the Operator's Manual supplied with the BreathID®System.

7.1 USE AND FUNCTION OF BREATHID®HP LAB AND BREATHID®SMART SYSTEMS

The BreathID®Hp Lab System or the BreathID®Smart System is intended for use to non-invasively measure changes in the 13CO2/12CO2 ratio of exhaled breath, which may be indicative of increased urease production associated with active Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection in the stomach.

The BreathID®Hp Lab System or the BreathID®Smart System is indicated for use as an aid in the initial diagnosis and post treatment monitoring of H. pylori infection in adult patients and pediatric patients ages 3–17 years old.

7.2 PRINCIPLE OF OPERATION

The BreathID®breath test is performed as follows: a 75mg13C-urea tablet and 4.3g Citrica Powder are dissolved in water and the resulting solution is ingested by the patient. The presence of the Citrica creates an acidic environment in the stomach and also delays the transfer of the ingested solution to the duodenum. These two characteristics facilitate the decomposition of the urea by H. pylori, if present. The13CO2is absorbed into the blood and then exhaled in the breath. Absorption and distribution of13CO2is fast. Therefore, the cleavage of urea by the H. pylori urease that produces the13CO2occurs immediately after the solution is ingested and enables immediate detection of increased13CO2in the exhaled breath of H. pylori-positive patients.

### AGA clinical practice update on the management of refractory Helicobacter pylori infection: expert review [^e493e190]. Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Refractory Helicobacter pylori — acid suppression strategies and proton pump inhibitor (PPI) selection: Inadequate acid suppression may undermine eradication efforts and optimal dosing of PPIs is frequently overlooked; higher dosing, greater frequency (eg, 3- or 4-times daily PPI dosing), and the use of more potent PPIs (eg, esomeprazole or rabeprazole) may be beneficial in refractory infection. Vonoprazan is a potent intragastric acid suppressor that also bypasses CYP2C19-dependent metabolism, and although not yet available in the United States, trials comparing CYP2C19-metabolized PPIs vs vonoprazan are ongoing in the United States (NCT04167670 at clinicaltrials.gov).

### ACG clinical guideline: treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection [^3c57ae43]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Helicobacter pylori — clarithromycin triple therapy as salvage is limited to susceptibility-confirmed cases and requires optimized acid suppression. Key concept states that in treatment-experienced patients with persistent H. pylori infection that is confirmed to be clarithromycin-sensitive, PPI- or PCAB-clarithromycin triple therapy is suggested. Because eradication is critically dependent on adequate gastric acid suppression (intragastric pH > 6), every effort should be made to optimize aspects of treatment known to influence success, particularly when clarithromycin triple therapy is used as salvage; this includes attention to adherence and optimization of gastric acid suppression. The only clinical scenario in which clarithromycin triple therapy could be repeated after failure of PPI-clarithromycin triple therapy is if H. pylori sensitivity to clarithromycin and amoxicillin has been demonstrated on antibiotic susceptibility testing and there is opportunity to optimize acid suppression, and for such patients the guideline panel suggests using esomeprazole or rabeprazole or a PCAB in the salvage regimen if not already used in the previous regimen.

### Hepatic encephalopathy and Helicobacter pylori: a critical reappraisal [^55167b0c]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2003). Low credibility.

Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a frequent complication of liver cirrhosis, and plasma ammonia plays a pivotal role in its pathogenesis. Ammonia disposal in cirrhotics depend on intricately balanced enzyme and transport systems, involving liver, large and small bowel, muscle, and kidney. Recently, it has been suggested that Helicobacter pylori could contribute to hyperammonemia in cirrhotics, but conflicting data are available in the literature. This is a systematic review of experimental (animals and humans), epidemiological, case-control, and prospective studies, to evaluate the arguments in favor and against the role of H. pylori in HE pathogenesis. Although H. pylori produces ammonia in the stomach, several studies have shown that both basal ammonia levels and HE prevalence did not significantly differ between cirrhotics with and without infection. Moreover, some prospective studies have documented that both blood ammonia levels and mental status in HE cirrhotics are not significantly affected by H. pylori eradication. Even if a small sub-group of cirrhotics with both a high bacterial density and more severe hepatic impairment seems to benefit by bacterial eradication, data indicate that ammonia production in the stomach by H. pylori urease appears to be inadequate to clinically affect ammonia disposal in the majority of cirrhotic patients. Further studies are warranted in this field.

### ACG clinical guideline: treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection [^6259e988]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

High-dose dual therapy (HDDT) for Helicobacter pylori — evidence gap and limited data: In treatment-experienced patients with persistent H. pylori infection, there is insufficient evidence from North America to recommend high-dose PPI or PCAB dual therapy (no recommendation; evidence gap). HDDT consists of potent gastric acid suppression therapy (e.g., high-dose proton pump inhibitor [PPI] or potassium-competitive acid blocker [PCAB]) and high-dose amoxicillin, preferably for 14 days, but the data regarding its efficacy as a salvage regimen are very limited, with no randomized controlled trials (RCTs) from North America. The only study from a Western population is a small noninferiority RCT from Germany published in 2003, in which 84 patients with at least 1 previous H. pylori treatment failure and a confirmed infection were randomized.

### Polarised epithelial monolayers of the gastric mucosa reveal insights into mucosal homeostasis and defence against infection [^49145f29]. Gut (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

Helicobacter pylori causes life-long colonisation of the gastric mucosa, leading to chronic inflammation with increased risk of gastric cancer. Research on the pathogenesis of this infection would strongly benefit from an authentic human in vitro model.

Design

Antrum-derived gastric glands from surgery specimens served to establish polarised epithelial monolayers via a transient air–liquid interface culture stage to study cross-talk with H. pylori and the adjacent stroma.

Results

The resulting 'mucosoid cultures', so named because they recapitulate key characteristics of the gastric mucosa, represent normal stem cell-driven cultures that can be passaged for months. These highly polarised columnar epithelial layers encompass the various gastric antral cell types and secrete mucus at the apical surface. By default, they differentiate towards a foveolar, MUC5AC-producing phenotype, whereas Wnt signalling stimulates proliferation of MUC6-producing cells and preserves stemness — reminiscent of the gland base. Stromal cells from the lamina propria secrete Wnt inhibitors, antagonising stem-cell niche signalling and inducing differentiation. On infection with H. pylori, a strong inflammatory response is induced preferentially in the undifferentiated basal cell phenotype. Infection of cultures for several weeks produces foci of viable bacteria and a persistent inflammatory condition, while the secreted mucus establishes a barrier that only few bacteria manage to overcome.

Conclusion

Gastric mucosoid cultures faithfully reproduce the features of normal human gastric epithelium, enabling new approaches for investigating the interaction of H. pylori with the epithelial surface and the cross-talk with the basolateral stromal compartment. Our observations provide striking insights in the regulatory circuits of inflammation and defence.

ESPGHAN/NASPGHAN pediatric Helicobacter pylori — pre-test medication management and false-negative risk: We recommend that before testing for H pylori, wait at least 2 weeks after stopping PPIs and 4 weeks after stopping antibiotics (GRADE: Strong recommendation. Quality of evidence: low. Agreement: 100%). Parents and guardians should be asked about drug intake during the 4 weeks before testing, and if acid suppressive therapy cannot be discontinued for 2 weeks because of recurrence of symptoms, changing to an H2-receptor antagonist with discontinuation of the drug 2 days before testing may improve the sensitivity of the diagnostic test; antibiotics may suppress bacterial growth and may result in false-negative test results in all applied diagnostic methods except serology (which is not recommended), and PPI therapy may give false-negative diagnostic test results for H pylori infection due to suppression of H pylori replication.

H. pylori eradication therapy

Given that 5% of dyspepsia in the community is attributable to H. pylori, and up to 80% of individuals with dyspepsia have FD, eradicating the bacterium in patients diagnosed with FD who are found to be H. pylori -positive is logical. Updating the prior meta-analysis of H. pylori eradication therapy for infected patients with FD, with 10 new trials recruiting 2896 patients, demonstrated a significant benefit over a control of antisecretory therapy or prokinetics, with or without placebo antibiotics, or a placebo alone in terms of symptom cure or improvement. The RR of symptoms not being cured or improving in 29 trials, containing 6781 patients, was 0.87 (95% CI 0.83 to 0.92) (online supplemental figure 1), with significant heterogeneity between studies (I 2 = 64%). The effect was even larger in individuals whose infection was eradicated successfully, compared with those receiving control therapy, in 16 trials containing 2809 patients (0.74; 95% CI 0.64 to 0.85) (online supplemental figure 2). When only those trials that reported symptom cure were included in the analysis, most of which assessed this at 12 months, there was still a significant benefit of H. pylori eradication therapy (RR of symptoms not being cured = 0.91; 95% CI 0.88 to 0.94) (online supplemental figure 3), with low heterogeneity between studies (I 2 = 7%). Total numbers of adverse events were only reported by eight RCTs, containing 1937 patients, but were significantly more common with eradication therapy. Individual adverse events were not reported in sufficient detail by the trials to allow further assessment. Withdrawals due to adverse events were reported by 18 trials and were again significantly more likely than with control therapy.

Although the treatment effect is modest, cure of symptoms at 12 months is a stringent endpoint, and it is likely that eradication therapy for H. pylori -positive patients with FD is cost-effective, as it only needs to be taken for 1–2 weeks. In terms of which patients are more likely to respond, one trial demonstrated a significant effect of eradication therapy on epigastric pain and burning, but not early satiation or postprandial fullness, suggesting the benefit may be more pronounced in EPS.

Recommendations

Eradication therapy is an efficacious treatment for H. pylori -positive patients with FD. Adverse events are more common than with a control therapy (recommendation: strong; quality of evidence: high).

### AGA clinical practice update on the management of refractory Helicobacter pylori infection: expert review [^cbe1a736]. Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Refractory Helicobacter pylori — CYP2C19 phenotype and acid suppression strategies: Metabolism-enhancing phenotypes of CYP2C19 are associated with higher rates of eradication failure when PPIs that are heavily metabolized by CYP2C19 are used, and CYP2C19-induced PPI metabolism also influences H pylori persistence independent of intragastric pH. In the United States, Caucasians, non-Hispanic African Americans, and Hispanics have a significantly higher prevalence (57%–71%) of metabolism-enhancing CYP2C19 phenotypes compared with Asian American ethnic groups (45%), and Asian Americans also have the highest prevalence of the poor metabolism genotype. Given this distribution, empiric selection of strategies that achieve greater intragastric acid suppression might be reasonable in refractory H pylori infection, including higher dosing and/or increased frequency of first-generation proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), the use of later generation, more potent PPIs, and selecting potent non-PPI gastric acid suppressors, such as vonoprazan, if available.

### Helicobacter pylori fabX contains a [4Fe-4S] cluster essential for unsaturated fatty acid synthesis [^ef7c072a]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

In this work, we obtain the crystal structures of FabX, a FabX–octanoyl-ACP complex and a FabX–holo-ACP complex, and reveal a dynamic acyl-ACP recognition mechanism of FabX. Moreover, the enzyme is found to contain a second electron transfer component, a [4Fe–4S] cluster, in addition to the FMN cofactor, which to date has not been observed in enzymes involved in the fatty acid synthesis. We demonstrate that the [4Fe–4S] cluster functions as a temporary electron depot that receives electrons from FMN and sends electrons back to FMN to achieve independent bidirectional internal electron transfer. Lastly, we demonstrate that the superoxide generated by FabX catalysis as a major source of peroxide excreted by H. pylori which may contribute to its pathogenesis by corrosion of gastric mucosa. These findings may facilitate structure-guided development of antibacterials targeting H. pylori.

### Helicobacter pylori eradication for the prevention of gastric neoplasia [^3201f190]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Gastric cancer is the third most common cause of cancer death worldwide. Individuals infected with Helicobacter pylori have a higher likelihood of developing gastric cancer than individuals who are not infected. Eradication of H. pylori in healthy asymptomatic individuals in the general population may reduce the incidence of gastric cancer, but the magnitude of this effect is unclear.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of eradication of H. pylori in healthy asymptomatic individuals in the general population in reducing the incidence of gastric cancer.

Search Methods

We identified trials by searching the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2013, Issue 11), MEDLINE (1946 to December 2013), and EMBASE (1974 to December 2013). We handsearched reference lists from trials selected by electronic searching to identify further relevant trials. We handsearched published abstracts from conference proceedings from the United European Gastroenterology Week (published in Gut) and Digestive Disease Week (published in Gastroenterology) between 2001 and 2013. We contacted members of the Cochrane Upper Gastrointestinal and Pancreatic Diseases Review Group and experts in the field and asked them to provide details of outstanding clinical trials and any relevant unpublished materials.

Selection Criteria

We analysed randomised controlled trials comparing at least one week of H. pylori therapy with placebo or no treatment in preventing subsequent development of gastric cancer in otherwise healthy and asymptomatic H. pylori-positive adults. Trials had to follow up participants for at least two years and needed to have at least two participants with gastric cancer as an outcome. We defined gastric cancer as any gastric adenocarcinoma, including intestinal (differentiated) or diffuse (undifferentiated) type, with or without specified histology.

Data Collection and Analysis

We collected data on incidence of gastric cancer, incidence of oesophageal cancer, deaths from gastric cancer, deaths from any cause, and adverse effects arising due to therapy.

Main Results

Six trials met all our eligibility criteria and provided extractable data. Three trials were at low risk of bias, one trial was at unclear risk, and two trials were at high risk of bias. Five trials were conducted in Asian populations. In preventing development of subsequent gastric cancer, H. pylori eradication therapy was superior to placebo or no treatment (6 trials, 6497 participants, risk ratio (RR) of developing subsequent gastric cancer 0.66; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.46 to 0.95; moderate-quality evidence). Only one trial reported effect of eradication of H. pylori on development of subsequent oesophageal cancer (2 (0.2%) among 817 participants assigned to eradication therapy, compared with 1 (0.1%) of 813 participants allocated to placebo; RR 1.99; 95% CI 0.18 to 21.91). The effect of H. pylori eradication on preventing death from gastric cancer compared with placebo or no treatment was uncertain due to wide confidence intervals (3 trials, 4475 participants, RR 0.67; 95% CI 0.40 to 1.11; moderate-quality evidence). There was no evidence of an effect on all-cause mortality (4 trials, 5253 participants, RR 1.09; 95% CI 0.86 to 1.38; moderate-quality evidence). Adverse events data were poorly reported.

Authors' Conclusions

We found limited, moderate-quality evidence that searching for and eradicating H. pylori reduces the incidence of gastric cancer in healthy asymptomatic infected Asian individuals, but we cannot necessarily extrapolate this data to other populations.

Stomach — Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) gastritis testing depends on clinical situation, cost considerations, and local expertise; endoscopic options include tissue urease activity, histologic examination, and microbial culture. Sensitivity may be decreased by proton pump inhibitors, bismuth compounds, antibiotics, and acute gastrointestinal bleeding; when sensitivity is reduced, a negative urease test result should be confirmed with a different test for H pylori infection, with histology being a convenient alternative. Culture allows identification of bacterial strain and antimicrobial resistance patterns but is difficult to obtain and performed at only a few centers, and there are limited data on the optimal biopsy protocol.

### Determination of the infectious dose of Helicobacter pylori during primary and secondary infection in rhesus monkeys (macaca mulatta) [^ca39271b]. Infection and Immunity (2001). Low credibility.

We sought to determine the infectious dose of Helicobacter pylori during primary and secondary infection in the rhesus monkey and to determine whether preinoculation acid suppression is necessary to produce colonization. Mixed inoculation with three human-derived strains showed that H. pylori J166 is particularly adapted to colonization of rhesus monkeys, since it outcompeted two other strains. The minimum infectious dose of H. pylori J166 was 10(4) bacteria in specific-pathogen (H. pylori)-free monkeys. Rechallenge of these monkeys after antibiotic therapy was characterized by a 10- to 100-fold decrease in bacterial load compared to primary infection, but with little change in the infectious dose. Acid suppression prior to inoculation was not necessary for colonization to occur. These results provide a basis for future animal experiments using more ecologically relevant conditions of inoculation and suggest that reduction in bacterial load rather than complete protection may be a more realistic goal for H. pylori vaccination.

### Efficacy of dexlansoprazole-based triple therapy forinfections [^774ca251]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Helicobacter pylori infection is a key etiological factor in peptic ulcer disease, gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma, and gastric adenocarcinoma. – The World Health Organization has defined H. pylori as a risk factor for the development of gastric cancer. The standard first-line treatment for H. pylori eradication is triple therapy, which consists of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and two kinds of antibiotics. However, recent epidemiology studies have indicated that the eradication rate for H. pylori is decreasing. The possible causes for eradication therapy failure include antibiotic resistance, smoking, high intragastric bacterial load before treatment, bacterial genotype, poor patient compliance, and host genetic polymorphisms of the cytochrome P450 isoenzymes that are specifically involved in the metabolism of PPIs.

PPIs play an important role in H. pylori eradication. They not only inhibit gastric acid secretion to increase the bioavailability of antibiotics but also have antibacterial activity. The acidic environment maintains H. pylori in a nonreplicating state. Thus, increasing the effectiveness of acid-suppressing therapy can achieve a higher eradication rate. –

Dexlansoprazole and esomeprazole belong to a class of drugs known as PPIs, which inhibit the secretion of hydrogen ions in the stomach by inhibiting the H+/ K+ ATPase enzyme (proton pump), resulting in a prolonged elevation of intragastric pH levels. Dexlansoprazole is a formulation of dual delayed-release delivery system and produces a plasma concentration time profile with two peaks. The first peak occurs 1–2 h after administration and the second peak occurs 4–5 h later. Esomeprazole is a delayed-release formulation with single release characteristics that produces a maximum plasma concentration at approximately 1.6 h post dose.

Dexlansoprazole has been shown to be efficacious in treating gastroesophageal reflux disease. However, there is a paucity of data about its efficacy for H. pylori eradication. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of dexlansoprazole-based triple therapy for H. pylori eradication.

### Omeprazole and sodium bicarbonate [^33c76b8b]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

As do other agents that elevate intragastric pH, omeprazole administered for 14 days in healthy subjects produced a significant increase in the intragastric concentrations of viable bacteria. The pattern of the bacterial species was unchanged from that commonly found in saliva. All changes resolved within three days of stopping treatment.

The course of Barrett's esophagus in 106 patients was evaluated in a U.S. double-blind controlled study of omeprazole 40 mg twice daily for 12 months followed by 20 mg twice daily for 12 months or ranitidine 300 mg twice daily for 24 months. No clinically significant impact on Barrett's mucosa by antisecretory therapy was observed. Although neosquamous epithelium developed during antisecretory therapy, complete elimination of Barrett's mucosa was not achieved. No significant difference was observed between treatment groups in development of dysplasia in Barrett's mucosa, and no patient developed esophageal carcinoma during treatment. No significant differences between treatment groups were observed in development of ECL cell hyperplasia, corpus atrophic gastritis, corpus intestinal metaplasia, or colon polyps exceeding 3 mm in diameter.

### AGA clinical practice update on the management of refractory Helicobacter pylori infection: expert review [^fb94ee7d]. Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for Helicobacter pylori infection, more specifically with respect to management of treatment failure, evaluation, AGA 2021 guidelines recommend to recognize that the usual cause of refractory H. pylori infection (persistent infection after attempting eradication therapy) is antibiotic resistance. Conduct a thorough review of prior antibiotic exposures.

### Omeprazole, sodium bicarbonate [^d49ca734]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

As do other agents that elevate intragastric pH, omeprazole administered for 14 days in healthy subjects produced a significant increase in the intragastric concentrations of viable bacteria. The pattern of the bacterial species was unchanged from that commonly found in saliva. All changes resolved within three days of stopping treatment.

The course of Barrett's esophagus in 106 patients was evaluated in a U.S. double-blind controlled study of omeprazole 40 mg twice daily for 12 months followed by 20 mg twice daily for 12 months or ranitidine 300 mg twice daily for 24 months. No clinically significant impact on Barrett's mucosa by antisecretory therapy was observed. Although neosquamous epithelium developed during antisecretory therapy, complete elimination of Barrett's mucosa was not achieved. No significant difference was observed between treatment groups in development of dysplasia in Barrett's mucosa and no patient developed esophageal carcinoma during treatment. No significant differences between treatment groups were observed in development of ECL cell hyperplasia, corpus atrophic gastritis, corpus intestinal metaplasia, or colon polyps exceeding 3 mm in diameter.

### ACG clinical guideline: small intestinal bacterial overgrowth [^5c27b9bc]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Small bowel ecological homeostasis mechanisms (Table 3) include gastric acid, pancreatic enzymes, bile acids, small bowel motility, the IC valve, and the immune system, with rationales such as "Most ingested bacteria in food cannot survive the acidic stomach", "Digestive enzymes in the proximal small bowel may also digest bacterial products" with "Efficient digestion of nutrients leaves less substrates for bacteria", "As detergents, bile acids can have an effect on bacterial membranes", "Migrating motor complexes and other events cleanse the small intestine of debris during fasting", "The IC valve protects the small bowel from retrograde movement of colonic flora into the small bowel", and "Mucosal immunity may be important in the maintenance of a stable microbiota of the intestinal lumen".
