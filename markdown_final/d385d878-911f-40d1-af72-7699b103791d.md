## Question

Is amlodipi e 2.5 bud or qd

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether amlodipine 2.5 mg should be given once daily (QD) or twice daily (BID). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics that determine dosing frequency. Then, I should verify what the FDA labeling says for adults, including special populations. Next, I will check major guidelines for hypertension management. After that, I should review clinical studies that tested once-daily versus divided dosing. Finally, I will consider exceptions and summarize a clear recommendation with monitoring advice.

> Let me first confirm the pharmacologic rationale for dosing frequency. Amlodipine is a long-acting dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker with a terminal half-life around 30–50 hours and time to steady state of about 7–8 days. Clinically, once-daily dosing maintains antihypertensive effect over the full 24-hour interval with minimal peak–trough fluctuation, which supports QD rather than BID administration [^113wX8vC] [^1124Lyhj] [^113QrJLA].

> Wait, let me verify the FDA labeling for adults. The current FDA prescribing information recommends 5 mg once daily as the usual initial dose, with a maximum of 10 mg once daily. For small, fragile, or elderly patients, or those with hepatic insufficiency, it advises starting at 2.5 mg once daily, explicitly specifying once-daily administration and not divided dosing [^117W3ZdE] [^112zZYDc].

> I should confirm whether any authoritative guidelines contradict this. The 2025 ACC/AHA hypertension guideline tables list amlodipine 2.5–10 mg with a daily frequency of 1, reinforcing once-daily dosing across the dose range, and the VA/DoD hypertension guideline likewise summarizes amlodipine 2.5–10 mg daily, again implying QD frequency [^114txBia] [^114jkPmc].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I need to check if any clinical studies tested divided dosing. A crossover study that directly compared once-daily amlodipine 10 mg with the same total dose divided twice daily found no significant differences in 24-hour blood pressure control, trough concentrations, or arterial stiffness, supporting that splitting the dose does not improve outcomes. Similarly, a study simulating missed doses showed amlodipine's effect persists longer than 24 hours, consistent with its long half-life and QD suitability [^114DShAh] [^114mcgbU].

> But wait, what if there are special scenarios where BID is used? I should double-check. High-dose amlodipine regimens up to 20–30 mg have been described in selected pulmonary arterial hypertension responders, yet even in that niche context, guidance recommends starting low and titrating cautiously while still administering once daily; this does not translate to routine BID use for hypertension or angina [^115DLpe8] [^112CdtuD].

> Let me consider practical implications and adherence. Contemporary guideline methodology emphasizes once-daily regimens over multiple daily doses to improve adherence, and amlodipine's pharmacokinetics make it well suited to this strategy. Moreover, its antihypertensive effect is largely attained within about 2 weeks, which aligns with standard 1–2 week titration intervals in labeling and practice [^116hV8LX] [^117W3ZdE].

> I should confirm pediatric considerations briefly. In children 6–17 years, the effective dose studied is 2.5–5 mg once daily, again reinforcing QD as the standard frequency rather than divided dosing [^117W3ZdE].

> Putting this together, I need to ensure the recommendation is precise. Amlodipine 2.5 mg should be administered once daily (QD), not twice daily (BID), because its long half-life provides sustained 24-hour blood pressure control, FDA labeling specifies once-daily dosing across indications, major guidelines codify a frequency of 1 per day, and clinical studies show no advantage to divided dosing; BID is not indicated or supported for routine care [^117W3ZdE] [^114txBia] [^114DShAh].

> Finally, I should review monitoring and titration. Wait 7–14 days between dose changes to allow steady-state effect, monitor blood pressure and watch for dose-related peripheral edema, and consider the 2.5 mg starting dose in elderly or hepatically impaired patients where exposure is higher and lower initial dosing improves tolerability. If blood pressure remains uncontrolled after appropriate titration, consider combination therapy rather than splitting the amlodipine dose [^117W3ZdE] [^114jkPmc].

Amlodipine 2.5 mg is **once daily (QD)** for hypertension, angina, or coronary artery disease. This dosing aligns with its long half-life (30–50 hours) [^113wX8vC] and sustained 24-hour effect [^113QrJLA], supporting once-daily use [^1129y34M]. In elderly, small, or hepatically impaired patients, start at 2.5 mg QD and titrate to 5–10 mg QD as needed [^117W3ZdE] [^113C3kkn]. Divided dosing is not recommended because it does not improve control or adherence [^114DShAh] [^116hV8LX].

---

## Pharmacokinetic rationale for once-daily dosing

- **Half-life**: 30–50 hours, enabling once-daily dosing and stable 24-hour control [^113wX8vC] [^116suFj8].
- **Steady state**: Reached after 7–8 days of daily dosing [^113wX8vC] [^1124Lyhj].
- **Food**: No significant effect on absorption or bioavailability [^113wX8vC] [^1124Lyhj].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting once-daily dosing

Clinical trials show that **once-daily amlodipine** [^113QrJLA] reduces blood pressure by about 12/6 mmHg (standing) and 13/7 mmHg (supine) at 24 hours, with minimal peak–trough variation and no tolerance over 1 year [^111AzfxH]. Once-daily dosing maintains **antihypertensive effect over 24 hours** [^113QrJLA], correlating with plasma concentrations and clinical effect [^116suFj8].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines recommend **once-daily dosing** for amlodipine, including at 2.5 mg, 5 mg, and 10 mg [^114txBia] [^111c5jRo]. For elderly, small, or hepatically impaired patients, start at 2.5 mg QD and titrate to 5–10 mg QD as needed [^117W3ZdE] [^113kYQtq].

---

## Comparison with twice-daily dosing

Dividing the dose does not improve **blood pressure control**, trough concentrations, or adherence [^114DShAh]. Once-daily dosing is preferred for **adherence and convenience** [^116hV8LX].

---

## Clinical scenarios where twice-daily dosing may be considered

Twice-daily dosing is **not standard** but may be considered in rare cases of severe intolerance to higher once-daily doses, with close monitoring for edema or hypotension.

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Patient population** | **Recommended dose** | **Frequency** |
|-|-|-|
| General adult population | 5–10 mg | Once daily |
| Elderly, small, or hepatic impairment | 2.5 mg initially | Once daily |
| Pediatric patients (6–17 years) | 2.5–5 mg | Once daily |

---

Amlodipine 2.5 mg is **once daily (QD)** for hypertension, angina, or coronary artery disease, with dosing individualized to patient factors and titrated as needed [^117W3ZdE].

2 DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION

Adult recommended starting dose: 5 mg once daily with maximum dose 10 mg once daily. (2.1)
Small, fragile, or elderly patients, or patients with hepatic insufficiency may be started on 2.5 mg once daily. (2.1)
Pediatric starting dose: 2.5 mg to 5 mg once daily. (2.2)

Important Limitation: Doses in excess of 5 mg daily have not been studied in pediatric patients. (2.2)

2.1 Adults

The usual initial antihypertensive oral dose of Amlodipine besylate tablets is 5 mg once daily, and the maximum dose is 10 mg once daily.

Small, fragile, or elderly patients, or patients with hepatic insufficiency may be started on 2.5 mg once daily and this dose may be used when adding Amlodipine besylate tablets to other antihypertensive therapy.

Adjust dosage according to blood pressure goals. In general, wait 7 to 14 days between titration steps. Titrate more rapidly, however, if clinically warranted, provided the patient is assessed frequently.

Angina: The recommended dose for chronic stable or vasospastic angina is 5 to 10 mg, with the lower dose suggested in the elderly and in patients with hepatic insufficiency. Most patients will require 10 mg for adequate effect.

Coronary artery disease: The recommended dose range for patients with coronary artery disease is 5 to 10 mg once daily. In clinical studies, the majority of patients required 10 mg [see Clinical Studies (14.4)].

2.2 Children

The effective antihypertensive oral dose in pediatric patients ages 6 to 17 years is 2.5 mg to 5 mg once daily. Doses in excess of 5 mg daily have not been studied in pediatric patients [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.4), Clinical Studies (14.1)].

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Hemodynamics: Following administration of therapeutic doses to patients with hypertension, amlodipine produces vasodilation resulting in a reduction of supine and standing blood pressures. These decreases in blood pressure are not accompanied by a significant change in heart rate or plasma catecholamine levels with chronic dosing. Although the acute intravenous administration of amlodipine decreases arterial blood pressure and increases heart rate in hemodynamic studies of patients with chronic stable angina, chronic oral administration of amlodipine in clinical trials did not lead to clinically significant changes in heart rate or blood pressures in normotensive patients with angina.

With chronic once daily oral administration, antihypertensive effectiveness is maintained for at least 24 hours. Plasma concentrations correlate with effect in both young and elderly patients. The magnitude of reduction in blood pressure with amlodipine is also correlated with the height of pretreatment elevation; thus, individuals with moderate hypertension (diastolic pressure 105 114 mmHg) had about a 50% greater response than patients with mild hypertension (diastolic pressure 90–104 mmHg). Normotensive subjects experienced no clinically significant change in blood pressures (+1/–2 mmHg).

In hypertensive patients with normal renal function, therapeutic doses of amlodipine resulted in a decrease in renal vascular resistance and an increase in glomerular filtration rate and effective renal plasma flow without change in filtration fraction or proteinuria.

As with other calcium channel blockers, hemodynamic measurements of cardiac function at rest and during exercise (or pacing) in patients with normal ventricular function treated with amlodipine have generally demonstrated a small increase in cardiac index without significant influence on dP/dt or on left ventricular end diastolic pressure or volume. In hemodynamic studies, amlodipine has not been associated with a negative inotropic effect when administered in the therapeutic dose range to intact animals and man, even when co-administered with beta-blockers to man. Similar findings, however, have been observed in normal or well-compensated patients with heart failure with agents possessing significant negative inotropic effects.

Electrophysiologic Effects: Amlodipine does not change sinoatrial nodal function or atrioventricular conduction in intact animals or man. In patients with chronic stable angina, intravenous administration of 10 mg did not significantly alter A-H and H-V conduction and sinus node recovery time after pacing. Similar results were obtained in patients receiving amlodipine and concomitant beta-blockers. In clinical studies in which amlodipine was administered in combination with beta-blockers to patients with either hypertension or angina, no adverse effects on electrocardiographic parameters were observed. In clinical trials with angina patients alone, amlodipine therapy did not alter electrocardiographic intervals or produce higher degrees of AV blocks.

### Effect of amlodipine on systolic blood pressure [^114GrYnZ]. Clinical Therapeutics (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Systolic hypertension is the most common form of hypertension, particularly in people aged > 60 years. Caused by decreased compliance of large arteries, systolic hypertension is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Recent studies have demonstrated that it is more important to control systolic blood pressure (SBP) than diastolic blood pressure (DBP).

Objective

The objective of this study was to perform a systematic literature review to examine the effectiveness of amlodipine in lowering SBP in a variety of patient subgroups and clinical settings.

Methods

The literature review methodology included identifying, selecting, appraising, extracting, and synthesizing primary research studies. Following an a priori protocol, published literature was searched from 1980 to 2001 using 3 electronic databases. A manual review of the reference lists of recent review articles and all accepted studies was performed. Parallel-group, randomized, controlled trials that included at least 10 adults with baseline hypertension (SBP ≥ 140 mm Hg, DBP ≥ 90 mm Hg, or both), included at least 1 arm randomized to initial treatment with amlodipine monotherapy, had a minimum treatment duration of 8 weeks, and reported baseline and end-point blood pressure were included.

Results

Of 696 citations identified, 85 primary studies met all inclusion criteria. Comparable treatment arms were pooled, and weightd mean SBP was calculated. In the amlodipine monotherapy arms, which included > 5000 patients, SBP decreased by a mean of 17.5 mm Hg from baseline. The effect of amlodipine in reducing SBP was greater in elderly patients (age ≥ 60 years) and patients with author-defined isolated systolic hypertension. The dose was titrated to achieve the target blood pressure in 73 of 89 amlodipine treatment arms, whereas 16 treatment arms reported fixed doses. The median daily dose was 5 mg (range, 1.25–15 mg) in both the fixed-dose and dose-titration groups.

Conclusions

In this review of the published literature, amlodipine monotherapy was effective in reducing SBP. Antihypertensive agents such as amlodipine warrant consideration for the management of patients with inadequately controlled SBP.

### 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure control with triple-therapy amlodipine, valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide in patients with moderate to severe hypertension [^112jqRHh]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2011). Low credibility.

Conclusion

In patients with moderate to severe hypertension, once-daily therapy with Aml/Val/HCTZ (10/320/25 mg) reduces ABP throughout the 24-h dosing interval, including the overall 24-h, daytime and night time periods, to a significantly greater extent than component-based dual therapy. Aml/Val/HCTZ lowers MASBP/MADBP by ∼30/20 mm Hg throughout the day in these patients with even greater reduction observed in those patients with more severe systolic hypertension. Notably, triple therapy with Aml/Val/HCTZ effectively controls MASBP to ≤ 130 mm Hg for every hour throughout the day, including early morning hours.

14.1 Effects in Hypertension

Adult Patients

The antihypertensive efficacy of amlodipine has been demonstrated in a total of 15 double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized studies involving 800 patients on amlodipine and 538 on placebo. Once daily administration produced statistically significant placebo-corrected reductions in supine and standing blood pressures at 24 hours postdose, averaging about 12/6 mmHg in the standing position and 13/7 mmHg in the supine position in patients with mild to moderate hypertension. Maintenance of the blood pressure effect over the 24-hour dosing interval was observed, with little difference in peak and trough effect. Tolerance was not demonstrated in patients studied for up to 1 year. The 3 parallel, fixed dose, dose response studies showed that the reduction in supine and standing blood pressures was dose-related within the recommended dosing range. Effects on diastolic pressure were similar in young and older patients. The effect on systolic pressure was greater in older patients, perhaps because of greater baseline systolic pressure. Effects were similar in black patients and in white patients.

Pediatric Patients

Two hundred sixty-eight hypertensive patients aged 6 to 17 years were randomized first to amlodipine 2.5 or 5 mg once daily for 4 weeks and then randomized again to the same dose or to placebo for another 4 weeks. Patients receiving 2.5 mg or 5 mg at the end of 8 weeks had significantly lower systolic blood pressure than those secondarily randomized to placebo. The magnitude of the treatment effect is difficult to interpret, but it is probably less than 5 mmHg systolic on the 5 mg dose and 3.3 mmHg systolic on the 2.5 mg dose. Adverse events were similar to those seen in adults.

### Two multicenter, 8-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group studies evaluating the efficacy and tolerability of amlodipine and valsartan in combination and as monotherapy in adult patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension [^114mdjBt]. Clinical Therapeutics (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with hypertension may require combination therapy to attain the blood pressure targets recommended by US and European treatment guidelines. Combination therapy with a calcium channel blocker and an angiotensin II-receptor blocker would be expected to provide enhanced efficacy.

Objectives

Two studies were conducted to compare the efficacy of various combinations of amlodipine and valsartan administered once daily with their individual components and placebo in patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension (mean sitting diastolic blood pressure [MSDBP] ≥ 95 and < 110 mm Hg). A secondary objective was to evaluate safety and tolerability.

Methods

The 2 studies were multinational, multicenter, 8-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trials. In study 1, patients were randomized to receive amlodipine 2.5 or 5 mg once daily, valsartan 40 to 320 mg once daily, the combination of amlodipine 2.5 or 5 mg with valsartan 40 to 320 mg once daily, or placebo. In study 2, patients were randomized to receive amlodipine 10 mg once daily, valsartan 160 or 320 mg once daily, the combination of amlodipine 10 mg with valsartan 160 or 320 mg once daily, or placebo. The primary efficacy variable in both studies was change from baseline in MSDBP at the end of the study. Secondary variables included the change in mean sitting systolic blood pressure (MSSBP), response rate (the proportion of patients achieving an MSDBP < 90 mm Hg or a ≥ 10-mm Hg decrease from baseline), and control rate (the proportion of patients achieving an MSDBP < 90 mm Hg). Safety was assessed in terms of adverse events (spontaneously reported or elicited by questioning), vital signs, and laboratory values.

Results

A total of 1911 patients were randomized to treatment in study 1 (1022 amlodipine + valsartan; 507 valsartan; 254 amlodipine; 128 placebo); 1250 were randomized to treatment in study 2 (419, 415, 207, and 209, respectively). In all treatment groups in both studies, the majority of patients were white (79.5% study 1, 79.4% study 2) and male (53.5% and 50.3%, respectively). The overall mean age was 54.4 years in study 1 and 56.9 years in study 2. The mean weight of patients in study 1 was higher than that in study 2 (88.8 vs 79.7 kg). The overall baseline mean sitting BP was 152.8/99.3 mm Hg in study 1 and 156.7/99.1 mm Hg in study 2. With the exception of a few combinations that included amlodipine 2.5 mg, the combination regimens in both studies were associated with significantly greater reductions in MSDBP and MSSBP compared with their individual components and placebo (P < 0.05). A positive dose response was observed for all combinations. The highest response rate in study 1 was associated with the highest dose of combination therapy (amlodipine 5 mg + valsartan 320 mg: 91.3%). Amlodipine 5 mg, valsartan 320 mg, and placebo were associated with response rates of 71.9%, 73.4%, and 40.9%, respectively. In study 2, the 2 doses of combination therapy were associated with similar response rates (amlodipine 10 mg + valsartan 160 mg: 88.5%; amlodipine 10 mg + valsartan 320 mg: 87.5%). Amlodipine 10 mg was associated with a response rate of 86.9%; valsartan 160 and 20 mg were associated with response rates of 74.9% and 72.0%, respectively; and placebo was associated with a response rate of 49.3%. Control rates followed a similar pattern. The incidence of peripheral edema with combination therapy was significantly lower compared with amlodipine monotherapy (5.4% vs 8.7%, respectively; P = 0.014), was significantly higher compared with valsartan monotherapy (2.1%; P < 0.001), and did not differ significantly from placebo (3.0%).

Conclusions

In these adult patients with mild to moderate hypertension, the combination of amlodipine + valsartan was associated with significantly greater blood pressure reductions from baseline compared with amlodipine or valsartan monotherapy or placebo. The incidence of peripheral edema was significantly lower with combination therapy than with amlodipine monotherapy.

### Amlodipine in hypertension: a first-line agent with efficacy for improving blood pressure and patient outcomes [^115hbdw4]. Open Heart (2016). Low credibility.

Clinical indications, pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics

Amlodipine is a long-acting, lipophilic, third generation dihydropyridine (DHP) CCBs that exerts its action through inhibition of calcium influx into vascular smooth muscle cells and myocardial cells, which results in decreased peripheral vascular resistance (PVR). Amlodipine is indicated for the treatment of high blood pressure (BP)/HTN and angina. In addition, a number of randomised trials have ascertained its utility in angina pectoris. Amlodipine is usually dosed on a once daily basis because of its long half-life, which is favourable for patient compliance. A starting dose of 5 mg is usually recommended with a maximum daily dose of 10 mg. In the elderly population and those with hepatic failure, a starting dose of 2.5 mg is recommended. Amlodipine has a gradual onset of action and hence no significant reflex neuroendocrine activation. Activating reflex mechanisms, such as increased PVR and elevated heart rate, can cause negative effects on lipid and carbohydrate metabolism. These notable adverse effects are commonly seen with other agents including the first generation β-blockers (BBs; such as atenolol and metoprolol) and earlier generation of DHPs. Amlodipine has a high bioavailability, ranging from 60% to 80%; it undergoes hepatic metabolism and shows some impaired elimination in the setting of liver cirrhosis but no accumulation with renal failure. Amlodipine also has a slow rate of elimination over 40–60 hours. If amlodipine is discontinued, BP generally returns to baseline over 1 week without any dangerous rebound elevations in BP (unlike clonidine).

### Starting antihypertensive drug treatment with combination therapy: controversies in hypertension-con side of the argument [^112bdiHL]. Hypertension (2021). Medium credibility.

The Simplified Treatment Intervention to Control Hypertension Study was a cluster-randomized trial, involving 45 family practices in Ontario, Canada and compared control rates of hypertension as achieved by a simplified treatment algorithm (experimental group) or following the Canadian Hypertension Program guideline (control group). The systolic/diastolic target BP was < 140/ < 90 mm Hg and < 130/ < 90 mm Hg in diabetic patients. The simplified treatment algorithm consisted of the following: (1) initial therapy with a low-dose ACE inhibitor/TD or ARB/TD SPC; (2) uptitration of the combination therapy to the highest dose; (3) addition and subsequent uptitration of a CCB; and (4) addition of a βB, α-blocker, or spironolactone. The proportion of patients achieving target BP at 6 months was higher in the experimental (N = 802) than the control (N = 1246) group (64.7% versus 52.7%; P = 0.026). At 6 months, 82.8% of patients in the experimental group were on SPCs and 16.4% in the control group. However, no information on BP control beyond 6 months was provided.

A third randomized double-blind study evaluated the efficacy and safety of triple therapy with amlodipine/valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide for moderate or severe hypertension (systolic/diastolic BP, 145/100 mm Hg or higher). After a 1-week single-blind placebo run-in, patients were randomly assigned to valsartan/amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide 320/10/25 mg, valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide 320/25 mg, valsartan/amlodipine 320/10 mg, or amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide 10/25 mg with uptitration of these once daily SPCs from week 1 to week 3. Of the 4285 patients screened, 2271 (53.0%) were randomized (women, 44.7%; mean age, 53.2 years; mean entry BP, 169.9/106.5 mm Hg) and 2060 (90.7%) completed the 8-week trial. Triple therapy was significantly superior to all of the dual therapies in reducing BP (P < 0.0001). Results were similar across sex, age, and ethnicity strata. The limitations of this study were like those of the COACH trial.

### Clinical benefit of fixed-dose combination of amlodipine and potent atorvastatin in patients with concomitant hypertension and hypercholesterolemia [^112yMKfB]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Hypertension and hypercholesterolemia frequently coexist in the general population up to 30.7%, and the combination of these 2 risk factors has adverse effects and markedly increases the risk of CVD. Concomitant treatment of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia in patients with both disorders is recommended by contemporary guidelines, especially for those with a high risk of CVD. Fixed‐dose combinations (FDCs) are widely used in the treatment of chronic diseases to simplify regimens, improve drug adherence, and reduce medical costs. Previously, randomized trials of patients with concomitant hypertension and hypercholesterolemia have demonstrated the efficacy and safety of single‐pill amlodipine/atorvastatin FDCs. Compared with the free‐equivalent combination (FEC) of 5 mg of amlodipine and 10 mg of atorvastatin per day, the FDC of the same regimen significantly reduced the composite of major adverse cardiac events (MACEs), including all‐cause death, myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, and coronary revascularization, based on propensity score matching of patients with concomitant hypertension and hypercholesterolemia in our previous population‐based study. Meanwhile, current clinical guidelines recommend moderate‐intensity statins, such as 20 mg of atorvastatin daily, as the initial dosage in patients with hypercholesterolemia, and another multi‐institutional cohort study we conducted demonstrated that LDL‐C levels were significantly reduced by an FDC of 5 mg of amlodipine and 20 mg of atorvastatin daily (high dose), compared with either an FDC or FEC of 5 mg of amlodipine and 10 mg of atorvastatin daily (low dose), with a similar BP reduction effect. The inferior efficacy and clinical outcomes of the FEC with 5 mg of amlodipine and 10 mg of atorvastatin have already been described in our previous studies, and this group of patients was not included in the current study.

The present study aimed to evaluate the clinical outcomes of a high‐ and low‐dose amlodipine/atorvastatin FDC and their FEC counterparts in patients with concurrent hypertension and hypercholesterolemia in a population‐based nationwide cohort.

### Telmisartan and amlodipine [^1116Jd1x]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

2.1 General Considerations

Telmisartan is an effective treatment of hypertension in once daily doses of 20 to 80 mg while amlodipine is effective in doses of 2.5 to 10 mg.

Dosage must be individualized and may be increased after at least 2 weeks. Most of the antihypertensive effect is apparent within 2 weeks and maximal reduction is generally attained after 4 weeks. The maximum recommended dose of telmisartan and amlodipine tablets is 80/10 mg once daily.

The adverse reactions of telmisartan are uncommon and independent of dose; those of amlodipine are a mixture of dose-dependent phenomena (primarily peripheral edema) and dose-independent phenomena, the former much more common than the latter [see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.1)].

Telmisartan and amlodipine tablets may be taken with or without food.

2.2 Replacement Therapy

Patients receiving amlodipine and telmisartan from separate tablets may instead receive telmisartan and amlodipine tablets containing the same component doses once daily. When substituting for individual components, increase the dose of telmisartan and amlodipine tablets if blood pressure control has not been satisfactory.

2.3 Add-on Therapy for Patients with Hypertension Not Adequately Controlled on Antihypertensive Monotherapy

Telmisartan and amlodipine tablets may be used to provide additional blood pressure lowering for patients not adequately controlled with amlodipine (or another dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker) alone or with telmisartan (or another angiotensin receptor blocker) alone.

Patients treated with 10 mg amlodipine who experience any dose-limiting adverse reactions such as edema, may be switched to telmisartan and amlodipine tablets 40/5 mg once daily, reducing the dose of amlodipine without reducing the overall expected antihypertensive response [see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.1)].

Amlodipine: Elimination from the plasma is biphasic with a terminal elimination half-life of about 30 to 50 hours. Ten percent of the parent amlodipine compound and 60% of the metabolites of amlodipine are excreted in the urine.

Atorvastatin: Atorvastatin and its metabolites are eliminated primarily in bile following hepatic and/or extra-hepatic metabolism; however, the drug does not appear to undergo enterohepatic recirculation. Mean plasma elimination half-life of atorvastatin in humans is approximately 14 hours, but the half-life of inhibitory activity for HMG-CoA reductase is 20 to 30 hours because of the contribution of active metabolites. Less than 2% of a dose of atorvastatin is recovered in urine following oral administration.

Specific Populations

Geriatric

Amlodipine: Elderly patients have decreased clearance of amlodipine with a resulting increase in AUC of approximately 40 to 60%, and a lower initial dose of amlodipine may be required.

Atorvastatin: Plasma concentrations of atorvastatin are higher (approximately 40% for Cmaxand 30% for AUC) in healthy elderly subjects (age ≥ 65 years) than in young adults.

Pediatric

Amlodipine: Sixty-two hypertensive patients aged 6 to 17 years received doses of amlodipine between 1.25 mg and 20 mg. Weight-adjusted clearance and volume of distribution were similar to values in adults.

Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism

After oral administration of therapeutic doses of amlodipine, absorption produces peak plasma concentrations between 6 and 12 hours. Absolute bioavailability has been estimated to be between 64 and 90%. The bioavailability of amlodipine is not altered by the presence of food.

Amlodipine is extensively (about 90%) converted to inactive metabolites via hepatic metabolism with 10% of the parent compound and 60% of the metabolites excreted in the urine. Ex vivo studies have shown that approximately 93% of the circulating drug is bound to plasma proteins in hypertensive patients. Elimination from the plasma is biphasic with a terminal elimination half-life of about 30–50 hours. Steady-state plasma levels of amlodipine are reached after 7 to 8 days of consecutive daily dosing.

The pharmacokinetics of amlodipine are not significantly influenced by renal impairment. Patients with renal failure may therefore receive the usual initial dose.

Elderly patients and patients with hepatic insufficiency have decreased clearance of amlodipine with a resulting increase in AUC of approximately 40–60%, and a lower initial dose may be required. A similar increase in AUC was observed in patients with moderate to severe heart failure.

Pediatric Patients

Sixty-two hypertensive patients aged 6 to 17 years received doses of amlodipine between 1.25 mg and 20 mg. Weight-adjusted clearance and volume of distribution were similar to values in adults.

Trial Procedures

Trial consultations for participants were conducted remotely. All contact with the research trial team was held remotely via a teleconference using a mobile phone, laptop, personal computer, or telephone (in practice almost all contact was by telephone). Trial participants took part in teleconsultations at agreed‐upon times. Clinical members of the trial team — clinical scientists (n = 3), research nurses (n = 3), doctors (n = 2) — contacted participants at least once every 2 weeks. Calls to participants in the observation arm were undertaken by nurses or clinical scientists. Doctors and nurses conducted the titration calls to participants in the intervention arm.

Intervention cohort participants had a remote consultation via tele‐call at least every 2 weeks while on treatment (from Baseline [Week 0] to Week 14). This involved the review of their BP and adjustment of medication dosage as indicated depending on all other smartphone app‐recorded data including side effects. Trial dose titration teleconsultations (and coinciding adherence checks) were scheduled twice weekly as pharmacokinetic‐pharmacodynamic studies show that it may take approximately 2 weeks before amlodipine exerts its full effect, which agrees with the clinical experience of the principal investigator. Adherence to monitoring routines was checked every 2 weeks by completeness of data entry and self‐reported outcomes by the participant. Adjustment of amlodipine dose for most participants was completed by the last titration visit (Week 12). A follow‐up call was made to ensure that participants in the intervention cohort were stable on posttrial treatment.

The observation cohort was not designed to serve as a direct comparator for the interventional cohort, as the 2 cohorts were inherently not comparable in terms of baseline BP (separation of cohorts was based on their baseline BP). Entrants to the observational cohort had adequately controlled BP and did not require the same frequency of review as those in the interventional cohort who had a dose titration consultation at least biweekly. The purpose of the observational cohort was to provide safety monitoring (3‐month) follow‐up with appropriate consultation frequency (monthly) and also to allow participants whose BP control became inadequate to be considered for entry to the interventional cohort (24 observational cohort participants transitioned to interventional cohort).

### Comparative efficacy and safety profile of amlodipine 5 mg / losartan 50 mg fixed-dose combination and amlodipine 10 mg monotherapy in hypertensive patients who respond poorly to amlodipine 5 mg monotherapy: an 8-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind phase III noninferiority study [^1135h2YB]. Clinical Therapeutics (2011). Low credibility.

Background

The number of hypertensive patients achieving treatment targets is not ideal with therapies that engage a single mechanism of action, and combination therapies using different mechanisms of action can increase drug efficacy in a synergistic way.

Objective

This noninferiority study compared the clinical efficacy and safety profile of fixed-dose combination of amlodipine/losartan 5/50 mg and amlodipine 10 mg monotherapy in essential hypertensive patients who respond poorly to amlodipine 5 mg monotherapy.

Methods

This was a double-blind, multicenter, randomized trial of hypertensive patients (N = 185) aged ≥ 18 years taking amlodipine 5 mg during the run-in treatment period but failed to achieve sitting diastolic blood pressure (DBP) < 90 mm Hg. After randomization into the amlodipine/losartan 5/50 mg fixed-dose combination group (n = 92) and the amlodipine 10 mg monotherapy group (n = 93), treatment was maintained without dose escalation for 8 weeks. The noninferiority margin was prespecified as 4 mm Hg after 8 weeks of treatment for the difference of the average change in DBP between treatments. The primary efficacy evaluation of noninferiority was tested using a confidence interval approach with a 97.5% 1-sided lower confidence limit using the average difference in DBP measured at baseline and 8 weeks.

Results

After 8 weeks, the DBP of both groups decreased from baseline by 8.9 (6.1) and 9.4 (7.5) mm Hg, respectively (difference = -0.5 [6.9] mm Hg, 95% CI: -2.5 to 1.5). Secondary end points of reductions in DBP after 4 weeks (-8.1 [6.7] vs -9.9 [7.3] mm Hg, difference = -1.8 mm Hg, 95% CI: -3.9 to 0.2) and sitting systolic blood pressure after 4 (-10.2 [11.8] vs -12.8 [10.2] mm Hg, difference = -2.6 mm Hg, 95% CI: -5.9 to 0.6) and 8 weeks (-12.2 [11.0] vs -13.4 [11.3] mm Hg, difference = -1.2 mmHg, 95% CI: -4.4 to 2.1) were comparable between the 2 treatment groups. There were 38 adverse events in 20 patients (21.7%) in the amlodipine/losartan 5/50 mg fixed-dose combination group and 31 in 24 patients (26.1%) in the amlodipine 10 mg monotherapy group; most were mild. There were 7 adverse events in 6 patients (6.5%) related to treatment in the fixed-dose combination group and 13 in 10 patients (10.9%) in the monotherapy group (P = 0.30).

Conclusions

Fixed-dose combination amlodipine/losartan 5/50 mg was not inferior in terms of reductions in DBP after 8 weeks of treatment and had comparable safety profile to amlodipine 10 mg in patients who did not respond to amlodipine 5 mg monotherapy. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00940667.

Study design

Patients who are currently not taking any antihypertensive medications (for example, naïve) or those who have completed a washout of their current antihypertensive medications and who have met BP enrollment criteria were randomized to 1 of the 12 treatment regimens: placebo, amlodipine monotherapy (5 or 10 mg day −1), olmesartan medoxomil monotherapy (10, 20 or 40 mg day −1) or combination therapy with amlodipine+olmesartan medoxomil, including all possible dose combinations of the monotherapy groups. Randomization included a stratification based on age (< 65 years and ⩾65 years) and diabetes status. Efficacy data reported here comprise the highest US Food and Drug Administration-approved dosage of amlodipine (10 mg day −1) combined with olmesartan medoxomil (40 mg day −1), the constituent monotherapies and placebo. Efficacy data are not reported for patients receiving olmesartan medoxomil 10 mg day −1, 20 mg day −1, amlodipine 5 mg day −1, amlodipine+olmesartan medoxomil 5+10 mg day −1, 5+20 mg day −1, 5+40 mg day −1, 10+10 mg day −1 and 10+20 mg day −1 but are available in Supplementary Tables 1 and 2.

Patients were instructed to take their medication at the same time each day (± 2 h). Clinic visits were scheduled to allow a trough BP measurement 24 h after the normal dosing time, and patients were refrained from taking their daily medication until all the measurements were completed.

Therapeutic efficacy and safety were evaluated at weeks 2, 4, 6 and 8. Vital signs, including BP and heart rate, were obtained at all scheduled visits. BP was assessed at all participating sites using an automated BP-monitoring device (Omron Model HEM-705CP). After a 5-min rest period, three separate seated BP (SeBP) measurements were taken at 1 min apart, and the mean of the three readings was recorded.

For the efficacy evaluation, the intent-to-treat population was the primary-analysis population and included all the patients who took at least one dose of double-blind study medication and had one post-baseline BP measurement. Patients who took at least one dose of randomized, double-blind study medication were included in the safety population.

### 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure control with triple-therapy amlodipine, valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide in patients with moderate to severe hypertension [^113jv223]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2011). Low credibility.

Discussion

This is the first large-scale, controlled trial to prospectively study the effects of once-daily triple therapy with Aml/Val/HCTZ versus component-based dual therapy for controlling ABP throughout the 24-h interval. The ABPM data from this subgroup of patients corroborate the clinic BP findings from the entire study population. Overall, the ABPM data show that treatment with Aml/Val/HCTZ lowered MASBP/MADBP by ∼30/20 mm Hg throughout the 24-h period, which was significantly better than the reductions achieved in patients receiving dual therapy. An even greater improvement in MASBP (reductions of 37 mm Hg) was observed among triple-therapy patients with severe systolic hypertension at baseline (MSSBP ⩾180 and < 200 mm Hg).

The results from the current study further show that the reductions in ABP are relatively uniform throughout the 24-h dosing period. Notably, at end point, hourly MASBP/MADBP levels among patients receiving Aml/Val/HCTZ remained ≤ 130/85 mm Hg for every hour of the 24-h dosing period, including the early morning hours. MASBP/MADBP between 0600 hours and 1200 hours, the hours coinciding with the morning surge in BP, was 124/80 mm Hg in the triple-therapy group. The ABP levels achieved with triple therapy are clinically relevant considering the 24-h, daytime and night time means were lower than the lower end of the European Society of Hypertension/European Society of Cardiology SBP/DBP target goal ranges for ABP (125–130/80, 130–135/85 and 120/70 mm Hg, respectively).

### Amlodipine besylate and valsartan (Exforge) [^117KQbGW]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

8.5 Geriatric Use

In controlled clinical trials, 323 (22.5%) hypertensive patients treated with Exforge were ≥ 65 years and 79 (5.5%) were ≥ 75 years. No overall differences in the efficacy or safety of Exforge was observed in this patient population, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.

Amlodipine: The recommended starting dose of amlodipine 2.5 mg is not an available strength with Exforge.

Clinical studies of amlodipine besylate tablets did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Elderly patients have decreased clearance of amlodipine with a resulting increase of area under the curve (AUC) of approximately 40% to 60%.

Valsartan: In the controlled clinical trials of valsartan, 1214 (36.2%) of hypertensive patients treated with valsartan were ≥ 65 years and 265 (7.9%) were ≥ 75 years. No overall difference in the efficacy or safety of valsartan was observed in this patient population, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.

8.6 Renal Impairment

Safety and effectiveness of Exforge in patients with severe renal impairment (CrCl < 30 mL/min) have not been established. No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild (CrCl 60 to 90 mL/min) or moderate (CrCl 30 to 60 mL/min) renal impairment.

8.7 Hepatic Impairment

Amlodipine

Exposure to amlodipine is increased in patients with hepatic insufficiency [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The recommended initial dose of amlodipine in patients with hepatic impairment is 2.5 mg, which is not an available strength with Exforge.

Valsartan

No dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mild-to-moderate disease. No dosing recommendations can be provided for patients with severe liver disease.

Hemodynamics

Following administration of therapeutic doses to patients with hypertension, amlodipine produces vasodilation resulting in a reduction of supine and standing blood pressures. These decreases in blood pressure are not accompanied by a significant change in heart rate or plasma catecholamine levels with chronic dosing. Although the acute intravenous administration of amlodipine decreases arterial blood pressure and increases heart rate in hemodynamic studies of patients with chronic stable angina, chronic oral administration of amlodipine in clinical trials did not lead to clinically significant changes in heart rate or blood pressures in normotensive patients with angina.

With chronic once daily oral administration, antihypertensive effectiveness is maintained for at least 24 hours. Plasma concentrations correlate with effect in both young and elderly patients. The magnitude of reduction in blood pressure with amlodipine is also correlated with the height of pretreatment elevation; thus, individuals with moderate hypertension (diastolic pressure 105–114 mmHg) had about a 50% greater response than patients with mild hypertension (diastolic pressure 90–104 mmHg). Normotensive subjects experienced no clinically significant change in blood pressures (+1/-2 mmHg).

In hypertensive patients with normal renal function, therapeutic doses of amlodipine resulted in a decrease in renal vascular resistance and an increase in glomerular filtration rate and effective renal plasma flow without change in filtration fraction or proteinuria.

As with other calcium channel blockers, hemodynamic measurements of cardiac function at rest and during exercise (or pacing) in patients with normal ventricular function treated with amlodipine have generally demonstrated a small increase in cardiac index without significant influence on dP/dt or on left ventricular end diastolic pressure or volume. In hemodynamic studies, amlodipine has not been associated with a negative inotropic effect when administered in the therapeutic dose range to intact animals and man, even when co-administered with beta-blockers to man. Similar findings, however, have been observed in normals or well-compensated patients with heart failure with agents possessing significant negative inotropic effects.

Electrophysiologic Effects

Amlodipine does not change sinoatrial nodal function or atrioventricular conduction in intact animals or man. In patients with chronic stable angina, intravenous administration of 10 mg did not significantly alter A-H and H-V conduction and sinus node recovery time after pacing. Similar results were obtained in patients receiving amlodipine and concomitant beta-blockers. In clinical studies in which amlodipine was administered in combination with beta-blockers to patients with either hypertension or angina, no adverse effects on electrocardiographic parameters were observed. In clinical trials with angina patients alone, amlodipine besylate therapy did not alter electrocardiographic intervals or produce higher degrees of AV blocks.

14.2 Amlodipine

The antihypertensive efficacy of amlodipine has been demonstrated in a total of 15 double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized studies involving 800 patients on amlodipine and 538 on placebo. Once daily administration produced statistically significant placebo-corrected reductions in supine and standing blood pressures at 24 hours post-dose, averaging about 12/6 mmHg in the standing position and 13/7 mmHg in the supine position in patients with mild to moderate hypertension. Maintenance of the blood pressure effect over the 24-hour dosing interval was observed, with little difference in peak and trough effect.

14.3 Olmesartan Medoxomil

The antihypertensive effects of olmesartan medoxomil have been demonstrated in seven placebo-controlled studies at doses ranging from 2.5 mg to 80 mg for 6 to 12 weeks, each showing statistically significant reductions in peak and trough blood pressure. A total of 2693 patients (2145 olmesartan medoxomil; 548 placebo) with essential hypertension were studied. The blood pressure lowering effect was maintained throughout the 24-hour period with olmesartan medoxomil once daily, with trough-to-peak ratios for systolic and diastolic response between 60% and 80%.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Amlodipine. Following administration of therapeutic doses to patients with hypertension, amlodipine produces vasodilation resulting in a reduction of supine and standing blood pressures. These decreases in blood pressure are not accompanied by a significant change in heart rate or plasma catecholamine levels with chronic dosing.

With chronic once daily oral administration, antihypertensive effectiveness is maintained for at least 24 hours. Plasma concentrations correlate with effect in both young and elderly patients. The magnitude of reduction in blood pressure with amlodipine is also correlated with the height of pretreatment elevation; thus, individuals with moderate hypertension (diastolic pressure 105–114 mmHg) had about a 50% greater response than patients with mild hypertension (diastolic pressure 90–104 mmHg). Normotensive subjects experienced no clinically significant change in blood pressures (+1/-2 mmHg). In hypertensive patients with normal renal function, therapeutic doses of amlodipine resulted in a decrease in renal vascular resistance and an increase in glomerular filtration rate and effective renal plasma flow without change in filtration fraction or proteinuria.

As with other calcium channel blockers, hemodynamic measurements of cardiac function at rest and during exercise (or pacing) in patients with normal ventricular function treated with amlodipine have generally demonstrated a small increase in cardiac index without significant influence on dP/dt or on left ventricular end diastolic pressure or volume. In hemodynamic studies, amlodipine has not been associated with a negative inotropic effect when administered in the therapeutic dose range to intact animals and man, even when co-administered with beta-blockers to man. Similar findings, however, have been observed in normals or well-compensated patients with heart failure with agents possessing significant negative inotropic effects.

Amlodipine does not change sinoatrial nodal function or atrioventricular conduction in intact animals or man. In clinical studies in which amlodipine was administered in combination with beta-blockers to patients with either hypertension or angina, no adverse effects on electrocardiographic parameters were observed.

Olmesartan medoxomil. Olmesartan medoxomil doses of 2.5 mg to 40 mg inhibit the pressor effects of angiotensin I infusion. The duration of the inhibitory effect was related to dose, with doses of olmesartan medoxomil > 40 mg giving > 90% inhibition at 24 hours.

Plasma concentrations of angiotensin I and angiotensin II and plasma renin activity (PRA) increase after single and repeated administration of olmesartan medoxomil to healthy subjects and hypertensive patients. Repeated administration of up to 80 mg olmesartan medoxomil had minimal influence on aldosterone levels and no effect on serum potassium.

Statistical Analysis

It was calculated that the enrollment of 200 participants would provide > 90% power to detect a conservative change in SBP of 3.0 mm Hg from baseline to EOT with an SD of SBP change of 11 mm Hg, at the 5% significance level. Assumptions for SD were taken from the PATHWAY‐2 (Prevention and Treatment of Hypertension With Algorithm Based Therapy‐2) trial, where a 4.1 mm Hg change in SBP was observed from baseline in the placebo arm. This sample size allowed for > 20% missing data from either loss to follow‐up or noncompliance while maintaining at least 90% power.

For the primary outcome of change in SBP from baseline to EOT in the intervention cohort, a participant's mean SBP was calculated at baseline and each scheduled visit up to EOT visit, as the mean of 7 days of SBP measurements preceding each visit, including all available BP entries for each participant during those time periods. First, all available BP values were used within a single routine to calculate a mean for that routine (ie, morning and evening each day were separate routines). Each BP routine would ask the patient for 3 BP measurements, with a fourth measurement prompted to be taken if the first 3 were substantially varied. A mean for a specific time point, for example, at baseline or EOT, was then calculated as the mean of all routine means over the 7 days (maximum of 14 routines) for each participant.

The primary end point was analyzed using a linear mixed effects model. The outcome in the model was SBP level and contained a fixed effect for visit, including baseline and each scheduled consultation up to EOT, and a random intercept component at the participant level to account for correlation between SBP measurements across visits within the same participant. The mean change in SBP between baseline visit and EOT visit was estimated from the model as the difference between SBP level at EOT and baseline, along with 95% CI and P value.

All 205 intervention participants who had BP measurements at least at 1 time point were included in the main intention‐to‐treat analysis. The primary end point was reanalyzed for a per protocol population consisting of intervention participants who had at least 24 BP measurements in the 7‐day window preceding EOT visit.

Hypertension is a common finding in patients ≥ 65 years of age that contributes to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, but many patients are untreated or their hypertension inadequately controlled. Recent randomized controlled studies have demonstrated the benefits of treating hypertension in the elderly.

Objective

This study was undertaken to assess the efficacy and tolerability of amlodipine, a long-acting calcium channel blocker, in elderly (≥ 65 years of age) patients with mild to moderate hypertension (diastolic blood pressure 95 to 114 mm Hg).

Methods

This was an open-label, multicenter, 10-week, general-practice study involving patients > 18 years of age. Patients with malignant or secondary hypertension or unstable angina were excluded, as were those who had experienced an acute myocardial infarction or stroke in the preceding 3 months or had been treated with an alpha-blocker in the preceding 6 months. Patients were assigned to 1 of 4 treatment schedules: amlodipine monotherapy or combination therapy and amlodipine given once daily in the morning or in the evening. Approximately 50% of patients would receive a morning dose, and approximately 80% would receive amlodipine as monotherapy. The paired t test was used to assess the significance of differences from baseline values, with significance set at P < 0.05.

Results

A total of 5135 patients received amlodipine and were included in the tolerability analysis. Of these, 3511 of 3628 patients (96.8%) < 65 years and 1471 of 1507 patients (97.6%) ≥ 65 years (including 336 of 349 [96.3%] ≥ 75 years) were included in the efficacy analysis. Significant reductions (P < 0.05) in blood pressure were noted in all groups after 4 and 8 weeks of treatment. The equivalence of efficacy in all age groups was seen in terms of reduction in blood pressure (reduction of 21/15 mm Hg in patients < 65 years of age, 25/16 mm Hg in those ≥ 65 years of age, and 26/17 mm Hg in those ≥ 75 years of age) compared with baseline. Therapy was successful in 2878 patients (82.0%) < 65 years of age, in 1238 patients (84.2%) ≥ 65 years of age, and in 284 patients (84.5%) ≥ 75 years of age. The incidence of adverse events was similar in all age groups (18.0%, < 65 years; 22.3%, ≥ 65 years; and 24.1%, ≥ 75 years), with no statistically significant differences between groups. Tolerability was rated as good or excellent in all patients, with no significant differences between groups.

Conclusions

Once-daily amlodipine was effective in the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension in this patient population and demonstrated a low frequency of adverse events, a high degree of tolerability, and improved well-being. Morning rather than evening dosing appeared to confer a slight advantage.

### The effects of missed doses of amlodipine and losartan on blood pressure in older hypertensive patients [^114mcgbU]. Hypertension Research (2017). Low credibility.

This randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, multicenter study compared the efficacy of amlodipine and losartan in an older hypertensive population, focusing on therapeutic coverage in the case of missed doses. Following a 4-week, single-blind, placebo washout period, 211 patients were randomly assigned to receive either 5mg of amlodipine once daily or 50mg of losartan once daily. Doses were doubled after 6 weeks of treatment if the diastolic blood pressure exceeded 90mmHg. After the 12-week treatment period, patients received the placebo for 2 days (drug holiday) to simulate two missed doses of antihypertensive medication. Twenty-four-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring was conducted at the end of the placebo washout period (baseline), upon completion of the 12-week treatment period (steady state), and after the 2-day drug holiday. Amlodipine was more effective than losartan in reducing patients' 24-h ambulatory blood pressure at the steady-state sampling time. The increases in 24-h blood pressure during the drug holiday averaged 6 ± 2/2 ± 1mmHg (P < 0.0001) in the amlodipine group and 3 ± 2/2 ± 1mmHg (P < 0.0001) in the losartan group. The rise in systolic pressure was greater in patients on amlodipine than in those on losartan (P < 0.0001). For diastolic pressure, the changes did not differ. Owing to the lower pressure during treatment, patients in the amlodipine group remained at a significantly lower blood pressure level after the 2-day drug holiday. Amlodipine was more effective than losartan in lowering blood pressure and in maintaining blood pressure control after two missed doses, and the difference was most significant for systolic blood pressure.

### Amlodipine besylate (amlodipine) [^115Ln5Wj]. FDA (2013). Low credibility.

Adult Patients

The antihypertensive efficacy of amlodipine has been demonstrated in a total of 15 double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized studies involving 800 patients on amlodipine and 538 on placebo. Once daily administration produced statistically significant placebo-corrected reductions in supine and standing blood pressures at 24 hours postdose, averaging about 12/6 mmHg in the standing position and 13/7 mmHg in the supine position in patients with mild to moderate hypertension. Maintenance of the blood pressure effect over the 24-hour dosing interval was observed, with little difference in peak and trough effect. Tolerance was not demonstrated in patients studied for up to 1 year. The 3 parallel, fixed dose, dose response studies showed that the reduction in supine and standing blood pressures was dose-related within the recommended dosing range. Effects on diastolic pressure were similar in young and older patients. The effect on systolic pressure was greater in older patients, perhaps because of greater baseline systolic pressure. Effects were similar in black patients and in white patients.

Pediatric Patients

Two hundred sixty-eight hypertensive patients aged 6 to 17 years were randomized first to amlodipine 2.5 or 5 mg once daily for 4 weeks and then randomized again to the same dose or to placebo for another 4 weeks. Patients receiving 5 mg at the end of 8 weeks had lower blood pressure than those secondarily randomized to placebo. The magnitude of the treatment effect is difficult to interpret, but it is probably less than 5 mmHg systolic on the 5 mg dose. Adverse events were similar to those seen in adults.

Effects in Chronic Stable Angina

The effectiveness of 5 to 10 mg/day of amlodipine in exercise-induced angina has been evaluated in 8 placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trials of up to 6 weeks duration involving 1038 patients (684 amlodipine, 354 placebo) with chronic stable angina. In 5 of the 8 studies significant increases in exercise time (bicycle or treadmill) were seen with the 10 mg dose. Increases in symptom-limited exercise time averaged 12.8% (63 sec) for amlodipine 10 mg, and averaged 7.9% (38 sec) for amlodipine 5 mg. Amlodipine 10 mg also increased time to 1 mm ST segment deviation in several studies and decreased angina attack rate. The sustained efficacy of amlodipine in angina patients has been demonstrated over long-term dosing. In patients with angina there were no clinically significant reductions in blood pressures (4/1 mmHg) or changes in heart rate (+0.3 bpm).

### Recommendations for management of clinically significant drug-drug interactions with statins and select agents used in patients with cardiovascular disease: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^112LfufX]. Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

Summary of evidence — statin–calcium channel blocker drug–drug interactions (DDIs) indicates the following: Pharmacokinetic data suggest a minor increase in statin exposure with coadministration of amlodipine and lovastatin or simvastatin, and combination therapy may be considered; there is no evidence of significant interaction when amlodipine is coadministered with other statins; combination therapy with atorvastatin and diltiazem results in a minor increase in statin exposure and is reasonable in appropriate patients; interactions between diltiazem and either lovastatin or simvastatin are associated with moderate increases in statin exposure, although combination therapy may be considered in appropriate patients; DDIs with verapamil and lovastatin or simvastatin are also of moderate intensity, and combination therapy may be considered when the potential for benefit outweighs potential risks.

European Heart Journal (2009). Medium credibility.

Calcium channel blockers in idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH) — nifedipine, diltiazem, and amlodipine — have reported efficacy at relatively high daily doses, specifically 120–240 mg for nifedipine, 240–720 mg for diltiazem, and up to 20 mg for amlodipine; it is advisable to start with a low dose (e.g., 30 mg of slow release nifedipine twice a day, 60 mg of diltiazem three times a day (t.i.d.), or 2.5 mg of amlodipine once a day) and increase cautiously, and patients who respond "should be followed closely… with an initial re-assessment after 3–4 months of therapy including RHC". An adequate response is defined as being in WHO-FC I or II with a marked haemodynamic improvement, otherwise "a PAH therapy should be instituted", and patients without a positive vasoreactivity study "should not be started on a CCB". Use is limited as only a small number of IPAH patients do well with CCBs, and in connective tissue disease, vasodilator responsiveness does not predict a favourable long-term response with high-dose CCBs often not well tolerated.

### Amlodipine besylate and valsartan (Amlodipine and valsartan) [^115FxvjK]. FDA (2018). Low credibility.

2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

General Considerations:

Majority of effect attained within 2 weeks (2.1)
May be administered with other antihypertensive agents (2.1)

Hypertension:

May be used as add-on therapy for patients not controlled on monotherapy (2.2)
Patients who experience dose-limiting adverse reactions on monotherapy may be switched to amlodipine and valsartan tablets containing a lower dose of that component (2.2)
May be substituted for titrated components (2.3)
When used as initial therapy: Initiate with 5/160 mg, then titrate upwards as necessary to a maximum of 10/320 mg once daily (2.4)

2.1 General Considerations

Dose once daily. The dosage can be increased after 1 to 2 weeks of therapy to a maximum of one 10/320 mg tablet once daily as needed to control blood pressure. The majority of the antihypertensive effect is attained within 2 weeks after initiation of therapy or a change in dose.

Amlodipine and valsartan tablets may be administered with or without food.

Amlodipine and valsartan tablets may be administered with other antihypertensive agents.

2.2 Add-on Therapy

A patient whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled with amlodipine (or another dihydropyridine calcium-channel blocker) alone or with valsartan (or another angiotensin II receptor blocker) alone may be switched to combination therapy with amlodipine and valsartan tablets.

A patient who experiences dose-limiting adverse reactions on either component alone may be switched to amlodipine and valsartan tablets containing a lower dose of that component in combination with the other to achieve similar blood pressure reductions. The clinical response to amlodipine and valsartan tablets should be subsequently evaluated and if blood pressure remains uncontrolled after 3 to 4 weeks of therapy, the dose may be titrated up to a maximum of 10/320 mg.

2.3 Replacement Therapy

For convenience, patients receiving amlodipine and valsartan from separate tablets may instead wish to receive amlodipine and valsartan tablets containing the same component doses.

2.4 Initial Therapy

A patient may be initiated on amlodipine and valsartan tablets if it is unlikely that control of blood pressure would be achieved with a single agent. The usual starting dose is amlodipine and valsartan tablets 5/160 mg once daily in patients who are not volume-depleted.

### Results of a multicenter, 8-week, parallel-group, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, phase III clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of amlodipine maleate versus amlodipine besylate in Korean patients with mild to moderate hypertension [^116tJzMj]. Clinical Therapeutics (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Recently, amlodipine maleate was developed and tested in preclinical and Phase I clinical trials in Korea. The studies found pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics similar to those of amlodipine besylate.

Objective

The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy and tolerability of amlodipine maleate with those of amlodipine besylate in Korean patients with mild to moderate hypertension.

Methods

This was a multicenter, 8-week, parallel-group, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, Phase III clinical trial. Eligible patients were Korean, aged 18 to 75 years, had hypertension, and were either taking antihypertensive medications or had a documented sitting diastolic blood pressure of 90 to 109 mm Hg. After a washout period of 2 weeks, patients were randomized to amlodipine maleate or amlodipine besylate for 8 weeks. In both groups, the medications were initiated at 5 mg QD. At day 29, the medication dose was increased to 10 mg QD if sitting diastolic blood pressure (SiDBP) was ≥ 90 mm Hg.

Results

One hundred eighteen patients were enrolled. Fifty-seven patients received amlodipine maleate (29 men, 28 women; mean [SD] age, 49.0 [11.4] years) and 61 received amlodipine besylate (35 men, 26 women; mean [SD] age, 51.6 [9.4] years). Baseline mean (SD) values for sitting systolic blood pressure and SiDBP were 152.0 (12.2) mm Hg and 98.1 (5.6) mm Hg, respectively, for the amlodipine maleate group and 153.4 (14.0) mm Hg and 98.1 (5.5) mm Hg, respectively, for the amlodipine besylate group. In this population, amlodipine maleate was not inferior to amlodipine besylate: the lower limit of the 2-sided 95% CI for the treatment difference in SiDBP was greater than -4 mm Hg. The between-group difference in SiDBP response rate (the proportion of patients who experienced adequate SiDBP reductions) did not reach statistical significance: 85.7% (42/49) for the amlodipine maleate group and 91.8% (45/49) for the amlodipine besylate group. Compliance rates were similar between groups, with mean (SD) compliance rates of 97.4% (2.8%) and 97.1% (3.6%) in the amlodipine maleate and amlodipine besylate groups, respectively. Also, there were no significant differences in the incidences of drug-related clinical and laboratory adverse events; the most common were headache, flushing, facial edema, and paresthesia.

Conclusion

In this population, the efficacy and tolerability observed with amlodipine maleate were similar to those seen with amlodipine besylate.

### Amlodipine besylate and benazepril hydrochloride [^11529dSJ]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Usual starting dose is 2.5/10 mg. (2.1)
May be used as add-on therapy for patients not adequately controlled with either a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker or an ACE inhibitor. (2.2)
Patients who experience edema with amlodipine may be switched to amlodipine and benazepril hydrochloride capsules containing a lower dose of amlodipine. (2.1)

2.1 General Considerations

The recommended initial dose of amlodipine and benazepril hydrochloride capsules is 1 capsule of amlodipine 2.5 mg/benazepril 10 mg orally once-daily.

Begin therapy with amlodipine and benazepril hydrochloride capsules only after a patient has either (a) failed to achieve the desired antihypertensive effect with amlodipine or benazepril monotherapy, or (b) demonstrated inability to achieve adequate antihypertensive effect with amlodipine therapy without developing edema.

The antihypertensive effect of amlodipine and benazepril hydrochloride capsules is largely attained within 2 weeks. If blood pressure remains uncontrolled, the dose may be titrated up to amlodipine 10 mg/benazepril 40 mg once-daily. The dosing should be individualized and adjusted according to the patient's clinical response.

In clinical trials of amlodipine/benazepril combination therapy using amlodipine doses of 2.5 mg to 10 mg and benazepril doses of 10 mg to 40 mg, the antihypertensive effects increased with increasing dose of amlodipine in all patient groups, and the effects increased with increasing dose of benazepril in nonblack groups.

2.2 Replacement Therapy

Amlodipine and benazepril hydrochloride capsules may be substituted for the titrated components.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Amlodipine

Following administration of therapeutic doses to patients with hypertension, amlodipine produces vasodilation resulting in a reduction of supine and standing blood pressures. These decreases in blood pressure are not accompanied by a significant change in heart rate or plasma catecholamine levels with chronic dosing. Although the acute intravenous administration of amlodipine decreases arterial blood pressure and increases heart rate in hemodynamic studies of patients with chronic stable angina, chronic oral administration of amlodipine in clinical trials did not lead to clinically significant changes in heart rate or blood pressures in normotensive patients with angina.

With chronic once daily oral administration, antihypertensive effectiveness is maintained for at least 24 hours. Plasma concentrations correlate with effect in both young and elderly patients. The magnitude of reduction in blood pressure with amlodipine is also correlated with the height of pretreatment elevation; thus, individuals with moderate hypertension (diastolic pressure 105 to 114 mmHg) had about a 50% greater response than patients with mild hypertension (diastolic pressure 90 to 104 mmHg). Normotensive subjects experienced no clinically significant change in blood pressures (+1/–2 mmHg).

In hypertensive patients with normal renal function, therapeutic doses of amlodipine resulted in a decrease in renal vascular resistance and an increase in glomerular filtration rate and effective renal plasma flow without change in filtration fraction or proteinuria.

Outcomes

The primary outcome was the mean change in SBP. This was measured daily at home from baseline to the end of treatment (EOT, Week 14) comparing 7‐day mean SBP at baseline (minimum of 24 values) to 7‐day SBP mean at EOT.

Secondary outcomes included: mean change in daily DBP (measured as previously described for SBP); proportion of participants reaching BP targets (either SBP < 135 mm Hg and DBP < 85 mm Hg, or drop in SBP ≥ 10 mm Hg, or drop in DBP ≥ 5 mm Hg) by EOT; treatment‐emergent AEs defined as AEs that were considered at least possibly related to trial treatment; reports of side effects using the app; patient‐reported outcome data including user experience; adherence to medication (% intervention participants reporting adherence to prescribed amlodipine dose on 80% or more days); adherence to BP monitoring routines (% participants making a BP record entry on 80% or more occasions, based on 2 occasions/day). The observation cohort was not designed to assess adherence to participants' background medication usage nor incidence of side effects given the large variation in number and drug class of antihypertensive background medications in use.

Data Collection

After completion of a run‐in period of 5 to 7 days, participants' home BP (morning and evening), drug dose, and side effects were recorded daily via the app for a period of up to 14 weeks.

### Plasma trough concentrations of antihypertensive drugs for the assessment of treatment adherence: a meta-analysis [^112JBbze]. Hypertension (2021). Medium credibility.

Perspectives

Then, how are we supposed to apply our findings into clinical practice? The goal of biochemical adherence assessment is to accurately distinguish between adherent and nonadherent patients and to use this information in a shared decision-making approach to ultimately improve drug adherence and BP control. To implement quantitative screening in daily clinical practice, reliable cutoff values are required. As illustrated in our meta-analysis, trough concentrations of the 3 different antihypertensive drugs are highly variable, which means that a drug concentration below the trough concentration could also be the result of a deviation from typical pharmacokinetics. Therefore, trough concentrations are not suitable as cutoff values for the quantitative biochemical assessment of drug adherence as this increases the risk of misclassification of adherent patients as nonadherent. Performing biochemical assessment in urine instead of plasma will even further increase the risk of misclassification as some antihypertensive drugs are extensively metabolized or have a low urinary excretion. Addressing of nonadherence in patients that are adherent could seriously harm the patient-physician relationship, might work counterproductive in adherence management, and should therefore be prevented. Hence, as long as a reliable cutoff value for quantitative drug screening is lacking a conservative approach is preferred and biochemical assessment of adherence should be performed qualitatively.

In conclusion, the plasma trough concentrations of amlodipine, hydrochlorothiazide, and valsartan are highly heterogeneous. Use of the pooled trough concentrations, retrieved by our meta-analysis, as a cutoff for the biochemical assessment of adherence in clinical practice is therefore not recommended. Before implementation of a quantitative drug screening into clinical practice, drug-, dose-, and patient-specific lower limits based on individual patient data from pharmacokinetic studies are needed, to take into account factors that influence drug exposure.

8.5 Geriatric Use

In controlled clinical trials, 323 (22.5%) hypertensive patients treated with amlodipine and valsartan were ≥ 65 years and 79 (5.5%) were ≥ 75 years. No overall differences in the efficacy or safety of amlodipine and valsartan was observed in this patient population, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.

Amlodipine: The recommended starting dose of amlodipine 2.5 mg is not an available strength with amlodipine and valsartan.

Clinical studies of amlodipine besylate tablets did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Elderly patients have decreased clearance of amlodipine with a resulting increase of area under the curve (AUC) of approximately 40% to 60%.

Valsartan: In the controlled clinical trials of valsartan, 1214 (36.2%) of hypertensive patients treated with valsartan were ≥ 65 years and 265 (7.9%) were ≥ 75 years. No overall difference in the efficacy or safety of valsartan was observed in this patient population, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.

8.6 Renal Impairment

Safety and effectiveness of amlodipine and valsartan in patients with severe renal impairment (CrCl < 30 mL/min) have not been established. No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild (CrCl 60 to 90 mL/min) or moderate (CrCl 30 to 60 mL/min) renal impairment.

8.7 Hepatic Impairment

Amlodipine

Exposure to amlodipine is increased in patients with hepatic insufficiency [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The recommended initial dose of amlodipine in patients with hepatic impairment is 2.5 mg, which is not an available strength with amlodipine and valsartan.

Valsartan

No dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mild-to-moderate disease. No dosing recommendations can be provided for patients with severe liver disease.

14.1	Amlodipine for Hypertension

Adult Patients

The antihypertensive efficacy of amlodipine has been demonstrated in a total of 15 double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized studies involving 800 patients on amlodipine and 538 on placebo. Once daily administration produced statistically significant placebo-corrected reductions in supine and standing blood pressures at 24 hours postdose, averaging about 12/6 mmHg in the standing position and 13/7 mmHg in the supine position in patients with mild to moderate hypertension. Maintenance of the blood pressure effect over the 24-hour dosing interval was observed, with little difference in peak and trough effect. Tolerance was not demonstrated in patients studied for up to 1 year. The 3 parallel, fixed dose, dose response studies showed that the reduction in supine and standing blood pressures was dose related within the recommended dosing range. Effects on diastolic pressure were similar in young and older patients. The effect on systolic pressure was greater in older patients, perhaps because of greater baseline systolic pressure. Effects were similar in black patients and in white patients.

Pediatric Patients

Two hundred sixty-eight hypertensive patients aged 6 to 17 years were randomized first to amlodipine 2.5 or 5 mg once daily for 4 weeks and then randomized again to the same dose or to placebo for another 4 weeks. Patients receiving 2.5 mg or 5 mg at the end of 8 weeks had significantly lower systolic blood pressure than those secondarily randomized to placebo. The magnitude of the treatment effect is difficult to interpret, but it is probably less than 5 mmHg systolic on the 5 mg dose and 3.3 mmHg systolic on the 2.5 mg dose. Adverse events were similar to those seen in adults.

14.2 Amlodipine

The antihypertensive efficacy of amlodipine has been demonstrated in a total of 15 double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized studies involving 800 patients on amlodipine and 538 on placebo. Once daily administration produced statistically significant placebo-corrected reductions in supine and standing blood pressures at 24 hours post-dose, averaging about 12/6 mmHg in the standing position and 13/7 mmHg in the supine position in patients with mild to moderate hypertension. Maintenance of the blood pressure effect over the 24-hour dosing interval was observed, with little difference in peak and trough effect.

14.3 Olmesartan Medoxomil

The antihypertensive effects of olmesartan medoxomil have been demonstrated in seven placebo-controlled studies at doses ranging from 2.5 mg to 80 mg for 6 to 12 weeks, each showing statistically significant reductions in peak and trough blood pressure. A total of 2693 patients (2145 olmesartan medoxomil; 548 placebo) with essential hypertension were studied. The blood pressure lowering effect was maintained throughout the 24-hour period with olmesartan medoxomil once daily, with trough-to-peak ratios for systolic and diastolic response between 60% and 80%.

### Effects of dividing amlodipine daily doses on trough drug concentrations and blood pressure control over a 24-hour period [^114DShAh]. Clinical Therapeutics (2013). Low credibility.

Background

In the treatment of hypertension, once-daily administration of long-acting antihypertensive drugs has been recommended for the improvement of treatment adherence; however, it is unclear whether dividing daily doses has the additional benefit of more ideal blood pressure (BP) control over a 24-hour period.

Objective

The aim of the study was to investigate whether dividing a 10-mg daily dose of amlodipine, a long-acting calcium channel blocker, is associated with increased trough plasma amlodipine concentrations, reduced arterial stiffness, and improved BP control over a 24-hour period.

Methods

Outpatients with essential hypertension were included this open-label, 2-period crossover study. The patients were administered amlodipine 10 mg/d in 2 divided doses for 8 weeks. At week 4, blood was collected just before amlodipine administration for the evaluation of trough plasma amlodipine concentrations. At week 8, 24-hour, daytime, nighttime, and early morning BP, as well as arterial stiffness, were measured using ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) and cardio-ankle vascular index (CAVI), respectively. In the subsequent study period, amlodipine 10 mg/d was administered once daily, and the same tests were performed at the same timings as in period 1.

Results

Ten patients were enrolled (7 men, 3 women; mean age, 61.0 [15.3] years). Mean 24-hour BP with twice-daily administration was not significantly lower than that with once-daily administration (129.7 [7.3]/80.1 [7.9] mm Hg vs 130.5 [11.8]/80.1 [7.9] mm Hg, respectively). Similarly, there were no significant differences in daytime, nighttime, or early morning BP between twice- and once-daily administration. In addition, the differences in trough plasma amlodipine concentrations (22.37 [7.66] ng/mL vs 20.57 [8.22] ng/mL) and CAVI values (8.2 [1.8] vs 8.5 [1.0]) were not significantly different between twice- and once-daily administration.

Conclusions

Administering amlodipine in 2 divided doses was not associated with increased trough plasma amlodipine concentrations, reduced arterial stiffness, or improved BP control over a 24-hour period in patients with essential hypertension.

8.4 Pediatric Use

The safety and effectiveness of amlodipine besylate and atorvastatin calcium have not been established in pediatric populations.

Amlodipine

Amlodipine (2.5 to 5 mg daily) is effective in lowering blood pressure in patients 6 to 17 years [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. The effect of amlodipine on blood pressure in patients less than 6 years of age is not known.

Atorvastatin

Heterozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia (HeFH)

Safety and effectiveness of atorvastatin have been established in patients 10 years to 17 years of age with HeFH as an adjunct to diet to reduce total cholesterol, LDL-C, and apo B levels when, after an adequate trial of diet therapy, the following are present:

- LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL, or

- LDL-C ≥ 160 mg/dL and

a positive family history of FH, or premature CVD in a first, or second-degree relative, or
two or more other CVD risk factors are present.

Use of atorvastatin for this indication is supported by evidence from [see Dosage and Administration (2), Adverse Reactions (6.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), and Clinical Studies (14.11)]:

- A placebo-controlled clinical trial of 6 months duration in 187 boys and postmenarchal girls, 10 years to 17 years of age. Patients treated with 10 mg or 20 mg daily atorvastatin had an adverse reaction profile generally similar to that of patients treated with placebo. In this limited controlled study, there was no significant effect on growth or sexual maturation in boys or on menstrual cycle length in girls

- A three year open-label uncontrolled trial that included 163 pediatric patients 10 to 15 years of age with HeFH who were titrated to achieve a target LDL-C < 130 mg/dL. The safety and efficacy of atorvastatin in lowering LDL-C appeared generally consistent with that observed for adult patients, despite limitations of the uncontrolled study design.

Advise postmenarchal girls of contraception recommendations, if appropriate for the patient [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

The long-term efficacy of atorvastatin therapy initiated in childhood to reduce morbidity and mortality in adulthood has not been established.

The safety and efficacy of atorvastatin have not been established in pediatric patients younger than 10 years of age with HeFH.

Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia (HoFH)

Clinical efficacy of atorvastatin with dosages up to 80 mg/day for 1 year was evaluated in an uncontrolled study of patients with HoFH including 8 pediatric patients [see Clinical Studies (14.10)].

### A randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, parallel-group comparison of valsartan and amlodipine in the treatment of isolated systolic hypertension in elderly patients: the val-syst study [^115HL7HV]. Clinical Therapeutics (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Some antihypertensive therapies are limited by dose-dependent adverse effects (AEs). The angiotensin II receptor blocker valsartan has been shown to reduce blood pressure (BP) in a dose-related manner with minimal dose-limiting AEs. Amlodipine besylate is a potent dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker also with dose-related antihypertensive efficacy, but with possible dose-limiting AEs, particularly peripheral edema.

Objectives

This study compared the risk/benefit profiles of valsartan and amlodipine in elderly patients who have isolated systolic hypertension (ISH).

Methods

This 24-week, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, titration-to-effect, parallel-group study was conducted at 35 outpatient centers in Italy. Elderly (aged 60–80 years) patients with ISH received oral treatment with valsartan 80-mg capsules or amlodipine 5-mg capsules once daily. After 8 weeks of treatment, the dose of the patients with poorly controlled systolic BP (SBP) was titrated to 160 mg (valsartan) or 10 mg (amlodipine) once daily. At week 16, if trough SBP was still not adequately controlled, a low-dose diuretic (hydrochlorothiazide [HCTZ] 12.5 mg) was added to the treatment regimen for an additional 8 weeks. Tolerability was assessed at all study visits using physical examination and patient interview.

Results

Of 421 randomized patients (231 women, 190 men; mean [SD] age, 69 [6] years), 208 were included in the valsartan group, and 213 in the amlodipine group. The efficacy of valsartan-based treatment. in reducing SBP was similar to that of amlodipine-based treatment. With doubled doses, efficacy (change in SBP) increased significantly from baseline (both P < 0.01). The frequency of AEs doubled with amlodipine 10 mg but was not clinically relevant with valsartan 160 mg. Overall, AEs were observed in 31.9% of those receiving amlodipine versus 20.2% of the patients receiving valsartan (P < 0.003), with peripheral edema rates of 26.8% and 4.8%, respectively (P < 0.001).

Conclusions

In this study population of elderly patients with ISH, valsartan-given alone or in combination with HCTZ 12.5 mg-showed similar efficacy but better tolerability than amlodipine-based treatment.

### Amlodipine besylate and benazepril hydrochloride [^114PpFbA]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Metabolism: Amlodipine is extensively (approximately 90%) metabolized in the liver to inactive metabolized. Benazepril is extensively metabolised to form benazeprilat as the main metabolite, which occurs by enzymatic hydrolysis, mainly in the liver. Two minor metabolites are the acyl glucuronide conjugates of benazepril and benazeprilat.

Elimination: Amlodipine elimination from plasma is biphasic with a terminal elimination half-life of approximately 30 to 50 hours. Steady-state plasma levels are reached after once-daily dosing for 7 to 8 days. Ten percent of unchanged drug and 60% of amlodipine metabolites are excreted in urine. Effective elimination half-life of amlodipine is 2 days. Benazepril is eliminated mainly by metabolic clearance. Benazeprilat is eliminated via the kidneys and the bile; renal excretion is the main route in patients with normal renal function. In the urine, benazepril accounts for less than 1% and benazeprilat for about 20% of an oral dose. Elimination of benazeprilat is biphasic with an initial half-life of about 3 hours and a terminal half-life of about 22 hours. Benazeprilat's effective elimination half-life is 10 to 11 hours, while that of amlodipine is about 2 days, so steady-state levels of the 2 components are achieved after about a week of once-daily dosing.

### Results of a phase III, 8-week, multicenter, prospective, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group clinical trial to assess the effects of amlodipine camsylate versus amlodipine besylate in Korean adults with mild to moderate hypertension [^113boLa5]. Clinical Therapeutics (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Amlodipine besylate has been used in Korea for the treatment of hypertension for > 17 years, with well-established efficacy and tolerability. Amlodipine camsylate is a newer formulation developed for generic use. It has been assessed in terms of physical stability and pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties and been found to be effective in lowering blood pressure in preclinical and Phase I and II trials. However, to date, no studies have compared the clinical effectiveness of amlodipine camsylate and amlodipine besylate in treating hypertension.

Objective

This study was designed to determine the effectiveness and tolerability of amlodipine camsylate compared with amlodipine besylate in Korean patients with mild to moderate hypertension.

Methods

This Phase III, 8-week, prospective, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study was conducted in 13 cardiology centers across the Republic of Korea. Male and female Korean patients aged 18 to 75 years having uncomplicated, mild to moderate, essential hypertension (sitting diastolic blood pressure [SiDBP] 90- < 110 mm Hg) and receiving no antihypertensives in the 2 weeks before randomization were eligible. Patients were randomly assigned to receive oral treatment with amlodipine camsylate or amlodipine besylate. For the first 4 weeks, patients received amlodipine 5 mg QD (morning). After 4 weeks, if either blood pressure was ≥ 140/ ≥ 90 mm Hg or SiDBP had not decreased by ≥ 10 mm Hg from baseline, the dose of amlodipine was increased to 10 mg QD for 4 weeks. Trough blood pressure and heart rate were measured in duplicate with the patient in the sitting position at each clinic visit (baseline [week 0] and weeks 4 and 8 of treatment); mean values were calculated and recorded. At weeks 4 and 8, tolerability was assessed using history taking and laboratory analysis, and compliance was assessed using pill counts. The primary end point was change from baseline in SiDBP at week 8. Secondary end points were change from baseline in sitting systolic blood pressure (SiSBP) at week 8 in the total population and in the subgroup of patients who had previously received antihypertensive treatment versus those who had not.

Results

A total of 189 patients were enrolled (mean age, 53 years; 105 women, 84 men; mean body weight, 65.8 kg). One patient in the amlodipine camsylate group dropped out of the study at week 0 of treatment (this patient did not use any study medication) and was excluded from the modified intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis. Thus, 188 patients were treated and included in the ITT analysis (94 patients per treatment group; ITT analysis); 161 patients were included in the perprotocol (PP) analysis (n = 80 for amlodipine camsylate, n = 81 for amlodipine besylate) (14 patients in the amlodipine camsylate group and 13 patients in the amlodipine besylate group were excluded from the PP analysis due to consistent withdrawal or protocol violation). Mean (SD) SiSBP and SiDBP were significantly decreased from baseline in both groups (amlodipine camsylate, from 146.7 [12.3]/96.6 [5.4] to 127.9 [14.8]/83.4 [7.7] mm Hg [both, P < 0.001]; amlodipine besylate, from 146.8 [12.8]/96.7 [5.1] to 128.0 [10.1]/83.8 [7.5] mm Hg [both, P < 0.001]). The differences in SiSBP/SiDBP between the 2 groups at week 8 were not significant. The SiDBP response rates in the subgroups that had and had not been previously treated with antihypertensives were statistically similar (56/69 [81.2%] and 83/92 [90.2%], respectively). The prevalences of clinical adverse events (AEs) were not significantly different between the 2 treatment groups (amlodipine camsylate, 27.3%; amlodipine besylate, 28.7%). The most common AEs were dizziness and dyspnea (both in 3/94 [3.2%] and 1/94 [1.1%] patients who received amlodipine camsylate and amlodipine besylate, respectively).

Conclusion

The effectiveness and tolerability of amlodipine camsylate were not significantly different from those of amlodipine besylate in these Korean adults with mild to moderate hypertension.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Amlodipine.

Following administration of therapeutic doses to patients with hypertension, amlodipine produces vasodilation resulting in a reduction of supine and standing blood pressures. These decreases in blood pressure are not accompanied by a significant change in heart rate or plasma catecholamine levels with chronic dosing.

With chronic once daily oral administration, antihypertensive effectiveness is maintained for at least 24 hours. Plasma concentrations correlate with effect in both young and elderly patients. The magnitude of reduction in blood pressure with amlodipine is also correlated with the height of pretreatment elevation; thus, individuals with moderate hypertension (diastolic pressure 105 to 114 mmHg) had about a 50% greater response than patients with mild hypertension (diastolic pressure 90 to 104 mmHg). Normotensive subjects experienced no clinically significant change in blood pressures (+1/-2 mmHg).

In hypertensive patients with normal renal function, therapeutic doses of amlodipine resulted in a decrease in renal vascular resistance and an increase in glomerular filtration rate and effective renal plasma flow without change in filtration fraction or proteinuria.

As with other calcium channel blockers, hemodynamic measurements of cardiac function at rest and during exercise (or pacing) in patients with normal ventricular function treated with amlodipine have generally demonstrated a small increase in cardiac index without significant influence on dP/dt or on left ventricular end diastolic pressure or volume. In hemodynamic studies, amlodipine has not been associated with a negative inotropic effect when administered in the therapeutic dose range to intact animals and man, even when co-administered with beta-blockers to man. Similar findings, however, have been observed in normals or well-compensated patients with heart failure with agents possessing significant negative inotropic effects.

Amlodipine does not change sinoatrial nodal function or atrioventricular conduction in intact animals or man. In clinical studies in which amlodipine was administered in combination with beta-blockers to patients with either hypertension or angina, no adverse effects on electrocardiographic parameters were observed.

Olmesartan medoxomil. Olmesartan medoxomil doses of 2.5 mg to 40 mg inhibit the pressor effects of angiotensin I infusion. The duration of the inhibitory effect was related to dose, with doses of olmesartan medoxomil > 40 mg giving > 90% inhibition at 24 hours.

Plasma concentrations of angiotensin I and angiotensin II and plasma renin activity (PRA) increase after single and repeated administration of olmesartan medoxomil to healthy subjects and hypertensive patients. Repeated administration of up to 80 mg olmesartan medoxomil had minimal influence on aldosterone levels and no effect on serum potassium.

Monitor AEs (DHP CCBs may cause ankle edema, dizziness, flushing, headache, constipation), and use with caution in patients with hepatic (CCBs) or kidney (non-DHP CCBs) dysfunction. Non-DHP CCBs may be considered for rate control in supraventricular tachycardia or atrial fibrillation/flutter. Verapamil may cause constipation; verapamil is contraindicated 2nd or 3rd degree AV block, severe LV dysfunction. Diltiazem may decrease sinus rate; diltiazem is contraindicated in 2nd or 3rd degree AV block; use with caution in LV dysfunction. Verapamil or diltiazem should not usually be used with a beta-blocker due to risk of severe bradycardia or heart block.

### Time of administration important? Morning versus evening dosing of valsartan [^1145CA8X]. Journal of Hypertension (2015). Low credibility.

The pharmacologic rationale for more effective BP lowering with evening dosing of antihypertensive therapy presupposes the inability of morning dosing to effectively lower BP at night and during the early morning period. This cannot be supported, however, as studies that evaluated morning versus evening administration of amlodipine, a long-acting calcium channel blocker (circulating half-life > 24 h), reported no benefit of evening versus morning dosing. Perhaps dosing of the antihypertensive agent is important. The question remains, did the use of higher doses of valsartan (160, 320 mg) in this study help to maintain the 24-h BP-lowering effect, whereas the use of lower or suboptimal doses would have exposed a weakness in morning dosing? Support for this comes from a study wherein less-effective BP lowering at the end of the dosing period was reported with either morning or evening administration when using a low dose of a RAAS blocker. Alternatively, the benefit of evening dosing of antihypertensive therapy, particularly for ARBs, may be related to the need for more effective RAAS blockade during the evening period as RAAS activity is increased during the night. For example, a previous study demonstrated more effective night-time control of BP with evening administration of quinapril and was associated with a more sustained decline in ACE activity. In contrast, a study with valsartan, even though it was not in patients with hypertension, demonstrated similar levels of RAAS blockade at the end of the dosing period in patients with heart failure, irrespective of whether valsartan 320 mg was given as a single morning dose or divided into a 160 mg morning and evening dose. Because we did not observe any BP differences with regard to morning or evening administration, it can be concluded that once-daily use of valsartan at 320 mg effectively inhibits the RAAS for the full 24-h period.

### Olmesartan / amlodipine / hydrochlorothiazide in participants with hypertension and diabetes, chronic kidney disease, or chronic cardiovascular disease: a subanalysis of the multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group TRINITY study [^116axHAB]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2012). Low credibility.

Despite the evidence supporting the benefit of targeted BP control in high-risk patient groups, some investigators have raised questions regarding incremental benefit with more aggressive BP goals. The European Society of Hypertension guidelines note that many recommendations on hypertension management are based on post hoc analyses rather than prospective randomized trial data, with the latter being a preferable evidence base for BP target recommendations in different patient groups. At present, it appears reasonable to adhere to currently established guideline targets and goals of < 130/80 mm Hg in these high-risk patient groups.

Limitations to the current subgroup and post hoc analyses include that statistical analyses between the subgroups were not completed because of the unequal participant numbers in the subgroups. In addition, the TRINITY study only evaluated the highest doses of each of the 3 agents in the dual- and triple-combination regimens; therefore, it does not provide information on the efficacy and safety of the lower dosing regimens. This study also excluded individuals with illnesses such as symptomatic heart failure and therefore it cannot be determined whether the triple-combination treatment is appropriate for this patient population; caution must be exercised regarding generalizability of these data to the overall population.

Geriatric Use

Clinical studies of amlodipine did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Elderly patients have decreased clearance of amlodipine with a resulting increase of AUC of approximately 40–60%, and a lower initial dose may be required (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).

Benazeprilat is eliminated via the kidneys and the bile; renal excretion is the main route in patients with normal renal function. In the urine, benazepril accounts for less than 1% and benazeprilat for about 20% of an oral dose. Elimination of benazeprilat is biphasic with an initial half-life of about 3 hours and a terminal half-life of about 22 hours. Benazeprilat's effective elimination half-life is 10 to 11 hours, while that of amlodipine is about 2 days, so steady-state levels of the 2 components are achieved after about a week of once-daily dosing.

Excretion

Amlodipine: Elimination from the plasma is biphasic with a terminal elimination half-life of about 30 to 50 hours. Ten percent of the parent amlodipine compound and 60% of the metabolites of amlodipine are excreted in the urine.

Atorvastatin: Atorvastatin and its metabolites are eliminated primarily in bile following hepatic and/or extra-hepatic metabolism; however, the drug does not appear to undergo enterohepatic recirculation. Mean plasma elimination half-life of atorvastatin in humans is approximately 14 hours, but the half-life of inhibitory activity for HMG-CoA reductase is 20 to 30 hours because of the contribution of active metabolites. Less than 2% of a dose of atorvastatin is recovered in urine following oral administration.

Specific Populations

Geriatric

Amlodipine: Elderly patients have decreased clearance of amlodipine with a resulting increase in AUC of approximately 40 to 60%, and a lower initial dose of amlodipine may be required.

Atorvastatin: Plasma concentrations of atorvastatin are higher (approximately 40% for Cmaxand 30% for AUC) in healthy elderly subjects (age ≥ 65 years) than in young adults. Clinical data suggest a greater degree of LDL-lowering at any dose of atorvastatin in the elderly population compared to younger adults [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)].

### Personalized antihypertensive treatment optimization with smartphone-enabled remote precision dosing of amlodipine during the COVID-19 pandemic (PERSONAL-covidBP trial) [^1126xYjc]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This trial has demonstrated the ability to adjust and personalize drug dose to optimize clinical outcome from information recorded by participants in a dedicated smartphone app and transmitted securely to a clinician. Clinically significant reductions in BP were rapidly achieved from the first week using this novel titration protocol. Most participants' BPs were successfully controlled despite the cautious dosing regime based around 1 to 2 mg increments of amlodipine. Personalization of amlodipine dose improved BP control in participants, including those previously intolerant of conventional doses of amlodipine. This trial also established remote consent, enrollment, and assessment of baseline BP, based on twice‐daily measurements (in triplicate) over a 5 to 7‐day period with successful remote triaging of participants to intervention or observation based on control of hypertension. A minimum of 5 days and 24 BP measurements were required to calculate baseline BP and to determine eligibility for intervention or observation cohort. This is consistent with recently published data showing that 4.5 days of home monitoring is the minimum required for a reliable estimate of BP level.

This trial has important strengths. It was the first trial to evaluate personalized novel amlodipine dose titration for mild–moderate hypertension under a remote medical management protocol. The trial tested the efficacy and safety of precision dosing of amlodipine incorporating novel doses up to the maximum licensed dose for hypertension. The trial included remote recruitment and triage into cohorts according to BP control, including an observation cohort. A limitation of the trial was that it did not include a control for comparison to the intervention cohort. Use of a placebo control was considered unethical, and usual care as a comparator during COVID‐19 lockdowns and restrictions was unpredictable, therefore a randomized controlled design was not feasible. Participants were required to possess a smartphone, which could limit the generalizability of the population and had the potential to lead to enrollment of a more affluent, younger, and educated population. However, smartphone ownership is high across demographic and economic groups.

### Amlodipine and benazepril hydrochloride [^1142hJKX]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Usual starting dose is 2.5 mg/10 mg. (2.1)
May be used as add-on therapy for patients not adequately controlled with either a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker or an ACE inhibitor (2.2)
Patients who experience edema with amlodipine may be switched to amlodipine and benazepril hydrochloride capsules containing a lower dose of amlodipine. (2.1)

2.1 General Considerations

The recommended initial dose is amlodipine 2.5 mg and benazepril 10 mg orally once-daily.

Begin therapy with amlodipine and benazepril hydrochloride capsules only after a patient has either (a) failed to achieve the desired antihypertensive effect with amlodipine or benazepril monotherapy, or (b) demonstrated inability to achieve adequate antihypertensive effect with amlodipine therapy without developing edema.

The antihypertensive effect of amlodipine and benazepril hydrochloride capsules is largely attained within 2 weeks. If blood pressure remains uncontrolled, the dose may be titrated up to amlodipine 10 mg and benazepril 40 mg once-daily. The dosing should be individualized and adjusted according to the patient's clinical response.

In clinical trials of amlodipine and benazepril combination therapy using amlodipine doses of 2.5 to 10 mg and benazepril doses of 10 to 40 mg, the antihypertensive effects increased with increasing dose of amlodipine in all patient groups, and the effects increased with increasing dose of benazepril in nonblack groups.

Amlodipine and benazepril hydrochloride capsules may be substituted for the titrated components.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Absorption

Amlodipine reaches peak plasma concentration (Cmax) within 6.5 hours following oral administration of NORLIQVA. Absolute bioavailability of amlodipine has been estimated to be between 64 and 90%.

Effect of food

Administration with a high- fat, high-calorie meal did not have a significant effect on the Cmaxand AUC of NORLIQVA.

Distribution

Ex vivo studies have shown that approximately 93% of the circulating drug is bound to plasma proteins in hypertensive patients. Steady-state plasma levels of amlodipine are reached after 7 to 8 days of consecutive daily dosing.

Elimination

Metabolism

Amlodipine is extensively (about 90%) converted to inactive metabolites via hepatic metabolism with 10% of the parent compound and 60% of the metabolites excreted in the urine

Excretion

Elimination from the plasma is biphasic with a mean terminal elimination half-life of 52 hours.

Specific Populations

Geriatric Patients

The renal clearance of amlodipine is lower in elderly patients compared to younger adults. This results in increase in AUC of approximately 40–60% [see Dosage & Administration (2.1)].

Pediatric Patients

Sixty-two hypertensive patients aged 6 to 17 years received doses of amlodipine between 1.25 mg and 20 mg. Weight-adjusted clearance and volume of distribution were similar to values in adults.

### Randomized, controlled, parallel-group comparison of ambulatory and clinic blood pressure responses to amlodipine or enalapril during and after treatment in adult Chinese patients with hypertension [^112D2eMT]. Clinical Therapeutics (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Few studies have examined the relative efficacy and tolerability of antihypertensive drug classes in Chinese populations.

Objective

This study compared the efficacy, tolerability, and duration of antihypertensive effect of amlodipine besylate and enalapril in Chinese patients with hypertension, including elderly patients with isolated systolic hypertension.

Methods

This randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group dose-titration study was conducted at the Department of Medicine and Therapeutics, Chinese University of Hong Kong. Chinese patients aged 18 to 80 years with primary hypertension were enrolled. After a 4-week placebo run-in period, patients were randomly assigned to receive active oral, once-daily treatment with amlodipine (5 mg) or with enalapril (5 mg) for 14 weeks. Treatment doses were titrated at weeks 4 and 8 if necessary according to blood pressure (BP) response and if the dose had been tolerated. Patients also underwent 24-hour ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) at the end of the placebo run-in, after the first and last doses of active treatment, and 48 hours after discontinuation of treatment to determine the duration of drug action and to mimic the effect of 2 missed doses.

Results

Eighty patients were recruited for the study (26 men, 54 women; mean [SD] age, 60.5 [11.6] years) (40 patients per group). Thirty-seven patients in each group completed the active treatment phase. Baseline trough BPs were similar: 167.7 (15.0)/94.6 (9.7) mm Hg in the amlodipine group and 168.6 (11.9)/93.4 (9.5) mm Hg in the enalapril group. After 14 weeks of treatment, amlodipine (mean [SD] final dose, 6.3 [2.3] mg) produced greater reductions than enalapril (mean [SD] final dose, 13.3 [6.6] mg) in trough BP (-20.8 [13.2]/-9.2 [9.0] vs -5.5 [14.9]/-3.2 [10.6] mm Hg, respectively; P ≤ 0.01). Most of the effect of amlodipine persisted for 72 hours after the last dose (-18.9 [14.6]/-11.1 [11.7] mm Hg), but enalapril had no significant antihypertensive effect at 72 hours (-1.3 [12.3]/-1.8 [9.1] mm Hg). Similar observations were found with ABPM recordings. Cough was reported in 5 patients (12.5%) and 13 patients (32.5%) in the amlodipine and enalapril groups, respectively, but was thought to be treatment related in only 6 patients (15.0%), all in the enalapril group. One of the patients in the enalapril group withdrew from the study because of cough, and 1 patient in the amlodipine group withdrew because of ankle edema.

### Plasma trough concentrations of antihypertensive drugs for the assessment of treatment adherence: a meta-analysis [^115FK3qE]. Hypertension (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The present study was designed to formulate a pooled trough concentration for amlodipine, hydrochlorothiazide, and valsartan; 3 frequently prescribed antihypertensive drugs from different classes with different pharmacokinetic properties, with the aim to use these values in the quantitative biochemical assessment of medication adherence (implementation and persistence phase) in patients with uncontrolled hypertension. Our meta-analysis resulted in a pooled trough concentration of 9.3 ng/mL (95% CI, 7.6–11.0) for amlodipine, 41.0 ng/mL (95% CI, 17.4–64.7) for hydrochlorothiazide, and 352.9 ng/mL (95% CI, 243.5–462.3) for valsartan. However, substantial heterogeneity within- and between studies was present, which could only partly be explained by differences in dose in case of amlodipine and differences in mean age for hydrochlorothiazide.

2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

General Considerations:

Majority of effect attained within 2 weeks (2.1)
May be administered with other antihypertensive agents (2.1)

Hypertension:

May be used as add-on therapy for patients not controlled on monotherapy (2.2)
Patients who experience dose-limiting adverse reactions on monotherapy may be switched to amlodipine and valsartan containing a lower dose of that component (2.2)
May be substituted for titrated components (2.3)
When used as initial therapy: Initiate with 5/160 mg, then titrate upwards as necessary to a maximum of 10/320 mg once daily (2.4)

2.1 General Considerations

Dose once daily. The dosage can be increased after 1 to 2 weeks of therapy to a maximum of one 10/320 mg tablet once daily as needed to control blood pressure. The majority of the antihypertensive effect is attained within 2 weeks after initiation of therapy or a change in dose.

Amlodipine and valsartan may be administered with other antihypertensive agents.

2.2 Add-on Therapy

A patient whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled with amlodipine (or another dihydropyridine calcium-channel blocker) alone or with valsartan (or another ARB) alone may be switched to combination therapy with amlodipine and valsartan.

A patient who experiences dose-limiting adverse reactions on either component alone may be switched to amlodipine and valsartan containing a lower dose of that component in combination with the other to achieve similar blood pressure reductions. The clinical response to amlodipine and valsartan should be subsequently evaluated and if blood pressure remains uncontrolled after 3 to 4 weeks of therapy, the dose may be titrated up to a maximum of 10/320 mg.

2.3 Replacement Therapy

For convenience, patients receiving amlodipine and valsartan from separate tablets may instead wish to receive tablets of amlodipine and valsartan containing the same component doses.

2.4 Initial Therapy

A patient may be initiated on amlodipine and valsartan if it is unlikely that control of blood pressure would be achieved with a single agent. The usual starting dose is amlodipine and valsartan 5/160 mg once daily in patients who are not volume-depleted.

Pregnancy hypertension — common oral antihypertensive agents and dosing: Labetalol is dosed 200–2400 mg/d orally in 2 to 3 divided doses and is commonly initiated at 100–200 mg twice daily; it has potential bronchoconstrictive effects and should be avoided in women with asthma, preexisting myocardial disease, decompensated cardiac function, and heart block and bradycardia. Nifedipine (extended release) is dosed 30–120 mg/d orally of an extended- release preparation and commonly initiated at 30–60 mg once daily (extended release); do not use sublingual form, and immediate-release formulation should generally be reserved for control of severe, acutely elevated blood pressures in hospitalized patients and should be avoided in tachycardia. Methyldopa is dosed 500–3000 mg/d orally in 2 to 4 divided doses and is commonly initiated at 250 mg 2 or 3 times daily; safety data extend up to 7 y of age in offspring, though it may not be as effective as other medications — especially in control of severe hypertension — and use is limited by side effects (sedation, depression, dizziness). Hydrochlorothiazide 12.5–50 mg daily is considered a second- or third-line agent.

### Amlodipine besylate and valsartan (Amlodipine and valsartan) [^115L5wnA]. FDA (2018). Low credibility.

Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal.

Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy. Amlodipine and valsartan tablets are indicated for the treatment of hypertension.

Amlodipine and valsartan tablets may be used in patients whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled on either monotherapy.

Amlodipine and valsartan tablets may also be used as initial therapy in patients who are likely to need multiple drugs to achieve their blood pressure goals.

The choice of amlodipine and valsartan tablets as initial therapy for hypertension should be based on an assessment of potential benefits and risks including whether the patient is likely to tolerate the lowest dose of amlodipine and valsartan tablets.

### Telmisartan and amlodipine [^1132U7QU]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

Amlodipine

Peak plasma concentrations of amlodipine are reached 6 to 12 hours after administration of amlodipine alone. Absolute bioavailability has been estimated to be between 64% and 90%. The bioavailability of amlodipine is not altered by the presence of food.

Elimination of amlodipine from the plasma is biphasic with a terminal elimination half-life of about 30 to 50 hours. Steady state plasma levels of amlodipine are reached after 7 to 8 days of consecutive daily dosing.

Distribution

Telmisartan:

Telmisartan is highly bound to plasma proteins (> 99.5%), mainly albumin and α1- acid glycoprotein. Plasma protein binding is constant over the concentration range achieved with recommended doses. The volume of distribution for telmisartan is approximately 500 liters indicating additional tissue binding.

Amlodipine:

The apparent volume of distribution of amlodipine is 21 L/kg. Approximately 93% of circulating amlodipine is bound to plasma proteins in hypertensive patients.

Metabolism and Elimination

Telmisartan:

Following either intravenous or oral administration of14C-labeled telmisartan, most of the administered dose (> 97%) was eliminated unchanged in feces via biliary excretion; only minute amounts were found in the urine (0.91% and 0.49% of total radioactivity, respectively).

### The phase III, double-blind, parallel-group controlled study of amlodipine 10 mg once daily in Japanese patients with essential hypertension who insufficiently responded to amlodipine 5 mg once daily [^111Rw2UU]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2009). Low credibility.

The objective of this Phase III double-blind parallel-group controlled study was to examine the superiority of amlodipine 10 mg once daily (the amlodipine 10 mg group) to amlodipine 5 mg once daily (the amlodipine 5 mg group) in 305 Japanese outpatients with essential hypertension whose systolic blood pressure (SBP) had not reached the therapeutic target levels (< 130–140/80–90 mm Hg) when treated with amlodipine 5 mg once daily. This study consisted of the 1-week prescreening, 8-week screening and 8-week double-blind periods. Changes in trough SBP from baseline at week 8 of the double-blind period (week 8) were -7.0 mm Hg and -13.7 mm Hg in the amlodipine 5 and 10 mg groups, respectively; a significant difference (P < 0.001) was found between the two groups. Changes in trough diastolic blood pressure (DBP) from baseline at week 8 were -2.7 mm Hg and -6.8 mm Hg in the amlodipine 5 and 10 mg groups, respectively, with a significant difference (P < 0.001) between the two groups. At week 8, responder rates were 28.5 and 44.0% in the amlodipine 5 mg and 10 mg groups, respectively, with a significant difference (P = 0.002) between the two groups. The amlodipine 10 mg group showed no significant difference in the incidences of adverse events against the amlodipine 5 mg group. The incidence of mild peripheral oedema was 4% only in the amlodipine 10 mg group. In conclusion, amlodipine 10 mg once daily was found to be superior to amlodipine 5 mg once daily, safe, well tolerated and useful for the relevant subjects.

CADUET

Dosage of CADUET must be individualized on the basis of both effectiveness and tolerance for each individual component in the treatment of hypertension/angina and hyperlipidemia. Select doses of amlodipine and atorvastatin independently.

CADUET may be substituted for its individually titrated components. Patients may be given the equivalent dose of CADUET or a dose of CADUET with increased amounts of amlodipine, atorvastatin, or both for additional antianginal effects, blood pressure lowering, or lipid-lowering effect.

CADUET may be used to provide additional therapy for patients already on one of its components. CADUET may be used to initiate treatment in patients with hyperlipidemia and either hypertension or angina.

Important Dosage Information

Take CADUET orally once daily at any time of the day, with or without food.

Amlodipine

The usual initial antihypertensive oral dosage of amlodipine is 5 mg once daily, and the maximum dose is 10 mg once daily.

Pediatric (age > 6 years), small adult, fragile, or elderly patients, or patients with hepatic insufficiency may be started on 2.5 mg once daily and this dose may be used when adding amlodipine to other antihypertensive therapy.

Adjust dosage according to blood pressure goals. In general, wait 7 to 14 days between titration steps. Titration may proceed more rapidly, however, if clinically warranted, provided the patient is assessed frequently.

Angina The recommended dosage of amlodipine for chronic stable or vasospastic angina is 5–10 mg, with the lower dose suggested in the elderly and in patients with hepatic insufficiency. Most patients will require 10 mg for adequate effect.

Coronary Artery Disease The recommended dosage range of amlodipine for patients with CAD is 5–10 mg once daily. In clinical studies, the majority of patients required 10 mg [see Clinical Studies (14.4)].

Pediatrics The effective antihypertensive oral dose of amlodipine in pediatric patients ages 6–17 years is 2.5 mg to 5 mg once daily. Doses in excess of 5 mg daily have not been studied in pediatric patients [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Clinical Studies (14.1)].

### Starting antihypertensive drug treatment with combination therapy: controversies in hypertension-con side of the argument [^117HK15G]. Hypertension (2021). Medium credibility.

Rational Use of SPCs

We proposed that starting antihypertensive therapy in treatment-naive hypertensive patients might be based on a few simple principles. First, use antihypertensive drugs with different modes of action in line with the AB/CD algorithm (Figure 3). Second, use antihypertensive agents with a long duration of action based on their molecular structure, so-called forgiving drugs, rather than extended-release dosage formulations. Third, titrate each drug to the highest dose that does not produce adverse effects. Fourth, include a thiazide in the drug combination. Finally, once the right combination has been found by rotating through and combining drug classes as well as the timing of dosing, stimulate adherence by reducing the pill load by prescribing SPCs including 2 or 3 antihypertensive agents in adjustable doses. Initiating antihypertensive drug treatment with SDs overcomes the inflexibility of SPCs in titrating the doses of the SD components and the timing of their administration, for instance to prevent nocturnal diuresis or hypotension. In line with the above proposal, in Japan, only one triple-drug SPC is being marketed (telmisartan/amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide 80/5/12.5 mg). It can only be prescribed after 8 weeks of successful treatment with its components given as dual SPCs plus one SD or as free 3-drug SD combinations

None of the trials of SPCs had a cardiovascular end point. In line with the 2019 National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guideline, an important research issue is to mount outcome-driven randomized clinical trials to delineate particular subgroups of hypertensive patients who might benefit from starting dual therapy. Furthermore, compared with hydrochlorothiazide, chlorthalidone is 1.5 to 2.0 × more potent, has a substantially longer duration of action (plasma half-life, 8 versus > 24 hours), and is not metabolized but excreted unchanged in urine, thereby preventing drug-drug interactions. Unfortunately, the diuretic in SPCs currently marketed is overwhelmingly hydrochlorothiazide, an issue to be addressed by manufacturers (Table 2). Finally, payers should better inform physicians and patients on the costs of antihypertensive drugs to reduce health care costs, decrease out-of-pocket costs as a factor limiting adherence, and to support the sustainability of health care by lower drug costs and better prevention of the cardiovascular-renal hypertension-associated complications.
