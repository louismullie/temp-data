## Question

Gastritis with ppi

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the role of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) in gastritis, including when they are indicated, how to dose and monitor, what the risks are, and when to stop or avoid them. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the etiologies of gastritis and how that drives therapy. Then, I should verify the role of PPIs in H. pylori–positive gastritis, including eradication regimens and the special case of corpus atrophic gastritis. Next, I will examine PPI use in H. pylori–negative gastritis, including NSAID-associated disease and functional dyspepsia. After that, I need to check dosing, duration, and deprescribing strategies, including rebound considerations. Finally, I will review safety signals, monitoring, and synthesize a practical decision framework with clear indications and exceptions.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame: gastritis is not a single entity, and management hinges on etiology, severity, and risk of complications. The major categories are H. pylori–associated gastritis, NSAID/aspirin-induced gastropathy, and functional dyspepsia with histologic gastritis, with autoimmune and other causes less common; importantly, H. pylori eradication is the disease-modifying therapy for H. pylori gastritis, whereas PPIs primarily provide symptomatic relief and mucosal healing rather than cure the underlying cause [^112YRPmf] [^111WLsUd].

> I will now examine H. pylori–positive gastritis, because this is where confusion often arises. Wait, let me verify the role of PPIs here: PPIs are not used as monotherapy for H. pylori gastritis. Instead, they are a key component of eradication regimens to enhance antibiotic efficacy via acid suppression, and eradication is the definitive therapy that reduces ulcer risk and may lower gastric cancer risk, especially when treated before atrophy develops [^116TvhuT] [^115YAUbr] [^111WLsUd].

> Hold on, I should verify the special case of corpus atrophic gastritis. In this setting, acid secretion is already impaired, so adding a PPI may be unnecessary and could theoretically worsen mucosal changes; emerging real-world data suggest that bismuth-based regimens without PPIs can still achieve high eradication rates, though this remains observational and should be individualized. I need to ensure we don't overgeneralize, but avoiding routine PPIs in corpus atrophy is reasonable when acid suppression is not otherwise indicated [^1111RMY3] [^111hr79z] [^111qMbUy].

> Next, I should review H. pylori–negative gastritis, particularly NSAID/aspirin-associated disease. PPIs are effective for healing and for preventing NSAID-induced ulcers and complications in high-risk patients; guidelines support PPI co-therapy in those with GI risk factors who require ongoing NSAID or antiplatelet therapy, and this is a clear indication for PPI use beyond simple symptom control [^117T6ige] [^1144mfWD].

> Let me consider functional dyspepsia, where histologic gastritis may be present but is not the driver of symptoms. I should double-check the magnitude of benefit: PPIs provide a modest symptomatic benefit versus placebo with an NNT around 10–13, and guidelines endorse a short therapeutic trial in H. pylori–negative patients or those who remain symptomatic after eradication; however, there is no dose–response, so escalation is not helpful, and long-term PPIs are not indicated for FD alone [^112ctZ1k] [^1165fiN9] [^113x293H].

> I need to ensure dosing and administration are correct. PPIs should be taken 30–60 minutes before a meal to maximize acid suppression; potency varies by agent, and switching within the class can help if response is suboptimal, though repeated switches are not well supported. For GERD phenotypes with overlapping dyspepsia, twice-daily dosing may be reasonable short term, but step-down to the lowest effective dose is advised when feasible [^113WZvd9] [^116aC2y6].

> Now, duration and deprescribing: I should confirm that "long-term" is variably defined across studies, but clinically, use beyond 4–8 weeks for dyspepsia or GERD without ongoing indication warrants reassessment. Guidelines recommend periodic attempts to stop or step down, ideally every 6–12 months, and to manage rebound symptoms if they occur; tapering and on-demand strategies can facilitate discontinuation when appropriate [^1166HAib] [^116wRfmw] [^114STQkr].

> But wait, what about safety signals? I should review the highest-quality data. Large randomized trials show no significant increase in most adverse outcomes with pantoprazole over 3 years except for a modest increase in enteric infections, and observational associations with fractures, kidney disease, dementia, and cardiovascular events are likely confounded; nonetheless, minimizing exposure in patients without clear indications remains prudent, and routine screening for H. pylori in GERD patients solely due to PPI use is not recommended by ACG, though some position papers advise H. pylori test-and-treat in those requiring long-term PPIs to mitigate atrophy risk [^116xEDfX] [^114yiYrC] [^115p6Zif].

> I should double-check special populations and monitoring. In older adults on long-term PPIs, it is reasonable to consider bone health and magnesium assessment if symptomatic, and to reassess the indication regularly; in patients with complicated GERD, Barrett's esophagus, or severe erosive disease, discontinuation is generally not advised, whereas in those without definitive indications, deprescribing should be attempted [^113iC533] [^111niNyf] [^116mRu8j].

> Let me synthesize a practical decision framework. Use PPIs when there is a clear indication such as NSAID/aspirin gastropathy with GI risk, H. pylori eradication regimens, peptic ulcer disease, or complicated GERD; consider a short therapeutic trial in H. pylori–negative functional dyspepsia; avoid routine PPIs in corpus atrophic gastritis unless there is another indication; and always plan for the lowest effective dose and shortest duration with scheduled reassessment and deprescribing when feasible [^1144mfWD] [^112ctZ1k] [^1111RMY3] [^116wRfmw].

> In summary, I need to ensure the key message is explicit: PPIs are not a treatment for H. pylori gastritis itself. They are tools for symptom control, mucosal healing, and antibiotic potentiation within eradication therapy, and their use should be indication-driven, time-limited when possible, and regularly re-evaluated to balance benefits and potential risks [^116TvhuT] [^116wRfmw] [^116xEDfX].

PPIs are **first-line therapy** for gastritis when acid suppression is needed, especially for H. pylori–negative gastritis, NSAID-related gastritis, or functional dyspepsia [^112ctZ1k] [^117T6ige] [^1165fiN9]. They relieve symptoms and promote mucosal healing, but **do not treat the underlying cause**; H. pylori must be eradicated when present [^111WLsUd] [^115YAUbr]. PPIs are generally safe short term, but long-term use carries risks (enteric infections, micronutrient deficits, fundic gland polyps) [^116xEDfX] [^115NAEHa]; therefore, use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration, reassess at 6–12 months, and deprescribe if no ongoing indication [^116wRfmw] [^116mRu8j]. In corpus atrophic gastritis, PPIs may be unnecessary or harmful; consider non-PPI regimens for H. pylori eradication [^1111RMY3] [^111hr79z].

---

## Indications for PPI therapy in gastritis

PPIs are indicated in gastritis when **acid suppression** is needed to relieve symptoms and promote healing:

- **H. pylori-negative gastritis**: Empiric PPI therapy is recommended for patients with dyspepsia who are H. pylori-negative or remain symptomatic after eradication [^112ctZ1k] [^113x293H].

- **NSAID-induced gastritis**: PPIs are effective for healing and preventing NSAID-related ulcers and complications [^117T6ige] [^1144mfWD].

- **Functional dyspepsia**: PPIs provide modest symptom relief in a subset of patients [^1165fiN9] [^112ctZ1k].

- **Peptic ulcer disease**: PPIs are essential for ulcer healing and prevention of recurrence [^1144mfWD] [^117YXL34].

---

## Efficacy of PPIs in gastritis

PPIs **effectively suppress gastric acid**, relieving symptoms and promoting mucosal healing. In functional dyspepsia, PPIs reduce persistent symptoms versus placebo (RR 0.87; NNT 10) [^112ctZ1k] [^1165fiN9]. In NSAID-related gastropathy, PPIs reduce ulcer recurrence and complications [^117T6ige] [^1144mfWD].

---

## Safety profile and adverse effects

PPIs are generally well tolerated, but **long-term use** is associated with:

- **Enteric infections**: Modest increase in C. difficile and other enteric infections [^116xEDfX] [^113iC533].

- **Micronutrient deficiencies**: Risk of vitamin B12, magnesium, and calcium deficiencies [^113hh6JM] [^113iC533].

- **Fundic gland polyps**: Increased risk with prolonged use, especially in H. pylori–negative patients [^115NAEHa].

- **Rebound acid hypersecretion**: Can occur after discontinuation, complicating withdrawal [^114STQkr] [^116QQsYa].

---

## Risks associated with long-term PPI use

Long-term PPI therapy carries potential risks, including:

| **Risk category** | **Specific risks** |
|-|-|
| Infectious | - Enteric infections (C. difficile, pneumonia) [^116xEDfX] [^113iC533] |
| Nutritional | - Vitamin B12 deficiency <br/> - Magnesium deficiency <br/> - Calcium malabsorption [^113hh6JM] [^113iC533] |
| Structural | - Fundic gland polyps <br/> - Possible progression of atrophic gastritis in H. pylori–positive patients [^115NAEHa] [^114xztur] |
| Functional | - Rebound acid hypersecretion [^114STQkr] [^116QQsYa] |

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Guidelines emphasize **judicious PPI use**:

- **Lowest effective dose**: Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration [^116wRfmw] [^116A4fiT].

- **Regular reassessment**: Reassess need at 6–12 month intervals [^116wRfmw] [^116mRu8j].

- **Deprescribing**: Attempt deprescribing in patients without ongoing indications [^116mRu8j] [^117AFx4X].

- **H. pylori testing**: Test and eradicate H. pylori in patients requiring long-term PPIs to reduce atrophy risk [^115p6Zif] [^111WLsUd].

---

## Special considerations

- **Corpus atrophic gastritis**: PPIs may be unnecessary or harmful; consider non-PPI regimens for H. pylori eradication [^1111RMY3] [^111hr79z].

- **Rebound acid hypersecretion**: Taper PPIs gradually to minimize rebound symptoms [^114STQkr] [^116QQsYa].

- **Drug interactions**: PPIs can interact with clopidogrel, diazepam, and others; monitor closely [^116CmbRZ].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Indications**: Use PPIs for H. pylori-negative gastritis, NSAID-related gastritis, functional dyspepsia, and peptic ulcer disease [^112ctZ1k] [^117T6ige] [^1165fiN9].

- **Duration**: Use short-term therapy (4–8 weeks); reassess at 6–12 months [^116wRfmw] [^116mRu8j].

- **Safety**: Monitor for enteric infections, micronutrient deficiencies, and fundic gland polyps with long-term use [^116xEDfX] [^113hh6JM] [^115NAEHa].

- **Deprescribing**: Attempt deprescribing in patients without ongoing indications [^116mRu8j] [^117AFx4X].

---

PPIs are effective for symptom control and mucosal healing in gastritis, but **do not treat the cause**; use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration, reassess regularly, and deprescribe when possible.

Conclusions

Overall, PPIs are irreplaceable drugs in the management of acid-related diseases. However, PPI treatment – as any kind of drug therapy – is not without risk of adverse effects. The overall benefits of therapy and improvement in quality of life significantly outweigh potential risks in most patients, but those without clear clinical indication are only exposed to the risks of PPI prescription. Adhering to evidence-based guidelines represents the only rational approach to an effective and safe PPI therapy.

### Proton pump inhibitors for gastroduodenal damage related to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or aspirin: twelve important questions for clinical practice [^117T6ige]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2009). Low credibility.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and aspirin are among the most commonly used medications worldwide. Their use is associated with significant gastroduodenal adverse effects, including dyspepsia, bleeding, ulcer formation, and perforation. Given their long-term use by millions of patients, there is a substantial impact at the population level of these complications. In this evidence-based review, we have endeavored to answer 12 commonly encountered questions in clinical practice that deal with the following: extent of the problem of NSAID/aspirin-induced gastroduodenal damage and its impact on public health; role of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) in the primary prevention, healing, and secondary prevention of NSAID/aspirin-induced gastroduodenal ulceration as assessed by using endoscopic end points; role of PPIs in the prevention of adverse clinical outcomes related to NSAID/aspirin use; whether PPIs are effective in NSAID-induced dyspepsia; comparison of PPI co-therapy with selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors for risk reduction of adverse clinical outcomes; role of PPIs in preventing rebleeding from aspirin ± clopidogrel therapy in high-risk patients; identifying high-risk patients who can benefit from PPI co-therapy; the role of other gastroprotective agents for prevention of NSAID/aspirin-induced gastroduodenal damage; and the cost-effectiveness of and limitations to the use of PPIs for prevention of gastroduodenal damage related to the use of NSAIDs or aspirin. We then summarized our recommendations on the use of PPIs for the clinical management of patients using NSAIDs or aspirin.

### Proton-pump inhibitors: understanding the complications and risks [^115NAEHa]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2017). Medium credibility.

Proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) are the most effective therapy for the full spectrum of gastric-acid-related diseases. However, in the past decade, a steadily increasing list of complications following long-term use of PPIs has been reported. Their potent acid-suppressive action induces several structural and functional changes within the gastric mucosa, including fundic gland polyps, enterochromaffin-like cell hyperplasia and hypergastrinaemia, which can be exaggerated in the presence of Helicobacter pylori infection. As discussed in this Review, most associations of PPIs with severe adverse events are not based on sufficient evidence because of confounding factors and a lack of plausible mechanisms. Thus, a causal relationship remains unproven in most associations, and further studies are needed. Awareness of PPI-associated risks should not lead to anxiety in patients but rather should induce the physician to consider the appropriate dosing and duration of PPI therapy, including long-term monitoring strategies in selected groups of patients because of their individual comorbidities and risk factors.

### Effective and safe proton pump inhibitor therapy in acid-related diseases – A position paper addressing benefits and potential harms of acid suppression [^114xaiMz]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The introduction of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) into clinical practice has revolutionized the management of acid-related diseases. Studies in primary care and emergency settings suggest that PPIs are frequently prescribed for inappropriate indications or for indications where their use offers little benefit. Inappropriate PPI use is a matter of great concern, especially in the elderly, who are often affected by multiple comorbidities and are taking multiple medications, and are thus at an increased risk of long-term PPI-related adverse outcomes as well as drug-to-drug interactions. Herein, we aim to review the current literature on PPI use and develop a position paper addressing the benefits and potential harms of acid suppression with the purpose of providing evidence-based guidelines on the appropriate use of these medications.

Methods

The topics, identified by a Scientific Committee, were assigned to experts selected by three Italian Scientific Societies, who independently performed a systematic search of the relevant literature using Medline/PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane databases. Search outputs were distilled, paying more attention to systematic reviews and meta-analyses (where available) representing the best evidence. The draft prepared on each topic was circulated amongst all the members of the Scientific Committee. Each expert then provided her/his input to the writing, suggesting changes and the inclusion of new material and/or additional relevant references. The global recommendations were then thoroughly discussed in a specific meeting, refined with regard to both content and wording, and approved to obtain a summary of current evidence.

Results

Twenty-five years after their introduction into clinical practice, PPIs remain the mainstay of the treatment of acid-related diseases, where their use in gastroesophageal reflux disease, eosinophilic esophagitis, Helicobacter pylori infection, peptic ulcer disease and bleeding as well as, and Zollinger–Ellison syndrome is appropriate. Prevention of gastroduodenal mucosal lesions (and symptoms) in patients taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or antiplatelet therapies and carrying gastrointestinal risk factors also represents an appropriate indication. On the contrary, steroid use does not need any gastroprotection, unless combined with NSAID therapy. In dyspeptic patients with persisting symptoms, despite successful H. pylori eradication, short-term PPI treatment could be attempted. Finally, addition of PPIs to pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy in patients with refractory steatorrhea may be worthwhile.

Conclusions

Overall, PPIs are irreplaceable drugs in the management of acid-related diseases. However, PPI treatment, as any kind of drug therapy, is not without risk of adverse effects. The overall benefits of therapy and improvement in quality of life significantly outweigh potential harms in most patients, but those without clear clinical indication are only exposed to the risks of PPI prescription. Adhering with evidence-based guidelines represents the only rational approach to effective and safe PPI therapy.

### Effective and safe proton pump inhibitor therapy in acid-related diseases – A position paper addressing benefits and potential harms of acid suppression [^116TvhuT]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Summary of the current evidence

PPIs represent a key component of any currently adopted regimens for H. pylori eradication. The degree and duration of acid suppression influence the eradication rate. While almost all H. pylori- positive ulcers are cured by H. pylori eradication, H. pylori- negative and NSAID/aspirin-negative PUs need high dose PPIs to be healed and, often, lifelong acid suppression is required to prevent recurrence.

After the discovery by Warren and Marshall of the infectious etiology of PU disease in 1984, several lines of evidence confirmed that H. pylori eradication cures PU disease without the need for subsequent long-term maintenance antisecretory therapy, and can also be beneficial to other H. pylori -related diseases. While previously used only to heal PUs, PPIs have become a key component of all the currently adopted eradication regimens, thus gaining a new role in the management of PU disease.

H. pylori is located within the gastric mucus layer, deep within the mucus-secreting glands of the antrum, attached to cells and even within cells, and is able to survive over a wide pH spectrum. Since the survival capabilities of H. pylori within the stomach make its eradication difficult, several different drug combinations have been developed, with variable and inconsistent success, with no single therapy being effective worldwide. Therefore, the search for a new regimen to treat H. pylori infection still continues today.

An effective therapy should be able to eradicate the organism from each of these potential niches, which is an overwhelming task for any single antibiotic, whose in vitro susceptibility does not necessarily correlate with successful treatment in vivo. Since the very beginning, it was recognized that therapy with a single antibiotic leads to poor cure rates and various recipes were attempted, resulting in several effective combinations of antimicrobials, bismuth, and antisecretory drugs.

### Medical management of acid-peptic disorders of the stomach [^111JQe6p]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

In the past 30 years, medicine has witnessed an unprecedented evolution in acid-peptic disorder management, fueled by major advances in our understanding of the physiology of acid secretion and the gastric mucosal barrier. The other pivotal development in understanding these disorders has been the recognition of Helicobacter pylori's role in the pathophysiology of peptic ulcer disease, chronic gastritis, and even gastric malignancy. This evolution continues as H pylori wanes in significance, and medicine is challenged by treating iatrogenic conditions brought on by ulcerogenic anti-inflammatory drugs. Following a description of the relevant physiology and biochemistry of gastric acid secretion and the gastric mucosal barrier, this article describes the current medicinal arsenal available to treat acid-peptic disorders of the stomach.

### Long-term safety concerns with proton pump inhibitors [^113hh6JM]. The American Journal of Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are among the most widely prescribed medications worldwide. Their use has resulted in dramatic improvements in treatment of peptic ulcer disease and gastroesophageal reflux disease. Despite an acceptable safety profile, mounting data demonstrate concerns about the long-term use of PPIs. To provide a comprehensive review regarding the concerns of long-term PPI use, a literature search was performed to identify pertinent original and review articles. Despite study shortcomings, the collective body of information overwhelmingly suggests an increased risk of infectious complications and nutritional deficiencies. Data regarding any increased risk in gastric or colon malignancy are less convincing. PPIs have revolutionized the management and complications of acid-related disorders with a high margin of safety; however, with the data available, efforts to reduce the dosing of or discontinue the use of PPIs must be reassessed frequently.

### When is proton pump inhibitor use appropriate? [^11733SbJ]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy is commonly used outside of Food and Drug Administration indication for a broad range of conditions such as extra-esophageal reflux and PPI-responsive esophageal eosinophilia. While this may be appropriate in some scenarios, it has also resulted in widespread inappropriate PPI use. At the same time, data suggesting adverse effects of long-term PPI therapy are multiplying, albeit mainly from low quality studies. The systematic review by Scarpignato et al. (BMC Med 14:179, 2016) addresses this dilemma with a comprehensive analysis of the risks and benefits of PPI use. The authors concluded that, while PPIs are highly efficacious in erosive acid-peptic disorders, efficacy is not equaled in other conditions. In some instances, they found no supportive evidence of benefit. With respect to side effects, they indicated that the questionable harms associated with PPI therapy do not outweigh the benefits afforded by appropriate PPI use. However, inappropriate PPI use results in increased healthcare costs and unnecessary exposure to potential adverse effects. Ideally, PPI therapy should be personalized, based on indication, effectiveness, patient preference, and risk assessment.

### Proton pump inhibitors: the good, bad, and ugly [^112gFx5y]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) continue to be the medication of choice for treatment of acid-related disease, with few if any overt side effects seen with daily use. They are often prescribed empirically, often in high doses and with many patients being treated with multiple PPIs without an objective diagnosis. Therefore, they are believed to be overprescribed and used without indication. In this article we discuss the appropriate clinical indications for PPIs, review in detail the major associated adverse events, and put in perspective key issues in balancing benefits and risk of this exceptional (and safe) class of drug.

ACG/CAG dyspepsia guideline — Statement 4: WE RECOMMEND DYSPEPSIA PATIENTS UNDER THE AGE OF 60 SHOULD HAVE EMPIRICAL PPI THERAPY IF THEY ARE H. PYLORI-NEGATIVE OR WHO REMAIN SYMPTOMATIC AFTER H. PYLORI ERADICATION THERAPY (strong recommendation, high quality evidence). Across six RCTs (n = 2,709), proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy reduced persistent symptoms versus placebo or antacid (50% vs. 73%; RR remaining dyspeptic on PPI = 0.75; 95% CI = 0.64–0.88; NNT = 6, 95% CI = 4–11). Seven RCTs (n = 2,456) comparing PPI to H2-receptor antagonist (H2RA) found no significant difference (RR = 0.93; 95% CI = 0.76–1.16; I² = 91%).

### Effective and safe proton pump inhibitor therapy in acid-related diseases – A position paper addressing benefits and potential harms of acid suppression [^113xcsf1]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Despite PPIs carrying – like any other classes of drugs – some risks, they should not be denied to patients who are likely to benefit from them merely because of concerns about putative adverse effects. There is generally some equivalence between the acceptable burden of adverse effects and the severity of the illness being treated. However, patients with acid-related diseases are often otherwise "healthy" subjects, who take drugs for a given condition. What level of undesirable effects would be acceptable for them and who will bear the cost of treating any ensuing iatrogenic disease? A number of simple and potentially effective preventive measures should be recommended for some (if not all) safety concerns in order to minimize them.

First of all, PPI therapy should be evidence based. Decisions on whether or not to initiate or continue PPI therapy should be sound and PPIs should only be prescribed when there is an appropriate clinical indication. Clinical guidelines can certainly help. In this Position Paper, we have reviewed the current available guidelines, together with the systematic reviews and meta-analyses used to generate them, and synthesized the knowledge in a number of statements (i.e. Summaries of the current evidence) and in Table 3.

Table 3
Current indications of proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy

Guidelines rely on both evidence and expert opinion; they are neither infallible nor a substitute for clinical judgment. They do, however, go beyond systematic reviews to recommend what should and should not be done in specific clinical circumstances. Despite guidelines being developed to improve quality of care received by patients, they have been criticized for recommending too little or too much, and even for providing reasons for national health systems or insurance payers to deny coverage. Guidelines are often inflexible and can actually harm by leaving insufficient room for clinicians to tailor care to individual patient circumstances and medical history. What is best for patients overall, as recommended by guidelines, may be inappropriate for individuals. Only evidence-based recommendations, which consider the balance between benefits and harms, and weigh these considerations using patient (rather than expert and societal) value, should be followed in everyday clinical practice. Taking these considerations into account, we have tried to distill the current evidence and provide physicians with clear patient-oriented recommendations, beyond cost and reimbursement issues. Medicine is a rapidly evolving field, however, and the validity of guidelines will not necessarily stand the test of time: indeed, today's assumptions may no longer be valid tomorrow. Healthcare providers should therefore stay tuned and constantly update their knowledge.

### AGA clinical practice update on the diagnosis and management of atrophic gastritis: expert review [^111WLsUd]. Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Atrophic gastritis (AG) H pylori management — Irrespective of etiology, patients with AG should be tested for H pylori and, if positive, treated with confirmation of successful eradication; despite eradication, risk can remain elevated in extensive or moderate to severe atrophy (eg, OLGA/OLGIM III/IV), yet H pylori eradication does still appear to reduce the risk of gastric cancer.

### Management of Helicobacter pylori-related disorders [^117R8hfY]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2012). Low credibility.

The discovery of Helicobacter pylori has opened new opportunities in the management of gastrointestinal disorders, with the cure of chronic ulcer disease now being possible for the first time. The 1994 United States National Institutes of Health Consensus Conference recommended that patients with duodenal or gastric ulcers unrelated to the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) should be given eradication therapy. These guidelines were refined at a conference held recently in Maastricht. The updated guidelines strongly recommend treatment in patients with duodenal or gastric ulcer disease, low-grade mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) gastric lymphoma, gastritis with severe macro-or microscopic changes and after resection of early gastric cancer. Despite a lack of hard scientific evidence, the guidelines also suggest that eradication treatment is advisable in patients with unequivocally diagnosed functional dyspepsia, a family history of gastric cancer, long-term treatment with proton-pump inhibitors for gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD), planned or existing NSAID treatment, after gastric surgery for ulcer or cancer, or if the patient wants to be treated. Many different therapeutic regimens have been used previously, but at present the best treatment is proton-pump inhibitor-based triple therapy, comprising a proton-pump inhibitor plus two drugs out of clarithromycin, a nitroimidazole and amoxycillin. One-week low-dose triple therapy cures 85–95% of infected patients.

### Proton pump inhibitors and gastric neoplasia [^111fnuCW]. Gut (2006). Low credibility.

Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are very effective in maintaining symptomatic and endoscopic remission of acid peptic disorders, such as gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. Side effects with respect to function and morphology of the gastric mucosa are common. Helicobacter pylori eradication can partially prevent and reverse these effects without impairing PPI therapy for gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. This makes long term PPI treatment a safe therapy for patients with acid peptic disorders. The potential side effects of such therapy are discussed here.

### Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: overall risks and management. complementary roles for COX-2 inhibitors and proton pump inhibitors [^112EHFVw]. Gut (2003). Low credibility.

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are well recognised as causing peptic ulceration and ulcer complications. However, several critical issues, including the amount of both gastrointestinal and non-gastrointestinal disease affected by NSAIDs, their interaction with ancillary risk factors, and how to optimise management in subgroups, remain poorly understood. In this article, strategies for subgroups that take account of non-specific gastrointestinal risks, minimisation of residual risk, and the importance of non-gastrointestinal toxicity are suggested, and areas for research identified.

### Therapeutic regimens againstinfection without proton pump inhibitors in patients with corpus atrophic gastritis: a real-life single-centre longitudinal observational study [^111qMbUy]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

H. pylori treatment regimens have been tested in clinical trials including mainly patients with superficial non-atrophic gastritis and, up to now, no data are available on the treatment efficacy of the commonly used eradication treatment regimens without using a concomitant PPI treatment. The current real-life longitudinal observational study showed that modified ABT and SPBT eradication regimens without associating PPIs are well tolerated and able to achieve successful cure of infection in about 90% of patients with corpus atrophic gastritis. Importantly, the eradication rates of the modified treatment regimens without PPIs observed in patients with corpus atrophic gastritis were not inferior to the commonly used treatment regimens with PPIs in patients with H. pylori- positive superficial non-atrophic gastritis. Hence, eradication regimens against H. pylori infection in corpus atrophic gastritis avoiding the prescription of PPIs are feasible and efficacious, exceeding the 'borderline acceptable' eradication rates in clinical practice being between 85% and 89%.

PPIs are considered essential in the eradication treatment of H. pylori, enhancing the antibiotics' bioavailability and effectiveness, and this benefit related to the increased intragastric pH is considered even higher with double than with single doses daily with classic amoxicillin- and clarithromycin- or metronidazole-based triple therapies; conversely, this 'supporter' role of PPIs is not well settled in quadruple treatments. – A recent study based on the 'European Registry on Helicobacter pylori management' (Hp-EuReg)evaluated the role of dosage of PPIs in the effectiveness of H. pylori eradication treatments and concluded that one of the variables most strongly influencing the H. pylori treatment effectiveness were the prescribed PPIs dose; however, according to their data, the use of high-dose PPIs in 14-day triple therapy and 10-or 14-day quadruple concomitant therapy can be recommended, while standard-dose PPIs seem to be sufficient in 10-day bismuth quadruple therapies, showing a less strong role of PPIs in this latter regimen.

The Maastricht 2 Consensus Report features evidence-based recommendations for the management of Helicobacter pylori infection. Strongly recommended indications for H. pylori eradication include duodenal and gastric ulcer, mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma, atrophic gastritis, post gastric cancer resection, first-degree relation to gastric cancer patients, and patient's wishes. Advisable indications include functional dyspepsia, with the statement that eradication can lead to long-term improvement of symptoms in a subset of patients. Because H. pylori eradication does not cause gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) in most patients, or exacerbate existing GORD, H. pylori should be eradicated in patients requiring long-term acid suppression. Also advisable is H. pylori eradication before administration of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), although this alone may be insufficient to reduce recurrent bleeding or enhance ulcer healing in patients receiving antisecretory therapy who continue to take NSAIDs. Maastricht 2 also introduced the concept of the 'treatment package' that considers first- and second-line eradication therapies together. A 'search and treat' strategy should be considered in patients with peptic ulcers; for patients with uncomplicated duodenal ulcer, administration of proton pump inhibitors can be limited to the period of antibiotic treatment.

### Proton pump inhibitors: an update [^111Y5bhT]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

Since their introduction in the late 1980s, proton pump inhibitors have demonstrated gastric acid suppression superior to that of histamine H2-receptor blockers. Proton pump inhibitors have enabled improved treatment of various acid-peptic disorders, including gastroesophageal reflux disease, peptic ulcer disease, and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug-induced gastropathy. Proton pump inhibitors have minimal side effects and few significant drug interactions, and they are generally considered safe for long-term treatment. The proton pump inhibitors omeprazole, lansoprazole, rabeprazole, and the recently approved esomeprazole appear to have similar efficacy.

### When does proton pump inhibitor treatment become long term? A scoping review [^1166HAib]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Objective

Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) use has risen substantially, primarily driven by ongoing use over months to years. However, there is no consensus on how to define long-term PPI use. Our objectives were to review and compare definitions of long-term PPI use in existing literature and describe the rationale for each definition. Moreover, we aimed to suggest generally applicable definitions for research and clinical use.

Design

The databases PubMed and Cochrane Library were searched for publications concerning long-term use of PPIs and ClinicalTrials.gov was searched for registered studies. Two reviewers independently screened the titles, abstracts, and full texts in two series and subsequently extracted data.

Results

A total of 742 studies were identified, and 59 met the eligibility criteria. In addition, two ongoing studies were identified. The definition of long-term PPI use varied from > 2 weeks to > 7 years. The most common definition was ≥ 1 year or ≥ 6 months. A total of 12/61 (20%) of the studies rationalised their definition.

Conclusion

The definitions of long-term PPI treatment varied substantially between studies and were seldom rationalised.

In a clinical context, use of PPI for more than 8 weeks could be a reasonable definition of long-term use in patients with reflux symptoms and more than 4 weeks in patients with dyspepsia or peptic ulcer. For research purposes, 6 months could be a possible definition in pharmacoepidemiological studies, whereas studies of adverse effects may require a tailored definition depending on the necessary exposure time. We recommend to always rationalise the choice of definition.

### Evaluation and management of dyspepsia [^117Aq3oo]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2010). Low credibility.

Dyspepsia is a common clinical problem seen by both primary care physicians and gastroenterologists. Initial evaluation should focus on the identification and treatment of potential causes of symptoms such as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), peptic ulcer disease, and medication side effects but also on recognizing those at risk for more serious conditions such as gastric cancer. This manuscript discusses the evaluation and management of dyspepsia including the role of proton-pump inhibitors, treatment of Helicobacter pylori, and endoscopy. Finally, treatment of refractory functional dyspepsia is addressed.

### Editorial: just how "difficult" is it to withdraw PPI treatment? [^116QQsYa]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2010). Low credibility.

Two recent studies-one of which is published in this edition of the American Journal of Gastroenterology-have reported that new dyspeptic or reflux symptoms may develop among previously asymptomatic individuals after withdrawal of a short course of a proton pump inhibitor (PPI). It has been suggested that this is attributable to rebound gastric acid hypersecretion, and that the same phenomenon explains why some patients become chronic PPI users and physicians experience "difficulty" in withdrawing PPI treatment from patients. Although we congratulate the authors of both studies for their controlled observations, we question the generalizability of these observations and hypotheses to the clinical domain. PPI treatment continues to be the optimal management strategy for most patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease and is indicated for chronic use as ulcer prophylaxis in nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug takers at high risk for bleeding. However, as with all drugs, PPIs should be dosed appropriately, and should be reserved for patients with conditions for which there is clear evidence of benefit from therapy.

### Kyoto global consensus report on Helicobacter pylori gastritis [^111HF4MX]. Gut (2015). Low credibility.

Comment

As is apparent from statement 8, there is a group of patients with FD for whom H. pylori is considered the cause of their symptoms, and this can be established if eradication is associated with sustained symptom benefit. This scenario is the only one where patients with chronic dyspeptic symptoms and a negative endoscopy can be 'cured', albeit with some delay after successful eradication therapy. Moreover, very few effective alternative therapeutic approaches have been proved to have substantial and sustained benefit in FD. Finally, eradication therapy is a short treatment, with acceptable cost–benefit for controlling dyspeptic symptoms, and with other potential benefits for prevention of peptic ulcer and gastric cancer. Based on these considerations, eradication therapy can be proposed as first-line treatment for H. pylori -infected dyspeptic patients, which is in line with a recent management algorithm by the Rome foundation.

CQ10. How effective is H. pylori eradication on dyspeptic symptoms — in the short and long term — and how does it compare with other treatments (such as proton pump inhibitors (PPIs))?

Statement 10

In H. pylori -infected dyspeptic patients, eradication therapy for dyspeptic symptoms is better than placebo and is the preferred option.

Grade of recommendation: strong

Evidence level: high

Consensus level: 97.4%

Comment

Eradication therapy studies have confirmed that a subset of H. pylori -infected patients with FD is relieved of dyspeptic symptoms by eradication therapy. To date, only a limited number of studies have directly compared eradication therapy with other treatments that are used for FD, such as PPIs or prokinetic therapy. Hence, although the symptomatic gain takes at least 6 months, eradication is the preferred treatment. Future trials should compare eradication with treatment modalities other than placebo in H pylori -infected patients with chronic dyspeptic symptoms and a negative endoscopy.

CQ11. Should patients who remain dyspeptic after successful H. pylori eradication be considered to have FD?

Statement 11

Patients who remain symptomatic after successful H. pylori eradication should be considered to have FD.

Grade of recommendation: weak

Evidence level: moderate

Consensus level: 97.4%

### The management of peptic ulcer disease [^114EVSXn]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The period under review has seen little evolution in our understanding of the empiric management of dyspepsia. The role of Helicobacter pylori in this setting remains controversial, and a policy of risk stratification with the prudent use of test and treat and symptomatic therapy, with endoscopy for nonresponsive cases, seems to have some support from the literature in this period.

Recent Findings

The management of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug-associated and aspirin-associated complications has received a lot of attention in the period under review. The COX-2 selective agents have maintained their reputation as safer (but not "safe") options, although some of the original work with one of these agents has been rigorously interrogated and found wanting. Studies in the review period have focused our attention on the less than satisfactory protection of proton pump inhibitor cotherapy, the site-specific nature of ulcer recurrences (which may have therapeutic implications), lower gastroenterology complications associated with NSAID use, and the beneficial effect of proton pump inhibitor cotherapy for patients receiving low-dose aspirin. One should also expect a lot more information in the future with regard to the use of the nitric oxide donating class of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs and aspirin.

Summary

Findings are presented that suggest that the H.pylori stool antigen test is not as reliable as the urea breath test, while the most promising "new therapy" for H. pylori is not new, but rather an amalgam of some older drugs combined in a new "quadruple" therapy strategy, which shows some promise.

### Inhibiting the proton pump: mechanisms, benefits, harms, and questions [^116CmbRZ]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Inhibition of the H + /K + -adenosine triphosphatase (the proton pump) is the final common mechanistic pathway in reducing gastric acid secretion pharmacologically. Proton pump inhibitors are widely used in upper gastrointestinal diseases, including gastric and duodenal ulcers, eradication of Helicobacter pylori in combination with antibiotics, gastroesophageal reflux disease, Zollinger–Ellison syndrome, eosinophilic esophagitis, and prevention of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug-induced peptic ulceration. Reviewing their benefits and harms in BMC Medicine, Scarpignato et al. report effectiveness in these conditions, and harms that are generally mild and uncommon (1–3%). Serious adverse reactions, such as tubulointerstitial nephritis, are rare. However, the risks of gastric and pancreatic cancer are unclear. Drug–drug interactions can occur through effects on P glycoprotein and cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoenzymes. Several questions remain. Do all proton pump inhibitors carry the same risks of serious adverse reactions? Which individuals are most susceptible? What are the time courses of individual reactions? What monitoring strategies are best? New drugs for the same indications continue to emerge, including potassium-competitive acid blockers, inhibitors of transient lower esophageal sphincter relaxation, serotonergic agents/prokinetics, mucosal protectants, histamine H 3 receptor agonists, anti-gastrin agents, and esophageal pain modulators. Their benefit to harm balance remains to be discovered.

### Effectiveness of management strategies for uninvestigated dyspepsia: systematic review and network meta-analysis [^111aRNbQ]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Symptom based management was ranked the lowest of all the strategies when considering effectiveness. Management of dyspepsia with drug treatments is unsatisfactory and often lacks an adequate evidence base because the underlying causes of symptoms are poorly understood. This makes targeted drug interventions empirical at best. Patients with dyspepsia might be treated with a variety of drugs, depending on local availability and approval, physicians' personal experience, and to some extent, on assessment of an individual patient's symptom profile. Recent guidelines recommend the use of empirical proton pump inhibitor treatment for patients younger than 60 in whom "test and treat" is unsuccessful and in those without H pylori infection. Although acid suppression with a proton pump inhibitor might be effective for some patients, their long term efficacy is unclear and the optimal duration of treatment is not defined. In patients whose dyspeptic symptoms do not respond to a proton pump inhibitor, there is no value in continuing with this treatment. Furthermore, recent concerns about the long term safety of these drugs, although often based on weak evidence, could have altered perceptions of their appropriateness for the long term management of dyspepsia. Additional drug interventions that could be used for the management of dyspepsia include drugs with presumed prokinetic effectsand neuromodulators, including tricyclic antidepressants. The role of prokinetic agents is limited because of their lack of availability in many countries. Neuromodulators have an important role in the management of dyspepsia and other functional gastrointestinal disorders. However, the decision to use any of these drugs, and the order in which they might be tried, is based on choices made by individual physicians and patients, and to some extent is influenced by the factors listed here. Therefore, it is perhaps unsurprising that this largely empirical strategy was the least effective.

### Medical management of patients with esophageal or supraesophageal gastroesophageal reflux disease [^114AUFP2]. The American Journal of Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

With the common use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), the medical treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and its complications is now successful in relieving symptoms, healing esophagitis, and preventing complications. Physiologic factors that may contribute to a poor response to these drugs include the considerable variation in the bioavailability of PPIs, the need to take PPIs with meals, the influence of Helicobacter pylori-associated gastritis, and genetic variation in enzyme capacity, resulting in rapid and slow metabolizers of PPIs. Subsets of reflux patients, such as the elderly, pregnant women, and those with supraesophageal symptoms or Barrett esophagus, may have special treatment requirements. Medical treatment of GERD with PPIs has been demonstrated to equal the success of antireflux surgery in short- and long-term follow-up with reasonably few side effects. Furthermore, a good response to PPI therapy predicts a successful outcome with antireflux surgery.

### Control of gastric acid secretion in health and disease [^114Ra3Kc]. Gastroenterology (2008). Low credibility.

Recent milestones in the understanding of gastric acid secretion and treatment of acid-peptic disorders include the (1) discovery of histamine H(2)-receptors and development of histamine H(2)-receptor antagonists, (2) identification of H(+)K(+)-ATPase as the parietal cell proton pump and development of proton pump inhibitors, and (3) identification of Helicobacter pylori as the major cause of duodenal ulcer and development of effective eradication regimens. This review emphasizes the importance and relevance of gastric acid secretion and its regulation in health and disease. We review the physiology and pathophysiology of acid secretion as well as evidence regarding its inhibition in the management of acid-related clinical conditions.

Management of Helicobacter pylori infection is evolving and in this 4th edition of the Maastricht consensus report aspects related to the clinical role of H pylori were looked at again in 2010. In the 4th Maastricht/Florence Consensus Conference 44 experts from 24 countries took active part and examined key clinical aspects in three subdivided workshops: (1) Indications and contraindications for diagnosis and treatment, focusing on dyspepsia, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or aspirin use, gastro-oesophageal reflux disease and extraintestinal manifestations of the infection. (2) Diagnostic tests and treatment of infection. (3) Prevention of gastric cancer and other complications. The results of the individual workshops were submitted to a final consensus voting to all participants. Recommendations are provided on the basis of the best current evidence and plausibility to guide doctors involved in the management of this infection associated with various clinical conditions.

### Gastric functions&proton pump inhibitor (PPI) study… [^113wuTpM]. ClinicalTrials (2009). Low credibility.

Demographic data and anthropometric measurements will be obtained for baseline assessment. Patients are required to complete FGI Screening Questionnaire, Functional dyspepsia symptom questionnaire, gastroesophageal reflux disease symptom questionnaire and irritable bowel syndrome symptom questionnaire to have a thorough assessment of their GI symptoms. Satiety test and ghrelin profile, and gastric emptying test will be arranged as two individual visits. Hypothesis: Long-term PPI relieves dyspeptic symptom through acceleration of gastric emptying rate. Background Functional dyspepsia is one of the commonest digestive disorders. It is a functional gastrointestinal disorder which is characterized by chronic recurrent epigastric symptoms such as pain, burning and a variety of postprandial symptoms with absence of demonstrable organic pathology identified on investigations. It has been reported that functional dyspepsia affects 10–30% of adult population.

The pathophysiology of functional dyspepsia is uncertain. It is thought to be a heterogeneous disorder. Various factors have been implicated in the pathophysiology of functional dyspepsia. It has been reported that delayed gastric emptying, impaired proximal gastric accommodation, visceral hypersensitivity and Helicobacter pylori gastritis play a role in development of functional dyspepsia. However, the correlation between these physiological abnormalities and symptomatology of functional dyspepsia is poor. It is still controversial whether these pathophysiological factors are responsible for specific symptoms in functional dyspepsia. While mechanism of functional dyspepsia is unclear, treatment has also been far from satisfactory. Proton pump inhibitor has been recommended as the first line treatment for functional dyspepsia and it has been shown that the use of PPI is associated with a 14% reduction in risk of persistent dyspepsia compared to placebo.

However, the mechanism of symptom relief is unclear. While PPI exerts its effect primarily through suppression of acid-induced symptoms, recent studies have shown that PPI may affect gastric motility function such as gastric volume, gastric emptying and trigger of migratory motor complex. Most of these studies were performed on healthy volunteers who received only a very short course of PPI. The correlation between symptom and gastric emptying is lacking in these studies.

### Effective and safe proton pump inhibitor therapy in acid-related diseases – A position paper addressing benefits and potential harms of acid suppression [^115p6Zif]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

In all those patients with GERD requiring long-term PPI therapy, H. pylori should be sought and – if present – eradicated, particularly in young patients. This approach, recommended by international guidelines, is needed to prevent the development of atrophic gastritis or worsening of any preexisting one, with potential for neoplastic transformation. However, in accordance with the Food and Drug Administration, ACG guidelines do not recommend routine screening for or treatment of H. pylori infection in GERD patients (strong recommendation, low level of evidence).

Conversely from typical symptoms, the efficacy of PPIs on extra-esophageal manifestations of GERD is uncertain. This uncertainty could result, at least in part, from the available studies, which are not homogenous, with differences in patient selection, end-point considered, drug used, and regimen adopted. In addition, since extra-digestive symptoms may need higher PPI dose and clinical improvement may take a longer time to occur, only properly designed trials would be able to unravel a clinical response. Unfortunately, however, this has not always been the case.

The efficacy of PPIs in non-cardiac chest pain and extra-digestive GERD is disappointing. In these clinical conditions, PPIs are usually given twice daily and for extended periods (i.e. 3 or more months). However, evidence is often lacking and, where available, not strong enough to allow clear recommendations to be made.

With GERD being the most common and best-studied cause of non-cardiac chest pain, acid suppression is the initial pharmacological approach in this patient population. A systematic review showed that patients with endoscopic or pH-monitoring evidence of GERD tend to improve, but not resolve, with PPI therapy, whereas GERD-negative patients display little or no response, a result confirmed by a more recent meta-analysis. PPIs might also improve symptoms related to atrial fibrillation and other supraventricular arrhythmias, especially after meals, in patients with proven GERD.

Proton pump inhibitor dosing and potency — enteric-coated proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) control intragastric pH best when given before meals, specifically "30–60 minutes before breakfast for once-daily dosing and 30–60 minutes before breakfast and dinner for twice-daily dosing", and "Bedtime dosing is discouraged". Relative antisecretory potency differs across agents, with "pantoprazole, lansoprazole, omeprazole, esomeprazole, and rabeprazole" estimated at "0.23, 0.9, 1.00, 1.60, and 1.82 OEs, respectively". For persistent symptoms, switching PPIs is reasonable, and in a randomized study of patients on lansoprazole 30 mg once daily, "double the dose of lansoprazole" vs "switch to esomeprazole 40 mg once daily" were "equally effective", with "approximately 55%" in each arm improving; an omeprazole–sodium bicarbonate bedtime formulation "provides good control of intragastric pH in the first 4 hours of sleep".

### Effective and safe proton pump inhibitor therapy in acid-related diseases – A position paper addressing benefits and potential harms of acid suppression [^116fW86B]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Since some drug classes (e.g. NSAIDs, calcium channel blockers, corticosteroids, ACE inhibitors, and methylxanthines) can induce dyspeptic symptoms, a careful evaluation of the current drug therapy is of paramount importance: dyspeptogenic medications should be withdrawn whenever possible. In patients with NSAID-associated dyspepsia, PPIs are effective and should be given also with the aim of preventing adverse GI events (see below).

The role of H. pylori in FD is supported by data from meta-analyses showing that H. pylori eradication resulted in a statistically significant benefit compared with placebo (relative risk of remaining dyspeptic 0.90; NNT = 13). However, short-term benefit is often not evident since symptom relief becomes significant only some (up to 6) months after successful cure of the infection. Furthermore, PPIs represent a key component of all the commonly used eradication regimens (triple, quadruple, sequential, concomitant or hybrid therapies).

It has been estimated that the H. pylori "test and treat" strategy is cost-effective in those regions where prevalence of the infection is > 20%, as in Italy, and that the advantage persists at long-term follow-up. Unfortunately, no predictive factors for clinical benefit have been identified, so that eradication treatments should be attempted in all dyspeptic patients. H. pylori should be investigated with either non-invasive tests or upper endoscopy, according to the age of the patient and the presence of alarm symptoms.

In patients with dyspeptic symptoms persisting despite successful eradication or naïve uninfected patients with EPS, PPI therapy can be attempted, an approach achieving a success rate of 34% (NNT = 10, 95% confidence interval, 7–33). PPIs are particularly effective when overlapping reflux symptoms are present, while no significant benefit occurs in dyspeptic patients with PDS. It is worth emphasizing that the effect of PPIs in FD occurs at standard doses and, since meta-analyses found no dose-response effect, escalating the dose in non-responders to standard doses should not be considered. If breakthrough symptoms occur, antacids or alginate-containing formulations may be used. Differentely from GERD, a long-term therapy with PPIs in FD is not indicated. After successful treatment, a tapering strategy rather than abrupt discontinuation is preferred. Although symptoms may recur in nearly 70% of patients within 1-year follow-up, re-starting treatment only in these patients is more advantageous than a continuous and expensive treatment, prescribed in all cases.

New diagnostic tests for H. pylori infection have been evaluated, and rescue therapies for failed H. pylori eradication have been tested. The causal relationship between H. pylori infection and nonulcer dyspepsia, gastric cancer, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and NSAID-related ulcers remained heated topics of debate. In 2000, landmark clinical trials and meta-analyses were published addressing these issues. The role of endoscopy in managing nonulcer dyspepsia was better defined. The role of H. pylori eradication in NSAID/aspirin users was reexamined in high-risk patients. Clinical benefit was finally confirmed for specific inhibitors of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). The millennium year turned out to be a very important one in the advancement of knowledge in this field.

Data suggest that there is no value in doubling the dose of PPI therapy so the drug should be discontinued if the patient does not respond after 8 weeks of standard dose, once-daily therapy.

### When does proton pump inhibitor treatment become long term? A scoping review [^116ArBBA]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Discussion

Main findings

In our review we were able to identify 61 studies on different aspects related to long-term use of PPIs. The definitions of long-term use varied substantially between studies and consensus in the literature on how to define long-term use of PPIs is lacking. One in five studies stated an explanation for their choice of definition.

Comparison with previous literature

To our knowledge this is the first study systematically assessing the different definitions used in studies of long-term use of PPIs. In a review from 2005, Raghunath et al mention that there is no consensus on how to define long-term use and state the definitions used in some previous studies without attempting to establish a consensus-based definition. Additionally, a substantial amount of studies have emerged since 2005 and a new evaluation was required.

Implications

The substantial variability in definitions of long-term use makes it challenging to compare studies in this area. For example, it is difficult to compare the range, burden and magnitude of extended continuous PPI therapy when definitions of 'long-term' use vary widely. More uniform definitions could improve these aspects and allow for more reliable conclusions to be drawn across available studies.

In a clinical context, several guidelines on PPI prescribing exist, but definitions of long-term use are often lacking. An appropriate time to discuss ongoing use may be after an initial course of PPI is finished (eg, at 2–4 weeks for uninvestigated dyspepsia) to avoid ongoing use without indication. For several studies of patients with non-erosive reflux disease/gastro-oesophageal reflux disease identified in this review, long-term use was defined as using > 4 or > 8 weeks. This may reflect the fact that efficacy trials demonstrate healing of oesophagitis with 4–8 weeks of PPI, which is also reflected in guideline recommendations.

Source: Investigators from Duke-NUS Medical School and KK Women's and Children's Hospital, both in Singapore, conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the effect of stress ulcer prophylaxis in children admitted to a pediatric ICU on the rate of gastrointestinal bleeding and nosocomial pneumonia. For the study they used a standardized process to identify published studies that included children ≤ 18 years old who were admitted to a PICU and placed on either a histamine 2-receptor antagonist or proton-pump inhibitor for SUP. Studies were selected that included data on 1 of the following outcomes: GI bleeding, nosocomial pneumonia, length of PICU stay, or mortality. Both randomized controlled trials and observational studies that included data for 1 or more of these outcomes in both patients placed on SUP and no ulcer prophylaxis were eligible for inclusion in the meta-analysis.

Studies on use of PPI or H2RA for treatment rather than prophylaxis and those that included NICU patients were excluded. The primary outcomes were rate of GI bleeding and nosocomial pneumonia. Secondary outcomes included length of PICU stay and mortality. Data from the relevant studies were pooled, and differences in these outcomes among patients placed on SUP, or not, were assessed using Mantel-Haenzel risk difference or standardized mean difference assessments. Among 336, 234 patients from 3 studies, mortality rates were significantly higher in those given SUP vs no prophylaxis. However, this difference was largely due to the inclusion of data from 1 very large study. There was no statistical association between length of PICU stay and use of SUP.

The authors conclude that SUP does not clearly reduce the rate of GI bleeding in PICU patients and may lead to higher risks of nosocomial pneumonia and mortality. Dr Bratton has disclosed no financial relationship relevant to this commentary. This commentary does not contain a discussion of an unapproved/investigative use of a commercial product/device. The authors of the current meta-analysis report lack of efficacy and concern for harm with SUP. However. Comments.

Use of the lowest effective dose is recommended and logical but must be individualized. Abrupt PPI discontinuation may lead to potential rebound acid hypersecretion and increased reflux symptoms, yet strong evidence for an increase in symptoms after abrupt PPI withdrawal is lacking.

### Proton pump inhibitors for functional dyspepsia [^1165fiN9]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Functional dyspepsia (FD or non-ulcer dyspepsia) is defined as continuous or frequently recurring epigastric pain or discomfort for which no organic cause can be found. Acid suppressive therapy, including proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), has been proposed as a therapeutic option in FD, but its efficacy remains controversial. While PPIs are generally considered safe and well tolerated, they have been associated with adverse events, especially in the long term. For this reason, decisions on whether to initiate or continue PPI therapy should be made based on an appropriate clinical indication. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review to evaluate whether PPI therapy provides symptomatic relief in FD.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy of proton pump inhibitors in the improvement of global symptoms of dyspepsia and quality of life compared to placebo, H2 receptor antagonists or prokinetics, in people with functional dyspepsia.

Search Methods

We searched in the following electronic databases: the Cochrane Library (to January 2016), MEDLINE (OvidSP; to February 2016), Embase (OvidSP; to February 2016), and SIGLE grey literature (up to February 2016) and clinical trial registries; we handsearched abstracts from conferences up to February 2016. We screened non-systematic reviews, systematic reviews and guidelines to identify any additional trials. We contacted trialists to obtain missing information.

Selection Criteria

All randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing any PPI with placebo, H2 receptor antagonists (H2RAs) or prokinetics for the treatment of FD. Participants were adults (aged 16 years or greater) with an adequate diagnosis of FD (any validated criteria such as Rome I, II, III or Lancet Working Group).

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed eligibility, trial quality and extracted data. We collected data on dyspeptic symptoms, quality of life and number of overall adverse events. Specific adverse events were beyond the scope of this review.

Main Results

We identified 23 RCTs from 22 papers (with 8759 participants) studying the effect of PPIs versus placebo, H2RAs or prokinetics for improvement of global symptoms of dyspepsia and quality of life in people with FD. Low-dose PPIs had similar efficacy as standard-dose PPIs, therefore we combined these subgroups for the analysis. Two to eight weeks of therapy with PPI was slightly more effective than placebo at relieving overall dyspepsia symptoms in people with FD (risk ratio (RR) 0.88, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.82 to 0.94; participants = 5968; studies = 16; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 13; moderate quality evidence). PPIs may be slightly more effective than H2RAs (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.04; participants = 740; studies = 2, NNTB 13; low quality evidence), and slightly more effective than prokinetics (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.00; participants = 892; studies = 4; NNTB 20; low quality evidence) at relieving overall dyspepsia symptoms in people with FD. PPIs plus prokinetics were possibly slightly more effective than PPIs alone at relieving overall dyspepsia symptoms (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.08; participants = 407; studies = 2; NNTB 18; moderate quality evidence). The was no difference when subgrouped by Helicobacter pylori status, country of origin, or presence of reflux or Rome III subtypes. There were no differences in the number of adverse events observed between PPIs and any of the other treatments.

Authors' Conclusions

There is evidence that PPIs are effective for the treatment of FD, independent of the dose and duration of treatment compared with placebo. PPIs may be slightly more effective than H2RAs for the treatment of FD; however, the evidence is scarce. The trials evaluating PPIs versus prokinetics are difficult to interpret as they are at risk of bias. Although the effect of these drugs seems to be small, the drugs are well tolerated.

### Treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection. indications and regimens: an update [^111njafG]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2002). Low credibility.

The management of Helicobacter pylori infection is still surrounded by controversy and uncertainties. Indications and correct application of current regimens for Helicobacter pylori infection are still considered a matter of debate. Regarding indications, only peptic ulcer and mucosa associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma are considered clear indications for treatment. In other conditions, such as atrophic gastritis, post gastric cancer resection, first-degree relatives of gastric cancer patients, dyspeptic patients, patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug users, the value of Helicobacter pylori eradication is still controversial. The regimens for first-line and second-line treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection have been recommended by the Maastricht 2 Consensus Report. Although all the treatments are considered to be effective, physicians still do not agree on what first-line regimen should be used. Furthermore, a consensus on the duration of the antibiotic treatment is still lacking, although Maastricht guidelines for treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection recommend a one-week therapy. Also regimens, as a third-line treatment, and methods to improve compliance and clinical outcome are still a matter of debate. All these points will be considered in the present review

### Initial management strategies for dyspepsia [^113WRAwT]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Background

This review considers management strategies (combinations of initial investigation and empirical treatments) for dyspeptic patients. Dyspepsia was defined to include both epigastric pain and heartburn.

Objectives

To determine the effectiveness, acceptability, and cost effectiveness of the following initial management strategies for patients presenting with dyspepsia: (a) Initial pharmacological therapy (including endoscopy for treatment failures). (b) Early endoscopy. (c) Testing for Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori)and endoscope only those positive. (d) H. pylori eradication therapy with or without prior testing.

Search Strategy

Trials were located through electronic searches and extensive contact with trialists.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials of dyspeptic patients presenting in primary care.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were collected on dyspeptic symptoms, quality of life and use of resources. An individual patient data meta-analysis of health economic data was conducted

Main Results

Twenty-five papers reporting 27 comparisons were found. Trials comparing proton pump inhibitors (PPI) with antacids (three trials) and histamine H2-receptor antagonists (H2RAs) (three trials), early endoscopy with initial acid suppression (five trials), H. pylori test and endoscope versus usual management (three trials), H. pylori test and treat versus endoscopy (six trials), and test and treat versus acid suppression alone in H. pylori positive patients (four trials), were pooled. PPIs were significantly more effective than both H2RAs and antacids. Relative risks (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were; for PPI compared with antacid 0.72 (95% CI 0.64 to 0.80), PPI compared with H2RA 0.63 (95% CI 0.47 to 0.85). Results for other drug comparisons were either absent or inconclusive. Initial endoscopy was associated with a small reduction in the risk of recurrent dyspeptic symptoms compared with H. pylori test and treat (OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.96), but was not cost effective (mean additional cost of endoscopy US$401 (95% CI $328 to 474). Test and treat may be more effective than acid suppression alone (RR 0.59 95% CI 0.42 to 0.83).

Authors' Conclusions

Proton pump inhibitor drugs (PPIs) are effective in the treatment of dyspepsia in these trials which may not adequately exclude patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD). The relative efficacy of histamine H2-receptor antagonists (H2RAs) and PPIs is uncertain. Early investigation by endoscopy or H. pylori testing may benefit some patients with dyspepsia but is not cost effective as part of an overall management strategy.

### Update on the management of upper gastrointestinal bleeding [^111GTgkQ]. BMJ Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Proton pump inhibitors

Use of proton pump inhibitors before endoscopy might reduce the need for endoscopic treatment at index endoscopy, but does not improve more clinically relevant endpoints, therefore, use in this situation is not advocated by National Institute for Health and Care Excellence. This advice is based on a meta-analysis of six studies comprising 2223 patients, which showed no significant reduction in mortality (odds ratio 1.12, 95% confidence interval 0.72 to 1.73), rebleeding (0.81, 0.61 to 1.09), or need for surgery (0.96, 0.68 to 1.35). Despite this guidance, the 2015 UK National Confidential Enquiry into Patient Outcome and Death report found that 150 (73%) of 206 patients had acid suppression started before definitive diagnosis, which was thought likely owing to clinicians' desires to start a specific treatment when managing a haemorrhage. European, Asian-Pacific, International, and US guidelines are not consistent on the use of proton pump inhibitors, with some suggesting that these compounds could have a role in the context of delayed endoscopy in consideration of relative costs of proton pump inhibitors and endotherapy.

### Therapeutic regimens againstinfection without proton pump inhibitors in patients with corpus atrophic gastritis: a real-life single-centre longitudinal observational study [^112CsUHZ]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Figure 2.
Clinical management protocol.

Table 1.
Baseline characteristics of the 76 corpus atrophic gastritis patients with histologically assessed Helicobacter pylori infection.

To assess the tolerability and the eradication rate of the modified eradication regimens without PPIs in patients with corpus atrophic gastritis, the number and the type of adverse events and the number and proportion of patients successfully cured of infection were evaluated in all patients who completed treatment and underwent the second histological assessment.

To assess whether eradication rates of treatment regimens without PPIs were non-inferior to those with PPIs, we compared the rates obtained in corpus atrophic gastritis patients with a group of 49 patients with histologically H. pylori -positive chronic superficial non-atrophic gastritis, treated with the same eradication regimens, but with PPIs. In these patients, analogously to patients with corpus atrophic gastritis, treatment efficacy was assessed by histology on biopsies taken during a second gastroscopy performed after 6 ± 3 months from the end of the eradication therapy. In our centre, we routinely propose histological assessment of treatment efficacy in patients at higher risk for gastric cancer, that is positive family history of gastric cancer or corpus-involving H. pylori positive superficial gastritis. In detail, this group was selected amongst n = 693 consecutive patients undergoing first-time gastroscopy with biopsies for dyspepsia, anaemia, reflux symptoms and/or family history of gastric cancer between 2016 and 2022; n = 553 patients were excluded because they were H. pylori negative; n = 140 patients were diagnosed with histologically H. pylori -positive chronic superficial non-atrophic gastritis and treated with eradication regimens with PPIs; n = 91 of them were not considered because they did not adhere to undergo a second gastroscopy to assess treatment efficacy or were lost at follow-up, and, therefore, 49 patients (49% females, median age 56, range 22–81 years) with histological H. pylori -positive chronic superficial non-atrophic gastritis and histological assessment of treatment efficacy were included for analysis.

Written informed consent was provided by all participants, and approval of the local ethical committee was achieved (No. 7022/2020). Patients' details have been anonymized in such a way that the original identifying characteristics have been removed and, therefore, they cannot be linked back to any specific person, even if combined with other information sources. For that reason, patients' consent for publication does not apply to this study.

### Insights into the evaluation and management of dyspepsia: recent developments and new guidelines [^114b7c8c]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Theoretically, therefore, the GastroPanel could be used as a noninvasive test to screen patients presenting with dyspepsia, in order to identify those who are at increased risk of gastric cancer, which in turn could be used to prioritize access to upper GI endoscopy. Those patients who test positive would undergo upper GI endoscopy to rule out gastric cancer, or else hopefully detect it at an early more treatable, or preferably even a premalignant, stage. Conversely, patients who tested negative would be presumed to have FD and be managed accordingly.

Whether such an approach is viable depends both on the performance of the test, and whether it is cost-effective. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis of 20 studies using biomarker panels for detecting H. pylori and atrophic gastritis, 19 of which used the GastroPanel, deemed the test to be reliable for the diagnosis of atrophic gastritis. The authors reported a pooled sensitivity of 74.7% (95% CI 62.0%–84.3%), and a pooled specificity of 95.6% (95% CI 92.6%–97.4%). The median prevalence of atrophic gastritis across these studies was 27%, and the negative predictive value was 91%. In other words, 91 of 100 participants with a negative test would not have atrophic gastritis. However, if a patient is taking a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) caution is advised, as PPI use increases the probability of a false negative test. As the authors acknowledged, the meta-analysis was based on studies of low methodological quality, with the potential for various sources of bias, and there remains a need for well-designed studies, with large sample sizes, to adequately evaluate the performance of the GastroPanel.

It is also unclear whether use of the GastroPanel is cost-effective in the management of dyspepsia. Although cost-effectiveness analyses of serum biomarkers have been conducted, the majority of these were in very specific populations at high risk of gastric cancer, identified for screening based on their age, rather than upper GI symptoms, – which does not help in determining whether this test has a role in the management of undiagnosed dyspepsia. Moreover, all of these studies only considered pepsinogen testing alone, rather than as part of a combined panel of biomarkers. In summary, therefore, there is currently insufficient evidence to recommend the use of combined serum biomarkers, such as GastroPanel, in the investigation of dyspepsia.

### Management of the dyspeptic patient: anything goes? [^114Mk8tQ]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2006). Low credibility.

Guidelines on the initial management of dyspeptic patients are remarkably conflicting or ambiguous and recommend a variety of initial approaches and no single strategy has been successfully implemented in primary care. In this issue of the American Journal of Gastroenterology, Jarbol and colleagues report the results of a large Danish trial comparing a test-and-treat strategy, an empiric PPI strategy, and a combined strategy with Helicobacter testing if symptoms improved after the PPI. Patient-related outcomes at 1 yr did not differ, but the use of endoscopy was highest in the PPI strategy. From the patient's perspective it seems that anything goes as long as the clinician sticks to a well-defined and proven strategy. Helicobacter pylori testing is still recommendable owing to the long-term benefits, but the rapidly decreasing Helicobacter prevalence will soon make the test-and-treat strategy cost-ineffective as the initial step.

### Proton-pump inhibitors should be strictly prescribed in clinic [^1135LMyy]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Just as the authors mentioned in the articles, the study indeed has some limitations. Even though many confounding factors were included in this meta-analysis, the largest study still provided a relative reliable evidence on PPI use and gastric cancer. As we all know, the carcinogenesis of gastric cancer is a multistep and long-time process, of which the superficial gastritis, atrophic gastritis, dysplasia, and cancer are the classical processes. Therefore, all the factors that could affect the stomach mucosa status may influence the relationship between PPI use and the risk of gastric cancer. Furthermore, the difference in PPI indications could also lead to the variations of the risk of gastric cancer. For example, PPI use for HP eradication or atrophic gastritis makes it difficult to accurately evaluate the PPI used and the risk of gastric cancer, considering the close relationship of these factors with gastric cancer. All the included studies do not have enough and detailed information; therefore, the meta-analysis of these factors is not able to precisely identify the relationships between PPI use and gastric cancer. However, the conclusions they get could still provide some foundation for doctors.

### Therapeutic regimens againstinfection without proton pump inhibitors in patients with corpus atrophic gastritis: a real-life single-centre longitudinal observational study [^111hr79z]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In conclusion, the current study shows that in clinical practice, the cure of H. pylori infection can be achieved without concomitant PPIs in about 90% of patients with corpus atrophic gastritis who do not have an indication to suppress acid secretion due to their disease-related acid secretion impairment. In this specific clinical setting, a bismuth-based regimen (SPBT) without PPI association was highly effective and well tolerated.

### Risk of GI bleeding highest with rivaroxaban, lower with apixaban… [^114N4f2F]. AAFP (2019). Medium credibility.

Clinical Question Which oral anticoagulants have the highest risk of causing upper gastrointestinal tract bleeding, and does cotherapy with a proton pump inhibitor lower that risk. Bottom Line Among patients using oral anticoagulants alone, the risk of hospitalization for upper GI tract bleeding is highest with rivaroxaban and lowest with apixaban. Cotherapy with a PPI reduces the risk among patients using any oral anticoagulant. Synopsis The risk of serious upper GI tract bleeding associated with individual anticoagulant drug choice is uncertain. These investigators analyzed the U. S. Medicare beneficiary files of patients 30 years or older who initiated oral anticoagulation treatment with apixaban, dabigatran, rivaroxaban, or warfarin.

The primary outcome of interest was hospitalization for upper GI tract bleeding that is potentially preventable by PPI cotherapy, including esophagitis, peptic ulcer disease, and gastritis. Multiple analyses occurred to control for covariates, including cardiovascular disease, low-dose aspirin prophylaxis, frailty, alcohol abuse, liver disease, history of previous upper GI tract bleeding, current use of other medications that affect bleeding risk, and age and other demographic factors. In patients receiving anticoagulant treatment without PPI cotherapy, the adjusted incidence of hospitalization for upper GI tract bleeding was significantly higher in those who received rivaroxaban compared with those who received dabigatran, warfarin, or apixaban.

For patients receiving anticoagulant treatment with PPI cotherapy, the adjusted incidence of severe upper GI tract bleeding was lower than for patients not receiving cotherapy for all anticoagulants, although still significantly highest with rivaroxaban.

### Functional dyspepsia [^112vzU6b]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Functional dyspepsia is a common disorder, most of the time of unknown etiology and with variable pathophysiology. Therapy has been and still is largely empirical. Data from recent studies provide new clues for targeted therapy based on knowledge of etiology and pathophysiologic mechanisms.

Recent Findings

The role of Helicobacter pylori gastritis in the pathogenesis of functional dyspepsia has been defined: It is causative in a small minority of patients. Associations between (groups of) symptoms and pathophysiologic mechanisms have been established, but there is much overlap and interaction, and their relevance for the individual patient is uncertain, especially because of the variability of symptoms over time. Little progress has been made in pharmacotherapy of functional dyspepsia, but exploratory studies show interesting new options. Hypnotherapy seems a promising alternative.

Summary

For the time being, diagnostic strategies for patients with suspected functional dyspepsia continue to be directed at excluding other disorders, in particular peptic ulcer disease and gastroesophageal reflux disease. In the presence of reflux symptoms, acid inhibitory therapy, preferably with a proton pump inhibitor, is a rational choice; otherwise, therapy is still empirical. Hypnotherapy is an option that could be seriously considered.

### Discontinuing long-term PPI therapy: why, with whom, and how? [^114fPPGc]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are among the most widely used class of drugs prescribed over the long term in all of clinical medicine with 8–10% of ambulatory adults have been prescribed a PPI in the past 30 days. However, numerous studies have raised doubts about the long term safety of PPI use. The purpose of this review is threefold: (i) To provide an overview of the current evidence demonstrating associations between PPI use and adverse health outcomes and the likelihood of the associations being causal (Why?); (ii) To be able to identify long-term PPI users in whom the intensity of PPI therapy could be reduced or in whom PPIs could be eliminated outright (Who?); and (iii) To provide strategies on how to reduce or stop chronic PPI therapy while maintaining symptom control and reducing the risk for symptom or upper GI disease recurrence (How?).

Proton pump inhibitor drugs (PPIs) are effective in the treatment of dyspepsia in these trials which may not adequately exclude patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD). The relative efficacy of histamine H2-receptor antagonists (H2RAs) and PPIs is uncertain. Early investigation by endoscopy or H. pylori testing may benefit some patients with dyspepsia but is not cost effective as part of an overall management strategy.

### Therapeutic regimens againstinfection without proton pump inhibitors in patients with corpus atrophic gastritis: a real-life single-centre longitudinal observational study [^1111RMY3]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Helicobacter pylori infection is the main cause of chronic gastritis and gastric cancer; around 90% of gastric cancer cases can be attributed to the infection. H. pylori eradication should be considered as the main therapeutic strategy to reduce the progression towards gastric precancerous conditions, such as atrophy, intestinal metaplasia and cancerous lesions. – Proposed treatment regimens are mainly bismuth based on Western guidelines and less commonly sequential or hybrid regimens.– Randomized clinical trials showed that classical bismuth quadruple therapies combining bismuth with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), metronidazole and tetracycline are more effective than triple therapies. – Interest in this therapy grew and the difficulties related to the multi-pill administration have been elegantly overcome with the commercialization of a single-pill-bismuth-based therapy (SPBT) that showed high efficacy in clinical trials and clinical practice. However, the results of these trials were mainly obtained from patients with chronic superficial, non-atrophic H. pylori gastritis, not considering the peculiar condition of corpus atrophic gastritis. This is a chronic inflammatory condition characterized by partial or complete loss of the gastric corpus glands, replaced by pseudo-pyloric or intestinal metaplasia, or fibrosis, and consequent impairment of the gastric acid secretion. For this reason, in corpus atrophic gastritis, the use of PPIs is questionableand it has even been reported to be harmful increasing the risk of gastric cancer. Concurrently, the efficacy of the common treatment regimens against H. pylori with two or more antibiotics without associating PPIs in corpus atrophic gastritis may not be equivalent to that observed associating PPIs in patients with H. pylori gastritis and preserved gastric acid secretion. Still, data on this issue are completely lacking. Thus, the current study aimed to assess the tolerability and the eradication rate of modified eradication regimens without using PPIs in patients with corpus atrophic gastritis as first-line treatment of H. pylori infection.

### Effective and safe proton pump inhibitor therapy in acid-related diseases – A position paper addressing benefits and potential harms of acid suppression [^111ofaxZ]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

PPIs are among the safest class of drugs. Although concerns have been raised on their long-term safety, the preponderance of evidence does not strongly support the concerns, publicized over the last few years, and the absolute risk is probably low. Some adverse effects are plausible and predictable; others are idiosyncratic, unpredictable, and rare. Based on the quality of the existing evidence, the benefits of PPI treatment outweigh the potential risks in most patients, especially if PPI use is based on a relevant and appropriate indication. Conversely, patients treated without an appropriate therapeutic indication are only exposed to potential risks and the benefit-to-harm balance becomes very low. Consequently, the overall focus should be on the appropriateness of PPI therapy and on a regular assessment of the need for continued PPI treatment.

Nearly all the adverse outcomes associated with PPIs occur among patients who receive long-term therapy; minimizing the duration of treatment by periodically reviewing a patient's need for acid-suppressive therapy could eliminate or substantially reduce the risk of adverse outcomes. Therefore, during continued long-term use, the clinical effects should always be reviewed and attempts be made to stop any therapy that may not be needed. It is imperative to use the lowest dose of drug required to achieve the desired therapeutic goals. This may entail implementing discontinuation of treatment in asymptomatic patients as well as step-down, intermittent, or on-demand PPI therapy for maintenance of GERD. It should be emphasized, however, that PPI treatment in GERD is merely palliative in nature, since it does not address the underlying pathophysiology, something only ARS is able to achieve. Therefore, in young fit patients needing continuous acid suppression, fundoplication should be considered. Intermittent or on-demand PPI therapy is not suitable for NSAID users, since the risk of serious GI events is constant in those patients with GI risk factors and can persist for some time after stopping therapy.

H. pylori infection unless there is documentation that the infection was previously cured. Patients with low-grade gastric mucosa–associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma or a history of endoscopic resection of early gastric cancer should also be tested. Testing in patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease is not recommended unless the patient has a history of peptic ulcer disease or dyspepsia. If a patient with gastroesophageal reflux disease is tested and found to have H. pylori infection, treatment should be offered with the acknowledgment that symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease are unlikely to improve. H. pylori infection. However, because the pretest probability of infection is higher in patients with documented peptic ulcer disease, immunoglobulin G antibody testing is acceptable in these patients. Nonendoscopic testing is an option in patients younger than 60 years with uninvestigated dyspepsia without red flags.

If endoscopy is used in patients with dyspepsia, gastric biopsies should be performed. There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation about testing and treatment in asymptomatic patients with a family history of gastric cancer or in patients with lymphocytic gastritis, hyperplastic gastric polyps, or hyperemesis gravidarum. Bismuth quadruple therapy consists of a PPI, bismuth, tetracycline, and a nitroimidazole for 10 to 14 days. It may be a particularly good option in patients with macrolide exposure or who are allergic to penicillin. Although metronidazole resistance impacts the effectiveness of this regimen, it is not nearly as profound as with clarithromycin triple therapy. Bismuth quadruple therapy should be strongly considered as first-line treatment where clarithromycin resistance is high or in patients with any previous macrolide exposure. Levofloxacin triple therapy consists of a PPI, levofloxacin, and amoxicillin for 10 to 14 days.

Levofloxacin is a fluoroquinolone with in vitro antimicrobial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including. Other suggested regimens include concomitant therapy for 10 to 14 days, rifabutin triple therapy for 10 days, and high-dose dual therapy for 14 days. Clarithromycin triple therapy is not recommended for salvage therapy.

### How to advise patients on the risk of chronic proton pump inhibitor therapy [^114yiYrC]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are widely prescribed and have excellent short-term tolerability. Administrative database studies have highlighted that many diseases are associated with PPI therapy including pneumonia, fracture, cardiovascular disease, and all-cause mortality. This review therefore reviews the evidence of the risks and benefits of these drugs.

Recent Findings

There is high-to-moderate quality evidence that PPIs are effective at treating many acid-related disorders. Recent randomized trials have suggested that the associations between PPIs and various diseases are likely to be related to bias and residual confounding and these drugs appear to be safe apart from a possible increased risk of enteric infections.

Summary

PPIs should be used at the lowest dose and for the shortest duration possible. They are still relatively well-tolerated drugs but should only be prescribed for proven indications.

### Ulcers and gastritis [^113paHsE]. Endoscopy (2005). Low credibility.

This article reviews recently published reports on ulcers and gastritis. Helicobacter pylori is known to be an important pathogen involved in gastroduodenal inflammation and peptic ulcers. Conventional endoscopy is of limited usefulness in the evaluation of gastritis, but magnifying endoscopy is evidently helpful in the diagnosis of chronic atrophic gastritis, intestinal metaplasia, and H. pylori infection. A significant reduction in the incidence of refractory ulcers and the prevalence of H. pylori infection in patients with peptic ulcer disease followed the introduction of H. pylori eradication treatment. Chronic H. pylori infection is associated with gastric cancer, and the effect of H. pylori eradication on the prevention of gastric cancer is an important issue that is still a matter of controversy. Endoscopic hemostasis and intravenous proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) infusion represent a widely accepted approach to the treatment of peptic ulcer bleeding. In clinical practice, it is important to prevent recurrent bleeding and to treat patients who do not respond to endoscopic therapy or PPI treatment. Laparoscopic repair for peptic ulcer perforations, with postoperative eradication treatment, has gradually met with acceptance in patients with H. pylori infection. H. pylori infection and its treatment continue to be interesting problems in this field.

Comment

H. pylori is a major human pathogen that causes chronic and progressive gastric mucosal damage and is aetiologically related to peptic ulcer, gastric cancer and gastric atrophy. It is also closely associated with gastric MALT lymphoma, dyspepsia, hyperplastic gastric polyps and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura. H. pylori -positive individuals are also the major reservoir for transmission of the infection.

The decision to eradicate a chronic infection in a society should be based on quantitative data regarding the outcome of untreated infections. H. pylori causes a chronic infection, similar, for example, to asymptomatic syphilis or tuberculosis, and the final outcome for any individual cannot be predicted. H. pylori infection differs from many other chronic infectious diseases because it is always transmissible, thus putting others at risk. Because the gastric damage is progressive, the lack of an obvious clinical manifestation at diagnosis has no predictive value for life-time risk to an individual patient, their family or to the community. Benefits of H. pylori eradication for an individual depend in part on the degree and extent of damage that has already occurred and the reversibility of that damage. Potential benefits of eradication include stopping the progression of mucosal damage, stabilisation or reduction in risk of developing gastric cancer, resolution of mucosal inflammation, stabilisation or improvement of gastric mucosal function, return of the normal mechanisms governing acid secretion, cure of H. pylori -related PUD, reduction in risk of gastrointestinal complications of NSAID therapy and prevention of future development of H. pylori -related peptic ulcer.

For society, the benefits include reduction of the reservoir of infected individuals capable of transmitting the infection to others, and avoidance of the costs associated with diagnosis, management and outcomes of H. pylori -related diseases that are prevented. Thus, H. pylori -infected patients should be offered eradication therapy unless there are competing considerations such as comorbidities, re-infection rates in their communities, competing health priorities of society and financial cost. It has to be remembered, however, that there are concerns about the negative impact of eradication therapies on human health, such as increase in allergy or obesity and perturbation of microbiota.

The maximum benefit of H. pylori eradication is obtained if it is done while the mucosal damage is still non-atrophic.

Use of PPIs

Coincident with PPI usage, the literature surrounding PPI safety and efficacy is growing exponentially, making it difficult to delineate an evidence-based guideline on their use. In the study by Scarpignato et al. committees on behalf of three Italian scientific societies collaborated with impressive panels of expert international reviewers to address 13 clinical scenarios in which uncertainty exists about how to prescribe PPIs and where drug misuse is common. They performed a systematic literature review inclusive of almost 500 papers and present a narrative review of the safety and appropriateness of PPI therapy in each scenario. Table 1 summarizes the key messages regarding appropriate PPI use in the 13 scenarios, organized into those appropriate for long-term or short-term PPI use, or not at all. Examining this compendium, one is immediately struck by the fact that the table includes many usages for which there are no Food and Drug Administration (FDA) indications. Apparently, the world literature provides ample evidence for the efficacy of PPIs outside of FDA indications.

There is emerging evidence that the pathogenesis of disease in laryngeal mucosa is not just related to refluxed acid, but also the presence of pepsin and acidic microenvironments. The widespread use of PPIs is also calling into question potential complications of PPI use. This commentary expands upon these issues with other potential unexpected consequences, and considers the importance of determining a proper approach to patient management.

Discussion

The global consensus meeting on H. pylori gastritis has set a new landmark for gastritis, which has continued to be an ill-conceived clinical entity placed between a histological picture and upper abdominal symptoms.

In spite of the fact that gastritis had been long recognised as an important clinical entity, generations of gastroenterologists have neglected the importance of treatment of this nosological entity. Rudolf Schindler described chronic gastritis as a serious disease and a precursor of gastric cancer and considered their relationship as being of outstanding importance in the fight against gastric cancer.

The discovery of H. pylori has revolutionised the pre-existing concepts of gastritis by assigning a specific aetiology to this entity underlying PUD and gastric cancer. The majority of these serious conditions are manifestations developed on the background of chronic gastritis caused by a unique infectious agent, H. pylori. For PUD, guidelines unanimously recommend eradication as the primary treatment for those with positive H. pylori tests. However, there has been no consensus on how and when to manage individuals with H. pylori gastritis itself, which is crucial to the efficiency of gastric cancer prevention because most patients with chronic gastritis may remain asymptomatic until the appearance of severe complications. Furthermore, both gastritis and duodenitis were recognised as important causes of upper gastrointestinal bleeding, encouraging our attention to these conditions now that anti-thrombotic therapies are increasingly being used.

To further compromise the concept of gastritis as a significant clinical entity, the term 'gastritis' has historically, but wrongly, been used as a substitute for a clinical diagnosis of FD. Historical studies, however, failed to demonstrate a significant association between histological findings of gastritis and the dyspeptic symptom complex. Hence, a potential pathogenetic role for H. pylori in causing dyspeptic symptoms was initially considered doubtful and its eradication in FD controversial. Meta-analysis of a large number of controlled trials with longer follow-up confirmed that eradication of H. pylori in patients with FD conveys a small but statistically significant benefit. Consequently, dyspepsia attributable to H. pylori gastritis involves an underlying organic cause and should be excluded from the FD category. Additionally, 'dyspeptic' patients should not automatically be labelled as having 'gastritis' without any histological confirmation.

Summary of the current evidence

PPI therapy in both uninvestigated and functional dyspepsia (FD) is widespread. Indeed, these drugs represent a key component of all the currently employed H. pylori eradication regimens. The search for and eradication of the infection is the first line therapy in the young dyspeptic patient without alarm symptoms. In those patients with persisting symptoms despite successful eradication or naïve-uninfected patients with epigastric pain syndrome (EPS), short-term 4–8 week PPI treatment should be attempted. Finally, PPI co-therapy is indicated in patients with NSAID-associated dyspepsia, also with the aim of preventing GI events.

Dyspepsia is a common GI condition seen in clinical practice. It is not a single disease, but rather a complex of symptoms referable to the upper GI tract that often overlaps with other disease entities. In front of a patient with dyspeptic complaints, physicians should carefully evaluate the history and perform a physical examination in order to assume that symptoms arise from the upper GI tract. If the patient is young (< 45 years), and there are no alarm symptoms, endoscopy and/or functional investigations are usually not performed, the condition is labeled as "uninvestigated" dyspepsia and treatment is empiric. On the contrary, if endoscopy does reveal a structural abnormality, management of dyspepsia relies on treatment of the underlying disease (e.g. PU, reflux esophagitis, or malignancy). When endoscopy is negative (which is the case in more than 70% of patients with dyspeptic symptoms), FD could be considered and, provided Rome IV criteria are fulfilled, the final diagnosis can be confirmed.

FD is characterized by a continuous or frequently recurring epigastric pain or discomfort centered in the upper abdomen for which no organic cause can be determined. According to the most updated Rome IV classification, dyspepsia is subdivided into postprandial distress syndrome (PDS, including fullness, early satiety, nausea) and epigastric pain syndrome (EPS, including epigastric pain or epigastric burning). However, symptom overlap with either GERD or irritable bowel syndrome is not infrequent.

FD is widely prevalent in the general population − up to 15% in Italy − so that FD patients are frequently managed in clinical practice by both general practitioners and gastroenterologists. Since the etiology of FD remains unclear and is probably heterogeneous, no definite single treatment is currently available for these patients. Indeed, different therapeutic approaches have been proposed.

Potential carcinogenic mechanisms of proton-pump inhibitors

Proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) have become one of the most commonly prescribed medications worldwide since their introduction in 1980s, and have been the cornerstone of the management of upper gastrointestinal diseases including peptic ulcer disease (PUD), H. pylori infection, dyspepsia, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). However, emerging data have shown that long-term PPIs are associated with a number of side effects, including bone fracture, Clostridium difficile infection, pneumonia, myocardial infarction and stroke, although a causality has not yet been confirmed.

Potent acid suppression has long been suspected a risk factor of gastric cancer by worsening gastric atrophy with ensuing hypergastrinemia and bacterial overgrowth in the stomach. Animal studies have shown that acid suppression by omeprazoleand the insurmountable histamine-2 receptor antagonist (H2RA) loxtidineinduce gastric mucosa neoplasia in rodents. However, evidence on human subjects remains controversial. Herein, we summarize the postulated mechanisms underlying the carcinogenic effects of PPIs on gastric cancer development (Figure 1).

Figure 1.
Postulated mechanisms underlying the carcinogenic effects of proton-pump inhibitors on gastric cancer development.

ECL, enterochromaffin like; H. pylori, Helicobacter pylori; PPIs, proton-pump inhibitors.

Interaction with Helicobacter pylori infection

H. pylori typically colonizes the gastric antrum, and cause an antrum-predominant gastritis in most infected subjects. Antral mucosal inflammation in turn stimulates gastric secretion, maintaining a normal- or high-acidic environment. However, when the acid production is suppressed by PPIs, the pattern of gastritis shifts to a corpus-predominant gastritis with resultant impairment of parietal cell function; a phenomenon that does not occur in H. pylori -negative patients. As such, the acid-suppressive effect of PPIs is further enhanced by H. pylori- induced corpus gastritis. In a cohort study of 177 patients, atrophic gastritis only developed in H. pylori -infected but not H. pylori -negative patients with long-term PPI use during a mean follow up of 5 years. A systematic review also showed that the risk of corpus atrophy was more pronounced in H. pylori -infected than H. pylori -negative PPI users [odds ratio (OR) 11.45; 95% CI: 6.25–20.99].

Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) continues to be among the most common diseases seen by gastroenterologists, surgeons, and primary care physicians. Our understanding of the varied presentations of GERD, enhancements in diagnostic testing, and approach to patient management have evolved. During this time, scrutiny of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) has increased considerably. Although PPIs remain the medical treatment of choice for GERD, multiple publications have raised questions about adverse events, raising doubts about the safety of long-term use and increasing concern about overprescribing of PPIs. New data regarding the potential for surgical and endoscopic interventions have emerged. In this new document, we provide updated, evidence-based recommendations and practical guidance for the evaluation and management of GERD, including pharmacologic, lifestyle, surgical, and endoscopic management. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation system was used to evaluate the evidence and the strength of recommendations. Key concepts and suggestions that as of this writing do not have sufficient evidence to grade are also provided.

### Insights into the evaluation and management of dyspepsia: recent developments and new guidelines [^112qtUxp]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

The ACG/CAG guideline updated a previous Cochrane Collaboration systematic review and meta-analysiscomparing H. pylori test and treat with prompt upper GI endoscopy for the management of dyspepsia. This pooled data from six randomised controlled trials (RCTs), involving 2399 patients with uninvestigated dyspepsia. There was no difference in global dyspepsia symptoms between groups [relative risk (RR) of remaining dyspeptic 0.94 (95% CI 0.84–1.04)], but only 25% of patients in the test and treat arms of the trials underwent an upper GI endoscopy over a 12-month period, in contrast with nearly all of the patients in the prompt upper GI endoscopy arms. The test and treat strategy was therefore associated with significant cost savings over endoscopic investigation. In terms of other management strategies for uninvestigated dyspepsia, analysis of data from four RCTs investigating test and treat versus empirical PPI therapy found no statistically significant difference between these two approaches (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.77–1.04). Nonetheless, on the basis of a trend towards test and treat for both cost and clinical benefit from a previous individual patient data meta-analysis, this was the preferred first-line approach, with empirical PPI recommended for H. pylori -negative individuals, or those in whom eradication therapy was not of symptomatic benefit.

2 blockers and titrates to symptom control. Step-down therapy starts with once- or twice-daily PPI therapy and decreases the dosage or changes to the lowest form of acid suppression that will control the patient's symptoms. 14 In considering which approach would be best for a patient, the physician should consider that PPIs have been shown to be more effective and quicker to eliminate symptoms and heal esophagitis than H 2 blockers. 2, 14 Thus, the duration of symptoms, rather than the symptom complex or type of treatment, is a more important consideration in determining the need for an endoscopic evaluation to rule out Barrett's esophagus. 14, 15 While most patients with typical symptoms of GERD responsive to empiric therapy do not require endoscopy, patient whose symptoms do not respond to PPI therapy most likely do not have GERD, and further evaluation of their symptoms is needed. 14, 15.

PEPTIC ULCERS Peptic ulcers usually occur in patients with normal acid secretion and gastroduodenal mucosal defenses disrupted because of. Helicobacter pylori infection or therapy with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Studies of PPIs have demonstrated superior healing rates, shorter healing time, and faster symptom relief than are obtained withH 2 blockers in these patients. 2–4 PPIs have been shown to heal peptic ulcers that may be refractory even to high-dose H 2-receptor blockers, and they also exhibit antimicrobial activity against H. pylori in vitro. While the mechanism of this antimicrobial activity is unclear, it is probably related to inhibition of the urease enzyme produced by H. pylori. PPIs only suppress H. pylori in vivo, and antibiotics alone are ineffective in eradicating H. pylori. A combination of adequate acid suppression and antibiotic therapy is necessary for the successful eradication of H. pylori.

2–4 The recurrence rate of peptic ulcers after one year is less than 10 percent when the combination of a PPI and antibiotics is used for H. pylori eradication. 2, 6. NSAID–INDUCED GASTROPATHY NSAIDs cause peptic ulcers by inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis and weakening gastroduodenal mucosal defenses.
