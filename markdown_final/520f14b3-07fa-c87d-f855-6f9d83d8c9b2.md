## Question

How does a shift to the left in the CBC relate to the severity of infection?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how a left shift in the CBC relates to the severity of infection. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining what constitutes a left shift and how it is measured. Then, I should verify the pathophysiologic basis linking left shift to infection severity. Next, I will examine the diagnostic and prognostic value across clinical contexts, including ED, ICU, pediatrics, and COVID-19. After that, I need to compare the performance of left shift with other biomarkers and consider confounders and limitations. Finally, I will synthesize practical clinical implications and a cautious, reference-aware conclusion.

> Let me first confirm the definition so I don't misinterpret the data. A left shift refers to an increase in immature neutrophils in the peripheral blood, classically bands, but also metamyelocytes and earlier myeloid precursors; it can be quantified as a band percentage, an immature-to-total neutrophil ratio, or an absolute immature granulocyte count, and modern automated differentials report an immature granulocyte percentage that correlates with manual band counts, which I should keep in mind when comparing studies [^df4a7657] [^e095a6cf].

> Now, I need to check the pathophysiology to ensure the mechanistic link makes sense. Severe infection triggers emergency granulopoiesis and premature release of myeloid cells from the marrow, so the magnitude of left shift tends to track with the intensity of the host inflammatory response; this is why left shift has long been described as proportional to the severity of toxemia in acute bacterial infection, and why it appears alongside other toxic changes like Döhle bodies and toxic granulation in more severe disease [^6b6a78bf] [^ea9787cd].

> Next, I should review the diagnostic value in general adult ED populations. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I initially thought bands alone might be highly specific, but wait, I should verify the actual test characteristics. A large ED cohort showed that even modest band elevations correlate with bloodstream infection and mortality, with a stepwise increase in BSI risk from 0% to > 10% bands, and mortality rising in parallel; combining WBC and left shift improves specificity for serious bacterial infection, though sensitivity remains imperfect, reinforcing that left shift should augment, not replace, clinical judgment [^12356a51] [^e095a6cf].

> I will now examine ICU and critical care data, where severity gradients are more pronounced. Studies in septic shock and critical illness show that elevated immature neutrophil levels track with disease severity, DIC, and mortality; the delta neutrophil index, a surrogate of immature granulocytes, independently predicts mortality in septic AKI, and the intensive care infection score, which incorporates myeloid left shift among innate immune parameters, performs comparably to CRP and PCT for predicting infection in the critically ill, supporting the notion that left shift reflects systemic innate activation in severe infection [^871cc9f9] [^76039750].

> Let me consider pediatrics, where age-specific nuances matter. In children with suspected appendicitis, a left shift substantially increases the likelihood of disease; combining elevated WBC with left shift yields a positive likelihood ratio around 9.8, while left shift alone has an LR+ near 5.9, which is clinically meaningful in triage. However, in neonates and young infants, extreme I/T ratios or very low WBC/ANC carry the highest likelihood for early-onset sepsis, yet overall diagnostic performance of CBC components is modest, so I should be cautious about overinterpreting a left shift in this age group without corroborating clinical and inflammatory markers [^cf4c1eda] [^a67df3e0] [^b9e39058].

> But wait, what if the infection is viral or atypical; does left shift still track severity? In COVID-19, severe disease is associated with neutrophilia and a myeloid left shift, and morphologic abnormalities like pseudo–Pelger-Huët neutrophils and toxic changes correlate with worse outcomes; serial CBC with manual differential has been recommended to monitor progression, indicating that left shift and toxic morphology can signal deterioration even in viral sepsis phenotypes, albeit alongside other markers such as NLR and RDW [^321c8184] [^09c582d5] [^ea9787cd].

> I should double-check how left shift compares with other biomarkers so I don't overstate its standalone utility. Systematic reviews in febrile children show that CRP and procalcitonin outperform WBC indices, including band counts, for ruling in serious bacterial infection, whereas WBC metrics have limited or no value for ruling out disease; similarly, in elder ED patients, PCT outperforms WBC with or without left shift for bacteremia, reinforcing that left shift should be integrated with CRP/PCT, lactate, and clinical scores rather than used in isolation [^04c8d046] [^29d60349].

> Hold on, I should verify confounders that can mimic or blunt a left shift. Corticosteroids, G-CSF, and stress responses can cause neutrophilia with a left shift in the absence of infection, while congenital or acquired Pelger-Huët anomaly can artifactually elevate band counts; conversely, immunocompromised hosts may have blunted left shifts despite severe infection, so a normal or absent left shift does not exclude sepsis, and clinical context must guide interpretation [^3a2bde2a] [^38d03ba5] [^c3c0ca63].

> Let me synthesize the relationship to infection severity. The weight of evidence supports that a left shift reflects the intensity of innate immune activation and correlates with greater likelihood and severity of bacterial infection, higher risks of bacteremia, organ dysfunction, and mortality; however, it lacks the specificity of CRP or PCT and performs best when combined with other clinical and laboratory data, particularly in ICU, ED, and select pediatric contexts where severity gradients are more pronounced [^12356a51] [^871cc9f9] [^04c8d046].

> I need to ensure the practical implications are clear. In patients with suspected infection, the presence of a left shift should raise suspicion for bacterial infection and prompt consideration of blood cultures, source control, and timely antibiotics when indicated; conversely, absence of a left shift does not exclude infection, especially in immunocompromised hosts or early presentations, so clinicians should integrate left shift with CRP/PCT, lactate, vital signs, and organ dysfunction assessment rather than relying on it in isolation [^6b385811] [^9927b726] [^3c91f00a].

> In conclusion, I should confirm the bottom line. A left shift signals increased marrow release of immature neutrophils and generally tracks with infection severity, particularly in bacterial disease and in critical illness, but it is a nonspecific marker with modest standalone diagnostic performance; when combined with clinical assessment and superior biomarkers like CRP and PCT, left shift meaningfully informs risk stratification and management decisions, whereas isolated interpretation risks both overcalling and missing serious infection [^12356a51] [^04c8d046] [^871cc9f9].

A left shift on CBC reflects **increased immature neutrophils** (bands, metamyelocytes, myelocytes) in the blood, indicating a robust innate immune response to infection [^6b6a78bf]. The magnitude of the left shift correlates with infection severity: higher immature neutrophil counts are linked to **greater severity**, higher risks of bacteremia, sepsis, and mortality [^12356a51] [^871cc9f9]. However, a left shift is **nonspecific** and can occur with noninfectious inflammation, corticosteroids, or marrow stress; thus, it should be interpreted with clinical context and other markers (e.g. CRP, procalcitonin) [^3a2bde2a] [^04c8d046]. In children, an immature-to-total neutrophil ratio > 0.2 is a strong predictor of serious bacterial infection, whereas in adults, even modest band elevations increase the risk of bloodstream infection and death [^d8aa0909] [^12356a51].

---

## Definition and pathophysiology

A left shift is defined by an **increase in immature neutrophils** — bands, metamyelocytes, and myelocytes — in the peripheral blood, reflecting accelerated granulopoiesis and premature release from the bone marrow [^6b6a78bf]. This response is typically triggered by bacterial infections, which stimulate cytokine-driven marrow activation [^6b6a78bf].

---

## Clinical significance of left shift

The presence and magnitude of a left shift are **strongly associated with infection severity**, including:

- **Bacteremia and sepsis**: Higher band counts correlate with increased likelihood of bloodstream infection and sepsis [^12356a51] [^871cc9f9].
- **Mortality**: Elevated band counts are independently associated with higher in-hospital mortality, even at levels below the traditional 10% threshold [^12356a51] [^99a4f2fd].
- **Organ dysfunction**: Left shift correlates with systemic inflammatory response and organ failure, particularly in critical illness [^871cc9f9] [^b882bb47].

---

## Quantitative assessment of left shift

Several parameters quantify the left shift, including:

| **Parameter** | **Definition** | **Clinical significance** |
|-|-|-|
| Band count (%) | Percentage of band neutrophils | - Strong predictor of bacteremia and mortality [^12356a51] [^99a4f2fd] |
| Immature-to-total neutrophil ratio (I/T ratio) | Ratio of immature to total neutrophils | - Highly predictive of serious bacterial infection in children [^d8aa0909] |
| Absolute immature granulocyte count (IG count) | Absolute count of immature granulocytes | - Useful for early detection of sepsis and infection severity [^871cc9f9] |

---

## Clinical evidence linking left shift to infection severity

Multiple studies demonstrate a **dose-response relationship** between left shift and infection severity:

- **Emergency department studies**: Even modest elevations in band counts (1–2%) significantly increase the risk of bloodstream infection and mortality, with risk rising progressively as band counts increase [^12356a51].
- **Pediatric studies**: An I/T ratio > 0.2 is a strong predictor of serious bacterial infection in febrile infants, outperforming other CBC parameters [^d8aa0909].
- **Critical care studies**: Elevated immature granulocyte counts are independently associated with mortality in septic patients, including those with acute kidney injury requiring continuous renal replacement therapy [^871cc9f9].

---

## Limitations and confounding factors

While a left shift is a useful marker, it is **nonspecific** and may be influenced by:

- **Noninfectious inflammation**: Conditions such as trauma, surgery, and autoimmune diseases can cause a left shift [^notfound].
- **Medications**: Corticosteroids and growth factors (e.g. G-CSF) can induce a left shift [^3a2bde2a].
- **Hematologic disorders**: Leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes can mimic a left shift [^e624aa06].

Therefore, **clinical context and corroborative tests** (e.g. CRP, procalcitonin) are essential for accurate interpretation [^04c8d046].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines emphasize integrating left shift with **clinical assessment and other biomarkers**. The Surviving Sepsis Campaign recommends rapid assessment of infection likelihood using clinical evaluation and laboratory tests, including CBC with differential, lactate, and procalcitonin [^6b385811]. Pediatric guidelines similarly advise using CBC with differential alongside inflammatory markers (CRP, procalcitonin) for risk stratification [^6d374f76].

---

## Practical clinical implications

Clinicians should consider the following when interpreting a left shift:

- **Magnitude matters**: Higher immature neutrophil counts indicate greater severity and higher risk of complications [^12356a51].
- **Context is crucial**: Always interpret left shift within the clinical context and alongside other laboratory findings [^04c8d046].
- **Serial monitoring**: Trends in left shift parameters can provide valuable information on disease progression or response to therapy [^e61e989e].

---

A left shift on CBC reflects increased immature neutrophils and correlates with **infection severity**, including higher risks of bacteremia, sepsis, and mortality. It is a **nonspecific** marker and should be interpreted with clinical context and other biomarkers to guide management.

### White blood cell left shift in a neonate: a case of mistaken identity [^38d03ba5]. Journal of Perinatology (2006). Low credibility.

We present a full-term male infant who presented with tachypnea and an increased band count on his complete blood count (CBC) with an immature to total neutrophil (I:T) ratio of 0.6 raising suspicion of early onset sepsis. A blood culture was drawn and he was started on appropriate antibiotics. The patient's clinical condition rapidly improved; however, the white cell count 'left shift' persisted. When a detailed family history was obtained, it was discovered that the father, paternal uncle and the grandfather had been diagnosed with Pelger-Huet anomaly (PHA). As the urine, blood and CSF cultures were all negative in this now well-appearing infant, the left shift on the CBC was believed to be due to inheritance of the PHA. We present this case to emphasize that even in this age of sophisticated laboratory evaluation, a good clinical history, including family history, and clinical evaluation, are essential for accurate diagnosis.

### Comparison of hematologic abnormalities between hospitalized coronavirus disease 2019 positive and negative patients with correlation to disease severity and outcome [^321c8184]. Journal of Medical Virology (2022). Medium credibility.

Peripheral blood smear (PBS) changes in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are diverse and have been reported in the literature in the form of case series with relatively smaller sample sizes and with a handful of studies showing the association between PBS and clinical severity. This study aims to highlight the numerical and morphological changes in peripheral blood of COVID-19 patients and to compare the same in intensive care unit (ICU) and non-ICU settings as well as with disease severity and outcome. The study included 80 COVID-19 positive (41 ICU and 39 non-ICU) patients and 32 COVID-19 negative ICU patients. Complete blood counts (CBCs) and PBS findings were studied and scored by two pathologists blindfolded. Absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) and absolute eosinophil count (AEC) were significantly lower in COVID-19 positive cases as compared to the COVID-19 negative group (p=0.001 and p=0.001). COVID-19 positive group showed significant left myeloid shift (p=0.021), Dohle bodies (p=0.025) with significant prominence of acquired pseudo-Pelger-Huët anomaly, ring-shaped neutrophils, monolobate neutrophils, and plasmacytoid lymphocytes as compared to control group (p=0.000, p=0.009, p=0.046, and p=0.011, respectively). The overall mean white blood cell (WBC) counts were higher in COVID-19 positive ICU patients as compared to non-ICU COVID patients with significant shift to left, presence of ring-shaped neutrophils, monocyte vacuolation, and large granular lymphocytes (p=0.017, p=0.007, p=0.008, and p=0.004, respectively). Deceased group showed significantly higher WBC count (p=0.018) with marked neutrophilia (p=0.024) and toxic granulation (p=0.01) with prominence of monocyte vacuolization, ring-shaped neutrophils, large granular lymphocytes, and reactive lymphocytes. Parameters like myeloid left shift, ring-shaped neutrophils, monocyte vacuolation, and large granular lymphocytes emerged as highly sensitive markers of disease severity. Therefore, serial CBC with comprehensive PBS analysis should be done in every newly diagnosed hospitalized COVID-19 patient which potentially predicts the course of the disease.

### Comparing automated vs manual leukocyte differential counts for quantifying the 'left shift' in the blood of neonates [^df4a7657]. Journal of Perinatology (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

The neutrophil 'left shift' can be measured via the immature to total (I/T) neutrophil ratio or the absolute bands per μl using a manual differential count. It can also be measured from an automated differential count by the immature granulocyte percentage (IG%) or the absolute IG per μl. In neonates, it is unknown if the manual or automated differential count is superior.

Study Design

We directly compared complete blood counts (CBCs) with manual and automated differential counts from infants <90 days old, and documented whether or not each neonate was infected. We developed reference intervals for I/T ratio, bands per μl, IG% and IG per μl using values from non-infected neonates.

Results

The database had 10714 CBCs. The upper reference interval for I/T ratio was 0.29 in the first 48h and 0.31 thereafter; bands per μl was 3710μl(-1) in the first 48h and 1785μl(-1) thereafter. IG% was 6.2% then 4.2%; IG per μl was 1460μl(-1) then 613μl(-1). Statistical performances of the four methods were equivalent for identifying infection.

Conclusions

We developed reference intervals for four methods of quantifying a neonate's 'left shift'. The information from automated differentials is not inferior to that from manual differentials in identifying infections, but automated differentials have the advantages of a larger sample size, being less expensive, and faster performance times.

### The diagnostic and prognostic significance of monitoring blood levels of immature neutrophils in patients with systemic inflammation [^b882bb47]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

It is of interest that one of the criteria for SIRS involves the appearance in the circulation of immature neutrophils, whose mature forms are essential for the elimination of foreign bacteria but whose untoward activities could lead to organ failure. The appearance of band cells in the blood of patients with bacterial infections is commonly referred to as ‘a shift to the left’. Because SIRS is often initiated by infections, 90% of which are bacterial in origin, there is the question whether, in the intensive care unit (ICU) setting, elevated levels of circulating band cells are associated predominantly with N-I SIRS or with sepsis. We therefore investigated the relative merits of the WBC criteria of Bone et al. and of Levy et al. in identifying patients with SIRS and whether monitoring levels of all forms of immature neutrophils could help in differentiating patients with N-I SIRS from those with sepsis. It was recently shown in patients with septic shock that increased mortality was related to WBC counts and that in patients with sepsis an increase in the number of immature neutrophils reflected disease severity and predicted patient deterioration. On this basis, we also examined whether levels of immature neutrophils had a bearing on patient outcome.

### Diagnostic value of laboratory tests in identifying serious infections in febrile children: systematic review [^04c8d046]. BMJ (2011). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To collate all available evidence on the diagnostic value of laboratory tests for the diagnosis of serious infections in febrile children in ambulatory settings.

Design

Systematic review.

Data Sources

Electronic databases, reference tracking, and consultation with experts.

Study Selection

Studies were selected on six criteria: design (studies of diagnostic accuracy or deriving prediction rules), participants (otherwise healthy children and adolescents aged 1 month to 18 years), setting (first contact ambulatory care), outcome (serious infection), features assessed (in first contact care), and data reported (sufficient to construct a 2×2 table).

Data Extraction

Quality assessment was based on the quality assessment tool of diagnostic accuracy studies (QUADAS) criteria. Meta-analyses were done using the bivariate random effects method and hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic curves for studies with multiple thresholds.

Data Synthesis

None of the 14 studies identified were of high methodological quality and all were carried out in an emergency department or paediatric assessment unit. The prevalence of serious infections ranged from 4.5% to 29.3%. Tests were carried out for C reactive protein (five studies), procalcitonin (three), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (one), interleukins (two), white blood cell count (seven), absolute neutrophil count (two), band count (three), and left shift (one). The tests providing most diagnostic value were C reactive protein and procalcitonin. Bivariate random effects meta-analysis (five studies, 1379 children) for C reactive protein yielded a pooled positive likelihood ratio of 3.15 (95% confidence interval 2.67 to 3.71) and a pooled negative likelihood ratio of 0.33 (0.22 to 0.49). To rule in serious infection, cut-off levels of 2 ng/mL for procalcitonin (two studies, positive likelihood ratio 13.7, 7.4 to 25.3 and 3.6, 1.4 to 8.9) and 80 mg/L for C reactive protein (one study, positive likelihood ratio 8.4, 5.1 to 14.1) are recommended; lower cut-off values of 0.5 ng/mL for procalcitonin or 20 mg/L for C reactive protein are necessary to rule out serious infection. White blood cell indicators are less valuable than inflammatory markers for ruling in serious infection (positive likelihood ratio 0.87-2.43), and have no value for ruling out serious infection (negative likelihood ratio 0.61-1.14). The best performing clinical decision rule (recently validated in an independent dataset) combines testing for C reactive protein, procalcitonin, and urinalysis and has a positive likelihood ratio of 4.92 (3.26 to 7.43) and a negative likelihood ratio of 0.07 (0.02 to 0.27).

Conclusion

Measuring inflammatory markers in an emergency department setting can be diagnostically useful, but clinicians should apply different cut-off values depending on whether they are trying to rule in or rule out serious infection. Measuring white blood cell count is less useful for ruling in serious infection and not useful for ruling out serious infection. More rigorous studies are needed, including studies in primary care, to assess the value of laboratory tests alongside clinical diagnostic measurements, including vital signs.

### Clinical significance of CBC and WBC morphology in the diagnosis and clinical course of COVID-19 infection [^09c582d5]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To investigate the clinical significance of numeric and morphologic peripheral blood (PB) changes in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-positive patients in predicting the outcome, as well as to compare these changes between critically ill COVID-19-positive and COVID-19-negative patients.

Methods

The study included 90 COVID-19-positive (51 intensive care unit [ICU] and 39 non-ICU) patients and 30 COVID-19-negative ICU patients. We collected CBC parameters (both standard and research) and PB morphologic findings, which were independently scored by two hematopathologists.

Results

All patients with COVID-19 demonstrated striking numeric and morphologic WBC changes, which were different between mild and severe disease states. More severe disease was associated with significant neutrophilia and lymphopenia, which was intensified in critically ill patients. Abnormal WBC morphology, most pronounced in monocytes and lymphocytes, was associated with more mild disease; the changes were lost with disease progression. Between COVID-19-positive and COVID-19-negative ICU patients, significant differences in morphology-associated research parameters were indicative of changes due to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 virus, including higher RNA content in monocytes, lower RNA content in lymphocytes, and smaller hypogranular neutrophils.

Conclusions

Hospitalized patients with COVID-19 should undergo a comprehensive daily CBC with manual WBC differential to monitor for numerical and morphologic changes predictive of poor outcome and signs of disease progression.

### Neutrophil CD64 is an improved indicator of infection or sepsis in emergency department patients [^cd9648d5]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Context

Sepsis, affecting millions of individuals annually with an associated high mortality rate, is among the top 10 causes of death. In addition, improvements in diagnostic tests for detecting and monitoring sepsis and infection have been limited in the last 25 years. Neutrophil CD64 expression has been proposed as an improved diagnostic test for the evaluation of infection and sepsis.

Objective

To evaluate the diagnostic performance of a quantitative flow cytometric assay for leukocyte CD64 expression in comparison with the standard tests for infection/sepsis in an ambulatory care setting.

Design

Prospective analysis of 100 blood samples from patients from an emergency department setting in a 965-bed tertiary care suburban community hospital was performed for neutrophil CD64 expression, C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and complete blood count. The laboratory findings were compared with a clinical score for the likelihood of infection/sepsis, which was obtained by a blinded retrospective chart review.

Results

The diagnostic performance, as gauged by the clinical score, varied with neutrophil CD64 (sensitivity 87.9%, specificity 71.2%, efficiency 76.8%) and outperformed C-reactive protein (sensitivity 88.2%, specificity 59.4%, efficiency 69.4%), absolute neutrophil count (sensitivity 60.0%, specificity 50.8%, efficiency 53.8%), myeloid left shift (sensitivity 68.2%, specificity 76.3%, efficiency 73.3%), and sedimentation rate (sensitivity 50.0%, specificity 65.5%, efficiency 61.0%).

Conclusion

Neutrophil CD64 expression quantitation provides improved diagnostic detection of infection/sepsis compared with the standard diagnostic tests used in current medical practice.

### The late phase of sepsis is characterized by an increased microbiological burden and death rate [^497e8c01]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

In this retrospective review, we attempt to explore the clinically impacted and microbiological pattern of the late phase of sepsis as a cause of late morbidity and mortality by dividing sepsis, according to the observed mortality peaks, into three periods. We detected a significant increase of positive blood cultures drawn in patients with sepsis at a later time point with higher rates of TOB, which may indicate an anergic immune system. It needs to be understood that such implications have a number of important drawbacks due to the design of this study. First, the demonstrated higher frequency rate of positive cultures will be very sensitive to existing practice patterns. In our ICU the decision to draw cultures will be taken according to the guidelines recommending a sampling by signs and symptoms of infections as a new onset of fever, chills, hypothermia, leukocytosis, PCT (demonstrated by the high levels in bc +/- patients at the sampling day) or a raise in CRP, neutropenia or left shift in differential blood count. In our opinion, sampling based on guidelines without a prospective investigative protocol reflects the situation on ICU more reliably. The sampling rate clearly shows a drop from 88.3% in phase I to 52% in phase II and a rise up to 66.2% in phase III. This might demonstrate the still ongoing inflammatory response in these patients, especially after phase I and II in which almost all of our patients had already received guideline-appropriate antibiotic treatment. In contrast to the early phase, in which well described guidelines for the sampling indication and procedure exist, the indication for blood culture sampling during the late time points are often also determined by the clinical phenotype and may not be as precisely captured when compared to the onset phase. This fact represents a confounder which is very difficult to control. Within this study, we used a definition of TOB. However, a precise definition of TOB does not exist, and it must be pointed out that our classification was based on data from the literature and the expert opinion of microbiologists and intensive care physicians, which may also represent a drawback with respect to derived implications. A further limitation of this study might be that there is important informative censoring going on; patients who die early contribute to the initial blood culture sampling quota but obviously not to the later ones. In contrast, patients who did well and left the ICU and were sampled later were still included in our analyses. Patients who did well and left the hospital were not observed further. However, all three scenarios provoke no bias for the rate of positive blood cultures. Also limiting might be the fact that the number and the duration of uses of a central venous catheter were not included in our analyses. Only the requirement of mechanical ventilation and renal replacement therapy as additional risk factors for infections were analyzed in greater detail. This study shows that patients with sepsis treated on our ICU at a later time point (>16 days) were still or even more likely to exhibit a positive blood culture in comparison to earlier time points and that such patients are more prone to develop TOBs. Of course, these results are not necessarily a legitimate or validated proxy for an anergic immune system, but due to the absence of a clinically established and relevant indicator for immune suppression in daily practices, the data might serve as further hints for this hypothesis, which has been much more clearly described in models of experimental sepsis.

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the evaluation and management of emergency department patients with suspected appendicitis: approved by ACEP board of directors February 1, 2023 [^7e896427]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Appendicitis laboratory testing in children (Wang et al., 2007)—a retrospective diagnostic study evaluating white blood cell (WBC) count and left shift for acute appendicitis with the criterion standard “not stated under methods”—reported in 104 children a disease prevalence of 10.2%; high WBC count and left shift yielded sensitivity 59% and specificity 94% with LR+ 9.8 and LR- 0.44, and using either elevated WBC count or left shift showed sensitivity 79% with LR+ 3.9 and LR- 0.26; limitations included that the criterion standard was not stated and generalizability concerns.

### Chronic myeloid leukaemia: ESMO clinical practice guidelines for diagnosis, treatment and follow-up [^e624aa06]. Annals of Oncology (2017). Medium credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for chronic myeloid leukemia, more specifically with respect to diagnostic blood tests, ESMO 2017 guidelines recommend to recognize that the diagnosis in most cases can be made on the basis of a characteristic blood count and differential (excessive granulocytosis with a typical left shift of granulopoiesis).

### Association of full blood count findings with risk of mortality in children with Klebsiella pneumoniae bloodstream infection at a South African children's hospital [^5dfb69e7]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

KPBSI has been reported to cause a leucocytosis, with a predominant left-sided shift. In a Korean study involving 3 862 infants, 45 cases of early-onset sepsis were described. Group B Streptococcus caused 22% (n = 10) of cases and Escherichia coli caused 20% (n = 9 cases). The overall mortality was 38% (17/45). Odds ratios adjusted (aOR) for confounders were used to show that Gram-negative sepsis, neutropenia and inactivity were associated with fatality, aOR 42 (95% CI 1.4-1281.8), aOR 46 (95% CI 1.3-1628.7) and aOR 34 (95% CI 1.8-633.4) respectively. The mechanisms of how KP infection affects the platelets, band cells and white cells are not fully understood. Specifically, data on how KPBSI affects the haematological cell lines in children are limited, however the effect of sepsis causing disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) has been well described. However, it is postulated that multifactorial components including the depletion of antibodies, the enhanced coagulation, the increased proinflammatory cytokine levels could explain the some of the abnormalities seen in the FBC with KP bloodstream infection. There is some data from a study from Turkey where 62 of 5 535 hospitalised children, with median age 4 years, who were diagnosed with acute DIC were studied. Infection was the cause of the DIC in 59 (95%) children, and severe injury the cause in the other 3 (5%). The infecting pathogens were identified as Neisseria meningitidis in four children, Gram-negative pathogens in ten and Gram-positive pathogens in six children. The haematological findings described by this study included FBC counts, prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time APTT), International normalised ratio (INR), fibrinogen and D-dimers. None of the laboratory findings played a predictive role for mortality; specifically, there was no difference in the platelet counts or white cell counts in survivors compared to those who died, p value 0.629 and 0.046 respectively. Of these 62 children, 35 (56%) died including 8 of the 10 children with Gram-negative infection. Multiorgan dysfunction syndrome and acute cardiorespiratory dysfunction were the factors significantly associated with mortality in their multivariate analysis. In contrast, our study demonstrated that if thrombocytopenia among other markers does not recover after therapeutic interventions, particularly if platelet counts remain persistently low at day 5–14 of therapy, the risk of mortality is significantly higher.

### Laboratory diagnosis of sepsis? No SIRS, not just yet [^b545ff21]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2015). Low credibility.

In order to maximize the benefit of prompt antimicrobial therapy and avoid the risk associated with inappropriate use of antimicrobial agents, patients with suspected sepsis must be rapidly differentiated from patients with systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). In combination with standard microbiological testing, a number of biomarkers have been recently evaluated for this purpose, and the performance characteristics of the most promising of these are reviewed.

### Guidelines for prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in HIV-infected adults and adolescents: recommendations from CDC, the National Institutes of Health, and the Hiv Medicine Association of the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^0b469e7f]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Clinical manifestations of bacterial CAP in HIV—presentation, examination, and hospitalization threshold—are generally similar to those in individuals without HIV, with acute symptom onset over 3–5 days typical for S. pneumoniae or Haemophilus infections. Indicators of sepsis include fever, tachycardia, and/or hypotension, and tachypnea with decreased arterial oxygen saturation indicates moderate-to-severe pneumonia for which clinicians should strongly consider hospitalizing the patient. Bacterial pneumonia commonly shows focal consolidation signs on exam, whereas Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) often has a normal lung exam or inspiratory crackles if abnormal; white blood cell count is usually elevated (often relative to baseline in advanced HIV) with possible neutrophilia or left shift. On chest radiograph, bacterial pneumonia characteristically produces unilateral, focal, segmental, or lobar consolidation; consolidation is typical with S. pneumoniae or Haemophilus, whereas cavitation may suggest P. aeruginosa or S. aureus.

### Isolated elevated blood neutrophil concentration at altitude does not require NICU admission if appropriate reference ranges are used [^36c3c520]. Journal of Perinatology (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

The Intermountain Healthcare hospitals use a clinical pathway algorithm for early-onset infection, which is based on the 2002 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines for perinatal group B streptococcal disease. As part of this pathway, neonates in the well baby nursery, who seem to be well but have risk factors for infection, receive a 'limited laboratory evaluation including a CBC', and if the complete blood cell count (CBC) is abnormal, antibiotic treatment and neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) monitoring are initiated. We recently found that reference ranges for absolute neutrophil counts (ANCs) are much wider at our altitude (4800 to 5000 ft) than at sea level. On this basis, we speculated that some well babies with risk factors for infection are mistakenly judged as having an abnormal CBC, and are unnecessarily admitted to the NICU.

Study Design

This was a retrospective observational cohort study of neonates of >37 weeks gestation admitted to either of two Intermountain Healthcare NICUs for intravenous antibiotic treatment during a recent 36-month period.

Results

During the study period 3217 patients were admitted to the two NICUs, 1049 (32.6%) of which were born at>37 weeks gestation. Of these, 14 (1.3%) were found to have been admitted to the NICU on the basis of an abnormal CBC (elevated ANC), when in retrospect, using the appropriate ANC chart, their CBCs were completely normal. None of the 14 neonates had a leukocyte left shift (immature to total neutrophil ratio >0.3) or thrombocytopenia. None were treated with supplemental oxygen or mechanical ventilation in the NICU. All 14 had sterile blood cultures. All had antibiotics stopped in 48 to 72 h, and all were discharged home as well babies.

Conclusion

We identified 14 neonates who, while in the well baby nursery, were found to have risk factors for early-onset infection, but did not seem to be infected, and were subsequently admitted to a NICU for intravenous antibiotic treatment and monitoring under the mistaken impression that they had an abnormal CBC. We maintain that use of an appropriate neutrophil reference range chart can reduce NICU admissions and can limit unnecessary antibiotic exposure.

### Procalcitonin and other markers of infection. what should be their role in clinical practice? [^7720287d]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2002). Low credibility.

Clinicians are always faced with a decision when confronted with a febrile patient; they must decide between what is an infectious condition and what is not, and between what merits hospital observation, what requires empirical antibiotic treatment and what needs outpatient follow-up. In this respect, judgement based on medical history and physical examination outweigh the predictive value of various laboratory markers of infection, as the latter generally reflect a nonspecific reaction of the host to widely different infectious and inflammatory stimuli. In the evaluation of specific subgroups of patients, e.g. those in the intensive care unit, laboratory tests should also preferably form a continuum with medical history and physical examination, aimed at clarifying host condition, the setting and the source of a possible infection.

### Age-related prevalence and clinical significance of neutropenia-isolated or combined with other cytopenias: real world data from 373 820 primary care individuals [^3f4a16b3]. American Journal of Hematology (2020). Medium credibility.

Neutropenia (NP), that is, an absolute blood neutrophil count (ANC) <1.5g/L, accompanies various diseases. However, the clinical significance of NP, detected in routine complete blood cell counts (CBC) in primary care, is poorly characterized. Here, from a primary care resource with ANCs from >370000 individuals, we identified and followed neutropenic subjects for the next 4years for novel ICD-10 based diagnoses of viral infections and hematological malignancies (ie, previously identified major outcomes in NP individuals) in Danish nationwide health registers. Risk estimates were assessed for children/adolescents (1-18years) and adults (19-90years) in relation to NP severity, and for isolated NP, bi- or pancytopenias. We found that NP was observed in 4.9% of children and in 1.9% of adults. The lower the ANC, the likelier was a diagnosis of viral infections or hematological malignancies established during the ensuing 4years. Among neutropenic children, unspecified viral infections predominated, followed by mononucleosis (with other cytopenias in only 7% and 25% of the cases, respectively). All NP children with acute leukemia presented with bi- or pancytopenia from start of follow-up. In NP adults, hepatitis, followed by HIV, were the most common infections, and acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs) the predominating hematological malignancies. Adult NP patients, subsequently diagnosed with hepatitis, HIV or AML, MDS, were bi- or pancytopenic in 42%, 47%, 90% and 91% of cases, respectively. Thus, presence of NP in even one CBC may be the first sign of a latent viral or hematological disorder requiring careful follow-up.

### Delta neutrophil index is an independent predictor of mortality in septic acute kidney injury patients treated with continuous renal replacement therapy [^871cc9f9]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

This study demonstrated that DNI value is closely related to severity of disease in patients with S-AKI. In addition, baseline DNI level is independently associated with mortality in S-AKI patients treated with CRRT, even after adjusting for other established prognostic variables such as SOFA score.

DNI is the difference between the leukocyte differential assayed in the MPO channel and that measured in the nuclear lobularity channel, and was initially designed as a reliable and reproducible method to reflect IGs in circulating blood. The shift to the left of neutrophils, which reflects elevated IGs, has been characterized in sepsis and SIRS. Leukocyte count could be variable according to severity of sepsis in patients in the ICU. WBC count can increase in response to bacterial infection. Meanwhile, sepsis-associated leukopenia has been explained by impaired bone marrow production and peripheral overconsumption and/or destruction in response to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Several studies reported that DNI was closely related to sepsis severity, detection rate of blood cultures, DIC scores, and mortality in patients with suspected sepsis. Moreover, another study showed that DNI may serve as a more useful diagnostic and prognostic marker than lactate for early diagnosis of disease severity in patients with septic shock. More recently, leaving the usefulness of DNI on the field of critical medicine aside, DNI showed the association with several inflammatory status which could be overlooked by clinicians such as acute appendicitis, low-grade community-acquired pneumonia, or pyelonephritis in transplanted subjects. There were no significant differences in WBC counts or neutrophil proportion among the groups categorized using DNI values. In addition, WBC counts alone did not predict patient outcomes. However, there were significant relationships between DNI and DIC-related parameters, including platelet count, PT, and aPTT. These findings added to the evidence that baseline DNI is a significant determinant of mortality in AKI patients requiring CRRT. In addition, DNI is routinely performed and automatically calculated without additional costs. DNI values can be rapidly recognized in the CBC report. Taken together, we surmised that DNI could be an early and potent prognostic indicator in patients with S-AKI.

### The use of white blood cell count and left shift in the diagnosis of appendicitis in children [^efabb391]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2007). Low credibility.

Background

The use of white blood cell (WBC) count and left shift in the diagnosis of appendicitis in pediatric patients is unproven. It is commonly thought that children with appendicitis have an elevated WBC count with a left shift; however, most data supporting this belief stem from studies conducted on appendicitis in adults, not children. The purpose of this investigation was to determine the value of WBC count and differential in the diagnosis of appendicitis in children presenting to the emergency department (ED) with acute abdominal pain.

Methods

Seven hundred twenty-two pediatric ED patients with a primary complaint of nontraumatic abdominal pain were identified by prospective and retrospective methods. White blood cell count with differential was performed on patients with history and physical examination findings that were felt to warrant laboratory investigation. Results of WBC counts were determined as low, normal, or high, with or without a left shift, based on normal age-related values per laboratory protocol for pediatric patients.

Results

The diagnosis of appendicitis was made in 10.2% of all patients presenting to the ED with acute abdominal pain. Thirty percent of toddlers (1-3.9 years) with high WBC counts had appendicitis, whereas 0% of toddlers with low WBC counts and 4.8% of toddlers with normal WBC counts had appendicitis (chi = 6.5, P = 0.04). A normal WBC count did not rule out appendicitis in toddlers; however, the negative predictive value (NPV) for normal or low WBC count was high (NPV = 95.6%). In the child age group (4-11.9 years), high WBC count was both sensitive and specific for the diagnosis of appendicitis in children (sensitivity = 71%, specificity = 72%), and the NPV for normal or low WBC count was high (NPV = 89.5%). Lastly, 43.9% of adolescents (12-19 years) with high WBC counts had appendicitis, whereas 0% of adolescents with low WBC counts and 8.3% of adolescents with normal WBC counts had appendicitis (chi = 37.3, P < 0.001). The NPV for a low or normal WBC count was also high in the adolescent group (NPV = 91.9%). Left shift was also strongly associated with appendicitis. Among toddlers, 40% of patients with a left shift had appendicitis, whereas 1.8% of toddlers without a left shift had appendicitis (chi = 25.7, P < 0.001, NPV = 98.2%). Similarly, left shift was strongly associated with appendicitis in children and adolescents. Among children, 54.3% of patients with a left shift had appendicitis, whereas 5.4% of children without a left shift had appendicitis (chi = 67.8, P < 0.001, NPV = 90.5%). Among adolescents, 53.5% of patients with a left shift had appendicitis, whereas 6.1% of adolescents without a left shift had appendicitis (chi = 72.3, P < 0.001, NPV = 93.9%). In patients with a left shift, 51.2% had appendicitis, whereas 3.7% of patients without a left shift had appendicitis (chi = 226.2; P < 0.001, NPV = 96.3%). In all patients with appendicitis, elevated WBC counts had a sensitivity of 67% and a specificity of 80%. Using left shift alone as an indicator for appendicitis was associated with a sensitivity of 59% and a specificity of 90%. However, when a high WBC count and left shift were combined, the sensitivity climbed to 80%, and specificity remained at 79%. The sensitivity fell to 47% when both a high WBC count and left shift were analyzed, and specificity climbed to 94%. The positive likelihood ratio for a high WBC count and left shift was 9.8.

Conclusions

The determination of WBC count and differential is useful in the diagnosis of appendicitis in children presenting to the ED with nontraumatic acute abdominal pain, regardless of age. High WBC counts and left shift are independently, strongly associated with appendicitis in children aged 1 to 19 years. In fact, for this subset of patients older than 4 years, the most common diagnosis in the setting of an elevated WBC count was appendicitis. The presence of an increased WBC count or left shift carries with it a high sensitivity (79%), and the presence of both high WBC count and left shift has the highest specificity (94%). These values are, therefore, helpful in the diagnosis and exclusion of appendicitis. Although not absolute, the WBC count and left shift can be helpful in the diagnosis and exclusion of appendicitis.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^23a1cb52]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Bacterial pneumonia in individuals with HIV—clinical and radiographic presentation is similar to that in individuals without HIV, with patients caused by bacteria such as S. pneumoniae or Haemophilus characteristically having acute onset (3 to 5 days) of fevers, chills, rigors, chest pain or pleurisy, cough productive of purulent sputum, and dyspnea; tachypnea and decreased arterial oxygen saturation indicate moderate-to-severe pneumonia, and in such cases, clinicians should strongly consider hospitalizing the patient. Patients with bacterial pneumonia typically have signs of focal consolidation, such as egophony, and/or pleural effusion on examination, whereas in Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) lung examination often is normal and, if abnormal, reveals inspiratory crackles. In bacterial pneumonia the white blood cell (WBC) count usually is elevated, the elevation may be relative to baseline in those with advanced HIV, and neutrophilia or a left shift may be present. Chest radiographs characteristically show unilateral, focal, segmental, or lobar consolidation; those with S. pneumoniae or Haemophilus typically present with consolidation, whereas cavitation may be more suggestive of P. aeruginosa or S. aureus.

### Platelet-white cell ratio is more strongly associated with mortality than other common risk ratios derived from complete blood counts [^2aedd2a6]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Data collection

MGH cohorts were chosen to reflect diverse, high-burden settings of acute infection, ischemia, and decompensation. Each cohort comprised all adult admissions to MGH with the associated primary admitting diagnosis (COVID-19 infection, heart failure, myocardial infarction, stroke; based on ICD10 codes) between Jan-2016 and June-2022 (Mar-2020-June-2022 for COVID-19). Patients with <24 h hospital stays or without a CBC within 48 h of admission were excluded. For each patient, the CBC closest to 1 h post admission was analyzed. 30-day post-discharge, all-cause mortality was the primary outcome. CBCs were only considered if they included a white cell differential. The majority of patients had a CBC within 3 h of admission, and no significant associations were seen between time of first marker measurement and marker value (Supplementary Fig. 11).

For UWMC, each cohort comprised all adult admissions with the same associated primary admitting diagnosis as above between Jan-2010 and Dec-2023 (Mar-2020 and Dec-2023 for COVID-19). Due to a shift in UWMC’s primary EHR system in Apr-2021, most (~60%) patient admissions with sufficient data availability occurred after this date. For each cohort, the same restrictions on CBC availability and length of stay were applied as in the MGH cohort, and the same primary outcome was used.

For the UCIMC validation, we considered all surgeries in the database, which spanned a four-year period. To test consistency of findings in a different context, marker associations with mortality were evaluated pre-operatively. Analysis was limited to adult patients with at least 1 CBC + differential in the 48 h pre-surgery. If multiple CBCs were available, the closest one to 48 h pre-surgery was taken. The primary outcome was mortality at discharge.

Data from MGH and UW were collected from their respective electronic data warehouses, under separate research protocols approved by the corresponding local institutional review boards. UCIMC data is publicly availableand was used solely for research purposes.

### Combining intermediate levels of the endotoxin activity assay (EAA) with other biomarkers in the assessment of patients with sepsis: results of an observational study [^dd391d88]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

The Endotoxin Activity Assay (EAA) is a useful test to risk stratify patients with severe sepsis and assess for Gram negative infection. However, the significance of intermediate levels of EAA (0.4-0.59) at the bedside has not been well elucidated. The purpose of this study was to interpret intermediate EAA levels in clinical practice.

Methods

This retrospective observational study included all adult patients with suspected sepsis admitted to our medico-surgical intensive care unit (ICU) in whom EAA was measured from July 2008 to September 2011. Data collected included EAA, white blood cell (WBC) count and differential, C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT) and bacterial cultures. Data were analyzed by comparative statistics.

Results

Two hundred and ten patients were studied. Ninety two (43%) patients had culture documented gram negative infection. Patients with Gram-negative organisms in cultures had significantly higher EAA levels (0.47, IQR 0.27) than those without any Gram-negative organisms in cultures (0.34, IQR 0.22) (p < 0.0001). For patients with intermediate EAA levels (0.40 to 0.59), PCT levels and presence of left shift of WBC significantly differed between patients with Gram negative organisms in their blood or other cultures and those who had no organisms in any of the cultures (4.9 versus 1.7 ng/mL, p < 0.05; 57.9 versus 18.9%, p < 0.0004, respectively).

Conclusions

We confirm that high levels of EAA in our cohort of patients with suspected sepsis are strongly associated with gram negative infection. In those patients with intermediate elevation in EAA levels, use of PCT and WBC differential can provide additional diagnostic value to clinicians at the bedside.

### Clinical features and prognostic predictors of C. psittaci pneumonia: a systematic review and individual patient meta-analysis [^0af9ef22]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

In the acute phase of infection, leukocytes are usually normal or slightly reduced, but accompanied by a left shift. In our study, 22.8% of patients had elevated leukocyte counts, while 59.9% had elevated neutrophil counts. Elevated leukocytes in the later stages of infection usually indicate the activation of systemic inflammation or co-infection with bacteria. Since neutrophils in patients with psittacosis are usually normal, CRP, interleukin-6 (IL-6), and procalcitonin have been recommended for monitoring therapeutic efficacy. In terms of imaging, failure to receive timely treatment may lead to the fusion of multiple lesions and eventual dissemination throughout all lobes. We found that the percentage of patients with pleural effusion was approximately 45%, which is consistent with previous research results. In addition, severe patients have a greater probability of developing multilobar involvement and pleural effusion. Hence, the assessment of disease progression in patients can also be inferred from their imaging features at admission.

The in-hospital mortality rate was 4.6%, which increased to 8.9% in severe cases. Chlamydia psittaci primarily induces respiratory symptoms but can disseminate to multiple systems through the bloodstream, giving rise to diverse clinical manifestations and complications. We found that the presence of dyspnea, gastrointestinal symptoms, and neuropsychiatric symptoms on admission often indicates a poor prognosis. Additionally, other rare complications including rhabdomyolysis, meningitis, hemophagocytic syndrome, and even fulminant psittacosis are noteworthy. According to the data from the CDC, the mortality rate of psittacosis is < 1% if diagnosed earlier and properly treated. Thus, more frequent testing of CAP patients is recommended to reduce the diagnostic deficit and under-ascertainment.

In recent years, mNGS has emerged as a valuable tool for addressing the limitations of traditional detection methods, including culture, serology, and PCR techniques. One major finding is that due to the widespread application of mNGS, the diagnosis of atypical pathogens such as Chlamydia psittaci has increased. In this study, 87.4% of patients were diagnosed through mNGS of sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, or blood samples, suggesting the potential greater contribution of Chlamydia psittaci to the etiology of CAP.

### Why does my patient have leukocytosis? [^63420681]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Leukocytosis is one of the most common laboratory abnormalities in medicine, and one of the most frequent reasons for hematologic consultation. Effective evaluation of leukocytosis requires an attentive history, careful physical examination, meticulous review of the complete blood count and peripheral blood smear, judicious application of laboratory and radiologic testing, and thoughtful analysis. Definitive diagnosis may require bone marrow aspiration and biopsy, imaging studies, and specialized molecular tests. The differential diagnosis of leukocytosis includes physiologic responses to a broad range of infectious and inflammatory processes, as well as numerous primary hematologic disorders such as leukemias, lymphomas, and myeloproliferative neoplasms.

Pediatric appendicitis—clinical and laboratory predictors are described, with combined variable scoring yielding a negative likelihood ratio of 0.058 (95% CI 0.008 to 0.41). In children presenting to the emergency department, for both an elevated white blood cell (WBC) count and a left shift the positive likelihood ratio was 9.8, whereas for either an elevated WBC count or a left shift the negative likelihood ratio was 0.26; individually, an elevated WBC count (positive likelihood ratio 3.4; negative likelihood ratio 0.41) and a left shift (positive likelihood ratio 5.9; negative likelihood ratio 0.45) were not as strong. A Class III prospective study found that temperature greater than 38°C, a WBC count of 10,100/ mm3 or greater, and rebound tenderness were significantly associated with pediatric appendicitis, and a resulting prediction rule had a 1% missed appendicitis rate and a 9% negative appendectomy rate. Additional retrospective data identified guarding and temperature greater than 38.4°C as predictive in girls 5 to 12 years of age, and tenderness and vomiting as predictive in boys 5 to 12 years of age.

### Distinct patterns of vital sign and inflammatory marker responses in adults with suspected bloodstream infection [^e61e989e]. The Journal of Infection (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Timely initiation of active antimicrobials is an important priority in sepsis,but blood cultures identify a pathogen in only up to 30–40% of bloodstream infections (BSI).Hence, most antimicrobials are started, and often continued, empirically. In this context, key questions include “how do I know my patient is responding to treatment?” and “when should I switch antibiotics?” as potentially not providing adequate treatment in some patients leads to more severe infections and higher mortality.Conversely, over use of empirical broad-spectrum antibiotics, either initially or as escalation for inadequate response contributes risks increasing antimicrobial resistance and hence worse outcomes over the longer term.

Where blood cultures are negative or results not yet available, laboratory test results (e.g. C-reactive protein (CRP),,,,,,procalcitonin,,,,and white blood cell (WBC) counts) and vital signs (e.g. temperature, heart rate and respiratory rate) can guide treatment decisions. Scoring systems, including the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) Score, can also provide insights into status and risk of deterioration.Among these, the role of serial CRP measurements in monitoring treatment response has been previously studied.,,Patterns of relative CRP change (i.e. ratio of measurements on day 4 or 5 to those at baseline) has been found to correlate with clinical outcomes.However, host responses are heterogeneous, both at presentation and throughout infections,,due to factors such as the causative pathogens, sources of infection, and individual patient characteristics. The relationship between routinely collected clinical parameters and these factors has not been well described.

### Intersecting paths of emerging and reemerging infectious diseases [^5c5b2df4]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

The clinicopathologic and IHC findings indicate that both patients died from HPS. Although SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected by RT-PCR in patient 1, it was not the probable underlying cause of death. This scenario provides an essential reminder that previously recognized, nonendemic infectious diseases that clinically resemble COVID-19 continue to occur during the pandemic, in a manner similar to other clinicopathologic mimics described previously during other pandemic diseases.

Consideration of alternative diagnoses of diseases that precipitate acute respiratory distress syndrome and co-infections remains crucial for diagnosing and treating of critically ill patients, as well as accurately determining causes of death. For HPS, triage tools such as peripheral blood smear review and identifying 4 of 5 findings (thrombocytopenia, hemoconcentration, granulocytic left shift, absence of toxic changes, and >10% immunoblasts) can be used to diagnose the disease rapidly and presumptively in the clinical setting. Communication and partnerships of local, state, and federal public health officials and healthcare professionals, including clinicians, infectious disease specialists, pathologists, and medical examiners, are essential during these challenging times of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.

### Don't miss the diagnosis of sepsis! [^d56b3c34]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Sepsis is amongst the most common reasons for admission to ICUs throughout the world. The early detection and timely administration of appropriate antibiotics are the most important factors in improving the outcome of patients with sepsis. However, the initial signs and symptoms of sepsis are frequently non-specific, leading to a delay in diagnosis. Furthermore, the diagnostic characteristics of the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) are not useful in distinguishing infectious from non-infectious causes of SIRS. An elevated white blood count, neutrophilia or eosinopenia are frequently used to diagnose bacterial sepsis; however, these variables have low diagnostic value.

### Update in sepsis guidelines: what is really new? [^3be36146]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2017). Low credibility.

New definitions from sSepsis-3

Sepsis, severe sepsis and the SOFA score

The 2012 sepsis guidelines defined sepsis as ‘the presence (probable or documented) of infection together with systemic manifestations of infection’.In the 2016 guidelines, sepsis is redefined by the taskforce as ‘a life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection’.This new definition highlights the three critical components of sepsis, namely the presence of infection, the abnormal regulation of the host response to infection and the resulting organ system dysfunction as a result of the host response.

One of the most significant changes in the new definitions was the elimination of a defined condition of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). The SIRS criteria have included temperature >38°C or <36°C, heart rate more than 90 beats per minute, respiratory rate of more than 20 breaths per minute and white blood cell count >12 000/µL or <4000/µL or >10% immature (band) forms. Traditionally, more than two SIRS criteria were felt to represent patients at risk of or suffering from sepsis. The taskforce determined that the inclusion of two SIRS criteria did not provide appropriate discrimination between those suffering sepsis and an appropriate physiological response to insult (infection or otherwise). Likewise, many patients with two or more SIRS criteria never go on to develop an infection or sepsis.Thus, the presence of SIRS criteria has been removed from the definition of sepsis. In addition, the term ‘severe sepsis’ (previously defined as sepsis accompanied by sepsis-induced organ dysfunction) was removed from the guidelines, as this term is redundant to the 2016 definition of sepsis. This change highlights the taskforce’s focus on organ dysfunction as a critical component in the diagnosis of sepsis. The taskforce identified ‘life-threatening organ dysfunction’ by ‘an increase [from baseline] in the Sequential [Sepsis-related] Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score of 2 points or more’.

Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2024). High credibility.

Complete blood count (CBC) in suspected ABA—A complete blood count (CBC) with differential generally should be performed on initial evaluation of children with suspected ABA; the peripheral white blood cell (WBC) count is often, but not always, elevated, is higher on average with adjacent osteomyelitis infection than without and may be higher when ABA is caused by S. aureus or streptococcal species than K. kingae, but substantial overlap precludes the use of a specific diagnostic cut-off value; WBC does not differ on average between confirmed and presumed ABA cases; CBC on admission also is not useful in distinguishing ABA from Lyme arthritis; and while WBC is often higher in ABA than transient nonbacterial synovitis, substantial overlap precludes diagnostic value in distinguishing these entities.

### The complete blood count: a practical tool for the pediatrician [^eec1e953]. Pediatrics in Review (2023). Medium credibility.

Every child should have a baseline hematology evaluation with hemoglobin and hematocrit levels starting at age 12 months, or younger if clinically indicated. Although history and physical examination provide key information needed to diagnose blood disorders, the addition of a complete blood count (CBC) with differential count and reticulocyte count allows the clinician to narrow the differential diagnosis and tailor the subsequent evaluation. The interpretation of CBC results is a skill that requires practice. Every clinician can learn to identify possible diagnoses before consulting a specialist. This review provides a step-by-step approach for CBC interpretation with tools to help the clinician diagnose and interpret the most common blood disorders seen in the general pediatric clinic or inpatient setting.

### Clinical utility of routine CBC testing in patients with community-acquired pneumonia [^939ede24]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

The goal of this study was to identify situations in which routine complete blood count (CBC) testing could be avoided in patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). This was a retrospective study of 50 patients with CAP. Vital signs, lab results, assessment and plan data, and computerized provider order entry logs were collected to determine if a lab result or clinical finding changed clinical management. Clinical stability was defined based on Patient Outcomes Research Team study criteria. There were 94 CBCs obtained after admission, of which only 6 were associated with management changes. Only two of these instances involved management changes related to patients' pneumonia, while the other cases represented chronic illnesses. Among all patients, the positive likelihood ratio of a post-admission CBC predicting a change in clinical management was low (1.12 [95% confidence interval, 0.86-1.44]). Low utility of CBC testing after admission may represent an opportunity to improvethe value of care in CAP patients. Journal of Hospital Medicine 2017;12:336-338.

### Diabetic foot disorders. A clinical practice guideline (2006 revision) [^fc31587d]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2007). Medium credibility.

Diagnostic procedures—laboratory tests in the diabetic foot—Consideration should be given to the following tests, but many lack the ability to impart a definitive diagnosis, necessitating clinical correlation. Clinical laboratory tests that may be needed include fasting or random blood glucose, glycohemoglobin (HbA1c), complete blood count (CBC) with or without differential, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), serum chemistries, C-reactive protein, alkaline phosphatase, wound and blood cultures, and urinalysis. Caution must be exercised in the interpretation of laboratory tests because several reports have documented the absence of leukocytosis in the presence of severe foot infections, and a common sign of persistent infection is recalcitrant hyperglycemia despite usual antihyperglycemic regimens.

### The American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons clinical practice guidelines for the management of Clostridioides difficile infection [^3b16ecb9]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2021). High credibility.

Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) severity assessment—patients should be evaluated to determine the severity of CDI and for the presence of peritonitis or multisystem organ failure. Grade of recommendation: Strong recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 1C. Clinical assessment and laboratory testing (complete blood count and renal and liver function) are typically performed to evaluate the patient and to help identify potential organ failure and associated sepsis, and a significant leukocytosis typically raises the suspicion for CDI but is not considered pathognomonic. The stratification of the severity of CDI as mild/nonsevere, severe, or severe-complicated/fulminant is loosely defined; diarrhea, leukocytosis (but less than 15 x 10^3/μL), and abdominal pain with positive testing for C difficile in the absence of hypotension or organ failure such as kidney injury is typically defined as mild disease, whereas severe CDI typically includes an elevated creatinine or leukocytosis over 15 x 10^3/μL.

### Elevated bands as a predictor of bloodstream infection and in-hospital mortality [^12356a51]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

Although >10% bands on a CBC has been a part of the definition for sepsis, scant data exists regarding the clinical significance of lower percentages of bands. Our aim was to determine whether any associations exist between percentage of bands on an initial CBC and likelihood of a bloodstream infection and in-hospital mortality.

Methods

We performed a retrospective study of emergency department adults from January 1, 2016 to September 1, 2019 who had a CBC with manual differential and blood cultures obtained during their initial evaluation. Band percentages were grouped into zero (0% bands), minimal (1-2% bands), mild (3-4% bands), moderate (5-10% bands) and high (>10% bands). The primary outcomes were bloodstream infections and in-hospital mortality.

Results

Increasing rates of bloodstream infections were observed as bands went from zero (95% CI: 9.3%-10.5%) to minimal (17.5%-19.1%, p < 0.0001), minimal to mild (19.2%-22.0%, p = 0.0039), mild to moderate (23.5%-26.7%, p < 0.0001), and moderate to high (33.0%-37.4%, p < 0.0001). Similar observations were seen when comparing mortality. The most common bloodstream infections were due to Gram-negative bacilli.

Conclusion

Elevated bands on an initial CBC were correlated with the likelihood of a concurrent bloodstream infection and in-hospital mortality, even at levels below 10%. Our results suggest that clinical suspicion for a bloodstream infection due to Gram-negative bacilli should rise if bands are elevated on an initial CBC. Therefore, clinicians should consider obtaining blood cultures if bands are elevated on an initial CBC.

### Biomarkers: what is their benefit in the identification of infection, severity assessment, and management of community-acquired pneumonia? [^98d8e82f]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Biomarkers have been proposed as tools that can guide the management of patients with community-acquired pneumonia, providing information that supplements the usually available clinical data. Among the available biomarkers, procalcitonin has been studied extensively and seems promising for several purposes. The use of biomarkers needs further study, to validate their utility in daily practice, especially given the limitations of the current tools for identifying the need for antibiotic therapy in patients with influenza and secondary bacterial pneumonia, in patients with aspiration syndromes, and in those infected with atypical pathogens.

### Complete blood count in children with COVID-19: a predictor of disease severity [^45819c23]. Clinical Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Blood count abnormalities are frequent in patients with severe COVID-19 disease and there is still a lack of information in pediatric complete blood count (CBC) results. Thus, this study aims to correlate the CBC in the emergency room of children with COVID-19 between 0 and 10 years old and the clinical severity of the disease. A retrospective cohort study was performed in children with COVID-19 who collected at the emergency room CBC, C-reactive protein (CRP), platelet to lymphocyte ratio (PLR), neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), neutrophil to monocyte ratio (NMR), lymphocyte to neutrophil ratio (LNR), lymphocyte to monocyte ratio (LMR), monocyte to neutrophil ratio (MNR) and monocyte to lymphocyte ratio (MLR). In total, demographic data from 93 children with median age of 19 months (0.3-126), 60.2% males, were included. The main changes in the CBC were atypical lymphocytes (51.6%) and eosinopenia (49.5%). From 69 hospitalized children, 21 were considered severe. There was no association between age, gender, and CRP value with clinical severity. The presence of underlying disease was five times higher (odds ratio [OR] = 5.08) in patients who required hospitalization and a higher NLR value was 54% (OR = 1.54) more likely to occur. Eosinopenia was three times more frequent in inpatients with disease severity criteria (OR = 3.05). In conclusion, children younger than 10 years of age with COVID-19 have changes in the CBC collected in the emergency room, mainly atypical lymphocytes and eosinopenia. The presence of a comorbidity or a higher NLR increases the chance of hospitalization. In addition, eosinopenia was a predictor of severity in inpatient children due to COVID-19.

Combining PCT levels, left shift of neutrophils, and Gram-negative organisms in patients with intermediate EAA levels (0.4 to 0.59)

Patients with EAA levels of 0.4 to 0.59 were divided into two groups according to the appearance of left shift of neutrophils or PCT values of more than 5 ng/mL or both. The presence of Gram-negative organisms was compared between the two groups (Table 4). There were 36 patients (45.6%) with left shift of neutrophils or PCT levels of more than 5 ng/mL or both and 43 patients (54.4%) without left shift of neutrophils or PCT levels of less than 5 ng/mL or both. Of the 36 patients, 25 patients were positive for Gram-negative organisms in any culture; of the 43 patients without left shift of neutrophils or PCT levels of less than 5 ng/mL or both, 26 patients were negative for Gram-negative organisms in any culture. A statistically significant difference was shown for the presence of Gram-negative organisms between the groups (P = 0.0008). The positive predictive value (PPV) was 59.5%, whereas the negative predictive value (NPV) was 70.2%. In the low level of EAA, the PPV and the NPV were 29.1% and 72.7%, respectively. In the high level of EAA, the PPV and the NPV were 82.4% and 50.0%, respectively.

### Successful triage of suspected hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome by peripheral blood smear review: a decade of experience in an endemic region [^f6d39372]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2014). Low credibility.

Objectives

In 2001, the University of New Mexico Hospitals implemented a rapid screening tool for the triage of suspected hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome based on peripheral blood smear morphology. Five criteria guided clinical decisions: thrombocytopenia, hemoconcentration, granulocytic left shift, absence of toxic changes, and more than 10% immunoblasts. Smears meeting four of five criteria were previously shown to have high predictive value for infection. Our retrospective study aimed to determine clinical performance of this test over the past decade.

Methods

Computerized records of 188 smear results were compared with serology.

Results

Receiver operator characteristic curve analysis confirmed that the four of five cutoff was the most clinically useful, with sensitivity and specificity of 89% and 93%, respectively. All patients meeting five of five criteria had confirmed infections. Fifteen discordant results were uncovered, explained by positive subsequent tests in the same patient or severe disease without further testing.

Conclusions

Our findings confirm that peripheral smear analysis is clinically useful in this endemic region.

### Epidemiologic notes and reports toxic-shock syndrome – United States (...) [^c285ab56]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Physicians in 8 other states have reported individual cases to CDC or to investigators at the University of Colorado, Denver. Toxic-shock syndrome typically begins suddenly with high fever, vomiting, and profuse watery diarrhea, sometimes accompanied by sore throat, headache, and myalgias. The disease progresses to hypotensive shock within 48 hours, and the patient develops a diffuse, macular, erythematous rash with non-purulent conjunctivitis. Urine output is often decreased, and patients may be disoriented or combative. The adult respiratory distress syndrome or cardiac dysfunction may also be seen. Laboratory studies reveal elevated blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, bilirubin, and creatine phosphokinase levels, and white blood cell counts with marked left shifts. Platelet counts are low in the first week of illness but are usually high in the second week. Patients require large volumes of fluid to maintain perfusion and usually require intensive care.

In the recovery phase, there is desquamation of at least the palms, soles, or digits and often of other skin areas as well. Of 40 patients in whom a menstrual history was obtained, 38 had onset of illness with the 5-day period following onset of menses. Two others had onset of illness 10 days after onset of menses. Moreover, 13 patients have had recurrence of symptoms with a subsequent menstrual period. In 33 of 45 patients cultured, Staphylococcus aureus was isolated from the throat, cervix, vagina, or rectum. Four of 15 patients tested for Herpesvirus hominis had serologic or cultural evidence of herpes infection. No evidence for leptospirosis, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, viral exanthematous diseases, or streptococcal scarlet fever has been found in those patients in whom it has been looked for. The syndrome resembles Kawasaki disease in several respects, namely fever, rash with subsequent desquamation, and cardiac involvement.

However, shock, which is prominent in toxic-shock syndrome, is not usually seen in Kawasaki disease. The character of the rash is also different in the 2 diseases: it is a maculopapular one in Kawasaki disease but a non-papular, diffuse erythroderma in toxic-shock syndrome. The isolation of Herpesvirus in a small number of cases probably reflects stress-related recurrence of infection and not an etiologic role for the virus.

### Plasma myeloperoxidase-conjugated DNA level predicts outcomes and organ dysfunction in patients with septic shock [^ae83a87c]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Patients

The present study was a secondary analysis of a previous prospective observational multicenter cohort study that investigated the incidence and prognosis of septic shock in Japan (Japan Sepsis Study). That study was conducted from April 2008 to March 2010, enrolling patients admitted to the ICUs of 35 Japanese hospitals, among whom 31 patients were eligible for the present study. In addition, collection of medical data and blood samples was continued at the ICU of Aichi Medical University Hospital according to the same study design from April 2011 to July 2017, proving another 24 patients for this study (55 in total). The ethics committee at each hospital approved the protocol of this study, and informed consent was obtained from each patient or from a relative or legal representative if direct consent could not be obtained.

Fifty-five patients with septic shock aged between 36 and 91 years were enrolled who met both of the following criteria: 1) systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) caused by infection (according to the consensus definition of the American College of Chest Physicians/Society of Critical Care Medicine Consensus Conference Committee); and 2) hypotension (systolic blood pressure ≤ 90 mmHg or decrease in systolic blood pressure ≥ 40 mmHg from baseline) persisting for at least 1 h despite adequate fluid infusion and requiring pressor agents to maintain a systolic blood pressure around 90 mmHg or mean arterial pressure (MAP) < 65 mmHg, associated with hypoperfusion (including lactic acidosis, oliguria, and/or acute changes of mental state). SIRS was diagnosed if patients had at least two of the following clinical features: temperature < 36 °C or > 38 °C; heart rate > 90/min; respiration rate > 20/min or arterial PCO 2 < 32 mmHg; and white blood cell count > 12,000/mm 3 or < 4000/mm 3, or left shift of the differential white blood cell count with band forms ≥ 10%. The exclusion criteria were terminal cancer, terminal hematological illness, severe hepatic dysfunction (total bilirubin ≥ 10 mg/dl and hepaplastin test ≤ 40%), and refusal to provide written consent. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) was diagnosed based on the Japanese Association for Acute Medicine DIC diagnosis criteria. All patients were managed according to the Surviving Sepsis Campaign protocol 2008, including fluid resuscitation, use of vasopressors, transfusion, and timely initiation of antibiotic therapy. The following data were obtained from an established registry database: demographic information, site of infection, results of culture and laboratory tests, hemodynamic variables, and therapeutic interventions. All patients were followed up for 28 days after enrollment to assess the 28-day mortality rate. To evaluate organ dysfunction and the severity of sepsis, the SOFA score and the APACHE II score were determined. The control subjects were 13 healthy age-matched volunteers with no significant acute or chronic illnesses.

### Mifepristone (Mifeprex) [^61d84305]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Infection and Sepsis

As with other types of abortion, cases of serious bacterial infection, including very rare cases of fatal septic shock, have been reported following the use of MIFEPREX [see Boxed Warning] . Healthcare providers evaluating a patient who is undergoing a medical abortion should be alert to the possibility of this rare event. A sustained (> 4 hours) fever of 100.4°F or higher, severe abdominal pain, or pelvic tenderness in the days after a medical abortion may be an indication of infection.

A high index of suspicion is needed to rule out sepsis (e.g., from Clostridium sordellii) if a patient reports abdominal pain or discomfort or general malaise (including weakness, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea) more than 24 hours after taking misoprostol. Very rarely, deaths have been reported in patients who presented without fever, with or without abdominal pain, but with leukocytosis with a marked left shift, tachycardia, hemoconcentration, and general malaise. No causal relationship between MIFEPREX and misoprostol use and an increased risk of infection or death has been established. Clostridium sordellii infections have also been reported very rarely following childbirth (vaginal delivery and caesarian section), and in other gynecologic and non-gynecologic conditions.

### Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): focus on peripheral blood cell morphology [^ea9787cd]. British Journal of Haematology (2023). Medium credibility.

Numerous studies have shown peculiar morphological anomalies in COVID-19 patients' smears. We searched all the peer-reviewed scientific publications that explicitly reference the cytomorphological alterations on peripheral blood smears of patients with COVID-19. We extracted data from sixty-five publications (case reports, patient group studies, reviews, and erythrocyte morphology studies). The results show that frequent alterations concern the morphology of lymphocytes (large lymphocytes with weakly basophilic cytoplasm, plasmacytoid lymphocytes, large granular lymphocytes). Neutrophils display abnormal nuclei and cytoplasm in a distinctive cytomorphological picture. Besides a left shift in maturation, granulations can be increased (toxic type) or decreased with areas of basophilia. Nuclei are often hyposegmented (pseudo-Pelger-Huёt anomaly). Apoptotic or pycnotic cells are not uncommon. Monocytes typically have a large cytoplasm loaded with heterogeneous and coalescing vacuoles. Platelets show large and giant shapes. The presence of erythrocyte fragments and schistocytes is especially evident in the forms of COVID-19 that are associated with thrombotic microangiopathies. Such atypia of blood cells reflects the generalized activation in severe COVID-19, which has been demonstrated with immunophenotypic, molecular, genetic, and functional methods. Neutrophils, in particular, are involved in the pathophysiology of hyperinflammation with cytokine storm, which characterizes the most unfavorable evolution.

### Wash, rinse, repeat: which patients undergo serial joint irrigation in pediatric septic hip arthritis? [^fd3708f5]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The purpose of this study is to identify risk factors associated with repeat surgical irrigation in pediatric septic hip arthritis.

Methods

A single center retrospective case-control study was performed. Patients who underwent ≥2 washouts (cases) were compared with those who had only 1 washout (controls). Demographic, clinical, laboratory, microbial, and magnetic resonance imaging data were compared between cases and controls and a prediction model was developed using logistic regression. A risk score was then constructed by counting the number of risk factors from the model that were present in each patient.

Results

We identified 26 patients between 1994 and 2015 who underwent ≥2 washouts for septic hip arthritis, and 63 control patients who had only a single washout. Twenty-two patients had 2 washouts, 3 had 4 washouts, 1 had 5 washouts. Median number of days between first and second washout was 5 (interquartile range, 4 to 8). The most common reason for repeat washout was persistent fever (N=21), followed by persistently elevated laboratory values (N=13), abnormal magnetic resonance imaging findings (N=12), and continued pain (N=12). Repeat washout cases demonstrated higher temperature preoperatively (P<0.001), had more frequent initial misdiagnosis (P=0.002), and had a longer time from symptom onset to surgery (P=0.02). Laboratory values in these cases showed higher C-reactive protein (P=0.003), and more frequent left shift (P=0.03) at presentation, with a greater proportion of positive cultures (P<0.001). Postoperatively, repeat washout cases had higher temperatures (P<0.001), more frequent wound drainage (P=0.02), and complications (P=0.001). A risk score for predicting the likelihood of undergoing repeat washout was constructed by counting the number of the following factors present: presence of left shift in CBC, positive blood or synovial fluid cultures, and postoperative temperature over 39°C. Seventy percent of cases had ≥2 of these risk factors and 80% of controls had ≤1 risk factor.

Conclusions

Cases of pediatric septic arthritis which undergo repeat washout are associated with left shift, high postoperative temperatures, and positive cultures. They have more frequent misdiagnosis leading to delayed treatment and subsequent medical complications.

### The diagnostic value of absolute neutrophil count, band count and morphologic changes of neutrophils in predicting bacterial infections [^5dba37ea]. Medical Principles and Practice (2007). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC)" for febrile neutropenia.

The Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) is a clinical calculator used primarily in the field of hematology and oncology. It is applicable to patients who have undergone chemotherapy, those with suspected neutropenia, or those at risk for severe infection due to immunosuppression. The ANC is calculated from the total white blood cell count and the percentage of neutrophils, providing a measure of the body's primary defense against bacterial infections. 

The clinical utility of the ANC lies in its ability to assess the severity of neutropenia and the risk of infection in patients. It is particularly useful in monitoring patients undergoing chemotherapy, as these individuals are at a high risk for neutropenia and subsequent infection. 

There are no specific exclusion criteria for the use of the ANC. However, it should be noted that the ANC may not accurately reflect the risk of infection in patients with conditions that cause functional neutrophil defects, such as chronic granulomatous disease. Additionally, the ANC may be less useful in patients with conditions that cause neutrophilia, such as corticosteroid use or acute stress, as these conditions can artificially elevate the neutrophil count.

Like PCT, results are available within minutes with point-of-care assays or within an hour with laboratory-based assays; laboratory assays are quantitative and suitable for serial monitoring. Unlike PCT, CRP concentrations can be affected by neutropenia, immunodeficiency, and use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.

### Comparison of blood counts and markers of inflammation and coagulation in patients with and without COVID-19 presenting to the emergency department in Seattle, WA [^5e616705]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

We compared complete blood count (CBC) with differential and markers of inflammation and coagulation in patients with and without coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) presenting to emergency departments in Seattle, WA.

Methods

We reviewed laboratory values for 1 week following each COVID-19 test for adult patients who received a standard severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test before April 13, 2020. Results were compared by COVID-19 status and clinical course.

Results

In total 1,027 patients met inclusion criteria. Patients with COVID-19 (n = 155) had lower leukocytes (P < .0001), lymphocytes (P < .0001), platelets (P < .0001), and higher hemoglobin (P = .0140) than those without, but absolute differences were small. Serum albumin was lower in patients with COVID-19 (P < .0001) and serum albumin, neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and red cell distribution width (RDW) were each associated with disease severity. NLR did not differ between patients with COVID-19 and those without (P = .8012).

Conclusions

Patients with COVID-19 had modestly lower leukocyte, lymphocyte, and platelet counts and higher hemoglobin values than patients without COVID-19. The NLR, serum albumin, and RDW varied with disease severity, regardless of COVID-19 status.

White blood cell count increase

White blood cell count increase was assessed for the target conditions: mortality, and deterioration.

For mortality (10 studies), the cut‐off values to define white blood cell count increase varied between 9.31 and 11 x 10 9 cells/L. Sensitivity in the included studies ranged from 16% to 74%, and specificity ranged from 50% to 94%. The median specificity was 82%, with the interquartile range from 61% to 89%. The summary estimate of sensitivity corresponding with a specificity of 61%, was 38% (95% CI 35% to 40%). The summary estimate of sensitivity corresponding with the median specificity of 82%, was 37% (95% CI 34% to 40%) and the summary estimate of sensitivity corresponding with a specificity of 89%, was 36% (95% CI 33% to 39%).

For deterioration (13 studies), the cut‐off values varied between 5.27 and 11 x 10 9 cells/L. At a fixed specificity of 75% (Q1), 89% (median), and 94% (Q3), meta‐analysis found a sensitivity of 40% (95% CI 35% to 44%), 32% (95% CI 28% to 36%), and 27% (95% CI 22% to 32%), respectively.

### Filgrastim-aafi (Nivestym) [^3a2bde2a]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

In phase 1 studies involving 96 patients with various non-myeloid malignancies‚ filgrastim administration resulted in a dose-dependent increase in circulating neutrophil counts over the dose range of 1 to 70 mcg/kg/day. This increase in neutrophil counts was observed whether filgrastim was administered intravenous (1 to 70 mcg/kg twice daily)‚ subcutaneous (1 to 3 mcg/kg once daily)‚ or by continuous subcutaneous infusion (3 to 11 mcg/kg/day). With discontinuation of filgrastim therapy‚ neutrophil counts returned to baseline in most cases within 4 days. Isolated neutrophils displayed normal phagocytic (measured by zymosan-stimulated chemoluminescence) and chemotactic (measured by migration under agarose using N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine [fMLP] as the chemotaxin) activity in vitro.

The absolute monocyte count was reported to increase in a dose-dependent manner in most patients receiving filgrastim; however‚ the percentage of monocytes in the differential count remained within the normal range. Absolute counts of both eosinophils and basophils did not change and were within the normal range following administration of filgrastim. Increases in lymphocyte counts following filgrastim administration have been reported in some normal subjects and patients with cancer.

White blood cell (WBC) differentials obtained during clinical trials have demonstrated a shift towards earlier granulocyte progenitor cells (left shift)‚ including the appearance of promyelocytes and myeloblasts‚ usually during neutrophil recovery following the chemotherapy-induced nadir. In addition‚ Dohle bodies‚ increased granulocyte granulation‚ and hypersegmented neutrophils have been observed. Such changes were transient and were not associated with clinical sequelae, nor were they necessarily associated with infection.

### Don't miss the diagnosis of sepsis! [^21ced1a3]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

The early detection and treatment of sepsis are the most important factors in improving the outcome of patients with this condition. However, many patients admitted to hospital experience a long delay in the diagnosis of sepsis. Furthermore, it is not uncommon for febrile patients to be sent home from the Emergency Department or the physician’s office with the diagnosis of ‘flu’ only to return hours or days later in overt septic shock. The early diagnosis of sepsis may be challenging as many of the signs and symptoms are non-specific. Clinical studies suggest that early diagnosis of sepsis requires a high index of suspicion and comprehensive clinical evaluation together with laboratory tests, including a complete blood count with differential, lactate and procalcitonin levels.

Clinical Classification of ED Patients

Study subjects were categorized based on the “Sepsis-2” consensus criteria, such as non-SIRS (i.e. zero or one SIRS criterion [SIRS criteria are as follows: WBC > 12,000 or < 4,000 or > 10% bands; pulse > 90; respiratory rate > 20; and temperature < 96.8°F or > 100.4°F]) and no infection, SIRS (≥ 2 SIRS criteria), sepsis (infection plus SIRS) (including sepsis [no organ failures], severe sepsis [sepsis with one or more organ failures], and septic shock [sepsis with refractory hypotension]), and infection but no sepsis (i.e. zero or one SIRS criterion), and based on the Sepsis-3 criteria, such as controls, infection, and sepsis (based on Sequential Organ Failure Assessment SOFA (SOFA or SOFA score [sTable 6, Supplemental Digital Content 11,])] criteria). The presence of infection was determined based on the retrospective chart review of tests performed and clinical data available within the first 12 hours of ED presentation. If no workup for infection was initiated within 12 hours, the patient was categorized as “not infected” by the adjudicator. Test results were extracted from the records 7–10 days later, including cultures, molecular tests (e.g. polymerase chain reaction and antigens), relevant imaging, and tissue pathology (such test results, particularly cultures, were often reported days after admission).

In order to characterize sepsis as being present upon ED admission, sepsis criteria had to be fulfilled within 12 hours of the initial CBC in patients with suspected infection (as reflected by initiation of diagnostic infection workup) and appropriate clinical categorization was verified by expert review of the extracted electronic medical record data by at least two independent investigators at each site. Discordances were arbitrated by a third independent physician reviewer.

### Asenapine [^0568f356]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.9 Leukopenia, Neutropenia, and Agranulocytosis

In clinical trial and postmarketing experience, leukopenia and neutropenia have been reported temporally related to antipsychotic agents, including asenapine. Agranulocytosis (including fatal cases) has been reported with other agents in the class.

Possible risk factors for leukopenia/neutropenia include pre-existing low white blood cell count (WBC) or absolute neutrophil count (ANC) and history of drug induced leukopenia/neutropenia. In patients with a pre-existing low WBC or ANC or a history of drug-induced leukopenia or neutropenia, perform a complete blood count (CBC) during the first few months of therapy. In such patients, consider discontinuation of asenapine at the first sign of a clinically significant decline in WBC in the absence of other causative factors.

Monitor patients with clinically significant neutropenia for fever or other symptoms or signs of infection and treat promptly if such symptoms or signs occur. Discontinue asenapine in patients with severe neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count <1000/mm) and follow their WBC until recovery.

### Bacteremic elder emergency department patients: procalcitonin and white count [^29d60349]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Objectives

To assess serum procalcitonin (PCT) and white blood cell (WBC) count in detecting bacteremia in elder emergency department (ED) patients.

Methods

A prospective, observational study of ED patients aged > or =65 years in whom blood cultures were drawn was conducted at an urban, tertiary care, academic ED. Serum for PCT and WBC count was obtained at the time of ED visit. Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves, proportions, and likelihood ratios were calculated.

Results

One hundred eight patients met entry criteria, 14 with bacteremia. In comparing bacteremic patients versus all others, PCT > 0.2 ng/mL was 93% sensitive (95% confidence interval [CI] = 79% to 100%) and 38% specific (95% CI = 28% to 48%) with a negative likelihood ratio (LR(-)) of 0.18. Abnormal WBC count was 64% sensitive (95% CI = 39% to 89%) and 54% specific (95% CI = 44% to 64%) with an LR(-) of 0.78. The presence of either abnormal WBC count or left shift was 93% sensitive (95% CI = 74% to 100%) but 11% specific (95% CI = 4% to 11%) with an LR(-) of 0.64. When considering only bacteremic patients versus noninfected patients, PCT at a cutoff of 0.2 ng/mL had an LR(-) of 0.12. Area under a ROC curve was significantly greater for PCT (0.7; 95% CI = 0.6 to 0.9) than for abnormal WBC count (0.5; 95% CI = 0.3 to 0.7; p < 0.05).

Conclusions

In elder ED patients, a PCT level of 0.2 ng/mL is sensitive for bacteremia and, based on its negative likelihood ratio, is moderately helpful in ruling out the diagnosis. WBC count with or without left shift performed poorly in the diagnosis of bacteremia.

### Development and internal validation of a neonatal healthcare-associated infectiOn prediction score (neoHoP score) for very low birthweight infants in low-resource settings: a retrospective case-control study [^d49bb343]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2023). High credibility.

Results

Description of the study population

During the study period, 731 VLBW infants were investigated for 1694 separate episodes of clinically suspected HAI. Of these, 578 episodes were excluded based on incomplete records. The remaining 1116 clinically suspected HAI episodes occurred in 655 VLBW infants, in which 670 (60.0%) HAIs were considered excluded and 446 (40.0%) in which any HAI was diagnosed as per the study definitions (figure 1). Both cohorts had similar demographics based on the first episode of infection (table 1). There were 113 and 109 episodes of proven HAI (blood culture positive) in the derivation and validation cohorts, respectively. Gram negative organisms were responsible for the majority of blood culture positive HAI in both cohorts (46.9% (53/113) in derivation cohort, and 51.4% (56/109) in the validation cohort; p 0.696.

Comparison of baseline characteristics and pathogen distribution of the derivation and validation cohort

Development of the IPS

The derivation cohort included 564 episodes from 412 VLBW infants investigated for HAI, of which 333 (59.0%) had no HAI and 231 (41.0%) had any HAI. A total of 36 variables (7 maternal and labour risk factors, 4 neonatal characteristics, 14 clinical variables, 3 interventions and 8 laboratory variables— online supplemental table 1) were included in the initial univariate analysis comparing infants with no HAI to those with any HAI. The following 15 variables achieved a p<0.1 favouring any HAI: delivery outside of a tertiary facility, mottled skin, prolonged capillary refill time (CRT) >3 s, lethargy, glucose instability, abdominal distention, total parenteral nutrition (TPN), presence of a central venous catheter (CVC), a raised CRP, raised absolute neutrophil count, raised neutrophil percentage, lower platelet count, presence of toxic granulation and left shift (increased immature white cells) (online supplemental table 1). Increased respiratory rate and macroscopic blood in stool achieved p values of<0.1, favouring no HAI.

### Filgrastim-txid (Nypozi) [^899034b3]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

In phase 1 studies involving 96 patients with various nonmyeloid malignancies‚ administration of filgrastim resulted in a dose-dependent increase in circulating neutrophil counts over the dose range of 1 to 70 mcg/kg/day. This increase in neutrophil counts was observed whether filgrastim was administered intravenous (1 to 70 mcg/kg twice daily), subcutaneous (1 to 3 mcg/kg once daily)‚ or by continuous subcutaneous infusion (3 to 11 mcg/kg/day). With discontinuation of filgrastim therapy‚ neutrophil counts returned to baseline in most cases within 4 days. Isolated neutrophils displayed normal phagocytic (measured by zymosan-stimulated chemoluminescence) and chemotactic (measured by migration under agarose using N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine [fMLP] as the chemotaxin) activity in vitro .

The absolute monocyte count was reported to increase in a dose-dependent manner in most patients receiving filgrastim; however, the percentage of monocytes in the differential count remained within the normal range. Absolute counts of both eosinophils and basophils did not change and were within the normal range following administration of filgrastim. Increases in lymphocyte counts following filgrastim administration have been reported in some normal subjects and patients with cancer.

White blood cell (WBC) differentials obtained during clinical trials have demonstrated a shift towards earlier granulocyte progenitor cells (left shift), including the appearance of promyelocytes and myeloblasts‚ usually during neutrophil recovery following the chemotherapy-induced nadir. In addition‚ Dohle bodies‚ increased granulocyte granulation‚ and hypersegmented neutrophils have been observed. Such changes were transient and were not associated with clinical sequelae, nor were they necessarily associated with infection.

### Monocyte distribution width: a novel indicator of sepsis-2 and sepsis-3 in high-risk emergency department patients [^32ef9dd2]. Critical Care Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

The concept of monitoring changes in the morphology of circulating immune cells as an early sign of infection has been previously recognized. In response to microbial “danger signals” (e.g. bacterial endotoxins), circulating immune cells, particularly monocytes, and neutrophils are rapidly activated, as reflected by changes in their size and shape and the release of chemokines and cytokines in order to, respectively, recruit and activate other immune cells. Another possible explanation is that sepsis provokes the release of larger, immature monocytes (e.g. monoblasts) into the circulation. Regardless of the mechanism, increased immune cell size during severe infections likely precedes the onset of SIRS, as indicated by the observation that elevated MDW predicted progression from infection at ED admission to Sepsis-3 within 72 hours 71% of the time.

The MDW biomarker is predicted to provide added value to current sepsis detection protocols. A CBC with differential is routinely obtained in most patients presenting to the ED to screen for acute illness and guide the clinician while generating a differential diagnosis, including decisions to pursue a diagnosis of sepsis. The WBC serves as a current laboratory standard for the initial detection of severe infections, wherein an abnormal WBC is ~88% sensitive for sepsis detection, but its specificity for sepsis detection is low. In this study, it was shown that MDW enhanced the performance of WBC for early sepsis detection based on the following three different statistical approaches: 1) differences in the AUC, 2) probability and likelihood ratios, and 3) a statistical “added value analysis.” In contrast to currently available biomarkers of sepsis, such as procalcitonin, C-reactive protein, and lactic acid, which are typically used to confirm the presence of sepsis after the initial patient encounter in the ED, the MDW could be automatically reported with the CBC and differential to serve as means of sepsis detection during the initial ED encounter.

### A case of primary meningococcal pericarditis caused by Neisseria meningitidis serotype Y with rapid evolution into cardiac tamponade [^55846983]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Primary meningococcal pericarditis (PMP) is a rare form of acute purulent pericarditis that often evolves into cardiac tamponade and usually requires pericardial drainage. PMP is a rare, difficult to diagnose, rapidly progressive form of meningococcal infections. PMP is typically caused by Neisseria meningitidis of serotype C, or, less commonly, B or W135. We report the second case of PMP caused by Neisseria meningitidis of serotype Y. Our patient was not critically ill at presentation, and her presentation could have been consistent with viral uncomplicated pericarditis with the exception of the mild leukocytosis with a left shift in the differential. Clinicians should be aware that early in the course of PMP, the illness may not be severe. Mild leukocytosis with a left shift or bandemia in the setting of what otherwise seems to be a case of uncomplicated viral pericarditis should prompt suspicion for PMP and further evaluation and/or monitoring.

### Characterization and trajectories of hematological parameters prior to severe COVID-19 based on a large-scale prospective health checkup cohort in Western China: a longitudinal study of 13-year follow-up [^05a4b975]. BMC Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The relaxation of the “zero-COVID” policy on Dec. 7, 2022, in China posed a major public health threat recently. Complete blood count test was discovered to have complicated relationships with COVID-19 after the infection, while very few studies could track long-term monitoring of the health status and identify the characterization of hematological parameters prior to COVID-19.

Methods

Based on a 13-year longitudinal prospective health checkup cohort of ~ 480,000 participants in West China Hospital, the largest medical center in western China, we documented 998 participants with a laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 during the 1 month after the policy. We performed a time-to-event analysis to explore the associations of severe COVID-19 patients diagnosed, with 34 different hematological parameters at the baseline level prior to COVID-19, including the whole and the subtypes of white and red blood cells.

Results

A total of 998 participants with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test were documented in the cohort, 42 of which were severe cases. For white blood cell-related parameters, a higher level of basophil percentage (HR = 6.164, 95% CI = 2.066–18.393, P = 0.001) and monocyte percentage (HR = 1.283, 95% CI = 1.046–1.573, P = 0.017) were found associated with the severe COVID-19. For lymphocyte-related parameters, a lower level of lymphocyte count (HR = 0.571, 95% CI = 0.341–0.955, P = 0.033), and a higher CD4/CD8 ratio (HR = 2.473, 95% CI = 1.009–6.059, P = 0.048) were found related to the risk of severe COVID-19. We also observed that abnormality of red cell distribution width (RDW), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), and hemoglobin might also be involved in the development of severe COVID-19. The different trajectory patterns of RDW-SD and white blood cell count, including lymphocyte and neutrophil, prior to the infection were also discovered to have significant associations with the risk of severe COVID-19 (all P < 0.05).

Conclusions

Our findings might help decision-makers and clinicians to classify different risk groups of population due to outbreaks including COVID-19. They could not only optimize the allocation of medical resources, but also help them be more proactive instead of reactive to long COVID-19 or even other outbreaks in the future.

### When leucocytosis is not leukaemia [^2c03666f]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

A female aged 84 years with a history of Clostridium difficile -associated diarrhoea presented from an extended care facility with altered mental status and respiratory distress. She was haemodynamically unstable and initial laboratory results revealed hyperleucocytosis (110.3×10 9 /L). The presence of immature myeloid precursors, thrombocytopenia and respiratory distress, raised concern for an acute leukaemic process requiring emergent leucapheresis. However, on evaluation of the peripheral smear, prominent left shift and toxic granulation were noted, along with absence of blast cells. Considering her history of C. difficile infection, a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis was obtained, which was suggestive of toxic megacolon. She was taken to the operating room for emergent colectomy. The pathology specimen showed pseudomembrane formation consistent with fulminant C. difficile infection. She was treated with oral vancomycin and intravenous metronidazole, followed by clinical improvement and resolution of leucocytosis and thrombocytopenia.

### Glucosuria as an early marker of late-onset sepsis in preterms: a prospective cohort study [^5103af7e]. BMC Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Definitions

A change in glucosuria was defined as an increase of at least one category; category 1+ and 2++ were pooled since we previously showed that these categories cannot be reliably distinguished, because the glucosuria ranges in these two categories overlap.

An episode of suspected sepsis was defined as a clinical suspicion by the attending neonatologist. At the onset of each episode, data on clinical signs were assessed in a standardised way, i.e. the physician completed a form with clinical signs on which the suspicion of LONS was based. In addition, routine laboratory investigations, including blood cultures, C-reactive protein (CRP) and full blood count were performed. We only included the first episode of suspected LONS.

The outcome of each episode was classified in 3 mutually exclusive categories: blood-culture proven sepsis, clinical (blood-culture negative) sepsis and rejected sepsis. The classification was made by the researchers based on the course of the episode after the start of antibiotics, using the following predefined definitions of LONS. Blood-culture proven sepsis was defined as an episode with positive non-contaminated blood-culture. A positive blood-culture with organisms regarded as commensals (predominantly Coagulase-negative Staphylococcus) was defined as contamination. However a positive blood culture with skin commensals was defined as proven sepsis when the same organism was found in at least two blood cultures and/or signs of catheter-related sepsis were present, such as inflammation of the skin at the site of line insertion. Clinical sepsis was defined as strong clinical suspicion of sepsis as defined by the attending neonatologist or raised CRP during the first 3 days after the onset of suspected infection (>10 mg/l) or positive haematological markers (leukopenia ≤ 5 x 10 9 /l, leucocytosis ≥ 25 x 10 9 /l, or left shift of the differential count), despite a negative blood culture. Rejected sepsis was defined as an episode with negative blood culture (plus CRP <10 mg/l and negative haematological markers) or an episode in which no blood culture was performed and no antibiotics were started. In all our analyses and results, LONS was defined as blood-culture proven and/or clinical sepsis, unless stated otherwise.

### Monocyte distribution width: a novel indicator of sepsis-2 and sepsis-3 in high-risk emergency department patients [^4261408e]. Critical Care Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

This multicenter clinical trial validated the results of a recent single-site feasibility trial that were further developed in a multisite pilot study (see Digital Supplement, Supplemental Digital Content 1,) demonstrating that the MDW alone was effective for the early detection of sepsis in the ED regardless of the diagnostic sepsis criteria used. Early detection has important implications for the initiation of standardized sepsis care bundles, wherein strong correlations exist between delayed treatment and higher mortality. This study further showed that incorporation of MDW into clinical decision making would likely enhance the clinical utility of the WBC and other SIRS criteria for early sepsis detection in the ED based on statistical decision curve analyses.

Relative to the prior feasibility study, which was inclusive of all ED patients, this study was enriched for ED patients with greater acute illness severity, as reflected by admission to the ED and/or hospital for at least 12 hours after initial CBC testing. This aspect of the study design was necessary for the proper classification of sepsis in all study subjects and explains the relatively high prevalence of sepsis (17.8%) in this trial compared with prior ED sepsis studies. Given that most sepsis patients benefit from hospital admission for the delivery of standardized care and many patients who were initially characterized as infected, nonseptic subsequently progressed to sepsis, we submit that this ED patient subpopulation was most appropriate for sepsis biomarker evaluation.

The guiding principle during the development of sepsis diagnostic criteria is to identify reliable and convenient variables by which potentially life-threatening infections are readily detected in the clinical setting. The foundation of all sepsis definitions, from Sepsis-1 to Sepsis-3, rests on the activation of the host’s immune response during the transition from a localized inflammatory response to a systemic immune response, as indicated by the mobilization of circulating immune cells (elevated WBC) and clinical manifestations, such as hyperthermia, tachycardia, and tachypnea, comprising the SIRS criteria. SIRS reflects the systemic release of proinflammatory cytokines regulating the host’s immune response to pathogens. Unfortunately, SIRS is a manifestation of many other acute noninfectious illnesses confronted in the ED setting. Indeed, in this trial, the prevalence of sepsis-related SIRS was equivalent to other noninfectious causes of SIRS in the ED population. Thus, SIRS criteria are of limited value for sepsis detection due to poor specificity.

### Paliperidone palmitate (Invega SUSTENNA) [^bbec3469]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.9 Leukopenia, Neutropenia, and Agranulocytosis

In clinical trial and/or postmarketing experience, events of leukopenia and neutropenia have been reported temporally related to antipsychotic agents, including INVEGA SUSTENNA. Agranulocytosis has also been reported.

Possible risk factors for leukopenia/neutropenia include pre-existing low white blood cell count (WBC)/absolute neutrophil count (ANC) and history of drug-induced leukopenia/neutropenia. In patients with a history of a clinically significant low WBC/ANC or a drug-induced leukopenia/neutropenia, perform a complete blood count (CBC) frequently during the first few months of therapy. In such patients, consider discontinuation of INVEGA SUSTENNA at the first sign of a clinically significant decline in WBC in the absence of other causative factors.

Monitor patients with clinically significant neutropenia for fever or other symptoms or signs of infection and treat promptly if such symptoms or signs occur. Discontinue INVEGA SUSTENNA in patients with severe neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count < 1000/mm3) and follow their WBC until recovery.

### Eosinophilia predicts poor clinical outcomes in recent-onset arthritis: results from the ESPOIR cohort [^43c7157c]. RMD Open (2015). Low credibility.

Significance and innovations

Eosinophilia is rare in recent-onset arthritis suggestive of rheumatoid arthritis, and is usually directly related to the joint disease.
Mild eosinophilia at diagnosis of recent-onset arthritis is a marker of poor response to the treatment.

A complete blood count (CBC) is performed routinely during the initial work up for early inflammatory arthritis, as the results may provide valuable information on the cause of arthritis as well as on any comorbidities. An eosinophil count ≥500/mm 3 is considered abnormal. The most common causes of peripheral-blood eosinophilia are atopic syndrome in industrialised countries and helminth infections worldwide.Other causes include various infections, tumours, dysimmune disorders and drugs. Idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome is a very uncommon cause of eosinophilia, generally characterised by sustained eosinophilia and end-organ involvement.

Peripheral-blood eosinophilia is uncommon in rheumatic diseases but may occur in dermatomyositis, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), progressive systemic sclerosis and Sjögren's syndrome.Differential diagnoses in patients with RA and eosinophilia include concomitant vasculitis and hypersensitivity reactions to therapeutic agents.Few studies have addressed the prevalence and significance of eosinophilia in inflammatory joint disease. A few early studies in RA suggested that eosinophilia might predict greater disease severity but suffered from a number of drawbacks such as small sample size, selection bias and use of relative values instead of absolute values to define eosinophilia.Most of the recent studies in patients with RA or a variety of rheumatic diseases found no evidence that eosinophilia was associated with disease severity or complications. However, the patients in these studies did not have recent-onset disease, and were not naive to corticosteroids or disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs).

Thus, two important questions remain unanswered. One is whether eosinophilia in a patient with recent-onset arthritis is related to the joint disease or should prompt investigations for another cause. The other is whether eosinophilia predicts the outcome of the joint disease.

We conducted a study designed to answer these two questions. Our primary objective was to determine the prevalence of eosinophilia in patients with recent-onset arthritis, suggestive of RA or consistent with RA. Our secondary objectives were to delineate the features of patients with eosinophilia at baseline, and 3 years later, particularly their treatments, comorbidities and final diagnoses; and to determine whether baseline eosinophilia predicted subsequent disease activity, disease severity, the development of extra-articular manifestations including vasculitis and/or comorbidities.

### Leukocytosis in infection (...) [^6b6a78bf]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

To the Editor. —The presence of infection in man is often associated with leukocytosis in the peripheral blood. This phenomenon is most likely associated with acute bacterial infections, although it may be seen with nonbacterial acute infection and, occasionally, with chronic infections. It is also common knowledge that there is a so-called shift to the left with the number of bilobe and monolobe leukocytes increasing at the expense of those with more lobes. The amount of shift is proportional to the severity of the toxemia. Schilling, in 1929, 1 outlined the course of events in acute infection with a favorable outcome being related to leukocytosis with a shift to the left and disappearance of eosinophils and basophils and, later, a reduction in lymphocyte and monocyte counts. In Wintrobe's Clinical Hematology, published in 1942, 3 he relates the cause of neutrophilia to pyogenic bacteria, particularly cocci, but this was also noted. Zubler MA. Leukocytosis in Infection.

### Routine laboratory testing to determine if a patient has COVID-19 [^0ace240c]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Clinical pathway

Decisions about patient and isolation pathways for COVID‐19 vary according to health services and settings, available resources, and stages of the epidemic. They will change over time if and when effective treatments and vaccines are identified. The decision points between these pathways vary, but all include points at which knowledge of the accuracy of diagnostic information is needed to be able to inform rational decisions.

Standard workup for individuals suspected of COVID‐19 infection consists of assessing signs and symptoms and a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test. It is common practice that, when patients enter (either outpatient or admission) the hospital, they will generally have routine laboratory tests done.

Routinely available tests for infection and inflammation may be considered in the investigation of people with possible COVID‐19 infection. For example, many healthcare facilities have access to standard laboratory tests for infection, such as CRP, procalcitonin, measures of anticoagulation, and white blood cell count with leukocyte differentiation. Routine laboratory markers may be used as a triage test, either on their own, or in combination with signs and symptoms. In low‐resource settings, they may sometimes even be the only tests available. In order to function as a triage test or stand‐alone test, a high sensitivity is needed, to prevent infected patients from being sent home or into a general ward with uninfected patients. For a triage test, specificity may be less important, as positive tests will be further investigated. Also, routine laboratory tests may be used to tip the decision to treat the patient as having COVID‐19 or not in case of mixed results from other tests or where a definite diagnosis cannot be made. In that case, knowledge of the sensitivity and specificity in a particular (pre‐tested) patient population may be useful. Routine laboratory tests may also be used in the further diagnostic workup, to predict mild versus severe outcomes, or to monitor treatment response. These aims of testing will not be the focus of this systematic review.

### Accuracy of routine laboratory tests to predict mortality and deterioration to severe or critical COVID-19 in people with SARS-CoV-2 [^b9d82f73]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

White blood cell count decrease

White blood cell count decrease was assessed for the target conditions: mortality, and deterioration.

For mortality (5 studies), four studies used a cut‐off value of 4 x 10 9 cells/L, and one study used 5.025 x 10 9 cells/L as the cut‐off value. Sensitivity ranged from 0% to 40%, and specificity from 39% to 97%. At a fixed specificity of 68% (Q1), 83% (median), and 87% (Q3), the summary estimates of sensitivity were 9% (95% CI 6% to 14%), 9% (95% CI 6% to 14%), and 9% (95% CI 6% to 14%), respectively.

For deterioration (6 studies), the cut‐off values ranged from 3.5 to 4 x 10 9 cells/L. Sensitivity ranged from 0% to 43%; two studies reported a sensitivity of 0%. Specificity ranged from 37% to 91%. Meta‐analysis yielded a sensitivity of 15% (95% CI 6% to 33%), 12% (95% CI 5% to 26%) and 8% (95% CI /) at a fixed specificity of 83% (Q1), 85% (median) and 88% (Q3), respectively.

For deterioration (5 studies), cut‐off values to define neutrophil count increase ranged between 4.7 and 10 x 10 9 cells/L. Sensitivity ranged from 17% to 62%, and specificity from 70% to 93%. The median specificity in these studies was 89% with an IQR from 88% to 93%. The summary estimates of sensitivity corresponding to these numbers were: 62% (95% CI 46% to 75%) at a specificity of 88%, 49% (95% CI 37% to 62%) at a specificity of 89%, and 41% (95% CI 28% to 55%) at a specificity of 93%.

### Management of neonates born at ≥ 35 0 / 7 weeks' gestation with suspected or proven early-onset bacterial sepsis [^a67df3e0]. Pediatrics (2018). Medium credibility.

White blood cell indices—diagnostic performance in EOS: The white blood cell (WBC) count, immature/total neutrophil ratio (I/T), and absolute neutrophil count (ANC) are commonly used to assess the risk of EOS, but in 2 large, multicenter studies among term and late-preterm infants none of the components (WBC count, I/T, nor ANC) performed well. Multiple clinical factors can affect the WBC count and differential, and as the incidence of EOS declines, the clinical utility of the WBC count also declines. Extreme values—total WBC count <5000 /μL [I/T >0.3; ANC <2000/μL] in one study and WBC count <10000/μL [ANC <1000/μL; and I/T >0.5] in the other—were associated with the highest likelihood ratios but very low sensitivities. WBC count >20 000/μL and platelet counts were not associated with EOS in either study, and the I/T squared [I/T divided by the ANC] performed better than any of the more traditional tests and was independent of age in hours.

### Haloperidol decanoate (Haldol decanoate) [^c25ea429]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Leukopenia, Neutropenia, and Agranulocytosis

Class Effect: In clinical trial and/or postmarketing experience, events of leukopenia/neutropenia have been reported temporally related to antipsychotic agents, including HALDOL decanoate. Agranulocytosis has also been reported.

Possible risk factors for leukopenia/neutropenia include pre-existing low white blood cell count (WBC) and history of drug-induced leukopenia/neutropenia. Patients with a history of a clinically significant low WBC or a drug-induced leukopenia/neutropenia should have their complete blood count (CBC) monitored frequently during the first few months of therapy and discontinuation of HALDOL decanoate should be considered at the first sign of a clinically significant decline in WBC in the absence of other causative factors.

Patients with clinically significant neutropenia should be carefully monitored for fever or other symptoms or signs of infection and treated promptly if such symptoms or signs occur. Patients with severe neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count <1000/mm3) should discontinue HALDOL decanoate and have their WBC followed until recovery.

### Manual differential cell counts help predict bacterial infection. A multivariate analysis [^e095a6cf]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2001). Low credibility.

We developed logistic regression models that combine information from the automated CBC and manual 100-cell differential counts to predict bacterial infection. The logistic models were fitted from a case group of 116 patients with proven bacterial infection and a control group of 930 presumably uninfected outpatients. A 4-variable, 15-parameter model, which includes automated absolute neutrophil, manual band, and manual immature granulocyte counts, performed best with a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve area of 89%. A more practical 2-variable model including automated absolute neutrophil and manual band counts performed almost as well with an ROC curve area of 86%. The automated neutrophil count-only model is less informative with an ROC curve area of 78%. The combined information from automated and manual differential cell counts more accurately predicts bacterial infection than automated counting alone. Despite these modest improvements, the high cost of manual differential cell counts dictates careful patient selection. The supplemental information gained from manual differential counts is most useful for patients with low to normal neutrophil counts (8,000/microL [8.0 x 10(9)/L] or less). Further studies are indicated to determine the characteristic patient populations deriving maximal benefit from this information.

### ASRA pain medicine consensus practice infection control guidelines for regional anesthesia and pain medicine [^3ff75e3e]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Postprocedural recommendations for reducing surgical site infections (SSIs)—In patients with suspected SSI, complete blood count (CBC) with differential, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and C-reactive protein (CRP) should be obtained and monitored for trends; CRP is a more reliable biomarker for acute SSI than ESR, and blood cultures should be considered in suspected sepsis or signs of illness. For SSIs requiring surgical debridement, irrigation, revision, or explantation, intraoperative cultures should be obtained, ideally including tissue; complicated SSIs involving neuraxial structures should be investigated with advanced imaging (e.g., MRI when MRI conditionality is appropriate), and a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) evaluation should be conducted if meningeal signs are present. Complete system explantation should be considered for device-related SSI, particularly for deep (subfascial) and/or complicated device-related SSI; high-volume, low-pressure irrigation with normal saline following debridement of necrotic tissue is recommended; and antibiotic therapy should be guided by preoperative or intraoperative culture results whenever possible. A trial of oral antibiotics may be considered for superficial SSI with close clinical monitoring, is typically offered for 7–10 days, and should include an agent with activity against staphylococcal and streptococcal species. Consider consultation with an infectious diseases specialist if reimplantation is being considered, and a minimum 12-week interval is recommended prior to reimplantation in appropriate candidates following explantation for a device-related infection; reimplantation at a site not involved in SSI should be considered. Educate patient and family on proper incision care, symptoms of SSI, and the importance of reporting symptoms.

### The definition of anemia: what is the lower limit of normal of the blood hemoglobin concentration? [^126f9c5e]. Blood (2006). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of anemia is an important aspect of the practice of hematology. The first step is to decide whether the patient is, in fact, anemic. Unless earlier blood counts are available, and they often are not, the physician must make his or her decision on the basis of the population distribution of hemoglobin values. How likely is it that the patient's hemoglobin value lies below the normal distribution; that is, "the lower limit"?

### Defining and diagnosing sepsis [^53f07bac]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Sepsis is a heterogeneous clinical syndrome that encompasses infections of many different types and severity. Not surprisingly, it has confounded most attempts to apply a single definition, which has also limited the ability to develop a set of reliable diagnostic criteria. It is perhaps best defined as the different clinical syndromes produced by an immune response to infection that causes harm to the body beyond that of the local effects of the infection.

### Failure to normalize lymphopenia following trauma is associated with increased mortality, independent of the leukocytosis pattern [^5ea6b421]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Following trauma and systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), the typical response is an elevation of the total complete blood count (CBC) and a reduction of the lymphocyte count. This leukocytosis typically returns to normal within 48 hours. The persistence of a leukocytosis following trauma is associated with adverse outcomes. Although lymphocyte anergy and dysfunction following trauma is associated with increased risk for infection and sepsis, there is a paucity of data regarding the impact of a persistence of a low lymphocyte count in trauma patients.

Methods

This is a retrospective review of prospectively collected data from trauma patients collected over the 5 years of September 2003 to September 2008. Patients were included if the injury severity score (ISS) was >or=15, and they survived at least 3 days. Demographic data, mechanism and injury severity score, mortality, and length of stay were collected from the medical record. Laboratory values for the first 4 hospital days were collected. Leukocyte, neutrophil and lymphocyte counts were extracted from the daily complete blood count (CBC). Patients were then grouped based on response (elevation/depression) of each component of the CBC, and their return, or failure thereof, to normal. Proportional hazards regression with time-varying covariates as well as Kaplan-Meier curves were used to predict risk of death, time to death and time to healthy discharge based on fluctuations of the individual components of the CBC.

Results

There were 2448 patients admitted over the 5 years included in the analysis. When adjusting for age, gender and ISS the relative risk of death was elevated with a persistent leukocytosis (2.501 (95% CI=1.477-4.235)) or failure to normalize lymphopenia (1.639 (95% CI=10.17-2.643)) within the first 4 days following admission. Similar results were seen when Kaplan-Meier curves were created. Persistent lymphopenia was associated with shortest time to death. Paradoxically in survivors persistent lymphopenia was associated with the shortest time to discharge.

Conclusions

Persistently abnormal CBC responses are associated with a higher mortality following trauma. This is the first report noting that a failure to normalize lymphopenia in severely injured patients is associated with significantly higher mortality.

### Lumateperone (Caplyta) [^2e0d2c6a]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

In an uncontrolled open-label trial of CAPLYTA for up to 6 months in patients with bipolar depression, the proportion of patients with a shift from normal to high were 10%, 5%, and 2% for total cholesterol, triglycerides, and LDL cholesterol, respectively.

Weight Gain

Weight gain has been observed with use of antipsychotics. Monitor weight at baseline and frequently thereafter.

Schizophrenia

In pooled data from placebo-controlled trials of adult patients with schizophrenia, mean changes from baseline and the proportion of patients with an increase in weight ≥7% from baseline to end of study was similar in patients treated with CAPLYTA and placebo.

In an uncontrolled open-label trial of CAPLYTA for up to 1 year in patients with stable schizophrenia, the mean change in body weight was approximately -2 kg (SD 5.6) at Day 175 and approximately - 3.2 kg (SD 7.4) at Day 350.

Bipolar Depression

In data from short-term (6-week), placebo-controlled monotherapy and adjunctive therapy bipolar depression trials, mean changes from baseline and the proportion of patients with an increase in weight ≥7% from baseline to end of study were similar in patients treated with CAPLYTA and placebo.

In an uncontrolled open-label trial of CAPLYTA for up to 6 months in patients with bipolar depression, the mean change in body weight was -0.01 kg (SD 3.1) at Day 175.

5.7 Leukopenia,
Neutropenia, and Agranulocytosis

Leukopenia and neutropenia have been reported during treatment with antipsychotic agents, including CAPLYTA. Agranulocytosis (including fatal cases) has been reported with other agents in the class.

Possible risk factors for leukopenia and neutropenia include pre-existing low white blood cell count (WBC) or absolute neutrophil count (ANC) and history of drug-induced leukopenia or neutropenia. In patients with a pre-existing low WBC or ANC or a history of drug-induced leukopenia or neutropenia, perform a complete blood count (CBC) frequently during the first few months of therapy. In such patients, consider discontinuation of CAPLYTA at the first sign of a clinically significant decline in WBC in the absence of other causative factors.

Monitor patients with clinically significant neutropenia for fever or other symptoms or signs of infection and treat promptly if such symptoms or signs occur. Discontinue CAPLYTA in patients with absolute neutrophil count < 1000/mm3and follow their WBC until recovery.

### The intensive care infection score-a novel marker for the prediction of infection and its severity [^76039750]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Infection is probable or can be proven in approximately 50 % of critically ill patients with suspected infection. This could lead potentially to overtreatment with empiric antibiotics. Moreover, infection diagnostics are often delayed because it takes 48 h at the minimum for cultures to become positive and thereby to prove a clinically suspected infection. Hence, there is a continuing need for fast and accurate biomarkers of infection, which may help to predict infection, its invasiveness and severity, and may guide empiric antibiotic treatment in the future. We believe that prediction of infection is more helpful in patient management than prediction of sepsis, because the majority of critically ill patients have two or more criteria of the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) as criteria for sepsis, irrespective of infection.

Commonly applied biomarkers include C-reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin (PCT), but predictive values vary among studies. A new biomarker is the intensive care infection score (ICIS), which is composed of five blood-cell-derived parameters characterizing the early innate immune response and is routinely obtainable in blood samples sent to the laboratory for cell counts. The ICIS has been retrospectively evaluated in two pilot studies of 70 and 172 patients, respectively, suggesting it has potential predictive value for infection.

We therefore performed a prospective study on the predictive value of ICIS for probable or proven infection in critically ill patients with suspected infection, and compared its performance with that of the white blood cell count (WBC), CRP and PCT levels. We hypothesized that in the critically ill patient with suspected infection the diagnostic accuracy of the simply obtainable ICIS is at least equivalent in this respect to WBC, CRP and PCT, without requiring extra blood sampling.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines on the treatment and management of patients with COVID-19 (September 2022) [^9b04ea81]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

IDSA COVID-19 guideline—laboratory markers and antibiotic stewardship: the use of procalcitonin in a group of hospitals was not effective as a tool to encourage antibiotic discontinuation compared to clinical judgment. Mason and colleagues compared hospitalized cohorts of 619 patients with COVID-19 and 106 with community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP) and found marked differences in white blood cell counts (6.78 COVID-19 vs. 12.48 CABP) and that CRP declined in 48-72 hours with antibiotic therapy in the CABP cohort but not the COVID-19 group, suggesting these findings can guide discontinuation when antibiotics are initiated empirically in COVID-19. Initiating and continuing empiric antibiotics at admission may lead to resistant superinfections; one study found antibiotic use in the first two days of admission for COVID-19 to be a risk factor for superinfection. Immunomodulatory therapies are recommended for many patients with severe and critical illness from COVID-19, including corticosteroids, IL-6 antagonists, and JAK inhibitors.

### Paliperidone palmitate (erzofri extended-release) [^e4d98d0e]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.9	Leukopenia, Neutropenia, and Agranulocytosis

In clinical trial and/or postmarketing experience, events of leukopenia and neutropenia have been reported temporally related to antipsychotic agents, including once-a-month paliperidone palmitate extended-release injectable suspension (PP1M). Agranulocytosis has also been reported.

Possible risk factors for leukopenia/neutropenia include pre-existing low white blood cell count (WBC)/absolute neutrophil count (ANC) and history of drug-induced leukopenia/neutropenia. In patients with a history of a clinically significant low WBC/ANC or a drug-induced leukopenia/neutropenia, perform a complete blood count (CBC) frequently during the first few months of therapy. In such patients, consider discontinuation of ERZOFRI at the first sign of a clinically significant decline in WBC in the absence of other causative factors.

Monitor patients with clinically significant neutropenia for fever or other symptoms or signs of infection and treat promptly if such symptoms or signs occur. Discontinue ERZOFRI in patients with severe neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count < 1000/mm3) and follow their WBC until recovery.

### Acquired and reversible pelger-HuëT anomaly of polymorphonuclear neutrophils in three transplant patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil therapy [^c3c0ca63]. American Journal of Hematology (2003). Low credibility.

Deficient nuclear segmentation and abnormal chromatin condensation define Pelger-Huët anomaly of polymorphonuclear neutrophils. Next to the hereditary irreversible form, acquired forms both reversible and irreversible have been described. We describe three transplant patients who were all investigated for a left shift in the absence of symptoms or signs of infection and in whom acquired reversible Pelger-Huët anomaly was discovered. The abnormal PMN phenotype was induced by mycophenolate mofetil (MMF). MMF is a necessary but not sufficient condition for the development of the anomaly. In our three patients a dose-response effect was observed regarding plasma MMF concentration and severity of neutrophil dysplasia. Except for one slightly elevated value, the patients' plasma MMF levels were within the therapeutic range. None of the patients, one who was neutropenic at presentation and two who were non-neutropenic, developed infectious complications. From our three cases as well as those of other authors, we identify previous graft rejection episodes as a potential predisposing factor for the development of PHA. In the first patient, drug withdrawal led to normalization of PMN morphology. In the other two patients, the left shift disappeared after dose reduction. In these latter two patients, a form of desensitization to the effect of MMF on neutro- phils was observed following re-augmentation of MMF dose.

### Clinical characteristics and prognostic marker for hospitalization in children with influenza infection in an emergency setting [^f7c69f7b]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Influenza remains to be a serious concern in the context of public health, characterized by unanticipated outbreaks and pandemics. This is particularly evident in the pediatric population, where it leads to substantial morbidity and mortality on an annual basis. Influenza infection results in a diverse array of clinical symptoms, the most of which are not severe and may be managed on an outpatient basis. However, particular children, especially those with pre-existing chronic medical conditions, might require hospitalization. Hence, there is a pressing need to implement measures aimed at reducing the morbidity and fatality rates related with influenza, particularly among the pediatric population. Identifying children with influenza who may need hospitalization may lead to better influenza outcomes. Several clinical findings, such as elevated respiratory and heart rate, can assist physicians in identifying and prognosticating the extent of influenza infection in pediatric patients. Laboratory investigations, such as the complete blood count, are frequently used to assess and define the severity of infections. However, no distinct laboratory pattern has been shown to be specifically linked to the severity of influenza. The objective of this study was to identify factors associated with the severity of influenza infection, especially among children who were admitted to the hospital after being diagnosed with influenza in the emergency department.

### Society of Family Planning guidelines: postplacental insertion of intrauterine devices [^52ed5370]. Contraception (2018). Medium credibility.

Postplacental intrauterine device (IUD) safety—perforation, infection, and bleeding: Postplacental IUD insertion has risks similar to insertion at other time points, with perforation rare in a prospective study of 8343 women that documented only one perforation after 460 postplacental insertions (0.2%), a risk not greater than insertion more than 6 months postpartum. Risk of infection after postplacental insertion is low, including no difference in clinical endometritis at 10 days postpartum between acceptors and non-acceptors (3% vs. 5%) and identical leukocyte left-shift rates (16% in both groups). Vaginal bleeding does not appear to be increased; in 191 cesarean deliveries, mean bleeding duration was 27 days vs. 33 days vs. 20 days for control, Nova-T, and LNG-IUD groups, respectively, with no difference in postpartum day 1 hemoglobin (11.2 g/dL vs. 11.1 g/dL), the control group had higher puerperal sepsis (8% vs. 1%), and another trial reported no difference in hemoglobin at 10 days postpartum (11.9 g/dL in both groups).

### Clinical outcomes of ED patients with bandemia [^99a4f2fd]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Although an elevated white blood cell count is a widely utilized measure for evidence of infection and an important criterion for evaluation of systemic inflammatory response syndrome, its component band count occupies a more contested position within clinical emergency medicine. Recent studies indicate that bandemia is highly predictive of a serious infection, suggesting that clinicians who do not appreciate the value of band counts may delay diagnosis or overlook severe infections.

Objectives

Whereas previous studies focused on determining the quantitative value of the band count (ie, determining sensitivity, threshold for bandemia, etc.), this study directs attention to patient-centered outcomes, hypothesizing that the degree of bandemia predisposes patients to subsequent negative clinical outcomes associated with underappreciated severe infections.

Methods

This retrospective study of electronic medical records includes patients who initially presented to the emergency department (ED) with bandemia and were subsequently discharged from the ED. These patients were screened for repeat ED visits within 7 days and death within 30 days.

Results

In patients with severe bandemia who were discharged from the ED, there was a 20.9% revisit rate at 7 days and a 4.9% mortality rate at 30 days, placing severely bandemic patients at 5 times significantly greater mortality compared to nonbandemic patients (P = .032).

Conclusion

Our review of patient outcomes suggests that the degree of bandemia, especially in the setting of concurrent tachycardia or fever, is associated with greater likelihood of negative clinical outcomes.
