## Question

TSH .38

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to interpret and manage a TSH of 0.38 mIU/L. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about where 0.38 mIU/L sits relative to common reference intervals. Then, I should verify the clinical context and whether this is a first-time result or persistent. Next, I will check free T4 and consider free T3 or total T3 if indicated. After that, I need to review potential causes, including endogenous hyperthyroidism, medications, and non-thyroidal illness. Finally, I will align management with guideline thresholds, stratified by age and risk, and outline follow-up and special situations like pregnancy or thyroid nodules.

> Let me first confirm the magnitude and classification. A TSH of 0.38 mIU/L is just below the typical lower limit of normal (about 0.4–4.5 mIU/L), placing it in the "low but detectable" range rather than fully suppressed, which is consistent with mild or grade I subclinical hyperthyroidism if free T4 and T3 are normal [^115nFvNi] [^117McmWv] [^111trvZ4].

> Wait, let me verify persistence before labeling this as disease. I should repeat TSH in 3–6 months to confirm persistence because TSH has substantial biological and analytical variability, and a meaningful fraction of low TSH results revert to normal without intervention, especially in the 0.1–0.4 mIU/L band [^116vHLh6] [^114bqgrE] [^111kErfz].

> Next, I should review thyroid hormone levels to classify the pattern. I need a free T4, and if free T4 is normal and hyperthyroidism remains suspected clinically, I should add total T3 or free T3 to exclude T3-toxicosis; a normal free T4 with normal T3 alongside a TSH of 0.38 mIU/L supports subclinical hyperthyroidism rather than overt disease [^114Ub1fK] [^112AZiH6] [^114fiaqB].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about etiology yet. I will now examine potential causes: endogenous causes include Graves' disease, toxic nodular disease, or a solitary autonomous nodule. Exogenous causes include excess levothyroxine or liothyronine, amiodarone, interferon, or glucocorticoids. And transient causes include thyroiditis or non-thyroidal illness, which can suppress TSH temporarily, so I should correlate with symptoms, medications, and recent illness [^115EuM3S] [^1142XYF3] [^116uLLpr].

> I need to ensure I tailor management to age and comorbidities. For asymptomatic adults under 65 without cardiac disease or osteoporosis, observation with repeat TSH in 6–12 months is reasonable. For those 65 or older, or anyone with cardiac disease, arrhythmias, osteoporosis, or hyperthyroid symptoms, I should consider treatment if TSH is persistently below 0.1 mIU/L, and consider treatment in the 0.1–0.4 mIU/L range based on risk and patient preference. Symptomatic patients may benefit from a trial of beta-blockers while the workup proceeds [^117McmWv] [^114Zketr] [^112mMkjF] [^1158KfRZ].

> But wait, what if the patient is pregnant or planning pregnancy? In early pregnancy, TSH naturally falls and a value around 0.38 mIU/L can be physiologic; I should interpret using trimester-specific ranges and avoid overdiagnosis, reserving evaluation for overt hyperthyroid features or concerning symptoms [^114PrnPb] [^117PB58f] [^115cJYMZ].

> I should double-check for thyroid nodules or goiter on exam. If a nodule is present and TSH is subnormal, a radionuclide thyroid scan helps distinguish hyperfunctioning (autonomous) from nonfunctioning nodules, which alters malignancy risk and management; hyperfunctioning nodules rarely harbor cancer, whereas a higher TSH — even within the normal range — associates with higher malignancy risk [^116Dmdi7] [^115E8SMj].

> Let me consider the natural history to guide counseling. Progression from subclinical to overt hyperthyroidism is uncommon in the 0.1–0.4 mIU/L band, with higher progression when TSH is fully suppressed; still, a meaningful minority revert to normal over time, reinforcing the need to confirm persistence before committing to definitive therapy [^115tmv2A] [^112J8kY7] [^111kErfz].

> I should confirm assay and pre-analytic factors to avoid misclassification. TSH has notable intra-individual variability and can be influenced by medications and illness; if results are discordant with the clinical picture, I should repeat testing, consider alternative platforms, and keep the clinical context front and center to avoid overdiagnosis and overtreatment [^114bqgrE] [^11393xk4] [^112pWQ61].

> Putting this together for TSH 0.38 mIU/L, my plan is: repeat TSH in 3–6 months to confirm persistence. Obtain free T4 now and total T3 if free T4 is normal but suspicion persists. Review medications and symptoms. If persistent and the patient is under 65 without high-risk comorbidities, observe and recheck in 6–12 months. If 65 or older or with cardiac disease or osteoporosis, lower my threshold to treat, especially if TSH drops below 0.1 mIU/L. And if a nodule is present, add a thyroid scan to assess autonomy before deciding on further steps [^116vHLh6] [^117McmWv] [^116Dmdi7].

---

A TSH of 0.38 mIU/L is **borderline low** and most consistent with subclinical hyperthyroidism when free T4 and T3 are normal. Confirm with **repeat TSH** and free T4 in 3–6 months [^116vHLh6], and evaluate for symptoms, cardiac risk, osteoporosis, and medications (e.g. glucocorticoids, dopamine, amiodarone, interferon, thyroid hormone) [^117McmWv]. No treatment is needed if asymptomatic and low risk; consider therapy if TSH is persistently < 0.1 mIU/L [^112mMkjF], or if there are symptoms, cardiac disease, or osteoporosis [^117McmWv]. Management is individualized based on age, comorbidities, and persistence [^114Zketr].

---

## Clinical significance of TSH 0.38 mIU/L

A TSH of 0.38 mIU/L is **borderline low** — just below the typical lower limit of normal (0.4–4.0 mIU/L) — and most often reflects subclinical hyperthyroidism when free T4 and T3 are normal. It can also be seen with **transient TSH suppression** from non-thyroidal illness, medications, or assay variability [^114bqgrE].

---

## Possible causes of mildly suppressed TSH

Several factors can cause a **mildly suppressed TSH**:

- **Subclinical hyperthyroidism**: Persistent TSH < 0.4 mIU/L with normal free T4/T3 [^115nFvNi].
- **Medications**: Glucocorticoids, dopamine agonists, amiodarone, interferon, and exogenous thyroid hormone can suppress TSH [^notfound].
- **Non-thyroidal illness**: Acute illness can transiently suppress TSH [^116uLLpr].
- **Assay variability**: TSH assays vary; use lab-specific ranges [^11393xk4].

---

## Clinical implications and risks

Mildly suppressed TSH is associated with:

- **Cardiovascular risk**: Higher atrial fibrillation and cardiovascular mortality, especially in older adults [^115XH3rG].
- **Bone health**: Increased osteoporosis and fracture risk, particularly in postmenopausal women [^113dZPzQ].
- **Progression**: Small risk of progression to overt hyperthyroidism [^115tmv2A].

---

## Recommended clinical evaluation

When TSH is 0.38 mIU/L, the following **evaluation is recommended**:

1. **Repeat TSH and free T4**: Confirm persistence and exclude assay error [^116vHLh6]
2. **Total T3 or free T3**: Detect T3-toxicosis if hyperthyroidism suspected [^112AZiH6]
3. **Thyroid antibodies (TRAb, TPOAb)**: Identify autoimmune thyroid disease [^111ZHMVQ]
4. **Thyroid ultrasound**: Evaluate nodules or goiter if suspected [^notfound]
5. **Medication review**: Identify drug-induced TSH suppression [^1142XYF3]

---

## Management guidelines

Management depends on **persistence, symptoms, age, and comorbidities**:

- **Observation**: For asymptomatic, low-risk patients with TSH 0.1–0.4 mIU/L; repeat in 3–6 months [^114Zketr].
- **Treatment**: Consider if TSH is persistently < 0.1 mIU/L, or if there are symptoms, cardiac disease, or osteoporosis [^112mMkjF].
- **Etiology-specific therapy**: Antithyroid drugs or radioiodine for Graves' disease; surgery for large goiters or suspicious nodules [^112MTEEc].

---

## Prognosis and long-term outcomes

The prognosis is **generally favorable**: many revert to normal, though a minority progress to overt hyperthyroidism [^115tmv2A]. Persistent suppression increases risks of atrial fibrillation, osteoporosis, and fractures, especially in older adults [^111yYVBa] [^113dZPzQ].

---

## Special considerations

- **Pregnancy**: TSH often falls in the first trimester; interpret with trimester-specific ranges [^114rAP4D].
- **Elderly**: Age-specific TSH ranges should be used to avoid overdiagnosis [^113bqae9].
- **Medications**: Review and adjust drugs that suppress TSH when possible [^notfound].

---

A TSH of 0.38 mIU/L is **borderline low** and most often reflects subclinical hyperthyroidism. Confirm with repeat testing and free T4, assess risks, and tailor management to symptoms, comorbidities, and persistence.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism (SH) with TSH persistently below the lower limit of normal but ≥ 0.1 mU/L — treatment should be considered in individuals ≥ 65 years of age and in patients with cardiac disease, osteoporosis, or symptoms of hyperthyroidism (weak recommendation, moderate-quality evidence); persistence in this range is defined as a TSH level between 0.1 and 0.4 mU/L on repeated measurement over a 3- to 6-month period.

The clinical utility of TSH measurement — serum TSH is widely used for diagnosis and screening, with age-specific interpretation needs; in newborns < 3 days of age results are confounded by the postnatal surge, while in newborns 3 days to 1 month a serum TSH > 20 mIU/L is generally treated as a clinical cutoff requiring immediate action; primary congenital hypothyroidism is an endocrine emergency; in the elderly the upper bound of the TSH reference interval increases with age; interpretation leverages the log-linear relationship between TSH and free thyroxine (fT4) and must consider factors such as iodine intake, age, sex, biological variation, reproductive status, ethnicity, and the assay method used.

### 2016 American Thyroid Association guidelines for diagnosis and management of hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis [^116o1x3e]. Thyroid (2016). Medium credibility.

Recommendation 11 — patient follow-up after RAI therapy for GD: Follow-up within the first 1–2 months after RAI therapy for GD should include an assessment of free T4, total T3, and TSH, and biochemical monitoring should be continued at 4- to 6-week intervals for 6 months, or until the patient becomes hypothyroid and is stable on thyroid hormone replacement; strong recommendation, low-quality evidence. Most patients respond with normalization of thyroid function and symptom improvement within 4–8 weeks, and hypothyroidism may occur from 4 weeks, with 40% hypothyroid by 8 weeks and > 80% by 16 weeks. Beta-blockers started prior to RAI should be tapered when free T4 and total T3 return to the reference range; as free T4 and total T3 improve, methimazole (MMI) can usually be tapered. Most patients eventually develop hypothyroidism indicated by free T4 below normal; levothyroxine should then be instituted, TSH should not be used initially to determine the need, and replacement dose should be adjusted based on free T4 with careful titration. Once euthyroidism is achieved, lifelong annual thyroid function testing is recommended at least annually, and since TSH may remain suppressed for a month or longer after hyperthyroidism resolves, interpret TSH cautiously and only with free T4 and total T3.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism (SH) with TSH persistently below the lower limit of normal but ≥ 0.1 mU/L — treatment of SH should be considered in individuals ≥ 65 years of age and in patients with cardiac disease or symptoms of hyperthyroidism (2/+00). Persistence in this range is defined as a TSH level between 0.1 and 0.5 mU/L on repeated measurement over a 3–6-month period; the thyroid disorder underlying SH should be diagnosed to avoid treating transient, functional disorders related to acute illness, drugs, and other causes of low TSH. In symptomatic patients, a trial of beta-adrenergic blockers may be useful to determine whether symptomatic therapy might suffice.

### Guidelines for the treatment of hypothyroidism: prepared by the American Thyroid Association task force on thyroid hormone replacement [^1138vdXP]. Thyroid (2014). Medium credibility.

TSH as systemic indicator and its limitations — During initiation of LT4 therapy in myxedematous patients, serum TSH correlated well with both the administered dose (r = −0.9) and the serum FT4 concentration achieved (r = −1.0), and serum TSH has been accepted as a robust, sensitive, and reproducible indicator of thyroid status. The logarithmic relationship between TSH and thyroid hormone means that even with circulating T3 and T4 in the normal range euthyroidism cannot be assumed, and individual ranges for T3 and T4 are broader than individual variance, making measurement of T3 and T4 a suboptimal way to assess thyroid status; however, a caveat is that TSH remains normal in some LT4-treated hypothyroid patients with a high T4:T3 ratio even when T3 levels are lower than normal range.

Thyroid dysfunction definitions — Subclinical hypothyroidism is defined as an asymptomatic condition in which a patient has a serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level exceeding the upper threshold of a specified laboratory reference interval (commonly defined as 4.5 mIU/L) but a normal thyroxine (T4) level, and patients with subclinical hypothyroidism are often further classified as having TSH levels between 4.5 and 10.0 mIU/L or greater than 10.0 mIU/L; "overt" hypothyroidism has been defined biochemically by an elevated TSH level and a low T4 level.

### Thyroid and aging [^113bqae9]. Endocrine Practice (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

Review physiologic thyroid function changes with aging and emphasize careful interpretation of tests in the aging population.

Methods

Literature review.

Results

Using age-specific thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) reference ranges should minimize or avoid the unnecessary diagnosis of thyroid disease in elderly patients. Subclinical thyroid dysfunction and abnormal TSH with normal thyroid levels may improve with time, so careful monitoring of thyroid function is recommended. Overt thyroid disease should always be treated.

Conclusion

Clinical judgement is always warranted to decide how and when to treat subclinical thyroid disease in the elderly.

Abbreviations

FT4 = free thyroxine; rT3 = reverse triiodothyronine; T3 = triiodothyronine; T4 = thyroxine; TFT = thyroid function test; TSH = thyroid-stimulating hormone.

### 2016 American Thyroid Association guidelines for diagnosis and management of hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis [^114Zketr]. Thyroid (2016). Medium credibility.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism with TSH persistently below the lower limit of normal but ≥ 0.1 mU/L — observation is acceptable for asymptomatic patients under age 65 without cardiac disease or osteoporosis, who can be observed without further investigation of the etiology of the subnormal TSH or treatment (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence). In this range, treatment should be considered for older subjects, but it is not recommended for subjects < 65 years of age; younger subjects should be monitored at regular 6- to 12-month intervals, and treatment should be considered if the TSH persistently decreases to < 0.1 mU/L. In patients with symptoms of hyperthyroidism, a trial of β-adrenergic blocking agents may be useful to determine whether symptomatic therapy might suffice.

Laboratory evaluation of thyroid nodules — The high sensitivity of the thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) assay makes it the most useful laboratory test in the initial evaluation of thyroid nodules, and third-generation TSH chemiluminometric assays, with detection limits of about 0.01 μU/mL, should be used; if the serum TSH level is within the reference range (unless suspicion of central hypothyroidism), the measurement of free thyroid hormones adds no further relevant information. To limit unnecessary laboratory testing, the following strategy should be followed for most patients: serum TSH within normal limits — no further testing (unless suspicion of central hypothyroidism); increased serum TSH — test FT4 and TPOAb to evaluate for hypothyroidism; decreased serum TSH — test FT4 and total or FT3 to evaluate for hyperthyroidism.

### Screening for thyroid dysfunction: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^111ra852]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Screening for thyroid dysfunction — interventions and treatment thresholds: The principal treatment for hypothyroidism is oral monotherapy (levothyroxine sodium). Hyperthyroidism is treated with antithyroid medications (such as methimazole) or nonreversible thyroid ablation therapy (for example, radioactive iodine or surgery). Although definitive data are lacking, treatment is generally recommended for patients with a TSH level that is undetectable or less than 0.1 mIU/L, particularly those with overt Graves disease or nodular thyroid disease, whereas treatment is typically not recommended for patients with TSH levels between 0.1 and 0.45 mIU/L or when thyroiditis is the cause.

### Screening and management of thyroid disease… [^111TPnZE]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

In 1998, the American College of Physicians published guidelines on screening for thyroid disease in patients seen by primary care physicians for reasons unrelated to thyroid disease. Screening can be useful to identify overt or subclinical hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. A sensitive thyroid-stimulating hormone test is recommended as a screening test in women more than 50 years of age. If the TSH level is less than 0. 3 to
0. 4 μU per mL or greater than 10 μU per mL, determination of the free thyroxine level is recommended. Screening is not recommended in women less than age 50 or in men because the prevalence of unsuspected symptomatic thyroid dysfunction is low in these populations. Persons found to have subclinical hyperthyroidism are at increased risk for atrial fibrillation, osteoporosis and progression to overt disease.

The optimal management of patients without goiter or ocular findings of Graves' disease is uncertain, but the author recommends repeat measurements of TSH, T 4 and T 3 every six to 12 months. Persons with subclinical hypothyroidism are at increased risk for hypercholesterolemia and progression to overt hypothyroidism. The effectiveness of treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism is uncertain; three small unrandomized trials yielded conflicting results. Observation is appropriate for persons with TSH levels between 5 and 10 μU per mL. A TSH of greater than 10 μU per mL or a high antithyroid antibody titer is associated with an increased risk of complications, and levothyroxine therapy may be appropriate. TSH-suppressive therapy for benign solitary thyroid nodules is controversial. The effectiveness of such therapy in reducing nodule size is uncertain.

Pooled data from seven trials show that nodule volume decreased by more than 50 percent in 25 percent of 242 patients who received levothyroxine and in 8 percent of the control group.

### Clinical parameters are more likely to be associated with thyroid hormone levels than with thyrotropin levels: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111C2vCG]. Thyroid (2020). Medium credibility.

We, therefore, aimed at determining whether or not a systematic review of the literature might indicate the relative merits of thyroid hormone levels and TSH levels, in terms of associations with a broad range of clinical parameters. Because of the strong negative population correlation between free thyroxine (fT4) and TSH, we expected to find associations between both TSH and fT4 levels and the clinical features of thyroid dysfunction. We further reasoned that if the clinical features were associated better with TSH levels, the current rationale for thyroid function testing and the current consequent clinical and research classifications and practices would be supported, but, if the clinical features were associated better with thyroid hormone levels, these classifications and practices would warrant review. In this latter circumstance, the previously noted associations of clinical features with TSH levels could be attributed to the aforementioned strong negative population correlation between fT4 and TSH.

### TSH and FT4 reference interval recommendations and prevalence of gestational thyroid dysfunction: quantification of current diagnostic approaches [^114UrAad]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Context

Guidelines recommend use of population- and trimester-specific thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and free thyroxine (FT4) reference intervals (RIs) in pregnancy. Since these are often unavailable, clinicians frequently rely on alternative diagnostic strategies. We sought to quantify the diagnostic consequences of current recommendations.

Methods

We included cohorts participating in the Consortium on Thyroid and Pregnancy. Different approaches were used to define RIs: a TSH fixed upper limit of 4.0 mU/L (fixed limit approach), a fixed subtraction from the upper limit for TSH of 0.5 mU/L (subtraction approach) and using nonpregnancy RIs. Outcome measures were sensitivity and false discovery rate (FDR) of women for whom levothyroxine treatment was indicated and those for whom treatment would be considered according to international guidelines.

Results

The study population comprised 52 496 participants from 18 cohorts. Compared with the use of trimester-specific RIs, alternative approaches had a low sensitivity (0.63–0.82) and high FDR (0.11–0.35) to detect women with a treatment indication or consideration. Sensitivity and FDR to detect a treatment indication in the first trimester were similar between the fixed limit, subtraction, and nonpregnancy approach (0.77–0.11 vs 0.74–0.16 vs 0.60–0.11). The diagnostic performance to detect overt hypothyroidism, isolated hypothyroxinemia, and (sub)clinical hyperthyroidism mainly varied between FT4 RI approaches, while the diagnostic performance to detect subclinical hypothyroidism varied between the applied TSH RI approaches.

Conclusion

Alternative approaches to define RIs for TSH and FT4 in pregnancy result in considerable overdiagnosis and underdiagnosis compared with population- and trimester-specific RIs. Additional strategies need to be explored to optimize identification of thyroid dysfunction during pregnancy.

### Thyroid stimulating hormone and thyroid hormones (triiodothyronine and thyroxine): an American Thyroid Association-commissioned review of current clinical and laboratory status [^114TbpGd]. Thyroid (2023). High credibility.

TSH reference variability and pregnancy — Median TSH values tend to be higher in iodine-deficient populations than those found in iodine sufficient groups, so population iodine intake should be considered when interpreting TSH values. During pregnancy, the reference interval for TSH varies by trimester, fetal number, geography, and assay; TSH is lowest in the first trimester, lower in women with twins than in women with singleton pregnancies, is ∼0.4 mIU/L lower in African and Asian women, and is higher in women with insufficient iodine intake. Target TSH values for patients taking T4 are dependent on the clinical indication for hormone replacement; for instance, TSH suppression is often recommended for thyroid cancer patients post-thyroidectomy.

PREFACE

This document aims to provide a state-of-the-art status report on the progress achieved in thyroid testing, including thyrotropin (TSH), thyroxine (T4), and triiodothyronine (T3). The target audience for this document includes general practitioners, endocrinologists, and laboratory professionals. It is not a systematic review or a guidance document addressing currently encountered diagnostic and clinical challenges related to these three key parameters of thyroid testing (Box 1). It does not cover the use of thyroid antibodies for investigating the etiology of thyroid dysfunction, or the use of thyroglobulin as a tumor marker for differentiated thyroid cancer or the investigation of primary congenital or acquired hypothyroidism.

Box 1.
Key Clinical Points for Interpreting Thyroid Tests

Clinically relevant aspects of thyroid pathophysiology and the regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid-peripheral axis have recently been reviewed elsewhere. Generic abbreviations for thyroid hormones (THs), T4 and T3, are used in this text, if both total and free TH are meant. Total T4 (TT4) and total T3 (TT3) are used for total and free T4 (fT4) or free T3 (fT3) for free TH concentrations, respectively.

### The evidence for a narrower thyrotropin reference range is compelling [^112t6NpZ]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2005). Low credibility.

Debate and controversy currently surround the recommendations of a recent consensus conference that considered issues related to the management of early, mild, or so-called subclinical hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism. Intimately related to the controversy is the definition of the normal reference range for TSH. It has become clear that previously accepted reference ranges are no longer valid as a result of both the development of more highly sensitive TSH assays and the appreciation that reference populations previously considered normal were contaminated with individuals with various degrees of thyroid dysfunction that served to increase mean TSH levels for the group. Recent laboratory guidelines from the National Academy of Clinical Biochemistry indicate that more than 95% of normal individuals have TSH levels below 2.5 mU/liter. The remainder with higher values are outliers, most of whom are likely to have underlying Hashimoto thyroiditis or other causes of elevated TSH. Importantly, data indicating that African-Americans with very low incidence of Hashimoto thyroiditis have a mean TSH level of 1.18 mU/liter strongly suggest that this value is the true normal mean for a normal population. Recognition and establishment of a more precise and true normal range for TSH have important implications for both screening and treatment of thyroid disease in general and subclinical thyroid disease in particular.

### The TSH upper reference limit: where are we at? [^113kszhz]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2011). Medium credibility.

The diagnosis of subclinical hypothyroidism — serum TSH levels above and T(4) levels within the laboratory reference ranges — depends critically on the upper limit of the TSH reference interval. Calls have been made to lower the current upper TSH reference limit of 4.0 mU/l to 2.5 mU/l to exclude patients with occult hypothyroidism. However, data from population studies do not indicate that the distribution of TSH is altered owing to inclusion of such individuals. The opposite suggestion has also been put forward; the TSH upper reference limit is often too low, especially in the elderly, in women and in white individuals, which may lead to unnecessary or even harmful therapy. Studies in elderly individuals have shown that although aging may be associated with increased TSH levels, paradoxically, overt hypothyroidism in this population may be associated with a less robust TSH response than in young individuals. This Review highlights the interindividual and intraindividual variability of TSH levels and discusses the current controversy that surrounds the appropriateness of reference ranges defined on the basis of age, race, sex and amount of iodine intake. Moreover, the current evidence on lowering or increasing the upper limit of the TSH reference interval is reviewed and the need to individualize levothyroxine treatment in patients with elevated TSH levels is discussed.

### Clinical practice guidelines for hypothyroidism in adults: cosponsored by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and the American Thyroid Association [^1142XYF3]. Endocrine Practice (2012). Medium credibility.

Hypothyroidism in adults — serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) interpretation pitfalls include acute illness; pregnancy; central hypothyroidism from nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas; effects of subcutaneous octreotide and oral bexarotene; anorexia nervosa; heterophile or interfering antibodies; and adrenal insufficiency. In acute illness, TSH may be suppressed with levels below 0.1 mIU/L and testing in hospitalized patients "should be only performed if there is a strong clinical suspicion for thyroid dysfunction". During pregnancy, TSH typically falls in the first trimester, but infrequently to below 0.1 mIU/L, and returns to normal in the second trimester. In central hypothyroidism due to nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas, mildly elevated TSH is described, generally not above 6 or 7 mIU/L, due to bioinactive isoforms. Drug and condition effects are specified: subcutaneous octreotide does not cause persistent central hypothyroidism, oral bexarotene almost always does, anorexia nervosa may show low TSH with low free T4, heterophile or interfering antibodies may cause falsely elevated TSH values, and adrenal insufficiency may be associated with TSH elevations reversed with glucocorticoid replacement.

### 2016 American Thyroid Association guidelines for diagnosis and management of hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis [^114fiaqB]. Thyroid (2016). Medium credibility.

Hyperthyroidism — biochemical evaluation and assay pitfalls state that serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) measurement has the highest sensitivity and specificity of any single blood test used in the evaluation of suspected thyrotoxicosis and should be used as an initial screening test; when thyrotoxicosis is strongly suspected, diagnostic accuracy improves when a serum TSH, free T4, and total T3 are assessed at the initial evaluation. In overt hyperthyroidism, serum free T4, T3, or both are elevated, and serum TSH is subnormal (usually < 0.01 mU/L in a third-generation assay); in mild hyperthyroidism, serum T4 and free T4 can be normal with only serum T3 elevated and serum TSH low or undetectable; subclinical hyperthyroidism is defined as a normal serum free T4 and normal total T3 or free T3, with subnormal serum TSH concentration, and a normal serum TSH level precludes the diagnosis of thyrotoxicosis in the absence of a TSH-producing pituitary adenoma or thyroid hormone resistance or spurious interfering antibodies. Assays for estimating free T3 are less widely validated and less robust than those for free T4; therefore, measurement of total T3 is frequently preferred over free T3 in clinical practice. The term euthyroid hyperthyroxinemia refers to elevated T4 (and frequently elevated total serum T3) without hyperthyroidism from protein-binding abnormalities such as elevations in T4 binding globulin or transthyretin, familial dysalbuminemic hyperthyroxinemia, and rarely immunoglobulins that directly bind T4 or T3; spurious results may arise from heterophilic antibodies causing high TSH, which should be ruled out by repeat testing, serial dilution, or anti-mouse antibody measurement, and ingestion of high doses of biotin may cause spuriously low results in assays that utilize a streptavidin–biotin separation technique.

Background

Basal TSH levels reflect the metabolic status of thyroid function, however the definition and interpretation of the basal levels of TSH is a matter of controversial debate. The aim of this study was to evaluate basal TSH levels in relation to the physiological response to i.v. TRH stimulation.

Methods

A series of 2570 women attending a specialized endocrine unit were evaluated. A standardized i.v. TRH stimulation test was carried out by applying 200 μg of TRH. TSH levels were measured both in the basal and the 30 minute blood sample. The normal response to TRH stimulation had been previously determined to be an absolute value lying between 2.5 and 20 mIU/l. Both TSH values were analyzed by cross tabulation. In addition the results were compared to reference values taken from the literature.

Results

Basal TSH values were within the normal range (0.3 to 3.5 mIU/l) in 91,5% of cases, diminished in 3,8% and elevated in 4.7%. Based on the response to TRH, 82.4% were considered euthyroid, 3.3% were latent hyperthyroid, and 14.3% were latent hypothyroid. Combining the data on basal and stimulated TSH levels, latent hypothyroidism was found in the following proportions for different TSH levels: 5.4% for TSH < 2.0 mIU/l, 30.2% for TSH between 2.0 and 3.0 mIU/l, 65,5% for TSH between 3.0 and 3.50 mIU/l, 87.5% for TSH between 3.5 and 4.0 mIU/l, and 88.2% for TSH between 4 and 5 mIU/l. The use of an upper normal range for TSH of 2.5 mIU/l, as recommended in the literature, misclassified 7.7% of euthyroid cases.

Conclusion

Our analysis strategy allows us to delineate the predictive value of basal TSH levels in relation to latent hypothyroidism. A grey area can be identified for values between 3.0 and 3.5 mIU/l.

### Thyroid stimulating hormone and thyroid hormones (triiodothyronine and thyroxine): an American Thyroid Association-commissioned review of current clinical and laboratory status [^115MVPFW]. Thyroid (2023). Medium credibility.

Background: Despite being the most performed laboratory endocrine investigation, the optimum use of thyroid tests (thyrotropin [TSH] and thyroid hormone [TH] measurement) is open to question and the interpretation of the results from these tests can be ambiguous. The American Thyroid Association (ATA) with its expertise support the endeavor of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine (IFCC) to improve and maintain standardization and harmonization of thyroid testing. ATA mandated an international interdisciplinary working group panel to survey the status of thyroid testing by reviewing the recent literature to revise or update the criteria as needed in mutual agreement and to inform clinical care. Summary: This review represents the conclusions on the clinical use of current routine TSH and TH (thyroxine [T4] and triiodothyronine [T3]) assays, taking into account geographic differences in disease prevalence and clinical and laboratory practice among writing members. The interaction between physiological, pathophysiological, and pharmacological factors and thyroid assays can affect their measurements and confound result interpretation. These factors need to be considered in the clinical context of the patient for appropriate test ordering and result interpretation. Despite significant advances in laboratory methods over the past 50 years, routine thyroid assays remain susceptible to idiosyncratic analytical interference that may produce spurious results. Improved standardization needs to be demonstrated through ongoing international efforts before results from different assays can be considered equivalent. Emerging technology (e.g., mass spectrometry) shows promise for improved analytical performance, but more evidence of its clinical utility and improved throughput is required before it can be considered for routine use. Close clinical-laboratory collaboration is encouraged to overcome and avoid the pitfalls in thyroid testing as well as resolve clinically discrepant results. The evidence base supporting the conclusions of this review is summarized in four detailed online technical supplements. Conclusions: Over the past five decades, testing for TSH, T4, and T3 has evolved from manual radioisotopic immunoassays to nonisotopic multiplexed immunometric assays using highly automated equipment. Despite these technical advances, physicians and laboratorians performing these analyses must understand limitations of these methods to properly order tests and interpret results.

Potential harms and treatment thresholds in thyroid dysfunction emphasize that the harms of treatment have not been well-studied, with the most important potential harms being false-positive results, labeling, and overdiagnosis and overtreatment; false positives occur because TSH secretion is highly variable and sensitive to several common factors and determining true- versus false-positive results is complicated by a lack of consensus on a normal reference interval; no clinical trial data support a treatment threshold to improve outcomes, and on the basis of expert opinion, a TSH level greater than 10.0 mIU/L is generally considered the threshold for initiation of treatment.

### Thyrotropin releasing hormone [^111yAUwj]. FDA (2012). Low credibility.

INTERPRETATION OF TEST RESULTS

Interpretation of the TSH response to TRH requires an understanding of thyroid-pituitary-hypothalamic physiology and knowledge of the clinical status of the individual patient. Because the TSH test results may vary with the laboratory, the physician should be familiar with the TSH assay method used and the normal range for the laboratory performing the assay. TSH response 30 minutes after TRH administration in normal subjects and in patients with hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism are presented in Figure 2. The diagnoses were established prior to the administration of TRH on the basis of the clinical history, physical examination, and the results of other thyroid and/or pituitary function tests.

Among the normal euthyroid subjects, women and children were found to have higher levels of TSH at 30 minutes than men.

Among the patients with hyperthyroidism or primary (thyroidal), secondary (pituitary), or tertiary (hypothalamic) hypothyroidism, no significant differences in TSH levels by age or sex were found.

Figure 2

Normal: Baseline TSH levels of less than 10 microunits/mL (μU/mL) were observed in 97% of euthyroid normal subjects tested. Thirty minutes after TRH, the serum TSH increased by 2.0 mμU/mL or more in 95% of euthyroid subjects.

Hyperthyroidism: All hyperthyroid patients tested had baseline TSH levels of less than 10 μU/mL and a rise of less than 2 μU/pL 30 minutes after TRH.

### Screening for thyroid dysfunction: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^112MTEEc]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) screening for thyroid dysfunction — population is nonpregnant, asymptomatic adults; recommendation is "No recommendation. Grade: I statement (insufficient evidence)". Risk factors for an elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level include female sex, advancing age, white race, type 1 diabetes, Down syndrome, family history of thyroid disease, goiter, previous hyperthyroidism, and external-beam radiation in the head and neck area; risk factors for a low TSH level include female sex; advancing age; black race; low iodine intake; personal or family history of thyroid disease; and ingestion of iodine-containing drugs, such as amiodarone. The primary screening test is serum TSH testing, and multiple tests over 3 to 6 months should be performed to confirm or rule out abnormal findings; follow-up testing of serum thyroxine (T4) levels in persons with persistently abnormal TSH levels can differentiate between subclinical (normal T4 level) and overt (abnormal T4 level) thyroid dysfunction. Hypothyroidism is treated with oral T4 monotherapy (levothyroxine sodium); consensus is lacking on the appropriate point for clinical intervention, especially for TSH levels < 10.0 mIU/L. Hyperthyroidism is treated with antithyroid medications (e.g., methimazole) or nonreversible thyroid ablation therapy (e.g., radioactive iodine or surgery), and treatment is generally recommended for patients with a TSH level that is undetectable or < 0.1 mIU/L, particularly those with overt Graves disease or nodular thyroid disease. The current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for thyroid dysfunction in nonpregnant, asymptomatic adults.

### Interpretation of thyroid function tests [^114Ub1fK]. Lancet (2001). Excellent credibility.

The introduction of sensitive thyrotropin assays and free thyroid hormone measurements has simplified the interpretation of thyroid function tests. However, important pitfalls and difficult cases still exist. In this review, thyroid function test results are grouped into six different patterns. We propose that if assays for thyrotropin, free T3, and free T4 are all done, knowledge of these patterns coupled with clinical details and simple additional tests allow a diagnosis to be made in almost all cases.

Screening for thyroid dysfunction — tests and interval: The serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) test is the primary screening test for thyroid dysfunction, and multiple tests should be done over a 3- to 6-month interval to confirm or rule out abnormal findings; follow-up testing of serum thyroxine (T4) levels in persons with persistently abnormal TSH levels can differentiate between subclinical (normal T4 levels) and "overt" (abnormal T4 levels) thyroid dysfunction. The optimal screening interval for thyroid dysfunction (if one exists) is unknown.

### Approach to the patient with subclinical hyperthyroidism [^116z1K3j]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2007). Low credibility.

Endogenous subclinical hyperthyroidism, defined by normal circulating levels of free T4 and T3 and low levels of TSH, is a common clinical entity and is typically caused by the same conditions that account for the majority of cases of overt hyperthyroidism: Graves' disease, toxic multinodular goiter, and solitary autonomously functioning thyroid nodules. Subclinical hyperthyroidism has been associated with an increased risk of atrial fibrillation and mortality, decreased bone mineral density in postmenopausal women, and mild hyperthyroid symptoms. Treatment of subclinical hyperthyroidism remains controversial, given the lack of prospective randomized controlled trials showing clinical benefit with restoration of the euthyroid state. Nevertheless, it seems reasonable to treat older individuals whose serum TSH levels are less than 0.1 mU/liter and certain high-risk patients, even when the serum TSH is between 0.1 and the lower limit of the normal range.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism (SH) — prevalence and natural history show that in a representative U.S. sample without known thyroid disease, 0.7% had suppressed TSH (< 0.1 mU/L) and 1.8% had low TSH (< 0.4 mU/L). The natural history is variable, with annualized rates of 0.5%–7% progression to overt hyperthyroidism and 5%–12% reversion to normal TSH levels. Progression to overt hyperthyroidism appears more likely when TSH is suppressed (< 0.01 mIU/L) rather than low but detectable (0.01–0.4 mIU/L).

Thyroid nodule evaluation — serum thyrotropin (TSH) and radionuclide scan — With the discovery of a thyroid nodule > 1 cm in any diameter, a serum TSH level should be obtained, and if the serum TSH is subnormal, a radionuclide thyroid scan should be obtained to document whether the nodule is hyperfunctioning, isofunctioning, or nonfunctioning. Since hyperfunctioning nodules rarely harbor malignancy, if one corresponds to the nodule, no cytologic evaluation is necessary, although if overt or subclinical hyperthyroidism is present, additional evaluation is required. A higher serum TSH level, even within the upper part of the reference range, is associated with increased risk of malignancy in a thyroid nodule, as well as more advanced stage thyroid cancer.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: thyroid carcinoma, version 1.2025 [^114oaquZ]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

Thyroid hormone suppression of TSH — Postoperative levothyroxine to decrease thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels is considered optimal for higher-risk papillary, follicular, or oncocytic carcinoma, and the NCCN Panel recommends tailoring suppression to individual risk. For known residual carcinoma or high risk of recurrence, the recommended TSH level is < 0.1 mIU/L; for disease-free, low-risk patients, TSH should be maintained at the normal range; and for low-risk patients with imaging negative but concerning Tg, TSH should be maintained at 0.1–0.5 mIU/L. Potential toxicities include cardiac tachyarrhythmias, bone demineralization, and frank symptoms of thyrotoxicosis; therefore, an adequate daily intake of elemental calcium (1200 mg/day) and vitamin D (1000 units/day) is recommended when TSH is chronically suppressed, and reports do not suggest altered bone mineral density in patients receiving levothyroxine.

Clinical thyrotropin (TSH) measurement — Serum TSH measurement is the best test to screen for primary hypothyroidism in all age groups, but TSH measurement alone is not sufficient for the diagnosis or treatment of patients with central hypothyroidism. In acute and/or intercurrent illness, interpretation is not straightforward and should take into account other patient factors, and age, sex, reproductive status, medications, ethnicity, iodine intake, and biological variation, but not circadian or circannual rhythms, are important variables to consider when interpreting TSH values.

### Evaluation of thyroid hormone status: are simultaneous TSH and FT4 tests necessary? Analysis of thyroid function test results taken from the greater manchester care record 2010–2023 [^111gYAAK]. Clinical Endocrinology (2025). Medium credibility.

We acknowledge previous work suggesting that combined fT4 and TSH testing is not necessary, with the alternative being a two‐step approach based on first testing TSH. However, in this representative large community sample, we have identified a large number of people treated with levothyroxine who have a fT4 outside the laboratory RR.

There is variability in relation to the way that thyroid hormone status assessment is decided. However, the laboratory can lead on best practice. We here have provided evidence that thyroid function testing for individuals on levothyroxine replacement should include a check of fT4 as well as TSH. Such an approach, if adopted, can be enabled by the simple strategy of requiring the clinician requesting the test to state whether or not the patient is taking thyroid hormone replacement with a mandatory tick box.

Regarding cost estimates, while assay costs will be subject to some variation between laboratories, our estimate is for an additional £0.80 (Euro 0.93) of fT4 estimation to be added to TSH (£1.00) (Euro 1.16) for the cost of TSH alone, giving a total cost of £1.80 (Euro 2.09) for fT4 and TSH to be assayed together.

We accept that we do not have sufficient data to support a universal recommendation. Given the possible risks associated with prolonged exposure to high and low fT4 levels, we suggest that where indicated, fT4 and TSH should both be measured, in particular for those treated with levothyroxine, to enable thyroid hormone replacement dose adjustment as appropriate. In any case, if pituitary/hypothalamic disease is suspected fT4 and TSH should be checked in order not to miss pituitary insufficiency.

### Screening for thyroid dysfunction: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^114bqgrE]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) screening performance and variability — test characteristics and limitations are outlined: specificity is "about 92%", most laboratories "define an abnormal TSH test result by using the upper and lower limits of the 95% reference interval for a particular assay (generally about 0.4 to 4.5 mIU/L)", and among older adults "12% of persons aged 80 years or older with no evidence of thyroid disease have been found to have TSH levels greater than 4.5 mIU/L". Day-to-day mean values can vary "by as much as 50%", with "up to 40% variation" in same-time serial measurements; consequently, "All of this confirms the importance of not relying on a single TSH value to establish a diagnosis of thyroid dysfunction" and "Serial TSH measurements are an essential step in establishing that a thyroid disorder is real and persistent", while "TSH secretion is highly sensitive to factors other than thyroid disorders".

### Thyroid stimulating hormone and thyroid hormones (triiodothyronine and thyroxine): an American Thyroid Association-commissioned review of current clinical and laboratory status [^11393xk4]. Thyroid (2023). High credibility.

Key clinical points for interpreting thyroid tests — most thyroid tests are performed on multimodality automated immunoassay instrument systems, and the same test from different manufacturer instruments can differ in absolute value; use appropriate reference intervals for interpretation, recognizing that laboratories may change instruments and reference intervals without consulting or alerting physicians. Interference is rare but can affect any thyroid test result and includes heterophile antibodies (HABs), analyte autoantibodies, high-dose biotin, pharmaceuticals, and nutritional factors; HAb interference can affect multiple tests and, when detected, it should be noted in the patients' chart, and interference should be suspected when the test result is discordant with the clinical presentation of the patient, while the laboratory may not have access to the clinical condition of the patient. The reference interval typically represents the 95% confidence limits for a control population without thyroid disease and the between-person reference interval is typically wider than the within-person reference interval. Thyrotropin (TSH) represents a more sensitive reflection of thyroid status than free thyroxine (fT4) because of the log-linear TSH–fT4 relationship; however, TSH is only a valid measure of thyroid status if the hypothalamic-pituitary axis is intact and it may take weeks to months for the TSH measurement to accurately reflect thyroid status after an acute change.

### Hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis: management guidelines of the American Thyroid Association and American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists [^112AZiH6]. Endocrine Practice (2011). Medium credibility.

Hyperthyroidism — biochemical evaluation states that serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) measurement has the highest sensitivity and specificity of any single blood test in suspected hyperthyroidism and should be used as an initial screening test; when hyperthyroidism is strongly suspected, diagnostic accuracy improves when both a serum TSH and free T4 are assessed at the initial evaluation. The relationship between free T4 and TSH is an inverse log-linear relationship, so small changes in free T4 result in large changes in serum TSH, and serum TSH levels are considerably more sensitive than direct thyroid hormone measurements for assessing excess. In overt hyperthyroidism, both serum free T4 and T3 estimates are usually elevated and serum TSH is undetectable, whereas in milder hyperthyroidism serum T4 and free T4 can be normal, only serum T3 may be elevated, and serum TSH will be < 0.01 mU/L (or undetectable), a pattern called "T3-toxicosis"; assays for estimating free T3 are less widely validated than those for free T4, so measurement of total T3 is frequently preferred in clinical practice.

Differentiated thyroid cancer — thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) suppression targets in long-term follow-up (Recommendation 70) are response-specific. In patients with a structural incomplete response to therapy, the serum TSH should be maintained below 0.1 mU/L indefinitely in the absence of specific contraindications (Strong recommendation, Moderate-quality evidence). In patients with a biochemical incomplete response to therapy, the serum TSH should be maintained between 0.1 and 0.5 mU/L, taking into account the initial ATA risk classification, Tg level, Tg trend over time, and risk of TSH suppression (Weak recommendation, Low-quality evidence). In patients who presented with high-risk disease but have an excellent (clinically and biochemically free of disease) or indeterminate response to therapy, consideration should be given to maintaining thyroid hormone therapy to achieve serum TSH levels of 0.1–0.5 mU/L for up to 5 years after which the degree of TSH suppression can be reduced with continued surveillance for recurrence (Weak recommendation, Low-quality evidence). In patients with an excellent (clinically and biochemically free of disease) or indeterminate response to therapy, especially those at low risk for recurrence, the serum TSH may be kept within the low reference range (0.5–2 mU/L) (Strong recommendation, Moderate-quality evidence). In patients who have not undergone remnant ablation or adjuvant therapy who demonstrate an excellent or indeterminate response to therapy with a normal neck US, and low or undetectable suppressed serum Tg, and Tg or anti-Tg antibodies that are not rising, the serum TSH can be allowed to rise to the low reference range (0.5–2 mU/L) (Weak recommendation, Low-quality evidence).

### Subclinical thyroid disease: clinical applications [^111trvZ4]. JAMA (2004). Excellent credibility.

Subclinical hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism are diagnoses based on laboratory evaluation with few if any clinical signs or symptoms. Subclinical hypothyroidism is defined as an elevation in serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) above the upper limit of the reference range (0.45–4.5 mIU/L) with normal serum FT4 concentration; subclinical hyperthyroidism is defined as a decrease in serum TSH below the reference range with normal serum FT4 and T3 concentrations. Though these conditions represent the earliest stages of thyroid dysfunction, the benefits of detecting and treating subclinical thyroid disease are not well established. Most persons found to have subclinical thyroid disease will have TSH values between 0.1 and 0.45 mIU/L or between 4.5 and 10 mIU/L, for which the benefits of treatment are not clearly established; treatment may be beneficial in individuals with serum TSH lower than 0.1 mIU/L or higher than 10 mIU/L. This article illustrates approaches to managing patients with subclinical hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism through 5 case scenarios that apply the principles of evidence-based medicine. Because of the substantial uncertainty concerning the consequences of untreated subclinical hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism, as well as the benefit of initiating treatment, patient preferences are important in deciding on management of subclinical disease.

### Screening for thyroid dysfunction: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^112pWQ61]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Screening for thyroid dysfunction — variability and potential overdiagnosis: Management of patients with thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels between 4.5 and 10.0 mIU/L is described as more controversial, with a likely large magnitude of overdiagnosis and overtreatment from screening; the high variability of TSH secretion and frequent reversion to normal underscore the importance of not relying on a single abnormal laboratory value, and it is not possible to differentiate those who will progress from those who will remain stable or normalize, so treating the latter yields no benefit and can cause harms from antithyroid medications, ablation therapy, and long-term thyroid hormone therapy.

### Rationalizing thyroid function testing: which TSH cutoffs are optimal for testing free T4? [^113KVT47]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2017). Low credibility.

Context

Thyroid function testing often uses thyrotropin (TSH) measurement first, followed by reflex testing for free thyroxine (T4) if TSH is outside the reference range. The utility of different TSH cutoffs for reflex testing is unknown.

Objective

To examine different TSH cutoffs for reflex free T4 testing.

Design, Setting, and Patients

We analyzed concurrent TSH and free T4 results from 120,403 individuals from a single laboratory in Western Australia (clinical cohort) and 4568 Busselton Health Study participants (community cohort).

Results

In the clinical cohort, restricting free T4 measurement to individuals with TSH < 0.3 or > 5.0 mU/L resulted in a 22% reduction in free T4 testing compared with a TSH reference range of 0.4 to 4.0 mU/L; using TSH cutoffs of 0.2 and 6.0 mU/L resulted in a 34% reduction in free T4 testing. In the community cohort, the corresponding effect was less: 3.3% and 4.8% reduction in free T4 testing. In the clinical cohort, using TSH cutoffs of 0.2 and 6.0 mU/L, elevated free T4 would go undetected in 4.2% of individuals with TSH levels of 0.2 to 0.4 mU/L. In most, free T4 was marginally elevated and unlikely to indicate clinically relevant hyperthyroidism. Low free T4 would go undetected in 2.5% of individuals with TSH levels of 4 to 6 mU/L; in 94%, free T4 was marginally reduced and unlikely to indicate clinically relevant hypothyroidism.

Conclusions

Setting TSH cutoffs at 0.1 to 0.2 mU/L less than and 1 to 2 mU/L greater than the reference range for reflex testing of free T4 would reduce the need for free T4 testing, with minimal effect on case finding.

In this individual participant data meta-analysis, we aimed to quantify the performance of commonly used alternative diagnostic approaches to laboratory- and trimester-specific reference intervals. These alternatives include (1) use of a fixed upper limit for TSH, (2) employing a modified upper limit of TSH by subtracting from the nonpregnant upper limit of TSH, and (3) utilizing unadjusted nonpregnancy reference intervals for TSH and FT4 as a historical benchmark. We focused on discerning the impact of these alternatives on clinically consequential decisions such as indications or considerations for treatment as per prevailing international guidelines.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism — osteoporosis and fracture outcomes: Most studies show decreased bone mineral density in postmenopausal women, but not in men or premenopausal women. In the largest individual study, the hazard rate for all major osteoporotic fractures was 1.13 (confidence intervals 1.014–1.26), with risk increasing over time such that after a median follow-up of 7.5 years, 13.5% with low TSH had at least one major osteoporotic fracture versus 6.9% with normal TSH. A participant-level meta-analysis found hazard ratios of 1.36 for hip fractures (4.9 fractures per 1000 person-years) and 1.28 for any fractures (14.4 vs. 11.2 per 1000 person-years), with risks further increased when TSH was < 0.1 mIU/L compared to 0.1–0.44 mIU/L and for endogenous SH.

### Adding interpretative comments to results of thyroid function tests from patients on thyroxine replacement does not improve management [^116Z9jHr]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2025). Medium credibility.

Aims

To assess the impact of adding clinical comments to reports of thyroid function testing in patients treated for hypothyroidism.

Methods

We compared thyroid function test results in primary care patients being treated for hypothyroidism from January 2016 to August 2023 at two NHS Trusts with similar demographics and using the same instruments, but with different interpretative comment policies. One laboratory, Buckinghamshire Health Trust (Bucks), adds interpretative comments, whereas the other, Oxford University Hospitals (Oxford), does not. We used two outcome measures: the percentage of patients with thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) within the reference interval on repeat testing and the timing of repeat TSH testing samples, according to the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidance (NG145).

Results

We identified 18242 and 31655 hypothyroid patients (9.0% and 7.7% of the population tested) in Bucks and Oxford, with a total of 121961 and 247639 tests over the evaluation period, respectively. The proportion of TSH results within the reference interval (83.4% in Bucks, 83.9% in Oxford) was similar in both Trusts, as was TSH concentration (median TSH concentration 1.60 (IQR 0.78–2.82) mU/L in Bucks, 1.68 (IQR 0.97–2.76) in Oxford). The interval between tests was shorter in Oxford, but differed significantly from NG145 in both Trusts. Differences were statistically significant for both outcome measures, but of questionable clinical significance.

Conclusions

Adding interpretative comments to results of thyroid function tests does not appear to affect the distribution of TSH concentrations in primary care patients on thyroxine replacement or the intervals between tests in a clinically meaningful way.

Conclusion

Our data analysis strategy supports a normal reference range for TSH of 0.3 to 3.5 mIU/l. Either a clinical and laboratory control or a TRH test can be recommended for patients with basal TSH values lying between 3.0 and 3.5 mIU/l in order to rule out latent hypothyroidism.

Subclinical thyroid diseases are defined by abnormal serum thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels associated with normal thyroid hormone concentrations. The diagnosis of these conditions depends on defining the 'normal' euthyroid TSH range; in this review, arguments for and against lowering the upper limit of TSH are summarised. Although, subclinical hypothyroidism and subclinical hyperthyroidism are frequently encountered, their long-term consequences are debated due to conflicting results from many observational studies. The causes, effects and outcomes of treatment of both subclinical diseases are described, and the direction of future research in these conditions is outlined.

### TSH and FT4 reference intervals in pregnancy: a systematic review and individual participant data meta-analysis [^117PB58f]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Another important finding of the IPD is the substantial change in reference limits when using the 5th to 95th percentile range rather than the internationally advised 2.5th to 97.5th percentile range. This effect was consistent through all trimesters for the upper limit of TSH (for the first, second, and third trimester: –0.63, –0.65, and –0.73 mU/L, respectively), the lower limit of FT4 (+0.5, +0.5, +0.6 pmol/L, or +0.04, +0.04, +0.05 ng/dL) and in a declining trend for the upper limit of FT4 (–1.6, –1.2, –0.7 pmol/L, or –0.12, –0.09, –0.05 ng/dL). Especially TSH, and to a lesser extent FT4, concentrations in pregnancy follow a right skewed distribution, which explains the relatively larger absolute effect of percentile shifts on the upper reference limit. Narrowing the reference intervals by using reference cut-offs above the 2.5th and below the 97.5th percentile (eg, the 5th to 95th percentile as assessed in this study) will result in more women diagnosed with thyroid disease in clinical settings purely from a mathematical point of view. Moreover, since predominantly the upper rather than the lower reference limits of TSH and FT4 are affected, specifically more women will be diagnosed with subclinical hypothyroidism and overt hyperthyroidism. To our knowledge, no studies have systematically assessed whether women with TSH or FT4 concentrations between the 95th and 97.5th percentile are also at increased risk of adverse pregnancy events and whether they might benefit from treatment. Implementing reference intervals based on the 5th to 95th percentiles may therefore lead to considerable overdiagnosis and overtreatment in the clinical setting.

T4 measurement — free versus total: T4 is the main hormone exclusively produced and secreted by the thyroid gland (T4 to T3 ratio in thyroglobulin is ∼10:1), while the majority of T3 (∼80%) is generated in extrathyroidal tissues. Circulating TH concentrations are affected by serum TH binding proteins, and serum fT4 should be measured in preference to T4 despite its very low fraction of T4 (0.03%).

### Hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis: management guidelines of the American Thyroid Association and American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists [^114rAP4D]. Endocrine Practice (2011). Medium credibility.

American Thyroid Association/AACE — Thyroid function testing during pregnancy — diagnostic interpretation is as follows: Serum TSH levels may be below the nonpregnant reference range in the first half of a normal-term pregnancy; therefore, low serum TSH with normal free T4 in early pregnancy does not indicate abnormal thyroid function, and during the second half of pregnancy the lower limit for TSH in the nonpregnant population can be used. Serum total T4 and T3 increase in early pregnancy and, from the late first trimester, reference ranges are close to 1.5 times nonpregnancy ranges during the second and third trimesters. Total T4 and T3 may be combined with a T3 uptake test or TBG measurements to create "free T4 index" or "TBG adjusted T4", which may be useful for diagnosing hyperthyroidism in pregnancy, but trimester-specific normal reference ranges should be established for each individual test and assay used. The reliability of automated analog-based free T4 and free T3 assays has been questioned, and method-specific reference ranges for each trimester of pregnancy should be employed by the manufacturer.

THE CLINICAL UTILITY OF TH MEASUREMENTS COMPLEMENTING INTERPRETATION OF THE PRIMARY PARAMETER TSH

Serum TSH concentration is the single best biomarker to confirm a diagnosis and also the magnitude of primary thyroid disease as a consequence of the log-linear TSH–fT4 relationship. Although not necessary for the diagnosis of primary disease, T4 (and for specific constellations also T3) measurements are often added when TSH values fall outside the reference interval as this allows classification of thyroid disease into overt or subclinical, and can direct therapeutic options accordingly (see "TSH and Thyroid Hormone Measurement: Clinical Algorithm" in Technical Supplementary Fig. S1).

TH measurement is also required to complement TSH measurement in a number of clinical situations (Table 2) such as pregnancy, intercurrent illness when TSH can be suppressed (the nonthyroidal illness syndrome,), and the initial treatment of hypo-or hyperthyroidismas the response of the pituitary-thyroid axis can be delayed after a change in thyroid status.

Table 2.
Common Physiological and Pharmacological Effects on the Biology of the Thyroid Hormone Axis

While the term "thyroid function test" is commonly used, this term is only relevant to the untreated patient. This term is widely used to describe TSH and TH tests even though determinations of these parameters are often used to monitor hypothyroid patients on levo-T4 therapy with no innate thyroid function, patients with hypothalamic or pituitary disease (secondary hypothyroidism), or patients taking medications that affect the pituitary-thyroid axis. In addition, "thyroid function tests" are frequently used for diagnostic and therapeutic monitoring, for example, primary congenital hypothyroidism. Table 3 describes rare causes of perturbation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis.

### Serum thyrotrophin at baseline predicts the natural course of subclinical hyperthyroidism [^112J8kY7]. Clinical Endocrinology (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

Optimal therapeutic strategies for subclinical hyperthyroidism are undecided. Overt disease develops in a minority of cases, but the risk factors for progression remain unclear. We examined whether a baseline thyrotrophin (TSH) predicted progression to overt hyperthyroidism in asymptomatic individuals with subclinical hyperthyroidism.

Design, Patients and Measurements

This was a retrospective study of 323 patients with subclinical hyperthyroidism seen in our institution from 2003 to 2010 (mean age 71 years, males 26·9%, females 73·1%, mean follow-up duration 32 months, range 6–93 months). Serum TSH and free thyroxine (FT4) were documented at baseline and during follow-up. After excluding individuals with nonthyroid causes of low TSH, patients were grouped according to initial TSH as: TSH 0·10–0·39 mU/l (grade I) and TSH < 0·10 mU/l (grade II).

Results

Only 38 patients (11·8%) developed overt hyperthyroidism with annual progression rates of 0·6–3·7%. Most patients reverted to normal thyroid status (31·6%) or remained subclinically hyperthyroid (56·7%). Progression to frank hyperthyroidism was higher in grade II than in grade I patients (20·3% vs 6·8%, P < 0·001, Chi square test). Kaplan-Meier curves showed faster progression rates in grade II than grade I (P < 0·001, log rank test). In stepwise multivariate Cox regression analysis, TSH < 0·1 mU/l was associated with overt hyperthyroidism (hazard ratio 3·4, confidence interval 1·6–7·0), whereas age, gender, FT4 and aetiological diagnosis were not associated with hyperthyroidism.

Conclusions

Thyrotrophin predicts overt hyperthyroidism in asymptomatic individuals with subclinical hyperthyroidism. Patients with TSH < 0·10 mU/l have a higher risk of progressing to hyperthyroidism than those with TSH 0·10–0·39 mU/l.

THE CLINICAL UTILITY OF TSH MEASUREMENT

Serum TSH is one of the most frequently measured analytes in the outpatient setting. Thyroid disease is common and can in most cases be easily diagnosed based on using TSH measurement. In addition, the availability of high quality, sensitive and specific, and inexpensive TSH assays makes screening for thyroid disease cost-effective. Because of the log-linear relationship of TSH to fT4, deviations of TSH concentration from population-specific reference intervals represent the preferred initial test for evaluation of thyroid function.

Understanding the indications for and limitations of TSH measurement and the interpretation of TSH results is essential for the practice of high-quality cost-effective medicine.TSH is used to screen newborns for primary congenital hypothyroidism and to screen adults at risk for thyroid disease. Note that primary congenital hypothyroidism is an endocrine emergency because delays in initiating treatment result in an irreversible loss of cognitive function. Accordingly, turn-around time from specimen collection to patient follow-up represents a major consideration in the implementation and quality assessment of newborn screening programs.

Interpreting the results for these apparently similar indications for TSH measurement is, however, very different (Box 2). Patient age presents an important factor that must be considered when interpreting TSH results. For example, TSH concentrations in newborns < 3 days of age are difficult to interpret due the postnatal TSH surge. In newborns between the ages of 3 days and 1 month, serum TSH > 20 mIU/L is generally considered as a clinical action limit requiring immediate action. At the other age extreme, in the elderly, the upper bound of the TSH reference interval progressively increases with age and should be reflected in laboratory reports and taken into consideration for clinical interpretation of TSH test results.

Box 2.
Points to Consider for Clinical Thyrotropin Measurements

As well as the initial clinical indication for which TSH is measured, other independent variables must be kept in mind when using and interpreting TSH measurements. Human thyroid function is affected by nutritional, environmental, geographical, genetic, and various (patho-)physiological endogenous or exogenous factors. These include population-specific iodine intake, patient age and sex, biological variation, reproductive status, ethnicity, and the assay method used (see Comparability and Quality Assessment of fT4 and TSH Assays section).

### When to begin treatment in patients with elevated TSH… [^114Ch9kj]. AAFP (2002). Low credibility.

to the editor: I read with interest your article, "Treatment of Hypothyroidism. " 1 I found the article informative, but I do have one disagreement. Dr. Hueston's discussion of "subclinical hypothyroidism" suggests that patients with thyroid-stimulating hormone levels between 6 and 10 may not progress to overt hypothyroidism and do not necessarily need to be treated. The author recommends an "individualized" approach and gives several parameters to aid in decision-making. One important factor is missing from this discussion: the lipid panel. Patients with "mild thyroid failure" usually have dyslipidemia, which may be improved with thyroid hormone replacement. Indeed, mild hypothyroidism is a risk factor for atherosclerosis.

In summary, I consider patients with an elevated TSH level as having hypothyroidism, and patients with normal free thyroxine level as having mild thyroid failure, which is a real condition. Why should physicians wait to treat these patients until they, if ever, progress to worse disease. Early treatment is beneficial, especially considering the lipid profile that results from an elevated TSH level. 1 on hypothyroidism in AFP. The issue of small elevations of thyroid-stimulating hormone with normal thyroxine levels is still controversial. While it is recognized that hypothyroidism is clearly associated with elevations in cholesterol, 2 there are no population-based data showing that persons with subclinical hypothyroidism are more likely to have higher cholesterol levels.

Treatment studies of thyroid in this population have had only a small number of participants, 3–5 included patients with elevated TSH levels after thyroid ablation therapy, 4 and have not compared the effects of thyroid replacement therapy with other treatment modalities for hyperlipidemia, such as statins. So, I do not believe it is clear that the best course of treatment for these patients is thyroid replacement. However, given these limitations, a patient at high risk for cardiac disease treatment for subclinical hypothyroidism with low doses of thyroxine probably carries more benefits than risks.

Summary statement — TSH upper limits across reproductive contexts notes moderate evidence that the laboratory reference range should determine the upper limit of normal for a third-generation TSH assay for pregnant and nonpregnant patients, and when age-based limits are unavailable, defined limits should be used: 4.12 mIU/L for nonpregnant patients and those attempting pregnancy, reduce the upper limit by 0.5 mIU/L for pregnant patients in the first trimester, and use nonpregnant thresholds in the second and third trimesters.

### Clinical parameters are more likely to be associated with thyroid hormone levels than with thyrotropin levels: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116gv3zG]. Thyroid (2020). Medium credibility.

This work addressed diagnosis alone. Extrapolation of our findings appears logical, and there is no apparent a priori reason as to why TSH levels should be preferred over thyroid hormone levels in the context of monitoring thyroid treatments. Randomized trials might, nevertheless, reveal that additional considerations apply in these circumstances. Though there was no suggestion in the studies that we examined of a difference with individuals on thyroid hormone replacement, their numbers were small.

In summary, there is now matching theoretical and empiric evidence from a variety of sources suggesting that the thyroid status of an individual is better defined by thyroid hormone levels than TSH levels. There is evidence of a continuum of thyroid hormone effects along the continuum of thyroid hormone levels, with a possible optimum around the middle of the reference range. Though TSH levels remain good screening tests for overt thyroid dysfunction, it is theoretically and empirically more sound to rely on thyroid hormone and especially fT4 levels to classify the thyroid state.

This work should result in a simplification of the understanding of thyroid physiology and pathophysiology, and bring it more into line with the understanding of the physiology and pathophysiology of other parameters, whereby the status of a parameter is judged by its level rather than the level of any controlling factor. Reconsideration of the TSH-based diagnostic approach to thyroid function appears to be indicated. In turn, this would appear to have implications for clinical guidelines, research methodology, and the rationale of underlying physiological principles.

Conclusions — practice implications and laboratory–clinician interface: over the past five decades, testing for TSH and thyroid hormones (T4 and T3) has greatly improved in selectivity and sensitivity. Physicians and laboratorians must understand the limitations of TH measurement, and there is a need for a stronger laboratory–clinician interface. Laboratories often receive requests missing clinical and pharmacological information; the laboratory should educate physicians regarding test limitations and interpretations and should notify physicians before changing methods and reference ranges. Standardization, quality, performance, and harmonization of assays (TSH, T4, T3) need to be maintained and improved to enable exchange, application, and interpretation of test results within clinical standards.

Context

Patients with serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels outside the reference range and levels of free thyroxine (FT4) and triiodothyronine (T3) within the reference range are common in clinical practice. The necessity for further evaluation, possible treatment, and the urgency of treatment have not been clearly established.

Objectives

To define subclinical thyroid disease, review its epidemiology, recommend an appropriate evaluation, explore the risks and benefits of treatment and consequences of nontreatment, and determine whether population-based screening is warranted.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, EMBASE, Biosis, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, National Guideline Clearing House, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and Controlled Trials Register, and several National Health Services (UK) databases were searched for articles on subclinical thyroid disease published between 1995 and 2002. Articles published before 1995 were recommended by expert consultants.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

A total of 195 English-language or translated papers were reviewed. Editorials, individual case studies, studies enrolling fewer than 10 patients, and nonsystematic reviews were excluded. Information related to authorship, year of publication, number of subjects, study design, and results were extracted and formed the basis for an evidence report, consisting of tables and summaries of each subject area.

Data Synthesis

The strength of the evidence that untreated subclinical thyroid disease is associated with clinical symptoms and adverse clinical outcomes was assessed and recommendations for clinical practice developed. Data relating the progression of subclinical to overt hypothyroidism were rated as good, but data relating treatment to prevention of progression were inadequate to determine a treatment benefit. Data relating a serum TSH level higher than 10 mIU/L to elevations in serum cholesterol were rated as fair but data relating to benefits of treatment were rated as insufficient. All other associations of symptoms and benefit of treatment were rated as insufficient or absent. Data relating a serum TSH concentration lower than 0.1 mIU/L to the presence of atrial fibrillation and progression to overt hyperthyroidism were rated as good, but no data supported treatment to prevent these outcomes. Data relating restoration of the TSH level to within the reference range with improvements in bone mineral density were rated as fair. Data addressing all other associations of subclinical hyperthyroid disease and adverse clinical outcomes or treatment benefits were rated as insufficient or absent. Subclinical hypothyroid disease in pregnancy is a special case and aggressive case finding and treatment in pregnant women can be justified.

Conclusions

Data supporting associations of subclinical thyroid disease with symptoms or adverse clinical outcomes or benefits of treatment are few. The consequences of subclinical thyroid disease (serum TSH 0.1–0.45 mIU/L or 4.5–10.0 mIU/L) are minimal and we recommend against routine treatment of patients with TSH levels in these ranges. There is insufficient evidence to support population-based screening. Aggressive case finding is appropriate in pregnant women, women older than 60 years, and others at high risk for thyroid dysfunction.

### Factors influencing the reference interval of thyroid-stimulating hormone in healthy adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111P4zfx]. Clinical Endocrinology (2021). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Thyroid‐stimulating hormone (TSH) is a glycoprotein hormone secreted by specific basophils in the pituitary gland, which is a specific indicator for evaluating individual thyroid function. Clinically common thyroid diseases include hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, thyroiditis and so on. With improvements in the understanding of thyroid diseases and health examinations, the incidence of thyroid diseases is increasing. Because many patients are asymptomatic or in a subclinical state, and some countries advocate a TSH priority strategy for the diagnosis of thyroid dysfunction, it is important and necessary to establish a reference interval. The reference interval is currently the most widely used tool for medical decision‐making. It is usually defined as the reference value between 2.5% and 97.5%, which is the most important factor in health assessment, disease diagnosis, treatment and prognosis assessment.

Some reports define the lower limit of TSH as 0.2–0.4 mU/L and the upper limit as 4.0–5.0 mU/L, but a much lower upper limit of TSH has previously been suggested based on large population studies. The American Association of Clinical Endocrinologist recommended to decrease the upper limit of TSH to 3.0 mU/L. Many experts even suggest that the upper limit of the range be further reduced to 2.5 mIU/L. In general, the upper limit of the TSH reference interval is an important indicator for the evaluation of hypothyroidism. In contrast, individuals who live in areas with iodine deficiency for long periods of time often develop hyperthyroidism, because their lower limit of TSH reference interval is lower than the normal reference value of the region. The International Federation of Clinical Chemistry (IFCC) and Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) have recommended that each laboratory define their own reference intervalsso that patients with thyroid‐related diseases in different countries can receive screening and diagnosis in a timely manner.

Because TSH is an important indicator for evaluating thyroid function, so the preconditions that may influence the establishment of its reference interval should be considered comprehensively. Some studies based on multi‐population regions have evaluated the TSH reference interval from healthy individuals according to the National Academy of Clinical Biochemistry (NACB) standards, and have noted that the TSH reference interval was influenced by age, sex, race, iodine intake and thyroid autoantibodies. Through comprehensive analysis, this paper mainly discusses the effect of age, sex, iodine intake, sample size, region, assay methods and manufacturers and other factors such as race on the establishment of the TSH reference interval and explains why it is necessary for different countries to establish their own TSH reference intervals.

### Serum thyroid-stimulating hormone measurement for assessment of thyroid function and disease [^115EGDLC]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

Third generation thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) assays have emerged as the single most useful test of thyroid function, and are used widely and appropriately as a screening test. TSH measurement alone may be misleading in complicated patients and those undergoing treatment for thyroid dysfunction. Before obtaining thyroid function tests, clinicians need to consider whether the patient might have pituitary or hypothalamic disease or severe nonthyroidal illness, and whether assessment of the pituitary-thyroid axis reflects steady-state conditions. Subclinical hyperthyroidism is associated with adverse effects on the skeleton and the heart, and is best assessed by measurement of serum TsH with a third-generation assay.

Pregnancy-related thyroid function test interpretation describes that serum TSH levels may be below the nonpregnant reference range in the first half of a normal-term pregnancy, especially in gestational weeks 9–13, and during the second half of pregnancy the lower limit of normal for TSH in the pregnant population can be used. Free T4 and T3 measured in an equilibrium dialysis or an ultrafiltrate of serum may be slightly higher (5%–10%) than nonpregnancy values early in gestation, then gradually decrease so that late third trimester values are lower than in nonpregnant women. Serum total T4 and T3 reference ranges increase at a rate of 5% of nonpregnant values per week over the 10-week period of gestation weeks 7–16, after which this 50% increase stabilizes and reference range limits remain 1.5 times above nonpregnancy ranges over the remaining weeks of pregnancy.

### Subclinical hypothyroidism: deciding when to treat… [^112VJzEn]. AAFP (1998). Low credibility.

Subclinical Hypothyroidism Measurement of serum TSH is generally considered the best screening test for thyroid disease; increased values usually indicate hypothyroidism, and decreased values usually indicate hyperthyroidism. This test has proved to be both sensitive and specific. Its very sensitivity, however, may create a dilemma, since some patients are found to have elevated serum TSH levels, suggesting hypothyroidism, but have normal levels of thyroid hormone, whether measured as free thyroxine or free T 4 index. This state — an elevated TSH level with a normal free T. The presence of symptoms that might be related to mild hypothyroidism also increases the potential benefit of treatment. Risk of harm to the patient, against which this potential benefit must be balanced, is quite small, since the use of the sensitive TSH assay provides assurance that we are not raising the blood thyroid hormone levels too much as long as TSH levels do not fall below the normal range.

In patients with coronary artery disease and minimal elevations of TSH, however, it may be advisable to follow the TSH level rather than subject the patient to the small risk of levothyroxine therapy. In short, it seems reasonable to treat patients who have a TSH level that is consistently elevated above 10 μU per mL, especially if titers of antithyroid antibodies are increased. Also, patients who complain of fatigue, dry skin, constipation, muscle cramps or other common symptoms of hypothyroidism may possibly benefit from treatment even if their TSH level is elevated only into the 5 to 10 μU per mL range. An algorithm summarizing this approach is presented in Figure 1. Patients with subclinical hypothyroidism, because of the minimal extent of the thyroid hormone deficiency, may be controlled with total daily dosages of levothyroxine as low as 25 to 50 μg.

This initial dosage should be maintained for six to eight weeks before a TSH measurement is repeated to guide adjustment of the levothyroxine dosage. The goal is to maintain the TSH level within normal limits; the dosage of levothyroxine should be increased if the TSH level remains above normal and should be decreased if the TSH level falls below normal. Once the correct dosage of thyroxine is established, the frequency of TSH measurement may be decreased to every six to 12 months.

### Thyroid dysfunction and anemia: a prospective cohort study and a systematic review [^111LcuuE]. Thyroid (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Even though the association between thyroid dysfunction and anemia is commonly described, it is not known whether it is clinically relevant. This study set out to quantify the association of thyroid dysfunction on hemoglobin (Hb) concentration and risk of anemia. A systematic review (MEDLINE and EMBASE, from inception until May 15, 2017) was conducted to interpret the findings in context.

Methods

Participants from the EPIC-Norfolk cohort with available baseline thyrotropin (TSH), free thyroxine (fT4), and Hb were included. Euthyroidism was defined as TSH 0.45–4.49mIU/L (reference category), hypothyroidism as TSH ≥ 4.50mIU/L (subclinical [SHypo] with normal fT4 or overt [OHypo] with low fT4), and hyperthyroidism as TSH ≤ 0.44mIU/L (subclinical [SHyper] with normal fT4 or overt [OHyper] with elevated fT4). Anemia was defined as Hb < 12g/dL in women and Hb < 13g/dL in men. In the cross-sectional analyses, multiple linear regression was used to compare Hb across TSH categories. In the prospective analysis, participants with OHypo/OHyper at baseline were excluded, as it was assumed that they were treated for overt thyroid disease. A covariance model was used to determine change in Hb concentration from baseline to last follow-up, and multivariable Cox regression was used to analyze anemia risk.

Results

In the cross-sectional population (n = 12,337), the adjusted Hb was 0.22g/dL lower [confidence interval (CI) 0.07–0.38] in OHypo compared to euthyroids, and 0.08g/dL lower [CI -0.23 to 0.38] in OHyper. In the prospective analysis, 460/7031 participants developed anemia over a median follow-up of 4.7 years. The adjusted mean Hb change over time was -0.04g/dL in SHypo [CI -0.14 to 0.06] and 0.05g/dL in SHyper [CI -0.10 to 0.20]. The adjusted hazard ratio for anemia was 0.99 [CI 0.67–1.48] in SHypo, and 0.52 [CI 0.23–1.16] in SHyper. The systematic review returned no other prospective studies on this association, but cross-sectional and case-control studies showed comparable results.

Conclusion

In this first prospective population-based cohort, subclinical thyroid dysfunction was not associated with a change in Hb concentration during follow-up and was not an independent risk factor for developing anemia; variations in Hb concentration in patients with overt thyroid dysfunction were not clinically relevant.

### Low thyroid-stimulating hormone and its persistence beyond the first trimester of pregnancy [^115pbrgL]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate predictors of low thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) persisting beyond the first trimester and associated pregnancy outcomes.

Methods

We retrospectively assessed the association between low first-trimester TSH and obstetric outcomes of singleton pregnancies in southern Israel between 2001 and 2011. We included women with first-trimester TSH and at least one other THS measurement. Clinical data were from maternity and community medical records.

Results

Among 3761 women, 185 (4.9%) had a TSH of 0.10 mIU/L or less in the first trimester. Multiple of the median human chorionic gonadotropin was higher in women with TSH of 0.40 mIU/L or less versus 0.41–4.0 mIU/L, but was not associated with higher rates of persistent low TSH. Maternal age (odds ratio [OR] 1.08, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.00–1.16; per yearly increment), free thyroxine (FT4; OR 1.11, 95% CI 1.03–1.20; per ng/dL increment), and TSH of 0.10 mIU/L or less (OR 3.06, 95% CI 1.38–6.80 vs 0.21–0.40 mIU/L) were independent predictors of persistent low TSH. No adverse pregnancy outcomes occurred in women with low first-trimester TSH.

Conclusions

Low TSH persisting beyond the first trimester was more common with increasing maternal age, elevated FT4, and TSH below 0.10 mIU/L, but was not associated with obstetric complications.

### How should we treat patients with low serum thyrotropin concentrations? [^116SUZCg]. Clinical Endocrinology (2010). Low credibility.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism (SH) is defined by a low serum thyrotropin (TSH) concentration in the presence of normal levels of free thyroxine (FT4) and free triiodothyronine (FT3). However, it is helpful to distinguish between those with a detectable but low TSH value (in the 0.1–0.4 mU/l range) and those with a fully suppressed TSH (< 0.1 mU/l), and we suggest the designation of grade I and grade II SH, respectively. Together, these patterns of thyroid function tests are found in 1–3% of the elderly population, and are associated with significant morbidity and mortality in longitudinal epidemiological surveys. There are a number of causes for this picture, which include endogenous thyroid disease, drug effects and concomitant nonthyroidal illness. Treatments commonly employed in the management of thyrotoxicosis are effective at correcting the biochemical abnormalities of SH but have not been shown to improve clinical outcome or symptoms. There is little good quality evidence available to guide the assessment or management of these patients. This review summarizes the clinical significance of SH and aims to provide guidance about whether we should treat patients with low serum TSH concentrations.

Thyroid dysfunction definitions — subclinical hyperthyroidism involves TSH below the thyroid reference interval (usually 0.4 mIU/L) with normal T4 and triiodothyronine (T3) levels, and it is further classified as low but detectable (about 0.1 to 0.4 mIU/L) or undetectable (< 0.1 mIU/L) TSH levels; despite its name, overt hyperthyroidism does not require symptoms and is defined biochemically by a low or undetectable TSH level and an elevated T4 or T3 level.
