## Question

A 34-year-old man presents to the emergency department with a 2-week history of headache, low-grade fever, and progressive confusion. On examination, he is febrile, has neck stiffness, and a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 12. Brain MRI shows basal meningeal enhancement and mild hydrocephalus. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis reveals elevated protein, low glucose, and lymphocytic pleocytosis. Acid-fast bacilli are seen on CSF smear. The neurology team diagnoses tuberculous meningitis. The team is considering adjunctive therapies to improve outcomes.

According to current guidelines, what adjunctive pharmacologic therapy should be initiated in this patient with tuberculous meningitis, and for how long should it be continued?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which adjunctive pharmacologic therapy should be initiated for tuberculous meningitis and for how long it should be continued. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical scenario and whether it meets criteria for tuberculous meningitis. Then, I should verify which adjunctive therapy has the strongest evidence and guideline support. Next, I will check dosing, duration, and whether HIV status changes the recommendation. After that, I should review alternatives like aspirin and why they are not first-line. Finally, I will synthesize a clear, actionable recommendation with caveats and monitoring needs.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and severity. The patient has a 2-week prodrome with headache, fever, neck stiffness, and altered mental status, plus CSF lymphocytic pleocytosis with low glucose and AFB on smear, and MRI showing basal meningeal enhancement with hydrocephalus, which together support tuberculous meningitis and place him at least at MRC grade II given GCS 12, indicating moderate severity [^1118s6Ep].

> Now, I need to identify the adjunctive therapy with the strongest evidence. Multiple high-quality sources converge on adjunctive corticosteroids as the only adjunct with proven mortality benefit in TBM, with a Cochrane meta-analysis showing about a 25% reduction in short-term mortality and consistent benefit across ages, while not clearly reducing long-term disability, and this is echoed by WHO and ATS/CDC/IDSA guidelines recommending corticosteroids for TBM [^113Pbjhf] [^114qz2PJ] [^115A5mh1].

> Wait, let me verify the HIV caveat before I jump to conclusions. Historically, the benefit signal was strongest in HIV-negative patients, and early trials included few people with HIV, so the net effect in HIV-positive adults remained uncertain. However, a large 2023 NEJM RCT in HIV-positive adults did not show a statistically significant survival benefit for dexamethasone, which tempers enthusiasm in that subgroup even though guidelines still allow corticosteroids with caution and attention to ART interactions and IRIS risk [^117YFbNT] [^113HFdrv] [^112VAKLf].

> I should confirm the specific agent and dosing. Dexamethasone is the most consistently studied and recommended corticosteroid. Practical regimens use 0.3–0.4 mg/kg/day, often IV initially, with tapering over 6–8 weeks, and severity-based adjustments are reasonable, with the pivotal trial and contemporary guidelines aligning with this approach and neurocritical care statements endorsing universal use in TBM regardless of severity at presentation [^114juAYE] [^115A5mh1] [^117FDvTU].

> Hold on, I should verify duration and taper details. The standard course is 6–8 weeks total, typically with IV therapy for the first 2–4 weeks followed by oral therapy with a gradual taper to avoid rebound inflammation. The NEJM HIV-positive trial used a 6–8 week tapering course modeled on the earlier effective regimen, and WHO guidance explicitly recommends tapering over 6–8 weeks, which fits this patient's moderate severity profile [^1178ZiAu] [^114qz2PJ].

> Let me consider alternatives and why they are not first-line. Aspirin has been studied and shows a reduction in new ischemic strokes in TBM but does not reduce mortality; given bleeding risk and the lack of a survival signal, aspirin is not recommended as routine adjunctive therapy pending larger trials, so it should not replace corticosteroids in initial management [^112pc8e8] [^111iA9Hq]. Thalidomide and other TNF-alpha blockers have been explored in small studies or case series but are not standard due to toxicity or insufficient evidence, reinforcing that corticosteroids remain the only guideline-endorsed adjunctive pharmacotherapy at this time [^114g6dbE] [^115gvK5L].

> I should double-check that I'm not missing any competing anti-inflammatory strategies. Host-directed therapy is an active research area, and trials of infliximab or genotype-guided corticosteroid personalization are underway, but these remain investigational and should not be used outside trials, so they do not alter current standard-of-care recommendations for this patient [^116QWLdF] [^113WGN16].

> Putting this together, my recommendation is to initiate adjunctive dexamethasone promptly, using 0.3–0.4 mg/kg/day IV for the first 2–4 weeks, then transition to oral therapy and taper the total duration to 6–8 weeks, adjusting the taper to clinical response and complications such as hydrocephalus or IRIS. This aligns with WHO, ATS/CDC/IDSA, and neurocritical care guidance and is the only adjunct with proven mortality benefit in TBM, while acknowledging that the magnitude of benefit in HIV-positive patients is uncertain and requires individualized risk–benefit assessment and ART coordination [^114qz2PJ] [^115A5mh1] [^117FDvTU] [^117YFbNT].

---

The recommended adjunctive pharmacologic therapy for tuberculous meningitis is **dexamethasone** [^115A5mh1] [^114qz2PJ] at 0.3–0.4 mg/kg/day (max 16 mg/day) for 2–4 weeks, then taper by 0.1 mg/kg per week until 0.1 mg/kg/day, then 4 mg/day and taper by 1 mg/week for a total of 12 weeks [^111hYnoP]. This regimen is supported by WHO and IDSA/ATS/CDC guidelines and reduces mortality in HIV-negative patients [^113Pbjhf]; **benefit in HIV-positive patients is uncertain** [^117YFbNT], so use clinical judgment and monitor closely [^113HFdrv]. Aspirin is **not routinely recommended** [^112pc8e8] due to insufficient evidence of mortality benefit, though it may reduce stroke risk [^111iA9Hq].

---

## Evidence supporting adjunctive corticosteroid therapy

Multiple randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses demonstrate that **adjunctive corticosteroids reduce mortality** in TBM, particularly in HIV-negative patients [^113Pbjhf] [^114juAYE]. The Cochrane review (2016) found a **significant reduction in mortality** (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.65–0.87) with corticosteroids, with no significant increase in severe adverse events [^113Pbjhf]. However, the effect on neurological disability remains uncertain, with some studies showing no significant improvement in long-term neurological outcomes [^113Pbjhf].

---

## Recommended corticosteroid regimen

The WHO and IDSA/ATS/CDC recommend **dexamethasone** as the preferred corticosteroid for TBM [^114qz2PJ] [^115A5mh1]. The recommended regimen is:

- **Initial dose**: 0.3–0.4 mg/kg/day (maximum 16 mg/day) for 2–4 weeks [^111hYnoP].
- **Tapering**: Reduce the dose by 0.1 mg/kg per week until reaching 0.1 mg/kg/day, then continue at 4 mg/day and taper by 1 mg/week for a total duration of 12 weeks [^111hYnoP].

This regimen balances the anti-inflammatory benefits of corticosteroids with the potential risks associated with prolonged steroid use, such as immunosuppression and metabolic side effects [^112FTbvg].

---

## Special considerations in HIV-positive patients

The benefit of adjunctive corticosteroids in HIV-positive patients with TBM remains uncertain [^117YFbNT]. A recent randomized controlled trial in HIV-positive adults did not demonstrate a significant survival benefit with dexamethasone compared to placebo [^117YFbNT]. Therefore, **clinical judgment should guide corticosteroid use** in HIV-positive patients, with careful monitoring for potential adverse effects and interactions with antiretroviral therapy [^113HFdrv].

---

## Alternative adjunctive therapies

Aspirin has been explored as an adjunctive therapy to reduce the risk of ischemic stroke in TBM, given the high incidence of cerebrovascular complications [^112pc8e8]. Meta-analyses suggest that aspirin may reduce the incidence of new strokes but does not significantly impact mortality or overall neurological outcomes [^112pc8e8]. Therefore, **aspirin is not currently recommended** as routine adjunctive therapy in TBM pending further robust evidence [^notfound].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Adjunctive therapy** | **Recommendation** | **Duration** |
|-|-|-|
| Dexamethasone | Strongly recommended for HIV-negative patients; use clinical judgment in HIV-positive patients | 12 weeks (including taper) [^111hYnoP] |
| Aspirin | Not routinely recommended; may be considered selectively | Variable (typically 4–8 weeks) |

---

Adjunctive corticosteroid therapy with dexamethasone is the **standard of care** for tuberculous meningitis, particularly in HIV-negative patients [^115A5mh1]. The recommended duration is 12 weeks, including a gradual taper to minimize adverse effects [^111hYnoP]. The role of corticosteroids in HIV-positive patients remains uncertain, and aspirin is not routinely recommended pending further evidence [^117YFbNT] [^112pc8e8].

### A clinical practice guideline for tuberculous meningitis [^112rKvVY]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Tuberculous meningitis is the most severe form of tuberculosis, causing death or disability in around half of those affected. There are no up-to-date international guidelines defining its optimal management. Therefore, the Tuberculous Meningitis International Research Consortium conducted a systematic review of available evidence to address key management questions and to develop practice guidance. The consortium includes representatives from India, Indonesia, South Africa, Uganda, Viet Nam, Australia, the Netherlands, the UK, and the USA. Questions were developed using the Population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcome (PICO) format for tuberculous meningitis diagnosis, anti-tuberculosis chemotherapy, adjunctive anti-inflammatory therapy, and neurocritical and neurosurgical care. A Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations approach was used to assess the certainty (or quality) of evidence and establish the direction and strength of recommendations for each PICO-based question. We provide evidence-based recommendations for the optimal treatment and diagnosis of tuberculous meningitis, alongside expert opinion. We expose substantial knowledge and evidence gaps, thereby highlighting current research priorities.

Summary

Tuberculous meningitis (TBM) causes death or disability in approximately 50% of those affected and kills approximately 78200 adults every year. Antimicrobial treatment is based on regimens used for pulmonary tuberculosis which overlooks important differences between lung and brain drug distributions. TBM has a profound inflammatory component, yet only adjunctive corticosteroids have shown clear benefit. There is an active pipeline of new antitubercular drugs, and the advent of biological agents targeted at specific inflammatory pathways promise a new era of improved TBM treatment and outcomes. Yet, to date, TBM trials have been relatively small, underpowered, heterogeneous, poorly generalizable, and have had little impact on policy and practice. Progress is slow, and a new approach is required. Here, a global consortium of TBM researchers articulate a coordinated, definitive way ahead via globally conducted clinical trials of novel drugs and regimens to advance treatment and improve outcomes from this life-threatening infection.

### Safety and tolerability of a short course of linezolid for the treatment of predominantly moderate to severe tuberculous meningitis in adults with human immunodeficiency virus [^112Lu6A6]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Tuberculous meningitis (TBM) is universally fatal without treatment. Even among patients who receive recommended therapy, 25%–50% will die. In those who survive, neurologic disability is common. Despite these poor outcomes, there is a paucity of data on how to optimize antituberculosis therapy for TBM, including for people living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The highest proportion of deaths occurs within the first month after treatment initiation, suggesting that there may be a critical window early in the disease course during which enhanced treatment could have the greatest impact on clinical outcomes.

In the absence of compelling data to guide treatment, the same standard drug regimens and dosing used for pulmonary tuberculosis are empirically used for TBM, except with a longer continuation phase to complete 9–12 months of therapy. This approach assumes that the efficacy of tuberculosis drugs is equivalent at all sites of infection, disregarding the unique challenges of infection of the central nervous system (CNS). Effective drugs for TBM must penetrate the blood-brain barrier and remain in the CNS to achieve bactericidal drug concentrations for an adequate duration. At standard dosing recommended in current guidelines, rifampin, a key drug in the treatment of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, seldom reaches minimal inhibitory concentrations for M. tuberculosis in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which may jeopardize treatment efficacy in TBM.

Several recently completed or ongoing clinical trials are investigating the effect of high-dose rifampin on mortality rates in TBM. However, even in one small trial that suggested a favorable effect of high-dose rifampin on the treatment of TBM, the mortality rate still exceeded 33% in the experimental arm, arguing that additional drugs may be needed to augment the potential benefit of high-dose rifampin. Adjunctive linezolid, given for the first month of treatment of TBM, may enhance bactericidal activity during the rapid growth phase of M. tuberculosis while minimizing toxicity. In observational studies, the addition of linezolid to treat TBM in adults and children has been associated with better neurologic outcomes and lower mortality rates.

In the Adjunctive Linezolid for the Treatment of TubERculous Meningitis (ALTER) trial, we (1) assessed the safety and tolerability of 4 weeks of linezolid 1200 mg once daily administered with high-dose or standard-dose rifampin and (2) compared mortality rates and functional independence between participants randomized to linezolid versus no linezolid for the treatment of definite or suspected TBM.

Tuberculous meningitis — We recommend that all patients with tuberculous meningitis receive adjunctive corticosteroids regardless of disease severity at presentation (Strength of recommendation A; Quality of evidence I). The regimen should follow those used in recent controlled trials (Strength of recommendation A; Quality of evidence II). Adults (> 14 years) should start treatment with dexamethasone 0.4 mg/kg/ 24 h with a reducing course over 6–8 weeks.

Treatment of tuberculous meningitis — experts suggest treatment for an extended period of 9 to 12 months, but there is no evidence to support this duration; trials suggest potential benefit from higher rifampin doses (up to 30–35 mg/kg/day) or adding fluoroquinolones or linezolid, yet data are limited and insufficient for a clear recommendation. Adjunctive corticosteroid therapy is recommended for all individuals who have TB involving the central nervous system (AII), including those with HIV.

### Aspirin in tuberculous meningitis [^111iA9Hq]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Neurological sequelae in tuberculous meningitis (TBM) lead to significant morbidity and mortality. Stroke is common, occurring in 15–57% of cases and associated with poor outcome. As yet, there are few adjunctive therapies which can prevent often life-threatening complications. Aspirin, a widely available and inexpensive drug, has been considered as adjunctive therapy for some time with the first clinical trial of aspirin in TBM taking place over a decade ago. In this issue of EClinicalMedicine, Rohilla and colleagues present results from a meta-analysis of the three randomised controlled trials (RCT) including 365 patients receiving aspirin as adjunctive therapy in TBM. They conclude that although there is no mortality benefit, aspirin reduces stroke, which may have implications for clinical management of TBM. However, as exemplified by this meta-analysis by differing dosing regimens and choice of clinical endpoints, there is a lack of consensus what dose and duration of aspirin may be optimal.

Adjunctive Anti-inflammatory Therapy

TBM studies should describe the type, dose, route of administration, and duration of anti-inflammatory therapy used (Table 3). Adjunctive corticosteroids are currently recommended for all HIV-uninfected TBM patients during the first 6–8 weeks of treatment; they are also used in HIV-infected patients, although the evidence of benefit is much less clear. Corticosteroids are also often used for the management of tuberculomas and IRIS in HIV-infected patients, although the evidence base is weak. Some patients who do not respond to corticosteroids may benefit from other agents, such as thalidomide or anti–tumor necrosis factor-α biologic agents. Two small studies also suggest that aspirin may reduce cerebral infarcts, but this has not been confirmed in larger-scale studies.

Management of Hydrocephalus

As a minimum, the presence of hydrocephalus assessed by brain CT or MRI should be documented at the start of treatment. An assessment of whether the hydrocephalus is communicating or noncommunicating is desirable, and the management (medical or surgical) should be documented (Table 3). Raised intracranial pressure, largely due to hydrocephalus, is a common problem in patients with TBM. If untreated, hydrocephalus can exacerbate the cerebral ischemia caused by perfusion-limiting vasculitis, which is a key feature of TBM. Untreated hydrocephalus is independently associated with death. Whether the hydrocephalus is communicating or noncommunicating has important management implications. At present, the only way to reliably differentiate communicating from noncommunicating hydrocephalus is with an air encephalogram or using contrast ventriculography. Performing an air encephalogram does not require any special resources and can be performed when collecting a CSF sample. Ventricular shunting is usually indicated for noncommunicating hydrocephalus, while a combination of diuretics (acetazolamide and furosemide) may treat communicating hydrocephalus; the value of this approach requires further confirmation in adults.

### Poor prognosis of HIV-associated tuberculous meningitis regardless of the timing of antiretroviral therapy [^112F8z11]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

(See the article by Török et al, on pages.)

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)–associated tuberculosis (TB) carries a high mortality risk and accounts for approximately 25% of global HIV/AIDS deaths each year. Case management requires a combination of appropriate antituberculosis treatment, antiretroviral therapy (ART), and trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole prophylaxis against other opportunistic infections. ART reduces mortality by 64%–95% in patients with drug-susceptible TB, and trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole prophylaxis halves mortality risk. For patients with HIV-associated TB involving the central nervous system (CNS) or pericardium, adjunctive treatment with corticosteroids is also recommended.

Despite the clear benefits of ART, the optimal time to initiate ART during TB treatment has remained unclear, since this is associated with a complex series of competing risks that may vary between different settings and patient populations. However, the cumulative findings from observational studies and more recent randomized controlled trials indicate that delays in ART initiation are associated with increased mortality among patients with TB across a wide spectrum of baseline CD4+ cell counts. With this growing evidence base, the World Health Organization (WHO) has revised the ART guidelines for resource-limited settings on several occasions between 2002 and 2010, recommending progressively earlier initiation of ART during TB treatment. The most recent revision of these guidelines, published in 2010, recommended that ART be given to all patients with TB regardless of CD4+ cell count, should be started as soon as possible after TB treatment is tolerated, and should not be initiated later than after 8 weeks of TB treatment. However, these guidelines may be further refined as data emerge from additional trials being conducted in different settings and patient groups.

### Corticosteroids for managing tuberculous meningitis [^113Pbjhf]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Abstract

Background

Tuberculous meningitis is a serious form of tuberculosis (TB) that affects the meninges that cover a person's brain and spinal cord. It is associated with high death rates and with disability in people who survive. Corticosteroids have been used as an adjunct to antituberculous drugs to treat people with tuberculous meningitis, but their role has been controversial.

Objectives

To evaluate the effects of corticosteroids as an adjunct to antituberculous treatment on death and severe disability in people with tuberculous meningitis.

Search methods

We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register up to the 18 March 2016; CENTRAL; MEDLINE; EMBASE; LILACS; and Current Controlled Trials. We also contacted researchers and organizations working in the field, and checked reference lists.

Selection criteria

Randomized controlled trials that compared corticosteroid plus antituberculous treatment with antituberculous treatment alone in people with clinically diagnosed tuberculous meningitis and included death or disability as outcome measures.

Data collection and analysis

We independently assessed search results and methodological quality, and extracted data from the included trials. We analysed the data using risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and used a fixed‐effect model. We performed an intention‐to‐treat analysis, where we included all participants randomized to treatment in the denominator. This analysis assumes that all participants who were lost to follow‐up have good outcomes. We carried out a sensitivity analysis to explore the impact of the missing data.

Main results

Nine trials that included 1337 participants (with 469 deaths) met the inclusion criteria.

At follow‐up from three to 18 months, steroids reduce deaths by almost one quarter (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.87; nine trials, 1337 participants, high quality evidence). Disabling neurological deficit is not common in survivors, and steroids may have little or no effect on this outcome (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.20; eight trials, 1314 participants, low quality evidence). There was no difference between groups in the incidence of adverse events, which included gastrointestinal bleeding, invasive bacterial infections, hyperglycaemia, and liver dysfunction.

One trial followed up participants for five years. The effect on death was no longer apparent at this time‐point (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.12; one trial, 545 participants, moderate quality evidence); and there was no difference in disabling neurological deficit detected (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.69; one trial, 545 participants, low quality evidence).

One trial included human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)‐positive people. The stratified analysis by HIV status in this trial showed no heterogeneity, with point estimates for death (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.20; one trial, 98 participants) and disability (RR 1.23, 95% CI 0.08 to 19.07; one trial, 98 participants) similar to HIV‐negative participants in the same trial.

Authors' conclusions

Corticosteroids reduce mortality from tuberculous meningitis, at least in the short term.

Corticosteroids may have no effect on the number of people who survive tuberculous meningitis with disabling neurological deficit, but this outcome is less common than death, and the CI for the relative effect includes possible harm. However, this small possible harm is unlikely to be quantitatively important when compared to the reduction in mortality.

The number of HIV‐positive people included in the review is small, so we are not sure if the benefits in terms of reduced mortality are preserved in this group of patients.

Disseminated tuberculosis — treatment approach and when to apply CNS guidance: Based on expert opinion, a standard daily 6-month regimen is adequate for tuberculosis at multiple sites including miliary disease, though controlled trial data are limited; some experts believe concurrent corticosteroids are indicated for severe respiratory failure or adrenal insufficiency. Patients may have indolent CNS involvement that warrants workup, and recommendations for tuberculous meningitis are followed when CNS involvement is present.

### Tuberculous meningitis: many questions, too few answers [^112ndcDW]. The Lancet: Neurology (2005). Medium credibility.

Tuberculous meningitis (TM) is difficult to diagnose and treat; clinical features are non-specific, conventional bacteriology is widely regarded as insensitive, and assessment of newer diagnostic methods is not complete. Treatment includes four drugs, which were developed more than 30 years ago, and prevents death or disability in less than half of patients. Mycobacterium tuberculosis resistant to these drugs threatens a return to the prechemotherapeutic era in which all patients with TM died. Research findings suggest that adjunctive treatment with corticosteroids improve survival but probably do not prevent severe disability, although how or why is not known. There are many important unanswered questions about the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of TM. Here we review the available evidence to answer some of these questions, particularly those on the diagnosis and treatment of TM.

### Advancing the chemotherapy of tuberculous meningitis: a consensus view [^115gvK5L]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Prevent and manage secondary neurological complications

Neurological complications majorly contribute to poor outcome from TBM. Most manifestations, including raised intracranial pressure, hydrocephalus, cerebral infarction, paradoxical reactions, and seizures, are a direct consequence of intracranial inflammation, emphasising the need to prioritise evaluation of more effective anti-inflammatory therapies. However, evidence-based interventions for adjunctive neurocritical care in TBM are also needed. Trials defining the management of these important complications have never been conducted. This is partly because of resource constraints in high burden settings, for example limited access to expertise for ventricular drainage, and because of substantial challenges in trial design and implementation.

Adjunctive corticosteroids for HIV-associated tuberculous meningitis and pericarditis — Adjunctive corticosteroids are still recommended in people with HIV and tuberculosis (TB) meningitis, and dexamethasone should be administered in a dose of 0.3 mg/kg/day to 0.4 mg/kg/day for 2 to 4 weeks, then tapered by 0.1 mg/kg per week until a dose of 0.1 mg/kg is reached, then 4 mg per day and tapered by 1 mg/week for a total duration of 12 weeks (BII). TB involving the central nervous system (CNS) is currently the only organ system manifestation for which corticosteroids are recommended, and adjunctive corticosteroid therapy is not recommended in the treatment of TB pericarditis (AI). In a randomized trial in tuberculous pericarditis, prednisolone administered for 6 weeks was not associated with a significant reduction in the composite endpoint of death, cardiac tamponade, or constrictive pericarditis, and those receiving prednisolone had a higher incidence of some cancers. A Cochrane review similarly found no mortality benefit, and notably, < 20% of people with HIV in the trials analyzed were receiving ART; no trials have compared different doses and treatment durations of adjunctive corticosteroids.

### Clinical performance measures for neurocritical care: a statement for healthcare professionals from the Neurocritical Care Society [^116aSAGn]. Neurocritical Care (2020). High credibility.

Dexamethasone in tuberculous meningitis — performance measure specifies the percentage of adult patients with tuberculous (TB) meningitis who are treated with adjunctive corticosteroids upon initiation of antituberculous treatment. Numerator is adult patients with TB meningitis who are treated with adjunctive corticosteroids upon initiation of antituberculous treatment; the denominator included text matches this description, with exclusions of < 18 years of age, Length of stay > 120 days, contraindication to steroid administration such as systemic fungal infection or hypersensitivity to steroids, HIV positive, Documented Comfort Measures Only status prior to initiation of antituberculous treatment, and Enrollment in a clinical trial that would preclude the use of steroids. Period of assessment is duration of hospital stay. Rationale notes high mortality and morbidity despite antituberculosis drugs, that several guidelines recommend administering adjunctive corticosteroids upon initiation of antituberculosis treatment, that patients do NOT need to have laboratory confirmed TB meningitis before starting antituberculosis or steroid treatment, and that the available evidence supports treatment with steroids as soon as TB meningitis is clinically suspected and empirically treated; a Cochrane review states the "intention-to-treat analysis in clinically diagnosed participants provides assurance that use of corticosteroids on the basis of clinical diagnosis does more good than harm", but although a Cochrane review suggested some short-term mortality benefit in HIV positive patients, the evidence overall is not robust enough to substantiate including HIV positive patients in this measure.

CLINICAL TRIALS

Whilst many questions regarding optimal TBM management remain unanswered, the current TBM research field is dynamic. A search of clinicaltrials.gov and ISRCTN trial registries identified 11 relevant prospective randomized studies or clinical trials in TBM (Table 1). Current trials in TBM can generally be separated into those aiming to optimize Mtb killing, and those using adjunctive therapies to prevent and manage disease complications. The uncertainty surrounding optimal anti-TB chemotherapy regimens and doses in TBM is underlined by the current trial panorama, where optimized anti-TB chemotherapy trials dominate. Given the poor central nervous system penetration of rifampicin, and its importance as a first line therapy, multiple studies of high-dose rifampicin, with or without linezolid, are underway or due to start. High-dose isoniazid therapy in rapid acetylators is also under investigation.

An evidence base is forming for adjunctive aspirin therapy in TBM. Aspirin may reduce the incidence and promote the resolution of TBM-associated brain infarcts, as shown in a recent phase 2 trial of adjunctive aspirin therapy in 120 HIV-uninfected adults with TBM in Vietnam. Large phase 3 trials are required. In the adult LASER-TBM trial (NCT03927313), high-dose rifampicin and linezolid will be trialed with or without 1000 mg adjunctive aspirin for 8 weeks. In the SURE trial (ISRCTN40829906), children with TBM will be randomized to 6 or 12-month anti-TB chemotherapy, and will also undergo a second randomization to aspirin 20 mg/kg or placebo. Adjunctive dexamethasone is now commonly used in HIV-uninfected individuals with TBM. Whether all HIV-uninfected individuals with TBM should receive corticosteroids, and whether there is benefit in HIV co-infected individuals, is currently under investigation. LAST ACT (NCT03100786) is the first study to personalize anti-inflammatory therapy in TBM by host leukotriene A4 hydrolase genotype.

### Advancing the chemotherapy of tuberculous meningitis: a consensus view [^115HbQwE]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Tuberculous meningitis (TBM) is the most severe form of tuberculosis, causing death or disability in 50% of those affected. An estimated 78,200 adult deaths result from TBM annually, with 35% of these in people living with HIV/AIDS (PWH). Despite such poor patient outcomes, little progress has been made over the last 40 years to identify evidence-based therapies and strategies that reduce death and disability from TBM; the exception being trials demonstrating that adjunctive corticosteroids reduce death in HIV-negative adults and children with TBM.

Randomised controlled trials (RCT) in TBM are urgently required. This urgency comes at a time of opportunity for improving patient outcomes: the pipeline of new antitubercular drugs is more active than it has been for 50 years, and the advent of biological agents targeted at specific inflammatory molecules or pathways (e.g. TNF), both promise a new era of improved TBM therapy. Yet, to date, TBM trials have been relatively small, underpowered, heterogeneous, poorly generalisable, and have had little impact on policy. Progress is slow, and a new approach is due.

Recognising TBM to be a neglected form of tuberculosis, the Tuberculous Meningitis International Research Consortium was established in 2009. The consortium has contributed several reviews on aspects of epidemiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and management of TBM –. Membership includes over 100 researchers and TBM trial centres in India, Indonesia, Madagascar, South Africa, Uganda, and Vietnam. At consortium meetings in Oxford (2022) and in Cape Town (2023), a new approach to TBM trials and therapeutic development was conceived. A working group was formed, seeking to reach consensus agreement on the design, execution, and funding of future TBM clinical trials. This personal view summarises current knowledge on the therapeutic landscape for TBM, articulates a consensus view on research priorities, and sets out recommendations to accelerate improvements in TBM outcomes through globally conducted clinical trials.

Adjunctive treatment — corticosteroids for tuberculous meningitis (TBM) and selected complications — is indicated for children with TBM (strong, moderate) and "can also be considered" for severe immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS), airway compression, pleural effusion, or pericarditis (expert opinion); adjunctive corticosteroid use "appears to reduce long-term constrictive complications in TB pericarditis" and is "associated with more rapid symptom resolution in TB pleural effusion (relative indication)". Prednisone (1–2 mg/kg body weight/day) for 4 to 6 weeks is advisable, with tapered dosing during the final 2 weeks, and evidence suggests corticosteroids in TBM "reduces mortality and long-term neurologic impairment".

Abstract

Background

Tuberculous meningitis (TBM) is the main form of tuberculosis that affects the central nervous system and is associated with high rates of death and disability. Most international guidelines recommend longer antituberculous treatment (ATT) regimens for TBM than for pulmonary tuberculosis disease to prevent relapse. However, longer regimens are associated with poor adherence, which could contribute to increased relapse, development of drug resistance, and increased costs to patients and healthcare systems.

Objectives

To compare the effects of short‐course (six months) regimens versus prolonged‐course regimens for people with tuberculous meningitis (TBM).

Search methods

We searched the following databases up to 31 March 2016: the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), published in the Cochrane Library; MEDLINE; EMBASE; LILACS; INDMED; and the South Asian Database of Controlled Clinical Trials. We searched the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov for ongoing trials. We also checked article reference lists and contacted researchers in the field.

Selection criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and prospective cohort studies of adults and children with TBM treated with antituberculous regimens that included rifampicin for six months or longer than six months. The primary outcome was relapse, and included studies required a minimum of six months follow‐up after completion of treatment.

Data collection and analysis

Two review authors (SJ and HR) independently assessed the literature search results for eligibility, and performed data extraction and 'Risk of bias' assessments of the included studies. We contacted study authors for additional information when necessary. Most data came from single arm cohort studies without a direct comparison so we pooled the findings for each group of cohorts and presented them separately using a complete‐case analysis. When a study reported more than one cohort, the cohorts were analysed separately. We assessed the quality of the evidence narratively, as using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was inappropriate with no direct comparisons between short‐ and prolonged‐course regimens.

Main results

Four RCTs, 13 prospective cohort studies, and one unpublished ongoing cohort study met our inclusion criteria, and included a total of 2098 participants with TBM. None of the included RCTs directly compared six months versus longer regimens, so we analysed all data as individual cohorts to obtain relapse rates in each set of cohorts.

We included 20 cohorts reported in 18 studies. One of these was reported separately, leaving 19 cohorts in the main analysis. We included seven cohorts of participants treated for six months with a total of 458 participants. Three studies were conducted in Thailand, two in South Africa, and one each in Ecuador and Papua New Guinea between the 1980s and 2009. We included 12 cohorts of participants treated for longer than six months (ranging from eight to 16 months), with a total of 1423 participants. Four studies were conducted in India, three in Thailand and one each in China, South Africa, Romania, Turkey, and Vietnam, between the late 1970s and 2011. The unpublished ongoing cohort study is conducted in India and included 217 participants.

The proportion of participants classified as having stage III disease (severe) was higher in the cohorts treated for six months (33.2% versus 16.9%), but the proportion with known concurrent HIV was higher in the cohorts treated for longer (0/458 versus 122/1423). Although there were variations in the treatment regimens, most cohorts received isoniazid, rifampicin, and pyrazinamide during the intensive phase.

Investigators achieved follow‐up beyond 18 months after completing treatment in three out of the seven cohorts treated for six months, and five out of the 12 cohorts treated for eight to 16 months. All studies had potential sources of bias in their estimation of the relapse rate, and comparisons between the cohorts could be confounded.

Relapse was an uncommon event across both groups of cohorts (3/369 (0.8%) with six months treatment versus 7/915 (0.8%) with longer), with only one death attributed to relapse in each group.

Overall, the proportion of participants who died was higher in the cohorts treated for longer than six months (447/1423 (31.4%) versus 58/458 (12.7%)). However, most deaths occurred during the first six months in both treatment cohorts, which suggested that the difference in death rate was not directly related to duration of ATT but was due to confounding. Clinical cure was higher in the group of cohorts treated for six months (408/458 (89.1%) versus longer than six months (984/1336 (73.7%)), consistent with the observations for deaths.

Few participants defaulted from treatment with six months treatment (4/370 (1.1%)) versus longer treatment (8/355 (2.3%)), and adherence was not well reported.

Authors' conclusions

In all cohorts most deaths occurred in the first six months; and relapse was uncommon in all participants irrespective of the regimen. Further inferences are probably inappropriate given this is observational data and confounding is likely. These data are almost all from participants who are HIV‐negative, and thus the inferences will not apply to the efficacy and safety of the six months regimens in HIV‐positive people. Well‐designed RCTs, or large prospective cohort studies, comparing six months with longer treatment regimens with long follow‐up periods established at initiation of ATT are needed to resolve the uncertainty regarding the safety and efficacy of six months regimens for TBM.

Tuberculous Meningitis

The panel evaluated the use of corticosteroid treatment in patients with TB meningitis separately from community-acquired bacterial meningitis (Table 1, Questions 9 and 10). Tuberculous meningitis occurs in immunocompromised patients, is more frequent in lower-resource areas, and generally has a higher morbidity and mortality compared to community-acquired bacterial meningitis. The literature search identified a number of RCTs and one meta-analysis, as well as a number of other studies evaluating corticosteroids in TB meningitis. The overall quality of the evidence was moderate (Evidentiary Table 8 of Electronic Supplementary Material).

The meta-analysis by Prasad et al. included 1337 adult and pediatric patients with TB meningitis who received corticosteroids. Studies using a variety of agents and over different durations were also included in this analysis. At 3–18-month follow-up, corticosteroid use reduced mortality by almost 25%, but did not change overall neurological outcomes. These results are consistent with an RCT of moderate quality that evaluated a tapering dose of dexamethasone and found that it reduced mortality, but not neurological deficits. This treatment effect was consistent across subgroups of disease severity and HIV status. Conversely, other randomized trials in TB meningitis have shown no benefit on mortality or morbidity and were confounded by a variety of corticosteroid dosing strategies and agents used across the studies. The duration of corticosteroid therapy ranged from 1 to 8 weeks in these studies, and no definitive treatment duration has emerged from the available evidence. Overall, there is some suggestion that corticosteroids may reduce mortality in patients with tubercular meningitis and the duration of therapy is likely to be much longer than with community-acquired meningitis.

### Efficacy and safety of aspirin as an adjunctive therapy in tubercular meningitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114L6SHN]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

According to the World Health Organization (WHO) September 2018 report, tuberculosis (TB) is one of the top 10 causes of death worldwide and a leading killer of patients who are HIV positive. TB is a global epidemic with 10 million people diagnosed with tuberculosis and 1.5 million died from the disease as per 2018 WHO report. Tubercular meningitis (TBM) an important neuro-infectious condition which leads to high mortality and morbidity with chronic neurological sequelae. One factor with is responsible for high morbidity and mortality in these patients is stroke. Mortality is three times higher in TBM with infarction as compared to without. This could be explained by a hypothesis that TBM is a hypercoagulable state (decrease in protein S, increase in factor VIII leads to prothrombotic state) which could be the reason for ischaemic stroke and neuropathy in these patients. Stroke occurs in around 15 to 57% of TBM patients especially in severe cases and with advanced stage. Of them around 20% of patients have focal neurological deficits. Current recommended therapy in these patients is anti-tubercular therapy along with corticosteroids and supportive care. However, even with best of care the prognosis in these patients is bad with neurological sequelae and high mortality.

### Efficacy and safety of aspirin as an adjunctive therapy in tubercular meningitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111BZCPX]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Aspirin was safe and was well tolerated at both low dose (81 mg) as well as high dose (1000 mg). The studies included did not find any statistically significant difference in GI bleeding, intracranial bleeding and grade 3 or 4 adverse events when compared to placebo. Misra et al. do not provide detailed information on adverse effects separately in aspirin and placebo arms separately so we could not perform analysis of safety data. Also, the studies were not powered to detect these differences.

An earlier meta-analysis by Rizvi et al.showed that aspirin reduces the risk of new infarctions in patients with tubercular meningitis but do not reduce mortality. This meta-analysis had additionally included an open label study in childrenwhich enrolled only patients with severe TBM (stage III) but the diagnosis was unconfirmed. The duration of aspirin was not clearly mentioned in this study. This study also did not include new onset stroke as an outcome although it did include mortality. Due to various shortcomings inclusion of this study into the meta-analysis is likely to reduce the quality of the meta-analysis. Nevertheless, we conducted a sensitivity analysis by including this study by Amin et al.but it did not change the results.

The major limitations of our meta-analysis is that only three randomized controlled trials were included. Since, only three RCTs are available so there is lack of robust data to support the conclusion. Misra et al. do not provide detailed safety information of both groups so we could not perform safety analysis. The other limitation is that the time point of outcome analysis is not uniform across the three studies (Misra et al. analyzed outcome at 3 months; Mai et al. at 2 months and Schoeman et al. at 6 months). The drug, dose and duration of adjunctive medications (aspirin and steroids) across the studies are also different. Also, publication bias could not be assessed because only three studies were included in the meta-analysis.

Although this meta-analysis did not show significant reduction in mortality and composite outcome (mortality and new onset stroke) with aspirin as compared to placebo but there was significant reduction in new onset stroke in aspirin group as compared to placebo which might be of clinical importance in management of patients with tubercular meningitis. Hence, a large well conducted RCT is required to add to existing knowledge and clarify role of aspirin as adjunctive treatment in patients with tubercular meningitis.

Bone, joint, and spinal tuberculosis — regimen duration and role of surgery: Six- to 9-month regimens containing RIF for bone, joint, and spinal tuberculosis are at least as effective as 18-month regimens that do not contain RIF; because response assessment is difficult, some experts favor a 9-month duration and, when extensive orthopedic hardware is present, may extend treatment to 12 months. Several trials found no additional benefit of surgical debridement with chemotherapy compared with chemotherapy alone, and uncomplicated spinal tuberculosis is managed with medical rather than surgical treatment. Based on expert opinion, surgery can be considered when there is no response to chemotherapy with evidence of ongoing infection or deterioration, when relief of cord compression is needed due to persistent or recurrent neurologic deficits, or when there is spinal instability; spinal tuberculosis with evidence of meningitis is managed as tuberculous meningitis, including consideration of adjunctive corticosteroid use.

Axial, coronal, and sagittal computed tomography scan of C1/C2 showing periodontoid calcifications. A 53-year-old man presented with 2 weeks of back pain, stiff neck, headache, and fevers. He also reported 3 days of right knee pain and swelling. He had a history of pseudogout and kidney transplant 13 years ago. He was taking sirolimus and prednisone, with excellent graft function. His temperature on presentation was 102°F. He had nuchal rigidity and positive Kernig sign. There were no focal neurologic deficits and no spinal tenderness. He had a right knee effusion without erythema and with full range of motion. Laboratory workup of serum showed a white blood cell count of 10 200/μL and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, 63 mm/h; workup of cerebrospinal fluid showed a WBC count of 0/μL; red blood cell count, 32/μL; total protein level, 109 mg/dL; and glucose level, 59 mg/dL. Magnetic resonance imaging of the spine showed cervical degenerative changes with reactive marrow. He was prescribed intravenous vancomycin and cefepime. Blood and cerebrospinal fluid cultures were negative. Continue intravenous antibiotics Obtain additional imaging with computed tomography. Start gabapentin Start high-dose ibuprofen Crowned dens syndrome B. Obtain additional imaging with computed tomography. The key to the correct diagnosis is the presence on a CT scan of synovial crown- or halo-like calcific densities of the atlantoaxial joint, surrounding the odontoid process, in a patient with history of peripheral acute calcium pyrophosphate crystal arthritis.

This patient had crowned dens syndrome, ie, deposition of CPP or, less frequently, basic calcium phosphate crystals in the atlantoaxial joint, causing symptoms and signs of cervical spine inflammation. Continuation of antibiotics was not indicated, since CSF and MRI findings were not consistent with infection. Gabapentin is effective against neuropathic but not acute inflammatory pain. Like other forms of crystal deposition disease, CDS can be treated with corticosteroids or colchicine when there is a relative contraindication to use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as renal transplant in this patient. CDS was first described in 19801 and is defined as otherwise unexplained neck pain in the presence of radiographic atlantoaxial calcifications. Fever, headache, meningismus, and elevated levels of inflammatory markers are common. 2–6. The prevalence of CDS is not clearly established.

In 1 US series of 513 consecutive CT scans obtained for acute trauma, 7 the prevalence of atlantoaxial calcific depositions was 12. 9% overall and was 34% after age 60 years. In 2 other recent reports, 12. 5%8 to 36%9 of patients with atlantoaxial calcifications had neck pain. CDS is most commonly associated with osteoarthritis but can also be observed in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and metabolic disorders such as hyperparathyroidism or hemochromatosis, which are linked to acute CPP crystal arthritis. 3, 6, 9, 10 Synovial fluid analysis from a peripheral joint aspirate can show CPP crystals, with negative or weakly positive birefringence under polarized light microscopy. The absence of crystals does not rule out CPP crystal disease, since the sensitivity of microscopic examination for CPP crystal detection ranges from 12% to 83%.

### Tuberculous meningitis: more questions, still too few answers [^113FiaMp]. The Lancet: Neurology (2013). Medium credibility.

Tuberculous meningitis is especially common in young children and people with untreated HIV infection, and it kills or disables roughly half of everyone affected. Childhood disease can be prevented by vaccination and by giving prophylactic isoniazid to children exposed to infectious adults, although improvements in worldwide tuberculosis control would lead to more effective prevention. Diagnosis is difficult because clinical features are non-specific and laboratory tests are insensitive, and treatment delay is the strongest risk factor for death. Large doses of rifampicin and fluoroquinolones might improve outcome, and the beneficial effect of adjunctive corticosteroids on survival might be augmented by aspirin and could be predicted by screening for a polymorphism in LTA4H, which encodes an enzyme involved in eicosanoid synthesis. However, these advances are insufficient in the face of drug-resistant tuberculosis and HIV co-infection. Many questions remain about the best approaches to prevent, diagnose, and treat tuberculous meningitis, and there are still too few answers.

Antitubercular chemotherapy

General considerations

Current antitubercular chemotherapy for TBM remains based on that used in pulmonary tuberculosis and does not account for distinct disease characteristics in TBM that require specific therapeutic considerations. Use of the present regimen for TBM is not based on bespoke trials, rather on progress made in the derivation of 'short course' regimens for pulmonary tuberculosis. In contrast with pulmonary tuberculosis, where overall mortality is relatively low and the treatment goal is long-term relapse-free cure, TBM therapy must reduce early mortality and longer-term neurological disability. A primary consideration for TBM treatment is to select effective antitubercular drugs that rapidly achieve therapeutic concentrations at the site of disease. Drug penetration into brain tissue is key: CSF drug concentrations are often used but are an indirect and suboptimal measure of brain tissue penetration. There is limited pharmacometric evidence to support the composition, doses, or duration of the current standard of care for TBM. Other characteristics of an ideal TBM regimen include activity against drug-resistant M. tuberculosis strains, particularly isoniazid-resistant M. tuberculosis, which is common but infrequently detected in TBM; a low propensity for serious adverse reactions that may lead to premature discontinuation; and comprising drugs that can be dosed in neurocritical illness and that are accessible in high burden settings.

Selection of new antitubercular drugs and regimens

Ongoing and recently completed unpublished trials are shown in Table 1. All actively recruiting phase 3 trials of antitubercular therapy are investigating high-dose rifampicin (35 mg/kg), often in combination with linezolid; several are powered to demonstrate reductions in mortality. Higher dose isoniazid is also being evaluated. Doses and composition of these experimental regimens were selected based on pharmacokinetic (PK)/pharmacodynamic (PD) data from patients with pulmonary tuberculosis (using sputum culture conversion as the efficacy measure) and small trials in TBM showing inconsistent effects on clinical outcome. Nevertheless, these ongoing studies will provide high-quality evidence to inform treatment guidelines. Future trials should avoid repeating evaluation of these regimens (which may become standard of care and serve as a control in future trials, if successful) and take different approaches to regimen selection.

### Adjunctive dexamethasone for tuberculous meningitis in HIV-positive adults [^117YFbNT]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2023). Excellent credibility.

Background

Adjunctive corticosteroids are widely used to treat HIV-associated tuberculous meningitis despite limited data supporting their safety and efficacy.

Methods

We conducted a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial in HIV-positive adults (≥ 18 years) with tuberculous meningitis in Vietnam and Indonesia. Participants were randomized to a 6–8 week tapering course of either dexamethasone or placebo in addition to 12 months antituberculosis chemotherapy. The primary endpoint was death from any cause over 12 months from randomization.

Results

520 adults were randomly assigned to receive either dexamethasone (n = 263) or placebo (n = 257). The median age was 36 years, 255/520 (49.0%) had never received anti-retroviral therapy, and 251/484 (51.9%) had a baseline CD4 count of ≤ 50 cells/mm 3. Five participants were lost to follow up and 6 withdrew. Over 12 months of follow-up there were 116/263 (44.1%) deaths in the dexamethasone arm and 126/257 (49.0%) deaths in the placebo arm (hazard ratio 0.85, 95% confidence interval 0.66–1.10; P = 0.22). Pre-specified analysis did not reveal a sub-group that clearly benefited from dexamethasone. Secondary outcomes occurred with similar frequency across both treatment arms, including the incidence of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome. The numbers of participants with at least one serious adverse event were similar between dexamethasone (192/263 [73.0%]) and placebo (194/257 [75.5%]) arms (P = 0.52).

Conclusions

We did not establish a benefit of adjunctive dexamethasone in HIV-positive adults with tuberculous meningitis, either on survival or any other secondary endpoint. (Funded by the Wellcome Trust; ClinicalTrials.gov registration NCT03092817.)

### Advancing the chemotherapy of tuberculous meningitis: a consensus view [^112nfD6s]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Conclusions and future directions

Only adequately powered, definitive trials with clinical endpoints that are relevant to patients and their carers can address the unacceptable outcomes in TBM. This goal requires a recognition from funders that it is not reasonable to neglect the most serious form of tuberculosis on the grounds that it does not contribute to transmission and thus global elimination targets. To do so marginalises already vulnerable populations in which this disease is common and misses opportunity to improve overall treatment of tuberculosis, with enormous potential benefits to individuals and communities. EndTB targets – 90% reduction in deaths by 2030 - can only be achieved if the most severe forms of TB are tackled. Efficient and pragmatic clinical trials, presented in this personal view, would evaluate several readily implementable interventions for communities most affected by TBM in a cost-effective manner. This represents an opportunity for funders to make investments with direct and lasting benefit for many people in LMIC. Risk could be mitigated through seamless phase 2/3 evaluation of novel therapies and with innovative funding models that involve multiple stakeholders, including drug manufacturers. The Tuberculous Meningitis International Research Consortium will continue working towards improving treatment for people with TBM through high quality clinical trials.

Similarly to optimal dose, optimal duration of treatment with aspirin in TBM is poorly understood, demonstrated here by the differing treatment duration in the three RCTs (1 month, 60 days, 3 months). Mortality in TBM occurs predominantly in the two weeks after diagnosishowever neuroinflammatory sequelae that lead to morbidity can develop beyond this time. In a recent study of patients with TBM, acute infarcts were predominantly observed on baseline scans (26/60,43%) with only 1/33 undergoing follow-up imaging demonstrating new evidence of infarction 60 days later. Here, 89% of patients showed worsening MRI findings despite treatment including 82% (27/33) with new or enlarged tuberculomas and 76% (25/33) with worsening meningeal enhancement. The discussion around optimal duration therefore must consider the mechanism for which aspirin is used, which in turn reverts to discussion on optimal dose and mechanisms of action; optimal duration may differ depending on whether low (anti-platelet) or high (anti-inflammatory) doses are being used, and whether use is to prevent stroke, or whether there is potential to prevent other neuroinflammatory sequalae.

Consideration of means to assess outcome is also required; the authors concluded that aspirin may have a role in stroke prevention, which was a secondary outcome in this meta-analysis, however there were substantial differences in the type and timing of brain imaging conducted by each study. Pre- and post-contrast MRI is the modality of choice in TBM, but access to this is limited, particularly in settings where TBM is common. CT imaging is limited in its ability to detect new infarcts in particular those that are acute, small (e.g. lacunar), or located in the posterior fossa, which must be considered within the analyses. The finding that radiological changes occurred in the absence of clinical deterioration in the aforementioned study, also supports the need for pre-specified imaging timepoints despite clinical course.

This meta-analysis provides welcome stimulus for discussion on the potential benefit of aspirin in TBM, however also highlights the lack of consensus on its use. Results from RCT underway (NCT03927313, NCT04145258) will shed light on this, in particular optimal dosing, and may in turn increase what is currently a weak armoury of host directed therapies for patients with TBM.

Therapeutic goals

Effectively control Mycobacterium tuberculosis

TBM became a treatable disease in the 1940s with the discovery of the first antitubercular drugs, streptomycin and para-aminosalicylic acid. The bacterial killing induced by these two drugs reduced mortality from 100% to around 70%. However, whilst bacterial killing is necessary for survival from TBM, the correlation between increased bacterial killing and better clinical outcomes has been elusive. This may be due to the difficulties of measuring killing with relatively few bacteria in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and the confounding influence of inflammation upon outcome. Clinical studies of TBM caused by isoniazid-resistant bacteria showed that resistance was associated with reduced times to CSF sterility, which in turn was associated with worse outcomes, especially in PWH. However, clinical trials of 'optimised' antitubercular regimens that result in greater brain drug exposures have had mixed results. A trial of higher dose rifampicin (13 mg/kg given intravenously) confirmed higher drug exposure and documented increased survival, but a much larger trial did not show any benefit of adding higher dose rifampicin (15 mg/kg orally) and levofloxacin to standard therapy unless disease was caused by isoniazid-resistant bacteria. Nevertheless, despite equivocal findings of previous studies, improved brain penetration and thus faster bacterial killing may lead to better outcomes. This motivates testing new and potentially more active antitubercular drugs for TBM, and mandates associated pharmacometric studies that will enable better understanding of the complex relationship between drug exposure, bacterial killing, and clinical outcome.

Control host inflammation

Excessive host inflammation contributes to death and disability from TBM. Whilst limited evidence exists to guide adjunctive therapies, a landmark trial in Vietnam demonstrated that 6–8 weeks adjunctive dexamethasone reduced 9-month mortality in a predominantly HIV-negative group of adults and adolescents with TBM, though with no impact on disability. However, current doses of corticosteroids may be insufficient to prevent and reduce host inflammation in all TBM patients, particularly in PWHand in the context of high dose rifampicin which increases corticosteroid clearance. The recently published ACT-HIV trial (dexamethasone for TBM in PWH) from Vietnam and Indonesia did not conclusively establish a benefit of dexamethasone on survival in PWH. In paediatric TBM, corticosteroids have also shown clinical benefit. However, more targeted approaches to reducing tissue damaging host responses are emerging as understanding of TBM immunopathology deepens.

### Tuberculous meningitis: progress and remaining questions [^116buve4]. The Lancet: Neurology (2022). High credibility.

Tuberculous meningitis is a devastating brain infection that is caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis and is notoriously difficult to diagnose and treat. New technologies characterising the transcriptome, proteome, and metabolome have identified new molecules and pathways associated with tuberculous meningitis severity and poor outcomes that could offer novel diagnostic and therapeutic targets. The next-generation GeneXpert MTB/RIF Ultra assay, when used on CSF, offers diagnostic sensitivity for tuberculous meningitis of approximately 70%, although it is not widely available and a negative result cannot rule out tuberculous meningitis. Small trials indicate that clinical outcomes might be improved with increased doses of rifampicin, the addition of linezolid or fluoroquinolones to standard antituberculosis therapy, or treatment with adjunctive aspirin combined with corticosteroids. Large phase 3 clinical trials are underway worldwide to address these and other questions concerning the optimal management of tuberculous meningitis; these studies also form a platform for studying pathogenesis and identifying novel diagnostic and treatment strategies, by allowing the implementation of new genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic technologies in nested substudies.

### Efficacy and safety of aspirin as an adjunctive therapy in tubercular meningitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112pc8e8]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Tubercular meningitis (TBM) is associated with high mortality and stroke with chronic neurological sequelae even with best of care and antitubercular therapy. Studies have shown that aspirin as an adjunctive therapy might play some role in management of TBM. This systematic review and meta-analysis has been planned to evaluate the efficacy and safety of aspirin as an adjunctive therapy in TBM patients.

Methods

We conducted a systematic search of randomized controlled trials in patients with tubercular meningitis published till October 2019 in all major clinical journals. Study was registered with PROSPERO with registration number: CRD42019136689. Articles were tested for eligibility and assessed for quality and various bias. Data synthesis and analysis was done using Review manager 5.3. The primary end point for assessment of efficacy was mortality at three months. The secondary end point was stroke or composite outcome of stroke and mortality at three months. Adverse effects were also assessed as secondary safety end point.

Findings

Overall, three eligible randomized controlled trials with 365 participants were included that provided quantitative data for this meta-analysis. The analysis of primary and secondary end points was done using fixed effect model. There was not significant reduction in mortality [hazard ratio 0.78 (95% CI 0.45–1.35, p = 0.37)] and composite outcome of mortality and new onset stroke [hazard ratio 0.86 (95% CI 0.60–1.24, p = 0.43)] in aspirin group as compared to placebo. However, aspirin as compared to placebo significantly reduced new onset stroke [hazard ratio of 0.51 (95% CI 0.29–0.87, p = 0.01)].

Interpretation

We did not find significant reduction in mortality and composite outcome (mortality and new onset stroke) with aspirin as compared to placebo but there was significant reduction in new onset stroke in aspirin group as compared to placebo with Number Needed to Treat (NNT) = 10, which might be of clinical importance since stroke is responsible for high mortality and morbidity in these subset of patients. However, a large well conducted randomized controlled trial is required to put more light on the available evidence.

### Adjunctive dexamethasone for tuberculous meningitis in HIV-positive adults [^112Nc8Ks]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2023). Excellent credibility.

A strength of our trial is that it studies adjunctive corticosteroids exclusively in HIV-positive adults with tuberculous meningitis, increasing the available data from this important population by more than five times. The trial was pragmatic, enrolling all those with suspected tuberculous meningitis requiring anti-tuberculosis drugs and therefore generating findings of real-world relevance, where a high proportion of patients are treated for tuberculous meningitis without bacteriological confirmation. Lastly, the trial had high retention with only 5 participants lost to follow-up.

Given the high mortality of HIV-associated tuberculous meningitis, and the frequency of inflammatory intracerebral complications, there is an ongoing need to explore alternative antiinflammatory strategies. These might include more targeted immunosuppression – against tumor necrosis factor α or interleukin-1, for example – which may be superior to corticosteroids for the prevention or treatment of inflammatory complications. Case reports and small case series have demonstrated a potential role for infliximab, thalidomide, and anakinra, in some tuberculous meningitis patients. Evaluation of these agents in clinical trials is required.

In summary, we did not establish a benefit of adjunctive dexamethasone in HIV-positive adults with tuberculous meningitis on survival or any other secondary outcome over 12 months. The mortality associated with tuberculous meningitis in HIV-positive individuals remains unacceptably high, emphasising the global importance of enhanced detection and early treatment of HIV and tuberculosis.

### Six months therapy for tuberculous meningitis [^115sNys6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

We summarized the results of the assessment for the group of cohorts that received six months ATT and the group of cohorts that received prolonged ATT regimens, in 'Risk of bias' graphs and tables, with supporting evidence from the study reports (and the ' Characteristics of included studies ' tables).

Measures of treatment effect

We stated in our protocol, Jullien 2016, that we would calculate the risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous outcomes and the rate ratio for count data outcomes, and that we would present the effect estimates with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). This was not possible, as we did not find any trials that directly compared short versus prolonged course regimens. Therefore, we presented the findings separately for each group of cohorts.

Dealing with missing data

Where data from the study reports were insufficient, unclear, or missing, we attempted to contact the study authors for additional information. For all included studies, we performed a complete‐case analysis, which means that we only analysed the available data.

Assessment of heterogeneity

We assessed clinical and methodological diversities by looking at the variability in participants, interventions, and risk of bias of the included cohorts.

Assessment of reporting biases

We planned to construct funnel plots to assess publication bias, but this was not possible as no comparative trials met the inclusion criteria of this review.

Data synthesis

Although we planned to conduct meta‐analyses, this was not possible. Instead we synthesized results narratively and in tables. We attempted to assess the quality of the evidence using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) principles (Guyatt 2011), but this was not possible due to the lack of direct comparison between short‐ and prolonged‐course regimens. Instead, we constructed a modified 'Summary of findings' table to summarize findings of both groups of cohorts, and assessed the quality of the evidence narratively. We used Review Manager (RevMan 2014) to gather and synthesise our findings.

Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity

We could not conduct formal subgroup analyses. Instead we explored heterogeneity between trials narratively by considering differences between study populations and intervention, such as: age group of participants, clinical severity of the disease at presentation, HIV status, time of the study, and length of follow‐up.

Sensitivity analysis

We did not perform a sensitivity analysis as we were unable to conduct meta‐analyses.

### Adjunctive dexamethasone for tuberculous meningitis in HIV-positive adults [^1178ZiAu]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2023). Excellent credibility.

Randomization and study groups

Randomization to dexamethasone or placebo was 1:1, with stratification by participating site and modified Medical Research Council (MRC) tuberculous meningitis severity grade. Participants in grade I had a Glasgow Coma Score of 15 (possible range, 3 to 15, with higher scores indicating better status) with no focal neurologic signs; grade II participants had a score of either 11 to 14, or 15 with focal neurological signs; and grade III participants had a score of 10 or less. The randomization list was computer-generated based on random permuted blocks with block size 4 and 6 (probability 0.75 and 0.25). Randomization of participants was performed by trained clinical staff using a web-based software, with 24-hour availability.

Study treatments

All participants received standard-of-care anti-tuberculosis chemotherapy and antiretroviral therapy (ART) according to national guidelines (Supplementary Text S2). In ART-naive participants, ART was started approximately 6–8 weeks after starting anti-tuberculosis chemotherapy. All participants were randomized to dexamethasone or placebo, termed 'study drug', following the regimen previously shown to reduce tuberculous meningitis mortality (Supplementary Text S3). Blinded study drug packages (fully made-up and labelled treatment packs) contained either dexamethasone or identical placebo. All participants and investigators were blinded to study drug allocation. Participants with grade II or III disease received intravenous treatment for four weeks (0.4 mg per kilogram per day for week 1, 0.3 mg per kilogram per day for week 2, 0.2 mg per kilogram per day for week 3, and 0.1 mg per kilogram per day for week 4) and then oral treatment for four weeks, starting at 4 mg per day and decreasing by 1 mg each week. Participants with grade I disease received three weeks of intravenous therapy (0.3 mg per kilogram per day for week 1, 0.2 mg per kilogram per day for week 2, and 0.1 mg per kilogram per day for week 3) and then oral treatment for three weeks, starting at 3 mg per day and decreasing by 1 mg each week. Adherence to study medication was ensured with the use of supervised drug intake for inpatients, encouraged by detailed instructions at discharge, and medication compliance checks at follow-up visits or phone calls.

### Tuberculous meningitis: where to from here? [^1119H4Ng]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

TBM is difficult to diagnose, optimal drug regimens are unknown, and management of common complications poorly evidence-based. The true global burden of TBM is hard to ascertain, and many cases likely remain undiagnosed. Standardization of research methods and of study reporting, facilitated by global networking through the TBM International Research Consortium, first convened in 2009, represents progress. The consortium has also recently published a collection of reviews and opinion pieces on TBM. Recent and new clinical trials are encouraging, however, there is still a long way to go to convert an increasing evidence base into improved clinical outcomes. Few studies exist in paediatric TBM, despite the high burden of disease in this population. Studies of complications causing critical illness of TBM are particularly lacking. Research priorities include developing a high-sensitivity diagnostic test with the ability to exclude TBM. In addition, evidence to support shortened intensified anti-TB chemotherapy regimens would be welcome. Unfortunately, the current prognosis of TBM, particularly of severe cases, remains poor, and mortality and morbidity from this disease unacceptably high.

### Six months therapy for tuberculous meningitis [^112VD7Rq]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Tuberculous meningitis (TBM) is the main form of tuberculosis that affects the central nervous system and is associated with high rates of death and disability. Most international guidelines recommend longer antituberculous treatment (ATT) regimens for TBM than for pulmonary tuberculosis disease to prevent relapse. However, longer regimens are associated with poor adherence, which could contribute to increased relapse, development of drug resistance, and increased costs to patients and healthcare systems.

Objectives

To compare the effects of short-course (six months) regimens versus prolonged-course regimens for people with tuberculous meningitis (TBM).

Search Methods

We searched the following databases up to 31 March 2016: the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), published in the Cochrane Library; MEDLINE; EMBASE; LILACS; INDMED; and the South Asian Database of Controlled Clinical Trials. We searched the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov for ongoing trials. We also checked article reference lists and contacted researchers in the field.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and prospective cohort studies of adults and children with TBM treated with antituberculous regimens that included rifampicin for six months or longer than six months. The primary outcome was relapse, and included studies required a minimum of six months follow-up after completion of treatment.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors (SJ and HR) independently assessed the literature search results for eligibility, and performed data extraction and 'Risk of bias' assessments of the included studies. We contacted study authors for additional information when necessary. Most data came from single arm cohort studies without a direct comparison so we pooled the findings for each group of cohorts and presented them separately using a complete-case analysis. We assessed the quality of the evidence narratively, as using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was inappropriate with no direct comparisons between short- and prolonged-course regimens.

Main Results

Four RCTs and 12 prospective cohort studies met our inclusion criteria, and included a total of 1881 participants with TBM. None of the included RCTs directly compared six months versus longer regimens, so we analysed all data as individual cohorts to obtain relapse rates in each set of cohorts. We included seven cohorts of participants treated for six months, with a total of 458 participants. Three studies were conducted in Thailand, two in South Africa, and one each in Ecuador and Papua New Guinea between the 1980s and 2009. We included 12 cohorts of participants treated for longer than six months (ranging from eight to 16 months), with a total of 1423 participants. Four studies were conducted in India, three in Thailand and one each in China, South Africa, Romania, Turkey and Vietnam, between the late 1970s and 2011. The proportion of participants classified as having stage III disease (severe) was higher in the cohorts treated for six months (33.2% versus 16.9%), but the proportion with known concurrent HIV was higher in the cohorts treated for longer (0/458 versus 122/1423). Although there were variations in the treatment regimens, most cohorts received isoniazid, rifampicin, and pyrazinamide during the intensive phase. Investigators achieved follow-up beyond 18 months after completing treatment in three out of the seven cohorts treated for six months, and five out of the 12 cohorts treated for eight to 16 months. All studies had potential sources of bias in their estimation of the relapse rate, and comparisons between the cohorts could be confounded. Relapse was an uncommon event across both groups of cohorts (3/369 (0.8%) with six months treatment versus 7/915 (0.8%) with longer), with only one death attributed to relapse in each group. Overall, the proportion of participants who died was higher in the cohorts treated for longer than six months (447/1423 (31.4%) versus 58/458 (12.7%)). However, most deaths occurred during the first six months in both treatment cohorts, which suggested that the difference in death rate was not directly related to duration of ATT but was due to confounding. Clinical cure was higher in the group of cohorts treated for six months (408/458 (89.1%) versus longer than six months (984/1336 (73.7%)), consistent with the observations for deaths. Few participants defaulted from treatment with six months treatment (4/370 (1.1%)) versus longer treatment (8/355 (2.3%)), and adherence was not well reported.

Authors' Conclusions

In all cohorts most deaths occurred in the first six months; and relapse was uncommon in all participants irrespective of the regimen. Further inferences are probably inappropriate given this is observational data and confounding is likely. These data are almost all from participants who are HIV-negative, and thus the inferences will not apply to the efficacy and safety of the six months regimens in HIV-positive people. Well-designed RCTs, or large prospective cohort studies, comparing six months with longer treatment regimens with long follow-up periods established at initiation of ATT are needed to resolve the uncertainty regarding the safety and efficacy of six months regimens for TBM.

### Advances in the diagnosis and treatment of tuberculous meningitis [^111BWgxv]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Early diagnosis and treatment of tuberculous meningitis (TBM) saves lives, but current laboratory diagnostic tests lack sensitivity and the best treatment regimens are uncertain. This article reviews the advances towards better TBM diagnosis and treatments made over the last 2 years.

Recent Findings

A modified Ziehl-Neelsen stain, interferon-gamma release assays and Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigen detection assays have all shown promise as new TBM diagnostic tests. HIV-associated TBM carries an especially grave prognosis and there are new data describing the optimal timing of antiretroviral treatment initiation and the clinical predictors of TBM immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome. The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of different fluoroquinolones for TBM treatment have been compared, and there are intriguing new data to suggest higher doses of rifampicin given intravenously may improve the survival. Finally, there are preliminary data to suggest that the beneficial effect of adjunctive corticosteroids on TBM survival may be augmented by aspirin and predicted by a polymorphism in a gene responsible for eicosanoid synthesis.

Summary

Much remains to be done to improve the outcome from TBM. There have been important advances in the treatment, which may influence treatment guidelines in the near future, but there remains an urgent need for better diagnostic tests.

Tuberculosis (TB) meningitis — corticosteroids: a meta-analysis including 1337 adult and pediatric patients reported that at 3–18-month follow-up, corticosteroid use reduced mortality by almost 25% without changing overall neurological outcomes; results were consistent with an RCT of moderate quality, though other trials showed no benefit, treatment durations ranged from 1 to 8 weeks with no definitive duration, the overall quality of evidence was moderate, and overall there is some suggestion that corticosteroids may reduce mortality with durations likely much longer than with community-acquired meningitis.

### Six months therapy for tuberculous meningitis [^113qkCNr]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Quality of the evidence

We derived the results from single‐arm studies and not direct randomized comparisons, although some were arms within randomized controlled trials (RCTs) performed for other purposes. As such, participant characteristics, comorbidities, the severity of the disease, differences in ATT regimens, drug resistance, drug‐related adverse events, quality of supportive care, and method of follow‐up could be different between the two groups, and making causal inferences on the basis of potentially confounded cohorts is problematic. Because of this substantial clinical and methodological heterogeneity between the studies, we did not attempt to perform a meta‐analysis or perform a Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) assessment. Nevertheless, relapse rates were low after treatment completion in both groups.

Potential biases in the review process

We attempted to limit bias by following the rigorous methods provided by the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2011). The Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Information Specialist performed the literature search without language restrictions, and as such it is unlikely that we missed any large studies. We attempted to identify unpublished studies by contacting relevant researchers in this area, but only one study author replied. Thus, we cannot rule out the possibility that we missed some unpublished data. Also, we were unable to assess publication bias because no study directly compares six versus longer than six months of ATT. We attempted to limit bias in the selection process, data extraction, and assessment of the quality of the included studies by conducting these processes independently and by comparing results between at least two review authors.

Agreements and disagreements with other studies or reviews

The findings of this Cochrane Review are similar to those of a systematic review conducted by van Loenhout‐Rooyackers 2001, who concluded, based on the results of 11 included studies, that six months regimens with at least isoniazid, rifampicin, and pyrazinamide were sufficient for participants with fully drug sensitive TBM. This review was similar to our review in that the included studies were all non‐randomized observational studies. Completion of treatment was 81% in participants that received six months regimens and 85% in those that received longer regimens. There were 2/131 and 0/591 participants with relapse in the six months regimen group and longer ATT group respectively. Another systematic review, which belongs to a series that addressed the scientific evidence behind the World Health Organization (WHO)'s recommendations, reviewed the most appropriate ATT for TBM and drew similar conclusions regarding length of treatment, based on four prospective and retrospective observational cohorts (Woodfield 2008).

### Advancing the chemotherapy of tuberculous meningitis: a consensus view [^112XkqfJ]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Evaluating therapies in a global trial

Key study populations

TBM affects all age groups but is especially common amongst young children and in PWH. Therefore, therapeutic trials, particularly phase 3 trials, should include these patient groups. It is also essential that all disease severities are included in future trials. Some previous trials of corticosteroids excluded those with mild disease (MRC grade 1), believing inflammation, and therefore likely benefit, was less in these patients. However, the 2004 Vietnam trial showed that whilst dexamethasone benefited all three MRC severity grades, and sustained benefit beyond 2 years was only seen in those with grade 1 disease. Conversely, there is risk of systematic exclusion of patients with more severe disease without capacity to provide informed consent themselves, and ethics committees should support mechanisms for obtaining surrogate consent to provide the sickest patients an opportunity for trial participation.

The limited sensitivity of current diagnostic tests for TBM means ascertaining the true population with TBM is difficult. In 2010, the TBM consortium published a uniform case definition for TBM that is now widely used to categorise TBM research participants into definite, probable, possible, and not TBM. This case classification is applied retrospectively after all diagnostic information has returned thus is not practical for eligibility at enrolment. Enrolling cases of suspected TBM, based on clinician intention to treat for TBM, is the most pragmatic approach for phase 3 trials and reflects real-world clinical practice. However, this may result in enrolment of cases eventually re-classified with a different diagnosis. Cases of possible TBM who are treated for TBM are heterogenous across different settings, with approaches to commencing antitubercular chemotherapy particularly influenced by the HIV and tuberculosis prevalence in that population. Therefore, increased sample sizes might be required recognising that a small proportion might not have TBM and therefore may respond differently to new interventions.

### Treatment outcomes of tuberculous meningitis in adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114234J9]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Tuberculosis remains a major global health problem. Treatment outcomes for adult tuberculous meningitis are very poor, especially for patients diagnosed in stage III or HIV co-infection. The early diagnosis of tuberculous meningitis is hampered by the low sensitivity of cerebrospinal fluid microscopy and the slow growth of MTB in conventional culture systems. Rapid, sensitive and specific molecular detection methods should be widely used in the diagnosis of tuberculous meningitis. Effective anti-tuberculosis and adjunctive corticosteroid therapy is crucial for the treatment outcome of tuberculous meningitis.

### The use of adjunctive corticosteroids in the treatment of pericardial, pleural and meningeal tuberculosis: do they improve outcome? [^112kFx7a]. Respiratory Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Tuberculosis remains a major cause of mortality and morbidity on a global scale. Effective anti-tuberculous chemotherapy has improved outcomes for individuals suffering from tuberculosis, although the disease often results in significant and permanent damage to organs. The use of adjunctive corticosteroid treatment has been studied with a view to demonstrating a reduction in inflammatory events that may improve outcomes for both mortality and morbidity. Cochrane reviews have summarized the evidence for adjunctive corticosteroids in the treatment of tuberculous pericarditis, meningitis and pleural effusion. These reviews have shown improved mortality for pericarditis and meningitis, but inconclusive effects for pericardial constriction and ongoing neurological disability. Rapid improvements in clinical parameters for pleural effusion were not supported by any lasting improved outcomes for these patients.

### Adjunctive dexamethasone for tuberculous meningitis in HIV-positive adults [^116SMnr1]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2023). Excellent credibility.

Tuberculous meningitis is a serious complication caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. It is especially common in HIV-positive individuals, in whom mortality can exceed 50% despite effective anti-tuberculosis chemotherapy. –

Death and neurological sequelae from tuberculous meningitis are associated with intracerebral inflammation. Attempts to improve outcomes by controlling inflammation with adjunctive corticosteroids were first reported in 1952. In 2004, a trial in 545 Vietnamese adolescents and adults showed that adjunctive dexamethasone reduced mortality from tuberculous meningitis, although the benefit was uncertain in the 98 HIV-positive people enrolled into the trial.

The number of HIV-positive adults with tuberculous meningitis ever enrolled into trials of adjunctive corticosteroids remains at 98. A systematic review and meta-analysis of corticosteroids for tuberculous meningitis concluded that their benefit in HIV-positive individuals was uncertain. However, many treatment guidelines recommend corticosteroids for everyone with tuberculous meningitis, regardless of HIV status. – Trials of adjunctive corticosteroids for HIV-positive individuals with other forms of tuberculosis and other opportunistic infections highlight the potential risks of this approach. Corticosteroids have been associated with an increased risk of HIV-associated malignancies, especially Kaposi sarcoma, and in HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis adjunctive dexamethasone was associated with increased death, disability, and adverse events.

Adjunctive corticosteroids are widely used for the treatment of HIV-associated tuberculous meningitis, but with little evidence for their safety or efficacy. We therefore conducted a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial to determine if adjunctive dexamethasone reduced mortality in HIV-positive adults with tuberculous meningitis.

### Six months therapy for tuberculous meningitis [^116TxQKW]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

We considered the outcomes for this Cochrane Review carefully. Although treatment failure is an important outcome in TBM, there is currently no accepted definition of TBM treatment failure. In this review, we defined treatment failure as referring to participants who failed to improve with ATT, or deteriorated following initial improvement while on ATT. Importantly, this definition excluded participants who deteriorate after completing ATT; we classified these participants as relapses for the purposes of this review. In our preliminary work for the TB‐INDEX guidelines, we included treatment failure as a secondary outcome (INDEX‐TB 2016; Jullien 2015). During this work, it became apparent that this outcome was not directly related to the duration of treatment, as by definition it can occur at any point during ATT. Furthermore, treatment failure was not well defined or described in many of the included studies, was not reported consistently, and participants were described as having treatment failure usually received longer treatment. Thus, we decided not to include treatment failure as a primary or secondary outcome in this review, although we did provide the information in the 'Results' section for completeness.

For our inclusion criteria, we also considered length of follow‐up carefully. Long follow‐up periods are required to reliably detect all cases of relapse. Therefore, we excluded studies with short follow‐up to limit detection bias, as this could lead to underestimation of the number of relapses, which was the primary outcome of this review.

Adverse events

All adverse effects related to the ATT.

The clinical signs and symptoms occurring at presentation may predict prognosis, and early diagnosis may also decrease the number of adverse outcomes. Attia and associates conducted a Medline search to review the role of clinical examination in the diagnosis of acute meningitis. Studies were included if they involved patients whose meningitis was confirmed by lumbar puncture or autopsy findings. Community-acquired meningitis is more likely to occur in patients with diabetes mellitus, otitis media, pneumonia, sinusitis or alcohol abuse. Many of the signs and symptoms of meningitis are nonspecific, such as fever, myalgia and rash. The inflammatory response of the meninges leads to some of the more protective responses, such as clinically detectable neck stiffness, or Kernig and Brudzinski signs. As the inflammation progresses, it can also cause headache, vomiting and changes in mental status. Fewer than two thirds of patients present with the classic triad of neck stiffness, fever and altered mental status. On examination, the patient may have a fever or rash, and may spontaneously assume a position known as the Amoss or Hoyne sign, in which the knees and hips are flexed, the neck is extended and the back is arched. Kernig and Brudzinski signs are also described as typical findings on examination. The Kernig sign is positive if pain in the lower back or posterior thigh occurs when the knee is extended while the patient is lying in the supine position and the hip is flexed at a right angle. The Brudzinski sign is positive if knee and hip flexion occurs when the neck is flexed while the patient is in the supine position. Another commonly performed maneuver is jolt accentuation of the headache, which is positive when the headache worsens as the patient turns his or her head horizontally at two to three rotations per second.

The rightsholder did not grant rights to reproduce this item in electronic media. For the missing item, see the original print version of this publication. The authors found that single symptoms had a low sensitivity for diagnosing acute meningitis. The sensitivity of neck pain was 28 percent; nonpulsatile headache, 15 percent; generalized headache, 50 percent; and nausea and vomiting, 60 percent. Therefore, clinical history alone was not useful in diagnosing acute meningitis. However, some elements of the physical examination were useful in establishing the diagnosis. Almost all patients had at least two of the three symptoms, and some studies found that even more patients presented with at least one symptom. If a patient presents without fever, neck stiffness or altered mental status, it is highly unlikely that he or she has acute meningitis. The sensitivity of fever as a single sign was 85 percent, and the specificity was 45 percent.

However, it should be noted that septic patients may actually be hypothermic, so the absence of fever lowers the likelihood of acute meningitis but does not eliminate it entirely. Neck stiffness was found to have a sensitivity of 70 percent; Brudzinski sign had a 97 percent sensitivity and the Kernig sign had a sensitivity of 57 percent. Normal mental status, in patients at low risk for meningitis, may rule out this condition. There have been few studies on the specificity of these signs but, in general, the specificity is low. The authors conclude that meningitis may be ruled out if a patient does not have fever, neck stiffness or changes in mental status. Fever is the most sensitive sign, followed by neck stiffness. Kernig and Brudzinski signs, although poorly tested, seem to be specific for the diagnosis of meningitis. The authors do not believe that either sign is sensitive enough to be used for making the diagnosis of meningitis.

### Drug insight: steroids in CNS infectious diseases – new indications for an old therapy [^116AzJgx]. Nature Clinical Practice: Neurology (2008). Medium credibility.

Infectious diseases of the CNS lead to overwhelming inflammatory processes within the brain and spinal cord that contribute substantially to patient morbidity and mortality. Pharmacological strategies to modulate inflammation have been investigated, although the resulting guidelines have sometimes been contradictory. Steroids have been proposed as adjunctive treatments for bacterial meningitis, tuberculous meningitis and herpes simplex virus encephalitis. Well-designed randomized controlled trials have established dexamethasone as an adjunctive therapy for adult patients receiving antibiotics for bacterial meningitis, and physicians prescribing the initial antibiotics need to be aware of current guidelines. Morbidity and mortality in patients with tuberculous meningitis exceeds 50%. Steroid treatments reduce mortality through an as yet unknown mechanism, although their effects on morbidity are less clear. Herpes simplex virus encephalitis is also associated with considerable morbidity and mortality. Despite a lack of randomized trials, there is some evidence that steroids used alongside antiviral therapy might be beneficial in this condition. As we discuss in this Review, systemic steroid treatment is an important aspect of treatment regimens for CNS infectious diseases, and the recent literature provides guidelines for the use of steroids in combination with appropriate antimicrobial therapy.

### Advancing the chemotherapy of tuberculous meningitis: a consensus view [^116QWLdF]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2025). High credibility.

General considerations

Interventions with anti-inflammatory effects are required to reduce immunopathology and consequent mortality and disability. There is rationale to investigate targeted therapies, directed at inflammatory molecules or pathways central to TBM pathophysiology that may complement or replace corticosteroids. The heterogeneity of inflammatory response between individuals suggest certain subgroups may derive more benefit from HDT than others. Examples include TBM in PWH, which is associated dysregulated inflammation, high mortality, and unclear benefit from corticosteroids; and patients developing paradoxical worsening during treatment who often require intensification of corticosteroid therapy. Identification of specific clinical phenotypes (for example, severity and nature of inflammation at baseline estimated by clinical, radiological or CSF markers) or genotypes (for example, variations in leukotriene A4 hydrolase (LTA4H) associated with distinct inflammatory phenotypes) that predict individual risk and treatment response is a priority. Mechanistic investigations nested in interventional trials can provide important insights. The LAST-ACT trial, which provides corticosteroids based on LTA4H genotype, is an example of targeted anti-inflammatory approach developed from translational studies in TBM. However, until such time as other treatment-defining subgroups emerge, the priority is to evaluate an intervention that offers potential benefit to all patients, with possibility to identify subgroups for targeted intervention at a later stage.

Tuberculosis meningitis — corticosteroids: We recommend use of corticosteroids to reduce mortality in patients with tuberculosis meningitis (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). We cannot make a recommendation for one specific corticosteroid or dose in patients with TB meningitis due to the inconsistency of agents and doses evaluated in the literature, and we suggest that treatment with corticosteroids should be continued for two or more weeks in patients with tuberculosis meningitis (conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence).

HIV/TB coinfection — TB meningitis and management on antiretroviral therapy (ART): Adjunctive corticosteroid therapy is recommended for all people with HIV and TB meningitis (AII) and precludes the need for pre-emptive use of prednisone to prevent IRIS. When tuberculosis (TB) occurs in people already on ART, treatment for TB must be started immediately (AIII), and ART should be modified to reduce the risk of drug interactions and to maintain virologic suppression. When TB occurs in the setting of virologic failure, antiretroviral (ARV) drug-resistance testing should be performed, and intensified adherence counseling should be provided, and a new ARV regimen may be required to achieve virologic suppression and minimize drug interactions with the anti-TB regimen.

### Six months therapy for tuberculous meningitis [^114kM2Dn]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

A study that reviewed treatment duration for people with TBM by comparing case series of adults and children, showed similar completion and relapse rates between six months regimens including at least isoniazid, rifampicin, and pyrazinamide and longer regimens (van Loenhout‐Rooyackers 2001). In this review, we have included more recent studies, and performed 'Risk of bias' assessments and appraised the quality of the evidence.

This review was prompted as part of work with the Central TB Division, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare in India, and the All India Institute of Medical Sciences in New Delhi in preparation for the Indian Extra‐Pulmonary TB (INDEX‐TB) guidelines (INDEX‐TB 2016). There was uncertainty and debate as to whether six to nine months of treatment is as safe as longer regimens for treating people with TBM (Jullien 2015), with varying views on what the literature showed. As we knew there were no randomized controlled trials (RCTs), we sought to summarize and critically appraise evidence from observational studies. The initial systematic review found several observational studies that reported low numbers of relapse with short regimens, but did not include all the available evidence for longer regimens. In this Cochrane Review, we examined the effects of six months (short‐course) and longer than six months (prolonged‐course) regimens on TBM outcomes.

### Corticosteroids for managing tuberculous meningitis [^117BWuJf]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Why it is important to do this review

Several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have been conducted on the effect of corticosteroids in managing people with tuberculous meningitis. The conclusions from these trials, seen individually, appear inconsistent. One trial, Thwaites 2004, showed that dexamethasone increases survival rate. However, it also raised two questions: do people who survive because of dexamethasone therapy tend to be left with severe disability, and are there differential effects among subgroups of people with different degrees of disease severity? The editorial that accompanied the trial, Quagliarello 2004, and several letters to the editor in response to this trial (Marras 2005; Seligman 2005) commented that the trial did not have sufficient statistical power to answer these questions. We have prepared a meta‐analysis that synthesizes the results from all available RCTs to try and provide the necessary power to address these questions.

### Advancing the chemotherapy of tuberculous meningitis: a consensus view [^113WGN16]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Statistical considerations

A large trial is needed to demonstrate superiority of new antitubercular and anti-inflammatory regimens over standard of care. Assuming typical mortality, a trial of 900 patients per arm would be required to detect a 20% reduction in mortality with 90% power. Making no presumption of interaction between antitubercular and anti-inflammatory drugs, an efficient design is factorial randomization across two domains:

Domain 1: Antitubercular therapy. The trial would ideally investigate at least three regimens, with one of them being a standard-of-care regimen (following WHO recommendations). For practical reasons (rifampicin stains secretions red) this randomisation would likely be open label, but outcome assessors would be blinded.

Domain 2: HDT. The priority intervention is infliximab versus standard of care (corticosteroids). Infliximab would be combined with corticosteroids in the experimental groups. This randomisation could be blinded with a placebo saline infusion. As the efficacy of HDT regimens may differ between people with and without HIV, a basket trial design could be adopted with partial pooling across the two groups.

Human immunodeficiency virus and tuberculosis coinfection — antiretroviral therapy timing — indicates that for those with a CD4 count ≥ 50 cells/μL (Recommendation 6) this is a strong recommendation with high certainty in the evidence, and an important exception is tuberculous meningitis in whom ART should not be initiated in the first 8 weeks of antituberculosis therapy.

### Poor prognosis of HIV-associated tuberculous meningitis regardless of the timing of antiretroviral therapy [^112KT4ZA]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Although causes of death were not defined, the overriding risk factor for death was the TB meningitis severity grade, which suggests that deaths may well have been largely attributable to TB meningitis rather than to other HIV-associated co-pathologies. It was also notable that 85 (58.2%) of the 146 deaths occurred within the first month of observation, which further suggests that many of the patients had such advanced disease at study entry that they simply could not be salvaged. Use of dexamethasone is an important adjunctive therapy in HIV-uninfected patients with TB meningitis in this setting and has been shown, in a randomized controlled trial, to improve survival by ∼30%. However, no conclusive benefit was demonstrated among patients with HIV-associated TB meningitis in the same study, which was conducted in the pre-ART era. No trials involving corticosteroids have been performed among patients receiving ART, because the use of corticosteroids is now regarded as standard of care.

The high proportion of patients with advanced TB meningitis severity grades was a key factor in the overall mortality and may have been related to the prolonged symptom duration (median duration of symptoms, 21 days; interquartile range, 10–30 days) prior to study entry. Because the Hospital for Tropical Diseases in Ho Chi Minh City is a tertiary referral hospital that serves a population of 38 million people in southern Vietnam, referral delays from peripheral hospitals may be prolonged, and delays may be further compounded by the difficulties inherent in the diagnosis of TB meningitis. The prolonged interval between symptom onset and initiation of TB treatment is likely to have contributed to poor outcomes and must be reduced.

Four patients had multidrug-resistant TB meningitis, which is strongly predictive of death; no second-line therapy was available for these patients. Drug resistance profiles of other isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis were not reported, but > 40% of isolates from similar patients previously treated in this setting had isoniazid mono-resistance. Although a previous study in this setting found that isoniazid mono-resistance was associated with slower mycobacterial clearance from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) during treatment, this was not associated with adverse clinical outcomes. However, in a study from the United States of a cohort of 1614 patients with positive CSF culture results, initial isoniazid resistance was associated with an adjusted odds of death of 2.1 (95% confidence interval, 1.30–3.29). This strongly suggests that the issue of isoniazid monoresistance and outcomes of treatment for TB meningitis warrants further study.

### Intensified antituberculosis therapy in adults with tuberculous meningitis [^116v1Eaj]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2016). Excellent credibility.

Background

Tuberculous meningitis is often lethal. Early antituberculosis treatment and adjunctive treatment with glucocorticoids improve survival, but nearly one third of patients with the condition still die. We hypothesized that intensified antituberculosis treatment would enhance the killing of intracerebral Mycobacterium tuberculosis organisms and decrease the rate of death among patients.

Methods

We performed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial involving human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected adults and HIV-uninfected adults with a clinical diagnosis of tuberculous meningitis who were admitted to one of two Vietnamese hospitals. We compared a standard, 9-month antituberculosis regimen (which included 10 mg of rifampin per kilogram of body weight per day) with an intensified regimen that included higher-dose rifampin (15 mg per kilogram per day) and levofloxacin (20 mg per kilogram per day) for the first 8 weeks of treatment. The primary outcome was death by 9 months after randomization.

Results

A total of 817 patients (349 of whom were HIV-infected) were enrolled; 409 were randomly assigned to receive the standard regimen, and 408 were assigned to receive intensified treatment. During the 9 months of follow-up, 113 patients in the intensified-treatment group and 114 patients in the standard-treatment group died (hazard ratio, 0.94; 95% confidence interval, 0.73 to 1.22; P = 0.66). There was no evidence of a significant differential effect of intensified treatment in the overall population or in any of the subgroups, with the possible exception of patients infected with isoniazid-resistant M. tuberculosis. There were also no significant differences in secondary outcomes between the treatment groups. The overall number of adverse events leading to treatment interruption did not differ significantly between the treatment groups (64 events in the standard-treatment group and 95 events in the intensified-treatment group, P = 0.08).

Conclusions

Intensified antituberculosis treatment was not associated with a higher rate of survival among patients with tuberculous meningitis than standard treatment. (Funded by the Wellcome Trust and the Li Ka Shing Foundation; Current Controlled Trials number, ISRCTN61649292.).

### Six months therapy for tuberculous meningitis [^111yw4Zg]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

In addition, we extracted data on treatment failure (number of participants in each treatment group who failed to improve with ATT, or deteriorated following initial improvement while on ATT), on neurological sequelae (number of participants in each treatment group with neurological sequelae as described by the original study authors), and on follow‐up (length of follow‐up after completing ATT, the way participants were followed‐up, and number and characteristics of losses to follow‐up).

For each established outcome, we extracted the number of participants assigned and the numbers analysed in each treatment group. For dichotomous outcomes, we extracted the number of participants experiencing the event. For count data outcomes, we extracted the number of events in the intervention and control group. From our preliminary work, we knew that relapse and default are relatively uncommon. Therefore we did not attempt a time‐to‐event analysis for these outcomes as the results are likely to be misleading.

For the purposes of analysis in this review, we categorized treatment groups to six months or more than six months based on the duration of treatment they were scheduled to receive.

Assessment of risk of bias in included studies

Based on our preliminary work, we anticipated there would be no studies with a direct comparison between short and prolonged ATT. We treated the included studies as observational cohort studies for the purpose of analysis in our review. The Cochrane 'Risk of bias' assessment tool, Higgins 2011, and the Downs and Black checklist for assessment of methodological quality, Downs 1998, are inadequate to assess the quality of single‐arm observational cohort studies. Therefore, we devised a 'Risk of bias' assessment tool to appraise the reliability of the outcome data from each study, based on the domains included in the 'Risk Of Bias In Non‐randomized Studies ‐ of Interventions' (ROBINS‐I) tool (Sterne 2016), which applies to non‐randomized, observational cohort studies. As no direct comparison is made between cohorts treated with six and more than six months of ATT, we did not assess participant selection and allocation. At least two review authors independently assessed each included study for potential sources of bias that could have affected the reliability of the outcome data, and resolved any discrepancy through discussion. We classified our judgments as either low, high, or unclear risk of bias based on the following criteria.

### Corticosteroids for managing tuberculous meningitis [^1165LpW8]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Tuberculous meningitis, a serious form of tuberculosis that affects the meninges covering the brain and spinal cord, is associated with high mortality and disability among survivors. Corticosteroids have been used as an adjunct to antituberculous drugs to improve the outcome, but their role is controversial.

Objectives

To evaluate the effects of corticosteroids as an adjunct to antituberculous treatment on death and severe disability in people with tuberculous meningitis.

Search Strategy

In September 2007, we searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2007, Issue 3), MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, and Current Controlled Trials. We also contacted researchers and organizations working in the field, and checked reference lists.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials comparing a corticosteroid plus antituberculous treatment with antituberculous treatment alone in people with clinically diagnosed tuberculosis meningitis and which include death and/or disability as outcome measures.

Data Collection and Analysis

We independently assessed search results and methodological quality, and independently extracted data. We analysed the data using relative risks (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and the fixed-effect model. We also conducted complete-case and best-worst case analyses.

Main Results

Seven trials involving 1140 participants (with 411 deaths) met the inclusion criteria. All used dexamethasone or prednisolone. Overall, corticosteroids reduced the risk of death (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.91; 1140 participants, 7 trials). Data on disabling residual neurological deficit from three trials showed that corticosteroids reduce the risk of death or disabling residual neurological deficit (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.70 to 0.97; 720 participants, 3 trials). Adverse events included gastrointestinal bleeding, bacterial and fungal infections and hyperglycaemia, but they were mild and treatable.

Authors' Conclusions

Corticosteroids should be routinely used in HIV-negative people with tuberculous meningitis to reduce death and disabling residual neurological deficit amongst survivors. However, there is not enough evidence to support or refute a similar conclusion for those who are HIV positive.

### Dexamethasone for the treatment of tuberculous meningitis in adolescents and adults [^114juAYE]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2004). Excellent credibility.

Background

Tuberculous meningitis kills or disables more than half of those affected with the disease. Previous studies have been too small to determine whether adjunctive treatment with corticosteroids can reduce the risk of disability or death among adults with tuberculous meningitis, and the effect of coinfection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is unclear.

Methods

We performed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in Vietnam in patients over 14 years of age who had tuberculous meningitis, with or without HIV infection, to determine whether adjunctive treatment with dexamethasone reduced the risk of death or severe disability after nine months of follow-up. We conducted prespecified subgroup analyses and intention-to-treat analyses.

Results

A total of 545 patients were randomly assigned to groups that received either dexamethasone (274 patients) or placebo (271 patients). Only 10 patients (1.8 percent) had been lost to follow-up at nine months of treatment. Treatment with dexamethasone was associated with a reduced risk of death (relative risk, 0.69; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.52 to 0.92; P = 0.01). It was not associated with a significant reduction in the proportion of severely disabled patients (34 of 187 patients [18.2 percent] among survivors in the dexamethasone group vs. 22 of 159 patients [13.8 percent] in the placebo group, P = 0.27) or in the proportion of patients who had either died or were severely disabled after nine months (odds ratio, 0.81; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.58 to 1.13; P = 0.22). The treatment effect was consistent across subgroups that were defined by disease-severity grade (stratified relative risk of death, 0.68; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.52 to 0.91; P = 0.007) and by HIV status (stratified relative risk of death, 0.78; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.59 to 1.04; P = 0.08). Significantly fewer serious adverse events occurred in the dexamethasone group than in the placebo group (26 of 274 patients vs. 45 of 271 patients, P = 0.02).

Conclusions

Adjunctive treatment with dexamethasone improves survival in patients over 14 years of age with tuberculous meningitis but probably does not prevent severe disability.

### WITHDRAWN: steroids for treating tuberculous meningitis [^115DdMiX]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Even though corticosteroids have been used alongside antituberculosis drugs for tuberculous meningitis (TBM) since the 1950s their role remains controversial. Some believe corticosteroids improve outcome while others point to the lack of supportive evidence. In patients who are immunocompromised because of HIV infection the risks and benefits of steroids are unknown.

Objectives

To assess the effects of steroids on death and disability in patients with TBM.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group specialized trials register (February 2005), The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library Issue 1, 2005), MEDLINE (1966 to February 2005), EMBASE (1980 to February 2005), and LILACS (February 2005).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of steroids in people on TB treatment for TBM.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two independent reviewers applied study selection criteria, assessed methodological quality and extracted data.

Main Results

Six trials of 595 patients met the inclusion criteria. No study described allocation concealment. Steroids were associated with fewer deaths (relative risk [RR] 0.79; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.65 to 0.97) and a reduced incidence of death and severe residual disability (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.88). Subgroup analysis suggests an effect on mortality in children (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.96) but the results in a smaller number of adults are inconclusive (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.84). There is little evidence that the severity of disease influences the effects of steroids on mortality.

Authors' Conclusions

Adjunctive steroids might be of benefit in patients with TBM. However, existing studies are small, and poor allocation concealment and publication bias may account for the positive results found in this review. No data are available on the use of steroids in HIV positive persons. Future placebo-controlled studies should include patients with HIV infection and should be large enough to assess both mortality and disability.

### Official American Thoracic Society / centers for disease control and prevention / Infectious Diseases Society of America clinical practice guidelines: treatment of drug-susceptible tuberculosis [^115Ld1Gy]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Tuberculous meningitis — antimycobacterial regimen and monitoring: Initial therapy uses isoniazid (INH), rifampin (RIF), pyrazinamide (PZA), and ethambutol (EMB) in an initial 2-month phase; after 2 months, if strains are susceptible, discontinue PZA and EMB and continue INH and RIF for an additional 7–10 months. Expert opinion supports repeated lumbar punctures early in therapy to monitor cerebrospinal fluid parameters. In children, the AAP lists INH, RIF, PZA, and ethionamide or an aminosalicylic acid for 2 months (in place of EMB), followed by 7–10 months of INH and RIF. There are no controlled data to guide the fourth drug selection; most societies and experts recommend either an injectable or EMB, and for adults the writing committee prefers EMB as the fourth drug.

### British infection society guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of tuberculosis of the central nervous system in adults and children [^1118s6Ep]. The Journal of Infection (2009). Low credibility.

SUMMARY AND KEY RECOMMENDATIONS: The aim of these guidelines is to describe a practical but evidence-based approach to the diagnosis and treatment of central nervous system tuberculosis in children and adults. We have presented guidance on tuberculous meningitis (TBM), intra-cerebral tuberculoma without meningitis, and tuberculosis affecting the spinal cord. Our key recommendations are as follows: 1. TBM is a medical emergency. Treatment delay is strongly associated with death and empirical anti-tuberculosis therapy should be started promptly in all patients in whom the diagnosis of TBM is suspected. Do not wait for microbiological or molecular diagnostic confirmation. 2. The diagnosis of TBM is best made with lumbar puncture and examination of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Suspect TBM if there is a CSF leucocytosis (predominantly lymphocytes), the CSF protein is raised, and the CSF:plasma glucose is < 50%. The diagnostic yield of CSF microscopy and culture for Mycobacterium tuberculosis increases with the volume of CSF submitted; repeat the lumbar puncture if the diagnosis remains uncertain. 3. Imaging is essential for the diagnosis of cerebral tuberculoma and tuberculosis involving the spinal cord, although the radiological appearances do not confirm the diagnosis. A tissue diagnosis (by histopathology and mycobacterial culture) should be attempted whenever possible, either by biopsy of the lesion itself, or through diagnostic sampling from extra-neural sites of disease e.g. lung, gastric fluid, lymph nodes, liver, bone marrow. 4. Treatment for all forms of CNS tuberculosis should consist of 4 drugs (isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, ethambutol) for 2 months followed by 2 drugs (isoniazid, rifampicin) for at least 10 months. Adjunctive corticosteroids (either dexamethasone or prednisolone) should be given to all patients with TBM, regardless of disease severity. 5. Children with CNS tuberculosis should ideally be managed by a paediatrician with familiarity and expertise in paediatric tuberculosis or otherwise with input from a paediatric infectious diseases unit. The Children's HIV Association of UK and Ireland (CHIVA) provide further guidance on the management of HIV-infected children (www.chiva.org.uk). 6. All patients with suspected or proven tuberculosis should be offered testing for HIV infection. The principles of CNS tuberculosis diagnosis and treatment are the same for HIV infected and uninfected individuals, although HIV infection broadens the differential diagnosis and anti-retroviral treatment complicates management. Tuberculosis in HIV infected patients should be managed either within specialist units by physicians with expertise in both HIV and tuberculosis, or in a combined approach between HIV and tuberculosis experts. The co-administration of anti-retroviral and anti-tuberculosis drugs should follow guidance issued by the British HIV association (www.bhiva.org).

### Corticosteroids for managing tuberculous meningitis [^111mcZo8]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Quality of the evidence

We used the GRADE approach to assess the quality of the evidence for the two primary outcomes at two to 24 months follow‐up, and at five years follow‐up (Table 1).

We graded the quality of the estimate of effect for the outcome death at two to 24 months follow‐up as high. We assessed the estimate of effect as being at low risk of bias, as while there are some included trials that did not clearly report on the randomization method or allocation concealment, or both, the two largest included trials had few concerns and showed a consistent effect. The trials provided evidence of benefit for all age groups. Although only one trial reported on outcomes for people living with HIV, there was no obvious qualitative heterogeneity. We did not find any serious imprecision. We graded the estimate of effect for death at five years follow‐up as moderate, and downgraded by one for indirectness as the data came from a single trial conducted in a high quality healthcare unit in a setting with high levels of endemic infectious diseases and poverty.

We assessed the quality of the estimate of effect for the outcome disabling neurological deficit as low quality. The lack of blinding of outcome assessors of disabling neurological deficit in four of the eight trials reporting this outcome led us to downgrade the quality of evidence by one for risk of bias. There was imprecision of this estimate relating to the small number of events, which led us to downgrade by one. We graded the estimate of effect for disabling neurological deficit at five years follow‐up as very low quality, and downgraded by one for indirectness as the data was from a single trial (as for the outcome death, see above) and by two for imprecision as there were few events and the CI ranged from substantive harms to substantive benefits of corticosteroids.

Potential biases in the review process

We have attempted to limit bias in the review process. The Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Information Specialist conducted the literature search, and it is unlikely that these searches missed any major trials; however, we cannot rule out the possibility that we missed some small unpublished trials. The funnel plot did not assist with this because there were too few included trials. To limit bias in the trial selection process and data extraction, we independently examined the search results, determined study selection, and extracted data.

### Corticosteroids for managing tuberculous meningitis [^116mG3EZ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Assessment of risk of bias in included studies

We independently assessed methodological quality using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool and reported the results in a 'Risk of bias' table (Higgins 2011). Regarding generation of allocation sequence and allocation concealment, we classified each of these as either adequate, inadequate, or unclear according to Jüni 2001. We reported who was blinded in each trial, and assessed the risk of bias associated with blinding separately for the two primary outcomes. If at least 90% of participants were followed up to the trial's completion we classified inclusion of all randomized participants as adequate; otherwise we classified inclusion as inadequate. We attempted to contact the trial authors if this information was not specified or if it was unclear. We resolved any disagreements by discussion between the review authors.

Measures of treatment effect

We used relative risk as the measure of treatment effect for analysis.

Unit of analysis issues

There were no cluster RCTs.

Dealing with missing data

The primary analysis is an intention‐to‐treat analysis where all participants randomized to treatment are included in the denominator. This analysis assumes that all losses to follow‐up have good outcomes. We carried out a sensitivity analysis to explore the impact of the missing data on the summary effect estimate for death.

Assessment of heterogeneity

We assessed heterogeneity by visually inspecting the forest plots to determine closeness of point estimates with each other and overlap of confidence intervals (CIs). We used the Chi² test with a P value of 0.10 to indicate statistical significance, and the I² statistic to assess heterogeneity with a value of 50% taken to indicate statistical heterogeneity. We planned to investigate heterogeneity through the following subgroup analyses: drug resistance (susceptible versus resistant M. tuberculosis); severity of illness (MRC stages I, II, and III); and HIV status (seropositive versus seronegative).

Assessment of reporting biases

We conducted visual inspection of the funnel plot of the trials for any obvious asymmetry that could be evidence of publication bias.

### Tuberculous meningitis in patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus [^113KGecF]. Journal of Neurology (2011). Low credibility.

Tuberculosis is the most common opportunistic infection in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected persons. HIV-infected patients have a high incidence of tuberculous meningitis as well. The exact incidence and prevalence of tuberculous meningitis in HIV-infected patients are not known. HIV infection does not significantly alter the clinical manifestations, laboratory, radiographic findings, or the response to therapy. Still, some differences have been noted. For example, the histopathological examination of exudates in HIV-infected patients shows fewer lymphocytes, epithelioid cells, and Langhan's type of giant cells. Larger numbers of acid-fast bacilli may be seen in the cerebral parenchyma and meninges. The chest radiograph is abnormal in up to 46% of patients with tuberculous meningitis. Tuberculous meningitis is likely to present with cerebral infarcts and mass lesions. Cryptococcal meningitis is important in differential diagnosis. The recommended duration of treatment in HIV-infected patients is 9–12 months. The benefit of adjunctive corticosteroids is uncertain. Antiretroviral therapy and antituberculosis treatment should be initiated at the same time, regardless of CD4 cell counts. Tuberculous meningitis may be a manifestation of paradoxical tuberculosis-associated immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome. Some studies have demonstrated a significant impact of HIV co-infection on mortality from tuberculous meningitis. HIV-infected patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculous meningitis have significantly higher mortality. The best way to prevent HIV-associated tuberculous meningitis is to diagnose and isolate infectious cases of tuberculosis promptly and administer appropriate treatment.

### Timing of initiation of antiretroviral therapy in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) – associated tuberculous meningitis [^111RmzLY]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Background

The optimal time to initiate antiretroviral therapy (ART) in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated tuberculous meningitis is unknown.

Methods

We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of immediate versus deferred ART in patients with HIV-associated tuberculous meningitis to determine whether immediate ART reduced the risk of death. Antiretroviral drugs (zidovudine, lamivudine, and efavirenz) were started either at study entry or 2 months after randomization. All patients were treated with standard antituberculosis treatment, adjunctive dexamethasone, and prophylactic co-trimoxazole and were followed up for 12 months. We conducted intention-to-treat, per-protocol, and prespecified subgroup analyses.

Results

A total of 253 patients were randomized, 127 in the immediate ART group and 126 in the deferred ART group; 76 and 70 patients died within 9 months in the immediate and deferred ART groups, respectively. Immediate ART was not significantly associated with 9-month mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 1.12; 95% confidence interval [CI].81–1.55; P = 0.50) or the time to new AIDS events or death (HR, 1.16; 95% CI, .87–1.55; P = 0.31). The percentage of patients with severe (grade 3 or 4) adverse events was high in both arms (90% in the immediate ART group and 89% in the deferred ART group; P = 0.84), but there were significantly more grade 4 adverse events in the immediate ART arm (102 in the immediate ART group vs 87 in the deferred ART group; P = 0.04).

Conclusions

Immediate ART initiation does not improve outcome in patients presenting with HIV-associated tuberculous meningitis. There were significantly more grade 4 adverse events in the immediate ART arm, supporting delayed initiation of ART in HIV-associated tuberculous meningitis. Clinical Trials Registration.

### Adjunctive thalidomide therapy for childhood tuberculous meningitis: results of a randomized study [^114g6dbE]. Journal of Child Neurology (2004). Low credibility.

Childhood tuberculous meningitis is associated with serious long-term sequelae, including mental retardation, behavior disturbances, and motor handicap. Brain damage in tuberculous meningitis results from a cytokine-mediated inflammatory response, which causes vasculitis and obstructive hydrocephalus. Thalidomide, a potent tumor necrosis factor alpha inhibitor, was well tolerated and possibly showed some clinical benefit in children with tuberculous meningitis during a pilot study. The purpose of the present study was to assess the effect of adjunctive thalidomide in addition to standard antituberculosis and corticosteroid therapy on the outcome of tuberculous meningitis. Thalidomide (24 mg/kg/day orally) or placebo was administered in a double-blind randomized fashion for 1 month to patients with stage 2 or 3 tuberculous meningitis. The study was terminated early because all adverse events and deaths occurred in one arm of the study (thalidomide group). Thirty of the 47 children enrolled received adjunctive thalidomide, of whom 6 (20%) developed a skin rash, 8 (26%) hepatitis, and 2 (6%) neutropenia or thrombocytopenia. Four deaths (13%) occurred in patients with very severe neurologic compromise at baseline; two deaths were associated with a rash. Motor outcome after 6 months of antituberculosis therapy was similar in the two groups, even though the thalidomide group showed greater neurologic compromise on admission. In addition, the mean IQ of the two treatment groups did not differ significantly (mean IQ thalidomide group 57.8 versus mean IQ control group 67.5; P = 0.16). These results do not support the use of adjunctive high-dose thalidomide therapy in the treatment of tuberculous meningitis.

### Advancing the chemotherapy of tuberculous meningitis: a consensus view [^117TRnVC]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Given the inability to perform frequent direct brain sampling in patients with TBM and the limitations of using CSF as a proxy for site of disease drug exposure, pre-clinical disease models are a promising strategy to optimise and select new drugs to enter TBM trials. A translational TBM model should recapitulate key elements of human disease, including similar time course and clinical manifestations, typical histopathology, and compatible bacterial load and distribution. Importantly, TBM models should employ dosing schedules that are used in patients. These features enable better predictive ability and may serve as potential efficacy markers. Animal models enable estimation of drug penetration within any CNS compartment at human-equivalent doses (determined by approximating plasma drug exposures from patients), which can be extrapolated to inform regimen design for trials. The underlying hypothesis is that rapid attainment of maximal effect exposures for a potent antitubercular agent at the site of disease in a relevant TBM model may translate into clinical efficacy. A major limitation of TBM models (and clinical trials) is lack of a predictive PD marker for treatment response. Application of efficacy measures from pulmonary tuberculosis, such as decline in bacterial load, do not necessarily predict clinical treatment response in TBM. This may lead to incorrect conclusions around clinical effectiveness of new drugs, with a risk of down-selecting potentially good candidates or promoting drugs that may not perform well in patients. Other limitations of preclinical models in TBM include altered oral bioavailability of combination regimens due to intolerance of high drug volumes during administration and differences in drug metabolism across species limiting evaluation of PK variability and drug-drug interactions.

### Six months therapy for tuberculous meningitis [^115z4MDX]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Description of the condition

Tuberculosis (TB) is caused by infection with one of several mycobacterial species that belong to the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex. TB is estimated to be the leading infectious cause of death worldwide alongside HIV, and approximately one‐third of the world's population is thought to have latent TB. TB is associated with poverty. Low‐ and middle‐income countries carry the greatest burden of the disease, and more than three‐quarters of cases are reported in South‐East Asia, the Western Pacific, and Africa (WHO 2015). Tuberculous meningitis (TBM) is a severe form of TB, which affects the meninges that cover the brain and spine. TBM is the main form of TB that affects the central nervous system (CNS), which accounts for approximately 1% of all cases of active TB, and 5% to 10% of extrapulmonary TB cases (TB involving organs other than the lungs) (Thwaites 2009; Török 2015). TBM prevalence is higher in populations with high overall TB prevalence. The World Health Organization (WHO) reported 0.8 million new extrapulmonary TB cases worldwide in 2013 out of 5.4 million people with a first episode of TB (WHO 2014). TBM mainly affects children and immunosuppressed people (Principi 2012).

TBM is a major contributor to the death and disability associated with TB. Death occurs in around 30% of people with TBM and 50% of people who survive TBM suffer from neurological deficits that cause disability despite antituberculous treatment (ATT) (Principi 2012). Early diagnosis and prompt treatment with ATT and corticosteroids are the main determinants of outcome in TBM (Prasad 2016; Thwaites 2013).

TBM is diagnosed clinically by recognition of meningitis together with findings suggestive of M. tuberculosis infection (Principi 2012). A "bacteriologically confirmed TBM case" implies confirmation of the diagnosis by identification of M. tuberculosis in the person's cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) by microscopy, cell culture, or molecular methods. A case diagnosed as TBM by a health worker without laboratory confirmation is defined as a "clinically diagnosed TBM case" (WHO 2013). The disease severity at presentation is classified into three stages according to the British Medical Research Council (MRC) (MRC 1948), based on the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) (Teasdale 1974) and neurological signs.

### Global case fatality of bacterial meningitis during an 80-year period: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111L5MEB]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

From 2000 to 2019, when the proportion of pneumococcal meningitis increased, the overall CFR remained stable. Two important changes in prevention and management occurred during this time. First, pneumococcal conjugate vaccines were introduced in high-income countries. The introduction of the 7-valent conjugate pneumococcal vaccine in the US in 2000 led to a decrease of 90% of invasive pneumococcal disease, including meningitis, for the serotypes included in the vaccine. Although the increase in the relative proportion of pneumococcal meningitis may lead to worse outcomes for the overall CFR, the decreasing CFR within the pneumococcal subgroup was most pronounced, at least in high-income countries. The introduction of adjunctive anti-inflammatory treatment, dexamethasone, contributed to this decline. Cohort studies have shown improved outcomes of bacterial meningitis after implementation of adjunctive dexamethasone therapy in several countries. This practice gained widespread adoption following a landmark trial of dexamethasone in adults with bacterial meningitis in 2002. After its publication, a meta-analysesshowed that adjunctive treatment with corticosteroids resulted in a reduction in hearing loss and neurological sequelae. The beneficial effect of dexamethasone was particularly evident in the most severely ill patients, specifically those with pneumococcal meningitis. No beneficial effects of adjunctive corticosteroids have been identified in studies done in low-income countries. Naturally, other factors could have influenced the improved outcome, such as increased awareness of the importance of fast administration of antibiotic therapy. Several studies showed faster treatment in bacterial meningitis patients is associated with improved outcomes. The 2016 European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases guideline advises to start treatment as soon as possible but at least within 1 hour of arrival in the emergency department.

We found a consistent disparity between outcomes in higher and low-income countries. This can be explained by a lower level of access to health care with limited resources and treatment options and a higher rate of coexisting HIV infection and malnutrition. Furthermore, limitations in the availability of diagnostic tests and surveillance systems hinder the differentiation between malaria and tuberculous meningitis with bacterial meningitis, which may delay appropriate treatment and lead to underreporting. Finally, a higher bacterial resistance rate to common antimicrobial treatments and lack of effect of adjunctive dexamethasone may contribute to the identified difference in mortality rate. The impact of mortality and morbidity on a population level remains much higher for low-income countries. Our findings underscore the critical role of enhanced medical care accessibility and the development of specific treatments in driving improvements in CFRs, particularly in the most severe cases and vulnerable populations.

### Corticosteroids for managing tuberculous meningitis [^112FTbvg]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Description of the intervention

Without anti‐tuberculous treatment, people with tuberculous meningitis die (Tandon 1988; Thwaites 2002). Streptomycin, one of the earliest antituberculous drugs to be introduced, reportedly reduced the case‐fatality rate to 63% (Parsons 1988). Newer antituberculous drugs − isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol − are associated with better survival, but mortality remains comparatively high. Reports of mortality rates vary from 20% to 32%, and permanent neurological deficits in an additional 5% to 40% of people who survive tuberculous meningitis (Ramchandran 1986; Alarcón 1990; Jacobs 1990; Jacobs 1992).

Indirect evidence from animal studies provides a biological basis for how corticosteroids could be effective (Feldman 1958). They may decrease inflammation, especially in the subarachnoid space; reduce cerebral and spinal cord oedema, and intracranial pressure (Feldman 1958; Parsons 1988); and reduce inflammation of small blood vessels, and damage due to blood flow slowing to the underlying brain tissue. However, corticosteroids could also cause harm by suppressing the person's immune system. They may suppress the symptoms of TB infection but promote an unchecked growth of the bacteria and an increased bacterial load, and reduce inflammation of the meninges, which will then reduce the ability of drugs to cross the blood‐brain barrier and enter the subarachnoid space. Other adverse effects of corticosteroids include gastrointestinal haemorrhage, electrolyte imbalance, hyperglycaemia, hypertension, and increased risk of infections from other pathogens (D'Arcy‐Hart 1950).

The use of adjunctive corticosteroids is not known to result in disability in tuberculous meningitis, especially when used for short periods of time as is the case in most clinical trials of this intervention. However, there is concern that although corticosteroids may save the lives of some people who have severe tuberculous meningitis, they may not necessarily improve their quality of life, as some people may survive but be left with a severe disability, rendering them bed‐bound and highly dependent. In other words, if corticosteroids increase the survival rate but not disability‐free survival, then corticosteroids might actually increase a person's suffering.

### Six months therapy for tuberculous meningitis [^111FrMhF]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Data extraction and management

One review author (SJ) piloted the data extraction form on two studies. Based on the results of the pilot, we modified and finalized the data extraction form. Two review authors (SJ and HR) independently extracted data from the included studies according to the agreed data extraction tool. We compared the data extracted by the two review authors to identify any possible errors. We resolved any discrepancies through discussion and by referring to the original articles. We extracted the following data.

Country, when the study was conducted, study design, inclusion and exclusion criteria applied, and the number of participants recruited.
Participant characteristics: age, gender, epidemiological data such as known contact with TB patient, duration of symptoms at presentation, clinical severity of the disease according to the British Medical Research Council (MRC) scale, comorbidity (HIV, other immunosuppression disease and other diseases), and diagnostic methods used (for example, CSF testing, neuroimaging, chest X‐ray, purified protein derivative (PPD) skin test) along with number of bacteriologically confirmed and clinically‐diagnosed TBM cases.
Intervention data: description of drugs, dose, route of administration in both the intensive and continuation phase, and duration of ATT for both phases. Administration of other drugs or therapeutic procedures.
Outcome data.

For the primary outcome we extracted the following data.

Relapse: number of relapse cases, stratified by age and HIV status, if available; clinical severity of relapse; clinical severity at original diagnosis; method of diagnosing relapse; time between end of treatment and relapse.

For the secondary outcomes we extracted the following data.

Death from any cause: number of deaths, stratified by clinical severity, age, HIV status, if available.
Death after six months of ATT treatment: number of deaths after six months, stratified by clinical severity, age and HIV status if available; time from start of ATT until death; cause of death, if specified.
Clinical cure: number of cases cured at end of treatment; number of cases cured stratified by clinical severity, age, HIV status if available.
Default: number of defaulters, stratified by clinical severity, age and HIV status if available; method of monitoring adherence during treatment (clinical history, direct observation, tablet counting).
Poor adherence: number of participants not receiving prescribed ATT regimen but not meeting the definition of default; method of monitoring adherence during treatment (clinical history, direct observation, tablet counting).

### Corticosteroids for managing tuberculous meningitis [^114dTAgj]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Agreements and disagreements with other studies or reviews

Several TB guidelines recommend the use of corticosteroids as an adjunct to treatment of TB meningitis internationally (CDC 2003; BSI 2009; SNHS 2010; NICE 2011).

Questions remain about the mechanism by which corticosteroids improve clinical outcomes, and advances in understanding of these mechanisms have led to a suggestion that some people may benefit from corticosteroids while others do not, and some may even be adversely affected by steroids (Thwaites 2013). Leukotriene A4 hydrolase (LTA4H) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of mycobacterial infection through its effect on the equilibrium between pro‐ and anti‐inflammatory eicosanoids. Tobin et al. showed that both low‐ and high‐LTA4H expression zebrafish morphants show increased mycobacterial bacterial burden compared with wildtype controls (Tobin 2010; Tobin 2012). Low‐LTA4H expression led to increased lipoxin A4 production and dampening of the early tissue necrosis factor‐alpha (TNF‐α) response, and high‐LTA4H morphants showed increased macrophage lysis despite early control of intracellular mycobacterial replication by TNF‐α, with subsequent extracellular mycobacterial growth. Both of these states led to uncontrolled mycobacterial replication. Thus, hypersusceptibility to mycobacterial infection is associated with both inadequate and excessive inflammatory responses.

The use of dexamethasone in the zebrafish morphants rescued high‐LTA4H animals but led to increased susceptibility in low‐LTA4H animals (Tobin 2012). In people, the LTA4H transcription level is regulated by a polymorphism in the gene promoter at SNP rs17525495, with rs17525495 TT associated with high LTA4H protein expression, rs17525495 CC associated with low expression, and rs17525495 CT intermediate expression. Genotyping performed on 182 participants from a series of clinical studies in Vietnam demonstrated that people with the TT genotype (high LTA4H, hyperinflammatory) had the highest mortality amongst participants who did not receive dexamethasone, but the lowest in the dexamethasone group; the people with the CC genotype (low LTA4H, hypoinflammatory) had the highest mortality in the dexamethasone group (Tobin 2012). These results suggest that LTA4H genotype may have an important influence on whether or not steroids are effective in tuberculous meningitis, at least in this population.

### Official American Thoracic Society / centers for disease control and prevention / Infectious Diseases Society of America clinical practice guidelines: treatment of drug-susceptible tuberculosis [^114wbnp7]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) in HIV–tuberculosis co-infection — risk, timing, outcomes, and management are detailed: IRIS is more common with earlier antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation and CD4+ lymphocyte counts < 50 cells/μL, and in the STRIDE study its occurrence was 7.6%, with the majority (69%) mild to moderate and 31% hospitalized; the relative risk of IRIS for patients who receive ART during tuberculosis therapy is 1.88 (95% CI, 1.31–2.69), with higher rates when ART starts within 2 weeks versus 8–12 weeks. In general, development of IRIS does not worsen treatment outcomes, but ART is not initiated in the first 8 weeks of antituberculosis therapy for patients with HIV infection and tuberculosis meningitis (or other central nervous system tuberculosis), even for patients with CD4 cell counts < 50 cells/μL, because early initiation (within 2 weeks) was associated with increased adverse events and higher mortality. Management is symptomatic; for most mild cases tuberculosis and antiretroviral therapies can be continued with anti-inflammatory agents such as ibuprofen, drainage may be necessary for worsening pleural effusions or abscesses, and for more severe cases corticosteroids are effective; prednisone 1.25 mg/kg/day may be given for 2–4 weeks (50–80 mg/day) with tapering over 6–12 weeks or longer.

### Guidelines for the acute treatment of cerebral edema in neurocritical care patients [^112WLfE5]. Neurocritical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Treatment of Cerebral Edema in Patients with Bacterial Meningitis

In patients with bacterial meningitis, does the use of hypertonic sodium solutions for cerebral edema improve CE compared to mannitol?
In patients with bacterial meningitis, does the use of corticosteroid therapy improve neurological outcomes compared to placebo/control?

Recommendations

We recommend dexamethasone 10 mg intravenous every 6 h for 4 days to reduce neurological sequelae (primarily hearing loss) in patients with community-acquired bacterial meningitis (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).
We suggest dexamethasone 0.15 mg/kg intravenous every 6 h for 4 days as an alternative dose for patients with low body weight or high risk of corticosteroid adverse effects (good practice statement).
We recommend administering dexamethasone before or with the first dose of antibiotic in patients with bacterial meningitis (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).
We recommend use of corticosteroids to reduce mortality in patients with tuberculosis meningitis (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). We cannot make a recommendation for one specific corticosteroid or dose in patients with TB meningitis due to the inconsistency of agents and doses evaluated in the literature.
We suggest that treatment with corticosteroids should be continued for two or more weeks in patients with tuberculosis meningitis (conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence).

Rationale:

In making this recommendation, the panel felt that the quality of evidence was low and considerable variability exists within and across studies regarding the duration of corticosteroid treatment. Clinicians should use patient-specific response and clinical factors to optimize the duration of corticosteroid treatment in this setting.
6 There is insufficient evidence to determine whether hypertonic sodium solutions or mannitol is more effective to reduce ICP or cerebral edema in patients with community-acquired bacterial meningitis.

The panel evaluated whether the use of corticosteroids improved neurological outcome in patients with community-acquired bacterial meningitis and TB meningitis. (Table 1, Questions 9 and 10) The panel elected to focus on these two areas within the broader category of bacterial meningitis due to their acuity and worldwide prevalence. The literature describing corticosteroid use in community-acquired bacterial meningitis is broad and includes many studies that combined adult and pediatric populations, as well as mixed immunocompetent, immunocompromised, and unknown immune status patients. While various corticosteroids have been evaluated, the overwhelming majority administered dexamethasone. Specific antimicrobial use and the corticosteroid timing in relation to antibiotic dose were not always described but are noted in the applicable evidentiary table when the information was available. The overall quality of the evidence was moderate (Tables 7 and 8).

### Extrapulmonary tuberculosis: an overview [^111mVGKf]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

In the 1980s, after a steady decline during preceding decades, there was a resurgence in the rate of tuberculosis in the United States that coincided with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome epidemic. Disease patterns since have changed, with a higher incidence of disseminated and extrapulmonary disease now found. Extrapulmonary sites of infection commonly include lymph nodes, pleura, and osteoarticular areas, although any organ can be involved. The diagnosis of extrapulmonary tuberculosis can be elusive, necessitating a high index of suspicion. Physicians should obtain a thorough history focusing on risk behaviors for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and tuberculosis. Antituberculous therapy can minimize morbidity and mortality but may need to be initiated empirically. A negative smear for acid-fast bacillus, a lack of granulomas on histopathology, and failure to culture Mycobacterium tuberculosis do not exclude the diagnosis. Novel diagnostic modalities such as adenosine deaminase levels and polymerase chain reaction can be useful in certain forms of extrapulmonary tuberculosis. In general, the same regimens are used to treat pulmonary and extrapulmonary tuberculosis, and responses to antituberculous therapy are similar in patients with HIV infection and in those without. Treatment duration may need to be extended for central nervous system and skeletal tuberculosis, depending on drug resistance, and in patients who have a delayed or incomplete response. Adjunctive corticosteroids may be beneficial in patients with tuberculous meningitis, tuberculous pericarditis, or miliary tuberculosis with refractory hypoxemia.
