## Question

Which imaging modality is preferable for the cervical and thoracic spine: CT or MRI?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which imaging modality is preferable between CT and MRI for cervical and thoracic spine evaluation across trauma and non-traumatic scenarios. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context stratification: acute blunt trauma versus non-traumatic presentations. Then, I should verify adult versus pediatric considerations and how decision rules (NEXUS, Canadian C-Spine Rule) influence whether imaging is needed at all. Next, I will examine pathology-specific targets where CT or MRI has clear advantages. After that, I should integrate guideline-based sequencing into a practical algorithm, and finally, I need to consider operational constraints, contraindications, and a realistic "CT-first/MRI-second" cascade where appropriate [^113Hdkag] [^111tcxtj] [^113A66DS].

> Let me first confirm the high-level principle: modality choice is scenario-dependent, not universally superior. In adult acute blunt cervical trauma when imaging is indicated by decision rules, CT is the first-line test because it is fast, broadly available, and highly sensitive for osseous injury; MRI is added when ligamentous or cord injury is suspected, when there are neurologic deficits, or when the patient is obtunded with a negative CT, which directly informs stability and decompression planning [^113Hdkag] [^112JMR3N] [^115BgnR1] [^1169YARk].

> I should confirm the thoracic spine analogue in trauma, since practice often extrapolates from the cervical literature. Hold on, I need to check the ACR guidance for thoracic and lumbar regions; yes, CT is recommended initially in adults meeting imaging criteria, and reconstructions from chest/abdomen/pelvis CT can obviate additional radiation, while MRI is the next step when neurologic deficits are present or CT suggests neural element involvement, in line with EAST recommendations [^111tcxtj] [^114GiguK] [^116aYktR].

> Next, let me consider non-traumatic neck pain and radiculopathy because the "preferable modality" flips in this context. MRI is generally preferred when red flags exist, such as known malignancy, infection suspicion, or progressive neurologic deficits; conversely, in uncomplicated mechanical neck pain without red flags, imaging may not be indicated initially, which prevents overdiagnosis and cascades of low-yield findings [^114TU3YD] [^111HBUxT] [^116nfNz4].

> Wait, I should verify whether imaging is needed at all in some trauma patients before deciding between CT and MRI. For awake, asymptomatic adults without neck pain or tenderness, with normal neurologic exam, full painless range of motion, and no distracting injuries, AANS/CNS guidance supports clinical clearance without imaging; if imaging is needed in obtunded or unevaluable patients, high-quality CT is first-line, and routine acute flexion–extension films are not recommended given their limited utility in this setting [^1126WidE] [^114YfCwq] [^115wqsxB].

> Now, I need to check pediatric nuances because radiation risk alters the threshold for CT. In alert children with minor trauma and no concerning features, cervical imaging is often not needed; if imaging is warranted, radiography is generally preferred as an initial test, reserving CT for high suspicion or inadequate radiographs, while MRI is an attractive alternative to avoid radiation when resources and sedation logistics allow; I should also remember the markedly higher thyroid dose from c-spine CT in young children when balancing risks and benefits [^115ZLJRA] [^1168n29t] [^115qYozr] [^112kQxzv].

> I will now examine pathology-specific targets to avoid overgeneralization. For acute fractures and alignment, CT is superior due to spatial resolution and multiplanar bone reconstructions; for ligamentous disruption and posterior ligamentous complex injury, MRI directly visualizes the soft tissues, whereas CT provides only indirect signs; for spinal cord edema, hemorrhage, compression, and myelopathy, MRI is the modality of choice; for disc herniation, epidural collections, infection, and malignancy, MRI's soft tissue contrast and marrow evaluation are decisive [^111tcxtj] [^113Hdkag] [^112JMR3N] [^115Fn3YA] [^113tQQed] [^11611R83] [^114TU3YD].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions that a negative CT alone always ends the workup; but wait, I should double-check the strength of evidence. A 2025 meta-analysis suggested MRI identified missed injuries after negative CT in 17% of trauma patients with treatment changes in 4%, but the study is low-credibility and heterogeneous, so I should interpret it as supportive of selective, not routine, MRI in clinically concerning scenarios rather than a mandate for universal MRI after every negative CT; this is consistent with ACR's MRI-next guidance when clinical or imaging suspicion persists [^111PAoz5] [^111CAH1g] [^112JMR3N].

> Let me consider operational and safety constraints that influence "preferable" in real practice. CT is preferable when rapid acquisition is needed in unstable polytrauma, when whole-body imaging is underway with reconstructible data sets, or when MRI is contraindicated; MRI is preferable when soft tissue detail changes management and the patient can safely tolerate time in the scanner, with the caveat that availability, monitoring, and sedation resources can be limiting, especially after hours [^111tcxtj] [^113Hdkag].

> I should now synthesize a cervical trauma algorithm in prose and verify alignment with decision rules. If an adult trauma patient meets NEXUS or Canadian C-Spine Rule criteria for imaging, obtain CT first; add MRI when neurologic deficits are present, when CT suggests ligamentous or cord pathology, or when the patient is obtunded with a negative CT; in a neurologically intact patient with persistent pain and negative CT, prefer MRI over flexion–extension films given the latter's limited yield in the CT era; if decision rules indicate low risk, clinical clearance without imaging is appropriate [^113A66DS] [^113Hdkag] [^115BgnR1] [^112JMR3N] [^1169YARk] [^116GdWzH].

> For the thoracic spine, I should confirm the parallel pathway. In adult blunt trauma meeting imaging criteria, CT is the initial modality and can often be reconstructed from concurrent thoracoabdominal studies; if there are neurologic deficits or CT findings concerning for canal compromise or ligamentous injury, proceed to MRI in consultation with the spine service; in non-traumatic thoracic pathology, MRI is usually preferred for cord, marrow, infection, or tumor assessment [^111tcxtj] [^114GiguK] [^116aYktR].

> For pediatric patients, let me reiterate and be precise to avoid over-imaging. In alert children with minor trauma, many can be clinically cleared without imaging; when imaging is needed, start with radiographs, escalate to CT only with strong clinical suspicion or inadequate radiographs, and consider MRI to avoid radiation if soft tissue injury is suspected and the child can safely undergo the study with available resources [^115ZLJRA] [^1168n29t].

> Finally, I need to state the "preferable modality" answer plainly while acknowledging the complementary roles. CT is preferable for rapid osseous assessment in acute trauma and for treatment planning when instability is suspected, whereas MRI is preferable when ligamentous, cord, disc, infection, or malignancy is suspected, or when persistent clinical concern remains after a negative CT; integrate decision rules, patient status, pediatric radiation considerations, and institutional capabilities to choose wisely rather than default to a single modality in all cases [^111tcxtj] [^113Hdkag] [^114TU3YD] [^1126WidE] [^113A66DS].

---

CT is best for **acute trauma** [^113Hdkag] because it rapidly detects fractures and instability with high sensitivity and specificity [^1134exY7], and is the first-line test in most trauma protocols [^111tcxtj]. MRI is best for **soft tissue** — spinal cord, ligaments, discs, and infection [^112JMR3N] — and is the preferred modality for neurologic deficits [^115Fn3YA], suspected cord injury, or infection. Use CT first for acute trauma or when MRI is contraindicated; use MRI for neurologic symptoms, suspected cord/ligament injury, or infection. The two modalities are **complementary** [^1163LxTB] and should be selected based on clinical context.

## Clinical indications and guidelines

### Cervical spine imaging

In cervical spine imaging, **CT is recommended as the initial imaging modality** [^113Hdkag] for acute blunt cervical spine trauma, particularly when clinical decision rules such as NEXUS or the Canadian C-Spine Rule indicate imaging [^113A66DS]. It is also recommended for mechanically unstable spines and for treatment planning [^112nJRE5] [^114YfCwq]. MRI is recommended as the next imaging step in acute blunt trauma [^112JMR3N] when **cervical spinal cord or nerve root injury** is confirmed or suspected — regardless of CT findings [^115BgnR1] — and is indicated for suspected ligamentous, spinal cord, or nerve root injury [^113tQQed] [^112JMR3N].

---

### Thoracic spine imaging

In thoracic spine imaging, **CT is recommended as the initial modality** [^111tcxtj] for acute thoracic spine trauma, particularly to detect fractures and assess spinal stability [^111RnWzy]. MRI is recommended to evaluate **soft tissue, spinal cord, and ligamentous injuries** [^114GiguK], particularly when neurologic deficits are present or suspected [^116aYktR].

---

## Diagnostic accuracy and clinical utility

| **Clinical scenario** | **CT** | **MRI** |
|-|-|-|
| Acute trauma (fractures, instability) | High sensitivity and specificity for bony injuries [^113Hdkag] [^1134exY7] | Limited sensitivity for acute fractures [^114wne7g] |
| Soft tissue injuries (ligaments, discs, spinal cord) | Limited sensitivity [^112JMR3N] [^1163LxTB] | High sensitivity and specificity [^112JMR3N] [^113tQQed] |
| Neurologic deficits, spinal cord injury | Limited utility [^112JMR3N] | Preferred modality [^112JMR3N] [^115Fn3YA] |
| Infection, malignancy | Limited utility | Preferred modality [^114TU3YD] [^111iy4PR] |
| Rapid assessment, unstable patients | Preferred modality [^113Hdkag] [^1134exY7] | Limited utility due to longer acquisition time [^1163LxTB] |
| Radiation exposure | Significant [^112kQxzv] | None |
| Contraindications | None significant | Pacemakers, certain implants, severe claustrophobia |

---

## Practical considerations

CT offers **rapid acquisition** [^1134exY7], wide availability, and high effectiveness for acute trauma evaluation; however, it involves significant radiation exposure [^112kQxzv], which is particularly concerning in pediatric and young adult populations. MRI provides **no radiation exposure** and superior soft tissue contrast [^1163LxTB] but has longer acquisition times and contraindications, such as pacemakers, certain implants, and severe claustrophobia.

---

## Clinical scenarios and recommendations

- **Acute trauma (fractures, instability)**: CT is the preferred initial imaging modality [^111tcxtj] due to its rapid acquisition [^1134exY7] and high sensitivity for bony injuries [^113Hdkag].

- **Soft tissue injuries, neurologic deficits, spinal cord injury**: MRI is the preferred modality [^112JMR3N] due to its superior soft tissue contrast [^1163LxTB] and ability to detect ligamentous and spinal cord injuries [^115Fn3YA].

- **Infection, malignancy**: MRI is the preferred modality for evaluating suspected infection or malignancy due to its superior soft tissue contrast and ability to detect subtle lesions.

- **Pediatric patients**: MRI is preferred due to the absence of radiation exposure [^112kQxzv], although CT may be used cautiously when rapid assessment is required [^111PAoz5].

---

## Conclusion

CT and MRI are **complementary imaging modalities** [^1163LxTB] for evaluating the cervical and thoracic spine. CT is preferred for acute trauma and bony injuries [^113Hdkag]; MRI is superior for soft tissue injuries, neurologic deficits, and suspected infection or malignancy. The choice should be guided by the clinical scenario, patient condition, and specific diagnostic needs.

### Is older age an appropriate criterion alone for ordering cervical spine CT after trauma [^113ubsQa]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

The authors raise an interesting question regarding cervical spine clearance in elderly patients. At the time of writing, studies on this topic are limited to retrospective, single-institution studies. The authors contribute to this body of literature by framing it in the context of radiology resource utilization. A significant number of unnecessary scans could delay the reading of other critical imaging, and therefore, it is a worthy goal to continually reevaluate our standards of practice to optimize patient care.

The Canadian C-Spine Rule is the most commonly used clearance guideline in practice. It recommends universal imaging for patients aged 65 and older. However, there are currently no additional evidence-based guidelines or expert consensus recommendations on geriatric cervical spine clearance from professional trauma societies. As Healy et al. describe in their discussion, the Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma's practice management guidelines for the identification of cervical spine injuries following trauma do not mention age. Furthermore, the evaluation and management of geriatric trauma guidelines make no recommendations on imaging, and the cervical spine collar clearance guidelines are only for obtunded patients.

### Abusive spinal injury: Imaging and updates [^1118QseG]. Pediatric Radiology (2024). Low credibility.

The skeletal survey remains the first-line imaging modality for radiologic assessment in cases of suspected abuse. As part of the standard imaging protocol, lateral views of the cervical, thoracic, and lumbosacral spine should be obtained. Additional radiographs may be acquired as deemed necessary by a radiologist before the patient is released from the department, as is routine practice in the authors' institution. Evaluating the craniocervical junction (CCJ) can be particularly challenging by radiography due to overlapping structures, limited patient cooperation, and potentially fixed positioning from immobilization. If there is any clinical or radiographic suspicion of head or CCJ injury, a low threshold for obtaining cross-sectional imaging is recommended. At the authors' institution, CT head imaging obtained as part of a trauma protocol includes the upper cervical spine to the level of C2, aiding in imaging the CCJ and evaluating for associated injury. Sagittal soft tissue reconstructions through the CCJ are also valuable for detecting ligamentous injury, retroclival fluid, and prevertebral edema. Therefore, multiplanar reconstructions are invaluable for detecting injuries that may be very subtle on axial images.

- **Heterogeneity of practice**: Beyond the routinely performed skeletal survey and head CT in cases of suspected abuse, spine MRI utilization varies widely and is reported to range anywhere between 4.3% and 84.3% across the United States. Depending on findings from the initial survey, physical examination, time of presentation, and resource availability (e.g. sedation, MR), decisions regarding additional imaging are made.

Our primary outcomes were the performance of any cervical spine imaging within 24 hours of presentation, including cervical spine computed tomography (cervical spine CT), cervical spine magnetic resonance imaging (cervical spine MRI), and/or cervical spine radiography (cervical spine X-ray). Imaging performance data were extracted from the database using DRG International Classification of Diseases — 10th Revision — Clinical Modification codes: BR20ZZZ, BR201ZZ, BR200ZZ, and BR20YZZ for cervical spine CT; BR30ZZZ, BR30Y0Z, and BR30YZZ for cervical spine MRI; and BR00ZZZ and BR00ZZ1 for cervical spine X-ray.

- **Independent variables**: Hospital trauma level (labeled as I, II, or III/IV/other/not reported, according to either state or ACS designation) and pediatric specialty center status. Additional variables included patient age and sex, region of the country, injury severity (including Injury Severity Score [ISS] and Abbreviated Injury Severity Scale), Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), vital signs, method of injury, presence of a confounding comorbidity, and whether the presentation immediately followed an injury (initial presentation) or corresponded to an interfacility transfer.

Vital signs were dichotomized as either normal or abnormal based on the patient's age group. The method of injury was categorized according to DRG International Classification of Diseases — 10th Revision — Clinical Modification codes as either a fall, gunshot wound, other penetrating injury, motor vehicle accident (MVA), pedestrian versus motor vehicle (peds vs. MVA), cycling injury, or motorcycle accident.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® cervical pain or cervical radiculopathy: 2024 update [^111HBUxT]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2025). Low credibility.

Cervical spine pain is one of the most common reasons for seeking medical care, ranking among the top five causes of global years lost to disability. The economic burden of cervical pain is also significant. Imaging plays a central role in diagnosing cervical pain and its causes. However, different symptoms and potential causes of cervical pain require different initial imaging approaches to maximize diagnostic usefulness.

In this document, we address various cervical pain variants with detailed assessments of the strengths and weaknesses of different modalities for each specific variant. The American College of Radiology (ACR) Appropriateness Criteria® are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions, reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process supports the systematic analysis of medical literature from peer-reviewed journals. Established methodology principles, such as the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE), are adapted to evaluate the evidence.

The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In instances where peer-reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may serve as the primary evidentiary source available to formulate recommendations.

### ACR appropriateness criteria on suspected spine trauma [^115G3G7G]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2007). Low credibility.

The evaluation of patients with suspected spine trauma is controversial. This document addresses several pertinent issues: (1) which patients need imaging, (2) how much imaging is necessary, and (3) exactly what sort of imaging is to be performed. This subject is important because conservative estimates indicate that more than 1 million blunt trauma patients, who have the potential for sustaining spine injuries, are seen annually in emergency departments in the United States.

Adult patients who satisfy any of several "low-risk" criteria for cervical spine injury need no imaging. Patients who do not fall into this category should undergo thin-section computed tomographic examinations that include sagittal and coronal multiplanar reconstructed images. For those patients who cannot be examined using computed tomography, 3-view radiographic examinations of the cervical vertebrae may be performed to provide preliminary assessments of the likelihood of injury until computed tomography can be performed.

Thoracic and lumbar computed tomographic images may be obtained from data collected for thorax-abdomen-pelvis studies. Radiography is recommended for children under 14 years of age. Reconstructed computed tomographic images may be used from thorax-abdomen-pelvis studies of children, if they have been obtained.

Magnetic resonance imaging should be the primary modality for evaluating possible spinal cord injury or compression, as well as ligamentous injuries in acute cervical spine trauma. Flexion and extension radiography is best reserved for follow-up of symptomatic patients.

### Radiographic assessment [^1126WidE]. Neurosurgery (2013). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for cervical spine injury, specifically in relation to cervical imaging, the 2013 AANS/CNS guidelines recommend not obtaining cervical spine imaging in awake, asymptomatic patients who exhibit no neck pain or tenderness, have a normal neurological examination, are able to complete a functional range of motion examination, and have no injury that would detract from an accurate evaluation. In these patients, it is advised to discontinue cervical immobilization without cervical spinal imaging.

### Consensus practice guidelines on interventions for cervical spine (facet) joint pain from a multispecialty international working group [^114iadqx]. Pain Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Whereas ultrasound (US) may provide comparable accuracy and confer some advantages over fluoroscopy, several studies have revealed diminished accuracy rates for C7, which may also be more challenging to block with fluoroscopy. In one randomized study involving 50 patients, US and fluoroscopy were found to have similar accuracy rates (92–96%) and to provide comparable post-block pain relief, although the former was associated with shorter performance time and less intravascular contrast spread. It is important to recognize that even an imaging modality that permits direct visualization of neurovascular structures is not devoid of risks, with Park et al. reporting a case of permanent spinal cord injury following a C7 MBB was performed under US guidance, which reinforces the challenges at this cervical level.

- **Studies comparing imaging modalities for cervical facet injections**: Various imaging modalities have been compared for therapeutic interventions, including intra-articular (IA) steroid injections and radiofrequency ablation (RFA). The primary imaging modalities used are fluoroscopy, computed tomography (CT), and US.

In the lumbar anatomical region, recent multi-society guidelines recommend fluoroscopy as the preferred imaging modality for IA injections and lumbar medial branch RFA. The use of fluoroscopic guidance is well-established for thoracic outlet nerve (TON) through C8 medial branch RFA procedures. However, the use of CT and US guidance for cervical interventions, including IA facet injections with steroid, is still in its infancy, and cadaveric evaluation has yet to definitively establish comparative effectiveness and safety relative to the fluoroscopic approach. A prospective clinical trial comparing CT versus US-guided IA facet injections is ongoing.

### Non-neoplastic pathology at the crossroads between neck imaging and cardiothoracic imaging [^114ZHSVE]. Insights into Imaging (2019). Low credibility.

Multiple imaging modalities can be utilized to assess the thoracic inlet, including radiography, fluoroscopy, CT, MRI, and ultrasound. In general, radiography is limited in providing spatial details; however, it is an important screening tool in a trauma setting. Pneumomediastinum and subcutaneous emphysema are well detected by radiographs, as well as osseous abnormalities including conditions such as cervical osteophytes and diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH).

Fluoroscopy is the workhorse in dynamic visualization of the esophagus. It is a helpful screening tool for esophageal abnormalities such as diverticula, ulcers, stenosis, dysmotility, and cancer. CT provides extensive spatial resolution and is the "gold standard" for evaluating most vascular pathology, cancer staging, and as a quick evaluation tool in the setting of trauma. Evaluation of superficial structures such as the thyroid gland, cervical lymph nodes, and cervical vascular structures can be easily performed with ultrasound, which has the added benefit of portability and lack of radiation exposure. MRI is an advanced modality with superior soft tissue resolution, critical in the assessment of neural and lymphatic structures such as the brachial plexus and thoracic duct, which cannot be as reliably assessed with CT.

### Consensus practice guidelines on interventions for cervical spine (facet) joint pain from a multispecialty international working group [^113qdkXa]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

We recommend that fluoroscopy or, in providers with expertise, ultrasonography (US) be used for cervical medial branch blocks (MBB). US can be useful in patients for whom radiation exposure may be associated with potential harm; however, the lack of training may limit widespread adoption. This is a Grade A recommendation with a moderate level of certainty.

For intra-articular (IA) injections, we recommend the use of fluoroscopic imaging as the additional radiation exposure from CT compared with fluoroscopy precludes any theoretical benefit. This carries a Grade C recommendation with a low level of certainty.

For cervical medial branch radiofrequency ablation (RFA), we recommend that fluoroscopy be used as well, since the additional radiation exposure from CT compared to fluoroscopy precludes any theoretical benefit. While CT-fluoroscopy is associated with less radiation than CT alone, it is not widely available and adds significant upfront equipment costs and radiation exposure. This is a Grade A recommendation with a high level of certainty for the use of imaging, and a Grade B recommendation with a moderate level of certainty for the use of fluoroscopy instead of other imaging modalities.

### Multilevel non-contiguous spinal injuries: Incidence and patterns based on whole spine MRI [^114BbRux]. European Spine Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Multi-level non-contiguous spinal injuries are not uncommon, and their incidence varies from 1.6% to 77% depending on the imaging modality used. Delayed diagnosis and missed spinal injuries in non-contiguous spine fractures have been frequently described, which can result in significant pain, deformity, and neurological deficit. The efficacy of whole spine MRI in detecting asymptomatic significant vertebral fractures is not known.

Consecutive spinal injury patients treated between 2011 and 2013 were retrospectively evaluated based on clinical and radiographic records. Patients' demographics, mode of injury, presence of associated injuries, clinical symptoms, and the presence of neurological deficit were studied. Radiographs of the fractured region and whole spine MRI were evaluated for the presence of multi-level injuries.

Among 484 patients, 95 (19.62%) had multilevel injuries, including 86 (17.76%) with non-contiguous injuries. Five common patterns of non-contiguous spinal injuries were observed:

- **Pattern I**: Cervical and thoracic - 29.1%
- **Pattern II**: Thoracolumbar and lumbosacral - 22.1%
- **Pattern III**: Thoracic and thoracolumbar - 12.8%
- **Pattern IV**: Cervical and thoracolumbar - 9.1%
- **Pattern V**: Lumbosacral and associated injuries - 9.0%

The incidence of intra-regional non-contiguous injuries was 17.4%. Whole spine MRI scan detected 24 (28.6%) missed secondary injuries, of which 5 were unstable.

The incidence of multilevel non-contiguous spine injury using whole spine MRI imaging is 17.76%. Five different patterns of multilevel non-contiguous spinal injuries were identified.

### Variation in pediatric cervical spine imaging across trauma centers-a cause for concern [^1168n29t]. Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2021). Low credibility.

In conclusion, despite validated clinical decision algorithms promoting cervical spine X-ray as the preferred cervical spine imaging modality for pediatric trauma patients with suspected CSI, our study found that cervical spine CT remains the most common cervical spine imaging modality in the care of pediatric trauma patients. Level I trauma centers were significantly less likely to use CT and more likely to use X-ray for the initial evaluation of younger but not older pediatric trauma patients. Pediatric specialty trauma centers were significantly less likely to use cervical spine CT and more likely to use cervical spine X-ray for pediatric patients of any age. They were also significantly more likely to use MRI for younger patients. Compared with nonpediatric Level I centers, pediatric Level I centers were significantly less likely to use CT and more likely to use X-ray for the initial evaluation of both pediatric age groups, but no significant differences were found for cervical spine MRI use. Better dissemination of and education on appropriateness criteria for evaluation of pediatric CSI may lead to improved outcomes of pediatric spinal injury with decreased cost and radiation exposure at a population level.

### Imaging appropriateness for neck pain [^116nfNz4]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2020). Low credibility.

Imaging of neck pain contributes to a significant proportion of healthcare costs and is expected to increase with practices that heavily use radiologic studies as a diagnostic tool. Though consensus guidelines are available to assist physicians in selecting appropriate imaging examinations for neck pain, it is unclear if ordering practices reflect their use and understanding. To investigate this, we analyzed the number and types of imaging examinations performed for neck pain at a university medical center over the past year. Trends at our institution suggest that clinicians use consensus imaging guidelines, but there is still controversy in the cervical spine regarding when not to image. To promote appropriate imaging utilization, we developed an algorithm to guide imaging of neck pain, based on clinical presentation, referral patterns for neck pain, and a review of the literature.

### Imaging in spinal trauma [^1134exY7]. European Radiology (2005). Low credibility.

Because it may cause paralysis, injury to the spine is one of the most feared traumas, and spinal cord injury is a major cause of disability. In the United States, approximately 10,000 traumatic cervical spine fractures and 4,000 traumatic thoracolumbar fractures are diagnosed each year. Although the number of individuals sustaining paralysis is far less than those with moderate or severe brain injury, the socioeconomic costs are significant. Since most spinal trauma patients survive their injuries, almost one out of every 1,000 inhabitants in the United States is currently being cared for partial or complete paralysis.

Little controversy exists regarding the need for accurate and emergent imaging assessment of the traumatized spine to evaluate spinal stability and the integrity of neural elements. Because clinicians fear missing occult spine injuries, they obtain radiographs for nearly all patients who present with blunt trauma. We are influenced on one side by the fear of litigation and the possible devastating medical, psychological, and financial consequences of cervical spine injury, and on the other side by pressure to reduce healthcare costs.

A set of clinical and/or anamnestic criteria, however, can be very useful in identifying patients who have an extremely low probability of injury and consequently do not need imaging studies. Multidetector (or multislice) computed tomography (MDCT) is the preferred primary imaging modality in blunt spinal trauma patients who do need imaging. Not only is CT more accurate in diagnosing spinal injury, but it also reduces imaging time and patient management delays.

### Evidence-based approach to using CT in spinal trauma [^115LPSqN]. European Journal of Radiology (2003). Low credibility.

Computed tomography has revolutionized the diagnosis and treatment planning of the acutely injured spine. In the cervical spine, its appropriate use can improve outcomes and save money. Although there are no clinical prediction rules validated outside of the cervical spine, these proven capabilities have been extrapolated to the thoracolumbar spine.

### The pearls and pitfalls of magnetic resonance imaging for the spine [^11611R83]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2011). Low credibility.

Musculoskeletal imaging of the spine can be an invaluable tool to inform clinical decision-making in patients with spinal pain. An understanding of the technology involved in producing and interpreting high-resolution images from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the human spine is necessary to better appreciate which sequences can be used for, or tailored to, individual patients and their conditions. However, there is substantial variability in the clinical meaningfulness of some MRI findings of spinal tissues. For example, normal variants can often mimic significant musculoskeletal pathology, which could increase the risk of misinformed clinical decisions and, even worse, poor or adverse outcomes. This clinical commentary will highlight some of the pearls and pitfalls of MRI for the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar regions, and include cases to illustrate some of the common imaging artifacts and normal variants for MRI of the spine.

### Medical imaging of intervertebral disc degeneration: Current status of imaging [^112wNit7]. Spine (2004). Low credibility.

The study design involved a comprehensive review of literature and reports on spine imaging. Key articles featuring novel imaging strategies were selected, and a review was prepared focusing on the currently developing imaging strategies for intervertebral disc degeneration.

- **Objectives**: To provide a detailed review of imaging techniques in intervertebral disc degeneration, with a brief overview of the methodology and an in-depth description of developing techniques.

- **Summary of background data**: Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging offer excellent anatomic images of the spine. However, they often fail to reliably identify the source of pain in patients suffering from intervertebral disc degeneration. Various functional imaging techniques are more suitable for spinal studies, some of which may enhance the understanding of intervertebral disc degeneration and associated clinical symptoms.

- **Methods**: The author selected specific reports from the literature for further review, aiming to succinctly describe the material most relevant to spine imaging.

- **Results**: Innovative and potentially valuable imaging strategies include dynamic computed tomography, dynamic magnetic resonance imaging, functional magnetic resonance imaging, diffusion imaging, and magnetic resonance spectroscopy.

- **Conclusions**: Technological advancements in magnetic resonance and computed tomography imaging continue to present new opportunities for investigating and diagnosing back pain and intervertebral disc degeneration.

### Are upright lateral cervical radiographs in the obtunded trauma patient useful? A retrospective study [^112jH4U5]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

It is widely recognized that MRI is better suited than CT for visualization of the soft tissues. D'Alise et al. argued in favor of MRI prior to CT, citing concerns about the inability to visualize soft tissue changes in the normally aligned spine that is imaged by CT. Conversely, Brohi and co-workers maintain that unstable disc or ligamentous injury may be detected indirectly by CT through evaluation of malalignment or malrotation. Indeed, we have seen subtle abnormalities such as facet joint widening, which led to confirmatory MRI studies. Not surprisingly, MRI has been demonstrated to be very accurate for identifying traumatic disc herniation. The impact of the presence of disc herniations on the decision of whether or not to remove an immobilization device remains unclear.

A recent effort to delineate evidence-based guidelines for the exclusion of cervical instability recommended that MRI be obtained within 48 hours in order to be valid. Horn et al. recently examined the use of MRI for the purpose of identifying posttraumatic instability. In their series of 70 patients whose only positive findings were soft tissue injuries on MRI, none were noted to have instability when flexion-extension radiographs were performed. This finding raises the question as to the value of MRI for identifying cervical instability, as it appears to have a high false-positive rate. Schuster and colleagues conducted a prospective comparison of MRI and CT imaging in patients presenting with blunt trauma and concluded that, for patients without obvious motor weakness, MRI was unnecessary.

### The role of computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging in the diagnosis of pediatric thoracolumbar compression fractures [^115pGzJW]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2019). Low credibility.

Because of concerns about radiation exposure, some centers consider magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) the preferred imaging modality for pediatric thoracic and/or lumbar compression fractures. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the sensitivity of computed tomography (CT) and MRI in diagnosing thoracolumbar compression fractures and the utility of MRI in their management.

- **Methods**: Retrospective review identified 52 patients aged 0 to 18 years with 191 thoracic and/or lumbar compression fractures who had both CT and MRI during the initial trauma evaluation. The decision to perform CT and/or MRI was made by the attending pediatric spine surgeon. In all cases, the CT scan was performed before the MRI. All imaging studies were reviewed by a board-certified pediatric radiologist and attending pediatric spine surgeon.

- **Results**: Only 10 patients (19%) had a single-level injury. Of 42 with multiple compression fractures, 34 (81%) had fractures in contiguous levels, and 8 had noncontiguous injuries. Comparing CT and MRI, there was complete agreement in the number and distribution of fractures in 23 patients (44%). MRI identified additional levels of fracture in 15 patients (29%); 14 (27%) had fewer levels fractured on MRI than CT. Only one patient (2%) had fractures seen on MRI following a normal CT scan. Complete correlation between CT and MRI was seen in 59% (17/29) of patients aged 11 to 18 years, compared with 26% (6/23) of patients younger than 11.

- **Conclusions**: In pediatric patients with mild thoracic or lumbar compression fracture(s), CT scan demonstrates a high level of agreement with MRI in the assessment of fracture severity.

### Controversies in cervical spine imaging in trauma patients [^112kxmaZ]. Emergency Radiology (2004). Low credibility.

No area of emergency radiology has generated as much discussion in recent years as the subject of cervical spine imaging for trauma patients. This review will be in three parts.

- **Indications for cervical imaging**: The first part will examine the indications for cervical imaging and will focus on those factors that make patients at high risk or low risk for cervical injury.

- **Radiography and computed tomography**: The second part will discuss the merits of radiography and computed tomography as the main screening diagnostic examination. In addition to the roles of each modality in the evaluation process, such factors as efficacy of diagnosis, time (duration) of study, and cost will be discussed.

- **Clearing the cervical spine in comatose patients**: Finally, the third part will explore the methods currently employed to "clear" the cervical spine in comatose patients.

### ACR appropriateness criteria suspected spine trauma [^111CAH1g]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2019). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for cervical spine injury, specifically pertaining to cervical imaging, CT, the ACR 2019 guidelines recommend considering the procurement of cervical spine CT, MRI, or X-ray in patients aged 16 years or older with suspected acute blunt trauma of the cervical spine. It is also advised as follow-up imaging in patients where no unstable injury was initially demonstrated but who are kept in a collar for neck pain and exhibit no new neurologic symptoms, including those with whiplash-associated disorders.

### Management of pediatric cervical spine and spinal cord injuries [^112Hc5TH]. Neurosurgery (2013). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for cervical spine injury, more specifically with respect to pediatric patients, the AANS/CNS 2013 guidelines recommend performing thoracic elevation or creating an occipital recess in pediatric patients aged under 8 years. This is to prevent flexion of the head and neck when restrained supine on an otherwise flat backboard, ensuring better neutral alignment and immobilization of the cervical spine.

### Consensus practice guidelines on interventions for cervical spine (facet) joint pain from a multispecialty international working group [^116QpJ3H]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

- **Limitations of fluoroscopy, CT, and US**: The use of fluoroscopy is limited by radiation exposure and an inability to directly visualize the nerve and its trajectory. Additionally, the upfront costs, including the C-arm and monitor, radiology technician, and fluoroscopic table, represent a barrier. For MBB, CT precludes the use of real-time contrast injection or DSA to detect intravascular uptake. Regarding cervical medial branch RFA, the imaging constraints imposed by trajectory recommendations are present but less substantial than in the lumbar spine, enabling parallel or near-parallel placement of electrodes. Yet, the widespread use of CT remains limited because of substantial equipment costs, radiation exposure, lack of real-time vascular imaging, and the need for different patient positions during procedures performed at the upper and lower facet joints.

- **Use of ultrasound (US)**: The use of US may provide an alternative imaging modality for the performance of MBB, but it is not ideal for cervical IA injections or medial branch RFA that require a set trajectory. Although US is portable, can be used in pregnancy, and does not require the use of protective garments, there are significant disadvantages of using US guidance for cervical spine interventions. US cannot visualize the entire field, including adjacent levels, thereby increasing the risk of incorrect level identification. Widespread adoption may also be limited by anatomic difficulties associated with specific anatomic levels in the neck, especially involving C7. Of note, the US-guided approach to the cervical medial branch is less commonly taught.

### Interobserver agreement of whole-body magnetic resonance imaging is superior to whole-body computed tomography for assessing disease burden in patients with multiple myeloma [^111iy4PR]. European Radiology (2020). Low credibility.

For each body region (skull, cervical spine, thoracic spine, lumbar spine, pelvis, ribs/other, long bones), two radiologists, each with over 10 years of experience, were blinded to clinical information and MRI findings. They categorized disease burden on WB-CT using a previously described scoring system. This allowed assessment of the number of lesions: score 3 for more than 20 lesions, score 2 for 10–20 lesions, and score 1 for fewer than 10 lesions. Additionally, lesion dimensions were scored: score 3 for lesions larger than 20 mm, score 2 for 10–20 mm, score 1 for 5–10 mm, and score 0 for those under 5 mm. The maximum lesion dimension was measured on the window setting where the lesion was most readily appreciated. A total score was calculated for the whole skeleton. To finalize observer scores, discrepancies were resolved through a consensus reading facilitated by a third experienced radiologist.

At a separate session, the image reading was repeated for the WB-MRI data, with readers blinded to clinical information and CT findings. The maximum lesion dimension was measured on the sequence where the lesion was most readily appreciated. The image reading for WB-CT and WB-MRI was subsequently repeated by another pair of junior radiologists with less than one year of experience as consultants.

### Variation in pediatric cervical spine imaging across trauma centers-a cause for concern [^115qYozr]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2021). Low credibility.

Nonetheless, variability in imaging performance is to be expected to a certain extent, and our findings should not be interpreted as an indictment on inadequate guideline adherence. Each of the published algorithms allows for subjective clinical assessment, physician suspicion, and physician experience to factor into individual imaging decisions. Given the gravity of missing CSI in children, physicians, especially those at less specialized centers who are also less accustomed to caring for pediatric trauma patients, may be taking a "better safe than sorry" diagnostic approach.

Another important possibility to consider, especially in the context of older pediatric trauma patients, is that providers might have been using adult cervical spine clearance algorithms; unfortunately, it is likely that this issue persists today. In 2016, Duane et al. published the findings from a decade-long study to determine the best practice for clearance of the cervical spine in the setting of adult trauma patients meeting the Centers for Disease Control trauma team alert criteria. The authors declared that any adult trauma patient meeting the Centers for Disease Control trauma team alert should undergo a CT scan which captures the cervical spine. Hence, providers at adult trauma centers today who immediately request cervical spine CT scans for the initial evaluation of pediatric trauma patients might actually be following guidelines (in)appropriately because they either lack familiarity with the pediatric-specific protocols or believe the pediatric patient is old enough to meet adult criteria.

### ACR appropriateness criteria suspected spine trauma [^112PTPBX]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2019). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for cervical spine injury, specifically concerning cervical imaging, the ACR 2019 guidelines recommend not obtaining imaging in patients aged ≥ 16 years and < 65 years with suspected acute blunt cervical spine trauma if imaging is not indicated by NEXUS or Canadian C-Spine Rule clinical criteria, and the patient meets low-risk criteria.

### Computed tomography versus magnetic resonance imaging of the cervical spine in the spinal clearance of trauma patients: A systematic review and meta-analyses [^111PAoz5]. European Spine Journal (2025). Low credibility.

- **Purpose**: Assess the proportion of trauma patients with missed cervical spine injuries that magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) identifies following a negative computed tomography (CT); perform subgroup analyses based on age and Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) on presentation; evaluate treatment changes due to MRI findings.

- **Methods**: This systematic review and meta-analyses were conducted with reference to the PRISMA guidelines. We included studies investigating cervical spine clearance in trauma patients using CT and MRI. Outcomes of interest included the number of injuries each modality identified, and the number of treatment changes prompted by MRI findings. Outcomes were expressed as proportions and their 95% confidence intervals (95% CI).

- **Results**: Thirty-six studies involving 6,784 patients were analysed. MRI identified missed injuries in 17% of patients following a negative CT (proportions: 0.17, 95% CI 0.12–0.23). Subgroup analyses showed that paediatrics (proportions: 0.32, 95% CI 0.13–0.58) were at higher risk of missed injuries than adults (proportions: 0.13, 95% CI 0.05–0.27), and that alert patients (proportions: 0.28, 95% CI 0.13–0.48) were at higher risk of missed injuries than obtunded patients (proportions: 0.14, 95% CI 0.08–0.23). Clinically significant injuries identified on MRI prompted treatment changes in 4% of patients (proportions: 0.04, 95% CI 0.02–0.07).

- **Conclusion**: Trauma patients with a negative CT cervical spine had a 17% chance of missed injuries if MRI cervical spine was not performed, with paediatrics demonstrating a higher risk.

### Pitfalls in multidetector computed tomography imaging of traumatic spinal injuries [^116ARTw9]. Emergency Radiology (2011). Low credibility.

The advent of multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) has largely supplanted plain radiography as the recommended primary imaging modality for the evaluation of acute spinal injuries. Although MDCT is highly sensitive and specific for bony injuries, errors in diagnosis can still occur. Knowledge of the possible imaging pitfalls on MDCT, leading to either misdiagnosis of fractures or missed fractures, is vital in ensuring an accurate diagnosis.

This paper serves to highlight conditions that can mimic or reduce the sensitivity for the detection of acute spinal injuries, as well as demonstrate imaging findings which aid in the detection and diagnosis of subtle spinal injuries. Review areas for clinically relevant extra-spinal findings in the context of trauma will also be discussed.

### Magnetic resonance imaging of the lumbar spine: Recommendations for acquisition and image evaluation from the BACPAC spine imaging working group [^112DVn27]. Pain Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Based on the MRI data acquired, we propose qualitative/semi-quantitative image evaluation (e.g. using ordinal rating scales) using structured reporting with a predefined scoring system that incorporates the different structures and related grading of pathology as captured by the FOV of the T1- and T2-weighted sequences (Modic-type endplate changes, endplate defects, intervertebral disc changes, FJ and SIJ changes, and stenosis).

- **Modic changes**: Modic-type endplate changes summarize three categories based on specific signal characteristics of vertebral bone marrow adjacent to the endplates in MRI. Most commonly, type 1 changes are considered an inflammatory, fibrovascular stage and may indicate an ongoing active degenerative process (e.g. disruption and fissuring of endplates and formation of granulation tissue). Type 2 changes are related to fatty degenerative remodeling processes, with replacement of red by yellow bone marrow within the vertebrae. Furthermore, type 3 changes reflect the sclerotic stage. Related to their suggested pathophysiological entity, the three different types of Modic-type endplate changes differ in their appearances using the combination of sagittal T1- and T2-weighted sequences, with Modic changes type 1 typically showing hypointense signal on T1- and hyperintense signal on T2-weighted images, Modic changes type 2 showing hyperintense signal on T1- and hyper- or iso-intense signal on T2-weighted images without fat suppression (typically relatively hypointense on T2-weighted images with fat suppression), and Modic changes type 3 showing hypointense signal on T1- and T2-weighted images.

### Age-related changes of thoracic and cervical intervertebral discs in asymptomatic subjects [^111j9uab]. Spine (2010). Low credibility.

This magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study examines the degeneration of the thoracic spine in asymptomatic subjects. The objective is to investigate the incidence of degenerative MRI findings of the thoracic spine in asymptomatic individuals and to identify factors related to the degeneration of the thoracic discs.

Studies on age-related degenerative changes of the thoracic spine are scarce. In this study, ninety-four asymptomatic Japanese volunteers (48 men and 46 women, mean age of 48.0 ± 13.4 years) underwent MRI of the thoracic and cervical spine and completed a questionnaire regarding lifestyles. The items evaluated on MRI using a numerical grading system were:

- **Decrease in the signal intensity of the intervertebral discs (DSI)**: Assessed for correlation with various factors.
- **Posterior disc protrusion (PDP)**: Investigated in relation to demographic and lifestyle factors.
- **Anterior compression of the dural sac (ACD)**: Evaluated for its association with age and other factors.
- **Disc space narrowing**: Analyzed in the context of influencing factors.

This study examined the association between each degenerative MRI finding and several factors, including age, sex, smoking, sports, body mass index, and degeneration of the cervical spine.

Forty-four (46.8%) patients demonstrated positive degenerative MRI findings at one or more thoracic intervertebral levels. The percentage of subjects with positive MRI findings was 37.2% in DSI, 30.9% in PDP, 29.8% in ACD, and 4.3% in disc space narrowing. The percentages of all MRI findings increased with aging. In 85 (90.4%) patients, degenerative MRI findings were positive in the cervical spine. DSI was significantly associated with age (odds ratio, 11.21, 95% confidence interval, 2.70–46.5); PDP also exhibited an association with age (odds ratio, 3.44, 1.02–16.6).

### Helical computed tomography alone compared with plain radiographs with adjunct computed tomography to evaluate the cervical spine after high-energy trauma [^111CiyWx]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery. American Volume (2005). Low credibility.

Literature supports the use of the three-view plain radiograph series, supplemented when necessary with helical computed tomography (CT), to evaluate the cervical spine in patients who have sustained a trauma injury. This study aimed to determine if helical CT alone can evaluate the cervical spine for acute osseous injury following high-energy trauma, thus potentially eliminating the need for radiographs.

- **Methods**: Patients were prospectively evaluated with helical CT scanning of the cervical spine and standard three-view plain radiography. At a later date, the plain radiographs and CT scans were independently reviewed by two radiologists who were blinded to both the initial interpretation and the interpretation of the corresponding study. The radiologists documented whether the plain radiographs were adequate and whether they showed an acute process. The findings in the study were compared with the initial findings and, when necessary, with the discharge summaries to determine if an injury had been identified. The accuracy of the plain radiographs, of the plain radiographs that had been deemed adequate, and of helical CT used alone was ascertained.

- **Results**: Plain radiographs and helical CT scans were made for 407 patients, and traumatic injuries were identified in fifty-eight of them. Plain radiographs alone were adequate for 194 (48%) of the 407 patients. Plain radiographs had a sensitivity of 45%, a specificity of 97%, and a positive predictive value of 74%.

### Comparative analysis of three imaging modalities for evaluation of cervical sagittal alignment parameters: A validity and reliability study [^115TdYXJ]. Spine (2017). Low credibility.

This was a radiologic validity and reliability study. The objective was to assess the validity and reliability of measurements from standing lateral cervical radiography (XR), reconstructed midsagittal images of supine cervical computerized tomography (CT) scans, and supine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for evaluating C2-C7 distance (C27 SVA), C2-C7 Cobb angle (CL), T1 slope (T1S), thoracic inlet angle (TIA), and neck tilt (NT).

XR is the criterion standard imaging modality for measuring cervical sagittal alignment parameters. However, overlapping bony structures and soft tissue often make the upper end of the manubrium and cervicothoracic junction indiscernible. CT and MRI can overcome this limitation, but their reliability and validity have not been fully elucidated.

Fifty sets of three examinations from our database were randomly selected. Three experienced spinal surgeons independently measured C27 SVA, CL, T1S, TIA, and NT. Paired t-tests and Pearson correlation were used to analyze the validity of CT and MRI in comparison with that of XR. Interobserver and intraobserver reliability were assessed by using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC).

The paired t-test confirmed the similarities of all CT (except C27 SVA) and MR parameters (except C27 SVA and CL) to the XR parameters (all P > 0.05). All parameters except C27 SVA were correlated (Pearson correlation coefficient, 0.523–0.913). Correlation was highest between CT and MRI and lowest between CT and XR.

### Mdct and MRI evaluation of cervical spine trauma [^114wne7g]. Insights into imaging (2014). Low credibility.

The cervical spine is susceptible to a variety of stable and unstable injuries. Depending on the mechanism of trauma, injuries in this region are associated with high morbidity and mortality. MDCT and MRI are frequently complementary studies in trauma. MDCT is able to identify osseous injuries and assess for cervical malalignment in the acute setting. MRI can further assess injuries in patients with MDCT findings or assess for occult injury when MDCT is normal. It is critical that the radiologist is familiar with appearances of cervical spine injury on both MDCT and MRI.

### Imaging features of the postoperative spine: A guide to basic understanding of spine surgical procedures [^1137FY1j]. Insights into Imaging (2023). High credibility.

Since the evaluation of the postoperative spine is challenging, it is of utmost importance to have a basic understanding of the indications and objectives of the main surgical procedures, as well as the hardware instrumentation materials and their normal appearance through imaging. One should be familiar with the most appropriate imaging modality for each setting, including radiographs, CT, MRI, or nuclear medicine studies. Comparison with previous exams and access to surgical descriptions are always helpful and support imaging evaluation. The ultimate goal is to create efficient reports to assist the surgeon in continuous patient care.

### Pediatric cervical spine injury evaluation after blunt trauma: a clinical decision analysis [^114C6MVH]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Although many adult algorithms for evaluating cervical spine injury use computed tomography (CT) as the initial screening modality, this may not be appropriate in low-risk children considering radiation risks. We determine the optimal initial evaluation strategy for cervical spine injury in pediatric blunt trauma.

- **Methods**: We constructed a decision analysis tree for a hypothetical population of patients younger than 19 years with blunt trauma, using three strategies: clinical stratification, screening radiographs followed by focused CT if the radiograph result was positive, and CT. For the model inputs, we used the literature to determine the probabilities of cervical spine injury and estimate the long-term risks of malignancy after CT, as well as test characteristics of radiographic imaging. We used published utilities and conducted one- and two-way sensitivity analyses to determine the optimal strategy for the evaluation of pediatric cervical spine injury.

- **Results**: In our model of a population with blunt trauma, the expected value of a clinical stratification strategy was the highest of the three strategies, making it the overall preferred management. One-way sensitivity analysis of several contributing factors revealed that the only independent factor that altered the dominant strategy was the sensitivity of clinical clearance criteria, lowering the threshold at which a screening-radiograph strategy is optimal. Within the patient population considered as having non-negligible risk by clinical stratification and thus requiring imaging, the preferred imaging modal…

### Cervical spinal clearance: A prospective Western Trauma Association multi-institutional trial [^116zKsEK]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

For blunt trauma patients who have failed the NEXUS (National Emergency X-Radiography Utilization Study) low-risk criteria, the adequacy of computed tomography (CT) as the definitive imaging modality for clearance remains controversial. The purpose of this study was to prospectively evaluate the accuracy of CT for the detection of clinically significant cervical spine (C-spine) injury.

- **Methods**: This was a prospective multicenter observational study conducted from September 2013 to March 2015 at 18 North American trauma centers. All adult patients (≥ 18 years old) with blunt trauma underwent a structured clinical examination. NEXUS failures underwent a CT scan of the C-spine with clinical follow-up until discharge. The primary outcome measure was the sensitivity and specificity of CT for clinically significant injuries requiring surgical stabilization, halo, or cervical-thoracic orthotic placement, using the criterion standard of the final diagnosis at the time of discharge, incorporating all imaging and operative findings.

- **Results**: A total of 10,765 patients met the inclusion criteria while 489 (4.5%) were excluded due to previous spinal instrumentation or transfer from outside hospitals. Ultimately, 10,276 patients (4,660 [45.3%] had unevaluable or distracting injuries, 5,040 [49.0%] had midline C-spine tenderness, and 576 [5.6%] had neurologic symptoms) were prospectively enrolled. The mean age of patients was 48.1 years (range, 18–110 years). Participants had a systolic blood pressure of 138 mm Hg (SD, 26) and a median Glasgow Coma Scale score of 15 (IQR, 14–15). The Injury Severity Score was 9 (IQR, 4–16). Overall, 198 (1.9%) had a clinically significant C-spine injury requiring intervention.

### Are flexion extension films necessary for cervical spine clearance in patients with neck pain after negative cervical CT scan [^116GdWzH]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2013). Low credibility.

There are variations in cervical spine (CS) clearance protocols in neurologically intact blunt trauma patients with negative radiological imaging but persistent neck pain. Guidelines from the Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma include options of maintaining the cervical collar or obtaining either magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or flexion-extension films (FEF). We evaluated the utility of FEF in the era of routine computerized tomography (CT) for imaging the CS in trauma.

- **Materials and methods**: All neurologically intact, awake, non-intoxicated patients who underwent FEF for persistent neck pain following a negative CT scan of the CS at our level I trauma center over a 13-month period were identified. Their charts were reviewed and demographic data obtained.

- **Results**: There were 354 patients (58.5% male) with negative cervical CS CT scans who had FEF for residual neck pain. Incidental degenerative changes were seen in 37% — which did not affect their acute management. FEF were positive for possible ligamentous injury in 5 patients (1.4%). Two of these patients had negative magnetic resonance images, and the other three had collars removed within 3 weeks as the findings were ultimately determined to be degenerative.

- **Conclusions**: In an era where cervical CT has universally supplanted initial plain films, FEF appear to be of little value in the evaluation of persistent neck pain. Their use should be excluded from cervical spine clearance protocols in neurologically intact, awake patients.

### Trends and variation in cervical spine imaging utilization across children's hospitals for pediatric trauma [^113wCMtH]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2024). Low credibility.

Cervical spine (c-spine) evaluation is a critical component in trauma evaluation. Although several pediatric c-spine evaluation algorithms have been developed, none have been widely implemented. Here, we assess rates of c-spine imaging use across children's hospitals, specifically looking at temporal trends in imaging use, variation across hospitals in imaging practice, and the timing of magnetic resonance imaging in admitted patients.

- **Methods**: Data from the Children's Hospital Association's Pediatric Health Information System were abstracted from 2015 to 2020. Patients younger than 18 years seen in the emergency department with an International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, code indicative of trauma and c-spine plain radiograph or computed tomography (CT) in the emergency department were included. Data visualization and descriptive statistics were used to assess rates of imaging use by age, year, hospital, injury severity, and day of service. Changes in rates of imaging use over time were evaluated via simple linear regression.

- **Results**: Across 25,238 patient encounters at 35 children's hospitals, there was an increase in the use of c-spine CT from 2015 to 2020 (28.5–36.5%). There was substantial interinstitutional variation in rates of use of plain radiographs versus CT for initial evaluation of the c-spine across all age groups. Magnetic resonance imaging was obtained more than 3 days after admission in 31.5% of intensive care patients who received this imaging.

- **Conclusion**: Increasing use of CT and substantial interinstitutional variation in rates of use of plain radiographs versus CT for initial evaluation of the c-spine were observed.

### Preoperative magnetic resonance imaging screening for a surgical decision regarding the approach for anterior spine fusion at the cervicothoracic junction [^116Y7RR1]. Spine (2002). Low credibility.

In a study investigating the correlation between a set of designed criteria and judgments of surgical experience, 100 cervical magnetic resonance images from different patients were used.

- **Objectives**: To demonstrate reliable and reproducible anatomic measurements that can aid spine surgeons in selecting surgical approaches for anterior spine fusion in the cervicothoracic region.

- **Background data**: Surgical approaches to the cervicothoracic junction vary among surgeons. Although sternotomy provides maximum exposure, less extensive approaches are preferred to minimize surgical trauma, provided surgical goals are not compromised. No quantitative criteria currently exist to determine before surgery the least invasive surgical approach for sufficiently exposing pertinent anatomy.

- **Methods**: Thirteen geometric variables designed to be clinically practical and to expose important anatomic relations were used to evaluate 100 sagittal scout cervical magnetic resonance image sequences. An experienced spine surgeon independently rated each image for the most appropriate surgical approach to the C5-T2 region. The ratings were tested for interrater reliability using a second spine surgeon. After testing for interrater and intrarater reliability, the geometric measurements were correlated with the surgeon's selected surgical approaches for each intervertebral segment (P < 0.05).

- **Results**: Instrument manubrial thoracic distances, reflecting standardized heights of intervertebral discs above or below the superior tip of the manubrium, were the most reliable, reproduci.

### Normal fetal development of the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine: A postmortem study based on magnetic resonance imaging [^112qGZyd]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2021). Low credibility.

Before evaluating spinal pathology, it is essential to have knowledge of the normal spinal development at different gestational ages. This study aims to characterize normal spinal growth in human fetuses during the second and third trimesters.

- **Methods**: Postmortem 3.0 T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed on 55 fetuses at 17–42 gestational weeks, using three-dimensional T2-weighted sequences. Morphological changes and quantitative measurements of the fetal spine were assessed. The correlation between centrum ossification center volume (COCV) and gestational age was investigated.

- **Results**: The cervical, thoracic, and lumbar COCVs showed a positive relationship with gestational age (p < 0.05). No gender differences were found in the volumetric development of the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar centrum ossification centers (COCs). The average volumetric growth rate per COC was larger in the lumbar spine than in the cervical and thoracic spine. The L1-L5 COCVs also showed a linear positive relationship with gestational age.

- **Consults**: Postmortem 3.0 T MRI clearly demonstrated spinal changes in external contour and internal structure with gestational age. These findings expand our understanding of the early growth pattern of the human spine and could be further used to assess the developmental conditions of the fetal spine.

### What should an ideal spinal injury classification system consist of? A methodological review and conceptual proposal for future classifications [^117Wdojd]. European Spine Journal (2010). Low credibility.

A dramatic shift in the diagnostic work-up of spinal injuries has occurred over the past several years. In contrast to a decade ago, computed tomography (CT) scans of the spine are now being routinely performed during the diagnostic work-up in approximately 80% of level I trauma centers. Not without reason. Increasing evidence supports the use of (multi-detector) CT of the spine rather than conventional radiography in the diagnostic work-up of patients at both high risk and low risk of spinal injuries. Moreover, with respect to clearance of the spine, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the spine is currently not indicated in the absence of CT abnormalities and neurological deficits. CT images have shown to be more accurate in the visualization of potentially prognostic spinal injury characteristics than conventional radiographs and MRI. In addition, physicians may come to different treatment decisions after examining additional CT images.

Given this brief summary of recent advances in the diagnostic work-up of spinal injuries, it is clear that the contents of a contemporary spinal injury classification should primarily be based on the increasingly routinely performed CT imaging.

### Imaging of cervical spine traumas [^113vbD9N]. European Journal of Radiology (2019). Low credibility.

Spinal traumas represent a significant proportion of musculoskeletal injuries worldwide. These injuries involve a complex structure with components of differing traumatic susceptibility and variable healing capabilities. The interaction of numerous variables at the time of trauma creates a wide variety of lesions, making it challenging to create and compare homogeneous groups. This has led to difficulties in classifying spinal lesions, assessing their instability, and defining the indication and outcome of different treatment strategies. The evolution of concepts on instability has accompanied that of trauma classification schemes and treatment strategies.

The assessment of instability in a spinal injury is crucial, particularly in light of newer surgical techniques and hardware. Despite a long history of attempts to classify spinal traumas, there remains some degree of controversy in describing imaging data and a wide variety of treatment strategies. Acute cervical spine injuries affect 1.9% to 4.6% of individuals reporting blunt trauma, and up to 5.9% of multiple-injured patients. Most spinal cord injuries result from unstable fractures of the cervical spine. An accurate and early diagnosis is mandatory to prevent neurological damage in unstable fractures.

Classic and newer classifications are primarily based on features identifiable using conventional imaging and CT scans, which are the most available modalities at most trauma centers. Although multidetector CT remains superior in assessing bone injuries with high accuracy, MRI is the most sensitive imaging modality.

### An evidenced-based approach to radiographic assessment of cervical spine injuries in the emergency department [^116gfRuc]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

The modern approach to suspected cervical spine injuries is highly dependent on the appropriate utilization of radiographic studies. Clinical decision rules have been developed to determine those most likely to benefit from plain film studies, but there is confusion regarding those who should undergo computed tomography (CT) scanning. This case-based review highlights the available evidence and provides a framework to guide emergency medicine providers in the treatment of patients with trauma to the cervical spine.

### Spinal injury: Optimising the imaging options [^112viGw2]. European Journal of Radiology (2002). Low credibility.

There have been numerous documented attempts to formulate risk-based guidelines for the exclusion of spinal injury using conventional radiography. The advent of computed tomography (CT), including spiral and multi-slice, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has confirmed the known limitations of conventional radiography. Despite this, there remains a need to define the optional use of these modalities in a trauma setting. This chapter addresses these issues by reviewing the literature and providing a synopsis of the thinking in the appropriate sections, such as adult, paediatric, symptomatic, and asymptomatic, in the quest to determine the best approaches for excluding or confirming spinal trauma.

### Mdct and mri evaluation of cervical spine trauma [^1163LxTB]. Insights into Imaging (2014). Low credibility.

In most emergency departments, MDCT is the fastest and most practical study for cervical spine injury following trauma. With this technique, a high-spatial-resolution thin-section axial data set can be acquired with reformats in the sagittal and coronal planes using algorithms optimized for the evaluation of bones and soft tissues. MDCT is excellent for the timely detection of bony injuries, hematomas involving the paravertebral soft tissues, and signs of subcutaneous soft tissue trauma. MDCT may detect epidural and subdural hematomas; however, small collections may sometimes be overlooked.

MRI is a critical follow-up study in patients with severe trauma to the cervical spine. MRI is the modality of choice for the assessment of extra-osseous injuries, such as epidural hematomas and ligamentous disruption, in patients with negative CT studies but a high index of suspicion for injury. Additionally, in patients with confirmed cervical spine injury on MDCT, MRI can more fully evaluate the extent of associated soft tissue injuries. T1 sequences are excellent for surveying the anatomy and caliber of the spinal cord, while T2 images with and without fat saturation are used to identify epidural fluid collections, ligamentous disruption, edema, and herniated discs.

### The Canadian C-spine rule for radiography in alert and stable trauma patients [^113A66DS]. JAMA (2001). High credibility.

The Canadian C-Spine Rule (CCR) is a clinical decision-making tool designed for use in the emergency department to determine which trauma patients need cervical spine imaging. This tool is specifically applicable to alert and stable patients who have experienced trauma, with the goal of reducing unnecessary imaging procedures. The CCR is not intended for use in patients under the age of 16, those with penetrating trauma, acute paralysis, known vertebral disease, or those with a previous cervical spine surgery. The clinical utility of the CCR lies in its ability to accurately identify patients at high risk of cervical spine injury, thereby improving patient management and reducing healthcare costs.

To evaluate neck injuries using the CCR, the calculator examines specific risk factors and assigns scores to assess whether imaging is required. The assessment focuses on three areas: high-risk factors, low-risk factors, and neck rotation ability. Each area is given a numerical score that corresponds to the presence of certain conditions.

- **High-risk factors**: These are critical in determining the need for imaging and include:
	- Age 65 years or older
	- Paresthesias in extremities
	- Dangerous mechanisms of injury such as falls from a height of 1 meter or more, axial load to the head, high-speed motor vehicle collisions, rollovers, ejections, motorized recreational vehicle accidents, or bicycle collisions

### How to image patients with spine pain [^111c12kR]. European Journal of Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

Different radiological methods play an important role in the work-up of patients complaining of spine pain. Depending on the symptoms and the suspected underlying etiology, different methods are selected. In this presentation, we briefly introduce the various radiological and magnetic resonance tomography methods available. We provide guidance on which method to use and present the typical imaging findings associated with some of the most common conditions that manifest with spine pain.

### Radiographic assessment [^1144nW4p]. Neurosurgery (2013). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for cervical spine injury, more specifically with respect to cervical imaging, radiography, the AANS/CNS 2013 guidelines recommend obtaining a 3-view cervical spine X-ray (anteroposterior, lateral, and odontoid views) in patients with symptoms of suspected cervical spinal cord injury if CT is unavailable. A follow-up CT should be obtained when it becomes available to further define areas that are suspicious or not well visualized on plain cervical X-rays.

### Management of pediatric cervical spine and spinal cord injuries [^115ZLJRA]. Neurosurgery (2013). High credibility.

The American Association of Neurological Surgeons/Congress of Neurological Surgeons (AANS/CNS) 2013 guidelines recommend against obtaining cervical spine imaging in alert pediatric trauma patients with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score greater than 13. This applies to patients aged 3 months or older in cases where the injury involved a fall from a height greater than 10 feet or when non-accidental trauma is a known or suspected mechanism of injury.

### Spinal alignment shift between supine and prone CT imaging occurs frequently and regardless of the anatomic region, risk factors, or pathology [^113ymAVi]. Neurosurgical Review (2022). Low credibility.

For alignment analysis depending on the region of instrumentation, the Cobb angle (CA) was best suited for shift detection at the cervical-thoracic region (CA: ✱ p = 0.049 for cervical, ✱ p = 0.048 for cervical-thoracic, ✱ p = 0.048 for thoracic) and the plumbline (PL) at the thoraco-lumbar spine (PL: ✱✱ p = 0.003 for thoraco-lumbar; see Fig. 3). Interestingly, none of the parameters detected a significant shift when analyzing alignment depending on the pathology, and no difference was found in the degree of shift between anatomic regions or the underlying pathology (p > 0.05 for individual comparisons of the anatomic region and underlying pathology for ∆CA, ∆PL, and ∆T).

- **Illustrative data**:
	- Bar graphs display comparisons between preoperative and intraoperative subaxial spinal alignment as determined by the modified Cobb angle (CA), plumbline (PL), and translation (T).
	- Analysis is segmented according to the anatomic region of instrumentation (left panels) and the underlying pathology (right panels).
	- Statistical significance was evaluated using the Wilcoxon matched pairs signed rank test.

### Consensus practice guidelines on interventions for cervical spine (facet) joint pain from a multispecialty international working group [^116YCRaZ]. Pain Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

- **Limitations of fluoroscopy, CT, and US**: The use of fluoroscopy is limited by radiation exposure and an inability to directly visualize the nerve and its trajectory. Additionally, the upfront costs, including the C-arm and monitor, radiology technician, and fluoroscopic table, represent a barrier. For medial branch blocks (MBB), CT precludes the use of real-time contrast injection or digital subtraction angiography (DSA) to detect intravascular uptake. Regarding cervical medial branch radiofrequency ablation (RFA), the imaging constraints imposed by trajectory recommendations are present but less substantial than in the lumbar spine, enabling parallel or near-parallel placement of electrodes. Yet, the widespread use of CT remains limited because of substantial equipment costs, radiation exposure, lack of real-time vascular imaging, and the need for different patient positions during procedures performed at the upper and lower facet joints.

Use of ultrasound (US) may provide an alternative imaging modality for the performance of MBB, but it is not ideal for cervical intra-articular (IA) injections or medial branch RFA that require a set trajectory. Although US is portable, can be used in pregnancy, and does not require the use of protective garments, there are significant disadvantages of using US guidance for cervical spine interventions. US cannot visualize the entire field, including adjacent levels, thereby increasing the risk of incorrect level identification. Widespread adoption may also be limited by anatomic difficulties associated with specific anatomic levels in the neck, especially involving C7. Of note, the US-guided approach to the cervical medial branch is less commonly taught.

### Cervical ribs: identification on MRI and clinical relevance [^1126xmCy]. Clinical Imaging (2013). Low credibility.

To determine the prevalence of cervical ribs on cervical spine MRI and their clinical relevance, we reviewed 2,500 studies for cervical ribs and compression of neurovascular structures and compared them to CT, when available. Contact with the brachial plexus or subclavian artery by a cervical rib was identified on MRI and/or CT in 12 cases, with a diagnosis of thoracic outlet syndrome in one case. Cervical ribs were identified in 1.2% (25/2083) of examinations, which is lower than on CT (2%), but MRI may offer an equivalent anatomic explanation for patient symptoms.

### CT versus plain radiographs for evaluation of c-spine injury in young children: Do benefits outweigh risks [^112kQxzv]. Pediatric Radiology (2008). Low credibility.

Various reports support the use of cervical spine (c-spine) CT over conventional radiography in the screening of c-spine injury. Interest now exists in diagnostic radiation-induced morbidity.

- **Objective**: To estimate the excess relative risk for developing cancer from c-spine high-resolution CT radiation exposure.

- **Materials and Methods**: We conducted a retrospective review of children evaluated for c-spine injury using CT. The study population was divided into three age groups: 0–4 years (group 1), 5–8 years (group 2), and older than 8 years (group 3). Anthropomorphic 1-year-old and 5-year-old phantoms were used to measure radiation at the thyroid during radiography and CT. Excess relative risk for thyroid cancer was estimated using these measurements.

- **Results**: A total of 557 patients were evaluated with CT. The radiographic method most commonly used was head CT/c-spine CT in 363 (65%). Only 179 children (32%) had any type of prior radiography. The use of c-spine CT exposes the thyroid to 90–200 times more radiation than multiple conventional radiographs. The mean excess relative risk for thyroid cancer after CT was 2.0 for group 1 and 0.6 for group 2. There were no comparison data for group 3.

- **Conclusion**: C-spine CT is associated with significant exposure to ionizing radiation and increases excess relative risk for thyroid cancer in young children.

### Diagnostic imaging of cervical spine injuries following blunt trauma: A review of the literature and practical guideline [^113QAubL]. Injury (2009). Low credibility.

Patients with a potential cervical spine injury can be subdivided into low-risk and high-risk categories. With a detailed history and physical examination, the cervical spine of patients in the "low-risk" group can be "cleared" without further radiographic examinations. X-ray imaging (3-view series) is currently the primary choice of imaging for these patients following blunt trauma.

For patients in the "high-risk" group, a computed tomography scan is primarily advised due to its higher sensitivity. Alternatively, the cervical spine may be immobilized until the patient can be reliably questioned and examined again. For imaging traumatic soft tissue injuries of the cervical spine, magnetic resonance imaging is the technique of choice.

### Cervical spine clearance: A review [^111RsufC]. Injury (2005). Low credibility.

Ethical concerns have hindered any randomized controlled blinded studies on the imaging required to assess the cervical spine in an unconscious trauma patient. The issue has been contentious for many years and has resulted in burgeoning but inconclusive guidance. MRI and multislice CT technology have made rapid advances, but the literature is slower to catch up. Nevertheless, there appears to be an emerging consensus for the multiply injured patient: the rapid primary clinical survey should be followed by lateral cervical spine, chest, and pelvic radiographs.

If a patient is unconscious, then a CT of the brain and at least down to C3 (and in the United States, down to D1) has now become routine. The cranio-cervical scans should be a maximum of 2 mm thickness, and probably less, as undisplaced type II peg fractures can be invisible even on 1 mm slices with reconstructions. If the lateral cervical radiograph and the CT scan are negative, then MRI is the investigation of choice to exclude instability.

Patients with focal neurological signs, evidence of cord or disc injury, and patients whose surgery requires pre-operative cord assessment should be imaged by MRI. It is also the investigation of choice for evaluating the complications and late sequelae of trauma. If the patient is to have an MRI scan, the MR unit must be able to at least do a sagittal STIR sequence of the entire vertebral column to exclude non-contiguous injuries, which, since the advent of MRI, are now known to be relatively common. Any areas of edema or collapse then require detailed CT evaluation.
