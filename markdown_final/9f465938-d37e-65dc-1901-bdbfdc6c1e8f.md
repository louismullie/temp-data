## Question

What is the recommended dosage for: Prevention of early aneurysmal rebleeding in adults with subarachnoid hemorrhage?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the recommended dosage of antifibrinolytic therapy to prevent early aneurysmal rebleeding in adults with subarachnoid hemorrhage. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and why antifibrinolytics were considered. Then, I should verify the highest-quality evidence and guideline positions. Next, I will examine dosing regimens from key trials and weigh benefits versus harms. After that, I need to check for any subgroup or timing nuances. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, guideline-concordant recommendation and note exceptions or controversies, making sure I cite the most authoritative sources throughout.

> Let me first confirm the clinical problem and why antifibrinolytics were ever used. Early rebleeding after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage is common and deadly, with the highest risk in the first 24 hours and a substantial proportion of rebleeds occurring after hospital arrival, which is why strategies to stabilize the clot were explored historically [^393026e6] [^952c3e26].

> Wait, let me verify the highest-quality evidence before jumping to dosing. The ULTRA randomized trial tested ultra-early, short-course tranexamic acid and found no improvement in functional outcomes at 6 months, despite a modest reduction in rebleeding, and this neutral result shifted practice away from routine antifibrinolytics. Contemporary guidelines from the AHA/ASA and the Neurocritical Care Society now recommend against routine antifibrinolytic therapy for this indication [^e6261298] [^a4409a5c] [^a4409a5c].

> I should double-check the balance of benefits and harms. Meta-analytic data show that while antifibrinolytics reduce rebleeding, they increase ischemic stroke risk and do not improve mortality or functional outcomes, and ULTRA specifically did not show a clinically meaningful benefit on rebleeding or outcome, reinforcing that the risk-benefit is unfavorable in routine practice [^a4409a5c] [^e6261298].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about dosing if the intervention itself is not recommended. But if someone is considering off-label use in select circumstances, I need to check what regimens were actually studied. The ULTRA protocol used 1 gram IV tranexamic acid as soon as possible after CT-confirmed SAH, followed by 1 gram IV every 6 hours for a maximum of 24 hours, with a median time to treatment of about 3 hours; earlier, a multicenter trial used 1 gram IV every 6 hours up to 72 hours or until aneurysm securement, and observational cohorts of epsilon-aminocaproic acid used approximately 40 grams total over about 35–72 hours, though these latter data are lower quality and heterogeneous [^e6261298] [^658ac4a1] [^9d1030ef].

> I need to ensure I capture timing nuances. Post hoc analyses suggest any effect of tranexamic acid on rebleeding may be modified by time to treatment, with a signal of benefit only when started after 6 hours, which is counterintuitive and likely reflects chance or bias; importantly, even where rebleeding decreased, functional outcomes were unchanged, so this does not rescue the intervention for routine use [^4e7770a8] [^d016e713].

> Let me consider subgroup or exceptional scenarios. Some older or regional guidelines allowed short-course tranexamic acid when there is a significant risk of pre-treatment rebleeding and no contraindication, but this is weak, conditional advice and must be weighed against increased thrombotic and hydrocephalus risks; in modern practice, the pendulum has swung toward avoiding routine antifibrinolytics and prioritizing rapid aneurysm securement instead [^a813d503] [^04f08039] [^66b5335a].

> I should confirm practical alternatives that actually reduce rebleeding. The most effective strategy is early aneurysm treatment, ideally within 24 hours and certainly within 72 hours, with complete obliteration whenever feasible; blood pressure management should avoid extremes and abrupt drops, and anticoagulation should be reversed emergently when present, as these measures directly address modifiable rebleeding risks [^cc6dc9d2] [^9bcb940a] [^9a92dfda].

> Putting this together, I need to be precise. There is no recommended dosage for routine antifibrinolytic therapy to prevent early rebleeding in adults with aneurysmal SAH because high-quality evidence and guidelines recommend against its routine use. If, in exceptional circumstances and local protocols, a clinician elects a short course off-label, the studied regimen is tranexamic acid 1 gram IV load followed by 1 gram IV every 6 hours for no more than 24–72 hours or until aneurysm securement, with the understanding that this does not improve functional outcomes and may increase thrombotic or hydrocephalus complications, so the default should be to avoid it and proceed to definitive aneurysm treatment promptly [^e6261298] [^658ac4a1] [^04f08039] [^160ceed9].

---

Routine antifibrinolytic therapy is **not recommended** for preventing early rebleeding after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage because it does not improve functional outcomes and may increase thrombotic complications [^160ceed9] [^04f08039]. If used selectively in high-risk patients with delayed aneurysm securement, a short course of tranexamic acid (1 g IV every 6 hours for up to 72 hours) may be considered, but this is not standard of care [^a813d503] [^658ac4a1]. Early aneurysm securement remains the most effective strategy to prevent rebleeding [^e14f16e9] [^cc6dc9d2].

---

## Historical rationale and evidence for antifibrinolytic therapy

Antifibrinolytics such as tranexamic acid (TXA) and epsilon-aminocaproic acid (EACA) inhibit fibrinolysis, thereby stabilizing the clot at the aneurysm site and theoretically reducing rebleeding risk [^09afc44f]. Early studies suggested that antifibrinolytics could reduce rebleeding rates, but these benefits were offset by increased risks of delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) and thrombotic complications, leading to no overall improvement in functional outcomes [^fe75eccf] [^a4409a5c].

---

## Contemporary evidence and guidelines

Recent high-quality evidence and guidelines have **shifted practice away from routine antifibrinolytic use**:

- **ULTRA trial**: Ultra-early, short-term TXA (1 g IV every 6 hours for up to 24 hours) did not improve functional outcomes or significantly reduce rebleeding, despite early administration [^e6261298].
- **AHA/ASA 2023 guidelines**: Strongly recommend against routine antifibrinolytic therapy for preventing rebleeding in aSAH patients [^160ceed9] [^04f08039].
- **Neurocritical Care Society 2023 guidelines**: Similarly recommend against antifibrinolytic therapy, citing lack of benefit and potential harm [^04f08039] [^41290f80].

---

## Specific dosing regimens studied

Although routine use is not recommended, the following dosing regimens have been studied:

| **Medication** | **Regimen** | **Duration** | **Evidence level** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Tranexamic acid (TXA) | 1 g IV every 6 hours | Up to 24 hours | ULTRA trial [^e6261298] |
| Tranexamic acid (TXA) | 1 g IV every 6 hours | Up to 72 hours or until aneurysm securement | Historical protocols [^658ac4a1] [^a813d503] |
| Epsilon-aminocaproic acid (EACA) | 4–5 g IV loading dose, then 1 g/hour | Up to 72 hours or until aneurysm securement | Historical protocols [^6bd3b73f] [^228de915] |

---

## Risks and benefits of antifibrinolytic therapy

Benefits include a modest reduction in rebleeding risk, particularly in the ultra-early period, but this does not translate into improved functional outcomes [^e6261298] [^a4409a5c]. Risks include increased incidence of DCI, thrombotic events (DVT, PE), and hydrocephalus, which collectively outweigh the benefits [^fe75eccf] [^66b5335a].

---

## Current standard of care

The cornerstone of preventing early rebleeding is **early aneurysm securement** — surgical clipping or endovascular coiling — ideally within 24–72 hours of presentation [^e14f16e9] [^cc6dc9d2]. Supportive measures include strict blood pressure control, reversal of anticoagulation, and nimodipine administration to prevent delayed cerebral ischemia [^9d5fb72d] [^a42d3443].

---

## Clinical scenarios where antifibrinolytics may be considered

In select cases with high rebleeding risk and delayed aneurysm treatment, a short course of TXA (1 g IV every 6 hours for up to 72 hours) may be considered, but this is **not standard of care** and should be individualized [^a813d503] [^658ac4a1].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Routine antifibrinolytic therapy is **not recommended** for preventing early rebleeding after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage due to lack of benefit and potential harm. Early aneurysm securement remains the most effective strategy. If antifibrinolytics are considered in exceptional cases, a short course of tranexamic acid (1 g IV every 6 hours for up to 72 hours) may be used, but this is not standard practice.

### Antifibrinolytic therapy for aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage [^fe75eccf]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Rebleeding is an important cause of death and disability in people with aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage. Rebleeding is probably related to dissolution of the blood clot at the site of aneurysm rupture by natural fibrinolytic activity. This review is an update of a previously published Cochrane review.

Objectives

To assess the effects of antifibrinolytic treatment in people with aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (February 2013), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 1), MEDLINE (1948 to December 2012), and EMBASE (1947 to December 2012). In an effort to identify further published, unpublished, and ongoing studies we searched reference lists and trial registers, performed forward tracking of relevant references and contacted drug companies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised trials comparing oral or intravenous antifibrinolytic drugs (tranexamic acid, epsilon amino-caproic acid, or an equivalent) with control in people with subarachnoid haemorrhage of suspected or proven aneurysmal cause.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion and extracted the data. Three review authors assessed trial quality. For the primary outcome we converted the outcome scales between good and poor outcome for the analysis. We scored death from any cause and rates of rebleeding, cerebral ischaemia, and hydrocephalus per treatment group. We expressed effects as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We used random-effects models for all analyses.

Main Results

We included 10 trials involving 1904 participants. The risk of bias was low in six studies. Four studies were open label and were rated as high risk of performance bias. One of these studies was also rated as high risk for attrition bias. Four trials reported on poor outcome (death, vegetative state, or severe disability) with a pooled risk ratio (RR) of 1.02 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.91 to 1.15). All trials reported on death from all causes with a pooled RR of 1.00 (95% CI 0.85 to 1.18). In a trial that combined short-term antifibrinolytic treatment (< 72 hours) with preventative measures for cerebral ischaemia the RR for poor outcome was 0.85 (95% CI 0.64 to 1.14). Antifibrinolytic treatment reduced the risk of re-bleeding reported at the end of follow-up (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.97; 78 per 1000 participants), but there was heterogeneity (I² = 62%) between the trials. The pooled RR for reported cerebral ischaemia was 1.41 (95% CI 1.04 to 1.91, 83 per 1000 participants), again with heterogeneity between the trials (I² = 52%). Antifibrinolytic treatment showed no effect on the reported rate of hydrocephalus in five trials (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.36).

Authors' Conclusions

The current evidence does not support the use of antifibrinolytic drugs in the treatment of people with aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage, even in those who have concomitant treatment strategies to prevent cerebral ischaemia. Results on short-term treatment are promising, but not conclusive. Further randomised trials evaluating short-term antifibrinolytic treatment are needed to evaluate its effectiveness.

### Antifibrinolytic therapy to prevent early rebleeding after subarachnoid hemorrhage [^27e2b8a1]. Neurocritical Care (2008). Low credibility.

In the current era of early surgery, there has been little interest in the use of antifibrinolytic therapy to prevent rebleeding after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH). Older studies demonstrated that antifibrinolytics can reduce rebleeding, but long-term therapy results in increased cerebral ischemia from vasospasm, leading to no appreciable effect on mortality. While early surgery would seem to obviate the need for long-term antifibrinolytic use, a subgroup of patients may benefit from early therapy. The rate of pre-operative rebleeding may be as high as 9–17%, causing significant morbidity and mortality. Short-term use of antifibrinolytic agents (less than 3 days) in the presence of calcium channel blocking therapy has shown promising results. A randomized clinical trial of early antifibrinolytic therapy conducted in 2002 showed a significant decrease in rebleeding and a non-significant decrease in overall mortality. In this review, we examine the clinical pharmacology, dosing, monitoring, complications, and side effects of antifibrinolytic treatment. We conclude that early short-term antifibrinolytic therapy might be a reasonable strategy to prevent acute rebleeding and improve long-term outcome in aSAH patients. Additional randomized clinical trials are necessary to determine whether this management strategy is effective.

### Guidelines for the neurocritical care management of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage [^04f08039]. Neurocritical Care (2023). High credibility.

Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage — antifibrinolytic therapy prior to aneurysm treatment — The panel identified six RCTs and six observational studies with 47 different outcome analyses, with all RCTs comparing tranexamic acid (TXA) to placebo. Evidence differentiated long-term administration 'for up to 4 weeks' from short-term 'less than 72 h'. Two RCTs assessed short-term TXA; one reduced ultra-early rebleeding but was underpowered for clinical outcomes, and the largest RCT (ULTRA) concluded that ultra-early, short-term TXA did not improve functional outcome at 6 months and showed no differences in rebleeding, mortality, cerebral ischemia, or thromboembolic events. Consequently, the guideline states: We recommend against the administration of antifibrinolytic therapy to prevent rebleeding of ruptured aneurysms in patients with aSAH (strong recommendation, high-moderate quality of evidence).

### Critical care management of patients following aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage: recommendations from the Neurocritical Care Society's multidisciplinary consensus conference [^6bd3b73f]. Neurocritical Care (2011). Medium credibility.

Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage — prevention of rebleeding, antifibrinolytic use, imaging timing, and blood pressure targets are specified with graded recommendations. Early aneurysm repair should be undertaken, when possible and reasonable, to prevent rebleeding (High Quality Evidence; Strong Recommendation). An early, short course of antifibrinolytic therapy prior to early aneurysm repair (begun at diagnosis; continued up to the point at which the aneurysm is secured or at 72 h post-ictus, whichever is shorter) should be considered (Low Quality Evidence; Weak Recommendation). Delayed (> 48 h after the ictus) or prolonged (> 3 days) antifibrinolytic therapy exposes patients to side effects of therapy when the risk of rebleeding is sharply reduced and should be avoided (High Quality Evidence; Strong Recommendation). Supporting data indicate a uniform reduction in rebleeding rates from ~11 to ~2.5%, and one study noted an increased incidence of DVTs. Rebleeding has been reported when catheter angiography is performed very early (less than 3–6 h) with rates as high as 20–38.5%, yet the authors did not feel that the data available provided a clear basis for attributing an increased rebleeding risk to ultra-early DSA; provisionally, choosing CTA over DSA for ultra-early angiography was a reasonable option where both options are available and there is no case for delaying investigation (either CTA or DSA) to reduce any theoretical risk of rebleeding. Regarding hemodynamics, earlier reports linked events to systolic elevations to 160–200 mmHg, whereas consensus held that modest blood pressure elevation (mean arterial pressure < 110 mmHg; systolic blood pressure < 160 mmHg) was not associated with rebleeding. The panel also states that "Antifibrinolytic therapy is relatively contraindicated in patients with risk factors for thromboembolic".

### Rebleeding after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage [^e49270c8]. Neurocritical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Rebleeding after initial aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) can have substantial impact on overall patient outcome. While older studies have suggested rebleeding occurs in about 4% of patients during the first day after initial aneurysmal bleed, these studies may have failed to capture very early rebleeds and, consequently, underestimated the impact of rebleeding. An electronic literature search was performed to identify English-language articles published or available for review from February 1975 through October 2010. A total of 43 articles (40 original research and 3 review articles) focused on rebleeding after initial aneurysmal SAH in humans were selected for review. Although most studies supported an incidence of rebleeding ≤ 4%, studies investigating ultra-early rebleeding reported bleeding within the first 24 h following aneurysmal SAH in as many as 9–17% of patients, with most cases occurring within 6 h of initial hemorrhage. Overall, studies investigating antifibrinolytic therapy to reduce rebleeding have failed to clearly demonstrate overall therapeutic benefit. Short-course antifibrinolytic therapy may have a role prior to initial aneurysm repair, although insufficient data are currently available.

### Impact of a protocol for acute antifibrinolytic therapy on aneurysm rebleeding after subarachnoid hemorrhage [^228de915]. Stroke (2008). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

epsilon-Aminocaproic acid (EACA) is an antifibrinolytic agent used to prevent rebleeding in aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. Although studies have found that a decrease in rebleeding with long-term antifibrinolytic therapy is offset by an increase in ischemic deficits, more recent studies have indicated that early, short-term therapy may be beneficial.

Methods

We instituted a protocol for acute EACA administration starting at diagnosis and continued for a maximum duration of 72 hours after subarachnoid hemorrhage onset. We compared 73 patients treated with EACA with 175 non-EACA-treated patients. We sought to identify differences in the occurrence of rebleeding, side effects, and outcome.

Results

Baseline characteristics were similar in the 2 groups. There was a significant decrease in rebleeding in EACA-treated patients (2.7%) versus non-EACA patients (11.4%). There was no difference in ischemic complications between cohorts. There was a significant 8-fold increase in deep venous thrombosis in the EACA group but no increase in pulmonary embolism. There was a nonsignificant 76% reduction in mortality attributable to rebleeding, a 13.3% increase in favorable outcome in good-grade EACA-treated patients, and a 6.8% increase in poor-grade patients.

Conclusions

When used acutely, short-term EACA treatment resulted in decreased rebleeding without an increase in serious side effects in our selected group of patients. Randomized placebo-controlled trials are needed to determine whether acute antifibrinolytic therapy should be accepted as the standard of care in all patients.

Rebleeding

Rebleeding after acute rupture of an intracranial aneurysm markedly increases the risk of poor outcome. It occurs in approximately 3–6% of patients within the first 24 h; the risk rapidly declines afterwards. The only effective way to reduce the risk of rebleeding is to secure the ruptured aneurysm quickly.

For this reason, guidelines recommend aneurysm repair by surgical or endovascular means as soon as feasible, preferably within 24 h. Nevertheless, logistical challenges render this goal difficult, and patients should be haemodynamically stable before aneurysm treatment can be safely pursued. Interestingly, studies have found no benefit with repair within 24 h compared to 24–72 h.

The initial instability of the blood clot sealing the defect in the aneurysm is the target of antifibrinolytics. In several initial, randomized-controlled trials, tranexamic acid had been associated with reduced rebleeding, but longer-term use (weeks) was also associated with an increased risk of DCI. However, a recent large, adequately powered randomized controlled trial (RCT) that investigated ultra-early and short-term treatment with tranexamic acid found no difference in outcome, and antifibrinolytic use has since been widely abandoned.

Acute aSAH can be associated with a sympathetic response and rise in blood pressure, aggravating the risk of rebleeding. While intuitive, no high-quality data exist that treatment of hypertension reduces the risk of rebleeding. Additionally, hypotension should also be avoided, as the lack of adequate perfusion of viable brain in the setting of elevated intracranial pressure may lead to acute cerebral ischaemia. The thresholds to lower systolic arterial blood pressure, commonly set at a goal of < 160 mmHg, for these risks are likely unique to each patient and ideally should be individualized in relation to the patient's status and baseline arterial blood pressure values.

### Critical care management of patients following aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage: recommendations from the Neurocritical Care Society's multidisciplinary consensus conference [^f68b539b]. Neurocritical Care (2011). Medium credibility.

Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage — medical measures to prevent rebleeding: Rebleeding incidence is highest immediately after the initial hemorrhage (5–10% over the first 72 h) and is higher with poor-grade SAH, larger aneurysms, sentinel bleeds, and when catheter angiography occurs within 3 h of the ictus. Immediate repair by coil embolization or microsurgical clip ligation markedly reduces the risk of rebleeding, with microsurgical exclusion being slightly more efficacious. Three interventions considered to modulate risk were antifibrinolytic therapy, catheter vs. CT angiography, and blood pressure control. Nine studies of antifibrinolytic therapy prior to 2002 involving 1399 patients showed no benefit on poor outcome or death despite a marked significant reduction in rebleeding, with therapy often continued for weeks and at least one study initiating as late as 4 days post-ictus.

Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) medical measures to prevent rebleeding include the following: in patients with aSAH and unsecured aneurysm, frequent blood pressure monitoring and blood pressure control with short-acting medication(s) is recommended to avoid severe hypotension, hypertension, and blood pressure variability; in patients with aSAH who are receiving anticoagulants, emergency anticoagulation reversal with appropriate reversal agents should be performed to prevent rebleeding; and in patients with aSAH, routine use of antifibrinolytic therapy is not useful to improve functional outcome.

EARLY VERSUS LATE INTERVENTION?

Early therapy with either surgical clipping or neuroradiologic intervention with endovascular coiling will prevent rebleeding and will enable safe and effective management of vasospasm. However, early surgery on an edematous brain makes the surgical task difficult. In the past, early intervention was advocated for better neurological grades, now surgical intervention is done for higher grades as well. An 11-year database of 230 consecutive ruptured aneurysms from an Australian center found that either early surgical clipping or endovascular coiling within 24 hours was associated with improved clinical outcome. Another meta-analysis also found that early intervention within 72 hours is associated with improved clinical outcome and that the degree of improvement is a function of the clinical condition on admission. An observational study from the Netherlands involving 8 centers and 1500 patients did not show a difference in outcome with either early or late intervention to secure the aneurysm, in good grade patients. However, patients with poor neurological grades at admission fared better with early intervention. An analysis of data from a Nationwide Inpatient Sample on 32,048 US patients with aSAH from 2005 to 2008 revealed that patients treated early (within 48 h of hospital admission) with coiling or surgery are more likely to be discharged with little or no disability.

Whenever a delay is anticipated in definitive treatment, a short course (< 72 h) of antifibrinolytic agents such as tranexemic acid and aminocaprionic acid prevents rebleeding without increasing the risk for DCI. However, delayed and prolonged therapy with antifibrinolytic agents is not recommended, as it may increase the risk for thrombotic events and DCI. The role of antifibrinolytic agents in terms of overall patient outcome is yet to be demonstrated in RCTs.

### Immediate administration of tranexamic acid and reduced incidence of early rebleeding after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage: a prospective randomized study [^658ac4a1]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2002). Low credibility.

Object

By pursuing a policy of very early aneurysm treatment in neurosurgical centers, in-hospital rebleeds can be virtually eliminated. Nonetheless, as many as 15% of patients with aneurysm rupture suffer ultraearly rebleeding with high mortality rates, and these individuals are beyond the reach of even the most ambitious protocol for diagnosis and referral. Only drugs given immediately after the diagnosis of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) has been established at the local hospital level can, in theory, contribute to the minimization of such ultraearly rebleeding. The object of this randomized, prospective, multicenter study was to assess the efficacy of short-term antifibrinolytic treatment with tranexamic acid in preventing rebleeding.

Methods

Only patients suffering SAH verified on computerized tomography (CT) scans within 48 hours prior to the first hospital admission were included. A 1-g dose of tranexamic acid was given intravenously as soon as diagnosis of SAH had been verified in the local hospitals (before the patients were transported), followed by doses of 1 g every 6 hours until the aneurysm was occluded; this treatment did not exceed 72 hours. In this study, 254 patients received tranexamic acid and 251 patients were randomized as controls. Age, sex, Hunt and Hess and Fisher grade distributions, as well as aneurysm locations, were congruent between the groups. Outcome was assessed at 6 months post-SAH by using the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS). Vasospasm and delayed ischemic neurological deficits were classified according to clinical findings as well as by transcranial Doppler (TCD) studies. All events classified as rebleeding were verified on CT scans or during surgery.

Conclusions

More than 90% of patients reached the neurosurgical center within 12 hours of their first hospital admission after SAH; 70% of all aneurysms were clipped or coils were inserted within 24 hours of the first hospital admission. Given the protocol, only one rebleed occurred later than 24 hours after the first hospital admission. Despite this strong emphasis on early intervention, however, a cluster of 27 very early rebleeds still occurred in the control group within hours of randomization into the study, and 13 of these patients died. In the tranexamic acid group, six patients rebled and two died. A reduction in the rebleeding rate from 10.8 to 2.4% and an 80% reduction in the mortality rate from early rebleeding with tranexamic acid treatment can therefore be inferred. Favorable outcome according to the GOS increased from 70.5 to 74.8%. According to TCD measurements and clinical findings, there were no indications of increased risk of either ischemic clinical manifestations or vasospasm that could be linked to tranexamic acid treatment. Neurosurgical guidelines for aneurysm rupture should extend also into the preneurosurgical phase to guarantee protection from ultraearly rebleeds. Currently available antifibrinolytic drugs can provide such protection, and at low cost. The number of potentially saved lives exceeds those lost to vasospasm.

Rebleeding and haemostasis treatment

Due to the high risk of rebleeding during the first 2 weeks post-SAH, early prevention of rebleeding is important for a better clinical outcome. For patients with SAH, endovascular treatments, such as aneurysm clipping as well as hybrid operation, are preferred since the risk of rebleeding may be reduced. Medical treatment is preferred for patients with severe SAH who do not have an aneurysm or with contraindication to intervention.

Recommendations

For most patients with SAH with a ruptured aneurysm, endovascular or surgical treatment should be considered as soon as possible (less than 72 hours) in order to reduce the risk of rebleeding (class I, level of evidence B).
The interventional or surgical treatment plan should be discussed and determined by the multidisciplinary team, experienced neurosurgeons and neurointerventionalists (class I, level of Evidence C).
For patients with an aneurysm suitable for either interventional or microsurgical treatment, interventional therapy is preferred (class I, level of evidence A). For patients with SAH older than 70 and with a Hunt-Hess Scale score between 4 and 5, endovascular treatment is preferred (class IIa, level of evidence B).
Antifibrinolytic drugs may help reduce the risk of rebleeding after SAH in a short term, but these are unable to improve the long-term clinical outcomes. If the patient still has a significant risk of rebleeding before intervention and there is no absolute contraindication, tranexamic acid can be used for a short term (< 72 hours) (class IIb, level of evidence B). However, it should not be used in patients during postsurgical or endovascular therapy (class III, level of evidence C).

### Impact of time to start of tranexamic acid treatment on rebleed risk and outcome in aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage [^4e7770a8]. European Stroke Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction:

The ULTRA-trial investigated effectiveness of ultra-early administration of tranexamic acid (TXA) in subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and showed that TXA reduces the risk of rebleeding without concurrent improvement in clinical outcome. Previous trials in bleeding conditions, distinct from SAH, have shown that time to start of antifibrinolytic treatment influences outcome. This post-hoc analysis of the ULTRA-trial investigates whether the interval between hemorrhage and start of TXA impacts the effect of TXA on rebleeding and functional outcome following aneurysmal SAH.

Patients and methods:

A post-hoc comparative analysis was conducted between aneurysmal SAH patients of the ULTRA-trial, receiving TXA and usual care to those receiving usual care only. We assessed confounders, hazard ratio (HR) of rebleeding and odds ratio (OR) of good outcome (modified Rankin Scale 0–3) at 6 months, and investigated the impact of time between hemorrhage and start of TXA on the treatment effect, stratified into time categories (0–3, 3–6 and > 6 h).

Results:

Sixty-four of 394 patients (16.2%) in the TXA group experienced a rebleeding, compared to 83 of 413 patients (19.9%) with usual care only (HR 0.86, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.62–1.19). Time to start of TXA modifies the effect of TXA on rebleeding rate (p < 0.001), with a clinically non-relevant reduction observed only when TXA was initiated after 6 h (absolute rate reduction 1.4%). Tranexamic acid treatment showed no effect on good outcome (OR 0.96, 95% CI: 0.72–1.27) with no evidence of effect modification on the time to start of TXA (p = 0.53).

Discussion and conclusions:

This study suggests that the effect of TXA on rebleeding is modified by time to treatment, providing a protective, albeit clinically non-relevant, effect only when started after 6 h. No difference in functional outcome was seen. Routine TXA treatment in the aneurysmal SAH population, even within a specified time frame, is not recommended to improve functional outcome.

Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage — antifibrinolytic therapy, imaging selection, and blood pressure management are directed as follows: Patients treated with antifibrinolytic therapy should have close screening for deep venous thrombosis (Moderate Quality Evidence; Strong Recommendation). Antifibrinolytic therapy should be discontinued 2 h before planned endovascular ablation of an aneurysm (Very Low Quality Evidence; Weak Recommendation). When CTA and DSA are both available and CTA is of high technical quality, CTA should be performed preferentially if endovascular intervention is not planned at the time of angiography (Very Low Quality Evidence; Weak Recommendation). Treat extreme hypertension in patients with an unsecured, recently ruptured aneurysm. Modest elevations in blood pressure (mean blood pressure < 110 mmHg) do not require therapy. Pre-morbid baseline blood pressures should be used to refine targets; hypotension should be avoided (Low Quality Evidence; Strong Recommendation).

Management of aneurysm

Definitive treatment hinges on early securement of the aneurysm, within 72 h or ideally within 48 h of diagnosis. Most rebleeding happens within the first 24 h, so early securement (within 24 h) may be safe. The securement method depends on many factors, particularly the patient's age, morphology and location of the aneurysm, and presence of intraparenchymal haemorrhage. Following the international subarachnoid aneurysm trial (ISAT), coiling is preferred as it is associated with improved mortality and functional outcomes, with a marginally higher rate of aneurysm recurrence –. The choice of securement method should be made after a multidisciplinary team discussion between the interventional radiologists, neurosurgeons, and neurocritical specialists. Tranexamic acid may reduce rebleeding and improve overall mortality –. Current guidelines recommend a short course of antifibrinolytic agent and discontinuing after securing the aneurysm, a maximum of 72 h of tranexamic acid. Prolonged use of antifibrinolytics increases the risk of thrombotic events and DCI.

Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) neurocritical care guidelines — scope and methods state that clinical questions were developed in a Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcomes (PICO) format and prioritized by consensus, were developed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach, and address nine specific topics: Blood pressure management for the prevention of rebleeding; use of antifibrinolytics for the prevention of rebleeding; pharmacological interventions including calcium channel blockers, endothelin antagonists, statins, and high dose magnesium; fluid administration; hemodynamic management; triggers for intervention in patients with delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI); management of hyponatremia; management of anemia; and management of hydrocephalus. The panel selected nine PICO questions relevant to the management of aSAH in the immediate postbleeding phase prior to aneurysm securing and to the management after the aneurysm is secured. These guidelines do not apply to pediatric populations or to patients with nonaneurysmal SAH.

Implementation issues

All studies used similar dosing to CRASH-2, with 1 g IV TXA loading dose followed by an infusion of 1 g IV maintenance infusion over a longer period of time. Some patients with TBI have other associated traumatic injuries; this recommendation supports the use of TXA in trauma with or without TBI, while the severity and nature of injuries is being assessed. As in the general trauma population, there is a suggestion that if TXA is given, it is most likely to be effective when given early, within 3 h although the prehospital may not be more effective. While some centers may use viscoelastic testing to guide interventions, early empiric use of TXA may still be beneficial, as point of care results may not be sensitive for hyperfibrinolysis.

Evidence summary

A number of trials have evaluated anti-fibrinolytic therapies in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), 10 of which evaluated IV TXA. These studies demonstrated no change in mortality (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.88–1.16; RD − 0.3%, 95% CI − 3.2 to 4.2%, moderate certainty) or poor functional outcome (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.95–1.15; RD − 0.4%, 95% CI − 1.9 to 5.8, low certainty), but a reduced risk of rebleeding (RR 0.6, 95% CI 0.44–0.8; RD − 7.8%, 95% CI − 11 to − 3.9, moderate certainty), offset by an increased risk of stroke (RR 1.29, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.67; RD 6.1%, 0.2% to 14.1%, low certainty). Only the recent ULTRA trial reported rates of venous thrombosis, which were rare but similar between groups. Most trials were several decades old, with only the three most recent trials evaluated TXA within clinical context with the use of calcium channel blockers and endovascular coiling of aneurysms, though results appear generally consistent between older and newer trials.

### Ultra-early and short-term tranexamic acid treatment in patients with good-and poor-grade aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage [^3c145423]. Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) is a devastating disease with high morbidity and mortality. The occurrence of rebleeding is one of the most important factors associated with poor outcome. Risk factors of rebleeding include poor neurologic condition on admission, large aneurysm size, and elevated systolic blood pressure. In the past, antifibrinolytics have been shown to decrease the occurrence of rebleeding; however, a positive effect on clinical outcome could not be established. The ULTRA trial investigated ultra-early and short-term tranexamic acid (TXA) administration after SAH. The trial was designed to end the decade-long debate on the efficacy of antifibrinolytics on clinical outcome after SAH. The recently published results of the ULTRA trial showed no clinical benefit of TXA after 6 months. Moreover, patients in the TXA group less often had excellent clinical outcome compared with those in the usual care group. This has led to significant alterations in international guidelines on the management of SAH, which now advise against the routine use of TXA.

Hypothetically, the lack of overall effect of TXA in all patients with SAH may be explained by different effects of TXA in certain subgroups, for example, patients with good and poor neurologic condition on admission. Early brain injury is defined as the initial injury in the first 72 hours after aSAH. The pathophysiology of early brain injury includes the formation of microthrombi. Theoretically, reduced degradation of microthrombi by TXA may delay or hinder recovery of early brain injury and, thereby, might have a negative effect on clinical outcome. Because patients with poor-grade aSAH have more severe early brain injury, especially these patients may be negatively influenced by administration of TXA. Because the detrimental impact of rebleedings in patients with good-grade aSAH is generally much larger than in patients who are already in a poor condition, one may expect a beneficial effect of TXA on clinical outcome in good-grade patients. Therefore, the primary research question in this post hoc subgroup analysis of the ULTRA trial is as follows: does ultra-early and short-term TXA treatment improve clinical outcome at 6 months in patients with good-grade and poor-grade aSAH?

### Emergency medical management of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage [^e6261298]. Neurocritical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

In 1984, it was shown that long-term administration of tranexamic acid (given up to 4 weeks until aneurysm treatment) reduced the risk of rebleeding but did not improve functional outcome. Although tranexamic acid reduced the incidence of rebleeding, there was no effect on functional outcome, which was explained by a higher incidence of ischemic complications. A new randomized trial was designed after oral nimodipine and maintenance of normovolemia became standard treatment to reduce the risk of DCI. The STAR trial, which was published in 2000, showed that long-term tranexamic acid reduced the risk of rebleeding without increasing the risk of DCI. However, once again no effect on functional outcome was observed. Meanwhile, timing of aneurysm treatment started to shift from postponed treatment (often more than 14 days after ictus) toward treatment within 3 days. Therefore, a new randomized trial investigated the effect of short-term (< 72 h) treatment with tranexamic acid. The results showed that short-term treatment reduced the incidence of rebleeding without increasing the risk of DCI and was associated with a trend toward improved functional outcome. Unfortunately, that trial was not powered to show any effect on functional outcome. More recently, the ULtra-early TRranexamic Acid after Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (ULTRA) trial investigated the effect of short-term (< 24 h) treatment with tranexamic acid with treatment initiation directly after computed tomography confirmed a diagnosis of SAH in the initial hospital and was powered to detect differences in functional outcome. The median time between ictus and treatment initiation was 185 min. Rebleeding after randomization and before aneurysm treatment occurred in 49 (10%) patients in the tranexamic acid and in 66 (14%) patients in the control group (odds ratio 0.71, 95% confidence interval 0.48–1.04). Good functional outcome was observed in 287 (60%) of 475 patients in the tranexamic acid group and 300 (64%) of 470 patients in the control group (treatment center adjusted odds ratio 0.86, 95% confidence interval 0.66–1.12). The ULtra-early TRranexamic Acid after Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (ULTRA) trial provided convincing evidence that even very early and very short lasting antifibrinolytic therapy does not eliminate the risk of early rebleeding and does not improve functional outcome in patients with aSAH. An updated Cochrane review on this subject concluded that the current evidence does not support the routine use of antifibrinolytic drugs in patients with aSAH. The recent Neurocritical Care Society guideline also recommends against the administration of antifibrinolytic therapy to prevent rebleeding of ruptured aneurysms in patients with aSAH.

Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage — obliteration strategy and staged management: The risks of both rebleeding and retreatment are substantially higher with incomplete obliteration of a ruptured aneurysm; therefore, the goal of initial treatment is complete obliteration whenever feasible. For patients in whom complete obliteration is not feasible by clipping or primary coiling during the initial treatment, partial treatment aimed at securing the putative rupture site during the acute phase is reasonable to reduce early rebleeding, and retreatment, typically within 1 to 3 months, is advisable to prevent future rebleeding.

### Time intervals from subarachnoid hemorrhage to rebleed [^952c3e26]. Journal of Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

The most threatening early complication and predictor of poor outcome after an aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) is a rebleed. To evaluate what proportion of rebleeds might be prevented by early treatment, we assessed the time interval from the initial hemorrhage to rebleed, and the location of the patient at the time of rebleed. Patient characteristics, World Federation of Neurological Surgeons grade on admission and modified Rankin Scale outcome scores, referring hospitals and time intervals from initial hemorrhage to treatment of 293 patients treated between 2008 and 2011 were evaluated. Time intervals to rebleeds and location of the patients at the time of rebleed were retrieved. Rebleeds were confirmed by CT in 12% of patients, and an additional 4% of patients was diagnosed as having a possible rebleed. Sixty percent of rebleeds occurred after admission to the treatment center. Almost all rebleeds occurred within 24 h, with a median time interval between initial hemorrhage and rebleed of 180 min. A significantly shorter time to treatment and a higher mortality were seen in the group of patients with a rebleed. Approximately, one in six patients with an aSAH had a rebleed, of which a majority might have been preventable because they occurred after admission to the treatment center. A reduction in the rebleed rate seems feasible by securing the aneurysm as soon as possible by improving in-hospital logistics for early aneurysm treatment. Alternative options, such as immediate administration of antifibrinolytics, are being explored in a multicenter trial.

### Impact of time to start of tranexamic acid treatment on rebleed risk and outcome in aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage [^d016e713]. European Stroke Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Further investigation of known risk factors, such as hypertension in the first hours after the hemorrhage, early surgery for cerebrospinal fluid drainage or emergency aneurysm treatment within 6 h, is therefore warranted to achieve a reduction of the very early rebleeds. Unfortunately, most of these data were not collected in the ULTRA-trial, so this hypothesis cannot be investigated.

The failure of showing a positive effect of TXA treatment on outcome has been confirmed consistently by several moderate to high quality randomized controlled trials spanning almost 50 years, in several countries and even with optimized treatment protocols. This supports the reliability and generalizability of the conclusion of the current study to the complete aSAH population.

Although our analysis suggests that TXA reduces rebleeding if administered later than 6 h after the initial hemorrhage, the absolute number of rebleedings in this time category is low. This low number of rebleeds together with the post-hoc analysis and multiple testing could have caused a statistically significant finding which is a results of chance, instead of a real effect. Moreover, with this low number of rebleeds after 6 h, the protective effect of TXA treatment is applied to a proportion too small to have a significant impact on the overall rebleed rate and functional outcome. This potential protective effect after 6 h contrasts with studies on other bleeding conditions, which showed only a protective effect of TXA treatment when given within 3 h. One explanation lies in the differences among underlying pathophysiologies. The goal of TXA treatment in aSAH patients is to stabilize the blood clot to prevent a single devastating rebleeding, while in other indications it primarily delays continuous bleeding. It appears that there are risk factors exerting a stronger effect on rebleeds in the first hours in aSAH than TXA can effectively prevent. Consequently, it is crucial to investigate other risk factors for rebleeds, and treatment protocols should be adjusted, particularly to reduce the rebleeds within the first 6 h after the initial hemorrhage.

### Short-term antifibrinolytic therapy before early aneurysm treatment in subarachnoid hemorrhage: effects on rehemorrhage, cerebral ischemia, and hydrocephalus [^9d1030ef]. Neurosurgery (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Long-term administration of the antifibrinolytic agent epsilon aminocaproic acid (EACA) reduces the rate of rehemorrhage in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), but is associated with cerebral ischemia.

Objective

To evaluate short-term administration of EACA before early surgery in patients with SAH.

Methods

Retrospective review of 356 patients admitted between June 2002 and December 2007 with a diagnosis of aneurysmal SAH. Medical records were reviewed to determine SAH risk factors, clinical grade at the time of admission, and incidence of rehemorrhage, permanent new-onset focal neurological deficits, computed tomography evidence of cerebral infarction, symptomatic vasospasm, and hydrocephalus.

Results

Patients underwent treatment of the ruptured aneurysm an average of 47.4 hours after admission and received an average total dose of 40.6 g of EACA. The mean length of time of administration of EACA was 35.6 hours. There was a total of 5 rehemorrhages, for an overall rebleeding rate of 1.4% and a rate of rehemorrhage per 24-hour period of 0.71%. Overall, the rates of symptomatic vasospasm and permanent neurological deficits attributable to ischemic stroke were 11.5% and 7.2%, respectively, and the incidence of shunt-dependent hydrocephalus was 42.3%. Patients who were treated with coiling had higher rates of symptomatic vasospasm and ischemic complications than patients who had surgery.

Conclusion

Short-term administration of EACA is associated with rates of rehemorrhage, ischemic stroke, and symptomatic vasospasm that compare favorably with historical controls. The rate of hydrocephalus is relatively high and may be attributable to EACA treatment.

### Subarachnoid haemorrhage: diagnosis, causes and management [^3239742d]. Brain (2001). Low credibility.

The incidence of subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) is stable, at around six cases per 100 000 patient years. Any apparent decrease is attributable to a higher rate of CT scanning, by which other haemorrhagic conditions are excluded. Most patients are < 60 years of age. Risk factors are the same as for stroke in general; genetic factors operate in only a minority. Case fatality is approximately 50% overall (including pre-hospital deaths) and one-third of survivors remain dependent. Sudden, explosive headache is a cardinal but non-specific feature in the diagnosis of SAH: in general practice, the cause is innocuous in nine out of 10 patients in whom this is the only symptom. CT scanning is mandatory in all, to be followed by (delayed) lumbar puncture if CT is negative. The cause of SAH is a ruptured aneurysm in 85% of cases, non-aneurysmal perimesencephalic haemorrhage (with excellent prognosis) in 10%, and a variety of rare conditions in 5%. Catheter angiography for detecting aneurysms is gradually being replaced by CT angiography. A poor clinical condition on admission may be caused by a remediable complication of the initial bleed or a recurrent haemorrhage in the form of intracranial haematoma, acute hydrocephalus or global brain ischaemia. Occlusion of the aneurysm effectively prevents rebleeding, but there is a dearth of controlled trials assessing the relative benefits of early operation (within 3 days) versus late operation (day 10–12), or that of endovascular treatment versus any operation. Antifibrinolytic drugs reduce the risk of rebleeding, but do not improve overall outcome. Measures of proven value in decreasing the risk of delayed cerebral ischaemia are a liberal supply of fluids, avoidance of antihypertensive drugs and administration of nimodipine. Once ischaemia has occurred, treatment regimens such as a combination of induced hypertension and hypervolaemia, or transluminal angioplasty, are plausible, but of unproven benefit.

### Ultra-early and short-term tranexamic acid treatment in patients with good-and poor-grade aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage [^66b5335a]. Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Evaluation of common complications following aSAH in patients with good-grade aSAH revealed a higher occurrence of hydrocephalus in the TXA group. The mechanism of action of TXA is to prevent rebleeding by reducing blood clot breakdown. Hypothetically, a reduction of blood clot breakdown in the subarachnoid space may impede absorption of the CSF and, as a consequence, may lead to hydrocephalus. In 2022, a systematic review with meta-analyses, including the ULTRA trial and 6 other randomized controlled trials, showed a significantly 13% higher pooled incidence of hydrocephalus in patients with SAH treated with TXA compared with that in controls. On the contrary, a 2022 Cochrane review, including the ULTRA trial and 5 other randomized controlled trials, showed a RR of 1.09, 95% CI 0.9 to 1.20 for hydrocephalus in patients treated with antifibrinolytic treatment vs controls. Whether the observed higher occurrence of hydrocephalus in patients with good-grade aSAH using TXA is clinically relevant cannot be concluded based on our results. In patients with poor-grade aSAH, the incidence of hydrocephalus is known to be high already (in ULTRA participants with aSAH: 64% in the TXA group and 59% in the usual care group; in patients with poor-grade aSAH: 69% in the TXA and 72% in the usual care group). The relatively high incidence of hydrocephalus in patients with poor-grade aSAH could mask an additional harmful effect of tranexamic acid.

### Impact of time to start of tranexamic acid treatment on rebleed risk and outcome in aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage [^0ca3ba5f]. European Stroke Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

This study's strengths lie in its trial design, with randomization between groups, strict outcome definitions assessed with minimal bias, and the highly precise estimation of the times of randomization and the occurrence of the rebleeding.

The equal distribution of all baseline and time interval variables across groups indicate a low risk for confounding, which may also be extrapolated to unmeasured variables. The low amount of missing data, evenly distributed among groups, mitigated the risk of selection bias. However, a notably high proportion of deaths among the missing data on aneurysm location was observed. This can be attributed to the severity of the initial hemorrhage leading to reduced brain perfusion and making it difficult to ascertain the exact location of the aneurysm.

A notable weakness of this study is its post hoc analysis, resulting in low statistical power. The effect estimates are imprecise with wide confidence intervals. In a strict sense, the results serve as a basis for generating hypotheses and should be interpreted with care regarding the implementation in daily practice. The calculation of estimated times, applicable in 10% of the instances of time of initial hemorrhage, could have introduced information bias. We used strict definitions for calculating the time of the initial hemorrhage, with a maximum imprecision of 3 h in either direction. Assuming to result in non-differential misclassification, this issue likely had a minor impact on the overall results, except for a dilution of the treatment effect. Additionally, the creation of the three time interval groups may have introduced some misclassification. Given the anticipated higher information bias associated with continuous parameters, the decision to analyze in time groups is considered a suitable solution.

### Management of patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage [^5938b0d3]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Outcome of patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage (ASAH) has improved, but is still poor. After the introduction of endovascular treatment of intracranial aneurysms, much attention has been given to indications for and advances in endovascular and microneurosurgical techniques to occlude aneurysms, but management of patients with ASAH encompasses much more than occluding the aneurysm.

Recent Findings

This review describes recent advances in diagnosis and general management of ASAH and in knowledge and medical treatment of delayed cerebral ischaemia and rebleeding.

Summary

In patients with a head computed tomography scan performed less than 6h after headache onset and reported negative by a staff radiologist, lumbar puncture can be withheld. Patients with ASAH should preferably be treated in a tertiary care centre that treats more than 100 ASAH patients per year. Currently, the only treatment strategy to reduce the risk of delayed cerebral ischaemia remains nimodipine; there is no place for statins or magnesium sulphate, nor for lumbar drainage. Hypervolaemia and induced hypertension may be less beneficial than presumed, and further trials are urgently needed. Very early and short treatment with antifibrinolytic drugs may also be beneficial, but data from ongoing trials should be awaited before this treatment strategy can be implemented.

Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage — timing of aneurysm treatment: Early treatment of ruptured aneurysms reduces the risk of rebleeding and facilitates treatment of delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI); in the only randomized trial in the precoiling era of good-grade aSAH, early surgery (0–3 days from SAH) lowered death and dependency at 3 months versus intermediate early surgery (4–7 days) or late surgery (≥ 8 days). Observational data have defined early treatment as within 24, 48, or 72 hours from onset of SAH, and show a beneficial effect of treatment < 24 hours versus > 24 hours, without a significant difference between < 24 hours and 24 to 72 hours. Studies also support treatment in the intermediate time frame (4–7 days) rather than delaying beyond 7 to 10 days, indicating that treatment should not be postponed beyond the typical DCI period in patients presenting during that time frame.

Justification

The panel did not make a recommendation regarding the use of TXA in SAH. The effects of TXA appear mixed, with a decreased risk of rebleeding, and a similar magnitude of increased stroke (both of which are themselves of uncertain clinical relevance in the context of these older studies in which diagnostic procedures may vary). Overall, there appears to be little impact upon mortality and the risk of poor functional outcome, although the evidence is insufficiently precise to rule out a clinically meaningful effect. The panel judged the available evidence as insufficient to make a recommendation, as the values and preferences of patients and clinicians regarding the risk of rebleeding vs. stroke may vary, such as when securement of aneurysm may be delayed.

Implementation issues

Given the uncertainty of the evidence and variations in local practice, decisions around the use of TXA in the population need be based upon individual factors, such as clinician concerns around risk of stroke vs. rebleeding, and time until definitive securement of aneurysm. Widespread use of TXA in this setting should await further evidence.

TXA in patients with non-traumatic intracranial hemorrhage.

Evidence summary

Three RCTs have evaluated IV TXA in non-traumatic ICH, the majority of data from the large TICH-2 trial which evaluated IV TXA in the acute phase of patients with ICH. These studies demonstrate no change in mortality (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.88–1.19; RD 0.4%, 95% CI − 2.5 to 4, moderate certainty), poor functional outcome (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.93–1.04; RD − 1.4%, 95% CI − 4.9 to 2.8; moderate certainty). Other outcomes, including stroke, myocardial infarction, venous thromboembolism, seizure, and length of stay were also similar, although certainty was only moderate for all outcomes, limited my imprecision.

Justification

While the quality of evidence for critical outcomes was moderate, the point effect and confidence intervals for TXA did not indicate either benefit or harm in patients with ICH. There is thus moderate evidence of no effect, but the use or non-use of TXA in this setting would be reasonable pending further evidence. The panel thus chose to make no recommendation for or against the use of TXA compared to no TXA in this setting.

Surgical and endovascular treatment for ruptured cerebral aneurysms — timing and treatment goal: For patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH), surgical or endovascular treatment of the ruptured aneurysm should be performed as early as feasible after presentation, preferably within 24 hours of onset, to improve outcome (1 B-NR). For patients with aSAH, complete obliteration of the ruptured aneurysm is indicated whenever feasible to reduce the risk of rebleeding and retreatment (1 B-NR).

Anticoagulation reversal in aSAH is addressed as follows: the benefit of emergency reversal has not been tested in patients presenting with aSAH, yet the value of immediate anticoagulation reversal has been demonstrated in other forms of intracranial hemorrhage; consequently, immediate anticoagulation reversal in any patient presenting with aSAH is strongly recommended, and reversal strategies should follow current published standards for life-threatening bleeding. In patients taking anticoagulants, clinical judgment supports emergency reversal of anticoagulation, even if the value of this intervention has not been studied in patients presenting with aSAH.

### Antiplatelet therapy for aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage [^f7cbff9b]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Secondary ischaemia is a frequent cause of poor outcome in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH). Besides vasospasm, platelet aggregation seems to play a role in the pathogenesis of secondary ischaemia. Experimental studies have suggested that antiplatelet agents can prevent secondary ischaemia.

Objectives

To determine whether antiplatelet agents change outcome in patients with aneurysmal SAH.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (last searched August 2006), MEDLINE (1966 to August 2006) and EMBASE databases (1980 to August 2006). We also searched reference lists of identified trials.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing any antiplatelet agent with control in patients with aneurysmal SAH.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted the data and assessed trial quality. Relative risks (RR) were calculated with regard to poor outcome, case fatality, secondary ischaemia, haemorrhagic intracranial complications and aneurysmal rebleeding according to the intention-to-treat principle. In case of a statistically significant primary analysis, a worst case analysis was performed.

Main Results

Seven RCTs were included in the review, totalling 1385 patients. Four of these trials met the criteria for good quality studies. For any antiplatelet agent there were reductions of a poor outcome (RR 0.79, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.62 to 1.01) and secondary brain ischaemia (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.22) and more intracranial haemorrhagic complications (RR 1.36, 95% CI 0.59 to 3.12), but none of these differences were statistically significant. There was no effect on case fatality (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.37) or aneurysmal rebleeding (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.38). For individual antiplatelet agents, only ticlopidine was associated with statistically significant fewer occurrences of a poor outcome (RR 0.37, 95% CI 95% CI 0.14 to 0.98) but this estimate was based on only one small RCT.

Authors' Conclusions

This review shows a trend towards better outcome in patients treated with antiplatelet agents, possibly due to a reduction in secondary ischaemia. However, results were not statistically significant, thus no definite conclusions can be drawn. Also, antiplatelet agents could increase the risk of haemorrhagic complications. On the basis of the current evidence treatment with antiplatelet agents in order to prevent secondary ischaemia or poor outcome cannot be recommended.

Current Management Considerations and Suggested Practice Guidance

The authors' practice is as follows (Table 1):
No antifibrinolytic drugs or corticosteroids.
Upper blood pressure limits are based on individual factors. In general, we accept any systolic blood pressure after treatment of the aneurysm. In elderly patients, those with a history of cardiac disease, or those without hypertension prior to ictus, a blood pressure cutoff can be considered (for example systolic blood pressure below 220 mm Hg). If it is decided to give blood pressure lowering drugs, we prefer continuous infusion of short-acting drugs, such as labetalol. Diuretic drugs should be avoided to maintain normovolemia. Care should be taken that the blood pressure reduction will be gradual (maximum mean arterial pressure reduction of 10% in 2 h) to decrease the risk of DCI.
Nimodipine 60 mg every 4 h.
Antiepileptic drugs only after documented seizure is not related to (re)bleeding.
Insulin therapy if fasting glucose > 10 mml/L, and regular glucose control with oral antidiabetic drugs and/or insulin therapy in patients with diabetes.
Treatment of acute hydrocephalus with one or more lumbar punctures. We pursue external ventricular drainage only in case of complete filling of the third or fourth ventricle with blood if repeated lumbar punctures are not effective in restoring consciousness. External ventricular drainage is also applied if the neurosurgeon wants to decrease intracranial pressure prior to clipping of the ruptured aneurysm.

Although irregular shape of the aneurysm is an independent risk factor for early rebleeding, we need additional risk factors for aneurysm treatment prioritisation, since two-thirds of the patients without rebleeding also has an irregular aneurysm. To identify the optimal candidates for ultra-early aneurysm treatment, larger studies are needed to develop risk prediction models to determine absolute risks for early rebleeding and risks of complications of ultra-early treatment.

American Heart Association/American Stroke Association aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage guideline — aim, methods, and scope are outlined: The "2023 Guideline for the Management of Patients With Aneurysmal Subarachnoid Hemorrhage" replaces the 2012 "Guidelines for the Management of Aneurysmal Subarachnoid Hemorrhage" and is intended to provide patient-centric recommendations for clinicians to prevent, diagnose, and manage patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. Literature review methods specify a comprehensive search derived from research principally involving human subjects, published in English, and indexed in MEDLINE, PubMed, Cochrane Library, and other selected databases relevant to this guideline that was conducted between March 2022 and June 2022, and the writing group reviewed documents on related subject matter previously published by the American Heart Association. New studies published between July 2022 and November 2022 that affected recommendation content, Class of Recommendation, or Level of Evidence were included if appropriate. The guideline provides recommendations based on current evidence and presents an evidence-based approach to preventing, diagnosing, and managing patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage, updating many prior recommendations and creating new ones when supported by published data.

### The critical care management of poor-grade subarachnoid haemorrhage [^f2d40883]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

The results from an ongoing trial only enrolling patients with poor-grade SAH may help answer the question of whether early treatment (within 3 days) is associated with improved outcome compared with intermediate (days 4–7) or late (after day 7) treatment.

The choice of treatment modality between surgical clipping and endovascular coiling is a complex endeavour, which requires the expertise of an interdisciplinary team, including neurointensivists, interventional neuroradiologists and neurovascular surgeons. For aneurysms considered to be equally treatable by both modalities, the endovascular approach is superior, being associated with better long-term outcomes. Randomised trials of clipping versus coiling included mostly good-grade patients, leading to controversy as to whether their results apply also to poor-grade patients. Retrospective data on clipping and coiling in poor-grade patients seem to suggest that surgical clipping and endovascular are equally effective. An early and short course of an anti-fibrinolytic drug such as tranexamic acid, initiated as soon as the radiological diagnosis of SAH is established and stopped within 24–72 hours, has been associated with decreased rate of ultra-early re-bleeding and a non-significant improvement in long-term functional outcome. This approach remains controversial, and short-term administration of tranexamic acid to prevent re-bleeding is being further studied in a multicentre randomised trial (Dutch Trial Registry number NTR3272). Another medical intervention applied to prevent aneurysm re-rupture is the avoidance of extremes of blood pressure. The American Heart Association/American Stroke Association and the Neurocritical Care guidelines suggest keeping the mean arterial blood pressure below 110 mm Hg or systolic blood pressure below 160 mm Hg (or both) in the presence of ruptured unsecured aneurysm. The European guidelines are less aggressive and suggest keeping the systolic blood pressure below 180 mm Hg. These parameters should not be used after aneurysm treatment, when spontaneously high blood pressure may be beneficial.

### Early versus delayed mobilisation for aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage [^dd0786df]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Rebleeding is an important cause of death and disability in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH). In order to prevent rebleeding, the preferred strategy is aneurysm ablation (removal) as early as possible. However, in clinical practice some patients are not suitable for surgical treatment, or prefer conservative treatments. In some countries, therefore, total bedrest for four to six weeks has been considered one of the basic interventions to avoid rebleeding. However, the influence of bedrest on outcome in patients with SAH is not well known.

Objectives

To establish whether early mobilisation (less than four weeks after symptom onset) compared with delayed mobilisation (defined as patients staying in bed for at least four weeks after symptom onset) in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH), who have not had or could not have any surgical treatment for the aneurysm, will increase the proportion of deaths from rebleeding.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (May 2012), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 6), the Chinese Stroke Trials Register (May 2012), MEDLINE (1950 to June 2012), EMBASE (1980 to June 2012), Web of Science Conference Proceedings (1990 to May 2012), CINAHL (1982 to June 2012), AMED (1985 to June 2012), PEDro (May 2012), REHABDATA (May 2012) and CIRRIE Database of International Rehabilitation Research (May 2012). In addition, we searched five Chinese databases, ongoing trials registers and relevant reference lists.

Selection Criteria

We planned to include randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing early mobilisation (within four weeks after symptom onset) with delayed mobilisation (after four weeks).

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion and exclusion. We resolved disagreements by discussion.

Main Results

In the absence of any suitable RCTs addressing this topic, we were unable to perform a meta-analysis. Data from recent observational studies suggested the period of greatest risk for rebleeding occurs more frequently in the early period, especially within 24 hours of the initial SAH. The impact of bedrest on aneurysm care should be clarified.

Authors' Conclusions

There are no RCTs or controlled trials that provide evidence for, or against, staying in bed for at least four weeks after symptom onset in patients with aneurysmal SAH, who have not had, or could not have, surgical treatment for the aneurysm. Treatment strategies to reduce the risk of rebleeding in SAH patients before aneurysm ablation, or in those not suitable for surgical treatment, or who prefer conservative treatments, deserve attention.

There are other strategies that have a slightly less clear therapeutic value. Statins have low quality evidence of benefit. It is recommended to continue statins if the patient is already receiving them but not to initiate them in statin-naive patients. Tranexamic acid is somewhat effective in the prevention of rebleeding early after aSAH but does not have a clear benefit in preventing DCI. Low-dose intravenous high–molecular-weight heparin reduces DCI by half compared with subcutaneous heparin at similar dosages. It also reduces delayed cognitive deficits that are frequently associated with aSAH; this is thought to be related to greater bioavailability and potential anti-inflammatory activity in addition to the anticoagulant effect of the intravenous heparin. White blood cell counts and neutrophil to lymphocyte ratios may be predictive for the development of DCI, and early neutrophil depletion shows promise for preventing DCI in a mouse SAH model. There are also many more pharmacologic and biological strategies currently under investigation.

Milrinone has been identified as a promising therapeutic agent for DCI and, in this issue of JNA, Bernier et alreview milrinone DCI treatment studies. Milrinone is a phosphodiesterase III inhibitor that increases cAMP, improves cardiac lusitropy and contractility and thus perfusion; it also increases cGMP and incites vasodilation. Milrinone does not have any known direct neuronal effects. The protocols in the studies reviewed by Bernier et alincluded IA, intravenous (IV) or both IA and IV administration of milrinone with widely variable dosing regimens. Hypotension requiring pressor therapy was the main complication reported. Bernier et alconclude that the available evidence suggests that IA and IV milrinone are safe and effective treatments for DCI and associated with improved long-term functional outcomes. However, studies to date are limited to retrospective case series and single-center cohorts. Bernier et alpropose a multicenter randomized study with uniform protocols involving escalating doses of IV and IA milrinone to treat DCI, with primary clinical neurological and safety outcomes. Since early aggressive therapy of DCI is promising, consideration should also be given to adding a preventive aspect to the proposal. We challenge the readership of JNA to tackle the milrinone project proposed by Bernier and colleagues.

### Beyond the bleed: complications after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. pathophysiology, clinical implications, and management strategies: a review [^ddd2d96c]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage is a critical condition with high case-fatality and lasting impacts on survivors. Acute events that are the direct result of aneurysm rupture, such as acute ischemia, elevated intracranial pressure, cerebral edema, seizures, and hydrocephalus, lead to early brain injury. A delayed cascade of processes, including a prominent systemic inflammatory response, may lead to secondary brain injury and delayed cerebral ischemia, which often further impairs recovery. Systemic complications, including cardiac and pulmonary dysfunction, fever, and electrolyte imbalances, arise in the interplay between early and secondary brain injury and challenge the clinical course. Early management focuses on the prevention of rebleeding mainly through aneurysm securement, amelioration of early brain injury through cerebrospinal fluid drainage, control of intracranial pressure, and organ support to avoid or attenuate secondary brain injury. Nimodipine remains the only pharmacological agent shown to reduce delayed cerebral ischemia, and lumbar drainage of cerebrospinal fluid to reduce subarachnoid blood may improve outcome. Management strategies for hemodynamic interventions, seizures, intracranial pressure control, large artery vasospasm, and electrolytes remain consensus-based and with large variation in practice. Several advances in understanding inflammation and delayed cerebral ischemia, as well as in monitoring and interventions hold promise, but robust trials are needed to refine protocols and improve patient recovery. Understanding and mitigating the cascade of damage from rupture to recovery is essential to reduce the burden of this devastating condition. In this review, we appraise the current understanding of the pathophysiology of post-rupture complications as well as scientific and management data, with a focus on recent advances.

Blood pressure management after aSAH emphasizes avoiding variability and overly rapid or excessive reduction; the writing group recommends gradual reduction of blood pressure when patients are severely hypertensive (> 180–200 mm Hg) while ensuring strict avoidance of hypotension (mean arterial pressure < 65 mm Hg) and close neurological monitoring. Sudden, profound reduction of blood pressure should be avoided, and although it is reasonable to treat severe hypertension on presentation, there is insufficient evidence to recommend a particular blood pressure target; previous guidelines have suggested keeping the systolic blood pressure < 160 mm Hg or < 180 mm Hg, and a meta-analysis suggested higher rates of rebleeding with systolic blood pressure > 160 mm Hg but not with systolic blood pressure < 140 mm Hg, while available evidence is insufficient to recommend any specific blood pressure target.

Treatment of the aneurysm (surgical clipping/endovascular treatment)

Timely repair of ruptured aneurysms reduces the risk of rebleeding and allows for more targeted and safer management of DCI. Studies suggest that early aneurysm securement, i.e. within 24–72 h from onset of aSAH, yields better outcomes than delayed treatment after 7–10 days. Complete obliteration of the aneurysm during initial treatment is vital to minimize rebleeding risk and risks associated with the need for retreatment. In cases where complete obliteration is not immediately feasible, securing the rupture site during the acute phase reduces the risk of early rebleeding. Retreatment within 1–3 months is then recommended to prevent future rebleeding.

The choice of the method to treat the ruptured aneurysm is complex and necessitates a careful balance between securing the aneurysm and the associated procedural risks. This multidisciplinary decision-making process involves evaluating patient- and aneurysm-specific factors, including age, aneurysm characteristics (such as location, size, and configuration) and degree of intraparenchymal clot burden.

The two primary approaches for aneurysm treatment are open surgical techniques and endovascular methods. Each option presents distinct advantages and disadvantages. Coiling is generally preferred over open clipping if the aneurysm is amenable to such a technique, although differential considerations apply based on the setting. Good-grade aSAH patients from ruptured aneurysms of the anterior circulation are often equally suitable for both primary coiling and clipping; primary coiling is generally preferred to clipping as it is linked to improved 1-year functional outcomes. Similarly, some demographical subpopulations, such as older patients, may be preferably treated with coiling, whereas in case of longer life expectancy and better long-term protection from re-rupture, clipping should be taken into consideration. In addition, most posterior circulation aneurysms benefit from endovascular coiling over surgical clipping. Finally, aneurysm morphology (e.g. wide neck) may favour one procedure over another, and placing high-density stents (such as pipeline) over the necks of aneurysms unsuitable for clipping or coiling can be considered. However, the evidence supporting treatment recommendations is somewhat limited, particularly concerning the comparison of various, especially newer, endovascular techniques with each other and surgical methods, and in most cases, the choice is made according to clinical features but also local practice and expertise.

### The critical care management of poor-grade subarachnoid haemorrhage [^2686e784]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Early aneurysm repair is generally considered the most important strategy to reduce the risk of aneurysm re-rupture. However, evidence for optimum timing of treatment is limited, and it is unclear whether ultra-early treatment (less than 24 hours) is superior to early aneurysm repair (within 72 hours). A recently published retrospective data analysis comparing ultra-early treatment with repair performed within 24–72 hours after haemorrhage suggests that aneurysm occlusion can be performed safely within 72 hours after aneurysm rupture. The American Heart Association/American Stroke Association recommend as a Class IB Recommendation that "surgical clipping or endovascular coiling of the ruptured aneurysm should be performed as early as feasible in the majority of patients to reduce the rate of re-bleeding after SAH". This recommendation for timing of aneurysm intervention is corroborated by the European Stroke Organization Guidelines for the Management of Intracranial Aneurysms and Subarachnoid Haemorrhage, which stated that "aneurysm should be treated as early as logistically and technically possible to reduce the risk of re-bleeding; if possible it should be aimed to intervene at least within 72 hours after onset of first symptoms".

Aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage (aSAH) is a rare yet profoundly debilitating condition associated with high global case fatality and morbidity rates. The key determinants of functional outcome include early brain injury, rebleeding of the ruptured aneurysm and delayed cerebral ischaemia. The only effective way to reduce the risk of rebleeding is to secure the ruptured aneurysm quickly. Prompt diagnosis, transfer to specialized centers, and meticulous management in the intensive care unit (ICU) significantly improved the prognosis of aSAH. Recently, multimodality monitoring with specific interventions to correct pathophysiological imbalances has been proposed. Vigilance extends beyond intracranial concerns to encompass systemic respiratory and haemodynamic monitoring, as derangements in these systems can precipitate secondary brain damage. Challenges persist in treating aSAH patients, exacerbated by a paucity of robust clinical evidence, with many interventions showing no benefit when tested in rigorous clinical trials. Given the growing body of literature in this field and the issuance of contemporary guidelines, our objective is to furnish an updated review of essential principles of ICU management for this patient population. Our review will discuss the epidemiology, initial stabilization, treatment strategies, long-term prognostic factors, the identification and management of post-aSAH complications. We aim to offer practical clinical guidance to intensivists, grounded in current evidence and expert clinical experience, while adhering to a concise format.

Blood pressure targets for the prevention of rebleeding of ruptured aneurysm — In patients with aSAH, there is insufficient evidence to recommend a blood pressure reduction goal for the treatment of hypertension before aneurysm treatment; lack of evidence to recommend a specific goal does not necessarily imply that blood pressure reduction is not helpful before aneurysm treatment. The panel univocally agreed that the quality of available evidence was too low to support the recommendation of a target for blood pressure reduction versus no blood pressure reduction, investigations are limited to retrospective and observational data, and elevated systolic blood pressure, particularly above 160 mm Hg, has been associated with aneurysm rebleeding.

Conclusions and future perspectives

aSAH still has high mortality and morbidity, which significantly depend on the initial severity and the occurrence of early and late complications. Management of this entity in specialized centres with dedicated personnel may improve outcomes. A growing body of evidence is available regarding the ICU management of these patients, but still significant knowledge gaps and a lack of high-quality data remain. Future research and randomized controlled trials are warranted in order to understand better the management of early and late complications in this population, especially regarding DCI detection and treatment (in the ESM we present a list of the ongoing trials on aSAH). In particular, research should focus on the aim to address the gaps in the understanding of aSAH pathophysiology and strategies that could improve long term outcomes.

Clinical grading scales in aSAH — supportive evidence and definitions: Several studies have established the efficacy of clinical grades to predict outcomes such as HH and WFNS grades. Other classification systems such as the Yasargil grading, the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), and the Johns Hopkins GCS grading scale have been introduced. Recent combination of radiographic (eg, Fisher) and clinical grades has led to composite scores such as the VASOGRADE, HAIR (HH grade, age, IVH, rebleed), SAHIT (Subarachnoid Hemorrhage International Trialists), and SAH scores. Most literature defines high-grade SAH as a clinical HH grade 4 and 5 or WFNS grade 4 and 5. Although aneurysm treatment may prevent re-rupture, treatment needs to be individualized according to patient-specific factors such as medical comorbidities and pre-hemorrhage functional status and should incorporate shared decision-making with the family or surrogate decision makers.

### 2023 guideline for the management of patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage: a guideline from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^dade2bfa]. Stroke (2023). Medium credibility.

Aim

The "2023 Guideline for the Management of Patients With Aneurysmal Subarachnoid Hemorrhage" replaces the 2012 "Guidelines for the Management of Aneurysmal Subarachnoid Hemorrhage". The 2023 guideline is intended to provide patient-centric recommendations for clinicians to prevent, diagnose, and manage patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage.

Methods

A comprehensive search for literature published since the 2012 guideline, derived from research principally involving human subjects, published in English, and indexed in MEDLINE, PubMed, Cochrane Library, and other selected databases relevant to this guideline, was conducted between March 2022 and June 2022. In addition, the guideline writing group reviewed documents on related subject matter previously published by the American Heart Association. Newer studies published between July 2022 and November 2022 that affected recommendation content, Class of Recommendation, or Level of Evidence were included if appropriate. Structure: Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage is a significant global public health threat and a severely morbid and often deadly condition. The 2023 aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage guideline provides recommendations based on current evidence for the treatment of these patients. The recommendations present an evidence-based approach to preventing, diagnosing, and managing patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage, with the intent to improve quality of care and align with patients' and their families' and caregivers' interests. Many recommendations from the previous aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage guidelines have been updated with new evidence, and new recommendations have been created when supported by published data.

### Prophylactic therapies for morbidity and mortality after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage: a systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomized trials [^0c756c4e]. Stroke (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) is associated with high mortality and morbidity. We aimed to determine the relative benefits of pharmacological prophylactic treatments in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage by performing a network meta-analysis of randomized trials.

Methods

We searched Medline, Web of Science, Embase, Scopus, ProQuest, and Cochrane Central to February 2020. Pairs of reviewers independently identified eligible trials, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias. Eligible trials compared the prophylactic effects of any oral or intravenous medications or intracranial drug-eluting implants to one another or placebo or standard of care in adult hospitalized patients with confirmed aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. We used the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach to assess the certainty of the evidence.

Results

We included 53 trials enrolling 10415 patients. Nimodipine likely reduces all-cause mortality compared to placebo (odds ratio [OR],0.73 [95% CI, 0.53–1.00]; moderate certainty; absolute risk reduction (ARR), -3.35%). Nimodipine (OR, 1.46 [95% CI, 1.07–1.99]; high certainty; absolute risk increase, 8.25%) and cilostazol (OR, 3.73 [95% CI, 1.14–12.18]; moderate certainty; absolute risk increase, 23.15%) were the most effective treatments in improving disability at the longest follow-up. Compared to placebo, clazosentan (10 mg/kg; OR, 0.39 [95% CI, 0.22–0.68]; high certainty; ARR, -16.65%), nicardipine (OR, 0.48 [95% CI, 0.24–0.94]; moderate certainty; ARR, -13.70%), fasudil (OR, 0.55 [95% CI, 0.31–0.98]; moderate certainty; ARR, -11.54%), and magnesium (OR, 0.66 [95% CI, 0.46–0.94]; high certainty; ARR, -8.37%) proved most effective in reducing the likelihood of delayed cerebral ischemia.

Conclusions

Nimodipine and cilostazol are likely the most effective treatments in preventing morbidity and mortality in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. Clazosentan, nicardipine, fasudil, and magnesium showed beneficial effects on delayed cerebral ischemia and vasospasm but they were not found to reduce mortality or disability. Future trials are warranted to elaborately investigate the prophylactic effects of medications that may improve mortality and long-term functional outcomes, such as cilostazol and clazosentan.

### Antifibrinolytics in aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage… [^393026e6]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Recurrent bleeding is a major, largely fatal, complication occurring primarily during the first two weeks after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. Among patients who were initially in good condition, rebleeding is the leading cause of death after SAH. 1 The prognosis of an alert patient who has a second hemorrhage declines to that of a patient who is comatose after a single SAH. 2 Approximately two thirds of the patients who have rebleeding die. Rebleeding occurs within two weeks of SAH in 20% of patients. 3 It peaks during the first 24 hours of SAH, when it reaches 8% to 10%. 4 In the next ten days, this complication occurs at a daily rate of approximately 2%. 3 For the remainder of the first month after SAH, recurrent hemorrhage occurs at a rate of 0. 5% per day.

### Management of patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid… [^290f610d]. AAFP (2024). Medium credibility.

KEY POINTS FOR PRACTICE
- The Ottawa SAH rule can be used to clinically rule out aneurysmal SAH.
- Early aneurysm repair at a stroke center that treats more than 35 cases per year improves outcomes.
- Euvolemia and blood pressure stability improve outcomes.
- After aneurysmal SAH, screening for psychological, sexual, and cognitive impairment can improve patient quality of life. From the AFP Editors Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage presents at a mean age of 55 years and affected patients are more likely to be Black, female, or tobacco users or have hypertension. Although patients rarely have a family history of cerebral aneurysm, two or more first-degree relatives with the condition confers a 12% prevalence of cerebral aneurysm. The American Heart Association and American Stroke Association released guidelines for the management of patients with aneurysmal SAH.

DIAGNOSING ANEURYSMAL SAH Classically, aneurysmal SAH presents with sudden-onset headache that immediately reaches its maximum intensity. Warning or sentinel headaches precede up to 43% of these hemorrhages. Aneurysmal SAH can be ruled out in alert patients 15 years or older with sudden-onset nontraumatic headache that reaches maximum intensity within 1 hour, and who have none of the signs or symptoms listed in the Ottawa SAH rule: age 40 years or older, neck pain or stiffness, witnessed loss of consciousness, onset during exertion, thunderclap headache, or limited neck flexion on examination.

### Effect of short-term ε-aminocaproic acid treatment on patients undergoing endovascular coil embolization following aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage [^eccf4d47]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2017). Low credibility.

OBJECTIVE Aneurysmal rebleeding before definitive obliteration of the aneurysm is a cause of mortality and morbidity. There are limited data on the role of short-term antifibrinolytic therapy among patients undergoing endovascular intervention. METHODS All consecutive patients receiving endovascular therapy for their ruptured saccular aneurysm at the authors' institution between 2000 and 2011 were included in this study. These patients underwent endovascular coiling of their aneurysm within 72 hours of admission. In patients receiving ε-aminocaproic acid (EACA), the EACA administration was continued until the time of the endovascular procedure. Complications and clinical outcomes of endovascular treatment after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) were compared between EACA-treated and untreated patients. RESULTS During the 12-year study period, 341 patients underwent endovascular coiling. Short-term EACA treatment was administered in 146 patients and was withheld in the other 195 patients. EACA treatment did not change the risk of preinterventional rebleeding in this study (OR 0.782, 95% CI 0.176–3.480; p = 0.747). Moreover, EACA treatment did not increase the rate of thromboembolic events. On the other hand, patients who received EACA treatment had a significantly longer duration of hospital stay compared with their counterparts who were not treated with EACA (median 19 days, interquartile range [IQR] 12.5–30 days vs median 14 days, IQR 10–23 days; p < 0.001). EACA treatment was associated with increased odds of shunt requirement (OR 2.047, 95% CI 1.043–4.018; p = 0.037) and decreased odds of developing cardiac complications (OR 0.138, 95% CI 0.031–0.604; p = 0.009) and respiratory insufficiency (OR 0.471, 95% CI 0.239–0.926; p = 0.029). Short-term EACA treatment did not affect the Glasgow Outcome Scale score at discharge, 6 months, or 1 year following discharge. CONCLUSIONS In this study, short-term EACA treatment in patients who suffered from aSAH and received endovascular aneurysm repair did not decrease the risk of preinterventional rebleeding or increase the risk of thrombotic events. EACA did not affect outcome. Randomized clinical trials are required to provide robust clinical recommendation on short-term use of EACA.

### Management of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage [^b302d3f1]. Critical Care Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

Acute aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is a complex multifaceted disorder that plays out over days to weeks. Many patients with SAH are seriously ill and require a prolonged intensive care unit stay. Cardiopulmonary complications are common. The management of patients with SAH focuses on the anticipation, prevention, and management of these secondary complications.

Data Sources

Source data were obtained from a PubMed search of the medical literature.

Data Synthesis and Conclusion

The rupture of an intracranial aneurysm is a sudden devastating event with immediate neurologic and cardiac consequences that require stabilization to allow for early diagnostic angiography. Early complications include rebleeding, hydrocephalus, and seizures. Early repair of the aneurysm (within 1–3 days) should take place by surgical or endovascular means. During the first 1–2 weeks after hemorrhage, patients are at risk of delayed ischemic deficits due to vasospasm, autoregulatory failure, and intravascular volume contraction. Delayed ischemia is treated with combinations of volume expansion, induced hypertension, augmentation of cardiac output, angioplasty, and intra-arterial vasodilators. SAH is a complex disease with a prolonged course that can be particularly challenging and rewarding to the intensivist.

### 2023 guideline for the management of patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage: a guideline from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^ee95edb8]. Stroke (2023). High credibility.

Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) — management of cerebral vasospasm and delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) includes the following directives: In patients with aSAH, early initiation of enteral nimodipine is beneficial in preventing DCI and improving functional outcomes. In patients with aSAH, maintaining euvolemia can be beneficial in preventing DCI and improving functional outcomes. In patients with aSAH and symptomatic vasospasm, elevating systolic BP values may be reasonable to reduce the progression and severity of DCI. In patients with aSAH and severe vasospasm, use of intra-arterial vasodilator therapy may be reasonable to reverse cerebral vasospasm and reduce the progression and severity of DCI, and cerebral angioplasty may be reasonable to reverse cerebral vasospasm and reduce the progression and severity of DCI. In patients with aSAH, routine use of statin therapy to improve outcomes is not recommended, and routine use of intravenous magnesium to improve neurological outcomes is not recommended. For patients with aSAH at risk of DCI, prophylactic hemodynamic augmentation should not be performed to reduce iatrogenic patient harm.

### The impact of sedative choice in the management of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage: a scoping review [^1ec2d8bd]. Neurocritical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH), is characterized by high mortality and morbidity, which are directly related to the severity of disease. Approximately 50% of patients with aSAH die within 30 days of aneurysm rupture, and a significant proportion of survivors suffer from debilitating complications. aSAH can be of varying severity, which is largely driven by the volume of blood released into the subarachnoid space and any delayed pathophysiological manifestations of the disease. Initial management focuses on securing the aneurysm and prevention of rebleeding. Subsequent management focuses on management of hydrocephalus, and delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI), which is particularly important with more severe cases.

The prognosis of patients with aSAH is significantly impacted by the occurrence of DCI. Prevention and treatment of DCI remains challenging, despite recent advances in the understanding of the underlying pathophysiological processes. Initial observations of a link between subarachnoid hemorrhage, spasm of the proximal cerebral arteries and DCI led to the conclusion that proximal vasospasm was the sole cause of DCI. However, evidence of ischemic damage remote from perfusion territories of spastic arteries and the failure of endothelin receptor antagonists to improve outcomes from aSAH despite reductions in angiographic vasospasm reinforced the conclusion that DCI can occur even in the absence of spasm of the proximal cerebral arteries. DCI is increasingly recognized to result from a complex combination of factors including, angiographic vasospasm, microvascular constriction, blood brain barrier disruption, formation of microthrombi, inflammation and cortical spreading ischemia.

### Critical care management of patients following aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage: recommendations from the Neurocritical Care Society's multidisciplinary consensus conference [^03444766]. Neurocritical Care (2011). Medium credibility.

Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) critical care consensus from the Neurocritical Care Society states that SAH is an acute cerebrovascular event with devastating central nervous system and multiorgan impact, that SAH patients are routinely admitted to an intensive care unit and managed by a multidisciplinary team, and that a lack of high quality data has led to numerous approaches with limited guidance; existing guidelines emphasize risk factors, prevention, natural history, and prevention of rebleeding but provide limited discussion of complex critical care issues. The Neurocritical Care Society organized an international, multidisciplinary consensus conference with experts from neurocritical care, neurosurgery, neurology, interventional neuroradiology, and neuroanesthesiology from Europe and North America, and a jury of four experienced neurointensivists; recommendations were developed based on literature review using the GRADE system with critical review by an impartial jury. The disclaimer underscores this is an educational service and that no formal practice recommendations should be inferred.

### What's new in subarachnoid hemorrhage [^134245ec]. Intensive Care Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) is a devastating disease first described in the era of Hippocrates. Despite advances in treatment, 1-month case fatality remains as high as 35%, with around one-third of survivors needing lifelong care and a further third having residual cognitive impairment that affects functional status and quality of life. The immediate and delayed effects of SAH on outcome have recently been reviewed in Intensive Care Medicine. There have been advances in the treatment of this devastating condition aimed at reducing early (mainly re-bleeding) or late complications, particularly delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI). The importance of treatment in high-volume centres by a multidisciplinary team cannot be over-emphasised.

Endovascular coiling of intracranial aneurysms represents a major advance in the treatment of SAH and allows minimally invasive and effective treatment. Flow-diverting stents, with or without coils, are an increasingly employed strategy that allows even complex aneurysm to be treated minimally invasively. Clipping of the aneurysm remains an option in the minority of cases that cannot be secured via the endovascular route. Early aneurysm control reduces the risk of re-bleeding and allows maintenance of higher systemic blood pressure to prevent or treat cerebral hypoperfusion. Once the aneurysm is secured, the intensive care management of SAH involves optimization of systemic physiology, and prevention or treatment of DCI and non-neurological complications. Consensus guidelines on the critical care management of SAH have recently been published.
