## Question

How to bridge from heparin drip

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to bridge from a heparin drip for patients on vitamin K antagonists. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about risk stratification of thromboembolism versus bleeding. Then, I should decide whether to interrupt the VKA at all and whether to bridge. Next, I will outline agent selection and dosing if bridging is chosen, followed by precise pre- and post-operative timing. After that, I should verify exceptions and special populations, and finally I will plan post-procedural VKA resumption and summarize the decision logic succinctly with the supporting evidence.

> Let me first confirm the core principle that all decisions hinge on balancing thromboembolic risk against procedural bleeding risk, and that guideline frameworks are designed to individualize this balance rather than apply a one-size-fits-all bridge strategy, so I need to keep both dimensions front and center as I proceed [^114jb8NA].

> I will now examine thromboembolic risk stratification for VKA interruption; for atrial fibrillation without mechanical valves, I should confirm that low-to-moderate risk typically means CHA2DS2-VASc ≤ 4 for men and ≤ 5 for women, whereas high risk is CHA2DS2-VASc ≥ 5 for men and ≥ 6 for women or prior stroke/TIA/systemic embolism, but I need to remember this schema is empiric and not a validated prediction model, so clinical judgment still applies, especially when surgery type elevates baseline risk. For VTE, high-risk contexts include recent VTE within 3 months, severe thrombophilia, or active cancer, whereas low-to-moderate risk applies to remote VTE without ongoing provoking factors, which should temper the impulse to bridge [^117Eu9yG]. For mechanical heart valves, high-risk phenotypes include any mitral position, older-generation valves, or concomitant AF, and this remains a setting where bridging may be reasonable in select patients pending procedure and anatomy, though even here I should verify evolving guidance and procedure-specific data before deciding [^1144uyDx].

> Next, I should review bleeding risk tied to the procedure; minor procedures such as dental work, cataract surgery, many dermatologic procedures, and low-risk endoscopy often do not require VKA interruption, whereas major surgeries with high hemostatic demands generally do require interruption and a longer period off anticoagulation, so I need to check the specific operation and institutional protocols to avoid unnecessary bridging in low-bleed-risk settings [^1136WZW8]. I should double-check neuraxial anesthesia considerations too, because timing for removal and reinsertion of catheters is sensitive to anticoagulant pharmacokinetics and guideline directives, which may further influence pre- and post-procedural heparin scheduling [^113jTXDC].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; for low-to-moderate thromboembolic risk patients, routine bridging is not recommended, and the BRIDGE randomized trial showed that in AF patients forgoing bridging was noninferior for arterial thromboembolism and reduced major bleeding compared with therapeutic-dose LMWH, which strongly supports avoiding bridge in this group [^1146jfak]. For DOACs, I should confirm that bridging is not advised either, given their short half-lives and rapid onset; accumulating evidence and guidelines suggest increased bleeding with LMWH bridging in DOAC patients without thromboembolic benefit, so bridging should be avoided in DOAC interruptions as well [^1143i4N9]. For high thromboembolic risk, I initially thought bridging was routinely indicated, but wait, let me verify the nuance; CHEST suggests bridging for high-risk VKA patients requiring interruption, yet some executive summaries conflict, so I need to align with the full guideline and acknowledge uncertainty, especially outside AF where data are limited and decisions should be individualized with multidisciplinary input [^1126HKPY] [^1113tfeh] [^1144uyDx].

> If bridging is selected, I should confirm the preferred agent; LMWH is generally first-line due to fixed subcutaneous dosing, predictable pharmacokinetics, and feasibility of outpatient management, while UFH is reasonable for severe renal impairment or dialysis where LMWH accumulation is a concern, though I need to ensure that dose adjustments and monitoring are addressed when GFR is very low [^115Lvtn5] [^112vn2YQ]. I should double-check that the term "bridging" refers to therapeutic-dose regimens, not prophylactic-dose LMWH, to avoid conflating VTE prophylaxis with ATE bridging in discussions with procedural teams [^115Lvtn5].

> Let me think about dosing; for enoxaparin, therapeutic bridging is typically 1 mg/kg subcutaneously twice daily, or 1.5 mg/kg once daily if adherence and bleeding risk allow, while dalteparin is commonly 100 IU/kg twice daily or 200 IU/kg once daily, and these are the regimens most aligned with guideline-defined bridging rather than intermediate-dose alternatives, which are not the standard for ATE prevention in this context [^115Lvtn5] [^112vn2YQ]. For UFH, I should target an aPTT of about 1.5–2 times the laboratory control or anti-Xa 0.35–0.7 IU/mL when using therapeutic-dose IV bridging, and I need to be mindful that higher intensity UFH targets have been associated with more bleeding without reducing thromboembolism, so I should avoid overtitration [^115Lvtn5] [^113hw9NZ].

> Preoperatively, I need to ensure timing that minimizes residual anticoagulant effect; for LMWH, hold the last dose about 24 hours before the procedure rather than 10–12 hours, given the 3–5 hour half-life and peak at 3–4 hours, to reduce bleeding risk, and I should verify this timing with the exact surgery start and local protocol [^111vx8Ht] [^113LAAPz]. For UFH, I should stop the infusion at least 4–6 hours before the procedure to allow clearance, recognizing dose-dependent half-life variability and the need to check hemostasis at the time of the case [^117NPHGc] [^115vNp4z].

> Postoperatively, I should confirm when to resume; for LMWH bridging, wait at least 24 hours after low-to-moderate bleeding risk procedures before restarting, and extend to 48–72 hours after high bleeding risk surgery to protect hemostasis, with the first postoperative dose often at full therapeutic strength unless there are concerns for delayed hemostasis, in which case a delayed or lower initial dose can be considered in collaboration with surgery [^114mcHVo] [^115yhoay]. For UFH, I should resume at least 24 hours after the procedure once hemostasis is secured, again adjusting for surgical bleeding risk and patient-specific factors [^1127LBdM].

> I need to ensure warfarin is restarted promptly; generally, resume VKA 12–24 hours post-procedure when hemostasis is adequate, acknowledging that the INR will take several days to become therapeutic and that the bridge, if used, is typically continued until INR is at goal, with earlier discontinuation of the bridge as INR rises to mitigate bleeding exposure [^1136WZW8] [^1178Szfi].

> But wait, what about special populations and exceptions; for AF without mechanical valves, I should avoid bridging given the BRIDGE results and guideline direction, and I should also remember that device implantation may not require interruption at all, with randomized data suggesting continued VKA can be as safe as bridging and shortens length of stay, so I should verify local electrophysiology preferences before defaulting to a bridge [^1146jfak] [^111PF2dn]. For mechanical heart valves, I should confirm that contemporary guidance is mixed; some summaries suggest avoiding routine bridging, whereas others still consider it in high-risk mitral scenarios, so I should individualize and coordinate with cardiology and surgery, especially for procedures with low bleeding risk where uninterrupted VKA may be acceptable [^1113tfeh] [^1144uyDx]. For VTE as the sole indication, I should avoid therapeutic-dose bridging in most cases, reserving it for selected high-risk scenarios such as very recent VTE, severe thrombophilia, or active cancer, and otherwise favor no bridging or postoperative prophylactic-dose heparin while VKA is resumed [^117Eu9yG]. For DOACs, I should not bridge, and I should follow label-based interruption intervals tailored to renal function and procedure bleeding risk, recognizing the lack of benefit and increased bleeding with LMWH bridging in this population [^1143i4N9] [^117NFVUu].

> I should double-check monitoring recommendations; routine anti-Xa level monitoring for LMWH bridging is not recommended, as fixed weight-based dosing is sufficient in most patients, and unnecessary labs can delay decisions without improving outcomes, so I will avoid reflex anti-Xa checks unless there are special circumstances such as extreme body weight, pregnancy, or renal failure where pharmacokinetics may be altered [^111L5NAZ] [^113sYbPx].

> Let me reconsider the overall decision flow to ensure internal consistency; first, I classify thromboembolic and bleeding risk, then I decide whether VKA interruption is needed, next I determine whether to bridge based on risk category and procedure, then I select LMWH versus UFH and dose, then I time pre- and post-procedural heparin precisely, and finally I resume VKA promptly and stop the bridge when INR is therapeutic, adjusting for special populations and multidisciplinary input throughout to minimize both thrombosis and bleeding [^114jb8NA] [^1126HKPY].

> In summary, I need to emphasize that routine bridging is largely obsolete for average-risk AF and for DOAC interruptions, while selective bridging remains reasonable for high thromboembolic risk VKA patients in whom the benefit may outweigh bleeding risk, and precise timing of the last pre-op LMWH dose at 24 hours, UFH cessation 4–6 hours pre-op, and delayed post-op resumption at 24–72 hours based on bleeding risk are the critical safety levers that reduce hemorrhagic complications without sacrificing thrombotic protection when bridging is truly indicated [^1146jfak] [^111vx8Ht] [^117NPHGc] [^114mcHVo].

Bridging from a heparin drip is indicated when transitioning from **IV unfractionated heparin (UFH)** to **subcutaneous low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH)** or to **oral anticoagulation** (warfarin or DOACs). The key steps are: **stop the UFH infusion**, start LMWH 2–4 hours later, or overlap with warfarin for 5 days until INR is therapeutic, or start DOAC when the aPTT is below 1.5× baseline. Bridging is not routinely needed for DOACs due to their rapid onset; reserve bridging for **high thrombotic risk** patients (mechanical heart valves, recent VTE, or high CHA2DS2-VASc) [^1126HKPY] [^117NFVUu]. Monitor for bleeding and thrombosis, and adjust timing based on renal function and bleeding risk [^113LAAPz] [^112vn2YQ].

---

## Indications for bridging from heparin drip

Bridging is indicated when transitioning from IV UFH to alternative anticoagulation or when **UFH must be stopped** (e.g. before surgery or due to bleeding). Common scenarios include:

- **Transition to LMWH**: Stop UFH, then start LMWH 2–4 hours later.
- **Transition to oral anticoagulation**: Overlap UFH with warfarin for ~5 days until INR is therapeutic, then stop UFH.
- **Transition to DOACs**: Start DOAC when aPTT is < 1.5× baseline (typically 2–4 hours after stopping UFH).
- **High thrombotic risk patients**: Mechanical heart valves, recent VTE, or high CHA2DS2-VASc may require bridging [^1144uyDx] [^117Eu9yG] [^113hw9NZ].

---

## Clinical scenarios requiring bridging

| **Clinical scenario** | **Indication for bridging** |
|-|-|
| Mechanical heart valves | High thrombotic risk; bridge with LMWH or UFH [^1144uyDx] [^116ufVzy] |
| Recent VTE (< 3 months) | High thrombotic risk; bridge with LMWH or UFH [^117Eu9yG] [^115Lvtn5] |
| High CHA2DS2-VASc score | High thrombotic risk; bridge with LMWH or UFH [^111M3iFN] |
| Transition to warfarin | Overlap UFH with warfarin until INR therapeutic [^1178Szfi] |
| Transition to DOACs | Start DOAC when aPTT < 1.5× baseline [^notfound] |

## Step-by-step process for bridging from heparin drip

### Transition to LMWH

Stop the UFH infusion and start LMWH (e.g. enoxaparin 1 mg/kg subcutaneously every 12 hours) **2–4 hours later**. Adjust the LMWH dose for **renal function** (CrCl < 30 mL/min: reduce dose or use UFH) [^112vn2YQ].

---

### Transition to warfarin

Overlap UFH with warfarin for approximately 5 days, then **stop UFH when INR is therapeutic (INR 2–3)** for two consecutive days [^1178Szfi]. Monitor INR daily during the overlap and adjust warfarin to maintain the therapeutic range [^notfound].

---

### Transition to DOACs

Start the DOAC (e.g. apixaban, rivaroxaban, dabigatran) when the aPTT is **< 1.5× baseline** — typically 2–4 hours after stopping UFH. No routine bridging is needed because of the **rapid onset** of DOACs [^117NFVUu].

---

## Risks and benefits of bridging

### Benefits

Bridging maintains therapeutic anticoagulation during transitions, **reducing thromboembolic risk** in high-risk patients [^1126HKPY] [^114Mh379]. It also provides flexibility for procedures or surgery when UFH must be stopped [^117NPHGc].

---

### Risks

Bridging increases **bleeding risk**, especially with therapeutic-dose LMWH or UFH [^1146jfak]. It also adds complexity and cost, particularly with inpatient UFH infusions [^1137JFq3].

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing bridging decisions

- **Thromboembolic risk**: High-risk patients (mechanical valves, recent VTE, high CHA2DS2-VASc) benefit from bridging [^1126HKPY] [^114Mh379].
- **Bleeding risk**: High bleeding risk patients may need dose reduction, delayed initiation, or no bridging [^114mcHVo].
- **Renal function**: Adjust LMWH dosing or use UFH if CrCl < 30 mL/min [^notfound].
- **Procedure type**: Minor procedures may not require bridging; major surgeries may necessitate careful timing and dose adjustments [^1161x5Qh].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Monitor for **bleeding and thrombotic events** during and after bridging, and check INR daily when bridging to warfarin until stable and therapeutic. Adjust anticoagulant dosing based on renal function, bleeding risk, and procedure type [^112vn2YQ].

---

## Current clinical guidelines

- **CHEST 2022**: Bridge high thrombotic risk patients; avoid routine bridging in low-to-moderate risk patients [^1126HKPY] [^114Mh379].
- **ASH 2018**: Avoid routine LMWH bridging; individualize based on risk [^1149ARZf].
- **ACC/AHA/HRS 2019**: Balance stroke and bleeding risks; bridge selectively in AF patients with mechanical valves or high thrombotic risk [^1144uyDx].

---

Bridging from a heparin drip is a **targeted strategy** for high thrombotic risk patients or when transitioning to oral anticoagulation. It requires careful timing, dosing, and monitoring to balance bleeding and thrombotic risks.

### Anticoagulation therapy: perioperative anticoagulation-are we at' a bridge too far'? [^116HWte5]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2015). Medium credibility.

The perioperative management of patients with atrial fibrillation who require an elective surgical or other invasive procedure is an area of ongoing uncertainty. Accumulating evidence from observational studies suggests that the use of bridging anticoagulation with heparin, although well-intentioned, might not reduce perioperative thromboembolism and can increase bleeding.

### A call to reduce the use of bridging anticoagulation [^115eDW5R]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2016). Low credibility.

Because of the recent publication of several important studies, there has been a major change in how we think about perioperative management of anticoagulation. Because of these changes, existing consensus guidelines are suddenly out of date and can no longer be used as is, particularly the 2012 American College of Chest Physicians Antithrombotic Guidelines, version 9. We estimate that well over 90% of patients receiving warfarin therapy should not receive bridging anticoagulation during periprocedural interruptions of therapy, except under unusual circumstances and with appropriate justification. Accumulating evidence also suggests that bridging is not indicated among patients receiving direct-acting oral anticoagulant therapy. The large number of patients potentially affected represents an important safety concern and requires an immediate change in practice.

### Bridging anticoagulation: primum non nocere [^111A3CwZ]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

Chronic oral anticoagulation frequently requires interruption for various reasons and durations. Whether or not to bridge with heparin or other anticoagulants is a common clinical dilemma. The evidence to inform decision making is limited, making current guidelines equivocal and imprecise. Moreover, indications for anticoagulation interruption may be unclear. New observational studies and a recent large randomized trial have noted significant perioperative or periprocedural bleeding rates without reduction in thromboembolism when bridging is employed. Such bleeding may also increase morbidity and mortality. In light of these findings, physician preferences for routine bridging anticoagulation during chronic anticoagulation interruptions may be too aggressive. More randomized trials, such as PERIOP2 (A Double Blind Randomized Control Trial of Post-Operative Low Molecular Weight Heparin Bridging Therapy Versus Placebo Bridging Therapy for Patients Who Are at High Risk for Arterial Thromboembolism), will help guide periprocedural management of anticoagulation for indications such as venous thromboembolism and mechanical heart valves. In the meantime, physicians should carefully consider both the need for oral anticoagulation interruption and the practice of routine bridging when anticoagulation interruption is indicated.

### Perioperative management of antithrombotic therapy: an American College of Chest Physicians clinical practice guideline [^112vn2YQ]. Chest (2022). High credibility.

Heparin bridging — management points should be considered when administering heparin bridging, including that bridging is most often done with a low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) using a therapeutic-dose regimen (eg, enoxaparin 1 mg/kg bid, dalteparin 100 IU/kg bid); bridging with therapeutic-dose IV unfractionated heparin (UFH) is another treatment option, for example, in patients with severe renal insufficiency or who are dialysis-dependent; and other types of heparin bridging may include intermediate-dose regimens (eg, enoxaparin 40 mg bid). Heparin bridging should be administered in a manner to minimize the risk for bleeding that would require re-operation or another intervention, and avoidance of major bleeding is important because it typically requires a longer period of anticoagulant interruption that, in turn, exposes patients to an increased risk for thromboembolism.

### The current status of bridging anticoagulation [^1138dfau]. British Journal of Haematology (2014). Low credibility.

For patients prescribed chronic vitamin K antagonist therapy requiring a surgical or invasive procedure, the question of whether or not to bridge and how to bridge is commonly encountered in clinical practice. Bridging anticoagulation has evolved over the years and the evidence base for current practice is deficient in many areas. Clinical trials currently being completed with conventional anticoagulants should help strengthen the evidence base for future practice. The availability of novel oral anticoagulants is a welcome addition, though their optimal management peri-procedure is yet to be determined. Prospective multi-centre controlled studies that can provide the evidence base for novel oral anticoagulant peri-procedural management are required.

Vitamin K antagonist therapy — bridging for a single subtherapeutic INR: For patients with stable therapeutic INRs presenting with a single subtherapeutic INR value, we suggest against routinely administering bridging with heparin (Grade 2C). Supporting observational data include a 2008 retrospective study of 2,597 adults in which 1,080 low-INR patients were matched to 1,517 therapeutic-INR patients with no significant difference in thromboembolic events, and a study of 294 mechanical heart valve patients where bridging with low-molecular-weight heparin was prescribed in 14 cases and thromboembolic event incidence was 0.3% (95% CI, 0%-1.9%) overall and 0.4% (95% CI, 0%-2.0%) without bridging.

### Perioperative management of antithrombotic therapy: an American College of Chest Physicians clinical practice guideline [^113LAAPz]. Chest (2022). High credibility.

Perioperative management of patients who are receiving heparin bridging — pharmacokinetics relevant to timing: LMWHs have an elimination half-life of 3 to 5 hours and a peak action occurring 3 to 4 hours after administration, which informs preoperative interruption and post-operative initiation timing, and UFH has a dose-dependent elimination half-life that is approximately 90 minutes but can vary from 30 to 120 minutes depending on the level of anticoagulation (as reflected by the aPTT or anti-factor Xa levels) at the time of interruption.

### Society of Family Planning clinical recommendations: management of individuals with bleeding or thrombotic disorders undergoing abortion [^116ufVzy]. Contraception (2021). High credibility.

Anticoagulation bridging — who and how to bridge — should be used selectively for high thrombotic risk. If an individual is particularly high risk (e.g., pulmonary embolus within the last 3 months, severe thrombophilia, or artificial heart valve), bridging anticoagulation in the form of intravenous or low molecular weight heparin can be employed only after multidisciplinary discussion. Bridging is advised when the INR is down to 2, unfractionated heparin should be stopped 6 hours before the procedure and low molecular weight heparin should be held on the morning of the procedure, and both can be restarted 6–12 hours after the procedure unless hemostasis intervention is needed.

### Thromboembolic and bleeding risk of periprocedural bridging anticoagulation: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1129PeBx]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS

2.1 Data sources and searches

We used the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐analyses (PRISMA) guidelines 7 and performed a search of PubMed, Ovid and Elsevier, and Cochrane Library for published randomized and observational studies in English from January 1, 2000 to August 30, 2016. We searched with keywords "long‐term oral anticoagulant", "chronic oral anticoagulant", "periprocedural anticoagulant", "perioperative anticoagulant", "uninterrupted anticoagulant", "continued oral anticoagulant", "interrupted anticoagulant", "unfractionated heparin bridging", and "low‐molecular‐weight heparin bridging". References of articles and previous meta‐analyses were also reviewed to confirm that no studies were missed.

### Thromboembolic and bleeding risk of periprocedural bridging anticoagulation: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115nZcRy]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

An estimated 2.5 million patients use oral anticoagulants for the prevention of arterial thromboembolic events in North America, and one‐tenth of them require temporary interruption in preparation for an elective procedure or surgery. 1, 2 However, the safety and efficacy of bridging anticoagulation is not completely clarified for patients who need an anticoagulation interruption before invasive procedures. Two main concerns remain unsolved, the risk of thromboembolism, and the risk of bleeding. 1, 2

To reduce the bleeding risk for patients undergoing invasive procedures, oral anticoagulant is typically interrupted prior to the procedure, and then continued when hemostasis is achieved postprocedurally. 1, 2 Because the interruption of anticoagulation may expose patients to the risk of thromboembolism, heparin bridging (unfractionated heparin [UFH] or low‐molecular‐weight heparin [LMWH]) is administered to minimize the period of inadequate level of anticoagulation. 1, 2 It is of great importance to confirm whether bridging therapy reduces thromboembolic risk and to ascertain the safety of bridging therapy in relation to bleeding risk. 3

There have been many published articles related to bridging anticoagulation, 4, 5 but the quality of evidence with best practices is uneven across studies. Current guidelines from the 2019 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association suggest bridging anticoagulation used in patients with a high thrombosis risk, such as certain mechanical valve prostheses or recent pulmonary embolism during interruption of vitamin K antagonist (VKA) therapy. 3 However, these recommendations are primarily based on observational studies and experts' opinions. 3

Although Siegal and colleagues concluded that bridging anticoagulation increases bleeding risk and produces similar thromboembolic risk, their review included only one underpowered randomized trial together with some observational studies with no control arm to assess the safety and efficacy of bridging therapy. 6 To better clarify the risk and benefit of bridging therapy, we updated the current published data and conducted a meta‐analysis to compare the periprocedural thromboembolic and hemorrhagic risks between patients receiving interrupted anticoagulation with or without bridging therapy and continuous oral anticoagulation.

### Chronically anticoagulated patients who need surgery: can low-molecular-weight heparins really be used to "bridge" patients instead of intravenous unfractionated heparin? [^1115K8hg]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2009). Low credibility.

Patients at high risk of arterial or venous thromboembolic events often receive chronic treatment with long-term oral anticoagulants such as warfarin. However, if these patients require an invasive procedure, they may require a temporary interruption of their warfarin therapy to minimize their bleeding risk during the procedure. As warfarin has a long half-life and an unpredictable pharmacokinetic profile, short-acting parenteral anticoagulants, such as unfractionated heparin (UFH) and low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), may be of benefit in protecting the patient from thromboemboli while their warfarin dose is withheld. Such "bridging therapy" has traditionally been provided in-hospital with intravenous UFH; however, recent data have suggested that LMWH may be an effective alternative, with potential cost-savings due to the ability to provide bridging therapy in the outpatient setting.

### The bridging conundrum: perioperative management of direct oral anticoagulants for venous thromboembolism [^1111NE6p]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2023). Medium credibility.

Most patients diagnosed with venous thromboembolism (VTE) are currently treated with direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs). Before an invasive procedure or surgery, clinicians face the challenging decision of how to best manage DOACs. Should the DOAC be held, for how long, and are there instances where bridging with other anticoagulants should be considered? Although clinical trials indicate that most patients taking DOACs for atrial fibrillation do not require bridging anticoagulation, the optimal strategy for patients with a history of VTE is undefined. In this review, we present a case-based discussion for DOAC interruption perioperatively in patients receiving anticoagulation for management of VTE.

### Who are we bridging? Description of warfarin patients receiving injectable bridging therapy [^115cZLCW]. Thrombosis Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The evidence guiding the decision to provide injectable anticoagulant bridging therapy during periods of subtherapeutic warfarin anticoagulation is sparse. This study aims to identify the types of patients currently bridged within an academic medical center's Thrombosis Service, to highlight patient populations for future study of bridging outcomes.

Methods

This descriptive cohort study included patients taking warfarin managed by University of Utah Health Thrombosis Service who received outpatient enoxaparin bridging between January 1 and December 31, 2022. Anticoagulation indication, reason for bridging, and type of procedure were validated via manual chart review.

Results

During the one-year study period, 181 unique patients (9.4% of the service's total warfarin population) experienced 244 bridging episodes, mostlyin the periprocedural setting (67.6%) for gastrointestinal-type procedures (39.4%). The most common anticoagulation indications in all bridged patients were antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) (23.2%), venous thromboembolism (VTE) (21.5%), or a mechanical mitral valve plus another indication (13.3%). Most bridging episodes for VTE occurred > 3 months from the acute event, with the rationale for bridging including breakthrough VTE (31%) or APS (23%). Just over one-half of bridged patients fit the guideline-recommended criteria for high thrombotic risk, and just over one-third were low-moderate thrombotic risk.

Conclusions

In this one-year outpatient study, warfarin patients received enoxaparin bridging most commonly due to a gastrointestinal procedural interruption in the setting of APS, VTE with a prior breakthrough thrombotic event, or mechanical mitral valve. Just over one-third of bridged patients were guideline-classified as low-moderate thrombotic risk, indicating these populations may warrant further investigation or bridging de-escalation.

Perioperative antithrombotic management approach — individualized, patient-centric care aims to minimize perioperative thromboembolism and bleeding, is anchored on assessing patients' risk for thromboembolism and surgery/procedure-related bleeding, and uses empiric risk classification schemes that require prospective validation to help determine if perioperative anticoagulation interruption is needed and, among VKA-treated patients, if heparin bridging is needed.

### Short-term risk of bleeding during heparin bridging at initiation of vitamin K antagonist therapy in more than 90 000 patients with Nonvalvular atrial fibrillation managed in outpatient care [^112FM2o4]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF), a treatable risk factor for ischemic stroke, is considered a worldwide epidemic predicted to increase in the coming decades. Indeed, in 2010, the estimated global prevalence of AF was 33.5 million. 1 Oral anticoagulation is the cornerstone treatment for NVAF patients with a moderate or high risk of thromboembolic complication. 2

Although direct oral anticoagulants (dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban) have been on the market since 2010, vitamin K antagonists (VKAs: warfarin, acenocoumarol, fluindione) remain a standard treatment in the management of NVAF.

Recently, several studies have examined the risks of bleeding and of ischemic stroke and systemic embolism (IS/SE) associated with perioperative heparin bridging anticoagulation in patients with NVAF. 3, 4, 5, 6 However, no studies have investigated bridging risks during VKA initiation in outpatient settings.

It has been shown that the bleeding risk is highest during the first month of VKA initiation. 7 This risk may be greatest when a VKA is combined with another antithrombotic agent, particularly in patients for whom a bridging therapy is indicated. Bridging therapy at the initiation of VKA therapy consists of transitioning a bridging agent (low‐molecular‐weight heparin [LMWH] or other pentasaccharide, eg, fondaparinux and unfractionated heparin) to a VKA.

There is an overall consensus in favor of a bridging therapy prior to urgent cardioversion in patients with life‐threatening hemodynamic instability caused by new‐onset NVAF. 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 The recommendation in guidelines 9, 10, 12 and summaries of product characteristics 14, 15 is less clear for those with stable NVAF who do not require rapid anticoagulation. In real‐life conditions, a bridging regimen is commonly used in those with a low stroke risk. 16, 17, 18, 19 This practice is not supported by evidence.

VKA use has declined recently in favor of direct oral anticoagulants; however, the latest available results have shown that they are still more widely used than direct oral anticoagulants. 20, 21, 22, 23, 24 Since millions of patients worldwide may be at risk of being unnecessarily exposed to bridging therapy, adverse health outcomes associated with management of VKA still warrant investigation.

Therefore, the purpose of this cohort study was to assess the safety and effectiveness of a bridging regimen during the initiation of VKA therapy in NVAF patients in outpatient care.

### Heparin bridge is associated with more post-polypectomy bleeding and emergency department visits among anticoagulated patients [^117HmwrF]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Colonoscopy remains the preferred method for prevention of colorectal cancer, serving as both a screening and a therapeutic modality. With an estimated 22.4 million colonoscopies performed annually in the United States and another 11 million individuals estimated to be taking anticoagulant therapy, gastroenterologists will increasingly need to be familiar with these medications and understand the associated adverse events. It is essential for clinicians to understand, and more importantly reduce, procedure-associated adverse events, including the most common post-polypectomy bleeding. Reported to occur in approximately 0.3–10% of cases overall, the incidence of post-polypectomy bleeding related specifically to a population of patients on anticoagulants is less well defined.

Patients using anticoagulation therapy present a unique and common clinical dilemma for the gastroenterologist: balancing the risk of anticoagulation cessation against the risk of procedure-associated hemorrhage. Additional concerns that must be factored into this decision include the risk of thromboembolic events, reported to be as high as 3% when anticoagulation is withheld. To reduce this risk of thromboembolic events, high-risk patients have traditionally been switched from warfarin to a shorter-acting bridge anticoagulation therapy (i.e. unfractionated or low-molecular-weight heparin [LMWH]). Despite current guidelines from national societies regarding the management of periprocedural anticoagulants, it remains unclear whether stopping anticoagulants temporarily and substituting them with LMWH as a temporary anticoagulant bridge therapy will result in more post-colonoscopy bleeding and a smaller number of thromboembolic events compared to complete anticoagulant interruption.

Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate both the bleeding adverse events and thromboembolic events in patients undergoing colonoscopy who usually take anticoagulants, comparing those using a heparin bridge (hep-bridge) with those who temporarily stop all anticoagulation medications.

### American Society of Hematology 2018 guidelines for management of venous thromboembolism: optimal management of anticoagulation therapy [^1149ARZf]. Blood Advances (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Clinicians confront numerous practical issues in optimizing the use of anticoagulants to treat venous thromboembolism (VTE).

Objective

These evidence-based guidelines of the American Society of Hematology (ASH) are intended to support patients, clinicians and other health care professionals in their decisions about the use of anticoagulants in the management of VTE. These guidelines assume the choice of anticoagulant has already been made.

Methods

ASH formed a multidisciplinary guideline panel balanced to minimize potential bias from conflicts of interest. The McMaster University GRADE Centre supported the guideline development process, including updating or performing systematic evidence reviews. The panel prioritized clinical questions and outcomes according to their importance for clinicians and patients. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was used to assess evidence and make recommendations, which were subject to public comment.

Results

The panel agreed on 25 recommendations and 2 good practice statements to optimize management of patients receiving anticoagulants.

Conclusions

Strong recommendations included using patient self-management of international normalized ratio (INR) with home point-of-care INR monitoring for vitamin K antagonist therapy and against using periprocedural low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) bridging therapy. Conditional recommendations included basing treatment dosing of LMWH on actual body weight, not using anti-factor Xa monitoring to guide LMWH dosing, using specialized anticoagulation management services, and resuming anticoagulation after episodes of life-threatening bleeding.

### How I treat anticoagulated patients undergoing an elective procedure or surgery [^1118PP1p]. Blood (2012). Low credibility.

The periprocedural management of patients receiving long-term oral anticoagulant therapy remains a common but difficult clinical problem, with a lack of high-quality evidence to inform best practices. It is a patient's thromboembolic risk that drives the need for an aggressive periprocedural strategy, including the use of heparin bridging therapy, to minimize time off anticoagulant therapy, while the procedural bleed risk determines how and when postprocedural anticoagulant therapy should be resumed. Warfarin should be continued in patients undergoing selected minor procedures, whereas in major procedures that necessitate warfarin interruption, heparin bridging therapy should be considered in patients at high thromboembolic risk and in a minority of patients at moderate risk. Periprocedural data with the novel oral anticoagulants, such as dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban, are emerging, but their relatively short half-life, rapid onset of action, and predictable pharmacokinetics should simplify periprocedural use. This review aims to provide a practical, clinician-focused approach to periprocedural anticoagulant management.

Communication and standardization of perioperative management — It is important to have alignment of the proposed management plan among the health-care team and that it is communicated to and agreed upon by the surgeon/proceduralist, so as to avoid miscommunication that may lead to adverse outcomes or a delay of the surgery/procedure, which can be facilitated with perioperative antithrombotic clinics that can be administered in-person or virtually and with the support of online tools. At an institutional level, harmonization of perioperative anticoagulant management care paths that encompass multiple specialties will facilitate standardization of patient management. Standardized management is important because unstructured usual care varies widely, and if anticoagulants are not managed with evidence-based protocols or guidelines in the perioperative clinical setting, patients may be exposed to as much as a 0.5% to 1.0% excess risk for disabling stroke (based on a benchmark risk ≤ 0.5%) and a 3% to 6% excess risk for serious bleeding (based on a benchmark risk ≤ 1.5%), if anticoagulant interruption is too short or too long or if excessive heparin bridging is used.

### The BRIDGE trial: what the hospitalist should know [^115kywJb]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation patients often require warfarin interruption for an invasive procedure or surgery. Heparin bridging therapy has been frequently used during warfarin interruption under the premise of providing a theoretical mitigation against thromboembolism that overweighs expected higher rates of bleeding. Up until recently, little definite clinical evidence was available to guide the hospitalist on optimal perioperative anticoagulant management. The landmark BRIDGE (Perioperative Bridging Anticoagulation in Patients with Atrial Fibrillation) trial provided high-quality evidence that a simple interruption of warfarin in the average atrial fibrillation patient undergoing an elective procedure or surgery is noninferior to bridging therapy for efficacy and superior to bridging therapy in preventing major bleeding. To guide the hospitalist, we propose a treatment algorithm based on these recent data. We review the literature that led to the trial and highlight its practice-changing implications as a proof of concept that calls to question the premise of heparin bridging therapy beyond the atrial fibrillation population.

Vitamin K antagonist maintenance — INR monitoring and isolated out-of-range results are addressed as follows: For patients taking VKA therapy with consistently stable INRs, we suggest an INR testing frequency of up to 12 weeks rather than every 4 weeks (Grade 2B). For patients taking VKAs with previously stable therapeutic INRs who present with a single out-of-range INR of ≤ 0.5 below or above therapeutic, we suggest continuing the current dose and testing the INR within 1 to 2 weeks (Grade 2C). For patients with stable therapeutic INRs presenting with a single subtherapeutic INR value, we suggest against routinely administering bridging with heparin (Grade 2C). For patients taking VKAs, we suggest against routine use of vitamin K supplementation (Grade 2C).

Perioperative management of antithrombotic therapy — CHEST clinical practice guideline scope and strong recommendations — addresses 43 Patients-Interventions-Comparators-Outcomes (PICO) questions for patients receiving long-term oral anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy who require an elective surgery/procedure; it is separated into four broad categories (vitamin K antagonist [VKA]; perioperative heparin bridging while receiving a VKA; direct oral anticoagulant [DOAC]; antiplatelet drug) and generates strong or conditional practice recommendations using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology. A multidisciplinary panel generated 44 guideline recommendations, of which two are strong recommendations: against the use of heparin bridging in patients with atrial fibrillation and continuation of VKA therapy in patients having a pacemaker or internal cardiac defibrillator implantation; separate recommendations address minor procedures, comprising dental, dermatologic, ophthalmologic, pacemaker/internal cardiac defibrillator implantation, and GI (endoscopic) procedures.

### Thromboembolic and bleeding risk of periprocedural bridging anticoagulation: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^117TQSc3]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Abstract

The risk and benefit of periprocedural heparin bridging is not completely clarified. We aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of bridging anticoagulation prior to invasive procedures or surgery. Heparin bridging was associated with lower risks of thromboembolism and bleeding compared to non‐bridging. PubMed, Ovid and Elsevier, and Cochrane Library (2000‐2016) were searched for English‐language studies. Studies comparing interrupted anticoagulation with or without bridging and continuous oral anticoagulation in patients at moderate‐to‐high thromboembolic risk before invasive procedures were included. Primary outcomes were thromboembolic events and bleeding events. Mantel‐Haenszel method and random‐effects models were used to analyze the pooled risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for thromboembolic and bleeding risks. Eighteen studies (six randomized controlled trials and 12 cohort studies) were included (N = 23 364). There was no difference in thromboembolic risk between bridged and non‐bridged patients (RR: 1.26, 95% CI: 0.61‐2.58; RCTs: RR: 0.71, 95% CI: 0.23‐2.24; cohorts: RR: 1.45, 95% CI: 0.63‐3.37). However, bridging anticoagulation was associated with higher risk of overall bleeding (RR: 2.83, 95% CI: 2.00‐4.01; RCTs: RR: 2.24, 95% CI: 0.99‐5.09; cohorts: RR: 3.09, 95% CI: 2.07‐4.62) and major bleeding (RR: 3.00, 95% CI: 1.78‐5.06; RCTs: RR: 2.48, 95% CI: 1.29‐4.76; cohorts: RR: 3.22, 95% CI: 1.65‐6.32). Bridging anticoagulation was associated with increased bleeding risk compared to non‐bridging. Thromboembolism risk was similar between two strategies. Our results do not support routine use of bridging during anticoagulation interruption.

Purpose Of Review

To provide a timely and concise review of the most recent clinical data in the field of bridging (anticoagulation) therapy with heparin for the at-risk patient receiving long-term oral anticoagulation who requires temporary interruption for an elective invasive procedure or surgery.

Recent Findings

A recent systematic review found that the quality of studies of bridging therapy published before June 2001 was generally poor. More recent larger prospective cohort studies and registries of patients receiving long-term oral anticoagulation, including patients with mechanical heart valves, who underwent bridging therapy with mostly treatment-dose low-molecular-weight heparin for both major and non-major elective invasive procedures or surgeries have been completed. These studies reveal an overall thromboembolic complication rate of 1.22 (95% CI 0.81–1.77) and an overall major bleed rate of 2.94 (95% CI 2.28–3.74). Standardized low-molecular-weight heparin bridging regimens using postoperative bleeding risk assessments optimized good clinical outcomes, and bridging therapy with low-molecular-weight heparin appears to be at least as safe as unfractionated heparin and produces substantial cost savings through reduction in length of stay in the hospital.

Summary

Perioperative bridging therapy with heparin, either unfractionated heparin or low-molecular-weight heparin, appears to be safe and effective for patients, including those with mechanical heart valves, receiving long-term oral anticoagulation who require temporary interruption, especially for non-high-bleeding risk procedures such as minor surgery and invasive procedures. Further studies, including randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trials, are needed to optimize bridging therapy for specific patients and procedures.

### Periprocedural antithrombotic management: a review of the literature and practical approach for the hospitalist physician [^111TTkoZ]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Many patients who are on long-term antithrombotic therapy (e.g. warfarin and/or antiplatelet agents) must be assessed for temporary discontinuation for a procedure or surgery, making this a salient topic for the hospitalist physician. Discontinuation of antithromhotic therapy can place patients at increased risk of thromboembolic complications while continuing antithrombotic therapy can increase procedure-related bleeding risk. Bridging anticoagulation with heparin or low molecular weight heparins is often used in the periprocedural period, but a great deal of uncertainty exists about how and when to use bridging anticoagulation. Because there is very little Level 1 evidence to define optimal care, both clinical practice and expert consensus guideline opinions vary. For the hospitalist, it is of critical importance to understand the available data, controversies, and management options in order to approach patient care rationally. This review provides a step-wise literature-based discussion addressing the following four questions: (1) What is the optimal management of antiplatelet therapy in the periprocedural period? (2) Are there very low bleeding risk procedures that do not require interruption of oral anticoagulation? (3) Are there low thromboembolic risk populations who do not require periprocedural bridging? (4) How do you manage patients who must discontinue anti-coagulants but are at an increased thrombotic risk?

Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) bridging — postoperative resumption timing: We suggest waiting at least 24 hours before resuming LMWH bridging after a low-to-moderate-bleed-risk surgery/procedure and at least 48 to 72 hours after a high-bleed-risk surgery/procedure; when resumption is delayed for 48 to 72 hours in patients considered at high risk for postoperative VTE, low-dose LMWH can be administered for the initial 2 to 3 days before transition to LMWH bridging.

A causal relationship between bridging anticoagulation and studied outcomes cannot be confirmed as these findings are based on an observational study. Lastly, although as many confounding factors as possible were taken into account, such as comorbidities and concomitant medications, the confounding effect of unmeasured and/or unknown factors cannot be ruled out. However, our results should not be affected by diagnostic biases since databases to define bridging status and end points are completely independent.

Perioperative antithrombotic management — scope and PICO framework include the following: Approximately 15% to 20% of patients who are receiving anticoagulant therapy will require a surgery/procedure annually, and 10% to 15% of patients with coronary stents will require surgery within 2 years of implantation, highlighting the clinical burden. The current American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST) guidelines have expanded to address 43 Patients-Interventions-Comparators-Outcomes (PICO) questions, and the aims are (1) to provide evidence-based recommendations for the perioperative management of patients who are receiving antithrombotic therapy; and (2) to provide practical guidance to clinicians for managing such patients in the perioperative period. The PICO questions and guideline statements are separated into four broad categories: patients receiving a vitamin K antagonist (VKA) focused on warfarin, among patients receiving a VKA the use of perioperative heparin bridging, patients receiving a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC), and patients receiving an antiplatelet drug.

Heparin bridging — definition and dosing targets defines heparin bridging as administration of a short-acting anticoagulant, typically low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) or unfractionated heparin (UFH), for an 8- to 10-day perioperative period during interruption of a VKA when the international normalized ratio (INR) is below the therapeutic range. A heparin bridging regimen is therapeutic-dose (or full-dose) LMWH, for example enoxaparin 1 mg/kg bid or 1.5 mg/kg daily, dalteparin 100 IU/kg bid or 200 IU/kg daily, or full-dose UFH to achieve a target activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) of 1.5- to 2-times the control aPTT or a target anti-factor Xa level of 0.35–0.70 IU/mL. Although intermediate-dose LMWH regimens (eg, enoxaparin 40 mg bid) have been referred to as bridging, the definition and associated recommendations pertain to therapeutic-dose heparin bridging to prevent arterial thromboembolism (ATE), and this is the bridging dose regimen that has been most widely studied; heparin bridging should also be distinguished from perioperative use of low-dose LMWH (eg, enoxaparin 40 mg daily, dalteparin 5,000 IU daily) administered for prophylaxis against postoperative VTE rather than prevention of ATE.

Conclusion

In centres with experienced operators, maintaining OAC at INR levels of 2 ± 0.3 during the implant or replacement of a pacemaker or ICD in patients at high risk for thrombo-embolic events can be as safe as bridging to i.v. heparin, with the benefit of reducing both the in-hospital stay and the cost of the procedure.

2.2 Data retrieval and quality evaluation

Included studies met all of the following criteria: patients ≥ 18 years of age, long‐term use of oral anticoagulant before a procedure, elective invasive procedure or surgery, comparison of periprocedural bridging anticoagulation and non‐bridging management (continuous oral anticoagulation or interrupted oral anticoagulation without bridging therapy), reporting of both thromboembolic and bleeding events, and articles published in peer‐reviewed journals. Studies with unclear reporting of thromboembolic or bleeding events, case reports, or letters to the editor were excluded. Studies with no control arm or designed specific to patients using novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) were also excluded. Two authors (H.C.K. and F.L.L.) independently reviewed and collected data, including study design, patient characteristics of interest and relevant outcomes. The third blinded reviewer (Y.H.T.) resolved any disagreements between reviewers.

Patients were classified as bridged if they received any bridging therapy with UFH or LMWH in the periprocedural period. Patients were classified as non‐bridged if they interrupted oral anticoagulation without heparin bridging or continued use of oral anticoagulants during periprocedural period. Classification of high and low thromboembolic risk was based on the definitions described in the primary studies.

Primary outcomes were thromboembolic events and overall bleeding events. Secondary outcome was major bleeding events. Thromboembolic events were defined as stroke, transient ischemic attack, systemic embolism, myocardial infarction, deep vein thrombosis, or pulmonary embolism occurring during the follow‐up period. Major bleeding was defined as a need for transfusion, drop in hemoglobin > 2 g/L, requirement for surgical hemostasis, need for rehospitalization, intracranial hemorrhage, or fatal bleeding.

Study quality was assessed with criteria adapted from the Antithrombotic Therapy and Prevention of Thrombosis, ninth ed: American College of Chest Physicians Evidence‐Based Clinical Practice Guidelines. 8 Disagreements on data acquisition were resolved by consensus with the third reviewer.

### Periprocedural heparin bridging in patients receiving vitamin K antagonists: systematic review and meta-analysis of bleeding and thromboembolic rates [^116JDbpx]. Circulation (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Periprocedural bridging with unfractionated heparin or low-molecular-weight heparin aims to reduce the risk of thromboembolic events in patients receiving long-term vitamin K antagonists. Optimal periprocedural anticoagulation has not been established.

Methods and Results

MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases (2001–2010) were searched for English-language studies including patients receiving heparin bridging during interruption of vitamin K antagonists for elective procedures. Data were independently collected by 2 investigators (κ = 0.90). The final review included 34 studies with 1 randomized trial. Thromboembolic events occurred in 73 of 7118 bridged patients (pooled incidence, 0.9%; 95% confidence interval, 0.0.0–3.4) and 32 of 5160 nonbridged patients (pooled incidence, 0.6%; 95% CI, 0.0–1.2). There was no difference in the risk of thromboembolic events in 8 studies comparing bridged and nonbridged groups (odds ratio, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.42–1.54). Bridging was associated with an increased risk of overall bleeding in 13 studies (odds ratio, 5.40; 95% CI, 3.00–9.74) and major bleeding in 5 studies (odds ratio, 3.60; 95% CI, 1.52–8.50) comparing bridged and nonbridged patients. There was no difference in thromboembolic events (odds ratio, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.04–2.09) but an increased risk of overall bleeding (odds ratio, 2.28; 95% CI, 1.27–4.08) with full versus prophylactic/intermediate-dose low-molecular-weight heparin bridging. Low-thromboembolic-risk and/or non-vitamin K antagonist patient groups were used for comparison. Study quality was poor with heterogeneity for some analyses.

Conclusions

Vitamin K antagonist-treated patients receiving periprocedural heparin bridging appear to be at increased risk of overall and major bleeding and at similar risk of thromboembolic events compared to nonbridged patients. Randomized trials are needed to define the role of periprocedural heparin bridging.

### The effect of heparin infusion intensity on outcomes for bridging hospitalized patients with atrial fibrillation [^111M3iFN]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) have a 4‐ to 5‐fold increased risk of ischemic stroke compared to patients in sinus rhythm. 1 The annual risk of stroke is 1.69% to 4.2% in patients with AF, with 15% of strokes in the United States attributed to AF. 2 To mitigate this risk, hospitalized patients are often treated with parenteral anticoagulation during perioperative interruption of oral anticoagulation or while oral anticoagulation is sub‐therapeutic.

Recent studies suggest perioperative bridging in patients with AF provides limited benefit in terms of preventing thromboembolic events, but increases bleeding rates. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 Most studies, including the BRIDGE trial, 3 the only randomized placebo‐controlled trial, evaluated perioperative bridging strategies for elective surgeries, whereas the data for bridging hospitalized patients with acute issues has until recently not been addressed. 5 These studies enrolled predominantly low to moderate thromboembolic risk patients (mean CHADS 2 = 2.1‐2.4 and CHA 2 DS 2 ‐VASc = 3.6‐4.1) and limited patients at higher thromboembolic risk. Studies have also shown that perioperative bridging in AF is associated with a 4‐fold risk of bleeding compared to non‐bridging strategies (any bleed rates: 5%‐34% and major bleed rates: 3%‐9%) with undifferentiated thromboembolic events (0%‐4%). 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 Current guidelines and expert consensus support perioperative bridging with subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin or intravenous unfractionated heparin (UFH) for patients taking oral vitamin K antagonists who are at high risk for thromboembolism, indicated by a CHA 2 DS 2 ‐VASc score greater than 5 to 6 or a prior thromboembolic event. 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 However, there is currently limited data and differing consensus within guidelines and literature regarding UFH dosing intensity for bridging in AF. The perioperative antithrombotic CHEST guidelines recommend targeting an activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) of 1.5 to 2.0 times the control aPTT value (considered low intensity), while the antithrombotic therapy in AF CHEST guidelines recommend targeting an anti‐Xa of 0.3 to 0.7 units/mL (considered high intensity). 10, 11 Furthermore, many major guidelines do not provide any recommendations on anticoagulation targets for bridging in AF. 8, 13, 14 Comparing the safety and efficacy of high vs low intensity UFH infusion regimens has not been addressed.

### Clinical outcomes with unfractionated heparin or low-molecular-weight heparin as bridging therapy in patients on long-term oral anticoagulants: the REGIMEN registry [^114qgPtj]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Patients who receive long-term oral anticoagulant (OAC) therapy often require interruption of OAC for an elective surgical or an invasive procedure. Heparin bridging therapy has been used in these situations, although the optimal method has not been established. No large prospective studies have compared unfractionated heparin (UFH) with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) for the perioperative management of patients at risk of thromboembolism requiring temporary interruption of long-term OAC therapy.

Patients/Methods

This multicenter, observational, prospective registry conducted in North America enrolled 901 eligible patients on long-term OAC who required heparin bridging therapy for an elective surgical or invasive procedure. Practice patterns and clinical outcomes were compared between patients who received either UFH alone (n = 180) or LMWH alone (n = 721).

Results

Overall, the majority of patients (74.5%) requiring heparin bridging therapy had arterial indications for OAC. LMWH, in mostly twice-daily treatment doses, represented approximately 80% of the study population. LMWH-bridged patients had significantly fewer arterial indications for OAC, a lower mean Charlson comorbidity score, and were less likely to undergo major or cardiothoracic surgery, receive intraprocedural anticoagulants or thrombolytics, or receive general anesthesia than UFH-bridged patients (all P < 0.05). The LMWH group had significantly more bridging therapy completed in an outpatient setting or with a < 24-h hospital stay vs. the UFH group (63.6% vs. 6.1%, P < 0.001). In the LMWH and UFH groups, similar rates of overall adverse events (16.2% vs. 17.1%, respectively, P = 0.81), major composite adverse events (arterial/venous thromboembolism, major bleed, and death; 4.2% vs. 7.9%, respectively, P = 0.07) and major bleeds (3.3% vs. 5.5%, respectively, P = 0.25) were observed. The thromboembolic event rates were 2.4% for UFH and 0.9% for LMWH. Logistic regression analysis revealed that for postoperative heparin use a Charlson comorbidity score > 1 was an independent predictor of a major bleed and that vascular, general, and major surgery were associated with non-significant trends towards an increased risk of major bleed.

Conclusions

Treatment-dose LMWH, mostly in the outpatient setting, is used substantially more often than UFH as bridging therapy in patients with predominately arterial indications for OAC. Overall adverse events, including thromboembolism and bleeding, are similar for patients treated with LMWH or UFH. Postoperative heparin bridging should be used with caution in patients with multiple comorbidities and those undergoing vascular, general, and major surgery. These findings need to be confirmed using large randomized trials for specific patient groups undergoing specific procedures.

Vitamin K antagonist (VKA) therapy interruption and heparin bridging — For patients classified as high risk for thromboembolism who require VKA interruption for an elective surgery/procedure, we suggest heparin bridging over no heparin bridging (Conditional Recommendation, Very Low Certainty of Evidence). For patients classified as low-to-moderate-risk for thromboembolism who require VKA interruption for an elective surgery/procedure, we suggest against heparin bridging (Conditional Recommendation, Very Low Certainty of Evidence). Stratification of perioperative thromboembolic risk is empiric with no validated clinical prediction models; a patient's individual risk profile may inform bridging decisions, and the type of surgery may also affect risk, with an anticipated higher risk in patients having open cardiac or major vascular surgery.

Background

The American College of Chest Physicians Clinical Practice Guideline on the Perioperative Management of Antithrombotic Therapy addresses 43 Patients-Interventions-Comparators-Outcomes (PICO) questions related to the perioperative management of patients who are receiving long-term oral anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy and require an elective surgery/procedure. This guideline is separated into four broad categories, encompassing the management of patients who are receiving: (1) a vitamin K antagonist (VKA), mainly warfarin; (2) if receiving a VKA, the use of perioperative heparin bridging, typically with a low-molecular-weight heparin; (3) a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC); and (4) an antiplatelet drug.

Methods

Strong or conditional practice recommendations are generated based on high, moderate, low, and very low certainty of evidence using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology for clinical practice guidelines.

Results

A multidisciplinary panel generated 44 guideline recommendations for the perioperative management of VKAs, heparin bridging, DOACs, and antiplatelet drugs, of which two are strong recommendations: (1) against the use of heparin bridging in patients with atrial fibrillation; and (2) continuation of VKA therapy in patients having a pacemaker or internal cardiac defibrillator implantation. There are separate recommendations on the perioperative management of patients who are undergoing minor procedures, comprising dental, dermatologic, ophthalmologic, pacemaker/internal cardiac defibrillator implantation, and GI (endoscopic) procedures.

Conclusions

Substantial new evidence has emerged since the 2012 iteration of these guidelines, especially to inform best practices for the perioperative management of patients who are receiving a VKA and may require heparin bridging, for the perioperative management of patients who are receiving a DOAC, and for patients who are receiving one or more antiplatelet drugs. Despite this new knowledge, uncertainty remains as to best practices for the majority of perioperative management questions.

Patients on long-term anticoagulation who require interruption of therapy for surgery may receive "bridging therapy" with continuous-infusion unfractionated heparin or low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH). We estimated the costs of bridging therapy with: (1) LMWH self-administered at home, (2) LMWH administered by a nurse to patients at home, and (3) continuous-infusion unfractionated heparin in the hospital. For surgeries requiring an overnight stay, bridging costs are estimated to be 672, 933, and 3,816 US dollars, respectively, for each of these strategies.

### Preparation for pacemaker or implantable cardiac defibrillator implants in patients with high risk of thrombo-embolic events: oral anticoagulation or bridging with intravenous heparin? A prospective randomized trial [^111PF2dn]. European Heart Journal (2009). Low credibility.

Aims

Current guidelines recommend stopping oral anticoagulation (OAC) and starting heparin infusion before implanting/replacing a pacemaker/implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) in patients with high risk for thrombo-embolic events. The aim of this study was to demonstrate that the maintenance of OAC during device implantation/replacement is as safe as bridging to intravenous heparin and shortens in-hospital stay.

Methods and results

A cohort of 101 consecutive patients with high risk for embolic events and indication for implant/replacement of a pacemaker/ICD were randomized to two anticoagulant strategies: bridging from OAC to heparin infusion (n = 51) vs. maintenance of OAC to reach an INR = 2 ± 0.3 at the day of the procedure (n = 50). Haemorrhagic and thrombo-embolic complications were evaluated at discharge, 15 and 45 days after the procedure. A total of 4/51 patients (7.8%) from heparin group and 4/50 (8.0%) from the OAC group developed pocket haematoma following the implant (P = 1.00). One haematoma in each group required evacuation (1.9 vs. 2%, P = 1.00). No other haemorrhagic events or embolic complications developed during the follow-up. Duration of the hospital stay was longer in the heparin group [median of 5 (4–7) vs. 2 (1–4) days; P < 0.001].

Conclusion

Implant of devices maintaining OAC is as safe as bridging to heparin infusion and allows a significant reduction of in-hospital stay.

VTE maintenance and bridging guidance emphasizes VTE-specific dosing and selective use of parenteral bridging. The VTE maintenance dose of rivaroxaban should be 20 mg daily, not 15 mg daily, as studied in the PIONEER-AF-PCI trial. An unusual scenario described is a patient on a treatment dose of a DOAC for VTE prior to PCI who develops significant renal dysfunction, warranting transition to a VKA. In patients requiring a VKA, bridging with low–molecular-weight heparin is associated with increased bleeding risk and should therefore be reserved for patients judged to be at a very high risk of recurrent VTE, such as those within 3 months of a VTE.

Discussion

To our knowledge, this is the first randomized study to show that OAC maintenance is as safe as bridging with i.v. heparin in the implantation/replacement of a pacemaker or ICD in patients at very high risk for thrombo-embolic events (e.g. > 50% had a mechanical prosthetic valve in the mitral position). Moreover, the maintenance of OAC in these patients reduced the hospital stay by a mean of 2.5 ± 0.7 days. This is an important finding, since shortening hospital stay will reduce admission costs importantly. Moreover, one may consider implanting pacemakers as an outpatient procedure, as is currently done in patients without OAC treatment.

A recent prospective observational studyhas analysed the risk of complete interruption of warfarin therapy in a large series of patients who underwent minor interventions. A brief periprocedural interruption of OAC was associated with a low risk of thrombo-embolism and haemorrhage. However, the population included in this study was a heterogeneous group of patients with widely differing thrombo-embolic risk among them. Our study included only patients with high thrombo-embolic risk; > 50% of the population included in our study had a mechanical prosthetic valve and ∼40% had a previous embolic event. Current guidelinesrecommend peri-operative bridging therapy with heparin in this group of patients.

4 DISCUSSION

In this single center retrospective cohort study evaluating 497 hospitalized patients with non‐valvular AF receiving parenteral bridge therapy with UFH, a higher intensity UFH regimen (aPTT: 76‐120 seconds, anti‐Xa level: 0.35‐0.7 units/mL) as opposed to a lower intensity UFH regimen (aPTT: 46‐70 seconds, anti‐Xa level: 0.35‐0.5 units/mL) resulted in significantly increased rates of the primary endpoint of any bleeding (10.5% vs 4.9%, OR = 2.29, 95% CI = 1.07‐4.90) and major bleeding (4.2% vs 0.5%, OR = 7.93, 95% CI = 1.03‐61.1), without reducing the risk of thromboemboli. This is the first study to compare different UFH targets for bridging in AF.

Two deaths were observed in this study. Both occurred in patients who received high intensity UFH regimens during their admission. However, UFH could not be definitively defined as the cause of death in either patient given the complexity of the clinical scenario, procedures and extensive comorbidities.

It is well established that bleeding occurs at a much higher rate than thromboembolism in patients who receive perioperative bridging, at an approximate bleed to thrombosis ratio of 13:1 with a marked increase in the risk of bleeding (OR = 3.6, 95% CI = 1.52‐8.50). 17 Prior studies in the low to moderate risk AF population show increased bleeding events and similar thromboembolic events in those who received perioperative bridging compared to those who did not. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 In 2017, an expert consensus recommended the use of parenteral anticoagulation for bridging patients with AF only in patients with a CHA 2 DS 2 ‐VASc score ≥ 5 and/or a prior thromboembolic event. 8 Furthermore, the 2019 AHA/ACC/HRS focused update on the guideline for management of AF recommends balancing the risk of stroke and bleeding when deciding if a bridging strategy should be implemented. 13 However, the evidence for bridging remains scarce as no studies have shown a decrease in thromboembolic events with a bridging strategy in low to moderate risk patients, and high risk patients have not been adequately studied in this setting. Defining optimal anticoagulation strategies and therapeutic targets are essential to minimize the bleeding risk without increasing systemic thromboemboli.

### Periprocedural management of patients receiving a vitamin K antagonist or a direct oral anticoagulant requiring an elective procedure or surgery [^116WN6EW]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2016). Low credibility.

The periprocedural management of patients receiving chronic therapy with oral anticoagulants (OACs), including vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) such as warfarin and direct OACs (DOACs), is a common clinical problem. The optimal perioperative management of patients receiving chronic OAC therapy is anchored on four key principles: (i) risk stratification of patient-related and procedure-related risks of thrombosis and bleeding; (ii) the clinical consequences of a thrombotic or bleeding event; (iii) discontinuation and reinitiation of OAC therapy on the basis of the pharmacokinetic properties of each agent; and (iv) whether aggressive management such as the use of periprocedural heparin bridging has advantages for the prevention of postoperative thromboembolism at the cost of a possible increase in bleeding risk. Recent data from randomized trials in patients receiving VKAs undergoing pacemaker/defibrillator implantation or using heparin bridging therapy for elective procedures or surgeries can now inform best practice. There are also emerging data on periprocedural outcomes in the DOAC trials for patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation. This review summarizes the evidence for the periprocedural management of patients receiving chronic OAC therapy, focusing on recent randomized trials and large outcome studies, to address three key clinical scenarios: (i) can OAC therapy be safely continued for minor procedures or surgeries; (ii) if therapy with VKAs (especially warfarin) needs to be temporarily interrupted for an elective procedure/surgery, is heparin bridging necessary; and (iii) what is the optimal periprocedural management of the DOACs? In answering these questions, we aim to provide updated clinical guidance for the periprocedural management of patients receiving VKA or DOAC therapy, including the use of heparin bridging.

### Outcomes in patients undergoing periprocedural interruption of warfarin or direct oral anticoagulants [^111ziJQZ]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2022). Medium credibility.

The key strength of our study is the use of our IPTW statistical analysis, which is able to account for various potential confounding variables in the warfarin and DOAC cohorts while maintaining statistical power and generalizability. This approach was not taken with most other studies comparing DOAC and warfarin outcomes in the perioperative period. Although each of those analyses were conducted on randomized, controlled trial populations and thus reduce the effect of confounding variables on outcomes, the samples for these studies are limited to patients who are eligible for randomization. In contrast, our data were not limited to patients eligible for randomization, therefore representing a potentially more generalizable estimate of adverse event rates. Last, our analysis distinguishes between warfarin‐treated patients into both a bridged and a nonbridged cohort, which is critical given the strong evidence associating use of bridging therapy with increased bleeding risk.

Despite these strengths, certain limitations must be acknowledged. First, the modest sample sizes and inclusion of patients from one geographic region may limit generalizability. Second, data on exact perioperative management of DOACs was not available for this analysis. Therefore, it is unclear whether our DOAC perioperative interruption practices are fully consistent with the PAUSE protocol. Third, as with any retrospective cohort study, our analysis is only as accurate as what is depicted in our electronic health records and cannot account for things such as misinformation or lapses in data. Fourth, although the use of IPTW methodology significantly reduces the impact of confounding in the analysis, covariate balance between the two groups are notably different before and after the probability weighting is applied. Fifth, data on the rationale for why bridging was or was not given were not available in the MAQI 2 dataset. Sixth, we do not have data on the use of prophylactic‐dose heparin in the periprocedural period. Seventh, we are only able to comment on association, not causation. Last, although we used a fairly comprehensive list of confounding variables for our matching procedure, it is possible that there are other confounding factors that were not included and influenced our results.

Clinical Considerations in Incorporating DOACs in the Management of VTE

Recently published antithrombotic guidelines support the use of DOAC agents over VKA therapy (Grade 2B recommendation) in patients with DVT or PE without cancer. Despite the significant advance that DOACs represent, they are not without risk, and thus, clinicians need to consider a number of clinical issues to optimize treatment. Assessment of the following factors may be helpful in selecting one DOAC over another or, alternatively, oral anticoagulation with a VKA.

Pharmacokinetic and Dosing Considerations

The pharmacokinetic characteristics of DOACs have been well described. Because the DOACs have predictable and stable pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, unlike VKAs, routine monitoring of anticoagulant activity is not required. However, it is important to note that in clinical scenarios where the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic response may be altered significantly (eg, organ dysfunction or drug-drug interactions), there currently is no readily available coagulation assay approved in the United States that can precisely assess the level of anticoagulation for any of the DOACs. For information on currently available coagulation assays to measure the level of anticoagulation with DOACs, the reader is referred to several recent reviews. Despite this gap, the great majority of patients can be appropriately managed with standard fixed doses for each DOAC, which greatly simplifies many aspects of patient management compared with VKAs. The potential for dosing errors with DOACs is still present, however. The 4 agents have achieved regulatory approval in the United States for the treatment of acute or chronic VTE, each with a different dosing scheme that may differ by indication, adding some complexity for the clinician when selecting the appropriate dose. Table 1 highlights the approved dosing regimens per indication for the DOACs available in the United States.

Depending on the health care setting, clinicians may routinely interact with patients on different DOACs, and care must be taken to ensure appropriateness of the chosen therapy and initial dose. In addition, transition from injectable agent to oral DOAC (dabigatran, edoxaban) or from oral high dose to oral maintenance dose (rivaroxaban at 21 days, apixaban at 7 days) should be implemented at the appropriate juncture. Particularly at times of transitions of care (ie, bridging), the practitioner may be faced with multiple decisions regarding switching agents or alternative anticoagulation. Data to support best practice in switching from VKA to a DOAC or vice versa are, however, limited, although the phase 3 DOAC trials in VTE and atrial fibrillation (AF) as well as best practice reports provide some information.-

### Updated guidelines on outpatient anticoagulation [^1178Szfi]. American Family Physician (2013). Low credibility.

The American College of Chest Physicians provides recommendations for the use of anticoagulant medications for several indications that are important in the primary care setting. Warfarin, a vitamin K antagonist, is recommended for the treatment of venous thromboembolism and for the prevention of stroke in persons with atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, or valvular heart disease. When warfarin therapy is initiated for venous thromboembolism, it should be given the first day, along with a heparin product or fondaparinux. The heparin product or fondaparinux should be continued for at least five days and until the patient's international normalized ratio is at least 2.0 for two consecutive days. The international normalized ratio goal and duration of treatment with warfarin vary depending on indication and risk. Warfarin therapy should be stopped five days before major surgery and restarted 12 to 24 hours postoperatively. Bridging with low-molecular-weight heparin or other agents is based on balancing the risk of thromboembolism with the risk of bleeding. Increasingly, self-testing is an option for selected patients on warfarin therapy. The ninth edition of the American College of Chest Physicians guidelines, published in 2012, includes a discussion of anticoagulants that have gained approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration since publication of the eighth edition in 2008. Dabigatran and apixaban are indicated for the prevention of systemic embolism and stroke in persons with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. Rivaroxaban is indicated for the prevention of deep venous thrombosis in patients undergoing knee or hip replacement surgery, for treatment of deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, for reducing the risk of recurrent deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism after initial treatment, and for prevention of systemic embolism in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation.

### Peri-procedural management of oral anticoagulants in the DOAC era [^1145H6eJ]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Peri-procedural management of oral anticoagulants can be complex and confusing for many providers. It involves a careful balance of a patient's thromboembolic risk and bleeding risk. For every patient chronically taking an oral anticoagulant who will be undergoing an elective procedure, a four step approach may be considered when creating a plan for the oral anticoagulant. (1) Does the oral anticoagulant need to stop for the procedure? (2) If yes, when should the oral anticoagulant be stopped pre-procedure? (3) Does the patient require a "bridging" parenteral anticoagulant? (4) When should anticoagulation be re-started post procedure? Based on the unique features of warfarin versus the direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC), a unique, personalized plan should be developed and tailored to the individual patient. Anticoagulant specialists, such as anticoagulation clinic pharmacists, may help facilitate this process.

### Perioperative bridging anticoagulation in patients with atrial fibrillation [^1146jfak]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2015). Excellent credibility.

The study BRIDGE (atrial fibrillation) was published by Douketis JD and colleagues in 2015 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Pulmonary embolism, Deep vein thrombosis, Atrial fibrillation, Periprocedural management of antithrombotic therapy and Perioperative bleeding. In the BRIDGE (atrial fibrillation) study, the trial question was: is forgoing bridging anticoagulation noninferior to perioperative bridging in patients with AF? In the BRIDGE (atrial fibrillation) study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the BRIDGE (atrial fibrillation) study, the population was: 1884 patients (502 female, 1382 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with AF who need an interruption in warfarin treatment (5 days before the procedure) for an elective operation or other elective invasive procedure. The key exclusion criteria were a mechanical heart valve; stroke, systemic embolism, or TIA within the previous 12 weeks; major bleeding within the previous 6 weeks; CrCl of < 30 mL/min; platelet count of < 100×10⁹/L, or planned cardiac, intracranial, or intraspinal surgery. In the BRIDGE (atrial fibrillation) study, the interventions were: n = 950 avoiding routine bridging (matching subcutaneous placebo BID) n = 934 routine bridging therapy (100 IU dalteparin per kg of body weight administered SC BID from 3 days before the procedure until 24h before the procedure and then 5–10 days after the procedure). In the BRIDGE (atrial fibrillation) study, the primary outcome was: difference not exceeding non-inferiority margin in arterial thromboembolism at 30 days after the procedure (0.4% vs. 0.3%; AD 0.1%, 95% CI -0.6 to 0.8). In the BRIDGE (atrial fibrillation) study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in death (0.5% vs. 0.4%; AD 0.1%, 95% CI -1.1 to 1.3) No significant difference in myocardial infarction (0.8% vs. 1.6%; ARD -0.8, 95% CI -1.75 to 0.15) No significant difference in DVT (0% vs. 0.1%; ARD -0.1, 95% CI -0.27 to 0.07). In the BRIDGE (atrial fibrillation) study, the safety outcomes were: significant differences in major bleeding (1.3% vs. 3.2%), minor bleeding (12.0% vs. 20.9%). In the BRIDGE (atrial fibrillation) study, the conclusion was: in patients with AF who need an interruption in warfarin treatment (5 days before the procedure) for an elective operation or other elective invasive procedure, avoiding routine bridging was noninferior to routine bridging therapy with respect to arterial thromboembolism at 30 days after the procedure.

### Heparin bridge is associated with more post-polypectomy bleeding and emergency department visits among anticoagulated patients [^114ibBvL]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Cohort selection and anticoagulation strategy

Patient records were reviewed and categorized into 2 specific cohorts: a temporary anticoagulation cessation group ("no-bridge") and a bridging group ("hep-bridge"). The choice of periprocedural anticoagulation strategy was based upon patient-specific risk factors and was made by a clinical pharmacist in the hospital's anti-coagulation clinic, where all patients were managed using a standardized Providence VA protocol. In this protocol, patients with atrial fibrillation and CHADS 2 scores of 1 to 2 were not prescribed hep-bridge. Patients with atrial fibrillation and CHADS 2 scores of 3 to 4 were not prescribed a bridge unless the patient had a history of cerebrovascular accident. For those with atrial fibrillation and a CHADS 2 score of 5 to 6, hep-bridge was prescribed. Additionally, any patient with a mechanical cardiac valve was prescribed hep-bridge.

For patients in the no-bridge cohort, warfarin was stopped 5 days pre-procedure and reinitiated immediately following colonoscopy, as per standard protocol. In the hep-bridge cohort, warfarin was held and subcutaneous enoxaparin (1 mg/kg b.i.d.) was started 5 days prior to the procedure. Enoxaparin was stopped on the day of the colonoscopy and warfarin was restarted immediately post-procedure and continued until the target international normalized ratio (INR) was reached. Enoxaparin was typically continued with warfarin for 5 days post-procedure in the hep-bridge cohort. Other oral anticoagulants (apixaban, rivaroxaban) were stopped 2 days pre-procedure, without any hep-bridge, and reinitiated immediately following colonoscopy, as per hospital protocol.

### Executive summary: perioperative management of antithrombotic therapy: an American College of Chest Physicians clinical practice guideline [^112hA671]. Chest (2022). High credibility.

Regarding perioperative care for perioperative bleeding, more specifically with respect to management of antithrombotic therapy (heparins), ACCP 2022 guidelines recommend to consider administering the first postoperative LMWH bridging dose at least 24 hours after a surgery/procedure in patients receiving LMWH bridging for an elective surgery/procedure.

### Perioperative management of vitamin K antagonists and direct oral anticoagulants: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115xsBwQ]. Chest (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The management of patients who are receiving chronic oral anticoagulation therapy and require an elective surgery or an invasive procedure is a common clinical scenario.

Research Question

What is the best available evidence to support the development of American College of Chest Physicians guidelines on the perioperative management of patients who are receiving long-term vitamin K agonist (VKA) or direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) and require elective surgery or procedures?

Study Design and Methods

A literature search including multiple databases from database inception through July 16, 2020, was performed. Meta-analyses were conducted when appropriate.

Results

In patients receiving VKA (warfarin) undergoing elective noncardiac surgery, shorter (< 3 days) VKA interruption is associated with an increased risk of major bleeding. In patients who required VKA interruption, heparin bridging (mostly with low-molecular-weight heparin [LMWH]) was associated with a statistically significant increased risk of major bleed, representing a very low certainty of evidence (COE). Compared with DOAC interruption 1 to 4 days before surgery, continuing DOACs may be associated with higher risk of bleeding demonstrated in some, but not all studies. In patients who needed DOAC interruption, bridging with LMWH may be associated with a statistically significant increased risk of bleeding, representing a low COE.

Interpretation

The certainty in the evidence supporting the perioperative management of anticoagulants remains limited. No high-quality evidence exists to support the practice of heparin bridging during the interruption of VKA or DOAC therapy for an elective surgery or procedure, or for the practice of interrupting VKA therapy for minor procedures, including cardiac device implantation, or continuation of a DOAC vs short-term interruption of a DOAC in the perioperative period.

### Perioperative management of antithrombotic therapy: an American College of Chest Physicians clinical practice guideline [^116MqeJt]. Chest (2022). High credibility.

Perioperative management of antithrombotic therapy — future research needs include assessing the need for perioperative heparin bridging during VKA interruption in mechanical heart valve patients; additional research and clinician consensus on safe DOAC interruption intervals before neuraxial anesthesia or regional nerve block and for severe chronic kidney disease with a CrCl < 30 mL/ min; further study of perioperative management for patients receiving low-dose DOAC regimens (with ASA for chronic coronary or peripheral arterial disease or for the secondary prevention of VTE) and those on antiplatelet monotherapy with a P2Y12 inhibitor; addressing the challenging perioperative management of antiplatelet drugs in patients with coronary stents receiving ASA and a P2Y12 inhibitor; the role of perioperative laboratory testing — antifactor Xa levels during heparin bridging, DOAC anti-factor Xa levels and dilute thrombin time testing, antiplatelet function testing, and viscoelastic testing — remains uncertain; and research is also needed to inform perioperative anticoagulant management of special patient populations (eg, dialysis-dependent) and for urgent/emergency surgery, including the role of laboratory and point-of-care assays to measure DOAC levels and anticoagulant and antiplatelet reversal strategies.

### 2020 ACC expert consensus decision pathway for anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy in patients with atrial fibrillation or venous thromboembolism undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention or with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^114pscrr]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2021). High credibility.

Periprocedural management of anticoagulation (AC) for patients who need percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) — If PCI is elective and can be delayed until treatment with AC therapy is complete, it is preferable to postpone the procedure; in emergencies AC therapy should be stopped and PCI should be performed without delay, and activated clotting time may not be a reliable indicator of anticoagulation for patients taking a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC). For patients awaiting elective or urgent PCI when safe to defer briefly, we recommend the following: for vitamin K antagonist (VKA) therapy, defer until the INR is ≤ 2.0 (some catheterization laboratories may use ≤ 1.5) and thresholds may differ by radial versus femoral access; for DOAC therapy, defer per Table 5, which also discusses bridging and notes there is likely no value in bridging with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) because of similar pharmacokinetic properties to DOAC.

### Perioperative management of antithrombotic therapy: an American College of Chest Physicians clinical practice guideline [^117NFVUu]. Chest (2022). High credibility.

American College of Chest Physicians guideline — perioperative direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) interruption: In patients who require DOAC interruption for an elective surgery/procedure, we suggest against perioperative heparin bridging (Conditional Recommendation, Very Low Certainty of Evidence), supported by evidence that low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) bridging increased major bleeding without thromboembolic benefit in DOAC-treated patients (6.5% vs 1.8%; P < .001; stroke/systemic embolism 0.5% vs 0.3%; p = 0.46), a registry showing higher major bleeding with bridging (OR = 4.6; 95% CI: 1.1–9.9) without significant thromboembolic effect (OR = 1.9; 95% CI: 0.7–5.4), and a meta-analysis reporting 4.8% [95% CI: 3.4–6.2] vs 1.6% [95% CI: 1.2–2.0%]; the guideline notes that the rapid offset and onset of DOACs obviate the need for bridging with unfractionated heparin (UFH) or LMWH in a perioperative setting.

Regarding perioperative care for periprocedural management of antithrombotic therapy, more specifically with respect to patients on VKAs (elective surgeries/procedures), ACCP 2022 guidelines recommend to do not administer heparin bridging in patients receiving VKA therapy for AF requiring VKA interruption for an elective surgery/procedure.

### Perioperative bridging anticoagulation in patients with atrial fibrillation [^114tPkxh]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2015). Excellent credibility.

Background

It is uncertain whether bridging anticoagulation is necessary for patients with atrial fibrillation who need an interruption in warfarin treatment for an elective operation or other elective invasive procedure. We hypothesized that forgoing bridging anticoagulation would be noninferior to bridging with low-molecular-weight heparin for the prevention of perioperative arterial thromboembolism and would be superior to bridging with respect to major bleeding.

Methods

We performed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in which, after perioperative interruption of warfarin therapy, patients were randomly assigned to receive bridging anticoagulation therapy with low-molecular-weight heparin (100 IU of dalteparin per kilogram of body weight) or matching placebo administered subcutaneously twice daily, from 3 days before the procedure until 24 hours before the procedure and then for 5 to 10 days after the procedure. Warfarin treatment was stopped 5 days before the procedure and was resumed within 24 hours after the procedure. Follow-up of patients continued for 30 days after the procedure. The primary outcomes were arterial thromboembolism (stroke, systemic embolism, or transient ischemic attack) and major bleeding.

Results

In total, 1884 patients were enrolled, with 950 assigned to receive no bridging therapy and 934 assigned to receive bridging therapy. The incidence of arterial thromboembolism was 0.4% in the no-bridging group and 0.3% in the bridging group (risk difference, 0.1 percentage points; 95% confidence interval, -0.6 to 0.8; P = 0.01 for noninferiority). The incidence of major bleeding was 1.3% in the no-bridging group and 3.2% in the bridging group (relative risk, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.20 to 0.78; P = 0.005 for superiority).

Conclusions

In patients with atrial fibrillation who had warfarin treatment interrupted for an elective operation or other elective invasive procedure, forgoing bridging anticoagulation was noninferior to perioperative bridging with low-molecular-weight heparin for the prevention of arterial thromboembolism and decreased the risk of major bleeding.

### Standardized low-molecular-weight heparin bridging regimen in outpatients on oral anticoagulants undergoing invasive procedure or surgery: an inception cohort management study [^114nZDMn]. Circulation (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Bridging therapy with low-molecular-weight heparin is usually recommended in patients who must stop oral anticoagulants before surgical or invasive procedures. To date, there is no universally accepted bridging regimen tailored to the patient's thromboembolic risk. This prospective inception cohort management study was designed to assess the efficacy and safety of an individualized bridging protocol applied to outpatients.

Methods and Results

Oral anticoagulants were stopped 5 days before the procedure. Low-molecular-weight heparin was started 3 to 4 days before surgery and continued for 6 days after surgery at 70 anti-factor Xa U/kg twice daily in high-thromboembolic-risk patients and prophylactic once-daily doses in moderate- to low-risk patients. Oral anticoagulation was resumed the day after the procedure with a boost dose of 50% for 2 days and maintenance doses afterward. The patients were followed up for 30 days. Of the 1262 patients included in the study (only 15% had mechanical valves), 295 (23.4%) were high-thromboembolic-risk patients and 967 (76.6%) were moderate- to low-risk patients. In the intention-to-treat analysis, there were 5 thromboembolic events (0.4%; 95% confidence interval, 0.1 to 0.9), all in high-thromboembolic-risk patients. There were 15 major (1.2%; 95% confidence interval, 0.7 to 2.0) and 53 minor (4.2%; 95% confidence interval, 3.2 to 5.5) bleeding episodes. Major bleeding was associated with twice-daily low-molecular-weight heparin administration (high-risk patients) but not with the bleeding risk of the procedure.

Conclusions

This management bridging protocol, tailored to patients' thromboembolic risk, appears to be feasible, effective, and safe for many patients, but safety in patients with mechanical prosthetic valves has not been conclusively established.

### Making safer preoperative arrangements for patients using vitamin K antagonists [^115rZGDq]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Background

In the perioperative phase a balance should be found between the risk of bleeding and the risk of a thrombo-embolic complication. In the Netherlands, the guideline "antithrombotic therapy" has recently been updated. This guideline has partially been based upon the 9th edition of the ACCP guideline Antithrombotic Therapy and Prevention of Thrombosis. It provides recommendations how to deal with VKA in the preoperative phase. The risk of arterial thromboembolism is defined as high when the risk is > 10% per year; for a venous thrombo-embolism it is a monthly risk of > 10%. Patients at high risk of a thrombo-embolic event, such as a patient with a mechanical heart valve prosthesis in the mitral position, have to be bridged after the preoperative discontinuation of the VKA with therapeutic doses of Low Molecular Weight Heparins (LMWH) or heparin in order to minimize the risk of a thromboembolic event. However, this strategy has recently been questioned, because bridging with LMWH results in an increased risk of perioperative bleedingand the efficacy of bridging with LMWH in patients using VKA because of atrial fibrillation was doubted in the 'BRIDGE-trial'

### Heparin bridge is associated with more post-polypectomy bleeding and emergency department visits among anticoagulated patients [^114T7r5H]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Many risk factors have been associated with post-polypectomy bleeding, including age greater than 75 years, polyp size greater than 1 cm, location and morphology of the polyp, resection technique, and notably anticoagulation, with a 3- to 5-fold greater incidence of procedure-related bleeding in patients taking anticoagulants. Rates of thromboembolic events in the setting of temporary cessation of anticoagulation for endoscopy have been reported to be as high as 3%, with an absolute risk of 1% for patients who interrupt anticoagulation for ≤ 5 days. Guidelines from the American College of Chest Physicians regarding anticoagulation management in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation in the periprocedural period recommend considering stopping vitamin K antagonists, based on the risk of thromboembolism and bleeding, and assessing CHADS 2 scores to determine the need for bridge therapy.

Current guidelines from both the European and American Gastroenterology Associations regarding the management of anticoagulation and the use of bridge therapy, specifically in high-risk patients undergoing endoscopy, are largely based on low-quality evidence and expert opinion. The guidelines from the British Society of Gastroenterology and European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy classify colonoscopy with polypectomy as a high-risk procedure for post-procedural bleeding, and suggest that pre-procedural bridge therapy should be used for patients on warfarin who are at high risk for thromboembolic events. These high-risk patients include those with atrial fibrillation and mitral stenosis, patients with a prosthetic metal heart valve in the mitral position, a prosthetic heart valve and atrial fibrillation, and patients within 3 months of a venous thromboembolism. The American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy specifically recommends bridge therapy for high-risk patients with atrial fibrillation on warfarin who have mechanical valves, a history of a stroke, and a CHADS 2 score ≥ 2. The Society also recommends bridge therapy for patients with a mechanical aortic valve, any thromboembolic risk factor, and older-generation and mechanical mitral valve replacements in those with valvular heart disease. However, these societal guidelines from experts are based on very limited data. Previously published studies have compared bridge therapy to temporary cessation of anticoagulation with regard to post-polypectomy bleeding; however, they generally comprised small numbers of patients, while in one of them important thromboembolic event outcomes were not reported.

### Low-molecular-weight heparin as bridging anticoagulation during interruption of warfarin… [^113FhpYg]. JAMA Network (2004). Excellent credibility.

In 108 patients who underwent a high-bleeding-risk procedure, there were 2 deaths possibly due to thromboembolism and 2 major bleeding episodes. Conclusions In patients at increased risk for arterial thromboembolism who require temporary interruption of warfarin therapy, a standardized periprocedural anticoagulant regimen with low-molecular-weight heparin is associated with a low risk of thromboembolic and major bleeding complications. The rationale for bridging anticoagulation is to minimize the time before and after a procedure that patients are not receiving therapeutic anticoagulation and, thereby, minimize the risk of thromboembolism. The conventional periprocedural anticoagulation approach is to hospitalize patients 4 to 5 days before surgery to stop warfarin and administer intravenous unfractionated heparin while the anticoagulant effect of warfarin recedes.

15, 16 Intravenous heparin is stopped 3 to 4 hours before the procedure to avoid a residual anticoagulant effect at the time of the procedure. An alternative periprocedural management strategy is the use of low-molecular-weight heparin for bridging anticoagulation. This approach is appealing because LMWH can be administered subcutaneously, in a fixed weight-based dose, and without the need for laboratory monitoring, 17 thereby obviating the need for hospitalization to administer anticoagulants. The adequacy of postprocedural hemostasis was determined by the same caregivers and was based on a subjective assessment of wound-related blood loss.

In this registry of 650 patients at increased risk for arterial thromboembolism who required temporary interruption of warfarin therapy for an elective procedure, a standardized bridging anticoagulation regimen with LMWH was associated with a low risk of thromboembolic and major bleeding complications in the immediate periprocedural period, and was feasible for out-of-hospital administration. This anticoagulation strategy involved 2 main components: preprocedural and postprocedural dalteparin sodium therapy, 100 IU/kg twice daily, to minimize the duration without therapeutic anticoagulation; and avoidance of postprocedural dalteparin in patients at high risk of bleeding or with inadequate postprocedural hemostasis, and delay in dalteparin resumption in patients with delayed hemostasis.

### LMWH as bridge anticoagulation during warfarin… [^112atfV2]. AAFP (2005). Low credibility.

Temporary interruption of warfarin treatment is sometimes necessary when patients who require anticoagulant therapy need surgery or other invasive procedures. Interruption of anticoagulant therapy can result in a significant increased risk for thromboembolic morbidity and mortality. Many different strategies for bridge therapy use short-acting anticoagulants in patients taking warfarin. One strategy is to hospitalize patients and stop warfarin therapy four to five days before surgery, using intravenous unfractionated heparin as the bridge anticoagulation. Another strategy uses low-molecular-weight heparin as the bridging anticoagulant. Despite these suggestions and the frequency of this problem before surgery or an invasive procedure, these strategies have not been studied vigorously. Douketis and colleagues evaluated the safety and efficacy of a standardized periprocedural anticoagulation regimen using LMWH.

The study included consecutive adult patients who were on warfarin therapy for thromboembolism prevention and had scheduled an elective surgery or invasive procedure that required the normalization of the International Normalized Ratio. All patients received a standard anticoagulation regimen. Warfarin was stopped five to six days before the procedure. Three days before the procedure, LMWH at a dosage of 100 IU per kg twice daily was started. The last dose of dalteparin was given no less than 12 hours before the procedure. On the day of the procedure, if hemostasis was adequate, warfarin was restarted, usually in the evening. If patients had a low risk for bleeding, dalteparin was restarted the following day at the preprocedural dosage and continued until the INR was at least 2.
0. If the patient was at high risk for bleeding, no dalteparin was used, and the warfarin was continued.

The major outcomes measured during the study included thromboembolic events, major bleeding problems, and death. A secondary outcome was increased wound-related blood loss in patients who were not at high risk for bleeding. The rightsholder did not grant rights to reproduce this item in electronic media. For the missing item, see the original print version of this publication. The authors conclude that patients who receive chronic warfarin therapy and require temporary interruption of treatment can be managed with LMWH. They note that this management strategy can be used with a low risk for thromboembolic and major bleeding complications.

### Anticoagulation after cardioembolic stroke… [^115aCAiv]. JAMA Network (2008). Excellent credibility.

Main Outcome Measures Symptomatic hemorrhagic transformation, stroke progression, and discharge modified Rankin Scale score. Results. Two hundred four patients were analyzed. Recurrent stroke occurred in 2 patients. Progressive stroke was the most frequent serious adverse event, seen in 11 patients. Hemorrhagic transformation occurred in a bimodal distribution — an early benign hemorrhagic transformation and a late symptomatic hemorrhagic transformation. All of the symptomatic hemorrhagic transformation cases were in the enoxaparin bridging group. Systemic bleeding occurred in 2 patients and was associated with heparin bridging. There is no consensus on the best way to initiate AC after CES.

Because warfarin sodium takes several days to reach a therapeutic international normalized ratio, 3 strategies are used during that period: warfarin alone or with aspirin; intravenous heparin sodium combined with warfarin; and full-dose enoxaparin sodium combined with warfarin. The decisions of whether to bridge and whether to use heparin or low-molecular-weight heparin were made based on clinical judgment and personal preference of the treating physician. Outcome measures and adverse events were captured prospectively. Severe systemic bleeding was defined as any gastrointestinal tract, intra-abdominal, or external bleeding necessitating transfusion. All of the PH2 cases were bridged with enoxaparin sodium, 1 mg/kg twice daily, composing 10% of the EB group. One patient was aged 40 years and had a patent foramen ovale and a posterior inferior cerebellar artery infarct.

His INR at the time of intracerebral hemorrhage was 2.
2. Many physicians are reluctant to start warfarin treatment without bridging with either heparin or enoxaparin, aiming at prevention of a warfarin-related hypercoagulable state. Indeed, a transient hypercoagulable state may occur when warfarin is initiated without heparin6 and may lead to abnormal clotting and skin necrosis. 7 This is in fact uncommon in routine clinical practice, 8 with most cases associated with protein C deficiency.

### Evidence summary… [^1173Bxaf]. AAFP (2019). Medium credibility.

Evidence-Based Answer A limited number of trials that examined the risk of temporary interruption of anticoagulation before a variety of procedures did not find a reduction in the risk of stroke, but they did show an increased risk of bleeding events and venous thromboembolism in patients who were bridged during warfarin interruption. Consensus guidelines recommend bridging based on individual patient risk of VTE. Evidence Summary A 2016 meta-analysis investigated the risks and benefits of bridging with low-molecular-weight heparin or unfractionated heparin during temporary interruption of warfarin therapy in 13, 810 patients with atrial fibrillation. However, five trials found a decreased risk of major bleeding and any bleeding in patients who were not bridged. 3 Rates of postpolypectomy bleeding were higher among patients who received heparin bridging during the procedure compared with those who did not. Four of the five studies independently demonstrated the same finding. In 2017, the American College of Cardiology published an expert consensus decision pathway for periprocedural management of anticoagulation in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. Bridging is recommended for patients with high risk of VTE.

The decision to bridge should be based on bleeding risk in patients with moderate risk of VTE. Copyright © Family Physicians Inquiries Network. Used with permission.

### Perioperative management of antithrombotic medications… [^1136WZW8]. AAFP (2023). Medium credibility.

Management of Vitamin K Antagonist Medications For patients taking the vitamin K antagonist warfarin, continue the medication if bleeding risk is minimal. With low to moderate or high bleeding risk, stop warfarin; patients with high thrombosis risk should receive heparin before and after surgery. In patients who are at low to moderate risk for thromboembolism, no bridging with heparin is recommended. For atrial fibrillation, the benefits of bridging are less certain because the stroke risk over a few days is low. Warfarin should be stopped at least five days before the procedure and restarted 12 to 24 hours after the procedure if hemostasis has been obtained. Heparin bridging can occur with unfractionated heparin or low-molecular-weight heparin. If intravenous unfractionated heparin is used, heparin should be stopped at least four hours before the procedure and restarted at least 24 hours after the procedure.

If low-molecular-weight heparin is used, give one-half the daily dosage 24 hours before the procedure, and wait at least 24 hours after surgery to give the first postoperative dose of low-molecular-weight heparin. If the surgery has a high bleeding risk, wait 48 to 72 hours before restarting heparin to ensure hemostasis. Management of Antiplatelet Medications Continuing aspirin is recommended for all noncardiac surgery. If stopping aspirin, the American College of Chest Physicians recommends stopping within seven days of surgery. P2Y. 12 platelet receptor inhibitors should be stopped before surgery. Stop clopidogrel five days before surgery, ticagrelor three to five days before surgery, and prasugrel seven to 10 days before surgery. All P2Y 12 inhibitors can be restarted within 24 hours of surgery if hemostasis has been obtained. 12 inhibitor and continue aspirin therapy.

Bridging these gaps with antiplatelet or anticoagulant medications does not improve outcomes. Because these medications can be held one to two days before surgery and restarted one to two days after surgery, bridging with heparin is not recommended, unlike with warfarin. The other interesting recommendation is to continue aspirin through the surgery because of little, if any, increase in bleeding. — Michael J. Arnold, MD, Assistant Medical Editor.
