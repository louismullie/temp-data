## Question

What diagnostic evaluation is appropriate for a chronic vaper with nonspecific chest pain?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about appropriate diagnostic evaluation for a chronic vaper with nonspecific chest pain. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the initial assessment and risk stratification, including a focused chest pain and vaping history. Then, I should verify immediate triage criteria and core tests such as ECG, high-sensitivity troponin, pulse oximetry, and chest imaging. Next, I will map decision pathways for cardiac versus EVALI etiologies, followed by indications for advanced imaging, laboratory workup, and specialist consultation. After that, I must determine disposition thresholds, initial management including corticosteroids and antimicrobials when appropriate, and follow-up planning with vaccination and relapse prevention. Finally, I will ensure documentation, reporting, and cessation counseling are explicitly integrated into the plan [^1167Fmeu] [^114miqfu].

> Let me first confirm the essentials of history-taking. I need to characterize the chest pain precisely for quality, location, radiation, duration, triggers, and alleviating factors; importantly, I should avoid the term "atypical" and instead classify pain as cardiac, possibly cardiac, or noncardiac because "atypical" can be misleading and unsafe, especially early in the evaluation. I also need to elicit a nonjudgmental, detailed vaping history: nicotine versus THC, product source and brand, delivery method (including aerosolization, dabbing, or dripping), frequency, duration, and time of last use, since THC products from informal sources have been particularly implicated. I should also ask about respiratory symptoms (cough, dyspnea, hemoptysis), gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) that may precede lung findings, and constitutional symptoms (fever, chills, weight loss) to align with EVALI presentations [^111o6SQd] [^115X89PZ].

> Hold on, I should verify cardiac and noncardiac risk factors that influence pretest probability. I need to check for age, hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, tobacco use, family history of premature CAD, prior cardiac disease, and stimulant use (cocaine or methamphetamine), because these materially change the risk for ACS and influence testing strategy; I should also think about other dangerous causes such as PE and aortic syndromes based on history and exam features [^11764TxU] [^1167Fmeu].

> Next, I will examine the patient with attention to vital signs and oxygenation. I need to ensure pulse oximetry is obtained because an O2 saturation less than 95% is a key admission threshold in suspected EVALI; I should look for tachycardia, tachypnea, fever, and signs of respiratory distress. I will also perform careful cardiopulmonary auscultation and examine for chest wall tenderness, while keeping in mind that musculoskeletal tenderness does not exclude serious pathology in isolation [^112eBsZf] [^115X89PZ].

> I should confirm triage priorities now. Unstable or high-risk features such as hypoxemia, hemodynamic instability, dynamic ECG changes, or ongoing severe chest pain require immediate escalation of care and monitoring; if the patient is stable, I can continue the structured workup while maintaining vigilance for deterioration [^115LJqAN] [^1167Fmeu].

> I will now obtain core diagnostic tests for all such presentations. An immediate 12-lead ECG is essential to evaluate for ischemia or arrhythmia; high-sensitivity cardiac troponin should be measured with attention to timing from symptom onset because, when very low or undetectable at an appropriate interval, a single hs-cTn can reliably rule out NSTEMI, though serial testing is appropriate if timing is uncertain or values are borderline. I should double-check that persistent or recurrent symptoms warrant repeat ECGs and troponins to improve sensitivity [^1167Fmeu] [^113SsAv4].

> Let me verify pulmonary imaging next. A chest radiograph should be obtained in any vaper with respiratory, GI, or constitutional symptoms; I am watching for infiltrates, consolidation, pneumothorax, or pneumomediastinum, and I must remember that early EVALI can have a normal or nondiagnostic CXR, which means I should not falsely reassure myself if suspicion remains high. While I initially think of "bilateral ground-glass opacities" as a classic imaging phrase, I should correct myself that this terminology is most precise for CT; on CXR I will look for bilateral airspace disease or interstitial changes, recognizing CT may show ground-glass even when CXR is nonrevealing. I should also palpate the chest wall to evaluate for costochondritis if pain is reproducible and pleuritic, and consider pneumothorax given case reports associating vaping with barotrauma [^111BXeQB] [^113j7KKi] [^117DtUWw].

> Now I need to determine the primary diagnostic pathway. If cardiac suspicion is high based on typical features, risk profile, abnormal ECG, or positive troponin, I should channel the AHA/ACC chest pain guideline's risk-based testing approach: consider exercise ECG or CCTA for low risk; stress imaging or CCTA with FFR-CT for intermediate risk; and invasive coronary angiography for high risk. I need to ensure that testing selection matches pretest probability and local expertise to avoid over- or under-testing [^1177vooc] [^11336juV] [^115SoHBr].

> But wait, what if EVALI is strongly suspected. I should confirm three elements for this diagnosis of exclusion: a vaping history within the prior 90 days, pulmonary infiltrates on imaging, and no better alternative explanation after appropriate evaluation for infection, PE, cardiac failure, and other causes. I need to remember that EVALI can mimic infectious or inflammatory lung injury and can co-occur with respiratory infections, which means I must not jump to conclusions without excluding common alternatives [^1134Pcvn] [^113ZUfmh].

> Next, I should review indications for advanced imaging and targeted consultations. If the CXR is normal but clinical suspicion for EVALI remains high, or if I need to characterize abnormalities or complications, I should obtain a chest CT; I must use PE-protocol CTA if clinical probability for PE is high. On CT for EVALI, I should look for diffuse or lower-lobe predominant ground-glass opacities with or without consolidation, often with subpleural or lobular sparing, and be aware of less common but more specific signs such as upper-lobe centrilobular nodules or peribronchovascular sparing. I should consult pulmonology for suspected EVALI, cardiology if cardiac testing is abnormal or suspicion remains high, and addiction medicine early for cessation support [^111BXeQB] [^112xSWzQ] [^115vC1G4].

> I will now examine the laboratory workup to support or exclude alternatives. I need to check a CBC with differential, CMP, and targeted infectious testing including influenza during flu season and SARS-CoV-2 when indicated, and I should consider bronchoscopy with BAL in severe disease, in ICU care, or when infection must be excluded before initiating corticosteroids. I should confirm that starting steroids without excluding fungal disease could worsen outcomes; thus, timing of steroids may need to wait for critical infectious evaluations when risk for fungal pneumonia is nontrivial [^111BXeQB] [^116hHYeD] [^111TurUP].

> Hold on, I should verify disposition thresholds carefully. Admission is indicated for O2 saturation less than 95% on room air, respiratory distress or increased work of breathing, significant comorbidities that reduce pulmonary reserve, hemodynamic instability, or high-risk cardiac features requiring monitoring; outpatient management can be considered only if the patient is stable with O2 saturation 95% or greater, has no respiratory distress or concerning comorbidities, and can reliably follow up within 24–48 hours with strict return precautions because early deterioration can occur [^112eBsZf] [^116hHYeD].

> I need to ensure initial management is aligned with severity and differential. Immediate cessation of all vaping is essential; oxygen should be titrated to maintain saturation at or above 95%. If EVALI is suspected and infection has been reasonably excluded or balanced with appropriate coverage, systemic corticosteroids may be beneficial, ideally after pulmonology input on dosing and taper, while remembering the uncertainty around natural history and the potential to worsen unrecognized fungal disease. Empiric antimicrobials, including antivirals in influenza season, should be considered when co-infection risk is present or cannot be promptly excluded [^111TurUP] [^112fxVnj].

> Next, I should review follow-up and longitudinal care to prevent relapse and capture late effects. Within 1–2 weeks after discharge or initial outpatient management, I should reassess clinically with pulse oximetry and consider repeat CXR; at 1–2 months, spirometry and DLCO can help assess residual impairment, with repeat imaging if abnormalities persist. I must counsel that relapse can occur during corticosteroid tapers or with resumption of vaping, and some patients may need home oxygen and extended pulmonary follow-up. Vaccination with annual influenza and age- and risk-appropriate pneumococcal vaccines should be emphasized given overlapping respiratory risks and uncertain long-term vulnerability after EVALI [^114miqfu] [^112evvxW].

> I should double-check that documentation, communication, and public health steps are not overlooked. I need to document a detailed vaping exposure assessment, counseling provided, and cessation resources offered, and I should avoid premature closure by attributing pain solely to benign causes without evaluating for both cardiac pathology and EVALI. Suspected EVALI cases should be reported to local or state health departments per public health guidance, and evidence-based cessation strategies, including behavioral counseling and FDA-approved medications, should be arranged or referred as part of discharge planning [^115X89PZ] [^1137PREg] [^112evvxW].

> Let me summarize the practical algorithm to ensure nothing is missed. For all chronic vapers with chest pain, I should obtain ECG, high-sensitivity troponin, pulse oximetry, and a chest radiograph up front; if oxygen saturation is less than 95% or imaging is abnormal, admit, initiate EVALI workup, and consult pulmonology. If stable with oxygen saturation 95% or greater, I will risk-stratify for cardiac versus pulmonary versus other causes; pursue guideline-directed cardiac testing when features suggest ischemia and, when EVALI features are present, exclude infection, consider steroids with appropriate safeguards, and ensure very close follow-up while delivering robust cessation counseling and vaccination updates [^1167Fmeu] [^111BXeQB] [^112eBsZf].

For chronic vaping with vague chest pain, start with a **focused history and exam** to characterize pain, quantify vaping exposure, and assess cardiovascular risk [^1167Fmeu] [^114miqfu]. Obtain an **ECG and troponin**, plus CBC, CMP, CRP/ESR, and spirometry with DLCO; add D-dimer if PE is suspected. Obtain a **chest X-ray** for all patients, and use **chest CT** if symptoms persist or worsen to assess for EVALI, pneumothorax, or bullous disease [^111BXeQB] [^112xSWzQ]. Use echocardiography or stress testing if cardiac ischemia is suspected, and consider bronchoscopy with BAL if infection or alternative diagnoses remain unclear. Emphasize **vaping cessation**, arrange close follow-up, and escalate care for hypoxemia or respiratory distress [^111BXeQB] [^114miqfu].

---

## Clinical history and physical examination

A **focused clinical history and physical examination** are essential to characterize chest pain, quantify vaping exposure, and identify cardiovascular and pulmonary risk factors.

- **Chest pain characterization**: Onset, duration, location, radiation, intensity, quality, aggravating and relieving factors, and associated symptoms (dyspnea, cough, fever, gastrointestinal symptoms) [^1167Fmeu] [^114xXuB7].

- **Vaping history**: Duration, frequency, type of devices, substances used (nicotine, THC, CBD, flavorings), source of products, and recent changes in vaping habits.

- **Cardiovascular risk assessment**: Hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, family history of coronary artery disease, and other traditional risk factors [^1167Fmeu].

- **Physical examination**: Vital signs, pulse oximetry, cardiovascular and respiratory examination, including assessment for signs of respiratory distress, hypoxemia, or abnormal lung sounds [^115X89PZ].

---

## Initial diagnostic testing

Initial diagnostic testing should focus on **excluding life-threatening conditions** and identifying potential vaping-related lung injury.

- **Electrocardiogram (ECG)**: To exclude acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or other cardiac abnormalities [^114xXuB7].

- **Cardiac biomarkers**: High-sensitivity troponin to exclude myocardial injury.

- **Basic laboratory tests**: Complete blood count (CBC), comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), inflammatory markers (CRP, ESR), and D-dimer if pulmonary embolism is suspected.

- **Pulmonary function tests (PFTs)**: Spirometry with diffusion capacity (DLCO) to assess for obstructive or restrictive lung disease and impaired gas exchange.

---

## Imaging studies

Imaging studies are **critical** in evaluating vaping-related lung injury and excluding other pulmonary conditions. Obtain a **chest radiograph (CXR)** as the initial study to evaluate for pulmonary infiltrates, pneumothorax, or other abnormalities [^111BXeQB], and use **chest computed tomography (CT)** if symptoms persist or worsen or if the CXR is abnormal. CT findings in vaping-related lung injury (EVALI) include bilateral ground-glass opacities, organizing pneumonia, diffuse alveolar damage, and occasionally pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum [^112xSWzQ].

---

## Advanced diagnostic testing

Advanced **diagnostic testing** may be necessary if initial evaluations are inconclusive or if specific conditions are suspected. Use transthoracic echocardiography to evaluate cardiac function, valvular disease, or pericardial effusion when cardiac involvement is suspected [^1141H6C8]. If myocardial ischemia is suspected, perform cardiac stress testing with exercise ECG or stress imaging (echocardiography, PET/SPECT, or cardiac MRI) [^11336juV]. Consider bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage when infection, eosinophilic pneumonia, or other alternative diagnoses are suspected.

---

## Differential diagnosis

The **differential diagnosis** for chronic vaping-associated chest pain includes:

- **Vaping-related lung injury (EVALI)**: Bilateral ground-glass opacities, organizing pneumonia, diffuse alveolar damage [^112xSWzQ].

- **Pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum**: Associated with vaping, particularly THC-containing products [^111BXeQB].

- **Bronchial hyperreactivity or asthma-like symptoms**: Common in chronic vapers.

- **Cardiac ischemia or myocarditis**: Rare but possible, particularly in patients with cardiovascular risk factors.

- **Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)**: Common non-cardiac cause of chest pain.

---

## Management and follow-up

Management and follow-up focus on **vaping cessation** to prevent further lung injury and symptom recurrence, with supportive care such as oxygen therapy, bronchodilators, and corticosteroids when indicated. Monitor symptoms, pulmonary function, and imaging findings at close follow-up, and provide education on vaping risks and the importance of cessation.

---

## Indications for specialist referral

Indications for **specialist referral** include persistent or worsening symptoms despite initial evaluation and management, abnormal imaging or pulmonary function tests suggesting significant lung injury, and suspected or confirmed cardiac involvement. Referral is also appropriate for complex cases requiring multidisciplinary management.

---

A **structured approach** to chronic vaping with vague chest pain includes a focused history and physical examination; initial diagnostic testing and imaging studies; advanced diagnostic testing; a clear differential diagnosis; and management with follow-up. This approach helps identify vaping-related lung injury and other potential causes, guiding appropriate management and specialist referral.

Previous literature has suggested that imaging findings in patients with EVALI may result from a broad range of underlying pathologic mechanisms. The results presented in this paper confirm that most patients with EVALI have CT imaging findings along a spectrum ranging from organizing pneumonia to diffuse alveolar damage, which can mimic causes of acute lung injury because of various causes. These include diffuse or lower lobe predominant ground-glass opacity with or without consolidation that may demonstrate areas of subpleural or lobular sparing. As such, vaping exposure should be included in the clinical history of all patients with CT findings of acute lung injury without another known cause, particularly if they are young and otherwise healthy. Furthermore, some patients in this EVALI cohort demonstrated CT findings less commonly seen in other etiologies of acute lung injury, including superimposed upper lobe predominant centrilobular nodules and peribronchovascular sparing. When these findings are present in conjunction with the more typically seen manifestations of acute lung injury, suspicion for EVALI should be elevated.

Health care providers should emphasize the importance of annual influenza vaccination for all persons aged ≥ 6 months, including their patients who use e-cigarette or vaping products. It is not known whether patients with EVALI are at higher risk for severe complications of influenza or other respiratory infections. In addition, administration of pneumococcal vaccine should be considered for patients with a history of EVALI, according to guidelines.

- **Postdischarge follow-up**: Patients discharged from the hospital after inpatient treatment for EVALI should have a follow-up visit within 1–2 weeks. The follow-up evaluation should include pulse-oximetry and consideration of a repeat CXR. Additional follow-up testing 1–2 months after discharge might include spirometry, diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide, and CXR.

Long-term effects and the risk for recurrence of EVALI are not known. Whereas many patients' symptoms resolved, clinicians report that some patients have relapsed during corticosteroid tapers or with resumption of e-cigarette or vaping product use after hospitalization, underscoring the need for cessation and close follow-up. Some patients have had persistent hypoxemia requiring home oxygen at discharge and might require ongoing pulmonary follow-up. Patients treated with high-dose corticosteroids might require care from an endocrinologist to monitor adrenal function.

Health care providers should also advise patients with a history of EVALI to return for ongoing evaluation to manage potential relapses or complications effectively.

Radiographic findings consistent with EVALI include pulmonary infiltrates on chest X-rays (CXR) and opacities on chest computed tomography (CT) scans. A CXR should be obtained for all patients with a history of e-cigarette or vaping product use who exhibit respiratory or gastrointestinal symptoms, particularly when accompanied by decreased O2 saturation (< 95%). A chest CT might be useful when the CXR result does not correlate with clinical findings or to evaluate severe or worsening disease; complications such as pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum; or other illnesses in the differential diagnosis, such as pneumonia or pulmonary embolism. In some cases, a chest CT has demonstrated findings such as bilateral ground glass opacities despite a normal or nondiagnostic CXR. Among patients with abnormal CXR findings and a clinical picture consistent with EVALI, a chest CT scan might not be necessary for diagnosis. The decision to obtain a chest CT should be made on a case-by-case basis depending on the clinical circumstances.

- **Consultation with specialists**: Consultation with several specialists might be necessary to optimize patient management. For patients being evaluated for possible EVALI, consideration should be given to consulting with a pulmonologist who can help guide further evaluation, recommend empiric treatment, and review the indications for bronchoscopy. The decision to perform bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) to rule out alternative diagnoses, such as pulmonary infection, should be made on a case-by-case basis.

### Reporting of pneumothorax in association with vaping devices and electronic cigarettes [^117DtUWw]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

In October 2019, a 34-year-old white male presented to his general practitioner with a one-day history of back pain, shortness of breath, tightness in his chest, burning pain in his right chest, retrosternal pain, and dizziness. Symptoms started after minor exertion during the afternoon on the day before presentation.

His medical history was noteworthy only for a few rib fractures on his right side sustained in a cycling accident three years ago. There was no family history of lung disease. As a trained nurse, he worked in outpatient palliative care and devoted his free time to strength training and competitive sports. Due to his occupation, he had regular health checks, all of which were negative for infectious diseases. He had no recent sports trauma to his chest. Despite being an active and internationally successful athlete, he smoked 20 cigarettes per day from the age of 21 years to 31 years. Three years ago, he quit smoking by switching to vaping nicotine. He never smoked or vaped cannabis, and he reported a pattern of regular deep and slow inhalation with the vaping device throughout the day similar to smoking a pack of cigarettes.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for chest pain, specifically in relation to the evaluation for non-ischemic cardiac causes such as valvular heart disease, the 2021 ACC/AHA/ASE/SAEM/SCCT/SCMR guidelines recommend considering a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE). This is suggested for determining the presence, severity, and cause of valvular heart disease in patients presenting with acute chest pain who have a suspected or known history of valvular heart disease.

### Update: Interim guidance for health care providers for managing patients with suspected e-cigarette, or vaping, product use-associated lung injury - United States, November 2019 [^115swexB]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2019). Low credibility.

Health care providers should ask about the use of e-cigarette or vaping products in a confidential and nonjudgmental manner when evaluating patients with respiratory symptoms (e.g. cough, chest pain, and shortness of breath), gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g. abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea), or constitutional symptoms (e.g. fever, chills, and weight loss). Confidentiality is essential when assessing sensitive information, including all forms of substance use, especially among adolescents and young adults. Empathetic, nonjudgmental, and private questioning of patients should be employed to encourage truthful disclosure.

The most critical step in assessing EVALI is to ask patients about recent use of e-cigarette or vaping products. If confirmed, the types of substances used (e.g. tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and nicotine) and where they were obtained should be ascertained. Evidence at the time of writing implicates products containing THC, particularly those obtained from informal sources like friends, family members, or in-person or online dealers.

- **Algorithm for management of patients with symptoms**:
	- Respiratory, gastrointestinal, or constitutional symptoms and e-cigarette or vaping product use. Abbreviations include: CT (computed tomography); EVALI (e-cigarette, or vaping, product use–associated lung injury).

- **Assessment of recent history of use**:
	- The most critical step involves gathering information on the use of e-cigarette or vaping products.

### Pitfalls in evaluating the low-risk chest pain patient [^115PLUvA]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

Risk stratification and management of the patient with low-risk chest pain continues to be challenging despite the considerable effort of numerous investigators. Evidence exists that a specific subset of young patients can be defined as low risk in whom further testing may not be necessary. A high index of suspicion of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and an understanding of the many, subtle, and atypical presentations of ischemic heart disease are required. The initial history, electrocardiogram (ECG), and biomarkers are important, but serial ECGs and biomarkers improve sensitivity in detecting ACS. Unless chest pain is clearly explained, objective testing, such as exercise treadmill testing, nuclear scintigraphy, stress echocardiography, or coronary computed tomography angiogram, should be considered before, or soon after, discharge.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for chest pain, specifically with respect to history and physical examination, the ACC/ACCP/AHA/ASE/SAEM/SCCT/SCMR 2021 guidelines recommend assessing for cocaine and methamphetamine use in patients presenting with acute chest pain.

Admission criteria and outpatient management. Several factors should be considered when deciding whether to admit a patient with potential EVALI to the hospital. Among 1,002 cases reported to the CDC with available data as of October 8, 96% of patients were hospitalized. Patients with suspected EVALI should be admitted if they have decreased O₂ saturation (< 95%) on room air, are in respiratory distress, or have comorbidities that compromise pulmonary reserve. Consider modifying factors such as altitude to guide the interpretation of measured O₂ saturation.

- **Management of patients with suspected e-cigarette or vaping product use associated lung injury (EVALI)**: Outpatient management of suspected EVALI might be considered on a case-by-case basis for patients who are clinically stable, have less severe injury, and for whom follow-up within 24–48 hours of initial evaluation can be assured. Candidates for outpatient management should have normal O₂ saturation (≥ 95%), reliable access to care, and strong social support systems.

	- For these patients, empiric use of antimicrobials, including antivirals if indicated, should be considered. Some patients who initially had mild symptoms experienced a rapid worsening of symptoms within 48 hours. In Illinois and Wisconsin, 72% of patients had either an outpatient or emergency department visit before seeking additional medical care that resulted in hospital admission. Health care providers should instruct all patients to seek medical care promptly if respiratory symptoms worsen.

The CDC, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), state and local health departments, along with public health and clinical partners, are investigating a multistate outbreak of lung injury associated with the use of electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) or vaping products. In late August, the CDC released recommendations for health care providers regarding e-cigarette, or vaping, product use associated lung injury (EVALI) based on limited data from the first reported cases.

This report summarizes national surveillance data describing clinical features of more recently reported cases and interim recommendations based on these data for U.S. health care providers caring for patients with suspected or known EVALI. It provides interim guidance for:

- **Initial clinical evaluation**: Health care providers should thoroughly and nonjudgmentally ask about the use of e-cigarette or vaping products.

- **Suggested criteria for hospital admission and treatment**: A chest radiograph (CXR) is recommended for patients suspected to have EVALI. Hospital admission is recommended for patients with decreased blood oxygen (O2) saturation (less than 95%) on room air or respiratory distress.

- **Patient follow-up**: Ongoing monitoring is essential to manage patient recovery effectively.

- **Special considerations for groups at high risk**: Certain groups might require additional clinical oversight.

- **Clinical and public health recommendations**: Empiric use of a combination of antibiotics, antivirals, or steroids should be considered based upon clinical context. Evidence-based tobacco product cessation strategies, including behavioral counseling, are recommended to assist patients.

This guidance aims to assist health care providers in evaluating and caring for patients with suspected or known EVALI effectively.

### Usefulness of 64-slice multidetector computed tomography as an initial diagnostic approach in patients with acute chest pain [^11476RoR]. American Heart Journal (2008). Low credibility.

Recently, multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) has been proposed as an accurate diagnostic tool to evaluate coronary artery disease. However, the role of MDCT as part of the initial diagnostic process for evaluating acute chest pain is less well established.

- **Methods**: We prospectively enrolled patients presenting with acute chest pain to the emergency department (ED) and risk stratified them based on the pretest probability for an acute coronary syndrome (ACS): (1) very low, (2) low, (3) intermediate, (4) high, and (5) very high or definite. After exclusion of very low and very high-risk patients, 268 patients were randomized to either immediate 64-slice cardiac MDCT or a conventional diagnostic strategy. The number of admissions, ED and hospital length of stay (LOS), and major adverse cardiac events over 30 days of follow-up were compared between the strategies based on the pretest probability for ACS.

- **Results**: The number of patients ultimately diagnosed with an ACS did not differ between the two strategies. Emergency department LOS and total admissions were not different between strategies. Patients in the MDCT-based strategy had a decreased hospital LOS (P = 0.049) and fewer admissions deemed unnecessary (P = 0.007). Reductions in unnecessary admissions were more prominent in intermediate-risk patients (P = 0.015). None of the patients discharged from the ED in the MDCT-based strategy experienced major adverse cardiac events at follow-up.

- **Conclusion**: Use of an MDCT-based strategy in the ED as part of the initial diagnostic approach for patients presenting with acute chest pain can lead to better patient management without an increase in adverse events.

### Update: Interim guidance for health care providers for managing patients with suspected e-cigarette, or vaping, product use-associated lung injury - United States, November 2019 [^116Bgmee]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2019). Low credibility.

The CDC, Food and Drug Administration (FDA), state and local health departments, and public health and clinical stakeholders are investigating a nationwide outbreak of e-cigarette, or vaping, product use-associated lung injury (EVALI). The CDC has published recommendations for health care providers regarding EVALI. Recently, researchers from Utah and New York proposed diagnosis and treatment algorithms for EVALI. EVALI remains a diagnosis of exclusion as no specific test or marker exists, and evaluation should be guided by clinical judgment. Patients with EVALI might experience symptoms similar to those associated with influenza or other respiratory infections, such as fever, cough, headache, myalgias, or fatigue, making differentiation challenging. EVALI might also co-occur with respiratory infections.

This report summarizes recommendations for health care providers managing patients with suspected or known EVALI, particularly when respiratory infections like influenza are more prevalent. Recommendations include:

- **Ask patients about e-cigarette or vaping products**: Inquire with patients exhibiting respiratory, gastrointestinal, or constitutional symptoms.
- **Evaluate suspected EVALI cases**: Use pulse oximetry and obtain chest imaging as clinically indicated.
- **Consider outpatient management**: For clinically stable EVALI patients meeting specific criteria.
- **Test patients for influenza**, given the potential overlap of symptoms.

### Update: Interim guidance for health care professionals evaluating and caring for patients with suspected e-cigarette, or vaping, product use-associated lung injury and for reducing the risk for rehospitalization and death following hospital discharge - United States, December 2019 [^115pMfmb]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2020). Low credibility.

To develop this updated clinical guidance, the CDC reviewed new data on rehospitalization and death after hospital discharge and consulted with the Lung Injury Response Clinical Working Group regarding approaches to clinical management of suspected EVALI patients. Previous EVALI guidance has focused on:

- **Diagnosis**: Including obtaining an accurate history and conducting a physical examination that includes vital signs, pulmonary auscultation, and pulse oximetry; laboratory testing to rule out infectious etiologies; radiographic imaging; and consulting a specialist.
- **Inpatient and outpatient management**: Consideration of empiric administration of corticosteroids and antimicrobials, if indicated.
- **Follow-up after hospital admission**.
- **Considerations during the influenza season**.

This updated guidance highlights health care system best practices for EVALI patients that might improve care quality and reduce the risk for adverse outcomes, including rehospitalization and death. Best practices include carefully assessing clinical readiness for discharge, comprehensive discharge planning (e.g. follow-up with specialty care providers), and ensuring follow-up by a primary care or pulmonary specialist, optimally within 48 hours of hospital discharge.

### Frequency of chest pain in primary care, diagnostic tests performed and final diagnoses [^113qtuwg]. Heart (2017). Low credibility.

This observational study examines the incidence, referral rate, diagnostic tests, and agreement between working and final diagnoses for patients with chest pain in primary care.

Methods: A cohort of 118 general practitioners (GPs) in the Netherlands and Belgium recorded all patient contacts over a two-week period. Detailed registrations were made for patients presenting with chest pain, and follow-up forms were completed after 30 days.

Results: A total of 22,294 patient contacts were registered, with chest pain accounting for 281 cases (1.26%). The mean age for men was 54.4 years and for women, 53 years. In 38.1% of these patients, acute coronary syndrome (ACS) was temporarily suspected during consultations. Approximately 40.2% of the patients were referred to secondary care, and 512 diagnostic tests were executed by GPs and specialists. Musculoskeletal pain was the most frequent working diagnosis (26.1%) and final diagnosis (33.1%). Potentially life-threatening conditions, such as myocardial infarction, were confirmed in 8.4% of cases. There was a major difference between working and final diagnoses in 23.1% of cases, and in 0.7% of cases, a severe disease was initially missed by the GP.

Conclusion: Chest pain occurred in 281 patients (1.26% of all consultations), with most final diagnoses being non-life-threatening. However, life-threatening causes were identified in 8.4% of cases. The substantial number and variety of diagnostic tests performed by GPs and specialists reflect the careful (and often safe) overestimation of chest pain's potential seriousness.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for chest pain, specifically in the evaluation for ACS at intermediate risk, the ACC/ACCP/AHA/ASE/SAEM/SCCT/SCMR 2021 guidelines recommend considering stress imaging with PET/SPECT myocardial perfusion imaging, cardiac MRI, or stress echocardiography. This is particularly advised for intermediate-risk patients with acute chest pain and known coronary artery disease who are experiencing new onset or worsening symptoms.

### Stable atypical chest pain with negative anatomical or functional diagnostic test: Diagnosis no matter what or prevention at any cost [^116Ensqc]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Low credibility.

The results of the study indicate a varied distribution of patients based on the characteristics of their chest pain. Non-anginal pain was reported in 37% of cases, with a higher prevalence in women (43%) compared to men (30%). Atypical chest pain was present in 52% of cases, while typical chest pain accounted for 11%.

No functional or anatomical tests were performed on patients with non-anginal pain, and no cardiovascular events were recorded during the one-year follow-up in this group. Among the 372 patients with typical chest pain, coronary angiography was conducted, resulting in revascularization in 82% of these cases.

For the 1706 patients experiencing atypical chest pain, the pre-test probability (PPT) was calculated, and both functional and anatomical tests were performed to detect potential ischemia. The tests yielded positive results in 6% of patients with a PPT of 15% to 65%, and in 20% of those with a PPT of 66% to 85%. In total, this amounted to 170 patients, or 10%. These individuals subsequently underwent coronary angiography.

Furthermore, sixteen patients with atypical chest pain and negative functional tests were also subjected to coronary angiography. The results were negative in 14 patients, while two patients were diagnosed with non-obstructive coronary heart disease.

The study also stratified 1636 patients with negative functional or anatomical testing based on at least one risky lifestyle factor. It was found that 27% of these patients led non-risky lifestyles, whereas 73% had one or more risky lifestyle factors. During the one-year follow-up, 1% of this cohort (comprising 9 males and 6 females) experienced a coronary event. This included four sudden deaths, three non-fatal ST elevation myocardial infarctions (STEMIs), and eight non-fatal non-ST elevation myocardial infarctions.

### Update: Interim guidance for health care providers for managing patients with suspected e-cigarette, or vaping, product use-associated lung injury - United States, November 2019 [^116hHYeD]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2019). High credibility.

Consideration of outpatient management. Some patients with a recent history of e-cigarette or vaping product use who are evaluated for respiratory, gastrointestinal, or constitutional symptoms might be candidates for outpatient management. Hospital admission should be strongly considered for patients with concomitant illnesses such as influenza and suspected EVALI, especially if respiratory distress, comorbidities that compromise pulmonary reserve, or decreased oxygen saturation (< 95% while breathing room air) are present. Candidates for outpatient management should have normal oxygen saturation (≥ 95%), no respiratory distress, no comorbidities that might compromise pulmonary reserve, reliable access to care, strong social support systems, and should be able to ensure follow-up within 24–48 hours of initial evaluation and seek medical care promptly if respiratory symptoms worsen. In some cases, patients who initially had mild symptoms experienced a rapid worsening of symptoms within 48 hours. Additional follow-up might be indicated based on clinical findings.

- **Influenza testing and empiric antimicrobial treatment**: Influenza testing should be strongly considered, particularly during the influenza season. It might be difficult to differentiate EVALI, a diagnosis of exclusion, from influenza or community-acquired pneumonia on initial assessment, and EVALI might co-occur with respiratory infections. Treatment with empiric antimicrobials, including antivirals, should be considered in accordance with established guidelines and local microbiology and resistance patterns for bacterial infections.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for chest pain, more specifically with respect to the evaluation of stable chest pain (INOCA), the ACC/ACCP/AHA/ASE/SAEM/SCCT/SCMR 2021 guidelines recommend considering cardiac MRI with the addition of myocardial blood flow reserve measurement. This approach can improve the diagnosis of coronary microvascular dysfunction and assist in estimating the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events in patients with persistent stable chest pain and nonobstructive coronary artery disease.

### Update: Interim guidance for health care providers evaluating and caring for patients with suspected e-cigarette, or vaping, product use associated lung injury - United States, October 2019 [^113ZUfmh]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2019). Low credibility.

As of October 8, 2019, 49 states, the District of Columbia, and one territorial health department have reported 1,299 cases of EVALI to the CDC, with 26 deaths reported from 21 states (median age of death = 49 years, range = 17–75 years). Among 1,043 patients with available data on age and sex, 70% were male, and the median age was 24 years (range = 13–75 years); 80% were aged < 35 years, and 15% were aged < 18 years. Among 573 patients who reported information on substances used in e-cigarette or vaping products in the 90 days preceding symptom onset, 76% reported using THC-containing products, and 58% reported using nicotine-containing products. Additionally, 32% reported exclusive use of THC-containing products while 13% reported exclusive use of nicotine-containing products.

No single compound or ingredient has emerged as the cause of these injuries at the time of writing, and there might be more than one cause. Available data suggest THC-containing products play a role in this outbreak, but the specific chemical or chemicals responsible for EVALI have not yet been identified, and nicotine-containing products have not been excluded as a possible cause.

Ongoing federal and state investigations have provided information about the clinical characteristics of cases. A surveillance case definition for confirmed and probable cases has been developed; however, this case definition is not intended to guide clinical care. To inform the CDC's updated interim clinical guidance, on October 2, 2019, the CDC obtained individual expert perspectives on the evaluation and treatment of patients with suspected EVALI.

EVALI is considered a diagnosis of exclusion because, at present, no specific test or marker exists for its diagnosis. Health care providers should consider multiple etiologies, including the possibility of EVALI and concomitant infection. In addition, health care providers should evaluate alternative diagnoses as suggested by clinical findings and medical history, such as cardiac, gastrointestinal, rheumatologic, and neoplastic processes, as well as environmental or occupational exposures or causes of acute respiratory distress syndrome.

- **Clinical evaluation**: For patients with a recent history of using e-cigarette, or vaping, products and suspected lung injury, patient history is crucial. Based on medical chart abstraction data submitted to the CDC, 95% (323/339) of patients diagnosed with EVALI initially experienced respiratory symptoms, such as cough, chest pain, and shortness of breath. Additionally, 77% (262/339) had gastrointestinal symptoms, including abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. In some patients, gastrointestinal symptoms preceded respiratory symptoms. Respiratory or gastrointestinal symptoms were accompanied by constitutional symptoms such as fever, chills, and weight loss among 85% (289/339) of patients.

- **Table**: Characteristics of patients (N = 342) with e-cigarette use, or vaping, product use-associated lung injury (EVALI), as derived from national EVALI surveillance reports to the CDC in the United States, 2019.

### Overview of pathologic findings of vaping in the context of an autopsy patient with chronic injury [^112qmotJ]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Electronic cigarettes are handheld devices that heat an inner liquid containing chemicals to be aerosolized and inhaled. They have become a popular alternative to conventional cigarettes. Their use, termed vaping, has been linked to severe injury, with 2,711 cases of associated lung injury and 60 deaths reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention at the time of writing. Published case reports and series have emerged detailing clinical and imaging characteristics of vaping-induced lung injury. However, the pathologic characteristics of these induced injuries are still being established, particularly findings occurring over time.

The objective of this study is to illustrate the autopsy findings of an older patient who died of vaping-induced injury after prolonged symptomology and to provide a review of the most recent literature regarding the basic science, epidemiology, clinical presentation, imaging characteristics, and pathology of vaping-induced lung injury.

Data sources include autopsy cases and peer-reviewed literature.

Conclusions drawn from this research suggest that vaping-induced lung injury has emerged as a public health issue, and this case represents a rare opportunity to evaluate this issue at autopsy. Most commonly, the injury has been attributed to tetrahydrocannabinol product use rather than nicotine. This case demonstrates that as today's young and relatively healthy "vapers" grow older and develop the comorbidities that come with advanced age, there is serious risk of chronic lung damage from vaping that could result in death. Further observations and studies, particularly autopsy evidence, are needed.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for chest pain, specifically in the evaluation for acute coronary syndrome (ACS) at intermediate risk, the 2021 guidelines from the ACC, ACCP, AHA, ASE, SAEM, SCCT, and SCMR recommend considering the use of fractional flow reserve (FFR) obtained with computed tomography (CT) to diagnose vessel-specific ischemia. This approach helps guide decision-making regarding coronary revascularization in intermediate-risk patients with acute chest pain and no known coronary artery disease, particularly those with coronary artery stenosis of 40–90% in a proximal or middle coronary artery as detected on coronary CTA.

### A rare case of acute eosinophilic pneumonia induced by vaping-associated lung injury: A case report [^116Kkuk8]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Low credibility.

AEP is a rare and serious condition characterized by a nonproductive cough, dyspnea, and fever that typically present in less than four weeks. Currently, the modified Philit criteria is used to diagnose AEP and includes the following: an acute respiratory illness for less than or equal to one month in duration; pulmonary infiltrates seen in chest X-ray (CXR) or computed tomography (CT); more than 25% eosinophils in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid; and the absence of other known causes of pulmonary eosinophilia. These criteria were entirely observed in our patient, who had a BAL of 84% eosinophils.

Patients typically present with a normal peripheral blood eosinophil level, which can rise afterward. This was the case in our patient; at initial presentation, the peripheral blood eosinophil level was 2.3%, and after four days, it rose to 14.5%. The differential diagnosis for AEP includes eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, hypereosinophilic syndrome, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, pulmonary fungal and parasitic infections, and medication-induced causes. It is crucial to consider all these differential diagnoses, which were ruled out in our patient before confirming the diagnosis of AEP.

While the disease can be idiopathic, a well-known entity of AEP occurs following exposure to new inhalants, mostly in first-time cigarette smokers, firefighters exposed to high concentrations of World Trade Center dust, military service personnel in the Middle East, and lately in vape users. Our patient denied encountering such exposures.

Confidentiality is essential when assessing sensitive information, including all forms of substance use, especially for young adults and adolescents. Empathetic, nonjudgmental, and private questioning of patients to encourage truthful disclosure should be employed. Repeat questioning might elicit additional information about exposures, as trust is established.

The strongest evidence at the time of writing implicates products containing tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), particularly those obtained from informal sources like friends, family members, or in-person or online dealers. Therefore, it is important to ascertain the following information:

- **Types of substances used**: THC or cannabis [specify if oil or dabs], nicotine, modified products or the addition of substances (e.g. addition of vitamin E acetate).
- **Product source**
- **Product brand and name**
- **Duration and frequency of use**
- **Time of last use**
- **Product delivery system**
- **Method of use**: Aerosolization, dabbing, or dripping.

The physical exam should include assessment of vital signs and pulse oximetry; tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypoxemia have been commonly reported among cases.

Laboratory testing should be guided by clinical findings to evaluate multiple etiologies, including the possibility of EVALI and concomitant infection. A chest radiograph (CXR) should be considered.

### Chest pain: when in doubt [^116PdE1V]. Heart (2020). Low credibility.

A 38-year-old Caucasian man presented with central chest heaviness at rest. He had a history of mild abdominal discomfort but no infective prodrome, antecedent exertional, or nocturnal chest pain. The patient had a 26-pack-year history of tobacco smoking and no known comorbidities. Recent social history was unremarkable. Examination and vital signs were normal. An ECG taken with mild residual chest discomfort is shown in Figure 1A. High-sensitivity troponin I was 74 ng/L, peaking at 1405 ng/L. Echocardiography demonstrated a structurally normal heart with normal biventricular function. Medical therapy for an acute coronary syndrome was commenced, and invasive coronary angiography was performed (Figure 1B, C).

### Update: Characteristics of patients in a national outbreak of e-cigarette, or vaping, product use-associated lung injuries - United States, October 2019 [^112Prp1h]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2019). Low credibility.

Among the 29 EVALI-associated deaths reported to the CDC as of October 15, 2019, 59% (17) were male; the median age was 45 years (range = 17–75 years) overall, 55 years (range = 17–71 years) among males, and 43 years (range = 27–75 years) among females. The age difference between males and females was not statistically significant (p = 0.5). Patients who died were older than patients who survived (p < 0.01).

- **Substance use data**: Among 19 EVALI patients who died and for whom data on substance use was available, the use of any THC-containing products was reported by patients or proxies for 84% (16), including 63% (12) who exclusively used THC-containing products. Use of any nicotine-containing products was reported for 37% (seven), including 16% (three) who exclusively used nicotine-containing products. Use of both THC- and nicotine-containing products was reported in four decedents.

Note: Data on both THC- and nicotine-containing product use were required to be included.

### Is the initial diagnostic impression of "noncardiac chest pain" adequate to exclude cardiac disease [^1163qxFy]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2004). High credibility.

In patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with an initial diagnostic impression of noncardiac chest pain, we determined the 30-day incidence of adverse cardiac events and characteristics associated with those events.

- **Methods**: The multicenter, prospectively collected Internet Tracking Registry for Acute Coronary Syndromes (i*tr ACS) registry of patients with chest pain, enrolled from June 1, 1999, to August 1, 2001, was reviewed. We included patients if the physician's initial diagnostic impression was noncardiac chest pain after the medical history, physical examination, and initial 12-lead ECG. ED records, inpatient records, and follow-up results were reviewed for evidence of an adverse cardiac event defined as ST-segment or non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, unstable angina, revascularization, or cardiac death within 30 days.

- **Results**: Of 17,737 patients enrolled in i*tr ACS, 2,992 had an initial emergency physician impression of noncardiac chest pain. Of these, 85 (2.8%) patients had definite evidence for an adverse cardiac event. The adverse cardiac event group was older (61.2 versus 47.9 years), more likely to be men (58.6% versus 38.7%), and had a higher Acute Cardiac Ischemia-Time Insensitive Predictive Instrument score (26.1 versus 15.6). Factors associated with adverse cardiac events included hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, history of coronary artery disease, and history of congestive heart failure.

- **Conclusion**: When the initial impression is noncardiac chest pain, high-risk features such as traditional cardiovascular risk factors should be carefully evaluated.

Regarding the diagnostic investigations for chest pain, particularly in the context of evaluating acute coronary syndrome (ACS) at intermediate risk, the 2021 guidelines from ACC, ACCP, AHA, ASE, SAEM, SCCT, and SCMR recommend considering coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA). This is advised to assess the progression of atherosclerotic plaque and obstructive coronary artery disease in intermediate-risk patients with acute chest pain who have known nonobstructive coronary artery disease.

Early initiation of antimicrobial treatment for community-acquired pneumonia in accordance with established guidelines should be strongly considered, given the overlapping signs and symptoms in these conditions. During influenza season, health care providers should consider influenza in all patients with suspected EVALI and antivirals should be considered in accordance with established guidelines. Decisions on initiation or discontinuation of treatment should be based on specific clinical features and, when appropriate, in consultation with specialists.

- **Follow-up from hospital admission**: Patients discharged from the hospital after inpatient treatment for EVALI should have a follow-up visit no later than 1–2 weeks after discharge that includes pulse-oximetry, and clinicians should consider repeating the CXR. Additional follow-up testing 1–2 months after discharge, that might include spirometry, diffusion capacity testing, and CXR, should be considered. Long-term effects and the risk of recurrence of EVALI are not known. Whereas many patients' symptoms resolved, clinicians report that some patients have relapsed during corticosteroid tapers after hospitalization, underscoring the need for close follow-up (personal communication, Lung Injury Response Clinical Working Group, October 2, 2019). Some patients have had persistent hypoxemia (O2 saturation < 95%), requiring home oxygen at discharge and might need ongoing pulmonary follow-up. Patients treated with high-dose corticosteroids might require care from an endocrinologist to monitor adrenal function.

### Stable atypical chest pain with negative anatomical or functional diagnostic test: Diagnosis no matter what or prevention at any cost [^114CUsLc]. Clinical cardiology (2019). Low credibility.

Patients with stable atypical pain and an intermediate pre-test probability (PPT) present a challenge for clinicians. In these patients, there is a residual risk of about 1% for fatal and non-fatal events, which can hardly be reduced even with the most sophisticated diagnostic tests.

These patients represent a high risk for physicians due to the significant medical-legal implications that can follow when an event occurs. The doctor has two choices:

- **Engage in diagnostics**: Get involved in very expensive and often useless diagnostic procedures since they do not modify the patient's prognosis.

- **Modify lifestyle**: Try to modify the risk factors and, above all, the lifestyles, leading to a clear improvement of the prognosis. As demonstrated in our study, the events were at 1.2% in patients with risky lifestyles and 0.2% in those with correct lifestyles. Especially, heavy smokers with negative diagnostic tests have a high incidence of events, many of which are fatal.

### E-cigarette, or vaping, product use-associated lung injury in adolescents: A review of imaging features [^113thCYu]. Pediatric Radiology (2020). Low credibility.

There has been a recent increase in recognition of lung disease related to the use of electronic cigarettes (called "vaping"). These patients present with acute respiratory illness following exposure to vaporized cannabis or nicotine products and sometimes require hospitalization and intensive care. We describe the imaging findings of this disease entity in the pediatric population.

- **Objective**: To describe the radiologic findings of lung injury associated with electronic cigarette use (vaping) in the adolescent pediatric population.

- **Materials and methods**: We identified all adolescents with acute respiratory illness and a history of electronic cigarette use who presented at our institution within a 3-month period (June 2019 through August 2019). We excluded adolescents with potential interPulmonary disease. We reviewed the charts for symptomatology and laboratory and pathology data. In addition, we reviewed the chest radiographs and chest CTs of these adolescents.

- **Results**: The review group consisted of 12 teenage pediatric patients (10 boys and 2 girls; mean age 16.9 years, range 16.0–17.7 years) with acute respiratory illness found to have a temporal association with electronic cigarette use for cannabis products, nicotine, or both. Other etiologies for illness in these adolescents had been excluded by clinical and laboratory evaluation. All of the adolescents were admitted to the hospital for treatment. The clinical presentations included dyspnea, abdominal pain, and constitutional symptoms. Pulmonary function testing was performed in all patients.

### High-risk chief complaints I: Chest pain-the big three (an update) [^112PoAtR]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2020). Low credibility.

Nontraumatic chest pain is a frequent concern of emergency department patients, with causes that range from benign to immediately life threatening. Identifying those patients who require immediate or urgent intervention remains challenging and is a high-risk area for emergency medicine physicians, where incorrect or delayed diagnosis may lead to significant morbidity and mortality. This article focuses on the three most prevalent diagnoses associated with adverse outcomes in patients presenting with nontraumatic chest pain: acute coronary syndrome, thoracic aortic dissection, and pulmonary embolism. Important aspects of clinical evaluation, diagnostic testing, treatment, and disposition, as well as other less common causes of lethal chest pain, are also discussed.

### Update: Interim guidance for health care providers evaluating and caring for patients with suspected e-cigarette, or vaping, product use-associated lung injury - United States, October 2019 [^111TurUP]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2019). Low credibility.

Medical treatment: Corticosteroids might be helpful in treating this injury. Several case reports describe improvement with corticosteroids, likely because of a blunting of the inflammatory response. In a series of patients in Illinois and Wisconsin, 92% of 50 patients received corticosteroids; the medical team documented in 65% of 46 patient notes that "respiratory improvement was due to the use of glucocorticoids". Among 140 cases reported nationally to CDC that received corticosteroids, 82% of patients improved. However, the natural progression of this injury is not known, and it is possible that patients might recover without corticosteroids or by avoiding use of e-cigarette, or vaping, products.

In some circumstances, it would be advisable to withhold corticosteroids while evaluating patients for infectious etiologies, such as fungal pneumonia, that might worsen with corticosteroid treatment. Nevertheless, because the diagnosis remains one of exclusion, aggressive empiric therapy with corticosteroids, antimicrobial, and antiviral therapy might be warranted for patients with severe illness. A range of corticosteroid doses, durations, and taper plans might be considered on a case-by-case basis. Whenever possible, decisions on the use of corticosteroids and dosing regimen should be made in consultation with a pulmonologist.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for chest pain, particularly concerning history and physical examination, the ACC/ACCP/AHA/ASE/SAEM/SCCT/SCMR 2021 guidelines recommend avoiding the description of chest pain as "atypical", as it is not helpful in determining the cause and can be misinterpreted as benign in nature. Instead, describe chest pain as cardiac, possibly cardiac, or noncardiac, as these terms are more specific to the potential underlying diagnosis.

### Questions and answers on workup diagnosis and risk stratification: A companion document of the 2020 ESC guidelines for the management of acute coronary syndromes in patients presenting without persistent ST-segment elevation [^113SsAv4]. European Heart Journal (2021). Low credibility.

Q14. A 60-year-old patient with a history of CAD presents to the emergency department with chest pain and cough lasting for 2 days. The right-sided thoracic chest pain is persistent, moderate in intensity, non-radiating, and increases in intensity during inspiration. The last episode of chest pain started 8 hours prior to admission, and the patient is still mildly symptomatic in the emergency department. He is hemodynamically stable, and the physical examination is unremarkable. The 12-lead ECG shows T-wave inversion in lead I and aVL, which were already noted in the ECG performed last year. The initial hs-cTn I Architect concentration is very low/undetectable at 2 ng/L (ULN < 26 ng/L). The emergency department intern, a bright young physician who wants to become a cardiologist, challenges you by saying that "it is obvious that the chest pain does not represent acute MI and no additional investigations or blood tests in this respect are needed". Is she right?

Yes. NSTEMI, based on the delay between symptom onset and blood test, can be reliably ruled out with a single very low level of hs-cTn T/I. In addition, unstable angina is extremely unlikely since prolonged ischemia is expected to lead to some degree of cTn elevation. An alternative diagnosis, such as pneumonia/bronchitis, should be considered.

Q15. You are supervising the emergency department/chest pain unit (CPU) and see an 80-year-old patient with a history of CAD, prior MI, and hypertensive heart disease presenting with persistent moderate right-sided thoracic chest pain ongoing for 7 hours that increases in intensity during…

### Case series: Adolescent victims of the vaping public health crisis with pulmonary complications [^111WsxQ3]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2020). Low credibility.

Alongside the epidemic use of electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) across the country, evidence of multiple pulmonary complications has emerged, with the most immediately life-threatening being the new clinical condition of e-cigarette/vaping-associated lung injury (EVALI). Investigation is actively underway to further define this entity and determine the cause or causes. We present a series of cases of respiratory illnesses associated with e-cigarette use, many of which meet criteria for suspected or confirmed EVALI, managed at a pediatric tertiary care center, demonstrating notable variation in presenting symptoms and severity.

Most cases improved with supportive respiratory care and the administration of corticosteroids and antibiotics, although generally no infection was found. The cases also tend to show improvement with discontinuation of the use of e-cigarettes. We discuss challenges in determining the contribution of e-cigarettes to the case pathology and review possible diagnostic and treatment options.

In patients suffering from e-cigarette-related respiratory illness, including EVALI, the primary treatment goal should be the cessation of e-cigarette use and avoidance of other possible pulmonary toxins, including conventional cigarettes. Prevention of e-cigarette use is critical in the youth population, as these patients are typically nicotine naïve and do not engage in smoking conventional cigarettes before initiation of vaping.

### E-cigarette, or vaping, product use associated lung injury (EVALI): Case series and diagnostic approach [^113gE2P2]. The Lancet Respiratory Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Since June 2019, more than 1,000 new cases of e-cigarette, or vaping, product use associated lung injury (EVALI) have been reported in the United States. Patients presented with dyspnoea, cough, and were found to be hypoxaemic with bilateral airspace opacities on chest imaging. Most patients required management in the intensive care unit and steroid therapy. All patients recovered with cessation of vaping, supportive care, and steroid therapy, and remained symptom-free at follow-up. E-cigarette use continues to rapidly escalate in the United States, particularly among youth.

- **Methods**: Cases were defined as patients admitted to the University of Rochester Medical Center (Rochester, NY, USA) who had used e-cigarettes or another vaping device in the 30 days before presentation, and who had bilateral airspace opacification on chest imaging (CT or x-ray). Case details were obtained via medical record review and patient interviews over the past 3 months, including symptomatology, physical exam data, imaging studies, laboratory data, vaping history, and subsequent outpatient follow-up data. In collaboration with the New York State Department of Health, our hospital developed a novel clinical practice algorithm based on statewide physician feedback along with input from experts in environmental health, medical toxicology, infectious disease, epidemiology, and chronic disease prevention.

- **Findings**: We report 12 cases treated for suspected EVALI at our medical centre between June 6, 2019, and Sept 15, 2019. Ten (83%) patients had dyspnoea, fever, and emesis, and nine (75%) had cough. Eleven (92%) patients also exhibited hypoxaemia. All cases highlight the critical need for awareness and diagnostic protocols in the setting of escalating e-cigarette usage.

### Update: Interim guidance for health care providers for managing patients with suspected e-cigarette, or vaping, product use-associated lung injury - United States, November 2019 [^112fxVnj]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2019). Low credibility.

The CDC, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), state and local health departments, and public health and clinical stakeholders are investigating a nationwide outbreak of e-cigarette, or vaping, product use–associated lung injury (EVALI). The CDC has published recommendations for health care providers regarding EVALI. Recently, researchers from Utah and New York published proposed diagnosis and treatment algorithms for EVALI. EVALI remains a diagnosis of exclusion because, at present, no specific test or marker exists for its diagnosis, and evaluation should be guided by clinical judgment.

Because patients with EVALI can experience symptoms similar to those associated with influenza or other respiratory infections (e.g. fever, cough, headache, myalgias, or fatigue), it might be difficult to differentiate EVALI from influenza or community-acquired pneumonia on initial assessment. EVALI might also co-occur with respiratory infections. This report summarizes recommendations for health care providers managing patients with suspected or known EVALI when respiratory infections such as influenza are more prevalent in the community than they have been in recent months.

- **Recommendations include**: 1) asking patients with respiratory, gastrointestinal, or constitutional symptoms about the use of e-cigarette or vaping products; 2) evaluating those suspected to have EVALI with pulse oximetry and obtaining chest imaging, as clinically indicated; 3) considering outpatient management for clinically stable EVALI patients who meet certain criteria; 4) testing patients for influenza, particularly.

### Executive summary: Diagnosis and management of lung cancer, 3rd ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^114c44ZB]. Chest (2013). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for non-small cell lung cancer, particularly concerning initial evaluation, the ACCP 2013 guidelines recommend obtaining additional imaging for metastases in patients with known or suspected lung cancer who present with abnormal clinical evaluations but have no suspicious extrathoracic abnormalities on chest CT. A PET scan (where available) should be obtained to evaluate for metastases (excluding the brain) in patients with normal clinical evaluations and no suspicious extrathoracic abnormalities on chest CT, especially those eligible for curative-intent treatment.

### A case of vaping-associated pulmonary illness in South America: Highlighting the need for awareness and surveillance programs in the region [^115z3sXz]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

A 20-year-old male patient presented to the emergency department after one week of worsening symptoms consisting of nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, subjective fever, chest tightness, shortness of breath, wheezing, and a persistent tension-like headache in the fronto-orbital region. On admission, his vital signs included blood pressure of 130/85 mm Hg, heart rate of 95/min, respiratory rate of 18/min, temperature of 38.3°C, and 94% saturation at room air. On physical examination, the patient was diaphoretic and in visible distress, with scattered wheezes in both pulmonary fields. The rest of the examination was within normal limits. The patient's past medical history included seasonal allergic rhinitis and a four-year use of e-cigarettes, including various products containing tetrahydrocannabinol compounds. The patient was hospitalized with a presumptive diagnosis of acute rhinosinusitis and possible asthma exacerbation.

Laboratory results were unremarkable, including the levels of C-reactive protein. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the paranasal sinuses showed changes consistent with a chronic allergic or inflammatory process. An empiric course of antibiotics, intravenous hydration, and analgesia were initiated, as well as respiratory therapy with bronchodilators. Reevaluation at 48 hours after initial hospitalization revealed partial improvement. However, the patient still complained, albeit to a lesser extent, of chest tightness and shortness of breath, prompting further imaging. A CT scan of the chest revealed bilateral ground-glass opacities, raising suspicion of a more serious underlying condition.

### Diagnosis and management of inhalation injury: An updated review [^112vqu6i]. Critical Care (2015). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on inhalation injury:

- **Definition**: Inhalation injury refers to damage to the respiratory tract and lungs caused by the inhalation of harmful substances such as smoke, gases, vapors, fumes, chemicals, dusts, mists, aerosols, or airborne particles.

- **Pathophysiology**: Thermal injuries typically affect the upper airway due to heat dissipation and protective reflexes, while chemical irritants in smoke damage both the upper and lower airways. This damage leads to mucosal sloughing, inflammatory mediator release, impaired mucociliary clearance, airway obstruction, and pulmonary edema. Systemic toxicity from inhaled carbon monoxide (CO) and cyanide exacerbates hypoxia by impairing oxygen transport and metabolism, potentially resulting in early mortality. Within 12–48 hours, necrotizing bronchitis, airway swelling, and pulmonary edema may cause respiratory failure, with increased susceptibility to infections due to epithelial necrosis. Chemical inhalation injury involves damage to the respiratory system through direct cellular interactions or alterations in the cellular microenvironment. Respiratory irritants, depending on their water solubility, liberate acids, alkali, and oxidants, triggering inflammatory cascades and damaging mucous membranes. Exposure to specific agents like metal fumes, hard metal dusts, and fluorocarbon breakdown products induces immunological and inflammatory responses through antigen-antibody complex formation, cytokine release, and neutrophil activation. Asphyxiant agents exacerbate hypoxia, with systemic asphyxiants intensifying the condition by interfering with cellular respiration or oxygen delivery.

### Characteristics and outcomes of young adults who present to the emergency department with chest pain [^115J1nfg]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Most studies of emergency department (ED) chest pain patients exclude those younger than 30–40 years old. As a result, the clinical course of these patients is poorly described. The objective was to study the clinical characteristics, hospital course, and 30-day outcomes of ED chest pain patients younger than 40 years old. The hypothesis was that patients under 40 years without a cardiac history and with normal electrocardiograms (ECGs) or no cardiac risk factors would have less than a 1% risk for acute coronary syndromes (ACSs) and 30-day adverse cardiovascular (CV) events.

This was a prospective cohort study of non-cocaine-using ED patients aged 24–39 who received an ECG for chest pain between July 9, 1999, and October 23, 2000. Structured data collection at presentation included demographics, chest pain description, history, laboratory, and ECG data. Hospital course was followed daily. Thirty-day follow-up was performed by telephone. The main outcomes were discharge diagnosis and 30-day adverse CV events, which included acute myocardial infarction (AMI), death, percutaneous intervention (PCI), or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).

A total of 487 patients presented 527 times and comprised the study group. Patients were most often 30–39 years old (71%), female (60%), and African-American (73%). Thirty-two percent were admitted. Five hundred seven of 527 patient visits (96%) had 30-day follow-up. Patients had the following cardiac risk factors: tobacco use, 37%; hypertension, 22%; family history, 19%; diabetes mellitus, 6%; cholesterol, 6%; prior angina, 3%; known coronary artery disease.

### Update: Interim guidance for health care providers evaluating and caring for patients with suspected e-cigarette, or vaping, product use associated lung injury - United States, October 2019 [^112evvxW]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2019). Low credibility.

It is unknown if patients with a history of EVALI are at higher risk for severe complications of influenza or other respiratory viral infections if they are infected simultaneously or after recovering from lung injury. Health care providers should emphasize the importance of annual vaccination against influenza for all persons older than 6 months of age, including patients with a history of EVALI. In addition, administration of pneumococcal vaccine should be considered according to guidelines.

- **Addressing exposures**: Advising patients to discontinue use of e-cigarette or vaping products should be an integral part of the care approach during an inpatient admission and should be re-emphasized during outpatient follow-up. Cessation of e-cigarette or vaping products might speed recovery from this injury; resuming use has the potential to cause recurrence of symptoms or lung injury. Evidence-based tobacco product cessation strategies include behavioral counseling and FDA-approved cessation medications. For patients who have an addiction to THC-containing or nicotine-containing products, cognitive-behavioral therapy, contingency management, motivational enhancement therapy, and multidimensional family therapy have been shown to help. Consultation with addiction medicine services should be considered.

- **Special considerations for groups at high risk**: Patients with certain characteristics or comorbidities, including older age, history of cardiac or lung disease, or pregnancy, might be at higher risk for more severe outcomes.
