## Question

According to AAFP and AAP guidelines, what checklist items should be completed at a 2-year-old well-child visit?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which checklist items should be completed at a 2-year-old well-child visit per AAFP and AAP guidelines. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about which guidelines anchor a 24-month visit. Then, I should verify required screenings and immunizations at this age. Next, I will examine growth, nutrition, and obesity-related elements. After that, I need to check developmental and autism-specific screening. Finally, I will integrate anticipatory guidance, oral health, and risk-based labs such as lead, and ensure documentation and follow-up plans align with evidence-based models.

> Let me first confirm the primary sources I should rely on, because I need to ensure the checklist aligns with authoritative recommendations. The AAP Bright Futures/AAP Periodicity Schedule provides the backbone for visit content and timing, while the ACIP 2025 immunization schedule dictates vaccines and catch-up, and the 2023 AAP obesity guideline informs growth measurement, BMI classification, and any comorbidity screening triggers beginning at 2 years old, so I will ground the flow in these documents and use additional literature to support implementation nuances.

> Now, history and physical examination: I need to ensure I capture interval history, medications, allergies, prior screening results, diet, sleep, elimination and toilet readiness, injury risk, behavior and tantrums, social determinants, and family concerns, then perform a head-to-toe exam with vital signs and growth review; wait, I should verify that Bright Futures emphasizes comprehensive history and anticipatory guidance at each visit, which it does, and AAFP summaries reinforce these core elements including reviewing growth and updating immunizations, so I will anchor the H&P to those standards while explicitly soliciting parent priorities to guide counseling [^117HJwcY] [^117SQv5C].

> For growth and nutrition, let me think about precise steps: measure length/height, weight, and head circumference as indicated, then calculate BMI and plot age- and sex-specific percentiles; I should confirm classification thresholds at age 2, and yes, the AAP 2023 guideline diagnoses overweight as BMI ≥ 85th to < 95th percentile, obesity as ≥ 95th percentile, and severe obesity as ≥ 120% of the 95th percentile for age and sex, which applies starting at 2 years; counseling on nutrition, sweetened beverages, and physical activity follows, and if obesity is present at 2 years, I need to consider early evaluation for lipid abnormalities though most comorbidity labs are strongly recommended from age ≥ 10, with selective evaluation in younger children with obesity, so I will document shared decision-making if ordering a fasting lipid panel in a 2-year-old with obesity [^11291DfP] [^115HdYH2] [^114nnd2Q].

> Blood pressure is tricky at this age, so hold on, I should verify whether routine BP is recommended at 24 months; guidelines generally initiate routine BP measurement at age 3, while risk-based measurements can be considered earlier for specific comorbidities, which means at a standard 2-year visit I will not universally measure BP unless the child is at risk; I should also make sure risk-based cardiovascular screening logic aligns with JAHA analyses of at-risk cohorts, and note that in children with overweight/obesity, the AAP obesity guideline emphasizes measuring BP at every visit starting at age 3, reinforcing my plan to defer universal BP at 2 years unless there are clear risk factors [^1115qdXr] [^114qyq3A] [^115HdYH2].

> Developmental surveillance and screening require careful attention right now; wait, I almost said "formal developmental screening at 24 months", but let me correct that, because AAP calls for general developmental screening at 9, 18, and 30 months, not 24; however, autism-specific screening is recommended at 18 and 24 months, so at this 2-year visit I should perform M-CHAT-R with follow-up as needed and continue developmental surveillance; moreover, I need to consider the pandemic's potential impact on milestone attainment and parental concern trends when interpreting results, and I can use contemporary norms to refine interpretation and a standardized tool to increase screening reliability and uptake in practice [^117HJwcY] [^113XxmjJ] [^113kWhwi] [^114gMjKM] [^117HJwcY].

> Next, I should review autism risk and symptoms explicitly, because the AACAP practice parameter emphasizes incorporating ASD symptom questions into young children's developmental assessments; if concerns or positive screens arise, I will initiate timely referral for diagnostic evaluation and early intervention, documenting red flags in social communication and restrictive behaviors and ensuring family support is offered during the referral process [^116A9k9p].

> Immunizations must be verified against the current ACIP schedule; let me double-check that at 24 months we are typically addressing catch-up doses and annual influenza vaccination, so I will reconcile the record using the 2025 child and adolescent immunization schedule and apply the notes and addendum for any updates since last visit, documenting contraindications and deferrals when applicable and scheduling follow-up for pending doses or influenza season [^112WgDW4].

> Lead exposure screening deserves attention at this age, but I should verify the approach is risk- and locale-dependent; at 24 months, jurisdictions with higher prevalence or risk profiles often recommend blood lead testing, and point-of-care testing can substantially improve screening rates at 12- and 24-month well visits, so I will use a validated risk assessment and order testing per local public health guidance, leveraging POC when feasible to close care gaps [^1143uCHZ].

> Oral health should not be overlooked; I need to ensure an oral health risk assessment is done, confirm or establish a dental home, and discuss fluoride toothpaste use and dietary practices like limiting juice and sugary snacks, and if the child still lacks a dental home, I will prioritize referral since the AAP recommends risk assessment and early referral by age 1, with AAFP summaries reinforcing fluoride use and cup transition to support dental health [^115J4ekh] [^117HJwcY].

> Anticipatory guidance at 2 years should be targeted yet comprehensive; let me review high-yield topics: behavior and discipline strategies, language stimulation and reading, toilet readiness cues, sleep routines, injury prevention including drowning prevention, firearm safety, and car seat use; wait, I should confirm car seat guidance, and yes, keep rear-facing until at least age 2 or until the seat's height or weight limit is reached, transitioning only when criteria are met; I should also confirm media guidance, and AAP expert opinion supports avoiding screen time under 18 months except video chat and limiting to about one hour daily for older toddlers, so I will tailor counseling to parent priorities while ensuring essential topics are addressed [^117HJwcY].

> Given variable adherence to comprehensive anticipatory guidance in routine practice, I should consider workflow supports; team-based care models that integrate a community health worker or health educator improve the delivery of preventive services and anticipatory guidance, and explicit attention to parent-prioritized topics can increase relevance, so I will document parent concerns up front and consider pre-visit screening and education to optimize in-visit time and content [^112Z1ZRh] [^1154Cvic].

> For cardiovascular risk beyond BMI at this age, hold on, I should verify lipid and glucose testing indications; universal lipid or glucose screening is not recommended at 2 years, but in children 2–9 years with obesity, evaluation for lipid abnormalities may be considered, whereas routine diabetes or MASLD labs are generally reserved for age ≥ 10 unless specific risk factors are present, so I will individualize based on the child's BMI category, family history, and comorbid risk [^115HdYH2] [^114nnd2Q] [^114qyq3A].

> I need to ensure developmental implementation is feasible in busy practice; standardized tools use has improved over time but barriers persist, so incorporating validated screeners like M-CHAT-R and using EHR prompts or web-based workflows can sustain uptake without lengthening visits, and documentation quality may even improve through thoughtful EHR integration during transitions, which I will leverage for consistent delivery and tracking of preventive elements [^117HJwcY] [^111KCQUh] [^115o1VkD].

> Finally, I should confirm the value and follow-up plan: high-quality well-child care in the first two years is associated with reduced avoidable hospitalizations, which supports rigorous adherence to the visit elements above; I will close the visit with shared decision-making summaries, a written care plan including referrals, lab orders, anticipatory guidance handouts, and a clear return timeline for the next preventive visit and any interim concerns, making sure my approach aligns with Bright Futures and current ACIP and AAP guidance before the family leaves [^1163PY61] [^117SQv5C] [^112WgDW4].

---

## Oral health

Ensure a **dental home** is established if not already [^115J4ekh], and apply **fluoride varnish** if indicated [^117HJwcY].

---

## Laboratory screening

Perform **lead screening** [^1143uCHZ] universally or based on risk, as recommended, and conduct **anemia screening** if risk factors are present [^117SQv5C].

---

## Behavioral and social assessment

Perform a **behavioral assessment** covering sleep patterns, nutrition, screen time, and family stressors [^114nnd2Q], and assess **social determinants of health** such as housing stability, food security, and caregiver mental health [^115fZmn2].

### Clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and treatment of children and adolescents with obesity [^112PrSUq]. Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for childhood obesity, more specifically with respect to indications for screening, AAP 2023 guidelines recommend measuring height and weight, calculating BMI, and assessing BMI percentile using age- and sex-specific growth charts. Growth charts for children with severe obesity should be used at least annually to screen for overweight, obesity, and severe obesity in all children aged 2–18 years.

### Point-of-care testing improves lead screening rates at 1- and 2-year well visits [^1143uCHZ]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2021). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to increase blood lead level screening rates in children at 12- and 24-month well visits through provider education and the implementation of a point-of-care (POC) lead screening program. This program was implemented in four primary care practice offices located in counties with a prevalence of blood lead levels ≥ 5 μg/dL.

- **Study design**: Baseline data were collected from July 2017 to June 2018. Providers received education on screening recommendations and the local prevalence of elevated blood lead levels in July 2018. POC testing began in June 2019 at one of the four practice sites. Screening rates were measured by electronic medical record abstraction and were plotted monthly on statistical process control charts during implementation. Data were analyzed using logistic regression under an interrupted time series approach for program evaluation.

- **Results**: There was a small but significant increase in screening following provider education (OR 1.04 per month, 95% CI 1.02–1.07). POC testing was associated with a substantial immediate increase (OR 4.17, 95% CI 2.45–7.09) and a continued increase (OR 1.34 per month, 95% CI 1.17–1.54) in screening rates at the site that implemented POC testing.

- **Conclusions**: POC testing substantially increases blood lead level screening rates at 12- and 24-month well visits and may be beneficial in other primary care settings.

### Adherence to pediatric screening [^114qyq3A]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). High credibility.

Risk-based screenings focus on lipids and blood glucose. For each child aged 2 years who attended a well-child visit and had a history of a relevant risk factor for which screening of blood pressure (BP) is recommended, receipt of both systolic and diastolic BP measurements was assessed. Similarly, for each child between 2 and 8 years who attended a well-child visit with a history of a relevant risk factor for which screening of lipids is recommended, receipt of a total cholesterol and HDL measurement was assessed. For children aged 10 to 12 years who attended a well-child visit with a history of a relevant blood glucose risk factor, receipt of a fasting blood glucose or HbA1c measurement was assessed.

Comorbidities used to identify "at-risk" children eligible for screening were identified via ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes and carried forward if detected.

- **Blood pressure (BP)**: These included premature birth, congenital heart disease, urinary tract infections, hematuria, proteinuria, renal disease or urologic malformations, solid-organ transplant, malignancy or bone marrow transplant, or other systemic illnesses associated with hypertension such as neurofibromatosis, tuberous sclerosis, or sickle cell disease.

- **Lipids**: These included diabetes, hypertension, obesity (defined as ≥ 95th percentile in BMI using height and weight measured at most recent visit), chronic kidney disease, cardiac transplant, Kawasaki disease with or regressed coronary aneurysms, or chronic inflammatory disease.

- **Blood glucose**: This included BMI ≥ 85th percentile (measured at the most recent visit).

### Trends in the use of standardized tools for developmental screening in early childhood: 2002–2009 [^113XxmjJ]. Pediatrics (2011). High credibility.

Early identification of developmental delays is essential for optimal early intervention. An American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) 2002 Periodic Survey of Fellows found that less than 25% of respondents consistently used appropriate screening tools. Over the past five years, new research and education programs have promoted the implementation of screening. In 2006, the AAP issued a revised policy statement with a detailed algorithm. Since the 2002 Periodic Survey, no national surveys have examined the effectiveness of policy, programmatic, and educational enhancements.

- **Objective**: The goal of this study was to compare pediatricians' use of standardized screening tools from 2002 to 2009.

- **Methods**: A national, random sample of non-retired US AAP members were mailed Periodic Surveys (2002: N = 1617, response rate: 55%; 2009: N = 1620, response rate: 57%). χ(2) analyses were used to examine responses across survey years; a multivariate logistic regression model was developed to compare differences in using ≥ 1 formal screening tool across survey years while controlling for various individual and practice characteristics.

- **Results**: Pediatricians' use of standardized screening tools increased significantly between 2002 and 2009. The percentage of those who self-reported always/almost always using ≥ 1 screening tools increased over time (23.0%-47.7%), as did the use of specific instruments (e.g. Ages & Stages Questionnaire, Parents' Evaluation of Developmental Status). No differences were noted on the basis of physician or practice characteristics.

### Advisory committee on immunization practices recommended immunization schedule for children and adolescents aged 18 years or younger - United States, 2025 [^112WgDW4]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2025). High credibility.

At its October 2024 meeting, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) approved the Recommended Immunization Schedule for Children and Adolescents Aged 18 Years or Younger, United States, 2025. The schedule supports health care providers, as well as public health and other professionals, by providing a consolidated summary of ACIP recommendations for vaccinating children and adolescents.

The 2025 schedule includes several updates to the cover page, tables, notes, and appendix. The addendum remains part of the schedule and will be used to summarize new or updated ACIP recommendations that occur before the next annual schedule update. Health care providers are strongly encouraged to use all parts of the schedule (the cover page, tables, notes, appendix, and addendum) together when making recommendations for individual patients. The 2025 child and adolescent immunization schedule can be found on the CDC website (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/imz-schedules/index.html).

### A longitudinal study of developmental and behavioral screening and referral in North Carolina's assuring better child health and development participating practices [^114WaKev]. Clinical Pediatrics (2009). Low credibility.

Screening children for developmental and behavioral delays is an important part of primary care practice. Well-child visits provide an ideal opportunity to engage parents and conduct periodic screenings. Screening identifies children who may be at risk and need further evaluation. In North Carolina's Assuring Better Child Health and Development project, a best-practices process, screening was incorporated as a routine part of well-child visits regardless of payor. The schedule of screenings, using the Ages and Stages Questionnaire, was set for 6, 12, 18 or 24, 36, 48, and 60 months. From the practices' population, a cohort of 526 children, screened from the age of 6 months during August 2001 through November 2003, was retrospectively reviewed.

The main objectives of this descriptive study were to determine the number of children who were screened and whether this rate improved over time, observe patterns and trajectories for children identified at risk in one or more of the five developmental domains, and examine referral rates and physician referral patterns.

### Does trainee involvement affect anticipatory guidance in well-child care [^113md65u]. Clinical Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Studies demonstrate gaps in anticipatory guidance during well-child visits, but none consider academic teaching hospitals where physician trainees also provide counseling. We prospectively assessed parental perception of anticipatory guidance at the outpatient clinic of an academic teaching hospital.

- **Methods**: Parents of patients, newborn to under 60 months old, completed questionnaires regarding providers seen and anticipatory guidance preferences.

- **Results**: Of 204 parents, 40% saw the child's primary attending alone. There was no association between providers seen and the number of topics covered. Seeing the child's primary attending alone increased the odds that parents' priority topics were covered compared with another attending (odds ratio [OR] = 0.31; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.11–0.90) or the addition of a resident (OR = 0.35; 95% CI = 0.16–0.77) or medical student (OR = 0.33; 95% CI = 0.12–0.90).

- **Conclusions**: Priority anticipatory guidance is covered only one third as often when the well-child visit is not conducted by the primary attending. When involving trainees, continuity of care and parental concerns must be emphasized.

### Community health workers in early childhood well-child care for Medicaid-insured children: A randomized clinical trial [^112Z1ZRh]. JAMA (2023). High credibility.

An intervention model, the Parent-focused Redesign for Encounters, Newborns to Toddlers (the PARENT intervention), for well-child care that integrates a community health worker into preventive care services may enhance early childhood well-child care.

- **Objective**: To examine the effectiveness of the PARENT intervention vs. usual care for parents with children younger than 2 years of age.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: A cluster randomized clinical trial was conducted between March 2019 and July 2022. Of the 1,283 parents with a child younger than 2 years of age presenting for a well-child visit at one of the 10 clinic sites (two federally qualified health centers in California and Washington) approached for trial participation, 937 were enrolled.

- **Intervention**: Five clinics implemented the PARENT intervention, which is a team-based approach to care that uses a community health worker in the role of a coach (i.e. health educator) as part of the well-child care team to provide comprehensive preventive services, and five clinics provided usual care.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: There were two primary outcomes: the score for parent-reported receipt of recommended anticipatory guidance during well-child visits (score range, 0–100) and emergency department (ED) use (proportion with ≥ 2 ED visits). The secondary outcomes included psychosocial screening, developmental screening, health care use, and parent-reported experiences of care.

- **Results**: Of the 937 parents who were enrolled, 914 remained eligible to participate (n = 438 in the intervention group and n = 476 in the usual care group).

### Developmental milestone attainment in US children before and during the COVID-19 pandemic [^113kWhwi]. JAMA Pediatrics (2024). High credibility.

The restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted the lives of young children, but the association between the pandemic and any changes in early childhood developmental milestone achievement in the US remains unclear. The objective of this study was to determine the association between the COVID-19 pandemic and changes in developmental screening scores among US children aged 0 to 5 years. It also aimed to investigate whether caregivers self-reported more worries about their children or concerns about children's behavior during the pandemic, regardless of milestone achievement.

This was a cohort study using an interrupted time series analysis. It compared prepandemic (March 1, 2018, to February 29, 2020), interruption (March 1 to May 31, 2020), and intrapandemic (June 1, 2020, to May 30, 2022) periods among 50,205 children. These children were randomly sampled from a population of 502,052 children aged 0 to 5 years. Their parents or caregivers completed developmental screenings at pediatric visits at US pediatric primary care practices participating in a web-based clinical process support system.

- **Exposure**: COVID-19 pandemic period.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Age-standardized Ages and Stages Questionnaire, Third Edition (ASQ) domain scores (communication, personal-social, problem-solving, gross motor, fine motor), and the rate of caregivers' concerns about the child's behavior or worries about the child as measured on the ASQ.

A total of 50,205 children (51.5% male; mean age, 18.6 months) and 134,342 ASQ observations were included.

### Universal lipid screening among 9- to 11-year-old children: Screening results and physician management [^114L7JEn]. Clinical Pediatrics (2022). Low credibility.

The NHLBI/AAP guidelines recommend lipid screening at 2 to 8 years old for children with a family history of CVD or dyslipidemia, or for children with diabetes, hypertension, and/or elevated BMI. However, these guidelines had rarely been followed in our clinic population prior to the study period, and almost no children had lipid screening done before age 9 to 11 years. Thus, all children 9 to 11 years old were eligible for inclusion, regardless of whether they were screened at a younger age due to family history or medical conditions. Children aged 9 to 11 years who completed lipid screening during the study period were excluded if they presented for another well-child visit during the study period.

Point-of-care testing and in-clinic phlebotomy were not available; all children were required to go to an off-site laboratory for lipid screening. Abnormal non-fasting lipid screens and FLP results were determined based on the NHLBI/AAP guidelines. In our screening protocol, pediatricians could choose to order an initial lipid screen as either a non-fasting lipid screen (non-fasting total cholesterol [TC] and high-density lipoprotein [HDL]-cholesterol) or a FLP. If the initial non-fasting lipid screen was abnormal, the pediatrician was expected to order a FLP for confirmatory testing. A child was considered to have an abnormal lipid screen if either the initial non-fasting lipid screen or the initial FLP was abnormal. A child was considered to have dyslipidemia if either the confirmatory FLP result or the initial FLP was abnormal.

### Quality of evidence and strength of recommendations in American Academy of Pediatrics' guidelines [^112FqLUX]. Pediatrics (2025). High credibility.

The objective of this research was to summarize the quality of the evidence and the strength of recommendations in the American Academy of Pediatrics' (AAP) clinical practice guidelines.

- **Methods**: We identified the AAP's clinical practice guidelines from its website. Three independent reviewers abstracted each recommendation, the quality of evidence supporting it, and its strength from every guideline. Discrepancies were resolved by consensus, and results were analyzed using descriptive statistics.

- **Results**: We identified 14 clinical practice guidelines. Individual guidelines make between 1 and 39 recommendations (mean 16.9, median 15), and the guidelines make a total of 236 recommendations. Twenty-five (10.6%) recommendations are based on Level A evidence (well-designed and conducted trials, meta-analyses), 112 (47.5%) on Level B (trials with minor limitations; consistent findings from multiple observational studies), 64 (27.1%) on Level C (single or few observational studies or multiple studies with inconsistent findings or major limitations), 15 (6.4%) on Level D (expert opinion, case reports, reasoning from first principles), and 20 (8.5%) on Level X (exceptional situations in which validating studies cannot be performed and there is a clear preponderance of benefit or harm). Eighty-two (34.7%) recommendations are strong, 117 (49.6%) moderate, and 37 (15.7%) weak. Fifty of the 117 (42.7%) moderate recommendations are based on Level C evidence, and 10 of the 82 (13%) strong recommendations are based on Level X evidence.

The conclusion section is incomplete, thus omitted from this summary.

### Five-year trends in US children's health and well-being, 2016–2020 [^115av263]. JAMA Pediatrics (2022). Low credibility.

More work remains to achieve the nation's goals to improve children's health and well-being. The findings of this study can be used to inform programmatic investments and priorities, and support stakeholders in making data-informed decisions. For instance, the Maternal and Child Health Bureau of the Health Resources and Services Administration, the federal agency that sponsors the NSCH, also administers several programs that address some of the significant health-related challenges highlighted here.

- **Pediatric Mental Health Care Access Program**: Expands access to pediatric mental health care by integrating telehealth services into pediatric practices in states, territories, and tribal regions to support primary care clinicians to diagnose, treat, and refer children and youth for mental health conditions.

- **Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting Program**: Addresses parental stress and promotes family well-being by supporting people during pregnancy and the early childhood years. Health, social service, and child development resources and skill development are offered through regular home visits to address families' wide-ranging needs.

- **Bright Futures Program**: Disseminates age-specific, evidence-based guidelines for comprehensive well-child visits, including guidelines on developmental screening and surveillance; behavioral, social, and emotional assessment; and screening for maternal postpartum depression.

In response to the decline in children's preventive care during the pandemic, the Maternal and Child Health Bureau launched the Promoting Pediatric Primary

### Adherence to pediatric screening [^1128Hw5q]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Low credibility.

Here, we describe adherence to universal age-based and risk-based cardiovascular disease (CVD) screening guidelines using electronic health records (EHRs) from 197,559 well-child visits in children aged 2 to 12 years, within a diverse urban population. Adherence to body mass index (BMI) screening guidelines — the only cardiovascular health (CVH) metric always recommended for universal age-based screening — was most prevalent, with roughly 8 out of 10 well-child visits including a complete screening. However, we found that only approximately 1 in 3 eligible visits included blood pressure (BP) screening, and 1 in 10 included screening for lipids and blood glucose according to recommended universal or risk-based guidelines.

To our knowledge, no descriptive studies of adherence to BMI screening in pediatric EHRs have been conducted. Similar ambulatory visit BP screening adherence rates (35 per 100) were found in comparable studies. Universal lipid screening rates in similar studies ranged from 4 per 100 eligible children to 20 per 100 standard-risk children and 47 per 100 high-risk children. Risk-based blood glucose screening adherence was higher in a similar study, with 34 in 100 eligible children aged 10 to 18 years receiving screening.

Universal age-based pediatric screening for CVD risk factors is recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics, American Heart Association (AHA)/American College of Cardiology, American Diabetes Association, and National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute to identify and address risk factors, increase health equity, and improve health outcomes. Early identification of the loss of ideal CVD risk factors could lead to earlier interventions, potentially preventing worsening outcomes.

### Clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and treatment of children and adolescents with obesity [^115HdYH2]. Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

The AAP 2023 guidelines provide specific recommendations for the evaluation of comorbidities in pediatric patients with obesity. These guidelines emphasize the importance of taking a comprehensive patient history, conducting mental and behavioral health screenings, evaluating social determinants of health, performing physical examinations, and utilizing diagnostic studies to evaluate for obesity-related comorbidities in patients aged 2–18 years. The following guidance is provided for specific situations:

- **Dyslipidemia**: Obtain a fasting lipid panel for pediatric and adolescent patients aged ≥ 10 years with obesity or overweight. It is also recommended to evaluate for lipid abnormalities in patients aged 2–9 years with obesity.

- **Diabetes**: Conduct testing for abnormal glucose metabolism by obtaining fasting plasma glucose, 2-hour plasma glucose following a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test, or HbA1c in patients aged ≥ 10 years with obesity. Patients with overweight who have risk factors for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) or metabolic associated steatohepatitis (MASLD) should also be evaluated.

- **MASLD**: Assess liver function by obtaining an alanine transaminase measurement in patients aged ≥ 10 years with obesity. Patients with overweight should be evaluated if they have risk factors for T2DM or MASLD.

- **Hypertension**: Measure blood pressure at every visit starting at 3 years of age to evaluate for hypertension in pediatric and adolescent patients with overweight and obesity.

Several studies have suggested that clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) developed in regions with varying economic development statuses might influence the quality of these guidelines. This study found that CPGs developed by developing countries or regions often exhibited poorer quality in the domains related to "scope and purpose", "stakeholder involvement", "applicability", and "editorial independence". It was also observed that most CPGs of poor quality from these regions did not adhere to a strict and comprehensive development procedure; some did not utilize evidence-based methods, potentially affecting their quality.

Meanwhile, most high-quality CPGs were developed by countries or organizations with significant funding and resources. A previous study suggested that the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) internal CPGs scored significantly higher than the endorsed ones. These high-quality guidelines were developed using a thoroughly completed, evidence-based procedure. Furthermore, the CPG committee comprised clinical experts, methodologists, and other stakeholders from various fields, enhancing both the rigor of development and practical applicability.

In resource-limited developing countries, forming a complete expert group to complete the CPG development procedure may present challenges. One potential solution for these regions could be adapting existing high-quality CPGs. International collaboration might also be a viable approach for developing CPGs. However, due to nuances in healthcare systems worldwide, agencies should consider these differences, as they may preclude the direct implementation of international CPGs.

### Effectiveness of compliance with pediatric preventive care guidelines among Medicaid beneficiaries [^1163PY61]. Pediatrics (2001). Low credibility.

The study aimed to examine the relationship between compliance with health supervision in infancy and improved health outcomes, focusing on the association between adherence to guidelines for periodic health supervision and the incidence of avoidable hospitalizations.

- **Methods**: This historic cohort study involved 308,131 children enrolled in Medicaid at birth in California, Georgia, and Michigan in 1990, using Medicaid records linked across 3 years. Avoidable hospitalizations were used as indicators of health in a survival analysis. Completeness and timeliness of well-child visits and immunizations were evaluated using AAP guidelines for health supervision as the gold standard.

- **Results**: Children up-to-date on well-child visits were less likely to have avoidable hospitalizations (adjusted hazard ratios: 0.52 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.50–0.55] in California, 0.54 [95% CI: 0.50–0.55] in Georgia, and 0.7 [95% CI: 0.69–0.79] in Michigan). Sporadic preventive care visits conferred a mild benefit for those not up-to-date. Immunizations and race/ethnicity showed no consistent relationship with avoidable hospitalizations.

- **Conclusions**: Well-child visits during the first 2 years of life positively affect health outcomes, as evidenced by reduced avoidable hospitalizations among poor and near-poor children.

### Agamree [^11283U1k]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Assessments prior to first dose of Agamree**: Administer all immunizations according to immunization guidelines prior to starting Agamree. Administer live-attenuated or live vaccines at least 4 to 6 weeks prior to starting Agamree [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)].

- **Dosing information**: The recommended dosage of Agamree is 6 mg/kg taken orally once daily, preferably with a meal, up to a maximum daily dosage of 300 mg for patients weighing more than 50 kg. Some patients may respond to a dose of 2 mg/kg daily. Doses may be titrated down to 2 mg/kg/day as needed based on individual tolerability.

- **Recommended dosage for hepatic impairment**: The recommended dosage of Agamree in patients with mild (Child-Pugh A) to moderate (Child-Pugh B) hepatic impairment is 2 mg/kg taken orally once daily, preferably with a meal, up to a maximum daily dosage of 100 mg for patients weighing more than 50 kg [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Doses may be titrated down based on individual tolerability.

- **Important preparation and administration instructions**: Shake Agamree oral suspension well for about 30 seconds before administration. Use only the oral syringe provided with the product. After withdrawing the appropriate dose into the oral syringe, dispense directly into the mouth. Discard any unused Agamree oral suspension remaining after 3 months of first opening the bottle.

- **Switching from corticosteroid treatment to Agamree**: Patients can be switched from oral corticosteroid treatment (such as prednisone or deflazacort) to Agamree.

### A clinical vignette-based study of physicians' adherence to guidelines for dental referrals of young children [^115J4ekh]. Academic Pediatrics (2019). Low credibility.

- **Objectives**: The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends an oral health risk assessment and referral to a dental home by a child's first birthday. We evaluated the adherence of primary care providers (PCPs) to AAP dental referral guidelines for children younger than 3 years of age.

- **Methods**: Our study used clinical vignettes and surveys of PCPs to assess knowledge and behaviors related to dental referrals for young children.

- **Results**: Adherence rates exceeded 90% for high-risk children. An inadequate workforce reduced adherence for most levels of risk. Generally, correct knowledge of risk status, barriers to risk assessment, and pediatric practice were associated with adherence, but not always in the hypothesized direction.

- **Conclusions**: PCPs' adherence to referral guidelines varied.

### Challenges to implementation of developmental screening in urban primary care: A mixed methods study [^1168o3ah]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

This study explores the various barriers and facilitators in the implementation of developmental screening in urban primary care settings. The research employs a mixed methods approach to gather comprehensive insights into the existing challenges.

- **Study findings**: The study identified several obstacles, such as limited time during consultations, inadequate training for healthcare providers, and a lack of integration with existing Electronic Health Records (EHR). Additionally, the complexity of the screening tools and limited staff resources further exacerbate these challenges.

- **Recommendations**: To improve developmental screening, the study suggests enhanced training through Continuing Medical Education (CME) programs and better integration of screening tools with EHR systems. The acceptance and utilization of tools like the Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (M-CHAT) and the Ages & Stages Questionnaires, Second Edition (ASQ-II), are also encouraged.

In light of these findings, addressing these barriers is crucial for the successful implementation of developmental screening in these healthcare settings.

### Quality of pediatric clinical practice guidelines [^115TEMfM]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). High credibility.

The "rigor of development" domain is vital for creating a qualified clinical practice guideline (CPG). This domain involves gathering and synthesizing evidence, promoting recommendations, and updating schedules of CPGs. The AGREE II manual and RIGHT checklist offer suggestions for CPG development and reporting, including systematic methods, evidence criteria, review procedures, and update schedules. These resources should be consulted and followed during the proposal, development, report, review, and update procedures of a CPG.

Recently, several studies have raised concerns that conflicts of interest could affect the quality of CPGs. However, only a limited number of CPGs have described the management of financial conflicts of interest. Komesaroff et al. defined "conflicts of interest" as "the condition that arises when two coexisting interests directly conflict with each other: that is when they are likely to compel contrary and incompatible outcomes"; Grundy et al. and Wiersma et al. emphasized the importance of recognizing "non-financial conflicts of interest" in health and medicine.

The AGREE II provides a domain termed "editorial independence", which evaluates whether funding bodies have influenced the content and if the conflicts of interest of CPG development group members have been recorded and addressed. Our study showed that the "editorial independence" domain achieved a mean score of only 35.26% for pediatric CPGs. Furthermore, several previous studies highlighted that the "editorial independence" domain of AGREE II in pediatric CPGs displayed inappropriate quality, with a mean score of 17–48%.

### A pediatric virtual care evaluation framework and its evolution using consensus methods [^116f1snT]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

The framework domains and sub-domains are detailed as follows:

- **Health outcomes**: The first domain includes clinical measures of individual and population health within three sub-domains: physical, mental and behavioral, and quality of life (QoL). This domain aligns with the ultimate goal of helping children and youth achieve their best life by encompassing direct health measures and the impact of health status on the quality of life of patients and caregivers. "Behavioral" was added to the mental health sub-domain to ensure that our framework is relevant for programs delivering developmental and behavioral health services (e.g. applied behavior analysis, complex care) and provides a holistic view of the impact of virtual care on pediatric health outcomes. Data sources are primarily patient charts, assuming patient and caregiver self-reports and other measures of QoL are included therein. Comparators include internal or external databases or clinical practice guidelines, depending on the evaluation questions. Table 1 provides example evaluation questions for the physical health outcomes sub-domain along with associated measures, data sources, and bases of comparison.

- **Health delivery**: This second domain includes five sub-domains: access to care, privacy, safety, efficiency, and effectiveness of care delivery. We have defined the scope of these sub-domains as follows. Access to care considers both timeliness (e.g. time to first visit, wait times) and equity (e.g. to what extent the program provides equitable access to care or addresses access or equity gaps present in other programs).

### Establishing new norms for developmental milestones [^114gMjKM]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Pediatric surveillance of young children depends on providers' assessment of developmental milestones, yet normative data are sparse. Our objectives were to develop new norms for common milestones to aid in clinical interpretation of milestone attainment.

- **Methods**: We analyzed responses to the developmental screening form of the Survey of Well-being of Young Children from 41,465 screens across 3 states. Associations between developmental status and a range of child characteristics were analyzed, and norms for individual questions were compared to guidelines regarding attainment of critical milestones from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

- **Results**: A contemporary resource of normative data for developmental milestone attainment was established. Lower developmental status was associated with child age in the presence of positive behavioral screening scores (P < .01), social determinants of health (P < .01), Medicaid (P < .01), male sex (P < .01), and child race (P < .01). Comparisons between Survey of Well-being of Young Children developmental questions and CDC guidelines reveal that a high percentage of children are reported to pass milestones by the age at which the CDC states that "most children pass" and that an even higher percentage of children are reported to pass milestones by the age at which the CDC states that parents should "act early". An interactive data visualization tool that can assist clinicians in real-time developmental screening and surveillance interpretation is also provided.

### Well-child visits for infants and young children [^117HJwcY]. American Family Physician (2018). Low credibility.

The well-child visit allows for comprehensive assessment of a child and the opportunity for further evaluation if abnormalities are detected. A complete history during the well-child visit includes information about birth history, prior screenings, diet, sleep, dental care, and medical, surgical, family, and social histories. A head-to-toe examination should be performed, including a review of growth. Immunizations should be reviewed and updated as appropriate.

Screening for postpartum depression in mothers of infants up to six months of age is recommended. Based on expert opinion, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends developmental surveillance at each visit, with formal developmental screening at nine, 18, and 30 months, and autism-specific screening at 18 and 24 months. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force found insufficient evidence to make a recommendation.

Well-child visits provide the opportunity to answer parents' or caregivers' questions and to provide age-appropriate guidance. Car seats should remain rear-facing until two years of age or until the height or weight limit for the seat is reached. Fluoride use, limiting or avoiding juice, and weaning to a cup by 12 months of age may improve dental health. A one-time vision screening between three and five years of age is recommended by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force to detect amblyopia.

The American Academy of Pediatrics guideline, based on expert opinion, recommends that screen time be avoided, with the exception of video chatting, in children younger than 18 months and limited to one hour per day for older children.

### Evaluation of a learning collaborative to improve the delivery of preventive services by pediatric practices [^115dNKDi]. Pediatrics (2006). Low credibility.

Effective delivery of preventive services is an essential component of high-quality pediatric health care. However, both variation in and deviation from accepted guidelines have been reported. Learning collaboratives (LCs) have been shown to result in improvement in several aspects of pediatric care. The objective of this study was to determine whether pediatric practices that participated in a preventive services LC would improve their delivery of preventive services.

- **Methods**: After conducting an initial audit of the medical records of twenty 2-year-olds and twenty 4-year-olds for documentation of preventive services based on national standards, practice teams attended a quality improvement workshop. They were presented with evidence to support the value of preventive services and the results of their audits and taught quality improvement methods, such as rapid cycles of change. Each team developed plans to improve one or more services. Brief audits with feedback and monthly conference calls were used to support practices to conduct rapid cycles of change, to discuss barriers and solutions, and to monitor progress. The results of final chart audits of twenty 2-year-olds and 4-year-olds were compared with the initial chart audits. A preventive service score (PSS) was assigned to each practice based on the number of services provided, and initial to final comparisons were made.

- **Results**: Fourteen practices participated. PSSs improved for all practices after the LC. The mean PSS for 2-year-olds increased from 4.0 ± 1.1 to 4.9 ± 1.2, and for 4-year-olds, increases were noted as well.

### A children's book for emergent literacy screening during well-child visits [^112zqNBQ]. Pediatrics (2019). Low credibility.

The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends literacy promotion and developmental assessment during well-child visits. Emergent literacy skills are well defined, and the use of early screening has the potential to identify children at risk for reading difficulties and guide intervention before kindergarten.

- **Methods**: The Reading House (TRH) is a children's book designed to screen emergent literacy skills. These are assessed by sharing the book with the child and using a 9-item, scripted scoring form. Get Ready to Read! (GRTR) is a validated measure shown to predict reading outcomes. TRH and GRTR were administered in random order to 278 children (mean: 43.1 ± 5.6 months; 125 boys, 153 girls) during well-child visits at 7 primary care sites. Parent, child, and provider impressions of TRH were also assessed. Analyses included Rasch methods, Spearman-ρ correlations, and logistic regression, including covariates age, sex, and clinic type.

- **Results**: Psychometric properties were strong, including item difficulty and reliability. Internal consistency was good for new measures (rCo- α = 0.68). The mean TRH score was 4.2 (± 2.9; range: 0–14), and mean GRTR was 11.1 (± 4.4; range: 1–25). TRH scores were positively correlated with GRTR scores (r s = 0.66; high), female sex, private practice, and child age (P < .001). The relationship remained significant controlling for these covariates (P < .05). The mean TRH administration time was 5:25 minutes (± 0:55; range: 3:34–8:32). Parent, child, and provider impressions of TRH were favorable.

- **Conclusions**: TRH is a feasible, valid method for assessing emergent literacy skills during well-child visits.

### Quality of pediatric clinical practice guidelines [^111GE7Zm]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Low credibility.

The AGREE II consists of 23 key items in six domains to capture different dimensions of clinical practice guideline (CPG) quality, which include scope and purpose (items 1–3), stakeholder involvement (items 4–6), rigor of development (items 7–14), clarity of presentation (items 15–17), applicability (items 18–21), and editorial independence (items 22–23). Each item is assigned a score from 1 (strongly disagree, when no given information is relevant) to 7 (strongly agree, when full criteria of the item are met). The more criteria that are met, the higher the scores that are given.

According to the AGREE II instrument, scores of each domain are calculated as follows: the difference between maximum possible score and minimum possible score divided by the difference between actually obtained score and minimum possible score. Furthermore, according to the instrument, the reviewers provided two overall assessments of the CPG based on the quality of the six domains. The reviewers assigned an overall quality score from 1 to 7 (higher scores indicating higher quality) by taking into account the total scores from each of the six domains as well as personal judgment made by the reviewers. If the overall assessment scores given by these two reviewers differed by 1 point, the lower score was assigned; if it varied by 2 points, the average score was assigned; and if it differed by 3 or more points, the reviewers revisited for agreement. To reach the recommended level, CPGs had to achieve overall assessment scores of 6 and 7 (above 80% of 7 scores). With an overall score of 4 and 5 (60 to 80% of 7 scores), the level was "recommended with modifications".

### Evaluating the implementation of expert committee recommendations for obesity assessment [^1131V2wp]. Clinical Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

The increasing prevalence of childhood overweight and obesity, along with their associated morbidities, is well established. However, rates of diagnosis and screening for related conditions by clinicians remain low. In 2007, expert committee recommendations were released to facilitate the management of pediatric overweight and obesity. From well-child visits to a Massachusetts multisite group practice, we randomly selected one visit per child in 2006 (n = 56,374) and in 2008 (n = 69,681), using electronic health record data to identify children with incident overweight or obesity (BMI ≥ 85th percentile). We ascertained whether clinicians assigned relevant ICD-9 (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision) codes and ordered laboratory tests recommended for children aged 10 years and older.

In the year following the release of recommendations, a large majority of children aged 2 to 17 years with a BMI ≥ 85th percentile lacked diagnosis codes for overweight and obesity. Additionally, recommended laboratory orders for the assessment of obesity-related comorbidities for children 10 years and older were not consistently made. This suggests the need to improve approaches to increase the uptake of guidelines.

### Consensus definition of essential, optimal, and suggested components of a pediatric sickle cell disease center [^114zW7Br]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2023). High credibility.

Sickle cell disease (SCD) requires coordinated, specialized medical care for optimal outcomes. There are no United States (US) guidelines that define a pediatric comprehensive SCD program. We report a modified Delphi consensus-seeking process to determine essential, optimal, and suggested elements of a comprehensive pediatric SCD center. Nineteen pediatric SCD specialists participated from the US. Consensus was predefined as two-thirds agreement on each element's categorization. Twenty-six elements were considered essential (required for guideline-based SCD care), ten were optimal (recommended but not required), and five were suggested. This work lays the foundation for a formal recognition process of pediatric comprehensive SCD centers.

### Dyslipidemia screening of 9- to 11-year-olds at well-child visits by Utah pediatricians [^115TPLFa]. Clinical Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

In 2011, an expert National Institutes of Health panel published the "Integrated Guidelines for CV Health and Risk Reduction in Children and Adolescents", which recommended screening all children aged 9 to 11 years for dyslipidemia. It is unknown if this guideline is being followed. We surveyed members of the Utah chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics to determine whether they performed universal lipid screening at well-child visits (WCV) on their patients at 9, 10, or 11 years and how comfortable they were with evaluating and/or managing children with dyslipidemia.

Of the 118 respondents who practiced primary care, only 18 (15%) screened all children at WCV; 86 (73%) tested "some", most commonly children who were obese or had a positive family history. Eighteen percent were unfamiliar with the guidelines; 28% were familiar with the guidelines but felt they were "inappropriate"; 98 (84%) of the respondents said they were "very or somewhat comfortable" evaluating children with dyslipidemia.

### The quality of ambulatory care delivered to children in the United States [^114sdm6C]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Little is known about the magnitude of deficits in the quality of care delivered to children, since comprehensive studies have been lacking.

- **Methods**: We assessed the extent to which care processes recommended for pediatric outpatients are delivered. Quality indicators were developed using the RAND-UCLA modified Delphi method. Parents of 1536 children randomly selected from 12 metropolitan areas provided written informed consent to obtain medical records from all providers who had seen the children during the 2-year period before the date of study recruitment. Trained nurses abstracted these medical records. Composite quality scores were calculated by dividing the number of times indicated care was documented as having been ordered or delivered by the number of times a care process was indicated.

- **Results**: On average, according to the medical records, children in the study received 46.5% (95% confidence interval, 44.5 to 48.4) of the indicated care. They received 67.6% (95% CI, 63.9 to 71.3) of the indicated care for acute medical problems, 53.4% (95% CI, 50.0 to 56.8) of the indicated care for chronic medical conditions, and 40.7% (95% CI, 38.1 to 43.4) of the indicated preventive care. Quality varied according to the clinical area, with the rate of adherence to indicated care ranging from 92.0% (95% CI, 89.9 to 94.1) for upper respiratory tract infections to 34.5% (95% CI, 31.0 to 37.9) for preventive services for adolescents.

- **Conclusions**: Deficits in the quality of care provided to children appear to be similar in magnitude to.

### Quality of reporting and evidence in American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines [^116gyz7t]. Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

The primary objectives were to evaluate the quality of development and reporting of American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) guidelines and to determine the level of evidence underlying the recommendations.

- **Methods**: Two reviewers scored each guideline using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II (AGREE-II) instrument and determined the level of evidence for each recommendation. Subgroup analyses compared AAP guidelines published before and after key changes in AAP guideline development policy and compared internal with endorsed guidelines.

- **Results**: For the 28 guidelines, the highest average scores on AGREE-II were in scope and purpose (75%) and clarity of presentation (73%). The lowest average scores were in editorial independence (17%) and applicability (30%). The only domain that improved after AAP policy updates was editorial independence (P = 0.01). Of the 190 treatment recommendations, 43% were based on experimental studies, 30% on observational studies, and 27% on expert opinion or no reference. Compared with early guidelines, later guidelines included a higher proportion of treatment recommendations based on experimental studies (P = 0.05).

- **Conclusions**: There was no clear improvement in the quality of development and reporting of AAP clinical practice guidelines over time. Routine application of AGREE-II to guideline development could enhance guideline quality. The proportion of guideline recommendations based on experimental evidence has increased slightly over time.

### Assessing health system provision of well-child care: The Promoting Healthy Development Survey [^111MfjtX]. Pediatrics (2001). Low credibility.

Preventive care guidelines for children include parent education and counseling, developmental assessment, and screening for psychosocial and safety risks. Health care providers are in a unique position to identify and follow up on potential problems and to influence parenting knowledge, attitudes, and behavior to ensure the healthy development of young children. Few quality measures are available to assess health care system performance in this important area.

- **Objective**: To develop a feasible, valid, and reliable methodology for evaluating health care system performance in providing family-centered anticipatory guidance and child and family assessment services on behalf of children from birth through 48 months old.

- **Methods**: The Promoting Healthy Development Survey (PHDS) was developed and tested with a diverse group of families in 3 managed care organizations (n = 1478). A standard mail administration protocol was used, including an informed consent with a waiver of documentation, two mailings, a postcard reminder, and telephone reminders. The 36-item parent survey assesses whether health care providers (1) talk with parents about topics recommended in Bright Futures and the American Academy of Pediatrics Guidelines for Health Supervision, (2) provide follow-up for children who may be at risk for developmental problems, and (3) address psychosocial well-being and safety within the family. The PHDS also assesses the degree to which parents' interactions with providers are family-centered, helpful, and facilitate parental confidence.

### AAP updates recommendations for routine preventive pediatric health care [^111APPVN]. American Family Physician (2016). High credibility.

The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) has released updated recommendations for routine preventive pediatric health care. These updates, effective January 2017, provide guidance on various aspects of pediatric care, focusing on promoting optimal health outcomes for children and adolescents.

- **Key updates**: The new guidelines introduce several changes aimed at enhancing the effectiveness of preventive care. These changes include revised schedules for developmental screenings and the introduction of new recommendations for mental health assessments.

- **Mental health screenings**: A significant addition is the emphasis on early mental health screenings. The AAP advocates for incorporating mental health evaluations into regular check-ups to identify and address potential issues early in a child's development.

Overall, the updated guidelines are a comprehensive effort to align pediatric preventive care with the latest research findings and clinical practices. These changes underscore the importance of adapting health care practices to evolving scientific insights, ensuring children receive the highest standard of care.

### A directed content analysis of discussions between mothers and pediatricians around feeding and growth topics during infant well-child visits [^114aHPfE]. Clinical Pediatrics (2025). Low credibility.

Pediatricians reported growth as an important topic to discuss, with growth tracking (e.g. following a percentile curve) discussed more often than size references (e.g. "too big"). Despite pediatricians reporting high importance for growth discussions, in-depth conversations were sparse and often came in the form of updates, leaving some mothers with little guidance. Although a brief mention of infant growth percentiles may be sufficient for some families, providing updates alone may limit opportunities for engagement in more in-depth discussions to address questions or concerns or provide evidence-based guidance.

Given the strong link between infant growth rates and future health outcomes, it is critical that pediatricians prioritize these discussions and provide ample in-depth guidance as early as possible. Equipping mothers with a deeper understanding of the factors that influence growth can facilitate opportunities for closer monitoring and disease prevention. This is particularly important for first-time mothers, who are often less familiar with developmental milestones and growth charts compared to multiparous mothers. Thus, future research should investigate optimal avenues to provide parents with additional evidence-based guidance around growth and the ability to ask in-depth questions.

Previous studies are limited by cross-sectional designs, self-report bias, and limited depth on the general topics discussed. In this study, audio-recorded conversations and a longitudinal design allowed for a more detailed and rigorous analysis, with comparisons drawn on topics discussed.

### "Are you available for the next 18 months?" - Methods and aims of a longitudinal birth cohort study investigating a universal developmental surveillance program: The 'Watch Me Grow' study [^114LtD5r]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Universal developmental surveillance programs aimed at early identification and targeted early intervention significantly improve short- and long-term outcomes in children at risk of developmental disorders. However, a significant challenge remains in providing sufficiently rigorous research and robust evidence to inform policy and service delivery. This paper describes the methods of the 'Watch Me Grow' study that aims to maximize accurate early detection of children with developmental disorders through a partnership formed between policymakers, service providers, and researchers.

- **Methods/design**: A mixed methods study design was developed consisting of: (1) a qualitative study of parents and health service providers to investigate barriers and enablers of developmental surveillance; (2) recruitment of a birth cohort and their longitudinal follow-up to 18 months of age to: (a) assess risk factors for not accessing existing developmental surveillance programs and (b) estimate the prevalence of children identified with developmental risk; (3) comparison of surveillance outcomes with a reference standard at 18 months of age to assess the diagnostic test accuracy of existing and alternative developmental surveillance tools; and (4) comparison of developmental surveillance models to inform policy recommendations. Data linkage will be used to determine the uptake and representativeness of the study participant group versus non-participants.

- **Discussion**: The Watch Me Grow study is expected to provide a collaborative opportunity to enhance universal developmental surveillance programs by improving early identification practices and facilitating evidence-based policy recommendations, ultimately benefiting children at risk of developmental disorders.

### Ten recommendations for child-friendly visiting policies in critical care [^111HUf9V]. Intensive Care Medicine (2023). Low credibility.

**Plan the visit of children in the interprofessional team**: First, patients (if conscious), parents, children, and clinicians agree to the visit. Parents and caregivers play a central role in the whole process. Involved clinicians plan the visit step-by-step, document it as a daily goal, and communicate it to the team, patient, and family. Any necessary support from psychosocial professionals is requested in advance.

### Guiding principles for team-based pediatric care [^1154Cvic]. Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recognizes that children's unique and ever-changing needs depend on a variety of support systems. Key components of effective support systems address the needs of the child and family in the context of their home and community and are dynamic so that they reflect, monitor, and respond to changes as the needs of the child and family change. The AAP believes that team-based care involving medical providers and community partners (e.g. teachers and state agencies) is a crucial and necessary component of providing high-quality care to children and their families. Team-based care builds on the foundation of the medical home by reaching out to a potentially broad array of participants in the life of a child and incorporating them into the care provided.

Importantly, the AAP believes that a high-functioning team includes children and their families as essential partners. The overall goal of team-based care is to enhance communication and cooperation among the varied medical, social, and educational partners in a child's life to better meet the global needs of children and their families, helping them to achieve their best potential. In support of the team-based approach, the AAP urges stakeholders to invest in infrastructure, education, and privacy-secured technology to meet the needs of children. This statement includes limited specific examples of potential team members, including healthcare providers and community partners, that are meant to be illustrative and in no way represent a complete or comprehensive listing of all team members.

### Effect of an electronic health record transition on the provision of recommended well child services in pediatric primary care practices [^115o1VkD]. Clinical Pediatrics (2020). Low credibility.

We sought to determine the effect of transitioning between electronic health record (EHR) systems on the quality of preventive care in a large pediatric primary care network. To study this, we performed a retrospective chart analysis of 42 primary care practices from the Pediatric Physicians' Organization at Children's, who transitioned EHRs. We reviewed 24 random encounters per week distributed evenly across six age categories before, during, and following a transition period. We reviewed encounter documentation for age-appropriate well-child services, as per American Academy of Pediatrics/Bright Futures guidelines. Logistic regression and statistical process control analysis were used. In the pre-transition period, 84.5% of all recommended elements were documented versus 86.4% post-transition (P = 0.04). Documentation of age-appropriate anticipatory guidance showed significant positive change (69.0% to 80.2%, P = 0.005), but it was the only subdomain with a statistically significant increase. These increases suggest that EHR transitions have the opportunity to affect the delivery of preventive care.

### Pediatrician and parental evaluation of child neurodevelopment at 2 years of age [^116wxFTX]. BMC pediatrics (2024). Low credibility.

For the pediatric assessment, family practitioners (FPs), in addition to routine questions on physical growth and healthcare checks, fill in the CDC's Learn the Signs, Act Early Milestones (LTSAE) Checklist at two years. This checklist was adapted from the American Academy of Pediatrics' Bright Futures Developmental Milestones checklist. To follow the Istituto Superiore di Sanità (Italian National Institute of Health – ISS) recommendations, four questions included in the 18–24 months checklist were added to the CDC checklist:

- **The child walks alone, kicks the ball, or other object**.
- **The child gets off the ground without support**.
- **The child holds a pencil or stick and scribbles on paper or the ground/floor**.
- **When the child is denied something and/or has reactions of frustration, he can usually be calmed down quickly**.

Moreover, two additional questions on the child's development were included. The first one investigated the loss of competencies compared to the previous assessment, while the second one was related to the detection of hyperactivity signs by the FP.

FPs identified toddlers as "positive" for high risk if the total number of items that failed during the FP's assessment was ≥ 8. This cutoff was defined by classifying scores in percentiles and considering those above the 95th percentile as a warning sign.

For the parental assessment, parents filled in the "Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers, Revised" (M-CHAT-R), a screening tool for the early detection of warning signs in children, validated in Italian by Salomone, Cecil, and Muratori (2014).

### Effectiveness of targeted anticipatory guidance during well-child visits: a pilot trial [^1142uo6s]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Anticipatory guidance, an important function of well-child visits, is often brief and not tailored to parents' concerns. This targeted pilot trial evaluated a new method of anticipatory guidance.

- **Methods**: Using an experimental/control study design, we surveyed 137 parents and 31 physicians, comparing their responses to targeted anticipatory guidance (physician-provided education based on parents' concerns) versus usual anticipatory guidance (standard physician lecture on parenting, safety, and nutritional topics).

- **Results**: Overall, physicians appeared less satisfied than parents with the educational component of well-child visits, and they desired changes in the educational aspect of these visits. While physicians believed the targeted approach was easier, control group parents appeared more satisfied with usual anticipatory guidance. The number of anticipatory guidance topics covered in the control group was less than half of that covered in the experimental group.

- **Conclusions**: Our targeted method of anticipatory guidance during well-child visits covered more educational topics and resulted in visits that were easier for physicians but less satisfactory for parents. Further research is needed to identify methods of anticipatory guidance that are effective and satisfactory for both parents and physicians.

### Quality of evidence-based pediatric guidelines [^112frcF1]. Pediatrics (2005). Low credibility.

To identify evidence-based pediatric guidelines and assess their quality, we conducted a comprehensive search using Medline, Embase, and relevant websites of guideline development programs and national pediatric societies. This search aimed to identify evidence-based pediatric guidelines. A list of the identified guideline titles was sent to 51 leading pediatricians in the Netherlands, who were asked to select the five most urgent topics for guideline development. Subsequently, three pediatrician reviewers appraised the available guidelines on the ten most frequently mentioned topics using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE) instrument.

A total of 215 evidence-based pediatric guidelines were identified. Of these, 17 guidelines on the ten most frequently mentioned topics were appraised. The AGREE instrument evaluates guidelines across six domains. For the scope and purpose domain, the mean score was 84% of the maximal mark. Regarding stakeholder involvement, the mean score was 42%, with 12 guidelines (71%) scoring less than 50%. In terms of rigor of development, the mean score was 54%, with five guidelines (29%) scoring less than 50%. For clarity and presentation, the mean score was 78%, with four guidelines (24%) scoring less than 50%. Applicability and editorial independence scored poorly, with mean scores of 19% and 40%, respectively. Low scores were partly attributable to poor reporting. After assessing all domain scores, reviewers recommended 14 of the 17 guidelines (82%) for use in local practice.

The volume of pediatric guidelines categorized as evidence based in popular databases is substantial.

### Delivery of well-child care: A look inside the door [^1156WSfP]. Academic Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

- **Objective**: To describe the delivery of well-child care and its components; to compare that delivery with recommendations in Bright Futures; and to compare delivery of well-child care for children with special health care needs with that for children without special needs.

- **Methods**: Over a 10-week period, 2 medical students observed and documented characteristics of well-child care visits by general pediatricians and midlevel pediatric providers. Parents completed a demographic questionnaire and a screener for children with special health care needs.

- **Results**: A total of 483 visits by 43 pediatricians and 9 midlevel providers with patients from 0 to 19 years of age were observed. The adjusted mean visit duration was 20.3 minutes; 38.9% of visits began with an open-ended question about parent/child concerns. A mean of 7.2 health supervision/anticipatory guidance topics were addressed per visit. Clinicians addressed a mean of 42% of Bright Futures-recommended age-specific health supervision/anticipatory guidance topics. Topics addressed less frequently than recommended included family support, parental well-being, behavior/discipline, physical activity, media screen time, risk reduction/substance use, puberty/sex, social-peer interactions, and violence. Shorter visits were associated with asking about parent/child concerns and with addressing greater proportions of recommended health supervision/anticipatory guidance topics. Well-child care visits with children with special health care needs were 36% longer than those with children without special needs and addressed a similar number of topics.

### Developmental screening: Is there enough time [^111KCQUh]. Clinical Pediatrics (2009). Low credibility.

The objectives of this study were to determine whether routine developmental screening lengthened well-child visits and was associated with changes in parent satisfaction and the report of anticipatory guidance. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends routine developmental screening in well-child care, but providers often cite time restraints as a limitation preventing its widespread adoption.

Visits before and after the implementation of routine screening were timed. Parents whose children were seen before or after screening began were contacted to query their perceptions of the visit. There was no change in visit lengths after the screener was included. With the inclusion of screening, more parents reported that their provider talked about their concerns and that their questions were answered. There were no changes in parent satisfaction ratings or reports of anticipatory guidance discussions.

The conclusion emphasizes that the perceived obstacle of routine screening requiring more time than pediatricians have should not prevent its adoption. Screening tools may empower some parents who are otherwise reluctant to raise concerns unsolicited.

### Pediatric preventive care: Population health and individualized care [^115fZmn2]. Pediatrics (2021). Low credibility.

Well-child care is a near-universal service for young children toward which a great deal of time and professional resources are devoted, but for which there is scant evidence of effectiveness in routine practice. It is composed of many components, the value of which likely varies with the quality of their provision and the needs and priorities of the children and families who receive them. Achieving more efficient and effective preventive care will require that pediatric practices segment the population they serve and design schedules and staffing to match patients' health, well-being, personal and social circumstances, and service needs. Care should be individualized and include essential screening, tests, procedures, and education on the basis of assessment of patients' and families' needs and priorities.

The traditional schedule of individual, comprehensive preventive care visits should be reconsidered and replaced with a schedule that allows complete care to be provided over a series of visits, including those for acute and chronic care. Preventive pediatric care should be provided in family-centered, team-based practices with strong linkages to other providers in the community who serve and support children and families. Care should make use of the wide variety of modalities that exist, and face-to-face time should be reserved for those services that are both important and uniquely responsive to in-office intervention. This model of preventive care will require changes in training, responsibilities, and reimbursement of health care team members, as well as enhanced communication.

### Quality of pediatric clinical practice guidelines [^116gDM12]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Low credibility.

- **Guideline selection and characteristics**: Overall, the search identified 2,667 records, and 515 records were deleted through the software-assisted duplicates elimination process. During screening, 1,474 records were excluded: 712 records were not CPGs, 154 records were duplicates, and 608 records did not focus on pediatrics. After including 22 records from references and citations and excluding 484 records (168 records were not CPGs, 23 records were duplicates, 58 records did not publish between 2017 to 2019, and 235 records did not focus on pediatrics) in the full-text analysis, a total of 216 pediatric CPGs were used.

Among these CPGs, 71.3% were compiled by developed countries or regions; 85.65% of them were created through organizations or groups. Three-quarters of included CPGs used evidence-based methods to develop CPGs, while one-quarter did not. Detailed selection procedures are shown in Fig. 1.

### Assessing development in the pediatric office [^1163M6HY]. Pediatrics (2004). Low credibility.

To determine the proportion of children aged 10 to 35 months who were reported to have ever received a developmental assessment (DA), the study examines characteristics of the child, family, and health care setting associated with the receipt of a DA.

The National Survey of Early Childhood Health, conducted in 2000, surveyed 2,068 parents of children aged 4 to 35 months. Children were classified as having received a DA if parents were either told by the child's pediatric provider that a "developmental assessment" was being conducted or if parents recalled explicit components of a DA, such as stacking blocks or throwing a ball. The parent-reported receipt of a DA was assessed in relation to child and family characteristics, health care access, other measures of health care content and process, and measures of quality and satisfaction.

Approximately 57% of children aged 10 to 35 months had ever received a DA. Forty-two percent of parents recalled being told by their child's pediatric provider that a DA was being conducted, while 39% recalled their child's being asked to perform specific tasks typically included in a DA. Bivariate analysis indicates that the receipt of a DA is not associated with child or family sociodemographic characteristics, such as maternal education and household income, with the exception of race/ethnicity. Less acculturated Hispanic parents reported a higher incidence of DA than parents in other racial/ethnic groups (66% vs 56%). A smaller proportion of parents whose children used community health centers reported…

### Ten recommendations for child-friendly visiting policies in critical care [^112TqeNn]. Intensive Care Medicine (2023). High credibility.

**Recommendation 9: Integrate quality and risk management**: Proactive quality and risk management, alongside structured quality control, are essential for the successful implementation of children's visits to the ICU. Potential contraindications should be discussed and considered. Children's visits can be defined as part of a protocol to determine the desired quality of the visit and the process.

### Hypertension screening during healthcare pediatric visits [^1115qdXr]. Journal of Hypertension (2015). Low credibility.

Guidelines in both Europe and the United States recommend screening for hypertension during child care pediatric visits for children above 3 years old. The aims of the study were to assess the frequency of blood pressure (BP) measurement during preventive or chronic care pediatric visits and determine the factors that may associate with screening.

- **Method**: We prospectively included in the study consecutive children hospitalized in our department. Anthropometric measurements were performed in all children. Office BP was measured in children above 5 years old and for their mothers and/or fathers. Personal and family history, along with self-reported BP screening during pediatric visits, were recorded.

- **Results**: Hypertension screening had been performed at least once in 45.3% of the children during pediatric visits. Fifty percent of the children with elevated BP levels had never been screened for hypertension. Low birth weight, history of prematurity, or chronic disease was not associated with increased frequency of screening, whereas screening was more likely in children above 3 years old with a positive personal history (odds ratio 2.35, 95% confidence interval 1.07–5.15, P < 0.05). Obesity tended to increase the frequency of hypertension screening at all ages (odds ratio 2.60, 95% confidence interval 0.93–7.28, P = 0.06). Moreover, 37.5% of children without a positive personal history exhibited BP levels above the 90th percentile, and 13.5% of mothers and 31.1% of fathers were not aware of their own elevated BP levels.

### 2017 recommendations for preventive pediatric health care [^117SQv5C]. Pediatrics (2017). High credibility.

The 2017 recommendations for preventive pediatric health care (Periodicity Schedule) have been approved by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and represent a consensus of the AAP and the Bright Futures Periodicity Schedule Workgroup. Each child and family is unique; therefore, these recommendations are designed for the care of children who are receiving competent parenting, have no manifestations of any important health problems, and are growing and developing satisfactorily. Developmental, psychosocial, and chronic disease issues for children and adolescents may require frequent counseling and treatment visits separate from preventive care visits. Additional visits also may become necessary if circumstances suggest variations from normal.

### Healthy steps: A case study of innovation in pediatric practice [^114dX37b]. Pediatrics (2004). Low credibility.

Healthy Steps (HS) represents a significant innovation in the way pediatric primary care can be delivered. Based on the standards and principles of Bright Futures and the American Academy of Pediatrics Health Supervision Guidelines, HS enhances and expands traditional pediatric care by including a child development specialist (Healthy Steps specialist) as part of the pediatric practice team. Services offered by this person, typically a nurse, early childhood educator, or social worker, include more time to spend discussing preventive issues during well-child visits, home visits, a telephone information line exclusively addressing developmental and behavioral concerns, new written materials, and more seamless linkages to community resources and parent support groups.

The original HS cohort consisted of 15 pediatric practices in a variety of settings, including private practices, health centers, and pediatric training programs. Evaluated for the effects of HS on their family were 3,737 intervention and comparison families. HS families received significantly more preventive and developmental services compared to families in the control group. HS families were also less likely to be dissatisfied with their pediatric primary care. Additionally, HS had a positive impact on parenting in many areas, including adherence to health visits, nutritional practices, developmental stimulation, appropriate disciplinary techniques, and correct sleeping position. Other outcome measures, such as initiation or duration of breastfeeding, child development knowledge, and sense of competence, were also assessed, although some were not fully detailed in this excerpt.

### Clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and treatment of children and adolescents with obesity [^11291DfP]. Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for childhood obesity, more specifically concerning the diagnosis, the AAP 2023 guidelines recommend diagnosing overweight and obesity in pediatric patients aged 2–18 years based on BMI and BMI percentiles using age- and sex-specific growth charts:

- **Overweight**: BMI ≥ 85th to < 95th percentile.
- **Obesity**: BMI ≥ 95th percentile.
- **Severe obesity**: BMI ≥ 120% of the 95th percentile for age and sex.

### Adherence to pediatric screening [^112Y6wrU]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). High credibility.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in the United States, causing 1 in 5 deaths in 2020. In recent years, recognition of the importance of CVD prevention in childhood has increased, as risk factors for CVD often present in childhood and persist into adulthood. Many resources are devoted to health promotion and preservation across the life course, with special focus on "Life's Essential Eight": a set of behavioral and biological factors including diet, physical activity, nicotine exposure, sleep, body mass index, blood lipids, blood glucose, and blood pressure.

Pediatric guidelines from many organizations, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, American Heart Association (AHA)/American College of Cardiology, American Diabetes Association, and National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, recommend preventive screenings in children and adolescents for several of these factors to encourage cardiovascular health early in life, as risk reduction can help delay progression toward clinical disease. These screenings, typically conducted at annual wellness visits, include height and weight to measure body mass index (BMI), systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP), non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol to screen for dyslipidemia, and fasting blood glucose or hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) to screen for type 2 diabetes. Healthcare professionals (HCPs) play a critical role in the adoption of these recommendations, preventing CVD in children and reducing long-term CVD-related health consequences.

### Pediatric screening urinalysis: A difference-in-differences analysis of how a 2007 change in guidelines impacted use [^111LafyA]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Screening urinalysis before and after the 2007 AAP policy statement:

Overall, the adjusted proportion of visits including screening urinalysis before the 2007 AAP policy statement was similar in preventive care visits by children aged 4–18 years and visits by young adults aged 19–32 years. The adjusted screening urinalysis proportions before and after the 2007 recommendation remained flat in child visits, from 20.4% before to 22.5% after, but increased in young adult visits, from 20.1% to 27.0%, resulting in a differential impact on child visits of -4.8 percentage points (95% confidence interval, -9.0 to -0.5, p = 0.03).

- **Stratified analysis by visit setting and patient gender**: In female child visits to private practices, adjusted screening urinalysis proportions differentially decreased by 7.6 percentage points (95% CI -13.7 to -1.5, p = 0.02). For male child visits to private practices, the proportions differentially decreased by 0.5 percentage points (95% CI -10.6 to 9.6, p = 0.93). In community health center visits by female children, proportions differentially decreased by 17.4 percentage points (95% CI -27.9 to -6.8, p = 0.001); in community health center visits by male children, proportions differentially decreased by 33.5 percentage points (95% CI -47.4 to -19.7, p < 0.001).

Of note, sample sizes were small for some cells, leading to imprecise estimates.

### Well-child care clinical practice redesign for serving low-income children [^112eDXXq]. Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Our objective was to conduct a rigorous, structured process to create a new model of well-child care (WCC) in collaboration with a multisite community health center and two small, independent practices serving predominantly Medicaid-insured children. Working groups of clinicians, staff, and parents (called "Community Advisory Boards" [CABs]) used (1) perspectives of WCC stakeholders and (2) a literature review of WCC practice redesign to create four comprehensive WCC models for children ages 0 to 3 years. An expert panel, following a modified version of the Rand/UCLA Appropriateness Method, rated each model for potential effectiveness on four domains: (1) receipt of recommended services, (2) family-centeredness, (3) timely and appropriate follow-up, and (4) feasibility and efficiency. Results were provided to the CABs for the selection of a final model to implement.

The newly developed models rely heavily on a health educator for anticipatory guidance and developmental, behavioral, and psychosocial surveillance and screening. Each model allots a small amount of time with the pediatrician to perform a brief physical examination and to address parents' physical health concerns. A secure web-based tool customizes the visit to parents' needs and facilitates pre-visit screening. Scheduled, non-face-to-face methods (text, phone) for parent communication with the health care team are also critical to these new models of care. A structured process that engages small community practices and community health centers in clinical practice redesign can produce comprehensive, site-specific, and innovative solutions.

### Clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and treatment of children and adolescents with obesity [^114nnd2Q]. Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for childhood obesity, specifically in the context of evaluating comorbidities, the AAP 2023 guidelines recommend obtaining a comprehensive patient history and conducting mental and behavioral health screenings. Additionally, they suggest the evaluation of social determinants of health, physical examination, and the following diagnostic studies for patients aged 2–18 years who are overweight or obese:

- **Dyslipidemia**: Obtain a fasting lipid panel to evaluate for dyslipidemia in adolescent and pediatric patients aged ≥ 10 years with obesity or overweight. Consider evaluating for lipid abnormalities in patients aged 2–9 years with obesity.

- **Diabetes**: Obtain fasting plasma glucose, 2-hour plasma glucose following a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test, or HbA1c to evaluate for abnormal glucose metabolism in adolescent and pediatric patients aged ≥ 10 years with obesity, or those with overweight in the presence of risk factors for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) or metabolic associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD).

- **MASLD**: Obtain an alanine transaminase measurement to evaluate for abnormal liver function in adolescent and pediatric patients aged ≥ 10 years with obesity, or those with overweight in the presence of risk factors for T2DM or MASLD.

- **Hypertension**: Measure blood pressure at every visit starting at 3 years of age to evaluate for hypertension in pediatric and adolescent patients with overweight and obesity.
