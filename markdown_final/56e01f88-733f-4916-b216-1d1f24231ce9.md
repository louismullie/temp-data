types of fundoplications

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the different types of fundoplication procedures and how they are categorized and described. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the major categories of fundoplication and related anti-reflux procedures. Then, I should verify the defining technical features of the common wraps (degree and orientation) and their typical indications. Next, I will review comparative efficacy and adverse effect profiles, cross-checking guideline positions and meta-analytic data. After that, I should consider patient selection nuances, including esophageal motility, hiatal hernia size, Barrett's esophagus, achalasia, and obesity. Finally, I will synthesize long-term outcomes and durability, and conclude with a concise, clinically oriented summary that reconciles areas where evidence appears conflicting or low quality.

> Let me first confirm the overarching categories. At first glance, I thought there were three primary groups, but wait, let me verify: there are actually four practical buckets clinicians use — conventional surgical fundoplications (open or laparoscopic), partial versus total wraps as minimally invasive surgical variants, endoscopic/transoral fundoplication (TIF), and adjunctive/alternative anti-reflux devices such as magnetic sphincter augmentation (MSA), which are not true fundoplications but often considered alongside them in decision-making and evidence syntheses [^116Lx6o7].

> I will now examine the classic complete fundoplication, the Nissen. The Nissen is a 360-degree wrap, typically posterior, and is widely regarded as the reference or "gold standard" in many comparative contexts; it provides robust reflux suppression with strong objective improvements in acid exposure and DeMeester scores, though with higher risks of gas-bloat and dysphagia compared to partial wraps according to randomized trials and meta-analyses; let me double-check that the more recent meta-analyses also show a larger average DeMeester improvement versus TIF and a modest edge versus Toupet, which they do, consistent with historical data and guideline positioning [^1143gjn4] [^112G6KnF] [^112G6KnF].

> Next, I should review the posterior partial wrap, the Toupet (approximately 270 degrees, posterior). Hold on, I should verify its advantages: Toupet tends to yield comparable symptom control to Nissen with a lower risk of postoperative dysphagia, and better preservation of the ability to belch/vomit; network meta-analysis estimates significantly lower odds of dysphagia versus 360-degree wraps, and long-term randomized follow-up suggests similar reflux control durability with fewer mechanical side effects, though differences narrow over decades [^116spx5P] [^112ZJDft] [^112G6KnF].

> Let me consider the anterior partial wraps, including Dor (about 180 degrees, anterior) and Watson (also typically 180 degrees, anterior). Wait, I should not jump to conclusions here because their roles differ: Dor is most often chosen as a buttress after Heller myotomy for achalasia rather than as a primary anti-reflux operation for typical GERD, whereas Watson has shown inferior physiologic reflux control versus Toupet in randomized data for GERD; long-term data have questioned the anterior approach's reflux control for primary GERD, favoring posterior partial wraps in that setting [^1178WfSQ] [^112FTJ76].

> Hmm, wait a minute — what about "90-degree" anterior wraps and other lesser wraps referenced in comparisons? I should confirm that the 90-degree and 180-degree anterior partials have appeared in randomized networks; those analyses suggested similar heartburn control versus 360-degree wraps but with lower dysphagia odds, albeit the certainty was low to moderate, and clinical uptake has favored posterior partials given more consistent physiologic control across studies [^116spx5P].

> I will now examine endoscopic or transoral incisionless fundoplication (TIF), especially TIF 2.0. Let me first confirm the indications: guidelines recommend considering TIF for patients with regurgitation-predominant symptoms who decline surgery and who do not have severe esophagitis (LA C/D) or hiatal hernia > 2 cm; ESGE cautions against TIF as a replacement for PPI therapy or surgical fundoplication except in selected mild GERD patients, which aligns with careful patient selection; outcomes show objective and symptomatic improvement but generally less DeMeester score improvement than Nissen, with low rates of serious adverse events and fewer gas-bloat/dysphagia symptoms in many series [^111R9p44] [^112kP3fA] [^1143gjn4] [^113gweD5] [^113hCTrs].

> But wait, what if a patient wants to avoid wraps entirely — should I discuss alternatives? Magnetic sphincter augmentation (MSA, LINX) is not a fundoplication but is often included in comparative analyses; it typically preserves the ability to belch/vomit and shows objective and subjective improvements similar to fundoplication options in pooled analyses, sometimes with favorable side-effect profiles; selection favors those without large hiatal hernias, and comparative meta-analytic summaries support its role alongside surgical fundoplication and TIF in modern anti-reflux therapy [^116Lx6o7] [^1143gjn4].

> Next, I should review comparative efficacy and reconcile apparently conflicting signals. The 2020 network meta-analysis suggested that 270-degree posterior and anterior partials could have similar heartburn control to 360-degree Nissen but with lower dysphagia risk; hold on, I should verify objective physiology: more recent multilevel meta-analyses indicate greater average DeMeester improvement after Nissen than after TIF and a modest advantage versus Toupet, suggesting that when disease is more severe, the complete wrap may confer stronger reflux suppression, which tracks with clinical experience and the association between worse baseline esophagitis and greater post-procedure physiologic gains [^116spx5P] [^1143gjn4].

> I need to ensure patient selection criteria are laid out clearly. For Nissen, I initially noted "severe esophagitis (LA grade A/B)" — wait, that is incorrect nomenclature because severe esophagitis is LA C/D; let me correct that: Nissen is often favored for patients with large hiatal hernias, severe esophagitis (LA C/D), Barrett's esophagus, regurgitation-predominant disease, and normal motility when maximal reflux control is prioritized; however, SAGES guidance cautions against tailoring the degree of wrap solely to preoperative manometry in the absence of achalasia, a point that tempers historical practice of defaulting to partial wraps for "ineffective motility" alone [^111PXSV2].

> For partial wraps, I should confirm preferred scenarios. Toupet is commonly selected when dysphagia risk is a concern or motility appears impaired, and in reoperative or elderly contexts given lower mechanical side effects; Dor is primarily paired with Heller myotomy in achalasia to protect the mucosa while offering reflux mitigation, though randomized data suggest both Dor and Toupet are acceptable post-myotomy; for primary GERD, posterior partials have shown more consistent reflux control than anterior partials in comparative trials, shaping current surgical preferences [^113iU4uf] [^113Qq6tT] [^1178WfSQ].

> I will now connect hiatal hernia repair and fundoplication. Hold on, I should verify guideline recommendations: during repair of sliding or paraesophageal hernias (type II–IV), guidelines recommend adding fundoplication to address reflux and restore competence; this aligns with contemporary SAGES guidance for incorporating a wrap at the time of hiatal hernia repair, with the choice of wrap individualized to anatomy and symptom profile [^1118XhUv].

> Let me consider special populations and alternative pathways. In Barrett's esophagus, fundoplication is associated with better disease regression and reduced progression versus medical therapy in meta-analysis, which informs discussions where maximal reflux control is desired; in lung transplant recipients with BOS and proven reflux, expert guidelines recommend referral to experienced surgeons to consider fundoplication given potential graft benefit; in patients with significant obesity, conversion to or primary Roux-en-Y gastric bypass may be preferred in selected scenarios due to reflux control and weight loss, and obese patients are overrepresented among those converted to RYGB after failed fundoplication in large series [^112Wuv1H] [^115VxhUL] [^113hLXvx] [^116ixVhJ].

> I need to check adverse effects and complications to balance efficacy. Common post-fundoplication syndromes include gas-bloat, dysphagia, and diarrhea, most improving over months; failures typically occur within two years and include herniation, slipped or tight wraps, and malposition; learning curves matter — early laparoscopic experience carried higher complication rates that improved with proficiency — which should be factored into outcomes counseling and center selection [^116oad6u] [^1129QuoU] [^1164zQKf].

> Next, I should review long-term durability and cost-effectiveness signals. Long-term randomized follow-up shows both total and partial posterior wraps maintain high reflux control with diminishing differences in side effects over time; surgery improves health status versus medical therapy in randomized trials, and at five years appears cost-effective in a pragmatic UK trial; multilevel meta-analyses reinforce durable improvements across procedures, with some heterogeneity and signals that greater baseline disease severity predicts larger physiologic gains [^112ZJDft] [^1179nYsv] [^1138NkFB] [^1143gjn4].

> Hold on, I should verify how to succinctly classify "types" for the user. In concise clinical terms: Nissen is a 360-degree complete fundoplication yielding maximal reflux suppression at the cost of higher dysphagia/gas-bloat risk; Toupet is a 270-degree posterior partial wrap balancing strong symptom control with lower dysphagia; Dor is a 180-degree anterior wrap, mainly used with Heller myotomy for achalasia; Watson is a 180-degree anterior wrap that has shown inferior reflux control versus posterior partials in GERD trials; TIF is an endoscopic partial fundoplication suited to small or absent hernias and non-severe esophagitis; MSA is an implant alternative preserving belching/vomiting, considered alongside fundoplications in modern GERD algorithms, with all selections tailored to anatomy, motility, symptom phenotype, and patient preference [^112FTJ76] [^1178WfSQ] [^111R9p44] [^116Lx6o7].

> To wrap up, let me reconsider that I have reconciled the evidence hierarchy and guidelines. Where evidence is low quality or conflicting — such as network equivalence of partial versus total wraps on heartburn versus objective physiologic superiority of complete wraps — I should emphasize shared decision-making and alignment with guidelines: reserve TIF for carefully selected patients without severe esophagitis or large hernias, avoid tailoring wrap solely on manometry in non-achalasia, favor posterior wraps over anterior for primary GERD, and escalate to alternatives like RYGB in selected obese or revisional contexts; this approach remains consistent with ACG and SAGES guidance and the best available meta-analytic data [^111R9p44] [^111PXSV2] [^116spx5P] [^1118XhUv].

Fundoplication procedures are classified by wrap degree and approach, with **Nissen (360°)** providing the most robust reflux control [^1143gjn4] but with a higher dysphagia risk [^112G6KnF], and **Toupet (270°)** or **Dor (180–200°)** offering comparable reflux control [^116spx5P] with fewer side effects [^112ZJDft]. Anterior partial wraps (90–180°) have fewer side effects but provide less durable reflux control [^1178WfSQ]. TIF is a **minimally invasive option** [^113gweD5] for select patients with a small or no hiatal hernia [^112kP3fA] and mild GERD [^111R9p44] [^117A8dEG]. Procedure selection should be **individualized** [^112xMC5x] based on reflux severity, esophageal motility, and patient preference [^111R9p44].

| **Attribute** | **Nissen** | **Toupet** | **Dor** | **Anterior partial** | **TIF** |
|-|-|-|-|-|-|
| Degree of wrap | 360° | 270° | 180–200° | 90–180° | 270° |
| Approach | Posterior | Posterior | Anterior | Anterior | Endoscopic |
| Indications | Severe GERD with normal motility | Weak motility or achalasia [^113iU4uf] | Heller myotomy [^113Qq6tT] | Mild GERD in patients at high dysphagia risk [^1178WfSQ] | Mild GERD with a small or no hernia [^111R9p44] |
| Advantages | Excellent reflux control [^1143gjn4] [^1179nYsv] | Lower dysphagia and good reflux control [^112G6KnF] [^112ZJDft] | Lower dysphagia and protection of the myotomy [^113iU4uf] [^113Qq6tT] | Fewer side effects [^112FTJ76] | Minimally invasive and low dysphagia [^113gweD5] [^113hCTrs] |
| Disadvantages | Higher dysphagia and gas-bloat [^112G6KnF] [^116oad6u] | Slightly higher reflux recurrence | Less effective reflux control [^113Qq6tT] | Less durable reflux control [^1178WfSQ] | Limited long-term data [^112kP3fA] |

Nissen fundoplication is best for **severe GERD with normal motility**, while **Toupet or Dor** are preferred for weak motility or after Heller myotomy [^113iU4uf] [^113Qq6tT]. Anterior partial wraps are suitable for mild GERD in patients at high dysphagia risk, and **TIF** is appropriate for select mild cases [^111R9p44] [^112kP3fA].

Regarding therapeutic procedures for gastroesophageal reflux disease, specifically concerning transoral incisionless fundoplication, the ACG 2022 guidelines recommend considering transoral incisionless fundoplication in patients with troublesome regurgitation or heartburn. This recommendation is for patients who do not wish to undergo antireflux surgery and do not have severe esophagitis (Los Angeles grade C or D) or hiatal hernias greater than 2 cm.

### Assessing the efficacy and safety of laparoscopic antireflux procedures for the management of gastroesophageal reflux disease: A systematic review with network meta-analysis [^116spx5P]. Surgical Endoscopy (2020). Low credibility.

Despite the extensive literature on laparoscopic antireflux surgery, comparative evidence across different procedures is scarce. The aim of this study was to assess and rank the most efficacious and safe laparoscopic procedures for the management of gastroesophageal reflux disease.

- **Methods**: Medline, Embase, AMED, CINAHL, CENTRAL, and OpenGrey databases were queried for randomized trials comparing two or more laparoscopic antireflux procedures with each other or with medical treatment for the management of gastroesophageal reflux disease. Pairwise meta-analyses were conducted for each pair of interventions using a random-effects model. Network meta-analysis was employed to assess the relative efficacy and safety of laparoscopic antireflux procedures for the management of gastroesophageal reflux disease.

- **Results**: Forty-four publications reporting 29 randomized trials, which included 1892 patients, were identified. The network of treatments was sparse with only a closed loop between different types of wraps: 270°, 360°, anterior 180°, and anterior 90°; and a star network between 360° and other treatments; and between anterior 180° and other treatments. Laparoscopic 270° (odds ratio [OR] 1.19, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.64–2.22), anterior 180°, and anterior 90° were equally effective as 360° for control of heartburn, though this finding was supported by low quality of evidence according to GRADE modification for NMA. The odds for dysphagia were lower after 270° (OR 0.38, 95% CI 0.24–0.60), anterior 90° (moderate quality evidence), and anterior 180° (low-quality evidence).

### Fundoplication significantly improves objective and subjective reflux outcomes-a meta-analysis [^1143gjn4]. Surgical Endoscopy (2025). High credibility.

A total of 31 unique studies provided 49 total follow-up observations from 2997 patients, of which 1195 (39.9%; 17 studies) underwent Nissen fundoplication, 971 (32.4%; 4 studies) underwent an MSA, 347 (11.6%; 6 studies) underwent TIF, and 204 (6.8%; 4 studies) underwent a Toupet fundoplication. The remaining 9.3% underwent an unspecified laparoscopic fundoplication. The multilevel meta-analysis model fit significantly better than the traditional meta-analysis (−2LL difference = 4.61, p = 0.032).

Significant between-study heterogeneity was observed, with much of the variability at the study level (Tau-squared: 19.51 at level 3 and 3.00 at level 2, Higgins–Thompson I²: 95.9% at level 3 and 2.3% at level 2). Undergoing a GERD procedure provided statistically significant improvement in DeMeester score (mean improvement: 30.65, 95% CI: 23.56 to 37.73, p < 0.001). Although statistically significant improvement was observed for all GERD procedures, Nissen fundoplication averaged greater mean improvement compared to TIF (mean difference: 20.72, 95% CI: 2.89 to 38.55, p = 0.023) and Toupet fundoplication (mean difference: 5.45, 95% CI: 0.97 to 9.92, p = 0.017); no other differences were statistically significant.

Meta-regression indicated that studies including a greater percent of patients with grade C or D esophagitis were associated with greater improvement.

### Fundoplication is superior to medical therapy for Barrett's esophagus disease regression and progression: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^112Wuv1H]. Surgical Endoscopy (2022). High credibility.

Fundoplication and medical management are mainstays for the management of Barrett's esophagus (BE); however, our understanding of the differences in outcomes between these two treatments is limited. The aim of this study was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy of these interventions on BE disease regression and progression.

- **Methods and procedures**: A comprehensive search in MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases was performed on February 22, 2021. Inclusion criteria were studies with both medical and surgical management comparators, BE diagnosis prior to treatment, patients aged ≥ 18 years, and studies with greater than five patients. Primary outcomes of interest included evaluating changes in histopathologic BE regression and disease progression between interventions. Meta-analysis was performed using a Mantel-Haenszel random-effects model (RevMan 5.4.1).

- **Results**: A total of 7,231 studies were retrieved after the initial search, with nine studies (1 randomized trial, 7 prospective cohorts, 1 retrospective cohort) meeting final inclusion criteria. Of the included studies, 890 (65%) patients received medical management, while 470 (35%) received surgical management. Medical management included proton pump inhibitors (n = 807, 91%; 6 studies), H2-receptor blockers (n = 40, 4% patients; 3 studies), and combination therapy (n = 43, 5%; 1 study). Nissen fundoplication was the most commonly performed type of fundoplication (n = 265, 93%). Median length of follow-up ranged from 1.5–7 years. Meta-analysis revealed that fundoplication was more effective in influencing disease outcomes.

### Five-year clinical outcomes of RefluxStop surgery in the treatment of acid reflux: A prospective multicenter trial of safety and effectiveness [^111VGGqN]. Surgical Endoscopy (2025). Low credibility.

Among the available fundoplication techniques, Nissen fundoplication was used for comparison since it is considered the gold standard, i.e. the standard of care, as per several clinical practice guidelines such as the 2022 American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) recommendations. RCTs and one systematic literature review with meta-analysis comparing Nissen and Toupet fundoplication indicated that, although there are some differences in postoperative dysphagia during short-term follow-up, outcomes appear to approximate after 1 year with no statistically significant difference in the long term. For instance, the randomized study by Qin et al, with 383 cases followed for 5.6 years, concluded that no symptom recurrence occurred following Nissen fundoplication, whereas 18 patients experienced symptom recurrence following Toupet fundoplication. Furthermore, the cure rate of esophagitis was superior in the Nissen group (88.4%) compared to the Toupet group (67.7%). The incidence of dysphagia between groups was comparable at 1 year postoperatively, i.e. 1.5% and 0.8%, respectively, supporting Nissen fundoplication's position as the standard of care.

An appropriate methodology for establishing de facto treatment effect involves validating patient-reported outcomes with objective testing. This study reports the first data of long-term (≥ 5 years) clinical outcomes using the novel RefluxStop procedure in the treatment of chronic GERD. Our report correlates subjective and objective outcomes for a comprehensive understanding of the long-term safety and effectiveness of RefluxStop surgery.

### Total or posterior partial fundoplication in the treatment of GERD: Results of a randomized trial after 2 decades of follow-up [^112ZJDft]. Annals of Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Objective and background - **The objective**: We lack long-term data (> 10 years) on the efficacy of antireflux surgery when evaluated within the framework of randomized clinical trials. Hereby, we report the outcome of a randomized trial comparing open total (I) and a Toupet posterior partial fundoplication (II) performed between 1983 and 1991.

Methods - **Study design**: One hundred thirty-seven patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease were enrolled in the study. The mean follow-up has now reached 18 years. During these years, 26% had died, and 16% were unable to be traced for follow-up. Symptom outcomes were assessed using validated self-reporting questionnaires.

Results - **Symptom control**: Long-term control of heartburn and acid regurgitation (reported as no or mild symptoms) were reported by 80% and 82% following a total fundoplication (I). Corresponding figures were 87% and 90% following a partial posterior fundoplication (II), respectively (not significant). The dysphagia scores were low: 4.6 ± 1.3 (SEM) in group I and 3.3 ± 0.9 (SEM) in group II (not significant). The point prevalences of rectal flatulence and gas distension-related complaints were of similar magnitude in the two groups. Twenty-three percent of the patients in the total fundoplication group noted some ability to vomit compared with 31% in the partial posterior fundoplication group.

Conclusions - **Reflux control**: Both a total and a partial posterior fundoplication maintain a high level of reflux control after two decades of follow-up. The previously reported differences in mechanical side effects, in favor of the partial wrap, seemed to disappear over time.

### Efficacy of an anterior as compared with a posterior laparoscopic partial fundoplication: Results of a randomized, controlled clinical trial [^112FTJ76]. Annals of Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

The study aimed to compare the efficacy and mechanical consequences of two partial fundoplications performed laparoscopically within the framework of a randomized, controlled clinical trial.

Although laparoscopic total fundoplication procedures have proven their effectiveness in controlling gastroesophageal reflux, challenges remain due to functional consequences following a supra-competent gastric cardia high-pressure zone. Partial fundoplications are associated with fewer mechanical side effects.

During a two-year period, 95 patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease were enrolled in a randomized, controlled single-institution clinical trial comparing a partial posterior (Toupét, n = 48) fundoplication and an anterior partial wrap (Watson, n = 47). All patients were assessed postoperatively at predefined time points, and the 12-month follow-up data are presented in terms of clinical results and 24-hour pH monitoring variables.

Both patient groups were strictly comparable at the time of randomization. All operations were completed laparoscopically, and no serious complications were encountered. During the first postoperative year, a difference regarding the control of reflux symptoms was observed in favor of the posterior fundoplication. Esophageal acid exposure (% time pH < 4) was substantially reduced by both operations, but to a significantly lower level following a Toupét compared with the Watson partial fundoplication (1.0 ± 0.3 vs. 5.6 ± 1.1 mean ± SEM; p < 0.001).

### Midterm follow-up evaluation following a novel approach to anterior fundoplication for achalasia [^111fBKd2]. Surgical Endoscopy (2006). Low credibility.

This study aimed to compare the outcomes for Heller myotomy alone and combined with different partial fundoplications.

- **Methods**: The authors retrospectively reviewed their experience with 69 laparoscopic myotomies and 14 Heller myotomies, 80% of which were performed with partial fundoplication including 20 Toupet, 18 Dor, and 17 modified Dor procedures, in which the fundoplication is sutured to both sides of the crura and not the myotomy.

- **Results**: The mean age of the study patients was 69 years (range, 15–80 years). Four mucosal perforations were repaired intraoperatively. There was one small bowel fistula in an area of open hernia repair distant from the myotomy. One patient with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease died of pneumonia. Phone follow-up evaluation was achieved in 68% of the cases at a mean of 37 months (range, 2–97 months). The results for no dysphagia and for heartburn requiring proton pump inhibitors, respectively, were as follows: Heller myotomy (85.7%, 28.5%), Toupet (66.6%, 33.3%), Dor (83.3%, 20%), and modified Dor (84.6%, 15.3%). Two patients with reflux strictures required annual dilation (Toupet, Dor). Two patients required revisions: one redo Heller myotomy (Dor) and one esophageal replacement (Toupet).

- **Conclusion**: Heller myotomy provides excellent dysphagia relief with or without fundoplication. Heartburn is a significant problem for a minority of patients. In the authors' hands, Toupet had the worst results and modified Dor was most protective for heartburn.

### Cost-effectiveness of laparoscopic fundoplication versus continued medical management for the treatment of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease based on long-term follow-up of the REFLUX trial [^1138NkFB]. The British Journal of Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Laparoscopic fundoplication surgery has been shown to be a cost-effective alternative to continued medical management over one year for patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD). However, the longer-term cost-effectiveness is uncertain. This study evaluated the long-term health benefits, costs, and cost-effectiveness of laparoscopic fundoplication compared with continued medical management in patients with GORD.

- **Methods**: Individual patient data were used from the five-year follow-up of the REFLUX trial, a large multicentre, pragmatic, randomized trial. In the trial, 357 patients with GORD for at least 12 months at trial entry were randomly allocated to early laparoscopic fundoplication or continued medical management. Health outcomes were expressed in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). A UK National Health Service perspective was used for costs.

- **Results**: The group randomized to surgery experienced better health outcomes in each year of follow-up, but the difference narrowed over time. At five years, the surgery group had experienced 0.216 (95 percent confidence interval 0.021 to 0.412) more QALYs but also accrued €1832 (1214 to 2448) more costs. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was €8481 per QALY gained. The probability that surgery is the most cost-effective intervention was 0.932 at a threshold of €24,134/QALY (£20,000/QALY). Results were robust to most sensitivity analyses, except where patients with missing data randomized to surgery were assumed to have worse health outcomes.

- **Conclusion**: Laparoscopic fundoplication is a cost-effective alternativ

### Guidelines for the management of hiatal hernia [^111WwgVG]. Surgical Endoscopy (2013). High credibility.

Regarding surgical interventions for hiatal hernia, especially technical considerations for surgery, the SAGES 2013 guidelines recommend performing fundoplication during the repair of a sliding type hiatal hernia to address reflux.

### Interventional anti-reflux management for gastro-oesophageal reflux disease in lung transplant recipients: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115oW2gP]. Surgical Endoscopy (2025). High credibility.

Comparison of fundoplication techniques:

There were seven studies in which Nissen fundoplication was the preferred surgical method. These included 205 patients, of whom 197 underwent a Nissen fundoplication. In comparison, there were five studies which included 307 patients, of whom 297 underwent a Toupet fundoplication.

Pooled analysis revealed a similar increase in FEV1 in those who underwent a Nissen fundoplication compared to the single study that reported on FEV1 changes in patients who underwent a Toupet fundoplication (0.125 L/s [95% CI; −0.016, 0.306] vs. 0.09 L/s [95% CI; −0.262, 0.442]) (I² = 0.0%). Changes in %FEV1 were also comparable in those who underwent a Nissen compared to those who underwent a Toupet fundoplication (−0.003% [95% CI −0.042, 0.035] vs. −0.001% [95% CI −0.045, 0.043], respectively [I² = 10.9%, 11.9%]). Contrastingly, those who underwent a Nissen fundoplication had a greater decrease in the rate of change of FEV1 of −2.353 mL/d (95% CI; −3.058, −1.649), compared to 0.056 mL/d (95% CI; −0.068, 0.180) in those who underwent a Toupet fundoplication (I² = 37.4%, 21.9%, respectively).

### Randomized controlled trial of robotic-assisted versus conventional laparoscopic fundoplication: 12 years follow-up [^1155Sdmg]. Surgical Endoscopy (2022). Low credibility.

Failure of treatment, as defined by Lundell, was not significantly different between robotic-assisted laparoscopic fundoplication (RALF) [46%, (6/13)] and conventional laparoscopic fundoplication (CLF) [33%, (4/12), p = 0.8063]. The signs of reflux recurrence and other details are documented in Table 2. The study population included two patients with a BMI above 35 at the time of primary surgery; neither showed treatment failure. Due to the small sample size, a subgroup analysis was not feasible.

Ralf robotic-assisted laparoscopic fundoplication and CLF conventional laparoscopic fundoplication were assessed for treatment outcomes. Quality of Life in Reflux and Dyspepsia (QOLRAD) was another consideration in evaluating patient outcomes.

### Guidelines for the management of hiatal hernia [^111PXSV2]. Surgical Endoscopy (2013). High credibility.

Regarding surgical interventions for hiatal hernia, especially in terms of technical considerations for the surgery fundoplication, the SAGES 2013 guidelines recommend not using preoperative manometric results to tailor fundoplication in the absence of achalasia.

### Fundoplication significantly improves objective and subjective reflux outcomes-a meta-analysis [^111hBmLm]. Surgical Endoscopy (2025). High credibility.

Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) impacts 10–30% of the population in the Western world. Surgical interventions, including laparoscopic fundoplication (LF), transoral incisionless fundoplication (TIF), and magnetic sphincter augmentation (MSA), have proven effective in managing GERD. This meta-analysis aims to compare short- and long-term outcomes of these surgical options.

- **Methods**: A comprehensive search of PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Cochrane, and Medline from 1980 to 2024 was conducted to identify randomized control trials or cohort designs that included adults with GERD who underwent fundoplication (Nissen, Toupet), MSA, or TIF. The studies had to report on preoperative and postoperative acid exposure time (AET), DeMeester score, and/or relief score (e.g. GERD-HRQL). We considered all postoperative outcome measurements. Studies with any surgical variations of the procedures, reoperations, and studies not published in English were excluded. Risk of bias was assessed using the Oxford scoring system for randomized control trials and the Newcastle-Ottawa scale (NOS) for cohort designs.

A total of 3912 studies were identified initially, with our review including 78 unique studies providing 166 postoperative outcome measurements. Given that studies could include multiple postoperative outcome measurements, we used multilevel random-effects meta-analysis. Between-procedure comparisons were made using multilevel meta-regression. For all outcomes, more positive values indicated greater improvement; mean differences (MD) were estimated for AET and DeMeester scores, whereas standardized mean…

### Fundoplication versus medical management of gastroesophageal reflux disease: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^113DX9fZ]. Surgical Endoscopy (2014). Low credibility.

Medical, endoscopic, and open/laparoscopic surgical methods are used to treat gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). This study aimed to perform a systematic review of randomized controlled trials comparing medical and surgical treatments of GERD in adult patients.

- **Methods**: For the study, MEDLINE and EMBASE (1980–2012) were searched. Two reviewers independently assessed methodologic aspects and extracted data from eligible studies, focusing on patient-relevant outcomes. The primary outcomes were health-related and GERD-specific quality-of-life aspects. Standardized mean differences (SMDs) between treatment groups were calculated and combined using random-effect meta-analysis.

- **Results**: The study identified 11 publications reporting on 7 trials comparing surgical (open or laparoscopic) and medical treatment of GERD. Meta-analysis of both quality-of-life aspects showed a pooled-effect estimate in favor of fundoplication (SMD 0.18; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.01–0.35; SMD 0.33; 95% CI 0.13–0.54). Heartburn and regurgitation were less frequent after surgical intervention. However, a considerable proportion of patients still needed antireflux medication after fundoplication. Nevertheless, the surgical patients were significantly more satisfied with their symptom control and showed higher satisfaction with the treatment received.

- **Conclusions**: This systematic review showed that surgical management of GERD is more effective than medical management with respect to patient-relevant outcomes in the short and medium term. However, long-term studies still are needed.

### Twenty years of laparoscopic fundoplication for GERD [^116vUDSz]. World Journal of Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

The first laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication was performed 20 years ago. Surgical management of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) should be offered only to appropriately studied and selected patients, with the ultimate aim of improving the well-being of the individual, or the "quality of life". The choice of fundoplication should be dictated by the surgeon's preference and experience.

### The evolution of TIF: Transoral incisionless fundoplication [^1112JwCh]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2020). Low credibility.

Over the same timeline, four different procedures emerged. The initial device was used to perform the endoluminal gastro–gastric fundoplication, called "ELF". This demonstrated the device's ability to safely manipulate and suture gastric to gastric tissue but did not develop a significant clinical application. The second procedure was called TIF 1.0 and was a longitudinally oriented plication of the gastric cardia onto the distal esophagus just proximal to the gastroesophageal junction.

The third procedure, named TIF 2.0, incorporated a rotational wrap of the cardia and fundus around the circumference of the distal esophagus, providing a 2–4 cm length of the wrap over the intra-abdominal distal esophagus. This procedure was identified as morphologically and physiologically most similar to the gold standard Nissen fundoplication. It was during this time that the expanded use of the device brought the treatment of reflux disease into the realm of possibility. Like the research performed by Belsey to identify the five tenets of reflux surgery, the TIF procedure developed over time to address each of these requirements:

- **The fundoplication must bring fundus over the esophagus and secure to the esophagus**.
- **The fundoplication must be constructed without stricture**.
- **The fundoplication is most effective when constructed 2–4 cm in length**.
- **The fundoplication must remain below the diaphragm**.
- **The diaphragmatic crura must be approximated to the esophagus**.

The device improvements and transition from ELF to TIF 1.0 to TIF 2.0 allowed the advancement of these procedures.

### Randomized clinical trial of laparoscopic total (Nissen) versus posterior partial (Toupet) fundoplication for gastro-oesophageal reflux disease based on preoperative oesophageal manometry [^112G6KnF]. The British Journal of Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Laparoscopic fundoplication is an accepted treatment for symptomatic gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. The aim of this study was to clarify whether total (Nissen) or partial (Toupet) fundoplication is preferable, and whether preoperative oesophageal manometry should be used to determine the degree of fundoplication performed.

- **Methods**: Preoperative oesophageal manometry was used to stratify 127 patients with established gastro-oesophageal reflux disease into effective (75) and ineffective (52) oesophageal motility groups. Patients in each group were randomized to Nissen (64) or Toupet (63) fundoplication.

- **Results**: No significant differences between the operative groups were seen in heartburn, regurgitation, or other reflux-related symptoms up to one year after surgery. Dysphagia of any degree (27 versus 9 percent; P = 0.018) and chest pain on eating (22 versus 5 percent; P = 0.018) were more prevalent at one year in the Nissen group. There were no differences in postoperative symptoms between the effective and ineffective motility groups. Surgery failed in eight patients on postoperative pH criteria, three in the Nissen group and five in the Toupet group.

- **Conclusion**: Any differences in the symptomatic outcome of laparoscopic Nissen and Toupet fundoplication appear minimal. There is no reason to tailor the degree of fundoplication to preoperative oesophageal manometry.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for gastroesophageal reflux disease, more specifically with respect to transoral incisionless fundoplication, ACG 2022 guidelines recommend considering transoral incisionless fundoplication in patients with regurgitation as their primary PPI-refractory symptom and in patients with abnormal gastroesophageal reflux documented by objective testing.

### Excellent quality of life after Nissen fundoplication depends on successful elimination of reflux symptoms and not the invasiveness of the surgical approach [^112uR6pJ]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

Quality of life, which is often poor in patients with reflux disease, improves significantly after an antireflux operation. The aim of this study was to determine the relative importance of the operative approach used for a fundoplication, as well as the successful elimination of reflux symptoms on long-term quality of life in patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease.

- **Methods**: A questionnaire, including the medical outcome study short-form health survey (SF-36), was completed by 105 patients who had undergone either a laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication (n = 72) or a transthoracic Nissen fundoplication (n = 33); median follow-up was 25 and 31 months, respectively. Patients were classified as completely or incompletely relieved of reflux symptoms based on the frequency of reflux symptoms and the use of acid-suppression medication.

- **Results**: Patients selected for transthoracic Nissen fundoplication had significantly worse preoperative gastroesophageal reflux disease, based on the presence of a large hiatal hernia, Barrett's esophagus, or stricture. Long-term quality of life was similar for the two approaches but was significantly decreased in patients with reflux symptoms. Compared with laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication patients, transthoracic Nissen fundoplication patients were less likely to use acid-suppression medication and tended to be more satisfied with their operation.

- **Conclusions**: Long-term quality of life was independent of the invasiveness of the procedure but significantly dependent on the successful elimination of reflux symptoms and the necessity for…

### An anterior or posterior approach to partial fundoplication? Long-term results of a randomized trial [^1178WfSQ]. World Journal of Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Partial fundoplications have been popularized due to their lower risk of mechanical side effects. The question emerges whether a similar partial wrap should be done posterior or anterior to the distal esophagus. We conducted a study to compare the long-term outcomes of laparoscopic partial fundoplications constructed as either anterior (AF) or posterior (PF) repairs.

- **Patients and methods**: Ninety-five patients were enrolled in a randomized clinical trial. After a mean follow-up of 65 months, 43 AF and 45 PF patients remained in the study. The levels of reflux control and post-fundoplication complaints were assessed using validated instruments.

- **Results**: A posterior fundoplication provided significantly better control of reflux-related symptoms (heartburn p < 0.0001, acid regurgitation p < 0.0001). This was reflected in a significantly lower number of reoperations and the need for antisecretory drug therapy. The earlier postoperative difference in post-fundoplication symptoms disappeared.

- **Conclusions**: A laparoscopic posterior partial fundoplication offers a high and durable level of disease control with few side effects. The anterior type of repair cannot be recommended due to insufficient reflux control.

### "Floppy" Nissen vs. Toupet laparoscopic fundoplication: Quality of life assessment in a 5-year follow-up (part 2) [^1124c56X]. Endoscopy (2002). Low credibility.

Quality of life as an outcome variable has become an important measure in clinical research. This study is the second part of a prospective assessment of the quality of life outcome, in a 5-year follow-up of patients who underwent laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication or Toupet fundoplication. Data from a 1-year follow-up have been previously published (part I).

Using the Gastrointestinal Quality of Life Index (GIQLI), the quality of life data of 169 consecutive patients who had undergone a laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication (LNF; n = 104) or a laparoscopic Toupet fundoplication (LTF; n = 65), were evaluated 3 years and 5 years postoperatively. Six patients out of the initial study group (n = 175), including three from each group, were excluded from the main analysis because they had undergone laparoscopic re-fundoplication during the 1-year follow-up. Data from patients with repeat surgery have been analysed separately. In addition to administering the GIQLI, we evaluated patient satisfaction with surgery, possible surgical side effects or disease-related symptoms, the use of antireflux medication, and surgical interventions in relation to initial antireflux surgery. For those patients who were willing (n = 111), we also performed esophageal manometry and 24-hour pH monitoring 5 years postoperatively.

At 3 years and 5 years postoperatively, the analysis of quality of life data showed that the GIQLI score remained stable in comparison with the 1-year follow-up data, with mean scores of 121 ± 8.7 points.

### Population-based trend analysis of laparoscopic Nissen and Toupet fundoplications for gastroesophageal reflux disease [^113LP5vm]. Surgical Endoscopy (2010). Low credibility.

The Nissen and Toupet fundoplications are the most commonly used techniques for the surgical treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease. At the time of writing, no population-based trend analysis has been reported examining the choice of procedure and short-term outcomes. This study was designed to analyze trends in the use of Nissen versus Toupet fundoplications and corresponding short-term outcomes during a 10-year period between 1995 and 2004.

- **Methods**: A trend analysis was performed on 873 patients (Toupet: 254 patients, Nissen: 619 patients) prospectively enrolled in the database of the Swiss Association for Laparoscopic and Thoracoscopic Surgery.

- **Results**: The frequency of the performed techniques remained stable during the observation period (p value for trend 0.206). The average postoperative and total length of hospital stay both significantly decreased during the 10-year period from 5.6 to 4.0 days and 6.8 to 4.8 days, respectively (both p values for trend < 0.001). The average duration of surgery decreased significantly from 141 minutes to 121 minutes (p value for trend < 0.001). There was a trend towards fewer complications in later years (2000–2004) compared to early years (1995–1999, p = 0.058). Conversion rates were significantly lower in later years compared with early years (p = 0.004).

- **Conclusions**: This is the first trend analysis in the literature reporting clinical outcomes of 873 prospectively enrolled patients undergoing Nissen and Toupet fundoplications during a 10-year period. The proportion of laparoscopic Nissen versus Toupet fundoplications remained stable.

### Concomitant fundoplication increases morbidity of gastrostomy tube placement [^111koyNG]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Fundoplication is often performed in conjunction with gastrostomy tube (GT) placement in children, but there is a great deal of variation in rates and indications for this procedure. Little is known about the impact of fundoplication on peri-operative outcomes. This study examines a national cohort of pediatric patients to compare risk-adjusted surgical outcomes in patients undergoing GT placement with or without concomitant fundoplication.

- **Methods**: We identified all patients undergoing GT placement in the 2012 National Surgical Quality Improvement Program - Pediatric. We evaluated demographics, comorbidities, complications, and length of stay for GT with fundoplication versus GT alone. We defined composite morbidity as a dichotomous variable for the presence of any complication. Logistic regression was performed to identify predictors of morbidity after adjusting for covariates.

- **Results**: 1289 GT patients were identified, and 148 (11.5%) underwent concomitant fundoplication. The fundoplication patients were more likely to be younger, have cardiac risk factors, and be on respiratory support. They also had higher rates of surgical site infection (7.4% vs. 3.7%, p = 0.03) and composite morbidity (16.9% vs. 8.7%, p = 0.001), and longer length of stay (median 5 vs. 3 days, p < 0.0001) compared to GT only. After adjusting for covariates, fundoplication was a predictor of composite morbidity and increased length of stay.

- **Conclusion**: Concomitant fundoplication is an independent risk factor for 30-day post-operative morbidity in patients undergoing GT placement. These findings do not negate the…

Regarding surgical interventions for bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome, particularly in relation to fundoplication, the ATS/ERS/ISHLT 2014 guidelines recommend considering referrals of lung transplant recipients. Specifically, if there is a decline in FEV1 consistent with the onset of BOS alongside confirmed gastroesophageal reflux, these patients should be referred to an experienced surgeon to evaluate the potential for fundoplication of the GEJ.

### Randomized clinical trial of 270° posterior versus 180° anterior partial laparoscopic fundoplication for gastro-oesophageal reflux disease [^113TCKAJ]. The British Journal of Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Partial fundoplications provide similar reflux control with fewer post-fundoplication symptoms compared with Nissen fundoplication for gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD). The best choice of procedure for partial fundoplication remains unclear. The aim of this study was to compare the outcomes of two different types of partial fundoplication for GORD.

- **Methods**: A double-blind RCT was conducted between 2012 and 2015 in two hospitals specializing in antireflux surgery. Patients were randomized to undergo either a laparoscopic 270° posterior fundoplication (Toupet) or a laparoscopic 180° anterior fundoplication. The primary outcome was postoperative dysphagia at 12 months, measured by the Dakkak score. Subjective outcomes were analyzed at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after surgery. Objective reflux control was assessed before and 6 months after surgery.

- **Results**: Ninety-four patients were randomized to laparoscopic Toupet or laparoscopic 180° anterior fundoplication (47 in each group). At 12 months, 85 patients (90 percent) were available for follow-up. Objective scores were available for 76 (81 percent). The postoperative Dakkak dysphagia score at 12 months was similar in the two groups (mean 5.9 for Toupet versus 6.4 for anterior fundoplication; P = 0.773). Subjective outcomes at 12 months demonstrated no significant differences in the control of reflux or post-fundoplication symptoms. Overall satisfaction and willingness to undergo surgery did not differ between the groups. Postoperative endoscopy and 24-hour pH monitoring showed no significant differences in mean oesophageal function.

### Transoral incisionless fundoplication: Current status [^115sXEEF]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Thus, based on the critical analysis of recent data, ideal candidates for the TIF procedure are chronic GERD patients with partial but inadequate symptom control on high-dose PPI therapy who have only mild to moderate deterioration of the GEJ (absent or small hiatal hernia ≤ 2 cm, Hill grade I or II) and effective esophageal motility.

### Fundoplication significantly improves objective and subjective reflux outcomes-a meta-analysis [^114XayMC]. Surgical Endoscopy (2025). Low credibility.

The methodological quality was assessed in all studies meeting the inclusion criteria by three authors, with disagreements resolved through consensus. Randomized controlled trials were evaluated using the Jadad scale, also known as the Oxford quality scoring system. Studies employing a cohort design were assessed using the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale for Cohort Studies. Traditionally, a Jadad score of three or greater indicates a good-quality study; however, owing to the impossibility of blinding the surgeon or patient in these studies, a score of two or greater was considered indicative of good quality.

Three authors used a standardized data collection form to extract data from each study; disagreements were resolved through consensus. The extracted data included the type of study (manuscript or abstract), country of origin, GERD procedure, study design, total number of patients, mean baseline age, percentage of male participants, mean body mass index (BMI), and severity of esophagitis based on the Los Angeles classification system. Researchers collected data on all post-procedure follow-up periods and the sample size at each follow-up. If a study compared outcomes of two or more GERD procedures, outcome data were extracted separately for each. For all three outcomes, pre- and post-operative mean scores and indices of variability, such as standard deviation, standard error, and confidence intervals, were extracted.

### Does the use of EndoFLIP during fundoplications improve outcomes [^1174isBs]. Surgical Endoscopy (2025). Low credibility.

Materials and methods

Data were collected through a retrospective review of a prospectively maintained database from January 2023 to September 2024. The study took place at a single institution and included patients undergoing robotic or laparoscopic paraesophageal hernia repair with fundoplication. Any type of fundoplication was included and was classified as either a partial posterior wrap or a partial anterior wrap. EndoFLIP measurements were taken after hiatal dissection and again after fundoplication.

Postoperative follow-up involved subjective quality-of-life surveys to calculate Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease-Health Related Quality of Life Questionnaire (GERD-HRQL) and Reflux Symptom Index (RSI) scores. A regurgitation score (REGURG) was determined by summing the scores of six isolated regurgitation questions from the GERD-HRQL survey. Dysphagia and bloating scores, embedded within the GERD-HRQL, were tracked individually. Additionally, patients were queried on their continued use of proton pump inhibitors (PPI) or H2 blockers for symptom control.

Surveys were conducted in the clinic at 2 month, 6 month, and 1 year intervals. Only patients who consistently followed up at all three time intervals were included in the final analysis. Institutional review board approval was secured for this study.

### Laparoscopic dor versus Toupet fundoplication following Heller myotomy for achalasia: results of a multicenter, prospective, randomized-controlled trial [^113Qq6tT]. Surgical Endoscopy (2012). High credibility.

The type of fundoplication that should be performed in conjunction with Heller myotomy for esophageal achalasia is controversial. We prospectively compared anterior fundoplication (Dor) with partial posterior fundoplication (Toupet) in patients undergoing laparoscopic Heller myotomy.

- **Methods**: A multicenter, prospective, randomized-controlled trial was initiated to compare Dor versus Toupet fundoplication after laparoscopic Heller myotomy. Outcome measures were symptomatic GERD scores (0–4, five-point Likert scale questionnaire) and 24-h pH testing at 6–12 months after surgery. Data are mean ± SD. Statistical analysis was by Mann-Whitney U test, Wilcoxon signed rank test, and Friedman's test.

- **Results**: Sixty of 85 originally enrolled and randomized patients who underwent 36 Dor and 24 Toupet fundoplications had follow-up data per protocol for analysis. Dor and Toupet groups were similar in age (46.8 vs. 51.7 years) and gender (52.8 vs. 62.5% male). pH studies at 6–12 months in 43 patients (72%: Dor n = 24 and Toupet n = 19) showed total DeMeester scores and % time pH < 4 were not significant between the two groups. Abnormal acid reflux was present in 10 of 24 Dor group patients (41.7%) and in 4 of 19 Toupet patients (21.0%) (p = 0.152). Dysphagia and regurgitation symptom scores improved significantly in both groups compared to preoperative scores. No significant differences in any esophageal symptoms were noted between the two groups preoperatively or at follow-up. SF-36 quality-of-life measures changed significantly from pre- to postoperative for five of ten domains.

### Analysis of the causes of failed antireflux surgery and the principles of treatment: A review [^112xMC5x]. JAMA Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Although the diagnostic evaluation and technical elements for a successful laparoscopic fundoplication have been clearly identified, 10% to 20% of patients will eventually experience recurrence of their symptoms. The management of patients who fail antireflux surgery is complex and not well codified.

The objective of this review is to provide an evidence- and experience-based analysis of the causes of failed antireflux surgery and to underscore the principles of treatment. A comprehensive search was conducted in PubMed for articles published between 1980 and 2014. The search terms included heartburn, regurgitation, dysphagia, gastroesophageal reflux disease, cough, aspiration, laryngitis, GERD, GORD, endoscopy, manometry, pH monitoring, proton pump inhibitors, and Nissen fundoplication.

Before planning therapy, a careful workup is necessary to determine whether the symptoms are due to recurrent reflux and to understand what caused the recurrence. Therapy needs to be individualized based on the symptoms and on the findings of the workup. In some patients, a nonesophageal cause will be identified. Among patients with recurrent reflux, some will do well with acid-reducing medications, while others will need another operation.

Laparoscopic antireflux surgery is a very effective and long-lasting treatment for gastroesophageal reflux disease. Its success is based on a careful preoperative evaluation and the performance of a fundoplication that respects the key technical elements.

### Patterns of reoperation after failed fundoplication: An analysis of 9462 patients [^113hLXvx]. Surgical Endoscopy (2018). Low credibility.

Little is known about the choice of reoperation after failed fundoplication for gastroesophageal reflux disease. Both redo fundoplication and conversion to a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) procedure are considered safe and effective. This study aimed to characterize the rates of different revisional procedures and to identify risk factors associated with failed fundoplication.

- **Methods**: Using a statewide database, patient records were examined for those who underwent fundoplication between 2000 and 2010. The primary outcomes included the rate of each type of reoperation and the pattern of subsequent procedures. Demographics and comorbidities were evaluated using a multivariable logistic regression model to identify risk factors associated with reoperation after fundoplication.

- **Results**: A total of 9462 patients were included in the analysis. Overall, 430 (4.5%) patients underwent reoperation. Of those, 46 (10.7%) patients underwent RYGB at their first reoperation, while the remainder had a redo fundoplication. An additional five patients were converted to RYGB after undergoing a redo fundoplication, making a total of 51 patients (11.9%) who were converted to RYGB at any point. Among these, 83% of patients converted to RYGB were obese, compared to 8% for those who had a redo fundoplication. A single redo fundoplication was performed in 81% of patients, while 35 patients (8.1%) underwent two or more revisional procedures. On average, any reoperation was performed 2.9 years after fundoplication, with redo fundoplication occurring 2.5 years, and RYGB 6.5 years later. Age 30–49 years (vs. > 70 years; OR 2.01, p = 0.011) and 50–69 years (vs. > 70 years; OR 1.61, p = 0.011) were significant factors.

### Fundoplication significantly improves objective and subjective reflux outcomes-a meta-analysis [^115e2hDM]. Surgical Endoscopy (2025). Low credibility.

A total of 57 unique studies provided 125 total follow-up observations from 7,146 patients. Among them, 2,591 patients (36.3%; 25 studies) underwent Nissen fundoplication, 2,288 patients (32.0%; 13 studies) underwent magnetic sphincter augmentation (MSA), 760 patients (10.6%; 9 studies) underwent a Toupet fundoplication, and 690 patients (9.7%; 13 studies) underwent transoral incisionless fundoplication (TIF). The remaining 11.4% underwent an unspecified laparoscopic fundoplication.

The multilevel meta-analysis model did not estimate, and significant between-study heterogeneity was observed (Tau-squared: 1.13, Higgins-Thompson I²: 97.3%). Overall, undergoing a gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) procedure provided statistically significant relief (mean improvement: 2.26, 95% CI: 1.96 to 2.55, p < 0.001). Although statistically significant improvement was observed for all GERD procedures, Nissen fundoplication averaged worse relief compared to MSA (mean difference: −0.29, 95% CI: −0.56 to −0.01, p = 0.042) and Toupet fundoplication (mean difference: −0.17, 95% CI: −0.32 to −0.01, p = 0.033); no other differences were statistically significant.

- **Meta-regression**: Relief was diminished as the length of follow-up increased. Specifically, for every 12-month post-procedure, the relief score was lower by 0.04 standard deviations (95% CI: −0.08 to −0.01, p = 0.034), an effect primarily driven by Nissen fundoplication (−0.08, 95% CI: −0.12 to −0.02, p = 0.005). Furthermore, studies that included 10% more male patients averaged 0.11 standard deviations greater relief scores (95% CI: 0.02 to 0.20, p = 0.016).

### Strategies for surgical remediation of the multi-fundoplication failure patient [^111xtqMJ]. Surgical Endoscopy (2019). Low credibility.

Outcomes are not well-studied in patients undergoing remediation for multi-fundoplication failure, which refers to two or more prior failed fundoplications. Re-operation must balance reflux control and restoration of the ability to eat with the challenge of reconstructing a distorted hiatus and gastroesophageal (GE) junction. This study aims to present our experience with surgical remediation for multi-fundoplication failure.

- **Methods**: Medical records were retrospectively reviewed for 91 patients who underwent a third or more esophagogastric operation for fundoplication failure at a single institution from 2007 to 2016. Dysphagia was present in 56% of cases and heartburn in 51%. The median number of prior operations was 2, with a range of up to 6. Anatomic failure included: slipped wrap in 26 cases, wrap herniation in 23, hiatal stenosis in 24, hiatal mesh complications in 8, and wrap dehiscence in 10. Operative approaches generally adhered to an institutional algorithm, consisting of hiatal hernia repair with: re-do fundoplication in 55%, takedown of fundoplication alone in 24%, Roux-en-Y gastrojejunostomy in 14%, and GE junction resection in 7%. A laparoscopic approach was successful in 81% of cases.

- **Results**: The mean duration of operations was 217 minutes, and the median length of hospital stay was 3 days. The complication rate was 13%, with 7% undergoing unplanned early re-operation. Patients were followed for a mean of 11 months, and recurrent hiatal hernia was detected in 13%. Late re-operation was performed in 6% of cases for recurrent hiatal hernia. Reflux symptoms resolved in 93% of patients, and dysphagia resolved in 84%.

### Minimal access surgery compared with medical management for chronic gastro-oesophageal reflux disease: UK collaborative randomised trial [^1179nYsv]. BMJ (2008). High credibility.

Laparoscopic fundoplication significantly increased health status for at least 12 months after surgery. Surgery does carry costs, however, and we will report investigation of cost effectiveness elsewhere. The narrowing of differences in health status between three and 12 months could reflect a postoperative placebo effect or could indicate decreasing effectiveness of surgery over time from surgery. This pattern has been observed after open fundoplication. We have therefore instituted annual follow-ups using similar questionnaires and plan to report the long-term effectiveness after five years of follow-up.

### Endoscopic GERD therapy: A primer for the transoral incisionless fundoplication procedure [^113gweD5]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2019). High credibility.

Patients with medically refractory GERD have the option of surgery but may opt for effective minimally invasive interventions when available. However, the primary GERD pharmacologic therapy, proton pump inhibitors, does not satisfactorily address the pathophysiology of the disease. Moreover, a therapeutic gap exists in those severely symptomatic patients who fail medical management and are poor candidates for surgical fundoplication.

Recently, a revival of minimally invasive endoscopic interventions aiming to correct the antireflux barrier has followed existing device modifications, enhancing their safety and efficacy profile. Of these technologies, the transoral incisionless fundoplication (TIF) technique, in its current 2.0 iteration, has been studied in several randomized controlled trials with favorable outcomes and a low rate of adverse events.

In this review, we discuss the landscape of endoscopic GERD therapy, focusing on recent updates in the TIF 2.0 procedure with the EsophyX-Z device (EndoGastric Solutions, Redmond, Wash, USA). We explore the evolution, differences, and improvements in this technique across different generations of the EsophyX device. We also present a framework for candidate selection, based on medical and anatomic considerations. When streamlined within a milieu of comprehensive multidisciplinary programs, these improved endoscopic interventions can provide viable avenues for a carefully selected patient population, bridging therapy gaps, and selectively targeting the primary pathophysiology of the disease.

### Gastroesophageal reflux disease treatment: side effects and complications of fundoplication [^116oad6u]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2013). Low credibility.

Even skilled surgeons may experience complications after antireflux surgery. Fortunately, the mortality rate is low (< 1%) with laparoscopic surgery. Immediate postoperative morbidity is uncommon (5%-20%), and conversion to an open operation occurs in less than 2.5% of cases. Common late postoperative complications include gas-bloat syndrome (up to 85%), dysphagia (10%-50%), diarrhea (18%-33%), and recurrent heartburn (10%-62%). Most of these complications improve within 3–6 months after surgery. Dietary modifications, pharmacologic therapies, and esophageal dilation may be helpful.

Failures after antireflux surgery typically occur within the first 2 years following the initial operation and fall into five patterns: herniation of the fundoplication into the chest, slipped fundoplication, tight fundoplication, paraesophageal hernia, and malposition of the fundoplication. Reoperation rates range from 0%-15% and should be performed by experienced foregut surgeons.

### Influence of wrap length on the effectiveness of Nissen and Toupet fundoplications: 5-year results of prospective, randomized study [^113EsdqQ]. Surgical Endoscopy (2013). Low credibility.

Long-term results in antireflux surgery may depend on fundoplication type and wrap length. In this study, we compared the outcome of two different wrap lengths among patients undergoing partial or total fundoplications, as part of a prospective 5-year follow-up assessment.

- **Methods**: A total of 153 patients were randomized to undergo either Nissen or Toupet 1.5- or 3-cm wrap laparoscopic fundoplication. The primary endpoint, treatment failure rate, was defined as reGERD or persistent dysphagia. The intensity of heartburn, dysphagia, gas-bloating, and the presence of esophagitis were assessed as secondary outcomes at 1-year and 5-year follow-up.

- **Results**: At the 5-year follow-up, data were collected from 129 (85%) patients. At the 1-year follow-up, 17 (11%) treatment failures were detected. By the end of the fifth year, the numbers reached 23 (15%). Failures were more common in the 1.5-cm Toupet group (25%) and the 3-cm Nissen group (18.2%). A significant difference in failure rates was found between the 1.5-cm and 3-cm Toupet groups (P < 0.05). Dysphagia remained low during the follow-up in all groups. After 5 years, higher scores of heartburn were detected in the Nissen 1.5-cm group (20.8%), with the lowest scores observed in the Toupet 3-cm group. Bloating symptoms were more prevalent among patients in both the Nissen and Toupet 3-cm groups at the 5-year follow-up. By the end of the fifth year, the prevalence of esophagitis was lower in the Nissen 1.5-cm (19.3%) and Toupet 3-cm (13.3%) groups, while the highest prevalence of esophagitis, 32.4%, was found in the Toupet 1.5-cm group.

### Clinical and pH-metric outcomes of transoral esophagogastric fundoplication for the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease [^116jVuc6]. Surgical Endoscopy (2011). Low credibility.

Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is one of the most common clinical disorders observed in developed countries. In the US, nearly 20% of the adult population experiences typical GERD symptoms such as heartburn or acid regurgitation at least once a week, with an annual prevalence reaching 60%. Traditional treatment has been medical (mainly proton pump inhibitors, PPIs), with surgery reserved for patients with incomplete symptom control or intolerance to medical therapy.

In recent years, there has been a growing number of reports suggesting that approximately 30% (range = 25–40%) of GERD patients do not obtain symptomatic relief (either partially or completely) on standard-dose PPI therapy. Medical therapy also appears to have limited effectiveness in 30–50% of GERD patients with atypical laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR) symptoms who continue to experience hoarseness, sore or burning throat, chronic cough, or excessive throat-clearing despite normalized esophageal acid exposure on aggressive PPI therapy.

Studies comparing groups of patients with primarily typical or atypical GERD symptoms have found the same degree of distortion and deterioration of the esophagogastric junction, suggesting a similar pathophysiology. This anatomic similarity, together with the refractory nature of symptoms, establishes surgical fundoplication as appropriate therapy in patients with established GERD and laryngeal symptoms.

Antireflux surgery is a well-established surgical procedure in preventing both acid and nonacid reflux and is known to be effective in patients with both typical…

### Fundoplication significantly improves objective and subjective reflux outcomes-a meta-analysis [^112cKRCf]. Surgical endoscopy (2025). Low credibility.

Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) impacts 10–30% of the population in the Western world. Surgical interventions including laparoscopic fundoplication (LF), transoral incisionless fundoplication (TIF), and magnetic sphincter augmentation (MSA) have proven effective in managing GERD. This meta-analysis aims to compare short- and long-term outcomes of these surgical options.

- **Methods**: A comprehensive search of PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Cochrane, and Medline from 1980 to 2024 was conducted to identify randomized control trials or cohort designs that included adults with GERD who underwent fundoplication (Nissen, Toupet), MSA, or TIF. Studies needed to have preoperative and post-operative acid exposure time (AET), DeMeester score, and/or relief score (e.g. GERD-HRQL). All post-operative outcome measurements were considered. We excluded studies with surgical variations of the procedures, reoperations, and studies not published in English. Risk of bias was assessed using the Oxford scoring system for randomized control trials and the Newcastle–Ottawa scale (NOS) for cohort designs. A total of 3912 studies were identified initially, with our review including 78 unique studies providing 166 post-operative outcome measurements. Since studies could include multiple post-operative outcome measurements, we used multilevel random-effects meta-analysis. Between-procedure comparisons were made using multilevel meta-regression. For all outcomes, more positive values indicated greater improvement. Mean differences (MD) were estimated for AET and DeMeester scores.

### Laparoscopic Nissen versus Toupet fundoplication: Objective and subjective results of a prospective randomized trial [^116moGWQ]. Surgical Endoscopy (2012). Low credibility.

Although symptom outcomes following laparoscopic fundoplication have been adequately evaluated in the past, comparative subjective data of laparoscopic Nissen and Toupet fundoplications are scarce. Multichannel intraluminal impedance monitoring (MII) has not been used so far for the comparison of objective data.

- **Methods**: One hundred patients with documented chronic gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) were randomly allocated to either floppy Nissen fundoplication (group I, n = 50) or Toupet fundoplication (group II, n = 50). Gastrointestinal Quality of Life Index (GIQLI), symptom grading, esophageal manometry, and MII data were documented preoperatively and 3 months after surgery. Subjective and objective outcome data were compared to those of healthy individuals.

- **Results**: Symptom intensity was significantly more severe, and GIQLI showed impairment in the examined patient population compared to healthy controls. Both procedures resulted in a significant improvement in GIQLI and GERD symptoms (p < 0.01). Dysphagia improved significantly only in group II, while cough, asthma, and distortion of taste improved significantly in both groups. Hoarseness symptoms showed some degree of improvement in both groups but reached statistical significance only in group I. Postoperatively, bowel symptoms partly increased, and the ability to belch decreased in both groups (p < 0.05). Comparison of postoperative GIQLI and symptom scores showed no significant difference between the two groups, except for the ability to belch, which was more impaired after Nissen fundoplication.

### Recurrence after laparoscopic and open Nissen fundoplication: A comparison of the mechanisms of failure [^1164zQKf]. Surgical Endoscopy (2003). Low credibility.

Laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication for treating gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) in adults has a reported recurrence rate of 2–17%. This study investigates the rates and mechanisms of failure after laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication in children.

- **Methods**: All patients who underwent a laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication for GERD and subsequently required a redo Nissen were reviewed (n = 15). The control group consisted of the most recent 15 patients who developed recurrent GERD after an open Nissen fundoplication.

- **Results**: Between 1994 and 2000, laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication was performed in 179 patients. Fifteen patients (8.7%) underwent revision. The mechanisms of failure included herniation in four patients, wrap dehiscence in four, a too-short wrap in three, a loosened wrap in two, and other reasons in two. The reoperation was performed laparoscopically in five patients (33%). The failure mechanisms differed in the open patients: eight were due to slipped wraps, three to dehiscences, and two to herniations.

- **Conclusion**: The failure rate after laparoscopic Nissen is acceptably low. A redo laparoscopic Nissen can be performed safely following an initial laparoscopic approach.

### Transoral incisionless fundoplication: Current status [^113hCTrs]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

The transoral incisionless fundoplication (TIF) procedure has demonstrated consistently low complication rates across various studies. A systematic review conducted in 2013 found a major complication rate of 3.2%, which is comparable to that of laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication. According to a database from the manufacturer of the EsophyX device, serious adverse events occurred in 0.41% of over 17,000 TIF patients, with no mortalities reported following the procedure. The RESPECT study noted that apart from brief postoperative epigastric pain, complications did not significantly differ between the TIF/placebo and sham/PPI groups.

Authors of the TEMPO trial attributed the absence of any serious adverse events in their study to the experience of the investigators, each having performed more than 20 TIF procedures before study initiation. Although improvements in the device and technique over recent years have made the procedure more operator-friendly, rigorous, standardized training and a strict educational curriculum are crucial for new users to maintain the safety profile of the TIF.

In addition to its strong safety profile, TIF's very low incidence of new dysphagia, gas bloat, and excessive flatulence is one of the procedure's most attractive features. Post-fundoplication syndromes were found to be very rare.

### Fundoplication significantly improves objective and subjective reflux outcomes-a meta-analysis [^116FYiMh]. Surgical Endoscopy (2025). High credibility.

This systematic review and meta-analysis were performed in accordance with the 2020 Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement (PRISMA 2020). The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to evaluate the longitudinal follow-up of objective and subjective symptom relief following surgery for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Our study is unique in that we included all repeated follow-up measurements.

- **Study eligibility**: We considered only randomized controlled trials or cohort designs that included adult patients diagnosed with GERD (or GORD) who underwent laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication (complete or total fundoplication), Toupet fundoplication (partial fundoplication, 270°), magnetic sphincter augmentation (MSA, LINX Reflux Management System), or transoral incisionless fundoplication (TIF 1.0, TIF 2.0) for GERD. Outcomes included pre-to-post-operative changes in acid exposure time (AET; percent of time with pH < 4), DeMeester score, or subjective symptom relief score as measured by the GERD-HRQL, GIQLI, QOLRAD, or VAS. As such, patients served as their own control. We excluded studies in which the patients had comorbid achalasia, reoperation for GERD, underwent a concomitant weight loss procedure, or esophagectomy.

- **Search strategy**: Two authors (YT, DN) systematically searched MEDLINE, Scopus, Cochrane Library, and Embase databases from inception through November 22, 2023. The search strategy was developed with the assistance of a research librarian at our institution.

### Long-term disease-specific quality of life after laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication in patients with borderline GERD [^112Ao4TN]. Surgical Endoscopy (2024). Low credibility.

Long-term follow-up of disease-specific quality of life scores after laparoscopic fundoplication for GERD, as it has been historically diagnosed, has been demonstrated in multiple studies to result in durable improvements lasting from one to twenty years after surgery. A recent study comparing patient-reported quality of life scores after laparoscopic fundoplication for historical criteria versus AET-based criteria for GERD concluded that AET may better define patients who should be offered anti-reflux surgery than DeMeester criteria.

There remains a paucity of data comparing surgical outcomes of laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication (LNF) in patients with borderline GERD to those with GERD, particularly for extended follow-up intervals. As such, patients who have borderline GERD as defined by AET but would meet the criteria for GERD as defined by DeMeester score can be challenging to counsel given these recent guidelines. Long-term patient satisfaction and symptom improvement data is critical for patient counseling and decision-making regarding candidacy for fundoplication. This study seeks to improve understanding of the long-term patient quality of life outcomes after fundoplication in the setting of borderline AET. We hypothesized that patients with borderline GERD, when compared to those with GERD as defined by AET, would experience similar long-term improvements in disease-specific quality of life after laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication.

### Fundoplication significantly improves objective and subjective reflux outcomes-a meta-analysis [^116iFhDg]. Surgical Endoscopy (2025). Low credibility.

A total of 26 unique studies provided 34 total follow-up observations from 2,574 patients. Among these, 924 patients (35.9%; 11 studies) underwent a Nissen fundoplication, 915 patients (35.5%; 4 studies) underwent an MSA, 485 patients (18.8%; 9 studies) underwent a TIF, and 50 patients (1.9%; 1 study) underwent a Toupet fundoplication. The remaining 7.8% underwent an unspecified laparoscopic fundoplication. Significant between-study heterogeneity was observed, with a Tau-squared value of 4.02 and a Higgins–Thompson I² of 93.8%.

Overall, undergoing a GERD procedure provided a statistically significant improvement in acid exposure time (mean improvement: 7.80, 95% CI: 6.12 to 9.48, p < 0.001). Although statistically significant improvement was observed for all GERD procedures, the Nissen fundoplication averaged a greater mean improvement compared to the TIF (mean difference: 4.05, 95% CI: 0.13 to 7.96, p = 0.043); no other differences were statistically significant.

- **Table 2: Meta-analysis results by outcome**. For procedure comparisons, the procedure after the "vs". is the reference group.

- **Table 3: Meta-regression results by outcome**.

Further meta-regression indicated that no study-specific variable, including longer lengths of follow-up, was associated with mean improvement.

### A proposed classification for uniform endoscopic description of surgical fundoplication [^1133fYat]. Surgical Endoscopy (2014). Low credibility.

Objective assessment of postfundoplication anatomy is of utmost importance, especially if reoperative intervention is being planned. There is a lack of uniformity in the description of endoscopic findings in these patients. The purpose of this study was to propose a classification for standardized endoscopic reporting of postfundoplication anatomy.

- **Methods**: After institutional review board approval, preoperative endoscopic findings of patients who underwent reoperative intervention from 1992 to 2011 were reviewed and classified. The classification included four factors: E (distance of GEJ to crus), S (amount of gastric tissue between the GEJ and fundoplication), F (fundoplication configuration), and P (paraesophageal hernia).

- **Results**: The endoscopic findings of 310 patients who underwent reoperative antireflux surgery were classified using the newly proposed classification model. A significant increase in the number of procedures was noted over the years. There was no change in presenting symptoms and patterns of failure over the years. The classification model was easily applicable to previous endoscopy reports and showed good symptom association.

- **Discussion**: An endoscopic anatomical classification is proposed for the description of failed fundoplication. With this classification, we hope to fill the gap in developing a uniform classification of failed fundoplications. Further studies addressing widespread applicability and outcome analysis are needed.

### Redo fundoplication vs. Roux-en-Y gastric bypass conversion for failed anti-reflux surgery: Which is better [^113WuEey]. Surgical Endoscopy (2023). Low credibility.

Different techniques have been proposed for reoperation after failed anti-reflux surgery; however, there is no consensus on which should be preferred. We aim to report and compare the outcomes of different revisional techniques for failed anti-reflux surgery.

- **Methods**: We performed a retrospective analysis of patients who underwent redo fundoplication (RF) or Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) conversion following a failed fundoplication at our institution between 2016 and 2021. The primary outcome was the long-term presence of reflux or dysphagia following revisional surgery. Secondary outcomes included 30-day perioperative complications as well as long-term use of anti-reflux medication and radiographic recurrence of hiatal hernia (HH).

- **Results**: A total of 165 patients (median age 63 years, 73.9% female) were included. RF was performed in 120 cases (73 Toupet and 47 Nissen), RYGB in 38 cases, and 7 patients had fundoplication takedown alone. The RYGB group had a significantly higher BMI and more prior revisional surgeries compared to the other groups. Median operative time and length of stay were longer for RYGB. Twenty patients (12.1%) experienced postoperative complications, with the highest incidence in the RYGB group. Reflux and dysphagia improved significantly for the whole cohort, with the greatest improvement noted with reflux in the RYGB group (89.5% with preoperative reflux vs. 10.5% with postoperative reflux, p < .001). On multivariable regression, we found that prior re-operative surgery was associated with persistent reflux and dysphagia, whereas RYGB conversion was pr

### Training for laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication with a newly designed model: A replacement for animal tissue models [^1129QuoU]. Surgical Endoscopy (2010). Low credibility.

Laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication requires the ability to perform an operation in multiple planes within a three-dimensional environment, relying on two-dimensional visual feedback. The acquisition of these skills, along with the need to become proficient using new instruments, suturing techniques, and technological devices, poses challenges in executing a safe and effective operation.

Studies have shown that laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication is as safe and effective as open fundoplication, cementing its status as the preferred surgical option. However, there are reports of higher risks of complications with the laparoscopic approach, such as esophageal perforation, acute paraesophageal herniation, stenosis of the esophageal hiatus, and pneumothorax. Additionally, a higher reoperation rate was observed during the early stages of the laparoscopic approach, although this decreased with increasing experience.

A learning curve of 20 procedures per surgeon was previously established for laparoscopic fundoplication, though it is acknowledged that individuals may progress at different rates. Various factors may influence the duration of a learning curve and its impact on patient outcomes. Key indicators of the learning curve for laparoscopic surgery include the conversion rate and operative complications. Examining individual experiences reveals that issues are more likely during the first five procedures conducted by individual surgeons, with a complication rate ranging from 24% to 55% at the beginning of the learning curve.

### Antireflux surgery in patients with moderate obesity - Fundoplication or Roux-en-Y gastric bypass [^116ixVhJ]. Obesity Surgery (2025). Low credibility.

Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), characterized by the reflux of stomach contents — including, mostly, acid or bile reflux and less commonly volume reflux — into the esophagus, significantly impairs quality of life and can lead to complications such as aspiration, esophagitis, Barrett's esophagus, and an increased risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma. Obesity exacerbates the pathophysiological mechanisms of GERD by increasing intra-abdominal pressure, making its management in patients with obesity particularly challenging.

Surgical interventions, specifically fundoplication and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), have been recognized as effective treatments for patients with GERD refractory to medical management. Fundoplication, which enhances the barrier to reflux by wrapping the upper stomach around the lower esophagus, has been widely used with satisfactory outcomes. On the other hand, RYGB not only aids in significant and sustained weight loss but also alters gastric anatomy and physiology, potentially providing superior control of GERD symptoms in patients with obesity. By creating a small gastric pouch and disconnecting the bile inflow from the stomach, less stomach acid is produced, bile reflux is prevented, and the intragastric pressure is reduced due to exclusion of the gastric pylorus.

Few studies have focused on the comparison between fundoplication and RYGB in patients with WHO (World Health Organization) class III obesity (BMI ≥ 40 kg/m²), but it has been shown that RYGB leads to less in-hospital morbidity, more weight loss, and better control of GERD symptoms.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for gastroesophageal reflux disease, specifically concerning transoral incisionless fundoplication, the ESGE 2020 guidelines recommend not to perform transoral incisionless fundoplication as an alternative to PPI therapy or antireflux surgery for the treatment of GERD. Consider offering transoral incisionless fundoplication to patients with mild GERD who are not willing to take PPIs or undergo antireflux surgery.

### Measuring outcomes of laparoscopic anti-reflux surgery: Quality of life versus symptom scores [^114r7Xva]. World Journal of Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Outcome following fundoplication for gastroesophageal reflux can be measured using objective tests, symptom scores, and quality of life (QoL) measures. Which is best and how these assessments correlate is uncertain. To determine the utility of assessment measures, we compared a general QoL measure (SF-36) and a disease-specific measure (GERD-hr-QoL) with symptom and satisfaction scores in individuals following fundoplication.

- **Methods**: 329 individuals underwent fundoplication between 2000 and 2015 in two centers in Australia and the Netherlands. Patients were assessed before and 3, 12, and 24 months after surgery using 10-point Likert scales to assess heartburn and satisfaction, the SF-36 questionnaire, and the GERD-hr-QoL questionnaire. SF-36 scores were converted into component scores: Physical Component Scale (PCS) score and Mental Component Scale (MCS) score. Correlations between QoL measures and clinical outcomes were determined.

- **Results**: Surgery relieved heartburn (7.0 vs. 0.0 median, P < 0.001) and patients were highly satisfied with the outcome (median 9.0). PCS and MCS scores improved after surgery (PCS 40.9 vs. 46.0, P < 0.001; MCS 47.6 vs. 50.3, P = 0.027). GERD-hr-QoL scores also improved after surgery (15.7 vs. 3.7, P < 0.001). Correlations between PCS and MCS scores versus heartburn and satisfaction scores were generally weak or absent. However, correlations between GERD-hr-QoL versus heartburn and satisfaction scores were moderate to strong.

- **Conclusion**: Despite improvements in scores, the SF-36 correlated poorly with clinical outcome measures, indicating a lack of strong predictive value for postoperative symptom relief in this context.

### Fundoplication significantly improves objective and subjective reflux outcomes-a meta-analysis [^116Lx6o7]. Surgical Endoscopy (2025). High credibility.

Anti-reflux surgery remains one of the primary treatment options for GERD and has evolved significantly over the past two decades. Fundoplication procedures such as Nissen and Toupet continue to be the mainstay of anti-reflux surgical management. However, with technological advancement, options including magnetic sphincter augmentation (MSA) and transoral incisionless fundoplication (TIF) have been increasingly performed. While the outcomes of each procedure have been individually evaluated, direct comparisons among all three options have been challenging and not well reported.

This meta-analysis addressed this gap by evaluating the available literature to provide valuable insights. Our findings demonstrated that all surgical anti-reflux procedures — laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication (LNF), Toupet, TIF, and MSA — significantly improved DeMeester scores, acid exposure time (AET), and subjective symptom relief scores. The subjective and objective improvements are durable and persisted over long-term follow-up. Our results were similar to previously published long-term outcomes after anti-reflux surgery. Although there have been questions raised regarding the long-term durability of anti-reflux surgery, our results reinforce the role of anti-reflux surgery with both objective and subjective improvements.

### Laparoendoscopic single site (LESS) vs. conventional laparoscopic fundoplication for GERD: Is there a difference [^113Nqtq2]. Surgical Endoscopy (2013). Low credibility.

This report details our experience with laparoendoscopic single site (LESS) fundoplication for GERD and provides a comparison to earlier contiguous patients undergoing conventional laparoscopic fundoplication.

- **Methods**: With institutional review board approval, symptoms before and after LESS fundoplications and conventional laparoscopic fundoplications were scored by patients. Outcomes after 130 consecutive LESS fundoplications were compared to 130 contiguous consecutive outcomes after conventional laparoscopic fundoplications.

- **Results**: Patients undergoing conventional laparoscopic vs. LESS fundoplication were very similar. There were no conversions to "open" operations and no notable complications with LESS fundoplication. Symptom reduction was broad and dramatic for patients undergoing LESS or conventional laparoscopic fundoplication; 96% of patients who underwent LESS fundoplication scored their incision as ≥ 8 (1 = revolting to 10 = beautiful).

- **Conclusions**: Relative to conventional laparoscopy, LESS surgery provides excellent resolution of symptoms without an apparent scar. In comparison to conventional laparoscopy, LESS fundoplication is as safe with similar symptom improvement and superior cosmesis.

### Open vs laparoscopic partial posterior fundoplication. A prospective randomized trial [^116fuJ6u]. Surgical Endoscopy (2007). Low credibility.

This study compares outcomes following open and laparoscopic partial posterior fundoplication for gastroesophageal reflux disease concerning perioperative course, postoperative complications, symptomatic relief, reDisease, and the need for reinterventional surgery.

- **Methods**: A prospective randomized trial was performed. Pre- and postoperative testing included endoscopy, esophageal function testing, patient questionnaire, and clinical assessment. Patients were followed for three years.

- **Materials**: Ninety-three patients were randomized to open and 99 to laparoscopic surgery.

- **Results**: Complication rates were higher, and length of stay (LOS) [5 (3–36) vs 3 (1–12) days] and time off work [42 (12–76) vs 28 (0–108) days] was longer in the open group (p < 0.01). Early side effects and recurrences were more common (p < 0.05) in the laparoscopic group. One patient in the open group and eight patients in the laparoscopic group required surgery for reDisease, and seven patients required surgery for incisional hernias after open surgery. Overall, at one and three years, there were no differences in patient-assessed satisfactory outcomes (93.5/93.5 vs 88.8/90.8%) or reflux control (p = 0.53) between the open and laparoscopic groups.

- **Conclusions**: The finding of fewer general complications, shorter length of stay and recovery, similar need for reoperations, and comparable three-year outcomes makes the laparoscopic approach the primary choice when considering surgical options for the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).

### Long-term efficacy of laparoscopic Nissen versus Toupet fundoplication for the management of types III and IV hiatal hernias [^111oSYDE]. Surgical Endoscopy (2019). Low credibility.

Laparoscopic hiatal hernia repair via Toupet or Nissen fundoplication remains the most commonly performed procedure for the management of large hiatal hernias. Few studies have compared the procedures' long-term effectiveness. This study sought to characterize the efficacy of laparoscopic Toupet versus Nissen fundoplication for types III and IV hiatal hernias.

- **Methods**: With IRB approval, a review of all laparoscopic hiatal hernia repairs with mesh reinforcement performed over 7 years at a single center by one surgeon was conducted. Hiatal hernias were classified as type III or IV using operative reports and preoperative imaging. Patients with type I, II, or re-hiatal hernia and patients receiving concomitant procedures were excluded. The GERD-Health Related Quality of Life Survey was administered by telephone no earlier than 18 months postoperatively.

- **Results**: A total of 473 patients underwent laparoscopic fundoplication; 179 having type III or IV hiatal hernia met inclusion criteria. Sixty-two underwent Toupet and 117 underwent Nissen fundoplication. The average patient age was 64 years, with 63% of patients being female. Cohorts were similar in demographics, comorbidities, and intraoperative factors. The survey was completed by 77 patients (43%): 50 having Nissen and 27 Toupet. The median time of survey completion after surgery was 54 months (Nissen) and 25 months (Toupet). Median survey responses across all items for both groups were 0 (no symptoms) with no significant variation between groups. Of patients that had Nissen, 26% reported proton-pump inhibitor use versus 31% of those with Toupet.
