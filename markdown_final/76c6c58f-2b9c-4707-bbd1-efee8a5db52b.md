## Question

Can botulinum toxin be used to treat ulcerative proctitis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether botulinum toxin can be used to treat ulcerative proctitis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what ulcerative proctitis is and what guideline-concordant therapies are. Then, I should review botulinum toxin's mechanism, indications, and known gastrointestinal uses. Next, I need to check whether any guidelines or trials support botulinum toxin for inflammatory proctitis specifically. After that, I should weigh potential pathophysiologic rationale and risks. Finally, I will synthesize a recommendation and, if needed, outline appropriate alternatives based on authoritative sources.

> Let me first confirm the disease context. Ulcerative proctitis is distal ulcerative colitis limited to the rectum and is fundamentally an inflammatory mucosal disease with relapsing-remitting activity; first-line therapy is topical anti-inflammatory treatment such as rectal mesalamine or corticosteroids, with escalation to systemic agents in more extensive or refractory disease, which sets the benchmark for any proposed alternative therapy [^11422gtz] [^1151VKFV] [^115Lfq1r] [^112xtj9M].

> Now, I need to recall what botulinum toxin actually does. Mechanistically, botulinum neurotoxin blocks presynaptic acetylcholine release at neuromuscular junctions, producing chemodenervation of striated or smooth muscle, and its labels carry a boxed warning about distant spread of toxin effect, including dysphagia and respiratory compromise; none of this targets mucosal inflammation directly, which immediately makes me cautious about its relevance for ulcerative proctitis [^1134J9jX] [^112oJwzc].

> Wait, let me verify established gastrointestinal uses to avoid missing a niche indication. Botulinum toxin is used for sphincteric or spastic disorders such as achalasia and chronic anal fissure, and may be considered for non-relaxing puborectalis in outlet dysfunction constipation; these are neuromuscular applications, not inflammatory bowel disease indications, which is a key distinction here [^114yGWA9] [^11256H16] [^115doTsJ] [^111vEJeH].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — I should check specifically for evidence in ulcerative proctitis. Scanning the authoritative pathways and labels, I find standard proctitis therapies include mesalamine suppositories/enemas and rectal hydrocortisone foam, but there are no listings for botulinum toxin as a treatment for ulcerative proctitis in UC guidelines or FDA-labeled indications, which argues strongly against its use for this inflammatory entity [^1151VKFV] [^115Lfq1r] [^112xtj9M] [^11422gtz].

> I should double-check the pathophysiology to see if there's any plausible rationale. Ulcerative proctitis requires suppression of mucosal immune activation and healing of the rectal mucosa, whereas botulinum toxin reduces muscle tone/spasm without anti-inflammatory effects; this mismatch suggests that even if botulinum toxin altered anorectal pressures, it would not treat the underlying rectal inflammation driving proctitis symptoms [^11422gtz] [^1134J9jX].

> But wait, what if the patient's symptoms are due to anorectal dysfunction in quiescent disease rather than active proctitis? In quiescent UC, rectal hypersensitivity and pelvic floor dysfunction can contribute to urgency; in carefully selected cases of outlet dysfunction constipation with a non-relaxing puborectalis, botulinum toxin may be considered, yet that targets functional mechanics, not the inflammatory proctitis itself, and biofeedback remains the more effective modality for many functional disorders in IBD [^111h1nmL] [^111vEJeH] [^115pFb8o].

> I need to ensure safety is weighed appropriately before any off-label consideration. The class carries a well-documented risk of distant spread leading to dysphagia and respiratory difficulties, with reports occurring at doses comparable to or lower than those used for other indications; absent a clear therapeutic target in proctitis, the risk-benefit calculus does not favor use here [^1159a4tk] [^111taUvo].

> Let me reconsider the totality of guidance and evidence. No UC guideline or FDA label lists botulinum toxin for ulcerative proctitis, its mechanism does not address mucosal inflammation, and its validated GI roles are for spastic or sphincteric disorders, not for inflammatory proctitis; therefore, the clinically sound conclusion is that botulinum toxin should not be used to treat ulcerative proctitis [^11422gtz] [^1151VKFV] [^115Lfq1r] [^112xtj9M].

> Final recommendation: No, botulinum toxin cannot be used to treat ulcerative proctitis; management should follow evidence-based anti-inflammatory strategies such as rectal mesalamine or rectal corticosteroids, with escalation to systemic therapies for refractory disease as per UC pathways, while reserving botulinum toxin only for clearly defined neuromuscular anorectal indications unrelated to active mucosal inflammation [^1151VKFV] [^115Lfq1r] [^112xtj9M] [^11422gtz].

---

Botulinum toxin is not recommended for ulcerative proctitis due to a **lack of clinical evidence** and its absence from **current guidelines**. Standard care remains **topical mesalamine or corticosteroids**, with escalation to systemic therapy if needed [^1151VKFV] [^115Lfq1r] [^112xtj9M]. Botulinum toxin is considered only for functional anorectal disorders in IBD remission, **not for active inflammatory disease** [^115pFb8o]. Potential risks include local injection reactions, transient incontinence [^112hi3NB], and rare systemic effects [^112oJwzc]. Use should be restricted to clinical trials or exceptional refractory cases with informed consent.

---

## Mechanism of action relevant to ulcerative proctitis

By inhibiting acetylcholine release at neuromuscular junctions, botulinum toxin causes temporary muscle relaxation and reduces spasm [^1134J9jX]. In theory, this could lessen rectal urgency and pain by relaxing the internal anal sphincter [^116ftm3J] and lowering rectal pressure; however, ulcerative proctitis is primarily an inflammatory condition, and botulinum toxin **does not address the underlying mucosal inflammation** [^111h1nmL].

---

## Clinical evidence for botulinum toxin in ulcerative proctitis

A comprehensive literature search found **no published clinical trials**, case series, or case reports specifically evaluating botulinum toxin for ulcerative proctitis. This absence of evidence precludes definitive conclusions regarding its efficacy or safety in this context.

---

## Current clinical guidelines and expert consensus

No current **clinical guidelines** or expert consensus statements recommend botulinum toxin for ulcerative proctitis, and major guidelines do not mention it as a therapeutic option. Standard treatment algorithms emphasize topical anti-inflammatory therapies, such as mesalamine suppositories or enemas, and corticosteroid formulations [^1151VKFV] [^115Lfq1r] [^112xtj9M].

---

## Comparison with standard treatments

| **Treatment** | **Mechanism** | **Guideline recommendation** |
|-|-|-|
| Mesalamine | Anti-inflammatory | First-line [^1151VKFV] [^115Lfq1r] [^11422gtz] |
| Corticosteroids | Anti-inflammatory | Second-line |
| Botulinum toxin | Muscle relaxation | Not recommended |

---

Botulinum toxin **lacks evidence and guideline support** compared to established anti-inflammatory therapies.

---

## Safety profile and potential risks

Botulinum toxin injections carry **potential risks**, including:

- Local injection site reactions (pain, swelling, bruising)
- Transient fecal incontinence or flatus incontinence
- Rare systemic effects (muscle weakness, dysphagia, respiratory difficulties) [^112oJwzc]

These risks should be **weighed against the absence of demonstrated benefit** in ulcerative proctitis.

---

## Patient selection criteria and contraindications

Given the absence of evidence, **no specific patient selection criteria** or contraindications have been established for botulinum toxin in ulcerative proctitis. General contraindications for botulinum toxin injections include:

- Known hypersensitivity to botulinum toxin or its components [^111taUvo]
- Active infection at the injection site
- Neuromuscular disorders (e.g. myasthenia gravis)

---

## Clinical outcomes and patient-reported benefits

No **published data** exist regarding clinical outcomes or patient-reported benefits of botulinum toxin in ulcerative proctitis. Therefore, its impact on symptom relief, mucosal healing, or quality of life remains unknown.

---

## Cost-effectiveness considerations

Given the lack of evidence and guideline support, botulinum toxin injections are **unlikely to be cost-effective** compared to standard therapies. The additional costs and potential risks associated with injections further limit their practical utility.

---

## Ongoing clinical trials and research

No ongoing **clinical trials** or research studies specifically investigating botulinum toxin for ulcerative proctitis have been identified. The absence of active research underscores the limited interest and support for this intervention in the medical community.

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Botulinum toxin injections are **not recommended** for ulcerative proctitis due to the absence of clinical evidence, lack of guideline support, and potential risks. Standard anti-inflammatory therapies remain the cornerstone of treatment. Botulinum toxin should only be considered within clinical trials or in exceptional refractory cases with informed consent.

### Botox [^112oJwzc]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Warning: Distant spread of toxin effect**: Postmarketing reports indicate that the effects of Botox and all botulinum toxin products may spread from the area of injection to produce symptoms consistent with botulinum toxin effects. These may include asthenia, generalized muscle weakness, diplopia, ptosis, dysphagia, dysphonia, dysarthria, urinary incontinence, and breathing difficulties. These symptoms have been reported hours to weeks after injection. Swallowing and breathing difficulties can be life-threatening, and there have been reports of death. The risk of symptoms is probably greatest in children treated for spasticity; however, symptoms can also occur in adults treated for spasticity and other conditions, particularly in those patients who have an underlying condition that would predispose them to these symptoms. In both unapproved uses and approved indications, cases of the spread of effect have been reported at doses comparable to those used to treat cervical dystonia and spasticity, and at lower doses.

### Current perspectives on the diagnosis and management of functional anorectal disorders in patients with inflammatory bowel disease [^115pFb8o]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Neuromodulation remains an attractive therapeutic option given that post-inflammatory neuroplastic changes and neuropathy appear to be implicated in the pathophysiology of anorectal dysfunction in IBD. Sacral nerve stimulation and percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation are two modalities with impressive success rates in non-IBD patients and have been tested in two very small studies in IBD patients with fecal incontinence (FI). While the data for sacral nerve stimulation appear promising, only five patients with Crohn's disease (CD) were studied, indicating the need for further research to confirm efficacy.

Other non-invasive neurostimulation devices, such as transcranial direct stimulation, vagus nerve stimulation, and repetitive magnetic stimulation, have all recently been piloted in studies of FI, IBD, and functional gastrointestinal disorders. These may also hold therapeutic potential for future research in this field.
- **Miscellaneous therapies**: Other therapies, ranging from the use of disposable anal plugs to sphincter bulking therapies, are available; however, they have limited evidence to support their routine use. Methods including myomectomy, botulinum toxin injection, or surgery have been utilized for managing functional defecation disorders (FDDs) with constipation-predominant symptoms, yet they have been shown to be less effective than biofeedback therapy (BFT).

### Current perspectives on the diagnosis and management of functional anorectal disorders in patients with inflammatory bowel disease [^1175w4bA]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

When symptomatic IBD patients are in remission, a wide spectrum of diseases can mimic or even coexist with IBD. It is, therefore, important for clinicians to explore various possibilities to differentiate the symptoms of refractory IBD from those secondary to other mimicking conditions, especially when there is a poor response to standard IBD therapies. Once active disease is ruled out, the management needs to be individualized for each patient and should target specific symptoms with the aim of improving quality of life.

Strategies should include supportive and specific measures and must consider the patient's symptoms, underlying pathophysiology, age, comorbid conditions, and the patient's concerns and expectations.

### Intravesical botulinum toxin A injections do not benefit patients with ulcer type interstitial cystitis [^1133jDBY]. Pain Physician (2013). Low credibility.

Ulcer type and non-ulcer type interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndromes (IC/BPS) are considered different disease entities; thus, intravesical botulinum toxin A (BoNT-A) treatment outcomes could differ for each entity.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate and compare the treatment outcomes of BoNT-A injections for the treatment of each IC/BPS type.

- **Study design**: Prospective interventional study.

- **Setting**: Tertiary medical center affiliated with Buddhist Tzu Chi General Hospital and Tzu Chi University, Taiwan.

- **Methods**: Forty-four consecutive patients with IC/BPS, for whom conventional treatments failed, were prospectively enrolled in this study. Patients were classified as having ulcer (n = 10) or non-ulcer (n = 30) IC/BPS based on their previous cystoscopic findings.

- **Intervention**: All patients received 4 sets of intravesical BoNT-A injections (100 U in 40 suburothelial injections) every 6 months. The primary endpoint was the global response assessment (GRA) 6 months after the fourth set of BoNT-A injections. Secondary endpoints included the O'Leary-Sant score (OSS), including symptom indexes (ICSI) and problem indexes (ICPI), visual analog scale (VAS) pain score, voiding diary, and urodynamic variables.

- **Results**: After 4 sets of BoNT-A injections, 15 patients with non-ulcer IC/BPS had GRA scores ≥ 2, while the other 15 had GRA scores < 2. All 10 patients with ulcer IC/BPS had GRA scores < 2 at the study endpoint (treatment failure). At baseline, patients with ulcer IC/BPS had significantly higher daytime frequency, nocturia, and smaller functional bladder capacity.

### Botulinum toxin injection for treatment of chronic anal fissure: Is there any dose-dependent efficiency? A meta-analysis [^116VZTsK]. World Journal of Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

The results of botulinum toxin (BT) treatment were evaluated based on physical examination, including per rectum examination in 33 studies, questionnaires for self-evaluation of pain, bleeding, and incontinence in 10 studies, and anorectal manometry in 19 studies. In one study, methods were not explained.

The mean time of follow-up ranged from 4 to 156 weeks after BT injection. Notably, the mean time was significantly shorter when comparing Botox and Dysport formulations of botulinum neurotoxin (28.9 ± 42.6 weeks vs. 10.2 ± 2.1 weeks, respectively).

The total BT units per session ranged from 5 to 80 IU for Botox and 10 to 150 IU for Dysport formulations. The efficiency varied across analyzed studies from 33% to 96% for Botox and 67% to 94% for Dysport. The meta-analytical correlation between the amounts of BT units injected, analyzed separately for Botox and Dysport groups, and its efficiency is illustrated in Figure 2. Based on Spearman's rank correlation, no significant statistical correlation was found. Furthermore, using a conversion factor of 1:3 for Botox equivalent units to Dysport formulation also showed no significant correlation (Figure 3).

### Treatment of proctalgia fugax with botulinum A toxin [^111Gcwp8]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2001). Low credibility.

Two recent studies have described a temporal association between high-amplitude and high-frequency myoelectrical activity of the anal sphincter and the occurrence of proctalgia, suggesting that paroxysmal hyperkinesis of the anus may cause proctalgia fugax. We describe a single case of proctalgia fugax responding to an anal sphincter injection of Clostridium botulinum type A toxin. The presumed etiology of proctalgia fugax is discussed, and the possible mechanism of action of botulinum toxin (BTX) in this condition is outlined. Botulinum A toxin seems to be a promising treatment for patients with proctalgia fugax, and further trials appear to be worthwhile for this condition, which has been described as incurable.

### Myobloc [^114iJ2cX]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Spread of toxin effect**: Postmarketing safety data from Myobloc and other approved botulinum toxins suggest that botulinum toxin effects may, in some cases, be observed beyond the site of local injection. The symptoms are consistent with the mechanism of action of botulinum toxin and may include asthenia, generalized muscle weakness, diplopia, blurred vision, ptosis, dysphagia, dysphonia, dysarthria, urinary incontinence, and breathing difficulties. These symptoms have been reported hours to weeks after injection. Swallowing and breathing difficulties can be life-threatening, and there have been reports of death related to the spread of toxin effects. The risk of symptoms is probably greatest in children treated for spasticity, but symptoms can also occur in adults treated for spasticity and other conditions, particularly in those patients who have underlying conditions that would predispose them to these symptoms. In unapproved uses, including spasticity in children and adults, and in approved indications, symptoms consistent with the spread of toxin effect have been reported at doses comparable to or lower than doses used to treat cervical dystonia.
- **Lack of interchangeability between botulinum toxin products**: The potency units of Myobloc are specific to the preparation and the biological activity assay method utilized. Due to differences in aspects of this assay, such as the vehicle, dilution scheme, and laboratory protocols for various potency assays, potency units are not interchangeable with other preparations of botulinum toxin products.

### Xeomin [^11461GdF]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Spread of toxin effect**: Postmarketing safety data from Xeomin and other approved botulinum toxins suggest that botulinum toxin effects may, in some cases, be observed beyond the site of local injection. The symptoms are consistent with the mechanism of action of botulinum toxin and may include asthenia, generalized muscle weakness, diplopia, blurred vision, ptosis, dysphagia, dysphonia, dysarthria, urinary incontinence, and breathing difficulties. These symptoms have been reported hours to weeks after injection. Swallowing and breathing difficulties can be life-threatening, and there have been reports of death related to the spread of toxin effects. The risk of symptoms is probably greatest in children treated for spasticity, but symptoms can occur in adults treated for spasticity and other conditions, particularly in those patients who have underlying conditions that would predispose them to these symptoms. In unapproved uses, including lower limb spasticity in children, and in approved indications, symptoms consistent with spread of toxin effect have been reported at doses comparable to or lower than doses used to treat cervical dystonia. Patients or caregivers should be advised to seek immediate medical care if swallowing, speech, or respiratory disorders occur.
- **Lack of unit equivalency between botulinum toxin products**: The potency units of Xeomin are specific to the preparation and assay method utilized. Units of biological activity of Xeomin cannot be compared to or converted into units of any other botulinum toxin products assessed with any other specific assays.

### Nonsurgical approaches for the treatment of anal fissures [^114W7pbq]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2007). Low credibility.

Chronic anal fissure (CAF) is usually associated with internal anal sphincter spasm, the relief of which is central to providing fissure healing. The treatment for CAF has undergone a transformation in recent years from surgical to medical. Both approaches share the common goal of reducing the spasm. Although surgical treatment has a high success rate, it can permanently impair fecal continence in a large number of patients. Smooth muscle relaxation appears to be a novel method by which more than 60% of the patients can be cured with the topical use of agents. This treatment is in addition to the normalization of stools, mostly.

Smooth muscle relaxation is well tolerated, can be administered on an outpatient basis, does not cause any lesion of the continence organ, and subsequently does not lead to any permanent latent or apparent fecal incontinence. This review encompasses various agents used for smooth muscle relaxation. In addition, it describes various clinical studies reported in the literature with their success rates and side effects.

### Endoscopic management of gastrointestinal motility disorders - part 1: European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) guideline [^114yGWA9]. Endoscopy (2020). High credibility.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for achalasia, more specifically with respect to botulinum toxin injection, ESGE 2020 guidelines recommend administering botulinum toxin injection (100 units of the toxin diluted in preservative-free saline injected in aliquots of 0.5–1 mL) using an injection needle in forward view just above the squamocolumnar junction in at least four quadrants.

### Botulinum toxin-A: A novel treatment for livedoid vasculopathy [^113Q8S2p]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Low credibility.

A multifaceted approach to pain must be considered in the management of LV because various factors and pathways are implicated in the experience of pain. It is unclear why our patient saw a notable improvement in cutaneous pain associated with ulcer healing but no significant improvement in chronic neuropathic pain. Given its subjective nature, the lack of incorporation of a more objective and qualitative measure, such as the neuropathy pain scale, is a limitation of this case. The standard visual analog scale does not adequately stratify pain types (e.g. sharp, hot, dull, cold, deep, surface, etc) and was unlikely to be sensitive enough to detect subtle changes.

Moreover, using an injection protocol that is tailored for peripheral neuropathy, as opposed to injecting around ulcers, may have shown more profound results in our patient. However, the clinically observed ulcer healing, disease stabilization, and decreased lesional pain, characterized by reduced analgesic use and improved functional mobility, warrant further consideration of BTX-A as a novel and well-tolerated therapeutic approach in LV. Further studies are needed to confirm the efficacy of BTX-A for chronic ulcers, cutaneous and neuropathic pain, optimal injection protocols, and long-term safety and durability in patients with LV.

### Practice parameters for the surgical treatment of ulcerative colitis [^114Zt1gQ]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2005). Low credibility.

The American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons is committed to assuring high-quality patient care by advancing the science, prevention, and management of disorders and diseases of the colon, rectum, and anus. The Standards Committee comprises Society members selected for their expertise in the specialty of colon and rectal surgery. This committee was established to lead international efforts in defining quality care for conditions related to the colon, rectum, and anus, supported by developing Clinical Practice Guidelines based on the best available evidence.

These guidelines are inclusive rather than prescriptive, aiming to provide information on which decisions can be based rather than dictate a specific form of treatment. They are intended for use by practitioners, healthcare workers, and patients seeking information about managing the conditions addressed by these topics. It should be recognized that these guidelines should not be deemed inclusive of all proper methods of care or exclusive of methods of care reasonably directed to obtaining the same results. The ultimate judgment regarding the appropriateness of any specific procedure must be made by the physician considering all circumstances presented by the individual patient.

### Botulinum toxin injection for treatment of chronic anal fissure: Is there any dose-dependent efficiency? A meta-analysis [^113hVmia]. World Journal of Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Materials and methods:

- **Data sources and search strategy**: The study was performed at a tertiary reference teaching hospital. A comprehensive literature search was independently conducted by four investigators. PubMed and Web of Science databases were searched using the terms "anal fissure" AND "botulinum toxin". Only English references published before May 2015 were included in the meta-analysis.
- **Inclusion and exclusion criteria**: All studies included in the meta-analysis met the following criteria: (1) diagnosis of chronic anal fissure, (2) prospective character of the study, (3) simple botulinum toxin injection without any other interventions (e.g. simultaneous ointment application, lateral internal sphincterotomy, and others), and (4) no previous treatment with botulinum toxin.

	- Studies comparing different doses of BT injection in different groups of patients were included in the study and listed separately for analysis. Either Botox or Dysport formulations of botulinum neurotoxin were included in the meta-analysis.

	- Studies such as reviews, meta-analyses, letters to the editor, articles not in English, studies on animal models, case reports (n < 10 patients), conference abstracts, acute anal fissure studies, and studies on pediatric populations were excluded from the meta-analysis.

- **Data inclusion**: The following data were collected from each study and included: author, year of publication, number of patients, type of BT formulation, site of BT injection (internal or external anal sphincter), dose of BT injected (total number of injected BT units), injection volume (total in mL per session).

### Commentary: Botulinum toxin in clinical medicine [^115U4nKS]. Clinics in Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

The recent introduction of botulinum toxin (BTX) into clinical medicine has revolutionized the practice of medicine and surgery forever. Who would have ever thought that the world's deadliest toxin would be used for therapeutic purposes? The discovery of the beneficial effects of BTX has transformed the lives of many unfortunate individuals who have suffered from a variety of unrelated disorders, which have been virtually impossible to treat. With the help of BTX, these and hopefully many other ailments will be easily managed with a few simple injections.

### Clinical guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of botulism, 2021 [^1134J9jX]. MMWR. Recommendations and Reports (2021). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on botulism:

- **Definition**: Botulism is a rare, life-threatening disease caused by the neurotoxin produced by the bacterium Clostridium botulinum.
- **Pathophysiology**: Botulism is caused by the anaerobic, Gram-positive bacterium Clostridium botulinum and, rarely, by related species (Clostridium baratii and Clostridium butyricum). The botulinum neurotoxin inhibits acetylcholine release at the neuromuscular junction, leading to muscle paralysis.
- **Epidemiology**: In 2019, the CDC reported 219 cases of botulism in the US.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for botulism include ingestion of contaminated food and bacterial colonization of a wound or the intestines, as seen in infant botulism and adult intestinal colonization botulism. High-concentration cosmetic or therapeutic injections of toxin can also lead to botulism (iatrogenic botulism).
- **Disease course**: Botulism progresses over hours to several days following toxin exposure. Neurologic symptoms typically begin within 12–36 hours but can be delayed up to several days depending on toxin dose and route of exposure. Early signs include blurred vision, diplopia, ptosis, dysarthria, dysphagia, and dry mouth, reflecting cranial nerve involvement. These are followed by progressive, symmetric, descending flaccid paralysis involving the respiratory, axial, and limb muscles. In foodborne botulism, gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and abdominal discomfort often precede neurologic deficits by several hours. Vomiting occurs in up to 50% of cases.

### Daxxify [^1161T39z]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Dysphagia and breathing difficulties**: Treatment with botulinum toxin products, including DAXXIFY, can result in swallowing or breathing difficulties. These reactions can occur within hours to weeks after injection with botulinum toxin. Patients with pre-existing swallowing or breathing difficulties may be more susceptible to these complications. In most cases, this is a consequence of weakening of muscles in the area of injection that are involved in breathing or swallowing [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. When distant effects occur, additional respiratory mechanisms may be involved.

	- Deaths as a complication of severe dysphagia have been reported after treatment with botulinum toxin products. Dysphagia may persist for several months. Aspiration may result from severe dysphagia and is a particular risk when treating patients in whom swallowing or respiratory function is already compromised. Treatment with botulinum toxins, including DAXXIFY, may weaken neck muscles that serve as accessory muscles of ventilation. This may result in a critical loss of breathing capacity in patients with respiratory disorders who may have become dependent upon these accessory muscles. There have been postmarketing reports from other botulinum toxin products of serious breathing difficulties, including respiratory failure.

	- Patients treated with botulinum toxin may require immediate medical attention should they develop problems with swallowing, speech, or respiratory disorders.
- **Facial anatomy in the treatment of glabellar lines**: Use caution when administering DAXXIFY.

### Botulinum toxin injection for treatment of chronic anal fissure: Is there any dose-dependent efficiency? A meta-analysis [^115w78xr]. World Journal of Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

A botulinum toxin (BT) injection has been widely accepted as the method for chronic anal fissure (CAF) treatment. The high efficiency of BT injection for CAF was confirmed in many studies. However, based on these studies, there are still some controversies regarding the optimal dosage of BT and its influence on the efficiency of CAF treatment. This meta-analysis showed that there is no dose-dependent efficiency of BT injection. Although the total number of injected units of BT ranged between 5 and 150 units per session, there was no statistical difference in the treatment success rate concerning the dosage of BT, for either Botox or Dysport formulations.

However, some authors observed dose-dependent healing rates. For instance, Vinella et al. reported no significant effect of different BT doses (20, 30, and 50 IU) and the site of injection on the healing rate. Moreover, these results align with a randomized controlled trial presented by Brisinda et al. that compared Botox versus Dysport formulations. Using a conversion factor of 1:3 for different BT formulations, there was no significance in the healing rate.

The explanation for comparable results of CAF efficiency regardless of the applied dosage of BT remains unresolved. Some authors indicated diffusion of BT as an important factor that may boost the mechanism of action within the target tissue. Based on histologic staining of acetylcholinesterase, equal distribution of the biological effect of BT was observed within the entire studied muscle when a high dose of BT was applied. In contrast, in other experimental scenarios with a low dose of BT injection, a g.

### Passive antibody administration (immediate immunity) as a specific defense against biological weapons [^114QNND6]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Botulinum toxins are produced by Clostridium botulinum and encompass seven antigenic types known by the letters A through G. These different toxins are defined by specific antisera that are not cross-protective; hence, antibody to toxin A does not neutralize the other toxins. Botulinum toxins are taken up by nerve cells through pinocytosis and exert their effect by binding to neuromuscular junctions and preventing acetylcholine release, leading to muscular paralysis. The damage to the synaptic junction is considered irreversible, with recovery resulting from new axonal growth that may take weeks or months.

Therapy for botulism is largely supportive, although prompt administration of an antitoxin can reduce the severity of symptoms by neutralizing unbound toxin in circulation. Antitoxin therapy for botulism lowers death rates and shortens the duration of symptoms when given within 24 hours of the onset of the disease. An equine trivalent antitoxin, available from the CDC, contains neutralizing antibodies against the most common causes of human botulism: toxin types A, B, and E. For botulism caused by other toxin types, an experimental heptavalent equine serum is available. Given the side effects associated with equine sera, there is great interest in generating human antibody preparations with neutralizing activity against the seven botulinum toxins. Passive administration of human botulinum immune globulin, derived from volunteers vaccinated with a pentavalent botulinum toxoid (ABCDE) vaccine, has been protective in monkeys.

Perniosis (also known as pernio or chilblains) is a condition characterized by the development of pruritic, painful erythrocyanotic skin lesions induced by exposure to cold temperatures. When perniosis occurs in conjunction with clinical or laboratory features of systemic lupus erythematosus, the condition is further classified as chilblain lupus erythematosus (CHLE). CHLE is a rare condition with limited treatment options, especially in refractory cases. Here, we discuss the utility of therapeutic botulinum toxin injections in the treatment of severe, ulcerative CHLE.

### Ulcerative colitis practice guidelines in adults (update): American College of Gastroenterology, Practice Parameters Committee [^112pUEEW]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2004). High credibility.

Guidelines for clinical practice are intended to indicate preferred approaches to medical problems as established by scientifically valid research. Double-blind placebo-controlled studies are preferable, but compassionate use reports and expert review articles are utilized in a thorough review of the literature conducted through Medline with the National Library of Medicine. When only data that will not withstand objective scrutiny are available, a recommendation is identified as a consensus of experts.

Guidelines are applicable to all physicians who address the subject, without regard to the specialty training or interests. They are intended to indicate the preferable but not necessarily the only acceptable approach to a specific problem. Guidelines are intended to be flexible and must be distinguished from standards of care, which are inflexible and rarely violated. Given the wide range of specifics in any health-care problem, the physician must always choose the course best suited to the individual patient and the variables in existence at the moment of decision.

Guidelines are developed under the auspices of the American College of Gastroenterology and its Practice Parameters Committee and approved by the Board of Trustees. Each has been extensively reviewed and revised by the Committee, other experts in the field, physicians who will use them, and specialists in the science of decision analysis. The recommendations of each guideline are therefore considered valid at the time of their production based on the data available.

### Optimal dosing of botulinum toxin for treatment of chronic anal fissure: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^115doTsJ]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2016). Low credibility.

Chronic anal fissures are associated with significant morbidity and reduced quality of life. Studies have investigated the efficacy of botulinum toxin with variable results; thus, there is currently no consensus on botulinum toxin dose or injection sites.
- **Objective**: This study aimed to systematically analyze trials studying the efficacy of botulinum toxin for treatment of chronic anal fissure to identify an optimum dosage and injection regimen.
- **Data sources**: A comprehensive review of the literature was conducted according to PRISMA guidelines. PubMed/Medline, Embase, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library were searched from inception to June 2015.
- **Study selection**: All clinical trials that investigated the efficacy of botulinum toxin for chronic anal fissure were selected according to specific criteria.
- **Interventions**: The interventions used were various doses of botulinum toxin.
- **Outcome measures**: Clinical outcomes, dosage, and injection site data were evaluated with weighted pooled results for each dosage and 95% confidence intervals.
- **Results**: There were 1158 patients, with 661 in botulinum toxin treatment arms, from 18 clinical trials included in this review. The outcomes of interest were 3-month healing, incontinence, and recurrence rates. Meta-regression analysis demonstrated a small decrease in healing rate (0.34%; 95% CI, 0–0.68; p = 0.048) with each increase in dosage, a small increase in incontinence rate (1.02 times; 95% CI, 1.0002–1.049; p = 0.048) with each increase in dosage, and a small increase in recurrence rate (1.037 times; 95% CI, 1.018–1.057; p = …

### Gastrointestinal uses of botulinum toxin [^115koqCy]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2002). Low credibility.

Botulinum toxin was initially used in medicine to produce a potent neuromuscular blockade. It was later found to interfere with acetylcholine release in the myenteric plexus and inhibit contraction in gastrointestinal smooth muscle, leading to its use in the treatment of various conditions. It is frequently used in the treatment of achalasia in elderly patients who may be poor surgical candidates. Additionally, it has been used successfully in the management of various conditions, including anal fissure and biliary dyskinesia. Large controlled trials are needed to establish the role of botulinum toxin and its safety in gastroenterology.

### Bowel urgency in ulcerative colitis: Current perspectives and future directions [^111h1nmL]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Patients with active UC experience sensory changes and increased smooth muscle tone, which may result in hypersensitivity and increased rectal contractile responses due to sensitization of intramural receptors in response to inflammatory changes. However, bowel urgency (BU) does not always equate to active UC. Anorectal dysfunction, particularly rectal hypersensitivity, can persist in quiescent UC. Hypersensitivity contributes to BU as urgency can follow the sensation of rectal filling. It is also associated with functional bowel disorders, which can occur alongside inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).

BU can occur in both active and quiescent UC. Overlooking the possibility of anorectal dysfunction (e.g. anal sphincter "fatigability" and/or hypersensitivity), a contributing factor to BU in quiescent UC, can lead to increased healthcare utilization, including invasive testing and unnecessary escalation of therapy, as well as patient dissatisfaction due to refractory symptoms.

### Treatment with botulinum neurotoxin of gastrointestinal smooth muscles and sphincter spasms [^116ftm3J]. Movement Disorders (2004). Low credibility.

Local injections of botulinum neurotoxin are now considered an efficacious treatment for neurological and non-neurological conditions. One of the most recent achievements in the field is the observation that botulinum neurotoxin provides benefit in diseases of the gastrointestinal tract. Botulinum neurotoxin inhibits contraction of gastrointestinal smooth muscles and sphincters; it has also been shown that the neurotoxin blocks cholinergic nerve endings in the autonomic nervous system, but it does not block nonadrenergic responses mediated by nitric oxide. This aspect has further promoted the interest in using botulinum neurotoxin as a treatment for overactive smooth muscles, such as the anal sphincters, to treat anal fissure and outlet-type constipation, or the lower esophageal sphincter to treat esophageal achalasia.

An understanding of the anatomical and functional organization of innervation of the gastrointestinal tract is a prerequisite to comprehending many features of botulinum neurotoxin action on the gut and the effects of injections placed into specific sphincters. This review presents data on the use of botulinum neurotoxin to treat diseases of the gastrointestinal tract and summarizes recent knowledge on the pathogenesis of disorders of the gut due to dysfunction of the enteric nervous system.

### Botox [^112hi3NB]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Spread of toxin effect**: Postmarketing safety data from Botox and other approved botulinum toxins suggest that botulinum toxin effects may, in some cases, be observed beyond the site of local injection. The symptoms are consistent with the mechanism of action of botulinum toxin and may include asthenia, generalized muscle weakness, diplopia, ptosis, dysphagia, dysphonia, dysarthria, urinary incontinence, and breathing difficulties. These symptoms have been reported hours to weeks after injection. Swallowing and breathing difficulties can be life-threatening, and there have been reports of death related to the spread of toxin effects. The risk of symptoms is probably greatest in children treated for spasticity, but symptoms can also occur in adults treated for spasticity and other conditions, particularly in those patients who have an underlying condition that would predispose them to these symptoms. In unapproved uses and in approved indications, symptoms consistent with the spread of toxin effect have been reported at doses comparable to or lower than doses used to treat cervical dystonia and spasticity. Patients or caregivers should be advised to seek immediate medical care if swallowing, speech, or respiratory disorders occur.

No definitive serious adverse event reports of distant spread of toxin effect associated with Botox for blepharospasm at the recommended dose (30 units and below), severe primary axillary hyperhidrosis at the recommended dose (100 units), strabismus, or chronic migraine at the labeled doses have been reported.

### Botulinum neurotoxin and other treatments for fissure-in-ano and pelvic floor disorders [^111dqVnz]. The British Journal of Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

The management of disorders of the lower gastrointestinal tract, such as chronic anal fissure and pelvic floor dysfunction, has undergone re-evaluation recently. To a large extent, this is due to the advent of neurochemical treatments, such as botulinum neurotoxin injections and topical nitrate ointment.
- **Methods and results**: This review presents data on the use of botulinum neurotoxin to treat lower gastrointestinal tract diseases, such as chronic anal fissure, for which it promotes healing and symptom relief in up to 70 percent of cases. This agent has also been used selectively to weaken the external anal sphincter and puborectalis muscle in constipation and in Parkinson's disease. Symptomatic improvement can also be induced in anterior rectocele by botulinum neurotoxin injections.
- **Conclusion**: Botulinum neurotoxin appears to be a safe therapy for anal fissure. It is more efficacious than nitrate application and does not require patient compliance to complete treatment. While it may also be a promising approach for the treatment of chronic constipation due to pelvic floor dysfunction, further investigation of its efficacy and safety in this role is needed before general usage can be advocated.

### Botulinum toxin for provoked vestibulodynia [^116pTjr2]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Low credibility.

Vulvodynia is a common pain disorder among premenopausal women, with an estimated prevalence of 8.3% to 16% among women in the United States. Provoked vestibulodynia (PVD), previously known as vulvar vestibulitis syndrome (VVS), is the most frequently reported subcategory of vulvodynia and the most common reason for sexual pain in young women. According to the 2015 Consensus Terminology and Classification of Persistent Vulvar Pain and Vulvodynia, PVD refers to pain at the openings of the urethra and vagina (the vulvar vestibule) that lasts for more than three months and occurs without the presence of any other identifiable vulvar disease. Although the cause is unclear, various psychosocial and pathophysiological factors are thought to play a role in the onset and persistence of this pain.

Societal misconceptions and stigmatization often surround this condition, contributing to the suffering of those affected. Moreover, the historical under-representation of women's health issues in research and funding exacerbates the challenges faced by those with vestibulodynia.
- **Description of the intervention and how it might work**: Non-pharmacological treatments, pharmacological treatments, and surgical interventions have been tested for vulvodynia, both individually and in combination. Non-pharmacological options mainly include variations of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), pelvic floor physical therapy, and alternative therapies such as acupuncture and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS). Pharmacological treatments include muscle relaxants.

### Dysport [^111taUvo]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Spread of toxin effect**: Postmarketing safety data from Dysport and other approved botulinum toxins suggest that botulinum toxin effects may, in some cases, be observed beyond the site of local injection. The symptoms are consistent with the mechanism of action of botulinum toxin and may include asthenia, generalized muscle weakness, diplopia, blurred vision, ptosis, dysphagia, dysphonia, dysarthria, urinary incontinence, and breathing difficulties. These symptoms have been reported hours to weeks after injection. Swallowing and breathing difficulties can be life-threatening, and there have been reports of death related to the spread of toxin effects. The risk of symptoms is probably greatest in children treated for spasticity, but symptoms can also occur in adults treated for spasticity and other conditions, particularly in those patients who have underlying conditions that would predispose them to these symptoms. In unapproved uses and approved indications, symptoms consistent with the spread of toxin effect have been reported at doses comparable to or lower than the maximum recommended total dose.
- **Lack of interchangeability between botulinum toxin products**: The potency units of Dysport are specific to the preparation and assay method utilized. They are not interchangeable with other preparations of botulinum toxin products and, therefore, units of biological activity of Dysport cannot be compared to or converted into units of any other botulinum toxin products assessed with any other specific assay method.
- **Hypersensitivity reactions**: Serious hypersensitivity reactions may occur, requiring immediate medical intervention.

### Botulinum toxin type A in the treatment of Raynaud's phenomenon [^114MnEDE]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Raynaud's phenomenon is a vasospastic disorder affecting the palmar and digital vessels of the hands and feet, which can lead to ischemic ulcers, pain, and loss of function. This study reviews patients who received injections of botulinum toxin type A for the treatment of Raynaud's phenomenon.
- **Methods**: Raynaud's patients were injected with 50 to 100 units of onabotulinumtoxinA to improve digit perfusion. An institutional review board-approved retrospective review was conducted to analyze outcomes. Laser Doppler scans were performed before and after injection to quantitatively measure perfusion.
- **Results**: A total of 14 men and 19 women with Raynaud's phenomenon received onabotulinumtoxinA injections. All but five patients experienced improved vascularity and relief from pain. Laser Doppler scans demonstrated notable improvements in perfusion. Five patients required repeat injections for pain relief.
- **Conclusions**: Botulinum toxin appears to enhance hand perfusion following direct injection around the neurovascular bundles. Further research is needed to identify the precise mode of action in relieving vasospasm and alleviating pain.

### Xeomin [^115wwgqz]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Warning: Distant spread of toxin effect**: Postmarketing reports indicate that the effects of Xeomin and all botulinum toxin products may spread from the area of injection, producing symptoms consistent with botulinum toxin effects. These may include asthenia, generalized muscle weakness, diplopia, blurred vision, ptosis, dysphagia, dysphonia, dysarthria, urinary incontinence, and breathing difficulties. These symptoms have been reported from hours to weeks after injection. Swallowing and breathing difficulties can be life-threatening, and there have been reports of death. The risk of symptoms is probably greatest in children treated for spasticity, but symptoms can also occur in adults treated for spasticity and other conditions, particularly in those patients who have underlying conditions that would predispose them to these symptoms. In unapproved uses, including lower limb spasticity in children, and in approved indications, cases of spread of effect have been reported at doses comparable to those used to treat cervical dystonia and at lower doses [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].
- **Complete prescribing information**: See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning. The effects of Xeomin and all botulinum toxin products may spread from the area of injection to produce symptoms consistent with botulinum toxin effects.

In the context of medical management for botulism, particularly regarding antitoxin therapy, the CDC's 2021 guidelines recommend administering botulinum antitoxin to patients with suspected botulism who exhibit progressing symptoms or signs, such as paralysis, irrespective of the elapsed time since symptom onset. It is important to recognize that patients with suspected botulism who display non-progressing symptoms and lack remaining voluntary muscle function are less likely to benefit from antitoxin treatment, especially after more than seven days since symptom onset, as the toxin is infrequently detected beyond this phase of illness.

### A summary of the BRIDGe summit on damage-related progression of ulcerative colitis: Establishing research priorities [^112GbdoW]. Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

A deeper understanding of ulcerative colitis (UC) as a disease associated with bowel damage and progression will only be possible with broad awareness of its manifestations and clinical consequences among both clinicians and patients. Among clinicians, this will require an understanding that a healed mucosa may not equate to a healed bowel. It will require a commitment to exploring underlying causes of persistent symptoms beyond algorithms and to identifying and using new tools to measure these outcomes. Persistent clinical symptoms despite endoscopic remission are often attributed to irritable bowel syndrome without further investigation or adequate understanding of the underlying causes. However, symptoms may be explained by ongoing histologic or molecular disease activity that is not detectable by endoscopy or biochemical markers currently available. Alternatively, alterations to bowel wall layers deeper than the mucosa, dysmotility, and/or reduction in bowel wall compliance may be driving these symptoms and could, therefore, represent UC-related bowel damage.

At the same time, patients will require an understanding that achieving endoscopic remission may not translate into normalization of symptoms. Conversely, despite improvement in mucosal inflammation or clinical symptoms, bowel damage may have occurred, leading to disease progression and worse outcomes.

### Botulinum toxin: Basic science and clinical uses in otolaryngology [^117VZtEJ]. The Laryngoscope (2001). Low credibility.

The role of botulinum toxin as a therapeutic agent is expanding rapidly in otolaryngology. Botulinum toxin is a protease that blocks the release of acetylcholine from nerve terminals. Its effects are transient and nondestructive, largely limited to the area in which it is administered. These effects are graded according to dose, allowing for individualized treatment of patients and disorders.

Botulinum toxin has been primarily used to treat disorders of excessive or inappropriate muscle contractions. In the field of otolaryngology, these include conditions such as spasmodic dysphonia, oromandibular dystonia, blepharospasm, vocal tics, stuttering, cricopharyngeal achalasia, various tremors and tics, hemifacial spasm, temporomandibular joint disorders, and several cosmetic applications.

Botulinum toxin treatment has recently shown some benefit in controlling pain from migraine and tension headaches. It may also prove useful in managing autonomic dysfunctions, such as in Frey syndrome, sialorrhea, and rhinorrhea. In over 20 years of use in humans, botulinum toxin has accumulated a considerable safety record and, in many cases, represents relief for thousands of patients unaided by other therapy.

In clinical trials, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, including exacerbations, occurred at a greater frequency in the Taltz group than the placebo control group [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. During Taltz treatment, monitor for onset or exacerbation of inflammatory bowel disease. If IBD occurs, discontinue Taltz and initiate appropriate medical management.
- **Immunizations**: Prior to initiating therapy with Taltz, consider completion of all age-appropriate immunizations according to immunization guidelines. Avoid use of live vaccines in patients treated with Taltz as no data are available on the response to live vaccines.

### The role of botulinum toxin in postparotidectomy fistula treatment. A technical note [^114QKagA]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2006). Low credibility.

Parotid fistula is a well-known complication of parotidectomy or penetrating injury to the parotid gland. The management of parotid fistula has been controversial, with numerous conservative and surgical treatment methods described.

We report three cases of parotid fistula after partial parotidectomy, treated by botulinum toxin injection under electromyographic control into the residual substance of the parotid gland.

Complete healing of the fistula was achieved with a single botulinum toxin treatment in all patients. No side effects were observed after the treatment. The patients remained disease-free after 21, 18, and 14 months, respectively.

In the considered cases, the localized injection of botulinum toxin into the parotid gland proved to be an effective and long-lasting treatment for postparotidectomy fistula.

### The use of botulinum toxin in Raynaud phenomenon: A comprehensive literature review [^111JDnSE]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2023). Low credibility.

Raynaud phenomenon (RP) is a vasospastic condition of the digits that can be primary or secondary to systemic disease. Symptoms are triggered by cold or stress and can cause pain and skin color changes. Chronic ischemia may lead to necrosis, ulceration, and amputation. There are no Food and Drug Administration-approved treatments, and cases refractory to pharmacological and surgical treatments are difficult to control. Local botulinum toxin injections have been increasingly used in the treatment of Raynaud disease and have shown promising results.
- **Aim of the study**: To examine the outcomes, techniques, and complications of botulinum toxin use for the treatment of Raynaud disease.
- **Methods**: The PubMed database was queried using "botulinum toxin" AND "Raynaud phenomenon" as title keywords. Preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis criteria were used. Additional articles were selected while reviewing the references of the articles from PubMed. No time restrictions were followed. Articles of all languages were included. Articles were analyzed for study type, demographics, diagnosis/inclusion criteria, treatment methods, outcome measures, length of follow-up, results, and complications. A positive outcome was defined as subjective improvement in symptoms and/or improvement in the outcome measures. A poor outcome was defined as harm done to the patient by the injection that would not have occurred otherwise.
- **Results**: Forty-two clinical studies describing the use of botulinum toxin for Raynaud's phenomenon were found. A total of 425 patients were included in these studies.

### Botulinum toxin-a: A novel treatment for livedoid vasculopathy [^1142xMBT]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Low credibility.

A 20-year-old woman presented with an 8-month history of painful ulcers that would slowly heal as white scars on her bilateral lower extremities. She was otherwise healthy and reported 4/10 pain localized to the active ulcers, 8/10 lower extremity neuropathic pain, and edema with prolonged standing. The examination demonstrated retiform purpuric patches, crusted purple papules, and superficial ulcers associated with white ivory plaques on her bilateral malleoli and dorsal aspect of the feet. Punch biopsies supported the diagnosis of LV. No underlying thrombophilia or autoimmune connective tissue disease was identified. Lower extremity ankle-brachial indices, venous ultrasound, Doppler, electromyography, and nerve conduction studies were normal bilaterally.

### Botulinum toxin injection for treatment of chronic anal fissure: Is there any dose-dependent efficiency? A meta-analysis [^1156hgbN]. World Journal of Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Based on the present meta-analysis, there is no botulinum toxin (BT) dose-dependent efficiency for chronic anal fissure (CAF). Moreover, postoperative incontinence rate as well as complication rate is not related to the BT dosage. There was also no difference in healing rate observed with regard to the injection site and the number of injections per session. Further studies are needed to evaluate the real value and optimal dose of BT for CAF management. Moreover, firm and unequivocal criteria for the definition of CAF, endpoints, and the evaluation of outcomes are needed in order to establish the optimal dose of BT injection for CAF treatment.

### Botulinum toxin A: its expanding role in dermatology and esthetics [^111oF5hJ]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2003). Low credibility.

Use of botulinum toxin A in cosmetic dermatology has increased in popularity due to the efficacy and relative safety of the treatment. Botulinum toxin A is one of eight exotoxins produced by *Clostridium botulinum*, a Gram-positive, spore-forming anaerobe. Flaccid paralysis results from the denervation of muscle fibers at the neuromuscular junction after botulinum toxin A administration. While treating blepharospasm, the Carruthers incidentally found that botulinum toxin A improved glabellar frown lines. Dynamic rhytides occur in areas of dynamic motion, and these types of lines may be improved with botulinum toxin A.

There are two types of botulinum toxin A commercially available: BOTOX and Dysport. However, only BOTOX is currently available in the United States. The efficacy and tolerability of BOTOX were best demonstrated with a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study on the efficacy and safety of botulinum toxin type A in the treatment of glabellar lines in 264 patients. The study showed a significantly greater reduction in glabellar line severity with BOTOX, with effects maintained for the duration of the study (120 days). A low occurrence (5.4%) of mostly mild blepharoptosis was observed in the BOTOX group. In another prospective study, it was found that about 1% of BOTOX patients reported severe headaches.

Botulinum toxin A can provide an alternative treatment for palmar and axillary hyperhidrosis when options such as topical agents (e.g. aluminum chloride) and iontophoresis have failed.

Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by mucosal inflammation starting distally in the rectum, with continuous extension proximally for a variable distance, often with an abrupt demarcation between inflamed and non-inflamed mucosa. Typically, patients with UC experience periods of relapse and remission. Up to 90% will have one or more relapses after the first attack, and early relapse or active disease in the first 2 years is associated with a worse disease course subsequently.
- **Diagnosis**: Where ulcerative colitis is diagnosed by sigmoidoscopy, we recommend a full ileocolonoscopy to delineate disease extent, severity of inflammation, and to exclude Crohn's disease (GRADE: strong recommendation, very low-quality evidence, agreement: 100%).

In patients presenting with suspected UC, stool cultures and *Clostridium difficile* toxin assay should always be performed to rule out infective causes. While UC is often initially diagnosed at flexible (or rigid) sigmoidoscopy, it is important to confirm the diagnosis, extent, and severity of disease by means of full ileocolonoscopy, usually within the first year. This can more definitively confirm the diagnosis of UC versus Crohn's disease and provide information that may help to predict future disease course, including potential risk stratification for dysplasia, and thus will influence treatment choices. For histological assessment, at least two biopsy specimens should be taken from five sites throughout the examined bowel, including the ileum and rectum.

### Patient registry of spasticity care world: Data analysis based on physician experience [^115EqogT]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2017). Low credibility.

Botulinum toxin has become a widely used biological toxin for a growing number of clinical applications. Clinical trials provide evidence that botulinum toxin can improve symptoms of muscle overactivity when appropriate muscles, doses, and the number of injection sites are selected. The proper use of these treatments in a "real-world" setting, which is not restricted to a regimented dosing structure provided by a clinical trial, requires appropriate training and education. As in other areas of medicine, physician experience may play a role in care delivery. Physician level of experience may serve as a surrogate in understanding physician practice patterns variation that can inform healthcare services use and reduce physician care variations. Given these information voids, we proposed and conducted a global, multicenter, observational study of participants treated with botulinum toxins in patients with stroke- or TBI-related spastic muscle overactivity to generate real-world data.

Use of botulinum toxin A varies internationally; onabotulinumtoxinA (onaBoNTA) BOTOX has been approved for use in the United States for many years, whereas abobotulinumtoxinA (aboBoNTA) Dysport and incobotulinumtoxinA (incoBoNTA) Xeomin were only recently approved (2016). The onaBoNTA and aboBoNTA have been in use in Europe for more than 20 years, and incoBoNTA was approved only 10 years ago. Published registries have presented real-life data on the treatment of spasticity with onaBoNTA; however, to our knowledge, this is the first international registry that includes real-world longitudinal data.

### Emerging role of botulinum toxin in the management of voiding dysfunction [^116Divub]. The Journal of Urology (2004). Low credibility.

In recent years, there has been tremendous excitement over the use of botulinum neurotoxin (BTX) to treat various urethral and bladder dysfunctions. BTX is the most potent, naturally occurring toxin known to mankind. Why, then, would a urologist want to use this agent to poison the bladder or urethral sphincter?

We reviewed the recent literature on the mechanisms underlying the effects of BTX treatment and discussed the use of this agent within the urological community, as well as provided perspective on future targets of BTX. The information was gathered from MEDLINE, abstracts from recent urological meetings, and personal experience.

Injection of BTX appears to have a positive therapeutic effect in multiple urological conditions, including detrusor hyperreflexia and detrusor external sphincter dyssynergia, and nonneurogenic conditions such as pelvic floor spasticity, refractory overactive bladder, and, possibly, benign prostatic hyperplasia. Interstitial cystitis may even be potentially helped with bladder BTX injection.

Botulinum toxin is a novel and promising treatment for a variety of lower urinary tract dysfunctions. The basic science behind its mechanism of action and physiology, and published clinical results, are impressive. However, since the application of BTX in the lower urinary tract has not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration, caution should be used until properly designed, multicenter randomized studies are completed to assess the safety and efficacy of BTX in urological diseases.

### Treating chronic anal fissure with botulinum neurotoxin [^113Bb7p1]. Nature Clinical Practice. Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2004). Low credibility.

Recent reports confirm that the management of chronic anal fissure has undergone extensive re-evaluation during the past few years. This rejuvenation of interest is attributable to the application of neurochemical treatment, which has contributed to the tendency to treat the disease on an outpatient basis.

Use of botulinum neurotoxin seems to be a promising and safe approach for the treatment of chronic anal fissure, particularly in patients at high risk for incontinence. Indeed, botulinum neurotoxin has been successfully used selectively to weaken the internal anal sphincter as a treatment for chronic anal fissure. It is also more efficacious than nitrate therapy and is not related to the patient's willingness to complete treatment.

### Daxxify [^111ndGED]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Spread of toxin effect**: Postmarketing safety data from other approved botulinum toxins suggest that botulinum toxin effects may be observed beyond the site of local injection. The symptoms, consistent with the mechanism of action of botulinum toxin, may include asthenia, generalized muscle weakness, diplopia, blurred vision, ptosis, dysphagia, dysphonia, dysarthria, urinary incontinence, and breathing difficulties. These symptoms have been reported hours to weeks after injection. Swallowing and breathing difficulties can be life-threatening, and there have been reports of death related to the spread of toxin effects. The risk of symptoms is greatest in children treated for spasticity, an unapproved use for Daxxify, but symptoms can occur in adults treated for spasticity and other conditions and particularly in those patients who have underlying conditions that would predispose them to these symptoms. In unapproved uses, including upper limb spasticity in children, and approved indications, symptoms consistent with the spread of toxin effect have been reported at doses comparable to, or lower than, the maximum recommended total dose. Patients or caregivers should be advised to seek immediate medical care if swallowing, speech, or respiratory difficulties occur.
- **Lack of interchangeability between botulinum toxin products**: The potency units of Daxxify are specific to the preparation and assay method utilized. They are not interchangeable with other preparations of botulinum toxin products; therefore, units of biological activity of Daxxify cannot be compared to or…

### Interaction of botulinum toxin type A with local anesthetic agents: An experimental study with rabbits [^1168Riwp]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Injection of botulinum toxin is a painful procedure, limiting the number of patients treated. This study was designed to establish whether infiltration of local anesthetics plays a role in the effectiveness of botulinum toxin. For the study, 24 New Zealand white rabbits were divided into three groups. In all three groups, local anesthetics (prilocaine, lidocaine, lidocaine, and epinephrine) were injected into the right anterior auricular muscle before a 2.5-U injection of botox A. The contralateral anterior auricular muscle of all the rabbits was injected with the same dose of the toxin to serve as a control. Photographic documentation was recorded; electromyographic study was performed; and results were statistically analyzed. The results show that local anesthetics do not play a role in the efficacy of botulinum toxin. Thus, the use of infiltrative local anesthetics before botulinum toxin injection is a safe method for achieving a less painful procedure for the patient.

### Botulinum toxin injection for treatment of chronic anal fissure: Is there any dose-dependent efficiency? A meta-analysis [^115wASZr]. World Journal of Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Although the underlying pathology of achalasia, the course of the disease, and the response to botulinum toxin (BT) treatment differ, there is no observed dose-dependent efficiency. A recent large multicenter study found that administering 100 IU of BT (repeated one month later) was more efficacious than either 50 or 200 IU. Cuillière et al. reached the same conclusion, as increasing the dose of BT from 100 to 200 IU did not significantly augment the success rate.

To limit publication bias, appropriate selection of studies was performed. However, this meta-analysis has several limitations. The time of outcome evaluation ranged from 4 to 156 weeks after BT injection, possibly influencing the efficiency rate. Although BT may hasten the treatment of anal fissures, we did not find any significant correlation between the timing of BT injection and its efficiency.

Despite detailed study selection, heterogeneity among analyzed studies exists due to the surgeon's preference, experience, and the heterogeneity of the patient sample. Furthermore, the methodology of outcome evaluation differed among studies, influencing result interpretation. Clinical examinations were performed in all studies; however, questionnaires and anorectal methodologies were implemented in ten and nineteen studies, respectively. Additionally, most studies were not designed as double-blinded, which may impact the outcomes.

### Dysport [^111vhfT4]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Spread of toxin effect**: Postmarketing safety data from Dysport and other approved botulinum toxins suggest that botulinum toxin effects may, in some cases, be observed beyond the site of local injection. The symptoms are consistent with the mechanism of action of botulinum toxin and may include asthenia, generalized muscle weakness, diplopia, blurred vision, ptosis, dysphagia, dysphonia, dysarthria, urinary incontinence, and breathing difficulties. These symptoms have been reported hours to weeks after injection. Swallowing and breathing difficulties can be life-threatening, and there have been reports of death related to the spread of toxin effects. The risk of symptoms is probably greatest in children treated for spasticity, but symptoms can also occur in adults treated for spasticity and other conditions, particularly in those patients who have underlying conditions that would predispose them to these symptoms. In unapproved uses and approved indications, symptoms consistent with the spread of toxin effect have been reported at doses comparable to or lower than the maximum recommended total dose.
- **Lack of interchangeability between botulinum toxin products**: The potency units of Dysport are specific to the preparation and assay method utilized. They are not interchangeable with other preparations of botulinum toxin products. Therefore, units of biological activity of Dysport cannot be compared to or converted into units of any other botulinum toxin products assessed with any other specific assay method [see Description (11)].
- **Hypersensitivity reactions**: Serious hypersensitivity reactions have been reported with Dysport use and require immediate medical intervention.

### Botulinum toxin injection for treatment of chronic anal fissure: Is there any dose-dependent efficiency? A meta-analysis [^1159a4tk]. World Journal of Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Only 2.2% of patients (n = 35) developed perianal complications due to BT injection based on the presented meta-analysis. Thus, this result confirmed the advantage of BT injection regarding postoperative complications when compared to lateral internal sphincterotomy (LIS). Chen et al. concluded that LIS is superior to BT for CAF considering healing rate and recurrence rate. However, BT injection was recommended for patients who either refuse surgical management, were previously treated with LIS, or are at risk of developing postoperative incontinence (such as women with many vaginal deliveries, previous anal surgery, or previously diagnosed incontinence). The overall incontinence rate based on this meta-analysis was established at 5.01% (n = 79). Importantly, the majority of patients reported only transient flatus or mucus incontinence that lasted up to 8 weeks postoperatively and disappeared spontaneously.

### Botulinum toxin for the treatment of congenital entropion [^116ZioQn]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2004). Low credibility.

To describe a case of congenital entropion presenting with ulcerative keratitis that was successfully treated with a single injection of botulinum toxin, an interventional case report was conducted.

A 3-week-old female infant with a corneal ulcer of the left eye since birth presented for evaluation. She was found to have entropion of the left lower lid. The pretarsal orbicularis muscle was injected with 5 units of botulinum toxin. Four days after treatment, the entropion had resolved, and the corneal epithelial defect had healed. There was no recurrence of the entropion 7 months after botulinum toxin injection.

Injection of botulinum toxin can effectively treat certain cases of congenital entropion.
