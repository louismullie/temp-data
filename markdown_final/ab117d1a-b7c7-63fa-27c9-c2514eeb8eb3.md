## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to determine Barry's age given the average age of his three sisters and the average age of Barry plus his three sisters. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about translating the averages into total ages. Then, I should verify the difference between the two totals to isolate Barry's age. Finally, I will double-check the arithmetic and select the correct option from the choices provided.

> Let me first confirm the given information and what it implies mathematically. The average age of Barry's three sisters is 27, so the total age of the sisters is 3 times 27, which equals 81 years. The average age of Barry and his three sisters is 28, so the total age of all four people is 4 times 28, which equals 112 years. Wait, let me verify those multiplications: 3 × 27 is indeed 81, and 4 × 28 is indeed 112, so the setup is correct.

> Next, I should review how to isolate Barry's age. The difference between the total age of all four people and the total age of the three sisters will give Barry's age. So, 112 minus 81 equals 31. Hold on, I should double-check that subtraction: 112 − 81 is 31, which matches option E.

> I will now examine the answer choices to ensure there isn't a trap or a misread. The options are 1, 30, 4, 29, and 31. My calculation consistently yields 31, and none of the other options fit the algebra, so the correct choice is E.

> But wait, what if I had misapplied the average formula? Let me reconsider the logic to avoid a mistake. If I mistakenly thought the sisters' total was 27 and the group total was 28, I might have concluded Barry is 1 year old, which corresponds to option A; however, that would ignore that 27 is already an average, not a total, so that approach would be incorrect. The correct approach is to multiply averages by counts to get totals before subtracting, which confirms Barry is 31 years old.

---

Barry is **31 years old**. Here's the math: the three sisters have a total age of 3 × 27 = 81 years, and the four-person total is 4 × 28 = 112 years; therefore, Barry's age is 112 − 81 = 31 years. The correct answer is **E. 31**.

---

## Step-by-step solution

Let S be the sum of the ages of Barry's three sisters, and let B be Barry's age.

- **The average age of the three sisters is 27, so**:

S / 3 = 27 ⇒ S = 81

- **The average age of Barry and his three sisters is 28, so**:

(B + S) / 4 = 28 ⇒ B + S = 112

- **Substitute S = 81 into the second equation**:

B + 81 = 112 ⇒ B = 112 − 81 = 31

---

Therefore, Barry is **31 years old**, which corresponds to option **E**.

### Age of onset in familial breast cancer as background data for medical surveillance [^4715dd10]. British Journal of Cancer (2010). Low credibility.

Table 3 shows the ages at which women with a maternal or sororal history of breast cancer reach the cumulative incidence of 0.36% for breast cancer, that is, the risk that women without a family history reached by the age 40 of years (see Figure 1), according to the diagnostic age of the affected family member. The age difference at diagnosis due to family history decreased from 9.5 years when the mother was diagnosed at an age below 40 years to 0.8 years when she was diagnosed at an age over 82 years. The age difference for sisters decreased from 7.0 years (sister diagnosed before the age of 40 years) to 0.9 years (sister diagnosed between 60 and 72 years). Fatal events were too few for a detailed analysis.

Women with an affected mother and sister, and women with more than one affected sister were considered separately (data not shown). The numbers of women affected by breast cancer in these groups were small. For women with a mother and a sister affected, the ages to reach the same risk as the general population at the age of 50 and 40 years were 41.3 years (33 cases until this age, 95% confidence interval (CI): 39.2–43.1 years) and 32.8 years (7 cases, 95% CI: 31.4–36.3 years), respectively. The corresponding ages for women with two affected sisters were 42.3 years (11 cases, 95% CI: 33.4–44.9 years) and 25.8 years (2 cases, 95% CI: 23.3–38.1 years), respectively. The numbers of deaths in women with a mother and a sister affected (27) or with two affected sisters (12) were too small for a separate analysis.

### All alcohol exposure counts-testing parental, older sibling, best friend and peer exposure on young adolescent drinking in a seven-wave longitudinal study [^67e2f813]. Addiction (2023). Medium credibility.

Exposure to best friends', peers' and older siblings' alcohol use

Adolescents were asked: 'How often have you seen the following people drink alcohol in the past 4 weeks?' — oldest brother/sister, best friend and peers. Adolescents then reported on the frequency of their exposure to alcohol use by these three groups (if any) using a 5‐point Likert scale, ranging from 0 ('never') to 6 ('every day'). These were recoded into frequency per week: 0 (never), 0.5 (1–3 days a month), 1.5 (1–2 days a week), 3.5 (3–4 days a week), 5.5 (5–6 days a week) to 7 (every day).

Older sibling

Participants were asked how many older brothers and sisters (including any step‐ or half‐siblings) they had, which was coded into 0 = 'no siblings', 1 = 'have siblings'.

Time‐point

The data collection time‐point ranged from 0 (T1, baseline) to 6 (T7).

Demographics (baseline = T0)

Adolescents reported their sex and age.

Analytical strategy

First, χ 2 and t ‐tests were conducted in SPSS version 27 to test potential differences between those with and without siblings on a bivariate level (the first model, discussed below, then tests this same association in a mutually adjusted way). We considered the 0.1% α‐error level as the significance threshold because the cluster sampling design of having time‐points nested within individuals may have affected standard errors. Following descriptive analyses, a series of multi‐level logistic regression analyses were performed in Mplus to account for the nesting of time‐points (first level of analysis) within individuals (second level of analyses). Of 5355 potential data points (n = 765 × 7 waves), 5112 data points (95.4%) were available due to incomplete questionnaires. Current analysis is based on all observed values whereby missing data points (4.6%) were handled through the full‐information maximum likelihood option in Mplus, which provides unbiased estimates with values missing at random. To account for the increase of alcohol use over time, we included the time‐point as a predictor in all models.

### Age of onset in familial breast cancer as background data for medical surveillance [^154ea504]. British Journal of Cancer (2010). Low credibility.

Table 2 (top part) shows the ages at which women with a maternal or sororal history of breast cancer reach the cumulative incidence of 1.7% for breast cancer, that is, the risk that women without a family history reached by the age of 50 years (see Figure 1), according to the diagnostic age of the affected family member. The age difference at diagnosis due to family history is shown by 'AD', which decreased from 12.3 years when the mother was diagnosed at age below 40 years to 3.3 years when she was diagnosed at age over 82 years. The age difference for sisters decreased from 8.9 years (sister diagnosed before the age of 40 years) to 3.0 years (sister diagnosed between 60 and 72 years). Data for age differences in mortality are shown in Table 2 (bottom part). There were few fatal events but the trend was essentially similar to the incidence data: diagnosis at an early age in one family member also predicted an early death of the second family member.

Discussion

Our results provide initial data on the age of onset of familial cancer estimated with a large population-based data set. For example, if the general starting age of mammography screening is defined to be 50 years, our data show that the same cumulative risk is reached 9–12 years earlier for women with a mother or a sister affected by breast cancer before 40 years. According to previous recommendations, an earlier start of screening is not recommended for women with mother or sister who was affected older than 50 years. However, the present results indicated that these women are at an increased risk. The estimation of the age at which familial cases reached the risk of death in women without a family history permitted essentially identical conclusions, even though the results were based on a smaller numbers of events.

The American Cancer Society recommends average-risk women begin mammography screening at the age of 40 years. In the European Union, the Advisory Committee on Cancer Prevention recommends the introduction of organised mammography screening beginning at 50 years. In most nationally organised programmes in Europe and Canada, the starting age of mammography screening is 50 years. These screening programmes do not take the family history of breast cancer into consideration, although some guidelines recommend individual strategies when risk factors are present. The National Board of Health and Welfare recommends Swedish counties to offer mammography screening for women at the age of 40–74 years. There are differences between counties when they start screening and the screening interval. The American Cancer Society recommends MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) screening as an adjunct to mammography screening for women with an estimated 20–25% or greater lifetime risk of breast cancer. However, the starting age of screening for breast cancer in women at increased risk is not well established. The National Center for Clinical Excellence in the United Kingdom recommends annual mammography screening for at-risk women beginning at the age of 40 years, which is 10 years earlier than the recommended starting age in the United Kingdom for the general population; the increased risk is defined as an estimated lifetime risk of breast cancer between 17–30%, which includes women with a first-degree relative affected by breast cancer before 50 years and women with two affected first- or second-degree relatives. The American Cancer Society recommends women with a relative affected by breast cancer before 50 years, with two or more relatives affected by breast cancer and with a relative affected by two independent breast cancers to start 10 years earlier than average-risk women, or 5–10 years earlier than the youngest patient in the family.

### Associations between father absence and age of first sexual intercourse [^c4a2731a]. Child Development (2009). Low credibility.

Children raised without a biological father in the household have earlier average ages of first sexual intercourse than children raised in father-present households. Competing theoretical perspectives have attributed this either to effects of father absence on socialization and physical maturation or to nonrandom selection of children predisposed for early sexual intercourse into father-absent households. Genetically informative analyses of the children of sister dyads (N = 1,382, aged 14–21 years) support the selection hypothesis: This association seems attributable to confounded risks, most likely genetic in origin, which correlated both with likelihood of father absence and early sexual behavior. This holds implications for environmental theories of maturation and suggests that previous research may have inadvertently overestimated the role of family structure in reproductive maturation.

### Life review in advanced age: qualitative research on the 'start in life' of 90-year-olds in the lothian birth cohort 1921 [^3bdc7688]. BMC Geriatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Many participants commented on how values and good habits were emphasized in their families. Household chores, and in some cases farm chores, instilled values around hard physical work, cleanliness and responsibility:

"We were given daily tasks to perform. Such as washing dishes–sweeping floors etc. I was also put in charge of a younger sister & was responsible for her safety. I also had a job delivering newspapers, morning & evening". (M)

Loyalty to the family, helping each other, considering the needs of others and the learning of Christian ethics were other values emphasised:

"… while in a way I had quite a strict upbringing I soon learned what the difference was between right & wrong". (F)

"I learned to appreciate what I had & to help & care for people". (F)

"I learned the family came first, an unwritten rule in Shetland, where large families were the norm". (F)

Only a few referred to very strict parents:

"My mother was the disciplinarian in our house, she set out the rules and regulations, being stubborn I seem to remember going to bed quite often with a sore rear end". (M)

A number of participants mentioned siblings and their position in the family. Brothers and sisters were part of a warmly remembered family life for many. Oldest children sometimes mentioned extra household and caring responsibilities, while youngest children tended to sound carefree.

Family dynamics involving favouritism or unfavourable comparisons with siblings cropped up in very few accounts:

"I had a very talented elder sister and a much younger brother. I wanted to please my parents but found it difficult to fit in". (F)

Not having siblings was not necessarily regretted:

"I was an only child, and so enjoyed the undivided attention of two loving parents". (M)

### High constant incidence in twins and other relatives of women with breast cancer [^66f256fd]. Nature Genetics (2000). Medium credibility.

The incidence of breast cancer rises steeply between ages 25 and 50, and more slowly thereafter. In contrast, the incidence in the unaffected (contralateral) breast of women who have had breast cancer remains constant at about 0.7% per year for at least the next 20 years after diagnosis, irrespective of age at first diagnosis. The incidence in relatives of the patients seems to show a similar pattern. The incidence in a prospective study of monozygotic twins of patients was approximately constant at 1.3% per year (77 cases), again about 0.7% per breast. At ages older than a patient's age at diagnosis, her mother and sisters have an incidence of 0.3–0.4% per year. Above the index patient's age at diagnosis, the rate in relatives shows no temporal trend and is independent of the patient's age at diagnosis. A statistically simple explanation is that incidence in susceptible women increases to a high constant level by a predetermined age that varies between families, but this seems inconsistent with conventional models of carcinogenesis and susceptibility. The very high incidence in monozygotic twins of patients indicates that a high proportion, and perhaps the majority, of breast cancers arise in a susceptible minority of women.

### Timing of familial breast cancer in sisters [^6dc0976f]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Women who have had a first-degree relative diagnosed with breast cancer (ie, a positive family history) have a rate of breast cancer that is approximately twice that of all women their age, but it is unclear how they should perceive this risk at different ages or if they should be considered at higher risk for the remainder of their lifetime.

Methods

We used Swedish population-based data to assess the risk of breast cancer in 23,654 sisters of women diagnosed with breast cancer and in 1,732,775 sisters of unaffected women from 1958 through 2001. Poisson models were used to express the rate of breast cancer as a function of current age, whether a woman had an affected sister, time since the first diagnosis in the family, and family size (number of sisters). The effect of the age of the index case (the first sister diagnosed in the family) at diagnosis and whether her "at-risk" sisters had achieved this age were examined in stratified analyses. Incidence rate ratios of breast cancer in exposed compared with unexposed sisters were calculated with 95% confidence intervals. All estimates were adjusted for calendar time.

Results

Sisters of breast cancer patients had higher breast cancer incidence than unexposed sisters at all ages. The association of exposure (ie, a diagnosis of breast cancer in a sister) with the risk of breast cancer was most pronounced in young women (age 20–39; incidence rate ratio = 6.64, 95% confidence interval = 4.66 to 9.48), and the relative risk decreased to approximately 2 in women older than 50 years. The risk associated with having a sister diagnosed with breast cancer was not modified substantially by the age of the index case at diagnosis (≤ 45 years vs > 45 years). The risk was similar for women who were approaching the age at which the first sister was diagnosed in their family and those who had already attained it. The incidence rate ratio of breast cancer in exposed sisters compared with unexposed sisters was constant over time for all age categories of at-risk women.

Conclusions

Women who have a sister diagnosed with breast cancer have an increased risk of breast cancer throughout much of their lifetimes.

### Predicting breast cancer risk: implications of a "weak" family history [^fe114619]. Familial Cancer (2008). Low credibility.

Published guidelines adopted in many countries recommend that women whose family history of breast cancer places them at a risk ≥ 1.7 times that of the age-matched general population, should be considered for inclusion in special surveillance programmes. However validation of risk assessment models has been called for as a matter of urgency. The databases of the four Scottish Familial Breast Cancer clinics and the Scottish Cancer Registry have been searched to identify breast cancers occurring among 1,125 women aged 40–56, with family histories placing them below the "moderate" level of genetic risk. The observed incidence over 6 years was compared with age-specific data for the Scottish population. Our findings confirm that when there are two affected relatives (one first degree) the relative risk (RR) exceeds 1.7 regardless of their ages at diagnosis. When only one (first degree) relative was affected at any age from 40 to 55, the RR does not reach 1.7 if that relative was a mother but exceeds it if the relative was a sister. The probable explanation is that sisters are more likely than mother/daughter pairs to share homozygosity for a risk allele. Surveillance programmes might therefore accommodate sisters of women affected before age 55. Evidence that "low penetrance" alleles contributing to breast cancer risk may be recessive should be taken into account in strategies for identifying them.

### Mortality in a cohort of 3.1 million children, adolescents and young adults [^cdd90f34]. Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health (2020). Medium credibility.

Figure 5
Proportion of all deaths occurring outside of a hospital setting, among Canadian children, adolescents and young adults aged 1–24 years. Shown on the Y-axis are age-specific proportions and 95% CIs for deaths occurring outside of hospital, and below the X-axis are rate ratios for mortality comparing males vs females within each age group.

As the number of preceding liveborn siblings increased, so did a child's overall risk of dying from any cause (table 4, upper). These HRs were more pronounced for deaths due to injury (table 4, lower) than from non-injury causes (table 4, middle).

Table 4
Death of a child between ages 1 and 24 years in relation to the number of liveborn siblings preceding the birth of the current child

In the 1:1 matched sibling analysis, there were 980 deaths among 565 588 sisters (13.3 per 100 000 person-years) and 1485 deaths among matched brothers (20.2 per 100 000 person-years) — an unadjusted HR of 1.52 (95% CI 1.40 to 1.65) and an adjusted HR of 1.46 (95% CI 1.35 to 1.58).

### Practice resource-focused revision: standardized pedigree nomenclature update centered on sex and gender inclusivity: a practice resource of the National Society of Genetic Counselors [^2b7f2db4]. Journal of Genetic Counseling (2022). High credibility.

Standardized pedigree nomenclature — relationship and descent line conventions specify that siblings should be listed from left to right in birth order (oldest to youngest), a break in a relationship line indicates the relationship no longer exists, multiple previous partners do not need to be shown if they do not affect genetic assessment, and if degree of relationship is not obvious from the pedigree, it should be stated (e.g., third cousins) above the relationship line.

### Teenage pregnancy: the impact of maternal adolescent childbearing and older sister's teenage pregnancy on a younger sister [^db49bf6b]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2016). Low credibility.

Data

The Manitoba Population Health Research Data Repository contains province-wide, routinely collected individual data over time (going back to 1970 in some files), across space (with residential location documented using six digit postal codes), for each family (with changes in family structure recorded every 6 months) and for each resident. Health variables are measured continuously from physician claims and hospital abstracts (as long as an individual remains in Manitoba).

A research registry identifies every provincial resident, with information on births, arrival and departure dates, and deaths created from the provincial health registry and coordinated with Vital Statistics files. Given approximately 16,000 births annually, follow-up (about 74% over 20 years) is comparable to that in the largest cohort studies based on primary data. Previous research using similar data shows the results are not biased by individuals leaving the province or dying. Information on data linkage, confidentiality/privacy, and validity of the datasets used have been described elsewhere. Children are linked to mothers using hospital birth record information; the mother was noted in essentially all cases. Sisters were defined as having the same biological mother.

The cohort consists of women who were born in Manitoba between April 1, 1979 and March 31, 1994, stayed in the province until at least their 20 th birthday, had at least one older sister, and had no missing values on key variables. In this study, teenage pregnancies are defined as those between the ages of 14 and 19; pregnancies prior to age 14 were excluded due to low numbers and for comparability to other studies. For this reason, families in which at least one sister had a pregnancy before age 14 were removed (34 families). To address threats of independence, when a family had more than one younger sister (more than two daughters), one younger sister was randomly selected. Figure 1 diagrams the selection trajectory for the 17,115 individuals selected — boxes in bold indicate the included cohort. At age 14, just over 85% of girls in this cohort were living in the same postal code as at least one older sister.

### Is the recent increase in cervical cancer in women aged 20-24years in england a cause for concern? [^2116c00a]. Preventive Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

An increase in stage IA and IB (but no increase in stage II +) CxCa was seen at age 27 yrs in 2009 ("Jade Goody effect"), Table 3. Although rates of stage II or worse CxCa at age 27 yrs have decreased with calendar time, cohorts first invited at age 25.0 yrs had an increase in stage II or worse incidence rates of 4.5 per 100,000 women (95% CI: 1.4 to 7.7, p = 0.005).

At age 28–29 yrs a significant increase in rates of stage IA CxCa associated both with the Jade Goody effect and first inviting women at age 25.0 yrs (so that the second invitation would be at age 28.0) was observed. An increase in rates of stage IB CxCa at age 28 yrs was associated with inviting women at age 25.0 yrs. At age 29 yrs there was an increase in stage II or worse cancer associated with the Jade Goody effect (2.5, 95% CI: 0.2 to 4.8 per 100,000).

In summary, the majority of the increase in CxCa since 2006 is due to an increase in stage IA and IB cancers associated with the change in screening policy whereby women are invited for screening at age 25.0 yrs (or 24.5 yrs) instead of from age 20 yrs. An increase in rates of stage II or worse CxCa associated with inviting women for screening at age 25.0 yrs was only observed among those aged 27 yrs and could be an artefact of multiple statistical testing, particularly given that rates of stage II + cancer decreased at age 26. Results among those with known FIGO stage (Supplementary Table 1) support these findings.

3.4 Comparison of cumulative risk of cervical cancer pre and post change in age at invitation

The cumulative number of cancers diagnosed at ages 24.5–27.0 yrs by birth cohort showed that inviting women at age 25.0 or 24.5 yrs (cohorts born from 1986 onwards) resulted in an average increase of 26 additional cancers per 100,000 women (over 3 years) of which 8 per 100,000 were stage IB and none were stage II or worse.

### High maternal mortality in jigawa state, Northern Nigeria estimated using the sisterhood method [^4773c3a9]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2017). Low credibility.

Results

A total of 7,069 respondents completed the survey. The average age of respondents was 27.9 years (SD = 8.5) (Table 1). The majority of respondents had no formal schooling (64.8%), and only 9.6% were literate. Almost all respondents were Muslim (99.9%), and 30.5% reported they were in polygamous households. Respondents reported on average 4.0 births (SD = 3.1).

Table 1
Characteristics of respondents in study sample

The 7,069 respondents reported 10,957 maternal sisters who survived past the age of 15 years of which 1,026 (9.4%) were reported dead. Of the 1,026 deaths, 300 (29.2%) occurred during pregnancy, childbirth or within 42 days after delivery. Table 2 shows the sisters' vital status by 5-year age groups and the LTR of maternal death for the entire cohort. The total lifetime risk of maternal death was 6.6% or 1 in 15. Using a TFR of 6.7 for Jigawa State, the estimated MMR for the study areas was 1,012 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births (95% CI: 898–1,126). The approximate time reference for the MMR estimate was the year 2001 corresponding to 11.0 years before the interviews.

### Life review in advanced age: qualitative research on the 'start in life' of 90-year-olds in the lothian birth cohort 1921 [^2c2ecdeb]. BMC Geriatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Two years later when I was 12 my father aged 39 died. My grandfather had to come back into the business. The 30s depression was on & the business collapsed. My mother was very capable but with my infant brother to be looked after she had to find employment which she could do from home. Life was financially very difficult for some years".

John told us how his father's death and his mother's later illness had a huge impact on his schooling and early career:

"I did not realize how I was affected by grief but woke up around fourteen with the class steeped in French & Latin & I was lost, but had grasped more than I realised. When I was sixteen Mother had serious illness & I simply left school. Did not sit Highers but got job in an office. As a junior clerk two years later I was very dissatisfied but contracted T.B. & spent 3 years 9 months in hospital. Chance meeting with old B [oys'] B [rigade] officer resulted in work in his office. He was a solicitor and he suggested I qualify. University (Glasgow) entrance exam. English history French & Latin passed two years later–then aged 27.

John went on to become a successful solicitor. It was a difficult start, he says, but he is proud of his own efforts.

These brief stories demonstrate how rich contextual information was gained from some participant accounts of their Scottish childhoods, the narratives giving a different perspective than the thematic analysis presented in the next section.

Start in life themes

Participants describing schooling and family support during their growing years on the whole reminisced with warmth. Some also told of hardship, loss and other difficulties jeopardising a good start to their lives, but they often told how negative impacts from these situations were ameliorated by family support. The following sections present a thematic analysis of 'start in life' material on schooling and family support. Key themes have been italicised and written extracts identified as from male (M) or female (F). Although some responses were more detailed than others, and these have often been utilised in illustrative quotations, the analysis process has accurately weighted positive and negative evaluations.

### Familial risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma by sex, relationship, age at diagnosis and histology: a joint study from five nordic countries [^01895bab]. Leukemia (2016). Low credibility.

We aimed to estimate stratified absolute (cumulative) and relative (standardized incidence ratios; SIRs) risks of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) in relatives of NHL patients. A cohort of 169830 first-degree relatives of 45406 NHL patients who were diagnosed between 1955 and 2010 in five European countries was followed for cancer incidence. The lifetime (0–79 year) cumulative risk of NHL in siblings of a patient with NHL was 1.6%, which represents a 1.6-fold increased risk (SIR = 1.6, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.2–1.9) over the general population risk. NHL risk among parent-offspring pairs was increased up to 1.4-fold (95% CI = 1.3–1.5; lifetime risk 1.4%). The lifetime risk was higher when NHL was diagnosed in a sister (2.5% in her brothers and 1.9% in her sisters) or a father (1.7% in his son). When there were ⩾2 NHL patients diagnosed in a family, the lifetime NHL risk for relatives was 2.1%. Depending on sex and age at diagnosis, twins had a 3.1–12.9% lifetime risk of NHL. Family history of most of the histological subtypes of NHL increased the risk of concordant and some discordant subtypes. Familial risk did not significantly change by age at diagnosis of NHL in relatives. Familial risk of NHL was not limited to early onset cases.

### An analysis of the accuracy of retrospective birth location recall using sibling data [^b7877358]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

We next quantify the relationship between the siblings' age gap and the discordance of their reported birth location further using a linear regression. In addition to the estimated discordance for twins (i.e. those with an age gap of zero; the constant), the top panel of Table 1 shows that each additional year between the birth of two siblings increases the probability of reporting different coordinates by approximately 1 percentage point. While this estimate is very similar across the different specifications, it does decrease with distance, indicating that the probability of a long-distance move is lower than the probability of any move.

Table 1
Differences in siblings' birth location and their age gap

The sample is restricted to the first sibling pair observed in each family. 95% confidence intervals based on heteroskedasticity robust standard errors are shown in brackets. Standard errors forwere computed using the delta method. In two-sided significance tests, all regression coefficients and derived probabilities are statistically different from zero with p < 10 −13.

Finally, we investigate potential non-linearities in the relationship between the discordance of birth location and the siblings' age gap. Supplementary Table 1 shows that adding a quadratic term only marginally changes the estimated probabilities, suggesting that the linear specification in Table 1 is appropriate.

Derived probabilities of household moves and measurement error

The regression estimates in the top panel of Table 1 can be used to derive the estimated annual probabilities of a household move, which we define as(equivalent to the slope coefficient on the sibling age gap in the top panel), as well as the probability of measurement error in the reporting of an individual's birth locations, denoted by(derived using Equation (4) in the 'Methods' section). These derived probabilities are shown in the bottom panel of Table 1. These derivations rely on a number of simplifying assumptions: (1) if siblings report the same birth location, we assume this is the true birth location, (2) biological siblings have grown up in the same household, (3) the move probability increases linearly with the age gap between the two siblings and (4) errors in the birth location occur randomly with the same probability across all participants, are independent within sibling pairs and independent of the sibling age gap. A more detailed discussion of these assumptions can be found in the 'Methods' section.

### High maternal mortality in rural south-west Ethiopia: estimate by using the sisterhood method [^d7cc5153]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2012). Low credibility.

Results

We interviewed 8870 people of the 9000 sample (98.5% response rate), and included 96% (8503/ 8870) of respondents in the analysis. The missing information from the excluded 4% (367 people) of the respondents was mainly because of misclassification of age (outside the 15–49 year age range) and missing information regarding the gender of the respondents. There were no maternal deaths reported by those excluded from the analysis.

Of the 8503 respondents in the analysis, 5262 (62%) were men and 3241 (38%) were women. The mean age of the respondents was 26.4 (SD = 8.7) years (range, 15–49 years). The most frequently reported age of the respondents was 30 years, followed by 20 and 18 years (Figure 1).

Figure 1
Age distribution of men and women respondents for Bonke sisterhood study 2011 versus Gamo Gofa zone population of the same age group in 2007 Ethiopian National Census.

The 8503 respondents reported 22,473 sisters born to the same mother who survived to the reproductive age. The average number of adult sisters per respondent was 2.6. Of the 22,473 sisters who survived to reproductive age, 2,552 (11.35%) had died. Among the sisters who had died, 32% (819/2552) were pregnancy-related deaths.

The lifetime risk of death from maternal causes was 0.102 (95% CI, 0.096–0.108) or 10.2% (Table 1). Using a TFR of 6.4 for south Ethiopia, we calculated a MMR of 1667 (95% CI, 1564–1769) per 100,000 live births for 1998.

Additional Cross-Cohort, Sex, and Race and Ethnicity Comparisons

We examined the cross-cohort comparative observations in more quantitative detail using a multivariable regression model that stratified the 3 outcomes; controlled for family members' age, sex, race and ethnicity, and duration of observation; and accounted for family-level clustering of observations (Table 3). The cardiac cohort had the smallest increase among case family members in the composite outcome rate at 29% (IRR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.15–1.36), followed by the prematurity cohort at 39% (IRR, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.29–1.51), whereas the neurologic cohort had the greatest increase at 76% (IRR, 1.76; 95% CI, 1.68–1.84), followed by the oncologic cohort at 62% (IRR, 1.62; 95% CI, 1.53–1.73).

Abbreviation: IRR, incident rate ratio.

Although the case family mothers, fathers, sisters, and brothers had similar degrees of increase in outcome rates compared with their control family counterparts, in all 4 cohorts, case mothers had composite outcome rates that were 44% greater than those for case fathers (IRR, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.39–1.49), whereas case sisters' composite outcome rates were 11% higher than those for case brothers (IRR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.05–1.17).

The models adjusted for differences observed in the distribution of the 5 different categories of race and ethnicity among case and control families. In the overall outcomes model including all 4 cohorts, compared with family members classified as White, family members classified as Black had similar composite outcome rates (IRR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.92–1.05); those classified as Hispanic had lower rates (IRR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.85–0.95), as did those classified as other race and ethnicity or who had missing data on race and ethnicity (IRR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.84–0.95). Those classified as Asian had the lowest rates (IRR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.62–0.71).

### An analysis of the accuracy of retrospective birth location recall using sibling data [^50ff1998]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Deriving probabilities of household moves and measurement error

We use the regression estimates of Equation (1) to derive the probability of a household move during childhood as well as the probability of measurement error in the location of birth. To derive these probabilities, we make the following assumptions:

Assumption 1

If both siblings in a sibling pair report the same birth location, we assume this is the true birth location for both.

Assumption 1 recognises that we cannot identify misreporting of birth locations if both siblings report the same incorrect birth locations. Ignoring these unlikely cases will downward bias the derived error probability. We furthermore cannot identify household moves in cases where the siblings incorrectly report the same birth location.

Assumption 2

We assume that biological siblings grew up in the same household.

Assumption 2 ignores adoptions shortly after birth and other events that may result in biological siblings growing up in different households. However, the frequency of such events in the UK during 1940–70 was likely low, and thus any resulting upward bias in the derived error probability will be small.

Assumption 3

We assume that the probability of a move between the birth of two siblings is a linear function of the age gap between them.

We empirically test Assumption 3 in Supplementary Results 1 by allowing for non-linearities in the relationship between the sibling age gap and the probability of house moves. While we find minor non-linearities, these only affect the derived error probabilities to a small degree.

Assumption 4

We assume that measurement error occurs randomly with the same probability for any participant and that these errors are independent within sibling pairs and independent of the age gap between siblings.

Assumption 4 is unlikely to hold in reality. Indeed, we show in Supplementary Results 2 that certain participant characteristics affect the probability of house moves and measurement errors. It is furthermore likely that error occurrence is positively correlated among siblings, but our data does not allow us to quantify this. Ignoring such a positive within-sibling correlation will downward bias the derived error probability. However, simulations show that a very strong sibling correlation is required to create substantial bias.

Under the above assumptions, the probability of a difference in the reported birth location between two siblings can be written as:where q denotes the annual probability of a household moving to a different location. The probability of an error in the birth location of either sibling can be written as:We use this to derive the probability p of an error in the birth location of any respondent, defined as:

### Accounting for age of onset and family history improves power in genome-wide association studies [^24c9bfe7]. American Journal of Human Genetics (2022). Medium credibility.

A family consisted of one offspring, two parents, and zero to two siblings. The age of the cases was set to the age of onset. The age of onset was assigned by taking the inverse of the logistic function on the full liability's quantile under the standard normal distribution. Individuals with an age lower than their age of onset would normally be considered controls because they had not yet had the time to develop the disorder. However, setting high liability individuals to controls because age of onset was later than age was decided against to properly fix the number of cases to the prevalence in the simulated data. For controls, the offspring's age was uniformly distributed between 10 and 60. The parents' age was set to the age of the child plus a uniform draw between 20 and 35, allowing for up to 95 year olds. The threshold was assigned with the logistic function with the age and sex as inputs. For simplicity, birth year was not modeled. Finally, we simulated sample ascertainment by downsampling controls such that cases and controls had equal proportions (50% each). For 5% prevalence, this resulted in a sample size of 10,000 and 20,000 individuals when using a prevalence of 10%.

### New observations on maternal age effect on germline de novo mutations [^010276b6]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

We next sought to identify if there is any difference in the increase in mutation rate per year in younger and older parents by splitting the data in half using either the median father's age (32.9 years) or the median mother's age (31.3 years) and fit MLRs on both parents ages on the total number of DNMs (Supplementary Table 2). Interestingly, estimates of the slope for father's age are quite similar in older (> median father's age) and younger (< median father's age) fathers (0.67 vs 0.71, 95% CI: 0.47, 0.87 vs 0.43, 0.99). On the other hand, the estimate of the slope in older mothers is almost double of that in the younger mothers (0.61 vs 0.31, 95% CI: 0.28, 0.94 vs 0.04, 0.58), after accounting for the father's age. This observation suggests that while the germline mutation rate increases linearly with father's age, it accelerates in older mothers.

The Task Force discussed changing the 'relationship line' connecting spouses or partners from a solid to a dotted line, but it was decided that such a change is largely unnecessary and would be disruptive both to practicing clinicians and electronic medical records and pedigree software; in consanguineous unions, a solid double line denotes a genetic relationship.

### Pregnancy at age 35 years or older: ACOG obstetric care consensus no. 11 [^89c101de]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2022). High credibility.

Low-dose aspirin prophylaxis — pregnant individuals aged 35 years or older at risk for preeclampsia: We recommend daily low-dose aspirin for the reduction of preeclampsia for pregnant individuals aged 35 years or older in the setting of at least 1 other moderate risk factor (GRADE 1B). ACOG, SMFM, and the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommend initiating low-dose aspirin therapy (81 mg/d), ideally between 12 and 16 weeks of gestation, continued daily until delivery in individuals at high risk for preeclampsia, and the USPSTF determined that age of 35 years or older is a moderate risk factor; therefore, individuals aged 35 years or older with at least 1 high-risk factor or at least 1 additional moderate-risk factor qualify for low-dose aspirin therapy. Other moderate-risk factors include nulliparity, obesity (ie, BMI > 30), family history of preeclampsia (ie, mother or sister), Black race (as a proxy for underlying racism), lower income, personal history factors (eg, low birthweight or small for gestational age neonates, previous adverse pregnancy outcome, > 19-year pregnancy interval), and in vitro fertilization, while high-risk factors include history of preeclampsia (especially when accompanied by an adverse outcome), multifetal gestation, chronic hypertension, pregestational type 1 or 2 diabetes mellitus, kidney disease, autoimmune disease (ie, systemic lupus erythematosus, antiphospholipid syndrome), and combinations of multiple moderate-risk factors. Additionally, low-dose aspirin can also be considered if the patient has only one or more of the following moderate-risk factors, regardless of age: Black race (as a proxy for underlying racism) or lower income. In a systematic review, the USPSTF found evidence of a reduction in risk with low-dose aspirin prophylaxis among individuals at increased risk for preeclampsia for preeclampsia (pooled RR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.75–0.95; 16 studies; I2 50%), preterm birth (pooled RR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.67–0.95; 13 studies; I2 54%), small for gestational age neonates or fetal growth restriction (RR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.68–0.99; 16 studies; I2 41.0%), and perinatal mortality (pooled RR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.66–0.96; 11 studies; I2 50%).

### Familial risks, early-onset breast cancer, and BRCA1 and BRCA2 germline mutations [^aff9baee]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Having a family history of breast cancer, particularly if it involves early-onset disease, is a risk factor for breast cancer, but little is known about specific causes of this association. Consequently, we studied mothers, sisters, and aunts of an age-stratified sample of 1567 unselected case patients diagnosed with breast cancer before age 60 years, recruited to a population-based, case-control-family study, in which case patients, control subjects, and their relatives were administered the same questionnaire.

Methods

Extensive BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation testing was carried out for 788 case patients diagnosed before age 40 years, including manual sequencing of DNA from 72 patients with two or more affected relatives. Standardized morbidity ratios, age-specific cumulative risks, and hazard ratios were calculated for groupings of relatives.

Results

Cumulative risks of breast cancer to age 50 years in the sisters, mothers, and aunts of the case patients, respectively, were 6, 3, and 2 times the population risk if the case patient was younger than age 40 years at diagnosis but were considerably lower if the case patient was older at diagnosis. When relatives of the case patients with a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation were excluded, these risks fell by, at most, 20%. Sisters and aunts, but not mothers, who had an additional first-degree relative with breast cancer were at increased risk, and the risk was greater when that relative was younger at diagnosis. Hazard ratios were 10.7 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 4.2 to 26.8) for sisters and 4.2 (95% CI = 2.2 to 8.1) for aunts, if the relative was aged 40 years at diagnosis. Fewer than one-third of the excess of breast cancers in relatives of case patients diagnosed before age 40 years that are attributed to familial factors are BRCA1- or BRCA2-related.

Conclusion

Mutations in genes other than BRCA1 and BRCA2 may be associated with a high risk of breast cancer, especially in young women.

### An analysis of the accuracy of retrospective birth location recall using sibling data [^715a6bb9]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Additionally, we restrict the sample to the oldest two siblings observed in each family (1095 participants dropped). Our final sample comprises 36,958 siblings from 18,479 families. Supplementary Table 11 presents some descriptive statistics on our sibling sample, showing that the age gap between siblings varies between 0 and 27 years, with a mean of 4.5 years. The data comprises 227 pairs of twins, and 57.7% of the sibling sample are female. On average, siblings report being born 22 km apart, though this is highly skewed, ranging from 0 to 1060 km. The sibling sample is relatively similar in individual and district characteristics compared to the full UKB sample (see Supplementary Table 12), with 63–66% having an upper secondary qualification and 84–86% being born in an urban or municipal district.

Polygenic indices

We explore the heterogeneity of our results with respect to the siblings' genetic predisposition for educational attainment. For this purpose, we use the PGI for education provided in the PGI repositoryto split the sample into quartiles and below-/above-median sub-samples. Specifically, we use the single-trait PGI provided in the repository for (what they call) the first partition of the UKB which includes all siblings. This PGI is based on a discovery sample of N = 984,323 which includes the other two partitions of the UKB as well as other datasets such as 23andMe, AddHealth and HRS. In line with the current genetics literature, we restrict our sample in estimations involving PGIs to those of European ancestry. Thus the sample size reduces from 18,479 sibling pairs in our main estimations to 18,048 sibling pairs in estimations with the PGI. In this sample, the PGI for educational attainment has an incremental R 2 of 10.9%.

### High maternal mortality in rural south-west Ethiopia: estimate by using the sisterhood method [^0ce6fc85]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2012). Low credibility.

Data analysis

SPSS 16 (SPSS, Inc. Chicago, IL, USA) was used for data entry and analysis. We used an inflation adjustment to determine the final number of surviving adult sisters for the younger respondents (15–24 years of age. This was done by multiplying the number of respondents in the young age groups by the average number of sisters among the older respondents (25–49 years of age), which was 2.65 in this data. For example, 2.65* 2443 = 6471 adjusted sisters for the 15–19 year old respondents. This factor was used with the assumption that the younger respondents had sisters who had yet to reach reproductive age.

Using standard adjustment factors, we adjusted for the expected proportion of sisters that would have finished their reproductive age for respondents in each age category. Thus, 90% of the sisters of respondents 45–49 years of age are expected to have passed through their reproductive life, but only 10.7% of the sisters of 15–19 year old respondents. The adjustment was implemented so as to determine the number of sister units exposed to maternal death.

This retrospective cohort analysis provided 8,068 sister units exposed to the risk of maternal death that served as the denominator for calculating the lifetime risk of maternal death.

The lifetime risk (Q) of maternal death was calculated by Q = r/ β, where r is the number of maternal deaths and β is the sister units exposed to the risk of maternal death. We calculated the MMR as MMR = 1-(P) 1/TFR, where P is the probability of surviving, which equals (1-Q), and TFR is the total fertility rate.

Ethics approval

This study was approved by the Ethical Review Committee for Health Research of the Southern Nations Nationalities and the Peoples' Regional State (SNNPRS) Health Bureau in Ethiopia, and the Regional Committee for Medical and Health Research Ethics of North Norway (REK Nord). We obtained informed oral consent from all of the respondents.

### Prognostic information of a previously diagnosed sister is an independent prognosticator for a newly diagnosed sister with breast cancer [^f205f8b8]. Annals of Oncology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Breast cancer survival has been shown to be associated among relatives. In this study, we used a population-based cohort of Swedish sisters, both diagnosed with breast cancer, to determine whether prognostic information of a previously diagnosed sibling is useful for the clinical management of a newly diagnosed sibling.

Patients and Methods

The population-based cohort included all sister pairs, 1617 sisters, diagnosed with breast cancer in Sweden, from 1 January 1992, through 31 December 2006, with complete follow-up. All information was collected manually from original pathology reports and patient records. The Kappa statistic was used to measure the agreement of primary tumor characteristics between the sisters. We modeled the breast cancer-specific survival using multivariate (Cox) proportional hazard analyses in two steps categorizing the older sister's survival.

Results

Estrogen receptor status was the only tumor characteristic significantly associated between the sisters [κ 0.18 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.089–0.27)]. Younger sisters with poor older sister survival showed significantly worse survival compared with patients with good older sister survival (log rank, P = 0.017). A twofold increased hazard ratio (HR) for death from breast cancer was found in younger sisters with poor older sister survival compared with patients with good sister survival [HR 2.56 (95% CI 1.16–5.65)], adjusting for age and calendar period of diagnosis, socioeconomic factors, number of children and hospital of primary tumor diagnosis. When further adjusting for primary tumor characteristics and adjuvant therapy, the risk for death from breast cancer in younger sisters with poor older sister survival became more pronounced [HR 3.35 (1.34–8.34)].

Conclusions

Our findings derived from a population-based cohort of Swedish sister pairs suggest that breast cancer-specific survival is inherited independent of tumor characteristics and treatment in the sibling later diagnosed with the disease. Prognostic information of a previously diagnosed sibling with breast cancer could be important in the clinical management.

With regard to the association of these epigenetic patterns to FXTAS, the results were more varied, lacking direct association. In four of the seven sister pairs (pairs 2–5), the age of onset of neurological signs was earlier in the sister with the lower AR of the normal allele (Table 1). In the first of the three exceptions (pair 1), the CGG repeat size was higher in the sister with earlier age of onset and the ARs between the two were similar. In pair 6, age of onset was very close despite varying AR. Pair 7 is not yet affected, but the sisters were younger than 40. Many of the women did not have available neuroimaging, which was not required or collected in the study, and a more definitive diagnosis of FXTAS could not be made. Even though the sample size in this cohort was too small to determine whether there was an association between FXTAS and AR, the use of mPCR provided ARs, CGG repeat length, and additional layers of information consistent with the goals of understanding links between genotype and phenotype.

### Familial breast cancer: collaborative reanalysis of individual data from 52 epidemiological studies including 58, 209 women with breast cancer and 101, 986 women without the disease [^e892eb59]. Lancet (2001). Excellent credibility.

Background

Women with a family history of breast cancer are at increased risk of the disease, but no study has been large enough to characterise reliably how, over women's lives, this risk is influenced by particular familial patterns of breast cancer. This report, on the relevance of breast cancer in first-degree relatives, is based on combined data from 52 epidemiological studies.

Methods

Individual data on breast cancer in first-degree relatives (mothers, sisters, and daughters) of 58209 women with breast cancer and of 101986 controls were collected, checked, and analysed centrally. Risk ratios for breast cancer were calculated by conditional logistic regression, stratified by study, age, menopausal status, number of sisters, parity, and age when the first child was born. Breast-cancer incidence and mortality rates for particular family histories were calculated by applying age-specific risk ratios to breast-cancer rates typical for more-developed countries.

Findings

Altogether 7496 (12.9%) women with breast cancer and 7438 (7.3%) controls reported that one or more first-degree relatives had a history of breast cancer: 12% of women with breast cancer had one affected relative and 1% had two or more. Risk ratios for breast cancer increased with increasing numbers of affected first-degree relatives: compared with women who had no affected relative, the ratios were 1.80 (99% CI 1.69–1.91), 2.93 (2.36–3.64), and 3.90 (2.03–7.49), respectively, for one, two, and three or more affected first-degree relatives (p < 0.0001 each). The risk ratios were greatest at young ages, and for women of a given age, were greater the younger the relative was when diagnosed. The results did not differ substantially between women reporting an affected mother (9104) or sister (6386). Other factors, such as childbearing history, did not significantly alter the risk ratios associated with a family history of breast cancer. For women in more-developed countries with zero, one, or two affected first-degree relatives, the estimated cumulative incidence of breast cancer up to age 50 was 1.7%, 3.7%, and 8.0%, respectively; corresponding estimates for incidence up to age 80 were 7.8%, 13.3%, and 21.1%. Corresponding estimates for death from breast cancer up to age 80 were 2.3%, 4.2%, and 7.6%. The age when the relative was diagnosed had only a moderate effect on these estimates.

Interpretation

Eight out of nine women who develop breast cancer do not have an affected mother, sister, or daughter. Although women who have first-degree relatives with a history of breast cancer are at increased risk of the disease, most will never develop breast cancer, and most who do will be aged over 50 when their cancer is diagnosed. In countries where breast cancer is common, the lifetime excess incidence of breast cancer is 5.5% for women with one affected first-degree relative and 13.3% for women with two.

### All alcohol exposure counts-testing parental, older sibling, best friend and peer exposure on young adolescent drinking in a seven-wave longitudinal study [^77755629]. Addiction (2023). Medium credibility.

Alcohol use in the last 6 months

For adolescents who indicated consuming alcohol at any point in their life‐time, a follow‐up question was asked: 'How long ago did you consume alcohol?'. Response options were 'never', 'less than 1 month ago', 'about 6 months ago' and 'more than 6 months ago'. Those who indicated that they consumed alcohol no more than 6 months ago were coded as a recent drinker (1) and those reporting no life‐time alcohol use or no alcohol use in the past 6 months were coded as a non‐drinker at that time‐point (0).

Alcohol use in the last 4 weeks

Adolescents were asked: 'In the past four weeks, how often did you drink alcohol?'. Response options were: 'I never drank alcohol', '1 to 3 days per month', '1 to 2 days per week', '3 to 4 days per week', '5 to 6 days per week' and 'every day'. Because of skewed distribution and the low prevalence of frequent drinking in this young sample, this variable was dichotomized to 0 ('I did not drink last month') and 1 ('I drank at least once last month').

Binge drinking in the last 4 weeks

Adolescents were asked: 'In the past 4 weeks, how often did you drink five glasses or more on one occasion?'. The response options were the same as the alcohol use in the past 4 weeks variable, and this variable was also dichotomized to 0 ('no binge drinking in the last 4 weeks') and 1 ('binge drinking in the last 4 weeks').

Exposure to parental alcohol use

For mothers and fathers separately, adolescents were asked: 'How often have you seen your mother/father drink alcohol in the following situations?'. Adolescents reported the frequency of parental drinking in nine family‐specific situations deemed most common for alcohol use, such as a family barbecue or a birthday party. Responses were recorded on a 5‐point Likert scale ranging from 0 ('never') to 4 ('always'). Exposure from fathers and mothers were averaged to calculate a mean exposure score and were correlated r = 0.541, P < 0.001.

The baseline survey was conducted between December 2011 and May 2012. Data were collected from a total of 7,069 women of reproductive age using a structured questionnaire translated to Hausa, the local language, focused on maternal and child health. Female, Hausa speaking interviewers from the study areas collected data using smart phones programed with Open Data Kit electronic data collection software. The questionnaire also included the four standard indirect Sisterhood Method questions in order to estimate MMR in the state. The specific questions included were: 1) How many sisters (born to the same mother) have you ever had who reached the age of 15 (including those who are now dead)?, 2) How many of these sisters are alive now?, 3) How many of these sisters are dead?, 4) How many of the dead sisters died during pregnancy, labor or within 42 days after delivery?. Interviewers checked that the sum of questions two and three was equal to the total in question one.

Data analysis

Data were analyzed using Stata 13.1 (Stata Corp, College Station, TX). For each 5-year age group, the number of sisters exposed to the risk of maternal death and the duration of their exposure was calculated by multiplying the number of sisters by an age-specific adjustment factor. The lifetime risk of maternal death (LTR) was calculated by dividing the total number of maternal deaths by the estimated total number of sisters exposed. An average estimate of the total fertility rate (TFR) in Jigawa state of 6.7 was obtained from the 2011 Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey. The formula used to calculate MMR from the LTR was: MMR = 100,000 × (1- [1-LTR] (1/TFR)). Ninety-five percent confidence intervals for MMR were calculated using the method of Hanley et al. The time period to which the estimate refers was calculated through the following equation: T = Σ (T(i)*B(i))/ΣB(i), where T = the point time location of the global estimate, T(i) = the time location of the estimate for each age group and B(i) = the exposing units of each age group.

Ethics

Verbal informed consent was obtained from all respondents. Ethical approval was obtained from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and the Jigawa State Operations Research Advisory Committee (ORAC). The trial is registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT01487707).

### Expert panel on integrated guidelines for cardiovascular health and risk reduction in children and adolescents: summary report [^06fce669]. Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

Evidence-based recommendations for use of family history in cardiovascular health promotion — birth–17 y specify to take detailed family history (FHx) of cardiovascular disease (CVD) at the initial encounter and/or at 3y, 9-11y & 18y (Grade B, Recommend), to evaluate the patient for other cardiovascular (CV) risk factors if (+) FHx is identified, including dyslipidemia, hypertension, diabetes, obesity, history of smoking, and sedentary lifestyle (Grade B, Recommend), to evaluate the family, especially parents, for CV risk factors if (+) FHx and/or CV risk factors are identified (Grade B, Recommend), to update FHx at each non-urgent health encounter (Grade D, Recommend), and to use FHx to stratify risk for CVD risk as risk profile evolves (Grade D, Recommend). Supportive actions are to educate parents about the importance of FHx in estimating future health risks for all family members, and the FHx asterisk specifies: parent, grandparent, aunt, uncle, or sibling with heart attack, treated angina, CABG/stent/angioplasty, stroke, or sudden cardiac death at < 55 y in males, < 65 y in females; supportive actions are not graded.

### Assessment of adult women with ovarian masses and treatment of epithelial ovarian cancer: ASCO resource-stratified guideline [^18becec0]. JCO Global Oncology (2021). High credibility.

Assessing heritable risk (Recommendation 1.3) — During the diagnosis for women with ovarian masses, the guideline stresses that the most important risk-related intervention is taking family history and related counseling, in all settings, and family history includes the patient's age, cancer history, childbearing status and preferences, and that of close relatives (especially first- and second-degree relatives). First-degree relatives include a patient's mother, father, sister, brother, daughter, or son; second-degree relatives are the first-degree relative(s) of a patient's first-degree relatives (grandparents, grandchildren, parent(s)'s siblings and their children, and half-siblings). In basic-resource settings, clinicians evaluating women for ovarian masses in basic-resource settings should obtain a comprehensive family cancer history, and families of women with a diagnosis of ovarian cancer seeking genetic counseling should be referred to a higher-level center with clinicians trained in cancer risk management. In limited-resource and enhanced-resource settings, clinicians should be mindful that to offer genetic testing, actionable next steps should be available, for example, follow-up counseling and genetic marker–based treatment(s), and guidelines such as SIGN state with a low level of evidence that screening for ovarian cancer in high-risk groups without confirmed diagnosis of personal or family history of cancer should only be offered in the context of a research study (Source: informal consensus on the basis of Expert Panel opinion).

### Maternal weight gain in excess of pregnancy guidelines is related to daughters being overweight 40 years later [^dfde93db]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Exceeding the Institute of Medicine guidelines for pregnancy weight gain increases childhood and adolescent obesity. However, it is unknown if these effects extend to midlife.

Objective

We sought to determine if exceeding the Institute of Medicine guidelines for pregnancy weight gain increases risk of overweight/obesity in daughters 40 years later.

Study Design

This cohort study is based on adult offspring in the Child Health and Development Studies and the Collaborative Perinatal Project pregnancy cohorts originally enrolled in the 1960s. In 2005 through 2008, 1035 daughters in their 40s were recruited to the Early Determinants of Mammographic Density study. We classified maternal pregnancy weight gain as greater than vs less than or equal to the 2009 clinical guidelines. We used logistic regression to compare the odds ratios of daughters being overweight/obese (body mass index [BMI] ≥ 25) at a mean age of 44 years between mothers who did not gain or gained more than pregnancy weight gain guidelines, accounting for maternal prepregnant BMI, and daughter body size at birth and childhood. We also examined potential family related confounding through a comparison of sisters using generalized estimating equations, clustered on sibling units and adjusted for maternal age and race.

Results

Mothers who exceeded guidelines for weight gain in pregnancy were more likely to have daughters who were overweight/obese in their 40s (odds ratio [OR], 3.4; 95% confidence interval {CI}, 2.0–5.7). This magnitude of association translates to a relative risk (RR) increase of 50% (RR = 1.5; 95% CI, 1.3–1.6). The association was of the same magnitude when examining only the siblings whose mother exceeded guidelines in 1 pregnancy and did not exceed the guidelines in the other pregnancy. The association was stronger with increasing maternal prepregnancy BMI (P trend < .001). Compared to mothers with BMI < 25 who did not exceed guidelines, the relative risks (RR) for having an overweight/obese adult daughter were 1.3 (95% CI, 1.1–1.7), 1.7 (95% CI, 1.4–2.1) and 1.8 (95% CI, 1.5–2.1), respectively, if mothers exceeded guidelines and their prepregnancy BMI was < 25, overweight (BMI 25- < 30), or obese (BMI > 30). This pattern held irrespective of daughters' weight status at birth, at age 4 years, or at age 20 years.

Conclusion

Our findings support that obesity prevention before pregnancy and strategies to maintain weight gain during pregnancy within the IOM guidelines might reduce the risk of being overweight in midlife for the offspring.

### The effect of disease penetrance, family size, and age of onset on family history with application to setting eligibility criteria for genetic testing [^a1e831bf]. Familial Cancer (2003). Low credibility.

The concept of family history of disease has been used as a surrogate for genetic susceptibility in many epidemiological studies and has also been important as a criterion for selecting individuals for genetic testing. However, little is known about the precise interplay between the true genetic model (genotype-specific penetrances, age of onset distribution), life expectancy, and reproductive patterns in determining the level of family history. In order to address these questions, we performed a simulation study to address these relationships. Factors examined were the age-, sex-, and genotype-specific penetrance of the disease and the distribution of the number of offspring per family. When considering the average number of affected individuals among first-degree relatives of mutation positive probands, penetrance-related factors accounted for 64% of the variance in the average number of affected first-degree relatives, and 58% of the variance in the number of affected first- or second-degree relatives. In general, the average proportion of mutation-positive probands with at least one affected first-degree relative was low, especially for a sex-limited disease, ranging between 20% and 46%, depending on the lifetime penetrance in mutation carriers. Lack of family history among first-degree relatives of mutation positive probands is not necessarily unexpected even for loci conferring relatively high lifetime risk. In selecting probands for genetic testing, we found that under a wide variety of conditions, criteria based on the number of affected among first- and second-degree relatives were superior to those based on first-degree family history alone.

### Parental age and offspring childhood mental health: a multi-cohort, population-based investigation [^ce234f2d]. Child Development (2020). Medium credibility.

Confirmatory Bayesian Hypotheses Evaluation

Once a set of competing informative hypotheses had been formulated (including the traditional null and alternative hypotheses), the empirical support for each pair of hypotheses was quantified using the Bayes factor (BF; Kass & Raftery, 1995). The BF is the ratio of the marginal likelihood of two competing hypotheses. Loosely speaking, the marginal likelihood of a hypothesis is the probability of that hypothesis given the data. Consequently, a BF comparing H 1 with H a of, for example, five indicates that the support in the data for H 1 is five times larger than for H a. The BF as the ratio of two marginal likelihoods implies that the fit (how well does a hypothesis describe the data set at hand) and the specificity (how specific is a hypothesis) of the hypotheses involved are accounted for (Gu, Mulder, & Hoijtink, 2018). To give an example, if β = −2, H 1: β < 0, and H a: β, both have an excellent fit, but H 1: β < 0 is more specific than H a: β (anything goes), and as a result, the BF will prefer H 1 over H a. Note that the size of the BF is related to sample size. If the precision of the evidence in the data for a hypothesis increases as a result of a larger sample, the BF for that hypothesis will increase as well. The BF implemented in the R package Bain (Gu et al. 2018) was used to evaluate informative hypotheses in the context of (cluster) multiple linear regression models.

Assuming that a priori each hypothesis is equally likely to be true, the BFs were transformed in so‐called posterior model probabilities (PMPs), that is, the support in the data for the hypothesis at hand given the set of hypotheses under evaluation. PMPs have values between 0 and 1 and sum to 1 for the hypotheses in the set under consideration. For example, if PMP H 0 = .05, PMP H 1 = .85, and PMP H a = .10, then it is clear that H 1 receives the most support from the data, because it has by far the largest PMP. Thus, the result of the confirmatory Bayesian hypotheses evaluation were PMPs for each hypothesis and for each informant by each of the cohorts that had ratings by this informant. The next step was to apply Bayesian evidence synthesis.

### Summary of the clinical practice guideline for the treatment of depression across three age cohorts [^526daeaa]. The American Psychologist (2022). High credibility.

Considerations for treatment implementation — importance of informed consent emphasizes that the panel "encourages all clinicians to provide informed consent to patients", and that "psychologists should obtain an informed consent from the patient prior to implementing psychological services". Informed consent requires clinicians to "inform clients/patients as early as is feasible in the therapeutic relationship about the nature and anticipated course of therapy, fees, involvement of third parties, and limits of confidentiality and provide sufficient opportunity for the client/patient to ask questions and receive answers", and the Code of Ethics notes it "should include information about any known diagnosis; why particular interventions are recommended and what is involved in these interventions; and benefits, harms, and burdens of possible interventions including those for choosing to receive no treatment", thereby allowing patients "to make an informed decision of whether to initiate or continue treatment", and satisfying "the General Principles of Beneficence and Nonmaleficence". For minors, "the provider should convey the same information to the parent/guardian who must provide consent for treatment" and also to "adolescents who must assent to treatment", and "for children, it also would be helpful to convey some of the information… in an age-appropriate manner".

### Risk of familial classical Hodgkin lymphoma by relationship, histology, age, and sex: a joint study from five nordic countries [^c53e47fe]. Blood (2015). Low credibility.

We aimed to provide the familial risk of classical Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) by relationship, histology, age at diagnosis, and sex. A cohort of 57,475 first-degree relatives of 13,922 HL patients diagnosed between 1955 and 2009 in 5 European countries was observed for HL incidence. The overall lifetime cumulative risk (CR) of HL in first-degree relatives of a patient with HL was 0.6%, which represents a threefold (standardized incidence ratio [SIR], 3.3; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.8–3.9) increased risk over the general population risk. The risk in siblings (6.0-fold; 95% CI, 4.8- to 7.4-fold) was significantly higher than in parents and/or children (2.1-fold; 95% CI, 1.6- to 2.6-fold). Very high lifetime risk of HL was found for those with multiple affected first-degree relatives (13-fold; 95% CI, 2.8- to 39-fold) and for same-sex twins (57-fold; 95% CI, 21- to 125-fold). We found high familial risks between some concordant histologic subtypes of HL such as lymphocyte-rich (81-fold; 95% CI, 30- to 177-fold) and nodular sclerosis (4.6-fold; 95% CI, 2.9- to 7.0-fold) and also between some discordant subtypes. The familial risk in sisters (9.4-fold; 95% CI, 5.9- to 14-fold) was higher than in brothers (4.5-fold; 95% CI, 2.9- to 6.7-fold) or unlike-sex siblings (5.9-fold; 95% CI, 4.3- to 8.1-fold). The lifetime risk of HL was higher when first-degree relatives were diagnosed at early ages (before age 30 years). This study provides tangible absolute risk estimates for relatives of HL patients, which can be used as a sex-, age-, and family history-based risk calculator for classical HL by oncologists and genetic counselors.

### SISE matters: the sum of information on seventy-yr-old equivalents measures pedigree information content when assessing the risk of HNPCC in a family [^ed18f97b]. Familial Cancer (2005). Low credibility.

Hereditary non-polyposis colon cancer (HNPCC) is a significant cause of colorectal and other malignancies. Due to the lack of features that reliably differentiate between a sporadic case and an inherited case of colon cancer, it is likely that HNPCC is under reported. The diagnosis of HNPCC relies heavily on finding multiple cases of colorectal or other specific cancers within a family. In the absence of a significant family history, a diagnosis of HNPCC is seldom considered. We postulate that small kinships — or, more specifically, kinships with a low information content — are more likely to be designated as having a low risk of an inherited cancer predisposition than are large kinships. This has the potential to exacerbate the under-diagnosis of HNPCC in small families, leading to inadequate treatment, follow-up and family counselling. We have developed an objective measure of the information content of individual pedigrees called the Sum of Information on Seventy-yr-old Equivalents (SISE) coefficient. The SISE coefficient is a function of the number of relatives in a kinship and their relationship to the proband, of their ages and of the age-dependent penetrance of HNPCC mutations. A population-based series of colorectal cancer cases was assessed, by currently accepted methods, for the likelihood of there being an HNPCC mutation segregating in each family. We observed that families with a low SISE coefficient were significantly more likely to be designated at low risk of HNPCC (P ≤ 0.001). Using a cumulative binomial distribution function, we estimated the likelihood of observing multiple cancers in families of different SISE coefficients.

### Sisters in motion: a randomized controlled trial of a faith-based physical activity intervention [^ac6e8b7d]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2010). Low credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate a faith-based intervention (Sisters in Motion) intended to increase walking in older, sedentary African-American women.

Design

Randomized controlled trial using within-church randomization.

Setting

Three Los Angeles churches.

Participants

Sixty-two African-American women aged 60 and older who reported being active less than 30 minutes three times per week and walked less than 35,000 steps per week as measured using a baseline pedometer reading.

Intervention

Intervention participants received a multicomponent curriculum including scripture readings, prayer, goal-setting, a community resource guide, and walking competitions. Intervention and control participants both participated in physical activity sessions.

Measurements

The primary outcome was change in weekly steps walked as measured using the pedometer. Secondary outcomes included change in systolic blood pressure (SBP). Outcomes were assessed at baseline and 6 months after the intervention.

Results

Eighty-five percent of participants attended at least six of eight sessions. Intervention participants averaged 12,727 steps per week at baseline, compared with 13,089 steps in controls. Mean baseline SBP was 156 mmHg for intervention participants and 147 mmHg for controls (P = 0.10). At 6 months, intervention participants had increased their weekly steps by 9,883 on average, compared with an increase of 2,426 for controls (P = 0.02); SBP decreased on average by 12.5 mmHg in intervention participants and only 1.5 mmHg in controls (P = 0.007).

Conclusion

The Sisters in Motion intervention led to an increase in walking and a decrease in SBP at 6 months. This is the first randomized controlled trial of a faith-based physical activity program to increase physical activity in older African-American women and represents an attractive approach to stimulate lifestyle change in this population.

### Expert panel on integrated guidelines for cardiovascular health and risk reduction in children and adolescents: summary report [^92cb5af2]. Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

Family history–based cardiovascular risk assessment in children and adolescents — evidence-graded guidance indicates that overwhelmingly consistent evidence from observational studies strongly supports inclusion of a positive family history of early coronary heart disease in identifying children at risk for accelerated atherosclerosis and for the presence of an abnormal risk profile (Grade B), and that identification of a positive family history for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and/or cardiovascular (CV) risk factors should lead to evaluation of all family members, especially parents, for CV risk factors (Grade B). For adults, a positive family history is defined as a parent and/or sibling with a history of treated angina, myocardial infarction, percutaneous coronary catheter interventional procedure, coronary artery bypass grafting, stroke or sudden cardiac death before age 55 years in men or age 65 years in women. Because the parents and siblings of children and adolescents are usually young themselves, it was the Expert Panel's consensus that when evaluating family history in a child, history should also be ascertained for the occurrence of CVD in grandparents, aunts, and uncles, although the evidence supporting this is insufficient to date (Grade D). Family history evolves as a child matures, so regular updates are necessary as part of routine pediatric care (Grade D), and education about the importance of accurate and complete family health information should be part of routine care for children and adolescents (Grade D).

### Practice bulletin no. 179 summary: breast cancer risk assessment and screening in average-risk women [^ba1e045c]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Medium credibility.

Practice Bulletin No. 179 — Level A recommendations for mammography in average-risk women state that women at average risk of breast cancer should be offered screening mammography starting at age 40 years, should initiate screening mammography no earlier than age 40 years, and if not initiated in their 40s should begin by no later than age 50 years, with the age to begin decided through a shared decision-making process that discusses benefits and harms. Women at average risk should have screening mammography every 1 or 2 years based on an informed, shared decision-making process; biennial screening mammography, particularly after age 55 years, is a reasonable option to reduce the frequency of harms with counseling that decreased screening comes with some reduction in benefits. Women at average risk should continue screening mammography until at least age 75 years.

### Breast cancer onset in twins and women with bilateral disease [^bdd29324]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose

Little is known of the onset of breast cancer in high-risk populations. We investigated the risk of breast cancer in twin sisters and in the contralateral breast taking family history into consideration.

Patients and Methods

We analyzed a Scandinavian population-based cohort of 2,499 female twin pairs, in which at least one had a diagnosis of breast cancer and estimated the risk of breast cancer in the sister. Using a total of 11 million individuals in Sweden with complete family links, we identified 93,448 women with breast cancer and estimated the risk of a bilateral breast cancer.

Results

The incidence of breast cancer in twin sisters of breast cancer patients was 0.64% per year and 0.42% per year in mono- and dizygotic twin sisters, respectively. In comparison, the risk of familial (affected first-degree relative) and nonfamilial bilateral breast cancer was 1.03% per year and 0.68% per year, respectively. Contrary to the risk of unilateral disease, the risk of cancer in the nonaffected twin and the opposite breast was not affected by age or time since first event. The relative risk of familial bilateral cancer was 52% higher (incidence rate ratio [IRR] = 1.52; 95% CI, 1.42 to 1.64) and the relative risk in the dizygotic twin sister was 25% lower (IRR = 0.75; 95% CI, 0.61 to 0.91) compared with the risk of nonfamilial bilateral cancer.

Conclusion

The elevated risk of breast cancer in high-risk groups is little affected by age and time since diagnosis. Our findings suggest that susceptible groups of women might have already aggregated genetic prerequisites for breast cancer.

### Increased cancer risks for relatives of very early-onset breast cancer cases with and without BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations [^445c5db3]. British Journal of Cancer (2010). Low credibility.

Results

Table 1 shows the centre-specific distribution of the index cases by age at diagnosis, family history of breast cancer and BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation status. The mean age at diagnosis of the index cases was 31.3 years (s.d. 2.8 years). Of these, 41 carried a mutation (24 in BRCA1, 16 in BRCA2 and 1 in both genes).

The 504 index cases reported having 504 fathers, 504 mothers, 602 full brothers and 598 full sisters with a combined total of 99 648 person-years of observation. The mean (s.d.) person-years was 59.8 (9.4) for fathers, 58.1 (8.5) for mothers, 33.5 (8.1) for brothers and 33.6 (7.4) for sisters.

Table 2 shows that the SIRs for breast cancer were elevated overall and in each of the subgroups defined by relationship to the index case, centre or testing status of the index case. The SIR for relatives of index cases with mutations in BRCA1 were 3.3 times that for relatives of index cases who tested negative (P = 0.003) and 2.5 times that for relatives of index cases who were not tested (P = 0.05). For relatives of index cases with mutations in BRCA2, the SIR was 3.1 times that for relatives who tested negative (P = 0.02) and 2.4 times that for relatives who were not tested (P = 0.1).

Overall, the breast cancer SIR was 1.7 times greater for sisters than mothers (P = 0.1). For relatives of the index cases not found to carry mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2, the SIR was 1.3 times greater for sisters than mothers (P = 0.5). Although the SIRs for sisters and mothers were 30 and 15% lower, respectively, for the relatives of the index cases who were not found to carry a mutation compared with all index cases, they were both elevated compared with the general population; see Figure 1.

### First-borns have greater BMI and are more likely to be overweight or obese: a study of sibling pairs among 26, 812 Swedish women [^ced73915]. Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health (2016). Low credibility.

Background

A number of large studies have shown phenotypic differences between first-borns and later-borns among adult men. In this study, we aimed to assess whether birth order was associated with height and BMI in a large cohort of Swedish women.

Methods

Information was obtained from antenatal clinic records from the Swedish National Birth Register over 20years (1991–2009). Maternal anthropometric data early in pregnancy (at approximately 10-12weeks of gestation) were analysed on 13,406 pairs of sisters who were either first-born or second-born (n = 26,812).

Results

Early in pregnancy, first-born women were of BMI that was 0.57kg/m(2) (2.4%) greater than their second-born sisters (p < 0.0001). In addition, first-borns had greater odds of being overweight (OR 1.29; p < 0.0001) or obese (OR 1.40; p < 0.0001) than second-borns. First-borns were also negligibly taller (+1.2mm) than their second-born sisters. Of note, there was a considerable increase in BMI over the 18-year period covered by this study, with an increment of 0.11kg/m(2) per year (p < 0.0001).

Conclusions

Our study corroborates other large studies on men, and the steady reduction in family size may contribute to the observed increase in adult BMI worldwide.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for breast cancer, more specifically with respect to indications for screening, average-risk females, ACOG 2017 guidelines recommend to offer screening mammography starting at age 40 years in females at average risk of breast cancer. Offer screening mammography no earlier than age 40 years in females at average risk of breast cancer. Begin screening mammography by no later than age 50 years in females not initiated screening in their 40s. Make the decision about the age to begin mammography screening through a shared decision-making process taking into account information about the potential benefits and harms.

Method

Procedures

Quantitative and qualitative data for our analyses were collected as part of the WFDS. Massachusetts city and town lists were used as the source of the original study sample. With the assistance of the Center for Survey Research at the University of Massachusetts, Boston, the researchers drew a probability sample of women ages 65–75 with two or more children from the greater Boston area. The Time 1 sample consisted of 566 mothers, which represented 61% of those who were eligible for participation, a rate comparable to that of similar surveys in the 2000s. Approximately 63% of the mothers agreed to provide contact information for their children; approximately 70% of those children agreed to participate, resulting in a sample of 774 children. Mothers and their adult children were interviewed between 2001 and 2003.

From 2008 to 2011, the original study was expanded to include a second wave of data collection. The survey team attempted to contact each mother who participated in the original study to schedule a 60–90 min in-person interview. At T2, 420 mothers were interviewed. Of the 146 mothers who participated at only T1, 78 had died between waves, 19 were too ill to be interviewed, 33 refused, and 16 could not be reached. Thus, the 420 represent 86% of mothers who were living at T2. Comparisons between the mothers alive at T2 who did and did not participate revealed that those who participated were better educated and in better health. Comparing the T1 and T2 samples revealed that mothers who were not interviewed at T2 were less healthy, less educated, less likely to have been married at T1, and more likely to be Black.

Following the interview, mothers were asked for their adult children's contact information; at T2, 81% of the mothers provided contact information — a rate higher than typically found in studies of multiple generations. Seventy-five percent of the adult children for whom contact information was available agreed to participate, resulting in a final sample of 826 children nested within 360 families. Semistructured interviews with the adult children were conducted on the telephone and lasted approximately 45–60 min. Analyses comparing mothers with and without participating children revealed no differences between these two groups in terms of race, marital status, education, age, or number of children; daughters, married offspring, and those with higher education were slightly more likely to participate, consistent with other studies of multiple generations.

Age-specific Incidence of breast cancer in identical co-twins of breast cancer cases compared to that in highest and lowest risk North American populations (42).

compares the age-specific rates in the MZ co-twins to the highest and lowest North American population-based rates. If the MZ proband had bilateral breast cancer, especially likely to represent heritable disease, the SIR for the co-twins showed a similar gradient with age and was even higher overall at 7.3, reflecting an attributable excess of 630%. Overall, 23% and 3% of the concordantly affected MZ pairs had one and more than one affected first degree relative respectively (data not shown).

In Table 2

Occurrence of female breast cancer in the twins of female breast cancer cases according to zygosity, age at first diagnosis and elapsed interval after proband diagnosis, prospective ascertainment a, the appearance of breast cancer in co-twins is described according to the interval following the proband's cancer diagnosis. Within the first five years after the diagnosis in a proband younger than age 40, the SIR among MZ co-twins was many times higher than expected, and the magnitude fell in inverse proportion to the time elapsed. This tendency was not apparent among DZ co-twins or after diagnoses in older probands.

Overall, 8.6% of the concordant and 7.6% of the discordant MZ pairs identified themselves as Jewish. Among those first diagnosed before age 50, 10.1% of those concordant and 6.8% of those discordant did so. Thus being Jewish increased the risk of concordant diagnoses by a factor of 1.3 overall, and 1.5 premenopausally. Of the 19 tested multiplex Jewish families with at least one premenopausal diagnosis, BRCA1 mutations were found in 4, and a BRCA2 mutation in 1.

More than 97% of the tissue samples from MZ twins (concordant and discordant) showed evidence of invasiveness (Table 3

PR and ER positivity were significantly more common among older cases, and ER positivity was significantly higher among cases from concordant than among those from discordant pairs, especially after age 50 (Figure 2

### Expert panel on integrated guidelines for cardiovascular health and risk reduction in children and adolescents: summary report [^a7941996]. PES (2012). Medium credibility.

Family history in cardiovascular health — evidence and pediatric evaluation indicate that overwhelmingly consistent evidence from observational studies strongly supports inclusion of a positive family history of early coronary heart disease in identifying children at risk for accelerated atherosclerosis and for the presence of an abnormal risk profile (Grade B). For adults, a positive family history is defined as a parent and/or sibling with a history of treated angina, myocardial infarction, percutaneous coronary catheter interventional procedure, coronary artery bypass grafting, stroke or sudden cardiac death before age 55 years in men or age 65 years in women. Because the parents and siblings of children and adolescents are usually young themselves, it was the Expert Panel's consensus that when evaluating family history in a child, history should also be ascertained for the occurrence of CVD in grandparents, aunts, and uncles, although the evidence supporting this is insufficient to date (Grade D). Overwhelmingly consistent evidence from observational studies shows that identification of a positive family history for CVD and/or CV risk factors should lead to evaluation of all family members, especially parents, for CV risk factors (Grade B). Family history evolves as a child matures, so regular updates are necessary as part of routine pediatric care (Grade D). Education about the importance of accurate and complete family health information should be part of routine care for children and adolescents, and as genetic sophistication increases, linking family history to specific genetic abnormalities will provide important new knowledge about the atherosclerotic process (Grade D).

Practice Bulletin No. 179 — Level C recommendations on clinical breast examination (CBE), self-awareness, and cessation decisions note that screening clinical breast examination may be offered to asymptomatic, average-risk women within an informed, shared decision-making approach that recognizes uncertain benefits and possible adverse consequences beyond screening mammography; if performed for screening, intervals of every 1–3 years for women aged 25–39 years and annually for women aged 40 years and older are reasonable, and CBE remains part of evaluation for high-risk or symptomatic women. Average-risk women should be counseled about breast self-awareness and encouraged to report changes, with breast self-awareness defined as a woman's awareness of the normal appearance and feel of her breasts. Age alone should not be the basis to continue or discontinue screening; beyond age 75 years, the decision to discontinue screening mammography should be based on a shared decision making process informed by the woman's health status and longevity.

### Heritable breast cancer in twins [^86e3b8f4]. British Journal of Cancer (2002). Low credibility.

Known major mutations such as BRCA1/2 and TP53 only cause a small proportion of heritable breast cancers. Co-dominant genes of lower penetrance that regulate hormones have been thought responsible for most others. Incident breast cancer cases in the identical (monozygotic) twins of representative cases reflect the entire range of pertinent alleles, whether acting singly or in combination. Having reported the rate in twins and other relatives of cases to be high and nearly constant over age, we now examine the descriptive and histological characteristics of the concordant and discordant breast cancers occurring in 2310 affected pairs of monozygotic and fraternal (dizygotic) twins in relation to conventional expectations and hypotheses. Like other first-degree relatives, dizygotic co-twins of breast cancer cases are at higher than usual risk (standardised incidence ratio (SIR) = 1.7, CI = 1.1–2.6), but the additional cases among monozygotic co-twins of cases are much more numerous, both before and after menopause (SIR = 4.4, CI = 3.6–5.6), than the 100% genetic identity would predict. Monozygotic co-twin diagnoses following early proband cancers also occur more rapidly than expected (within 5 years, SIR = 20.0, CI = 7.5–53.3). Cases in concordant pairs represent heritable disease and are significantly more likely to be oestrogen receptor-positive than those of comparable age from discordant pairs. The increase in risk to the monozygotic co-twins of cases cannot be attributed to the common environment, to factors that cumulate with age, or to any aggregate of single autosomal dominant mutations. The genotype more plausibly consists of multiple co-existing susceptibility alleles acting through heightened susceptibility to hormones and/or defective tumour suppression. The resultant class of disease accounts for a larger proportion of all breast cancers than previously thought, with a rather high overall penetrance. Some of the biological characteristics differ from those of breast cancer generally.

### Risk-adapted starting age of screening for relatives of patients with breast cancer [^fb2adfa1]. JAMA Oncology (2020). High credibility.

Importance

Breast cancer screening guidelines acknowledge the need for earlier screening for women at increased risk but provide limited guidance for women with a family history of breast cancer. A risk-adapted starting age of screening for relatives of patients with breast cancer may help supplement current screening guidelines.

Objective

To identify the risk-adapted starting age of breast cancer screening on the basis of a woman's detailed family history.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This nationwide cohort study analyzed data recorded in the Swedish family-cancer data sets. All women born from 1932 onward and with at least 1 known first-degree relative (FDR) were included (N = 5 099 172). Data from January 1, 1958, to December 31, 2015, were collected. Data were analyzed from October 1, 2017, to March 31, 2019.

Exposures

Family history of breast cancer in FDRs and second-degree relatives (SDRs).

Main Outcomes and Measures

Primary invasive breast cancer diagnosis and the age at which women with different constellations of family history attained the risk level at which breast screening is usually recommended.

Results

Of the 5 099 172 women included in the study, 118 953 (2.3%) received a diagnosis of primary invasive breast cancer. A total of 102 751 women (86.4%; mean [SD] age at diagnosis, 55.9 [11.1] years) did not have family history of breast cancer in FDRs and SDRs at the time of their diagnosis. Risk-adapted starting age of breast cancer screening varied by number of FDRs and SDRs with breast cancer diagnosis and the age at diagnosis of the FDRs. For example, for screening recommendation at age 50 years for the general population (2.2% 10-year cumulative risk), women with multiple affected FDRs, with the youngest affected relative receiving a diagnosis before age 50 years, reached the benchmark risk level at age 27 years. When the youngest relative received a diagnosis after age 50 years, however, this risk level was attained at age 36 years.

Conclusions and Relevance

This study identifies possible risk-based starting ages for breast cancer screening based on population-based registers. These results may serve as high-quality evidence to supplement current screening guidelines for relatives of patients with breast cancer.

### HIV diagnoses among persons aged 13–29 years-United States, 2010–2014 [^5ab16889]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2018). Low credibility.

In 2014, persons aged 13–29 years represented 23% of the U.S. population, yet accounted for 40% of diagnoses of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection during the same year (1). During 2010–2014, the rates of diagnosis of HIV infection decreased among persons aged 15–19 years, were stable among persons aged 20–24 years, and increased among persons aged 25–29 years (1). However, these 5-year age groups encompass multiple developmental stages and potentially mask trends associated with the rapid psychosocial changes during adolescence through young adulthood. To better understand HIV infection among adolescents aged 13–17 years and young adults aged 18–29 years in the United States and identify ideal ages to target primary HIV prevention efforts, CDC analyzed data from the National HIV Surveillance System (NHSS)* using narrow age groups. During 2010–2014, rates of diagnosis of HIV infection per 100,000 population varied substantially among persons aged 13–15 years (0.7), 16–17 years (4.5), 18–19 years (16.5), and 20–21 years (28.6), and were higher, but less variable, among persons aged 22–23 years (34.0), 24–25 years (33.8), 26–27 years (31.3), and 28–29 years (28.7). In light of the remarkable increase in rates between ages 16–17, 18–19, and 20–21 years, and a recent study revealing that infection precedes diagnosis for young persons by an average of 2.7 years (2), these findings demonstrate the importance of targeting primary prevention efforts to persons aged < 18 years and continuing through the period of elevated risk in their mid-twenties.

### Anticipation in familial hematologic malignancies [^e3f69004]. Blood (2011). Low credibility.

We describe a collection of 11 families with ≥ 2 generations of family members whose condition has been diagnosed as a hematologic malignancy. In 9 of these families there was a significant decrease in age at diagnosis in each subsequent generation (anticipation). The mean age at diagnosis in the first generation was 67.8 years, 57.1 years in the second, and 41.8 years in the third (P < .0002). This was confirmed in both direct parent-offspring pairs with a mean reduction of 19 years in the age at diagnosis (P = 0.0087) and when the analysis was repeated only including cases of mature B-cell neoplasm (P = 0.0007). We believe that these families provide further insight into the nature of the underlying genetic mechanism of predisposition in these families.

### Heritable breast cancer in twins [^31678371]. British Journal of Cancer (2002). Low credibility.

Our results suggest that heritable breast cancer represents a larger proportion of the total burden than conventionally thought. In Scandinavia, 14% of MZ twin pairs were found to be concordant. However, the population-based ascertainment ignored discordant mortality and necessarily excluded substantial numbers of subjects at the extremes of age at risk, as has been pointed out, indicating that the actual cumulative concordance exceeds 20%. If so, and if more than 77% of the cases in MZ twins represent heritable forms of disease, the proportion of all breast cancer represented by heritable disease exceeds 15%, and we have speculated on other grounds that it may be even higher.

The pattern of occurrence in MZ and DZ co-twins is determined by the mode of inheritance of disease. Any excess risk to a DZ twin of a case is the result of sharing 50% of the genome and a common early environment. Given a predominantly autosomal dominant mode of inheritance, the increment of risk to an MZ co-twin would be slightly less than double that to a DZ co-twin. This is because the additional risk from sharing the other half of the genome would produce the same incremental contribution as that from sharing the first half, and little, if any, added environmental risk would be expected, because the commonality of MZ twins' early environment is probably only marginally greater than that of DZ twins. Since the DZ twin of a case suffers a 70% increase in risk (overall relative risk of 1.7 from Table 1), an increase of under 140% would be expected. In fact, a relative risk of 4.4 (Table 1) indicates an increase of at least 340%, and the confidence limits are such that the difference cannot be explained by chance. A similarly large increase in risk attributable to MZ status can be calculated from the Scandinavian twins study. Such a large increment indicates that most heritable breast cancers do not result from single autosomal dominant alleles. While a recessive mode of inheritance cannot be ruled out, that would seem an unlikely alternative, especially as a cause of older cases. It is more likely that a substantial proportion of heritable breast cancer in both younger and older women is polygenic, resulting from the interaction of two or more coexisting alleles. In such a circumstance, a gene acting through a hormonal mechanism might only do so in the presence of another existing genetic error in, for example, a repair (tumour suppression) gene. Such a combination would explain how a general defect of molecular repair might only produce malignancy in one specific organ.

Menopause diagnosis and definitions — In a woman with an intact uterus, menopause is a clinical diagnosis based upon cessation of menses for at least 12 months, and sex steroids, gonadotropins, inhibin B, or anti-Mullerian hormone measurements do not further inform the diagnosis, do not indicate precisely when the final menstrual period will occur, and will not influence management unless a woman is seeking fertility. Table definitions specify that spontaneous menopause occurs at an average age of 51 y, early menopause is cessation of ovarian function between ages 40 and 45, and POI is loss of ovarian function before the age of 40 y with the prevalence of POI is approximately 1%.

Carrier screening and genetic risk terminology — the glossary defines "Carrier Screening" as "Genetic testing performed on an asymptomatic individual to determine whether that person has a mutation or abnormal allele within a gene associated with a particular disorder", noting that "Carrier screening can be performed for one specific condition or for multiple disorders", and "Expanded Carrier Screening" as "Disease screening that evaluates an individual's carrier state for multiple conditions at once and regardless of ethnicity". Risk descriptors include "A Priori Risk: The best assessment of risk before testing results are known" and "Residual Risk: The risk that an individual is a carrier for or is affected by a disorder despite a negative screening test". "Consanguinity" is defined as "A union between two individuals who are second cousins or closer in family relationship". The glossary also defines "Susceptibility Testing" as "Determines whether an individual carries a genetic variation that increases the potential for developing a specific condition", clarifying that "Not every person with a genetic variant will develop the condition, but they are at increased risk", with "An example of susceptibility testing is BRCA testing", and it defines "Variants of Uncertain Significance" as "An identified DNA change that either cannot be characterized reliably as benign or pathogenic at the time of the study because of limited data describing outcomes in association with the changes or is associated with a variable phenotype (because of incomplete penetrance or variable expressivity)".

### Step-grandparenthood in the United States [^80b93754]. The Journals of Gerontology: Series B, Psychological Sciences and Social Sciences (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

This study provides new information about the demography of step-grandparenthood in the United States. Specifically, we examine the prevalence of step-grandparenthood across birth cohorts and for socioeconomic and racial/ethnic groups. We also examine lifetime exposure to the step-grandparent role.

Methods

Using data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics and the Health and Retirement Study, we use percentages to provide first estimates of step-grandparenthood and to describe demographic and socioeconomic variation in who is a step-grandparent. We use life tables to estimate the exposure to step-grandparenthood.

Results

The share of step-grandparents is increasing across birth cohorts. However, individuals without a college education and non-Whites are more likely to become step-grandparents. Exposure to the step-grandparent role accounts for approximately 15% of total grandparent years at age 65 for women and men.

Discussion

A growing body of research finds that grandparents are increasingly instrumental in the lives of younger generations. However, the majority of this work assumes that these ties are biological, with little attention paid to the role of family complexity across three generations. Understanding the demographics of step-grandparenthood sheds light on the family experiences of an overlooked, but growing segment of the older adult population in the United States.

 ______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ FINALLY, IF YOU ARE STILL NOT SURE WHAT TO DO ABOUT THE PILLS YOU HAVE MISSED:

Use a BACK-UP METHOD anytime you have sex.

 KEEP TAKING ONE "ACTIVE" PILL EACH DAY until you can reach your healthcare professional.

How to Use the Blister Packs for the 28 Tablets

The blister pack comes to you set up for Sunday Start. If your physician has instructed you to start pill-taking on the SUNDAY after your menstrual period has begun or if your period begins on Sunday you will take your first pill that very same day. Start with the Sunday pill in row #1. Take one active pill daily for 21 days followed by one green placebo pill daily for 7 days.
If you start pill-taking on a day other than SUNDAY, peel the attached sticker by selecting the day of the week you plan to start. Place the sticker over the pre-printed days of the week and make sure it lines up with the pills. This sticker will help to remind you to take your pill every day. Take the white to off-white pill which corresponds to the day in row #1 during the first 24 hours of your period and then take one pill each day, left to right, until the last pill in row # 3 has been taken. Once all of the active pills have been taken, proceed to row #4 and take the 7 "reminder" pills to complete the pack.
When you start taking the pill for the first time, use an additional method of protection until you have taken your first 7 pills.
Your blister pack containing 28 individually sealed pills. Note that the pills are arranged in four numbered rows of 7 pills each with the days of the week printed above them. The 21 (white to off-white) pills are "active" birth control pills. The 7 green pills are inactive; their purpose is to help make your pill-taking schedule simple and easy to remember.
You must take your pills in order, one pill each day at intervals of 24 hours. Always start with the white to off-white pills in row #1. To remove a pill, push down on the pill with your thumb and forefinger so that the pill releases through the back of the dispenser. See diagram below:

The study was based on Swedish national health and population registers: (1) the National Patient Register collects all hospital discharge diagnoses in Sweden from 1987 and 80% of hospital-based outpatient visits from 2001, (2) the National Prescribed Drug Register captures redeemed drug prescriptions from all pharmacies since 2005, (3) the National Cause of Death Register comprises death certificates since 1952, (4) the Longitudinal Integration Database for Health Insurance and Labor Market Studies integrates sociodemographic information for all residents aged 16 years and older since 1990, (5) the Total Population Register includes country of birth and migrations, and (6) the Multi-Generation Register documents parental information on residents since 1961. Registers were linked using the personal identification number assigned to all residents at birth or migration to Sweden.

Study Design

We conducted a nationwide, population-based matched cohort study. Using incidence density sampling, women of reproductive age with a first diagnosis of PMDs between January 1, 2001, and December 31, 2018, were randomly matched by year of birth to 5 women who were free of PMD at that date. Reproductive age was defined as the period between age 15 years (96% of Swedish women had menarche by then,) and 52 years (the average age of menopause in Sweden). Women who had undergone hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy before matching were excluded from the analyses. Individuals were followed-up until death, emigration, or December 31, 2018, whichever came first. If matched unaffected women received a diagnosis of PMD during the study period, their follow-up was censored at that time (eFigure in Supplement 1).

We also conducted a sibling comparison to address unmeasured confounding from factors shared by sisters, such as early family environment and genetics. In brief, full siblings were identified as sharing both biological parents recorded in the Multi-Generation Register. Women with PMDs were matched to their full sisters on the basis of age at diagnosis such that the unaffected sister(s) had no PMD diagnosis at the same age when the affected sister received a diagnosis.

Contralateral breast cancer (CBC) incidence and cumulative risk by time since first breast cancer are stratified by age at first diagnosis. For first breast cancer diagnosis at age ≥ 40–50 years, incidence rates per 1,000 person-years (95% CI) and cumulative risks (%; 95% CI) include: ≤ 5 years 12.7 (6.1 to 26.7) and 6 (3 to 14); > 5–10 years 16.3 (8.5 to 31.2) and 14 (8 to 22); > 10–15 years 15.5 (6.5 to 37.3) and 20 (13 to 29); > 15–20 years 7.0 (1.0 to 49.6) and 23 (15 to 35); > 20–37 years 8.1 (1.2 to 57.7) and 28 (17 to 44). For first breast cancer diagnosis at age ≥ 50 years, values include: ≤ 5 years 20.8 (10.8 to 40.0) and 9 (5 to 17); > 5–10 years 17.9 (9.0 to 35.8) and 17 (11 to 27); > 10–15 years 4.1 (0.6 to 29.1) and 20 (13 to 30); > 15–20 years 0.0 and 20 (13 to 30); > 20–30 years 0.0 and 20 (13 to 30).

### How to inform at-risk relatives? Attitudes of 1379 Dutch patients, relatives, and members of the general population [^20a79b38]. Journal of Genetic Counseling (2020). Medium credibility.

3.2 Do people wish to be informed about their genetic risks?

Table 2 shows participants' answers on the survey items. The population sample was asked whether they wished to be informed about genetic risks. Most participants indicated they were interested in knowing whether they were at risk of an autosomal dominant disease. This was the case for both treatable conditions and untreatable conditions, although the proportions were significantly different with a moderate effect size (X 2 (1) = 54.327, p < .001, V = 0.243). The remaining participants indicated in an open answer that they would not want to receive this information. Others responded that this depends on disease characteristics, individual characteristics of relatives (i.e. age, personal circumstances), closeness of relatives, and/or whether the proband would be able to inform relatives. Chi‐square analysis only showed nonsignificant or weak significant associations in sociodemographic characteristics (see Table 3).

3.3 Which relatives should be informed?

A majority of participants from the patient and population sample indicated that relatives should be informed following the principles of a cascade screening approach (i.e. only first‐degree relatives at first, subsequently second‐ and further‐degree relatives; see Table 2). Other options were to inform only first‐degree relatives and to inform both first‐ and further‐degree relatives at the same time. More participants from the population sample preferred to inform only first‐degree relatives, in contrast to more participants of the patient sample preferring to inform first‐ and further‐degree relatives at the same time. In the patient sample, only a very small minority opted for not informing relatives at all (see Table 2). With regard to sociodemographic characteristics, participants from the patient sample without children more often opted for informing relatives following the principles of cascade screening (X 2 (3) = 13.632, p = .003, V = 0.201). Other characteristics showed nonsignificant or weak significant differences in both samples (see Table 3).

### Comparing within-and between-family polygenic score prediction [^f9073acf]. American Journal of Human Genetics (2019). Medium credibility.

Family Socio-economic Status (SES)

This measure was calculated as the mean of the z-standardized maternal age at birth of the first child, maternal and paternal highest education level (coded from 1 = "no qualifications" to 8 = "postgraduate qualifications"), and maternal and paternal occupation (coded from 1 = "Other Occupations – dockers, porters, labourers,… " to 9 = "Managers and Administrators"). These measures were assessed at first contact at age 1.8 (SD = 1.13). Data were available for 2,962 twin pairs.

Measures were selected based on largest sample sizes available, and ages at phenotype assessment matching most closely the ages of GWA study samples to maximize predictive power. None of the measures were significantly associated with birth order, but most showed sex and age differences (see Table S1) and were therefore adjusted for these effects using the regression method, and z-standardized residuals (mean = 0, SD = 1) were used for all subsequent analyses.

### Causes of blood methylomic variation for middle-aged women measured by the humanMethylation450 array [^b01315b8]. Epigenetics (2017). Low credibility.

To address the limitations in current classic twin/family research on the genetic and/or environmental causes of human methylomic variation, we measured blood DNA methylation for 479 women (mean age 56 years) including 66 monozygotic (MZ), 66 dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs and 215 sisters of twins, and 11 random technical duplicates using the HumanMethylation450 array. For each methylation site, we estimated the correlation for pairs of duplicates, MZ twins, DZ twins, and siblings, fitted variance component models by assuming the variation is explained by genetic factors, by shared and individual environmental factors, and by independent measurement error, and assessed the best fitting model. We found that the average (standard deviation) correlations for duplicate, MZ, DZ, and sibling pairs were 0.10 (0.35), 0.07 (0.21), -0.01 (0.14) and -0.04 (0.07). At the genome-wide significance level of 10–7, 93.3% of sites had no familial correlation, and 5.6%, 0.1%, and 0.2% of sites were correlated for MZ, DZ, and sibling pairs. For 86.4%, 6.9%, and 7.1% of sites, the best fitting model included measurement error only, a genetic component, and at least one environmental component. For the 13.6% of sites influenced by genetic and/or environmental factors, the average proportion of variance explained by environmental factors was greater than that explained by genetic factors (0.41 vs. 0.37, P value < 10–15). Our results are consistent with, for middle-aged woman, blood methylomic variation measured by the HumanMethylation450 array being largely explained by measurement error, and more influenced by environmental factors than by genetic factors.

### Committee opinion no. 691: carrier screening for genetic conditions [^da97cd27]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Medium credibility.

Carrier screening for genetic conditions — when an individual is found to be a carrier for a genetic condition, the individual's relatives are at risk of carrying the same mutation, and the patient should be encouraged to inform his or her relatives of the risk and the availability of carrier screening; the obstetrician–gynecologist or other health care provider should not disclose this information without permission from the patient. It is important to obtain the family history of the patient and, if possible, her partner as a screening tool for inherited risk, and the family history should include the ethnic background of family members as well as any known consanguinity.

Methods

Participants

In Study 1, 29 individuals participated (age = 27.07 ± 5.30, 18 women); in Study 2, 18 individuals (age = 28.89 ± 4.80, 7 women) participated in three separate testing sessions on different days; in Study 3, 21 individuals participated (age = 29.55 ± 5.59, 11 women); in Study 4, a 27 years old male, otherwise healthy, individual with the diagnosis of isolated congenital anosmia participated. The diagnosis was confirmed by an ENT physician within the Swedish healthcare system and further supported by our own assessments that indicated that he scored at random when his ability to identify, discriminate, and detect odors was assessed with the standardized clinical odor test Sniffin Sticks. Moreover, both his parents, as well as himself, reported no recollection of him ever having an odor sensation and T1-weighted and T2-weighted MR images indicated total absence of bilateral OB and having an average olfactory sulcus depth of 1.12 mm, both morphological measures are indicative of congenital anosmia. All other participants had a functional olfactory sense with no history of head trauma leading to unconsciousness, did not use any prescription drugs, were not habitual smokers, and declared themselves as generally healthy. Functional sense of smell was assessed both by verbal confirmation from the participant and a 5-item 4-alternative cued odor identification test comprising of odors from the Sniffin Sticks odor identification test. A minimum of three correct answers were required to participate (mean correct over Studies 1–4: 4.5). Given the low rate of functional anosmia in our tested age group and the known chance score, the likelihood of erroneously labeling an individual with anosmia as having a functional sense of smell is about 0.05%. Participants were recruited through the Karolinska Institutet's participant recruiting site and signed informed consent was obtained before participants enrolled in the respective study. A unique set of participants was used for each study. All aspects were approved by the Swedish national ethical permission board, Etikprövningsnämnden (EPN: 2017/2332–31/1).

### Obesity and reproduction: a committee opinion [^eac6f61e]. Fertility and Sterility (2021). High credibility.

BMI at age 18 and PCOS-related outcomes — higher BMI at the age of 18 years predicted anovulatory infertility with and without polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), with relative risk (RR) 1.0 at BMI 20.0–21.9; 1.3 at BMI 24–25.9; 1.7 at BMI 26–27.9; 2.4 at BMI 28–29.9; 2.7 at BMI 30–31.9; and 2.7 at BMI > 32 kg/m2. Despite increasing obesity over time, it is noted that the risk of PCOS is only minimally increased with obesity. In women with PCOS, improved ovulation rates and menstrual regularity have been demonstrated with modest weight loss through lifestyle modification without adjunctive weight loss medications, and correction of amenorrhea occurs in several women with obesity after bariatric surgery.

### Addressing sex as a biological variable in preclinical models of lung disease: an official American Thoracic Society research statement [^6e541d2a]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Study of disease phenotypes across puberty — Age- and sex-dependent considerations for rodent models in lung disease research. Differential lung disease manifestations can occur before and after puberty, and when choosing an animal model it is essential to consider the differential timing of pubertal onset between sexes and across species; in rodents, early markers of puberty are vaginal opening, first vaginal cornification, and the onset of cyclicity in females, whereas balanopreputial separation is used as a marker in males. In C57BL/6 females, vaginal opening occurs at 25 days of age on average, whereas in males of the same strain, balanopreputial separation occurs between 27 and 28 days; the peripubertal period in mice is generally considered 28–40 days for females and 30–40 days for males. When designing experiments across puberty, researchers should consider that rapid changes in body mass can account for differences in lung-related phenotypes, these differences are important for dosing while administering drugs, treatments, or anesthesia, and equipment needs may vary depending on the age of the animal.

### Older adults' internal migration toward faraway siblings [^2e4c69ac]. The Journals of Gerontology: Series B, Psychological Sciences and Social Sciences (2022). Medium credibility.

Data and Methods

Data Selection

The data for the analyses are drawn from several Swedish population and administrative registers, which contain information on all Swedes born from 1932 onward who have been registered as residents in Sweden at any time since 1961. Each resident of Sweden was identified by a unique identification number that enabled us to link individuals to their family members and across different registers. Key demographic information — date of birth, sex, and country of birth — was derived from the Total Population Register. Family members were linked to each other through the Multigenerational Register. Annually updated socioeconomic information, including marital status and partnership transitions, was derived from the Longitudinal Integration Database for Health Insurance and Labor Market Studies.

From these data, we extracted unique dyads of index persons and their distant half- and full siblings. We did not have links to stepsiblings. The first requirement for sample selection was that the index person's age was 70 or over at the first observation. We chose this distinction because by this age, a majority of older adults' parents will be deceased, which helps separate the migration attraction of siblings from that of older parents in need of care.

An older person entered the population at risk of moving closer to a sibling if the sibling lived at least 50 km away in the baseline year. To the best of our knowledge, there has been no information about the distance between siblings at which contact and exchange of support can lead to a desire to converge geographically, so we adopted a move of at least 40 km. Asfound, moving toward family can be considered a reasonably valid proxy for family-motivated migration. We considered relocation within 10 km as a convergent move because this distance can be traveled within 30 min, thereby enabling relatively frequent contact and exchange of support. The initial distance between siblings of 50 km allows us to capture moves to within 10-km radius of a sibling's neighborhood. However, we employed several sensitivity checks using alternative distance thresholds (see Supplementary Material). Older adults without siblings and those whose siblings lived outside Sweden or all within 50 km of the index person's neighborhood were excluded from the study. We also excluded dyads in which the index person or a sibling was born outside Sweden because information about them could be of lower quality and we could not control for their place of birth.

### Sharing BRCA1 / 2 test results with first-degree relatives: factors predicting who women tell [^ae465358]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose

Patient communication with relatives about cancer genetic test results is the primary means for alerting those who may benefit from identification of hereditary risk. This study identifies factors predicting patterns of disclosure of BRCA1/2 test results to first-degree relatives (FDRs) among women tested in a clinical protocol.

Patients and Methods

A total of 273 women completed a family communication measure 4 months after BRCA1/2 result disclosure. chi2 analyses and logistic regression models identified factors predicting sharing of the test result.

Results

Most FDRs were informed of the participant's test result by 4 months; female relatives were more likely to be informed than males. Tested women conveyed inconclusive results (variant or negative without known familial mutation) less frequently to their sisters than conclusive (positive/true negative) results (P = 0.03). Twenty-three percent of participants did not inform their father. Informing brothers was more likely when BRCA1/2 was inherited through paternal lineage (P = 0.04), but 29% of brothers were not informed. Women older than age 40 were less likely to share their result with their parents (P = 0.03) than were women ≤ 40. Children's ages influenced communication to offspring; most children were told.

Conclusion

Demographic, health-, and test-related factors predicted genetic test result communication to FDRs. Additional research investigating the full spectrum of discussion within families and motives for incomplete sharing of genetic test results with relatives may suggest strategies for providers and targeted educational interventions for patients to enhance family communication.

### Breast and bowel cancers diagnosed in people' too young to have cancer': a blueprint for research using family and twin studies [^287c1597]. Genetic Epidemiology (2024). Medium credibility.

2 RESOURCES

We are motivated by existing data and resources, and what might exist in the near future, starting with extraordinary long‐term family‐based cohorts arising from the Breast and Colon CFRs. Both Cancer Family Registries have been funded for a further 5 years and the breast cancer initiative has a focus on recruiting the next‐generation and more young cancer families.

2.1 Breast CFR

The Breast CFR is an international cohort study of multigenerational population‐ and clinic‐based families with and without breast cancer funded continuously by the National Institutes of Health (USA) since 1995, conducted in the United States, Canada and Australia (John et al; Neuhausen et al; Terry et al.). It comprises 33,000 women and 7000 men from 15,000 families and the 20‐year follow‐up has just been completed. At baseline, we collected blood, biospecimens, medical records, family pedigree, cancer and epidemiology data. There are 1508 BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers, 12,265 breast cancers (8755 diagnosed before age 45) at enrolment with age‐matched population‐ and family‐based controls, 2250 incident breast cancers including 1135 in those unaffected at baseline. There have been comprehensive genetic and environmental risk characterisations.

2.2 Colon CFR

Similar to the Breast CFR, the Colon CFR has been funded continuously by the National Institutes of Health (USA) since 1997. Conducted in the United States, Canada and Australasia, it comprises 23,000 women and 19,000 men from 15,000 families and the 20‐year follow‐up has just been completed (Jenkins et al.). At baseline, we collected blood, biospecimens, medical records, family pedigree, cancer and epidemiology data. There are 2300 DNA mismatch repair gene carriers, 12,000 bowel cancers (2000 diagnosed before age 50) with age‐matched population‐ and family‐based controls, 1058 incident bowel cancers including 445 in those unaffected at baseline. This is the world's most comprehensive data and biospecimens for Lynch syndrome and young bowel cancer research.

### Genetic risk and age in Parkinson's disease: continuum not stratum [^12b31cd9]. Movement Disorders (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Recent genomewide association study meta-analyses have identified 28 loci associated with risk of Parkinson's disease (PD). We sought to investigate whether these genetic risk factors are associated with PD age at onset.

Methods

Genetic risk scores from these loci were calculated for 6,249 cases. Linear regression tested associations between cumulative genetic risk and PD age at onset.

Results

Increasing genetic risk scores were associated with earlier age at onset (beta = -0.10, P = 2.92 × 10(-8), adjusted r(2) = 0.27). Single standard deviation increase in genetic risk score is associated with 37.44 d earlier age at onset. Highest genetic risk was found at 31 to 60 y, onset slightly below average age at onset (AAO).

Conclusions

Common genetic risk factors have a small but consistent association with AAO in PD.

### Long-term follow-up guidelines for survivors of childhood, adolescent, and young adult cancers [^e488b0de]. PES (2023). High credibility.

Additional information — breast imaging considerations states that Mammography is limited in its ability to evaluate the premenopausal breast. It further notes, MRI is now recommended as an adjunct to mammography in women treated with chest radiation for childhood cancer, similar to screening of other populations at high risk for breast cancer (e.g., premenopausal known or likely carriers of pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant of known penetrance). The upper age limit at which mammography and breast MRI should be used for breast cancer surveillance has not been established. Risk considerations include the directive to Consider patient and cancer/treatment factors, pre-morbid/co-morbid health conditions, and health behaviors that may increase risk, including Patient factors: Family history of breast cancer; Cancer/Treatment factors: Higher radiation dose, especially ≥ 10 Gy, longer time since radiation (> 5 years). Note: decreased risk in women treated with alkylating agents of sufficient dose to ablate ovarian function, although annual surveillance is still recommended.; and Pre-morbid/Co-morbid medical conditions: Personal history of BRCA1, BRCA2, ATM or p53 mutation or in absence of personal genetic testing, known BRCA mutation in first degree relative.

### Sudden death in the young: information for the primary care provider [^47915c10]. Pediatrics (2021). High credibility.

Evaluation of remaining family members — many cardiovascular diseases that put young individuals at risk for sudden death have a familial inheritance pattern, and screening relatives provides the opportunity to identify at-risk individuals and initiate management. In the absence of a diagnosis in the affected individual, cascade screening of first-degree relatives has improved the diagnostic yield. Detailed cardiovascular evaluation of first-degree SCA and SCD relatives has shown that 22% to 30% of families have evidence of inherited cardiac disease, and one study reported that 18% of surviving relatives of unexplained SCA and SCD victims reported one or more cardiac symptoms in a first-degree relative of the proband.
