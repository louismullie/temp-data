## Question

Extrapyramidal reaction

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about extrapyramidal reactions — what they are, how they present, their causes, timelines, management, diagnostics, differentials, and key evidence-based points. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining extrapyramidal reactions and their temporal categories. Then, I should classify the major clinical syndromes. Next, I will review causative drugs and mechanisms, followed by risk factors and characteristic clinical timelines. After that, I should outline acute and chronic management strategies with dosing. I will then consider diagnostics and differentials, address special populations, and finally consolidate key evidence-based conclusions.

> Let me first confirm the definition and scope so I don't miss the clinical frame. Extrapyramidal reactions are a spectrum of drug-induced movement disorders primarily resulting from disruption of dopaminergic neurotransmission in the basal ganglia, with a classic temporal division into acute syndromes (hours to months) and tardive syndromes (months to years), and drug-induced parkinsonism is defined by the emergence of parkinsonian signs during treatment with agents that impair dopamine function, often via postsynaptic D2 receptor blockade [^114Bq51t].

> Hold on, I should verify the core clinical phenotypes to ensure consistent terminology. The major extrapyramidal syndromes broadly align with the ESRS framework and include acute dystonia with sudden, often painful muscle contractions; akathisia characterized by subjective restlessness with observable fidgeting; parkinsonism marked by bradykinesia, rigidity, and tremor; and tardive dyskinesia with choreoathetoid movements after chronic exposure, with ESRS, AIMS, and SAS commonly used for structured assessment of these domains and to separate motor phenomena from psychiatric symptoms [^116kmHsX] [^112nec4N]. I should double-check time courses: acute dystonia often appears within 24–48 hours of starting an offending agent, while parkinsonism typically emerges within days to three months and tends to be symmetric and bilateral, which helps distinguish it from idiopathic Parkinson disease [^111dkzqS] [^114Bq51t].

> Next, I will examine causative drugs and their relative risks, but wait, let me verify the hierarchy. High-potency first-generation antipsychotics like haloperidol, fluphenazine, perphenazine, and pimozide carry a higher EPS liability than most second-generation agents, though the risk with SGAs is not zero and varies by agent and dose; relevant antiemetics such as metoclopramide and droperidol are established causes, and multiple labels and clinical data corroborate these associations, unified mechanistically by D2 blockade in the nigrostriatal pathway [^112nec4N] [^116jWX87] [^11775Ma9] [^111dkzqS] [^1179uKWV] [^111y3Gp1]. Let me reconsider the SGA assumption before concluding: aripiprazole, olanzapine, and quetiapine generally show lower EPS rates than FGAs in labeling and trials, but events still occur and can be dose-related or idiosyncratic, so a blanket "low risk" statement would be misleading without context [^113gz4jQ] [^115nW15m] [^113MSNMr].

> I need to check the pathophysiology next to tie mechanism to phenotype. The core mechanism is D2 receptor antagonism or low-efficacy partial agonism attenuating dopamine signaling, with EPS reflecting on-target blockade in the nigrostriatal system; kinetic data suggest that faster association rates and higher rebinding within synaptic microdomains correlate with higher EPS liability, while dissociation rates more closely track prolactin elevations rather than EPS, indicating that binding kinetics meaningfully shape clinical risk, although polypharmacology can create outliers to simple kinetic models; additionally, acute dystonia has been linked to a dopamine–acetylcholine imbalance with excess striatal cholinergic output, supporting anticholinergics as first-line reversal agents [^111y3Gp1] [^111YocXS] [^111n75mL] [^114m9LQz]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about a single model explaining everything; alternative hypotheses including relative 5-HT2A antagonism, differential D2 temporal occupancy, and receptor supersensitivity in tardive states also contribute to the heterogeneous clinical picture and may modulate risk across agents and patients [^1163vzLk].

> I will now examine risk factors so I can calibrate prevention and monitoring. Young males, particularly under 30, are at higher risk of acute dystonia early in treatment, especially with potent dopamine blockers or with higher doses; conversely, tardive dyskinesia risk and irreversibility increase with age and cumulative exposure and are particularly elevated among elderly women; dose and potency increase risk across classes, and some labels note dose-related severity with potential reactions at relatively low doses; metoclopramide dystonia risk is increased in pediatric and young adult populations and may be influenced by genetic or familial neurological susceptibility, and pre-existing spontaneous movement disorders in antipsychotic-naïve psychosis can confound attribution and mandate a baseline exam before initiating dopamine-blocking therapy [^111dkzqS] [^117LBUeG] [^115imHGm] [^116jWX87] [^111CJnTW] [^114m9LQz]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought female sex was uniformly protective for acute dystonia, but the metoclopramide literature notes higher rates in certain female cohorts, so sex effects may vary by drug and context rather than adhering to a single rule [^114m9LQz].

> Let me think about the clinical signatures and time course to anchor bedside recognition. Acute dystonic reactions typically arise within 24–48 hours of exposure and can include torticollis, oculogyric crisis, tongue protrusion, bulbar speech changes, trismus, and rarely stridor from laryngospasm; population estimates for metoclopramide suggest approximately 1 in 500 at standard adult doses with higher rates in high-risk groups; antipsychotic-induced parkinsonism presents with bradykinesia, tremor, rigidity, masked facies, and classically shows bilateral symmetry without a prominent resting tremor, often improving within 2–3 months of discontinuation; tardive dyskinesia typically follows months to years of exposure, may be heralded by fine vermicular tongue movements, and can persist or become irreversible despite drug cessation, underscoring the need for early detection and action; akathisia spans subjective inner restlessness with objective pacing or fidgeting that can be misread as anxiety or agitation if not specifically elicited [^111dkzqS] [^114Bq51t] [^113KSCUJ] [^112nec4N]. I should double-check reversibility expectations and avoid overpromising recovery because a subset of DIP and TD cases can persist even after stopping the offending agent [^114Bq51t] [^112nec4N].

> Next, I should review acute and chronic management to ensure I cite dose-verified options. For acute dystonia, first-line agents are anticholinergics such as benztropine 1–2 mg IM or diphenhydramine 50 mg IM for rapid relief, along with airway protection and supportive measures as needed, and the APA guideline supports offering anticholinergics in patients experiencing acute dystonia with antipsychotic therapy; for prevention and ongoing care, use the lowest effective dose, prefer agents with lower EPS liability when feasible, and restrict metoclopramide to no more than 12 weeks; symptomatic management of drug-induced parkinsonism includes benztropine 1–4 mg PO every 12–24 hours or amantadine 100 mg twice daily or extended-release regimens as labeled; akathisia may respond to dose reduction, benzodiazepines, or beta-blockers such as propranolol; definitive management prioritizes discontinuing or switching the offending drug when clinically possible and monitoring systematically with validated scales [^111dkzqS] [^116HALpQ] [^1139jdN9] [^113hfo6F] [^114AQHoU] [^116mMRWZ] [^111zztUV] [^116HALpQ] [^1133GxDo] [^113KSCUJ]. I almost wrote that there is no effective treatment for tardive dyskinesia, but wait, I should verify alignment with the referenced labels here; the haloperidol labeling emphasizes that antiparkinson agents usually do not help TD and recommends discontinuation if TD appears, which is the conservative, label-based posture reflected in these materials, so I will adhere to that framing for this synthesis while recognizing that contemporary practice includes additional options beyond the scope of these references [^112nec4N].

> I need to ensure the diagnostic and differential strategy is tight so we don't miss mimics. Organic conditions can masquerade as EPS, including chronic subdural hematoma causing parkinsonism and organophosphate poisoning with basal ganglia signal changes and reversible extrapyramidal signs, so neuroimaging and toxicologic context are vital when clinical features are atypical or the medication timeline is unconvincing; pre-treatment baseline motor exams are essential in psychosis due to the nontrivial prevalence of spontaneous movement disorders; structured scales such as ESRS, AIMS, and SAS improve detection, longitudinal tracking, and separation from psychiatric symptoms or sedation effects, and movement-disorder instrument reviews support these tools despite some psychometric caveats [^1176jWWn] [^114hkwso] [^111CJnTW] [^116kmHsX] [^114dbH6S] [^112Pw859]. Hold on, I should verify that I am not over-relying on any single scale; different instruments emphasize different domains, so matching the scale to the suspected syndrome and clinic workflow remains important [^114dbH6S].

> I will now address special populations where risk-benefit calculus shifts. In pediatrics, EPS occur more frequently and metoclopramide is not approved, warranting avoidance and heightened vigilance; in pregnancy and pediatric use with trifluoperazine, labels recommend stopping and not reinstituting if acute dystonia or significant EPS occur; in Parkinson's disease, dopamine-blocking antiemetics like metoclopramide are contraindicated due to worsening of baseline motor symptoms; in the elderly, TD risk is highest, particularly among women, so employing the minimal effective dose with frequent reassessment is prudent [^113KSCUJ] [^114inarW] [^116HALpQ] [^117LBUeG]. But wait, what if the clinical scenario mandates an antiemetic in PD or elderly patients? I need to ensure alternatives without D2 blockade are chosen to mitigate EPS risk, consistent with these cautions, even though specific alternates are outside the current reference set [^113KSCUJ] [^114inarW].

> Finally, I should consolidate the key principles so the takeaways are actionable. Mechanistically, EPS across drug classes largely unify under nigrostriatal D2 receptor blockade, with binding kinetics, particularly association rate and synaptic rebinding, helping to explain cross-drug variability and pointing to why some SGAs still cause EPS at higher exposures or in susceptible patients; clinically, acute syndromes such as dystonia and parkinsonism are typically reversible with dose adjustment and anticholinergic or amantadine use, whereas tardive syndromes may persist and require early detection and drug discontinuation; prevention hinges on using the lowest effective doses, selecting lower-liability agents when possible, limiting prokinetics like metoclopramide to short courses, and performing baseline motor examinations to aid attribution during follow-up [^111YocXS] [^111y3Gp1] [^112nec4N] [^114Bq51t] [^111CJnTW].

---

Extrapyramidal reactions are **drug-induced movement disorders** — dystonia, parkinsonism, akathisia, and tardive dyskinesia — most often from **dopamine D2 blockade** [^111y3Gp1] in the nigrostriatal pathway [^114Bq51t]. They are most strongly linked to **first-generation antipsychotics** and **metoclopramide** [^111dkzqS], with risk rising with **higher dose** [^112nec4N], younger age, **male sex** [^116jWX87], and prior reactions. Management is to stop or reduce the offending drug, give anticholinergics or benzodiazepines for acute dystonia/akathisia [^113hfo6F], and switch to lower-EPS agents for persistent symptoms [^1138CNru]; tardive dyskinesia may be irreversible [^112nec4N], so **early detection and prevention** are critical.

---

## Clinical manifestations

Extrapyramidal reactions present as **distinct clinical syndromes**:

- **Acute dystonia**: Sudden, sustained muscle contractions causing abnormal postures, torticollis, oculogyric crisis [^114m9LQz], trismus, and laryngospasm [^111dkzqS].

- **Parkinsonism**: Bradykinesia, rigidity [^114Bq51t], tremor, and masked facies, typically bilateral and symmetric.

- **Akathisia**: Subjective restlessness [^116HALpQ] with an urge to move, often with anxiety and agitation.

- **Tardive dyskinesia**: Late-onset, potentially irreversible choreoathetoid movements [^117LBUeG], especially of the face and tongue [^112nec4N].

---

## Pathophysiology

The primary mechanism involves **dopamine D2 receptor blockade** in the **nigrostriatal pathway**, disrupting motor control and causing EPS [^111y3Gp1]. Chronic blockade can lead to dopamine receptor **supersensitivity** [^1163vzLk], contributing to tardive dyskinesia. Antipsychotic binding kinetics — particularly association rates [^111YocXS] — correlate with EPS risk [^111y3Gp1].

---

## Medications associated with extrapyramidal reactions

Several **medication classes** are implicated:

| **Medication class** | **Examples** | **EPS risk** |
|-|-|-|
| First-generation antipsychotics | - Haloperidol <br/> - Fluphenazine <br/> - Chlorpromazine | High [^111y3Gp1] [^116jWX87] |
| Second-generation antipsychotics | - Risperidone <br/> - Olanzapine <br/> - Aripiprazole | Moderate [^1133GxDo] [^111y3Gp1] |
| Antiemetics | - Metoclopramide <br/> - Prochlorperazine | Moderate [^111dkzqS] [^113VQrCT] |
| Other medications | - Lithium <br/> - SSRIs <br/> - Methylphenidate | Low to moderate [^114Bq51t] [^113saCoP] |

---

## Risk factors

Susceptibility to extrapyramidal reactions varies with age, with **younger patients** more prone to acute dystonia [^111dkzqS] and **older patients** more prone to **tardive dyskinesia** [^117LBUeG]. Sex also modifies risk: **males** have a higher risk of acute dystonia [^116jWX87], whereas **females** have a higher risk of tardive dyskinesia. A **genetic predisposition** [^112WgCdZ], including a family history of EPS or neurological disorders, increases risk [^114m9LQz]. Medication-related factors such as **high potency**, rapid titration, and high doses [^112nec4N] further elevate risk.

---

## Diagnostic criteria and assessment tools

Diagnosis is **clinical**, supported by standardized scales [^114dbH6S]:

- **Simpson-Angus Scale (SAS)**: Assesses drug-induced parkinsonism.

- **Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale (BARS)**: Evaluates akathisia severity.

- **Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS)**: Detects tardive dyskinesia.

- **Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale (ESRS)**: Comprehensive assessment of EPS [^116kmHsX].

---

## Management strategies

Effective management involves:

- **Immediate actions**: Discontinue or reduce the offending medication [^112Pw859]; switch to lower-EPS agents (e.g. atypical antipsychotics) [^1138CNru].

- **Pharmacological interventions**: Anticholinergics (benztropine, diphenhydramine) for acute dystonia and parkinsonism [^1139jdN9]; benzodiazepines or beta-blockers for akathisia [^116HALpQ]; VMAT2 inhibitors (valbenazine, deutetrabenazine) for tardive dyskinesia.

- **Supportive care**: Patient education, regular monitoring, and dose adjustments.

---

## Prognosis and long-term outcomes

Most acute EPS resolve with prompt intervention, but **tardive dyskinesia can be persistent or irreversible** [^112nec4N], especially with prolonged exposure. **Early detection and intervention** improve outcomes and reduce chronic disability.

---

## Preventive measures

Prevention centers on **selecting lower-EPS agents** — preferring atypical antipsychotics when appropriate [^1133GxDo] — and using the **lowest effective dose** with **slow titration**. Additional measures include regular monitoring with standardized scales [^114dbH6S] and **proactive patient education** about EPS symptoms and encouraging early reporting.

---

Extrapyramidal reactions are **drug-induced movement disorders** from dopamine D2 blockade [^111y3Gp1], especially with first-generation antipsychotics and metoclopramide [^111dkzqS]. Management includes stopping or reducing the offending drug, using anticholinergics or benzodiazepines, and switching to lower-EPS agents [^1138CNru]; **early detection and prevention** are essential to avoid persistent symptoms [^112nec4N].

## References

### Neuroleptic-induced parkinsonism: Clinicopathological study [^114Bq51t]. Movement Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

Drug-induced parkinsonism (DIP) is defined as the appearance of parkinsonism during treatment with pharmaceutical agents, most of which impair dopamine (DA) function. DIP was first recognized in the early 1950s as a common complication of neuroleptic therapy, known as neuroleptic-induced parkinsonism (NIP). Other drugs that produce DA receptor block or deplete DA also result in parkinsonism. Initially, it was considered an exclusive side effect of first-generation neuroleptics that block D2 receptors. Additionally, agents such as calcium channel blockers, gastrointestinal prokinetics, antiarrhythmics, and antidepressants have been implicated in DIP. The mechanisms through which these drugs induce parkinsonism are not fully understood.

Older literature indicates that DIP is the second-most common cause of parkinsonism. The incidence of DIP might have declined with the widespread use of atypical antipsychotics, although definitive evidence is lacking. In most cases, DIP is reversible once the offending agent is discontinued. However, symptoms persist after cessation of the drug in up to 25% of cases. Symptoms of parkinsonism are typically bilateral and symmetric, lacking a prominent resting tremor. These symptoms may manifest within a few days after the initiation of neuroleptic therapy, with 90% of cases emerging by three months. The risk of DIP with different agents varies widely. Postsynaptic D2 receptor block by neuroleptics is closely linked to the antipsychotic effect, and the production of extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) is required for classification as conventional neuroleptics.

### Metoclopramide [^111dkzqS]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) can manifest during treatment with metoclopramide.

- **Acute dystonic reactions**: These occur in approximately 1 in 500 patients treated with the usual adult dosages of 30 to 40 mg/day. Acute dystonic reactions typically appear within the first 24 to 48 hours of treatment, occurring more frequently in pediatric patients and adults under 30. Higher doses, such as those used in the prophylaxis of vomiting due to cancer chemotherapy, further increase the frequency of these reactions. Symptoms may include involuntary movements of the limbs, facial grimacing, torticollis, oculogyric crisis, rhythmic tongue protrusion, bulbar speech, trismus, or dystonic reactions resembling tetanus. Rarely, they may present as stridor and dyspnea due to potential laryngospasm. If such symptoms occur, an intramuscular injection of 50 mg Benadryl® (diphenhydramine hydrochloride) typically alleviates them. Alternatively, Cogentin® (benztropine mesylate), 1 to 2 mg intramuscularly, may also reverse these reactions.

- **Tardive dyskinesia (see boxed warnings)**: Metoclopramide treatment can lead to tardive dyskinesia (TD), which is a potentially irreversible and disfiguring disorder characterized by involuntary movements of the face, tongue, or extremities. The risk of developing tardive dyskinesia increases with prolonged treatment and the cumulative dose. An analysis reveals that approximately 20% of patients used metoclopramide for longer than 12 weeks. It is advised to avoid treatment exceeding 12 weeks in all but rare cases.

### Haloperidol [^112nec4N]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

There is no known effective treatment for tardive dyskinesia; antiparkinson agents usually do not alleviate the symptoms of this syndrome. It is suggested that all antipsychotic agents be discontinued if these symptoms appear. Should it be necessary to reinstitute treatment, increase the dosage of the agent, or switch to a different antipsychotic agent, this syndrome may be masked.

It has been reported that fine vermicular movement of the tongue may be an early sign of tardive dyskinesia, and if the medication is stopped at that time, the full syndrome may not develop.

- **Tardive dystonia**: Tardive dystonia, not associated with the above syndrome, has also been reported. Tardive dystonia is characterized by delayed onset of choreic or dystonic movements, is often persistent, and has the potential of becoming irreversible.

- **Dystonia**:

	- **Class effect**: Symptoms of dystonia — prolonged abnormal contractions of muscle groups — may occur in susceptible individuals during the first few days of treatment. Dystonic symptoms include spasm of the neck muscles, sometimes progressing to tightness of the throat, swallowing difficulty, difficulty breathing, and/or protrusion of the tongue. While these symptoms can occur at low doses, they occur more frequently and with greater severity with high potency and at higher doses of first-generation antipsychotic drugs. An elevated risk of acute dystonia is observed in males and younger age groups.

### Extrapyramidal side effects of antipsychotics are linked to their association kinetics at dopamine dreceptors [^111y3Gp1]. Nature Communications (2017). Low credibility.

Imbalances in dopamine signaling are believed to play an integral part in the symptoms of schizophrenia. The efficacy of all currently marketed antipsychotic drugs (APDs) is thought to be mediated by attenuation of dopamine transmission through their actions as antagonists or low efficacy partial agonists at the dopamine D2 receptor (D2R). However, the therapeutic window, i.e. the margin between the therapeutic dose and the dose that produces adverse side effects, varies considerably across these drugs.

Extrapyramidal motor symptoms (e.g. acute dystonia and parkinsonian symptoms such as bradykinesia and tremor) and excess prolactin release are major adverse side effects of APDs mediated by blockade of D2R signaling in the nigrostriatal dopamine system and the tuberoinfundibular pathway, respectively. Many "typical" or first-generation antipsychotics (FGAs) exhibit a relatively narrow therapeutic window with respect to these "on-target" side effects. The term "atypical" was first applied to clozapine, an efficacious APD with markedly lower "on-target" side effects when compared to FGAs, but that carries the risk for agranulocytosis, a potentially life-threatening off-target toxicity.

From the study of clozapine and FGAs emerged second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) designed to exhibit wider therapeutic windows. However, certain SGAs first introduced as atypical have in subsequent studies been shown to have therapeutic indices more consistent with typical APDs, with the converse also true for FGA/typical APDs, such as melperone.

### Toronova SUIK [^112JyRAp]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Hemic and lymphatic**: ecchymosis, eosinophilia, epistaxis, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia.

- **Metabolic and nutritional**: weight change.

- **Nervous system**:
	- **Mood and perception**: abnormal dreams, abnormal thinking, anxiety, confusion, depression, euphoria, hallucinations, inability to concentrate, nervousness
	- **Physical symptoms**: asthenia, extrapyramidal symptoms, hyperkinesis, insomnia, paresthesia, somnolence, stupor, tremors, vertigo, malaise

- **Reproductive, female**: infertility.

- **Respiratory**: asthma, cough, dyspnea, pulmonary edema, rhinitis.

- **Special senses**: abnormal taste, abnormal vision, blurred vision, hearing loss.

- **Urogenital**: cystitis, dysuria, hematuria, increased urinary frequency, interstitial nephritis, oliguria/polyuria, proteinuria, renal failure, urinary retention.

Other rarely observed reactions (reported from postmarketing experience in patients taking ketorolactromethamine or other NSAIDs) are:

- **Body as a whole**: angioedema, death, hypersensitivity reactions such as anaphylaxis, anaphylactoid reaction, laryngeal edema, tongue edema, myalgia.

- **Cardiovascular**: arrhythmia, bradycardia, chest pain, flushing, hypotension, myocardial infarction, vasculitis.

- **Dermatologic**: exfoliative dermatitis, erythema multiforme, Lyell's syndrome, bullous reactions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis.

### SPL drug information for benztropine mesylate [^114AQHoU]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

The dosage of benztropine mesylate for the treatment of extrapyramidal symptoms in adults (drug-induced) is 1–4 mg taken orally every 12 to 24 hours.

---

### Trifluoperazine hydrochloride [^116HALpQ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Adverse reactions include drowsiness, dizziness, skin reactions, rash, dry mouth, insomnia, amenorrhea, fatigue, muscular weakness, anorexia, lactation, blurred vision, and neuromuscular (extrapyramidal) reactions.

- **Neuromuscular (extrapyramidal) reactions**: These symptoms occur in a significant number of hospitalized mental patients and may be characterized by motor restlessness, dystonic type reactions, or may resemble parkinsonism. Depending on the severity, the dosage should be reduced or discontinued. If therapy is restarted, it should be at a lower dosage. In children or pregnant patients, the drug should be stopped and not reinstituted. Barbiturates administered by a suitable route often suffice to manage symptoms. Injectable diphenhydramine hydrochloride may be useful. In severe cases, an antiparkinsonism agent, excluding levodopa, can rapidly reverse symptoms. Supportive measures such as maintaining a clear airway and adequate hydration should also be employed.

- **Motor restlessness**: Symptoms may include agitation, jitteriness, and sometimes insomnia. These often disappear spontaneously but can resemble original neurotic or psychotic symptoms. Dosage should not be increased until these side effects have subsided. If symptoms are too troublesome, control is usually possible through dosage reduction or drug change. Treatment with antiparkinsonism agents, benzodiazepines, or propranolol may be helpful.

### SPL drug information for amantadine hydrochloride [^116mMRWZ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

The dosage of amantadine hydrochloride taken orally for the treatment of drug-induced extrapyramidal symptoms in adults is as follows: the maintenance dosage is 100 mg taken twice daily (BID), with a maximum dosage of 300 mg per day.

### Prevalence of spontaneous movement disorders (dyskinesia, parkinsonism, akathisia and dystonia) in never-treated patients with chronic and first-episode psychosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111CJnTW]. BMJ Mental Health (2024). Low credibility.

The findings of this systematic review and meta-analysis underscore the importance of recognizing pre-existing SMDs as a distinct subtype or symptom cluster within schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders. Spontaneous motor abnormalities have been linked to more severe positive and negative symptoms, cognitive dysfunction, poorer treatment response, and long-term outcomes.

It is unclear what effect antipsychotic treatment has on patients with pre-existing SMDs as it may be linked to a complex mixture of primary and drug-induced features. Different studies have shown inconsistent outcomes: some indicate worsening of SMDs, particularly SP, especially in the acute treatment phase and with typical antipsychotics, which later tends to subside with long-term treatment. Conversely, some studies report improvement in pre-existing SMDs, especially with some atypical antipsychotics with low propensity to cause EPSEs. Finally, some motor abnormalities, such as dyskinesia, appear to re-emerge in the long term, potentially due to the progression of the movement disorder and/or different pathophysiological mechanisms linked to long-term dopamine receptor blockade due to antipsychotic medication.

There is an important need for better recognition of cases with SMDs and the implementation of individualized treatment approaches, especially in the context of the rapidly emerging precision psychiatry. Clinicians are urged to conduct baseline examinations before commencing treatments to inform more appropriate treatment decisions.

### Manual for the extrapyramidal symptom rating scale (ESRS) [^116kmHsX]. Schizophrenia Research (2005). Low credibility.

The Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale (ESRS) was developed to assess four types of drug-induced movement disorders (DIMD): Parkinsonism, akathisia, dystonia, and tardive dyskinesia (TD). Comprehensive ESRS definitions and basic instructions are given. Factor analysis provided six ESRS factors: 1) hypokinetic Parkinsonism; 2) orofacial dyskinesia; 3) trunk/limb dyskinesia; 4) akathisia; 5) tremor; and 6) tardive dystonia. Two pivotal studies found high inter-rater reliability correlations in both antipsychotic-induced movement disorders and idiopathic Parkinson disease.

- **Inter-rater reliability and certification of raters**: For inter-rater reliability and certification of raters, ≥ 80% of item ratings of the complete scale should be ± 1 point of expert ratings, and ≥ 70% of ratings on individual items of each ESRS subscale should be ± 1 point of expert ratings.

- **Cross-scale comparison**: During a cross-scale comparison, AIMS and ESRS were found to have a 96% (359/374) agreement between TD-defined cases by DSM-IV TD criteria.

- **International studies**: Two recent international studies using the ESRS included over 3000 patients worldwide and showed an incidence of TD ranging from 10.2% (2000) to 12% (1998).

- **Specificity of ESRS**: ESRS specificity was investigated through two different approaches, path analyses, and ANCOVA PANSS factors changes, which found that ESRS measurement of drug-induced EPS is valid and discriminative from psychiatric symptoms.

### SPL drug information for metoclopramide hydrochloride [^111t8VhZ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Common adverse reactions (1–10%) associated with the use of metoclopramide hydrochloride PO (also known as Reglan, Gimoti) include acute dystonic reactions, akathisia, extrapyramidal signs, fatigue, hallucinations, parkinsonism, restlessness, seizures, somnolence, and tardive dyskinesia.

### Extrapyramidal syndrome [^114hkwso]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Low credibility.

Organophosphate (OP) poisoning is a common occurrence in the rural areas of developing countries like India. Acute cholinergic crisis is one of the important causes of mortality related to OP poisoning. Delayed peripheral neuropathy, extrapyramidal syndromes, and neuropsychiatric manifestations are the major consequences of secondary neuronal damage. This case illustrates a 14-year-old girl who ingested 50 mL of OP pesticide and developed extrapyramidal symptoms in the form of parkinsonism and hand dystonia, in spite of immediate medical attention. MRI of the brain with T2, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery, and diffusion-weighted sequences revealed bilateral symmetrical basal ganglia hyperintensities. Further follow-up revealed a significant clinical improvement with marked resolution of the brain lesions. The reversible extrapyramidal symptoms, with the disappearance of neuroimaging findings without neuropathy or neuropsychiatric manifestations, are unusual in OP poisoning.

### Brainstem atrophy is linked to extrapyramidal symptoms in frontotemporal dementia [^116mZF7L]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Low credibility.

Parkinsonism is a combination of certain extrapyramidal (EP) movement symptoms, usually defined by bradykinesia combined with either resting tremor or rigidity. Atypical parkinsonisms, such as progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and corticobasal degeneration (CBD), are rare diseases that share common clinical and neuropathological features (tauopathies) with frontotemporal dementia (FTD). The most prevalent of the clinical FTD spectrum diseases is behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD). BvFTD is commonly characterized as a cognitive and behavioral disease, but the association between EP symptoms and bvFTD has also been known for decades. Akinesia, rigidity, and tremor were introduced as supportive diagnostic features in the 1998 diagnostic criteria of FTD. These features were removed from the 2011 diagnostic criteria, but especially atypical parkinsonism remains a common presentation in bvFTD patients. In different FTD cohorts, parkinsonism has been observed in approximately 23% of the patients. The hexanucleotide repeat expansion in the C9orf72 gene is the most common cause of familial FTD, and parkinsonism has been reported in 25–35% of patients carrying the expansion. Correlation of frontal and anterior temporal cortical atrophy with FTD is well established, but the structural and functional correlates of the EP symptoms remain to be explored in these patients.

In this retrospective register study, we aimed to identify imaging biomarkers using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) that differ.

### Metoclopramide [^111QDmxW]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Symptoms of overdosage may include drowsiness, disorientation, and extrapyramidal reactions. Anticholinergic or antiparkinson drugs or antihistamines with anticholinergic properties may be helpful in controlling the extrapyramidal reactions. Symptoms are self-limiting and usually disappear within 24 hours.

Hemodialysis removes relatively little metoclopramide, probably because of the small amount of the drug in blood relative to tissues. Similarly, continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis does not remove significant amounts of the drug. It is unlikely that the dosage would need to be adjusted to compensate for losses through dialysis. Dialysis is not likely to be an effective method of drug removal in overdose situations.

Unintentional overdose due to misadministration has been reported in infants and children with the use of metoclopramide syrup. While there was no consistent pattern to the reports associated with these overdoses, events included seizures, extrapyramidal reactions, and lethargy.

- **Methemoglobinemia**: Methemoglobinemia has occurred in premature and full-term neonates who were given overdoses of metoclopramide (1 to 4 mg/kg/day orally, intramuscularly, or intravenously for 1 to 3 or more days). Methemoglobinemia can be reversed by the intravenous administration of methylene blue. However, methylene blue may cause hemolytic anemia in patients with G6PD deficiency, which may be fatal (see precautions – other special populations).

### Motor symptoms of schizophrenia: Is tardive dyskinesia a symptom or side effect? A modern treatment [^112WgCdZ]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2011). Low credibility.

Abnormal involuntary dyskinetic movements in schizophrenia patients have been documented for more than 140 years. Clinicians should distinguish between two kinds of disturbances — spontaneous dyskinetic movements and movements induced by psychotropic medications — which may appear similar clinically. Tardive dyskinesia (TD), a modern term, is a potentially permanent neurological hyperkinetic movement disorder that occurs after months or years of taking psychotropic drugs. Several distinct forms of TD exist, specifically tardive akathisia, tardive blepharospasm, tardive dystonia, tardive gait, tardive myoclonus, tardive tremor, and tardive tics, each with different pathophysiologies and treatments. The pathogenesis of TD remains unclear, and the pathophysiology is complex and multifactorial. Moreover, there is solid evidence of a genetic predisposition to TD. This article summarizes recent relevant publications concerning TD and the most recent studies regarding treatment of this disorder with antioxidative agents.

### Ondansetron [^114JMGsD]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

The following are clinically significant adverse reactions described elsewhere in the labeling:

- **Hypersensitivity reactions**: See warnings and precautions (5.1).
- **QT prolongation**: See warnings and precautions (5.2).
- **Serotonin syndrome**: See warnings and precautions (5.3).
- **Myocardial ischemia**: See warnings and precautions (5.4).
- **Masking of progressive ileus and gastric distension**: See warnings and precautions (5.5).

Clinical trials experience indicates that because trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in these trials may not directly compare with those of other drugs and may not reflect rates observed in practice. The following adverse reactions have been reported in clinical trials of patients treated with ondansetron. Although a causal relationship to therapy with ondansetron was unclear in many cases, notable findings are as follows:

Prevention of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting:

- The most common adverse reactions, reported in ≥ 4% of 300 adults receiving a single 24-mg dose of ondansetron orally in two trials for the prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with highly emetogenic chemotherapy (cisplatin ≥ 50 mg/m²), were headache (11%) and diarrhea (4%).
- Additional common adverse reactions reported in four trials in adults for prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with moderately emetogenic chemotherapy (primarily cyclophosphamide-based regimens) are detailed in the associated documentation.

### Extrapyramidal side effects of antipsychotics are linked to their association kinetics at dopamine D receptors [^111YocXS]. Nature Communications (2017). Low credibility.

Atypical antipsychotic drugs (APDs) have been hypothesized to show reduced extrapyramidal side effects (EPS) due to their rapid dissociation from the dopamine D2 receptor. However, support for this hypothesis is limited to a relatively small number of observations made across several decades and under different experimental conditions. Here we show that association rates, but not dissociation rates, correlate with EPS.

We measured the kinetic binding properties of a series of typical and atypical APDs in a novel time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer assay and correlated these properties with their EPS and prolactin-elevating liabilities at therapeutic doses. EPS are robustly predicted by a rebinding model that considers the microenvironment of postsynaptic D2 receptors and integrates association and dissociation rates to calculate the net rate of reversal of receptor blockade. Thus, optimizing binding kinetics at the D2 receptor may result in APDs with an improved therapeutic profile. Atypical antipsychotics show reduced extrapyramidal side effects compared to first-generation drugs. Here the authors use time-resolved FRET to measure binding kinetics and show that side effects correlate with drug association rates to the D2 receptor, while dissociation rates correlate with prolactin elevation.

### Abdominal pain with rigidity secondary to the anti-emetic drug metoclopramide [^115VVvKw]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

We report a case of abdominal pain with rigidity, mimicking an acute abdomen, caused by metoclopramide, a common anti-emetic drug. Extrapyramidal symptoms are commonly reported side effects of this medication. They generally include involuntary movements of limbs, torticollis, oculogyric crisis, rhythmic protrusion of the tongue, trismus, or dystonic reactions resembling tetanus. Abdominal rigidity due to this medication, resembling an acute abdomen, has not been previously reported. This case report illustrates the importance of considering medication side effects when evaluating a patient with abdominal pain and rigidity.

### Neurobiological mechanisms associated with antipsychotic drug-induced dystonia [^112BzwBj]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2021). Low credibility.

Dystonia is by far the most intrusive and invalidating extrapyramidal side effect of potent classical antipsychotic drugs. Antipsychotic drug-induced dystonia is classified in both acute and tardive forms. The incidence of drug-induced dystonia is associated with the affinity to inhibitory dopamine D2 receptors. Particularly, acute dystonia can be treated with anticholinergic drugs, but the tardive form may also respond to such antimuscarinic treatment, which contrasts their effects in tardive dyskinesia. Combining knowledge of the pathophysiology of primary focal dystonia with the anatomical and pharmacological organization of the extrapyramidal system may shed some light on the mechanism of antipsychotic drug-induced dystonia. A suitable hypothesis is derived from the understanding that focal dystonia may be due to a faulty processing of somatosensory input, leading to inappropriate execution of well-trained motor programs. Neuroplastic alterations of the sensitivity of extrapyramidal medium-sized spiny projection neurons to stimulation, induced by the training of specific complex movements, lead to the sophisticated execution of these motor plans. The sudden and non-selective disinhibition of indirect pathway medium-sized spiny projection neurons by blocking dopamine D2 receptors may distort this process. Shutting down the widespread influence of tonically active giant cholinergic interneurons on all medium-sized spiny projection neurons by blocking muscarinic receptors may result in a reduction of the influence of extrapyramidal cortical-striatal-thalamic.

### Reglan [^113KSCUJ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2020). High credibility.

In addition to tardive dyskinesia (TD), metoclopramide may cause other extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), parkinsonian symptoms, and motor restlessness. Advise patients to seek immediate medical attention if such symptoms occur and to discontinue Reglan.

Extrapyramidal symptoms such as acute dystonic reactions occurred in patients treated with metoclopramide dosages of 30 mg to 40 mg daily. These reactions were more frequent in adults less than 30 years of age and at higher than recommended dosages. EPS occurred more frequently in pediatric patients compared to adults, although Reglan is not approved for use in pediatric patients. Symptoms can occur in the first 24 to 48 hours after starting metoclopramide. These symptoms included involuntary movements of limbs, facial grimacing, torticollis, oculogyric crisis, rhythmic protrusion of the tongue, bulbar type of speech, trismus, or dystonic reactions resembling tetanus. Rarely, dystonic reactions presented as stridor and dyspnea, possibly due to laryngospasm. Diphenhydramine hydrochloride or benztropine mesylate may be used to treat these adverse reactions. Avoid using Reglan in patients receiving other drugs that can cause EPS, for example, antipsychotics.

Parkinsonian symptoms such as bradykinesia, tremor, cogwheel rigidity, and mask-like facies have occurred after starting metoclopramide. These symptoms are more common within the first 6 months but can also occur after longer periods. Symptoms generally subside within 2 to 3 months after discontinuation of Reglan. It is advisable to avoid using Reglan in patients with Parkinson's disease and other patients being treated with similar medications.

### Treating movement disorders and akathisia as side effects of antipsychotic pharmacotherapy [^1138CNru]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2008). Low credibility.

One of the most common reasons for switching antipsychotic medication is to reduce the burden of side effects, particularly movement disorders and akathisia associated with typical antipsychotics. Adjusting the antipsychotic dose and, if necessary, switching treatment to an antipsychotic with a low extrapyramidal symptom liability may help to optimize the clinical management of schizophrenia. Switching from a typical to an atypical antipsychotic or between atypical antipsychotics involves considering a variety of factors relating to the patient, illness, medication, and the patient's environment.

### Chronic subdural haematoma mimicking extrapyramidal symptoms [^1176jWWn]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

The presentation of chronic subdural hematoma (SDH) can vary from no symptoms to decreased memory, confusion, weakness or numbness of the arms, legs, and face, as well as difficulty in speech and walking. Movement disorders such as Parkinsonism can also be associated with SDH. Therefore, elderly people with subacute progressive Parkinsonism should undergo CT studies to differentiate it from primary Parkinsonism.

The etiology of chronic SDH includes head injury, subdural effusion, cerebrospinal fluid leakage, and spontaneous intracranial hypotension, especially in young-aged to middle-aged patients, even without preceding trauma or hematological disorders.

Surgery is the best treatment option for chronic SDH involving moderate-to-large hematoma with accompanying neurological deficits. The ideal treatment strategy should be tailored to the individual patient's condition. Careful supportive treatment can be considered if it is well-tolerated.

In the present case, SDH was not diagnosed at our initial impression due to the lack of neurological deficits and trauma history. A patient with SDH may also initially present withdrawn behavior, absence of speech, apathy, blunted affect, and poor self-care, which may be thought to be manifestations of psychosis. Moreover, in many cases of chronic SDH, reversible Parkinson-like symptoms are the acute presenting feature. These symptoms may be misleading in patients with underlying psychiatric disorders who are taking antipsychotic medication because such movement disturbances are a common concern in patients who use antipsychotics.

### Pathophysiology of antipsychotic drug-induced movement disorders [^1163vzLk]. Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

Explaining the underlying mechanisms of antipsychotic drug-induced movement disorders remains a substantial challenge. The association of atypical antipsychotic agents with fewer drug-induced movement disorders than conventional agents has engendered several pathophysiologic hypotheses:

- **Hypothesis 1**: Unlike conventional antipsychotic agents, atypical antipsychotics have greater activity in blocking serotonin-2A (5-HT(2A)) receptors than dopamine-2 (D(2)) receptors, which mitigates extrapyramidal symptoms.

- **Hypothesis 2**: Atypical antipsychotics block D(2) receptors only long enough to cause an antipsychotic action, but not as long as conventional agents.

- **Hypothesis 3**: In tardive dyskinesia, the nigrostriatal dopamine receptor system might develop increased sensitivity to dopamine as a result of treatment with conventional antipsychotic drugs, but this may not occur with atypical antipsychotics.

- **Hypothesis 4**: There might be a genetic association in tardive dystonia relating to the dopamine D(3) allele.

A number of factors contribute to the difficult task of gaining insight into the pathophysiologic processes of antipsychotic agents and why these agents may lead to drug-induced movement disorders.

### Extrapyramidal symptoms following administration of oral perphenazine 4 or 8 mg: an 11-year retrospective analysis [^11775Ma9]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2014). Low credibility.

Perphenazine is a treatment option in postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) prophylaxis. Chronic administration and high doses are known to cause extrapyramidal system (EPS) dysfunction at a frequency of 8%, but the incidence of acute EPS following a single 4 or 8 mg dose is unknown.

- **Objective**: A retrospective analysis of patient medication billing data and departmental quality records was performed (January 2001 to 10 July 2012) to identify patients who experienced EPS dysfunction after oral perphenazine.

- **Design**: A retrospective analysis.

- **Setting**: Surgical outpatients presenting to any one of 10 hospitals in the area of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA.

- **Patients**: Overall, 45,766 patients received 4 or 8 mg of perphenazine before same-day surgery.

- **Main outcome measures**: EPS dysfunction was defined as acute dystonia, akathisia, or pseudoparkinsonism. Records were reviewed to determine the likely number of reactions to perphenazine, the nature of these reactions, and the impact on patient care.

- **Results**: There were four 'likely' cases of EPS dysfunction and two 'possible' cases. Five reported events were consistent with akathisia, while the sixth was a dystonic reaction. All six patients had resolution of symptoms, with five receiving intravenous diphenhydramine for treatment. The incidence of EPS dysfunction was 1.3 events per 10,000 patients (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.4 to 3.0, based on six events). All patients who experienced reactions pre-operatively were able to proceed to surgery without complications or delay. One patient required unplanned admission.

### Aristada Initio [^113gz4jQ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

In a schizophrenia efficacy study involving aripiprazole lauroxil-treated patients, the incidence of other extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS)-related events, excluding akathisia and restlessness, was 5% and 7% for patients on 441 mg and 882 mg, respectively, versus 4% for placebo-treated patients.

- **Dystonia**: Symptoms of dystonia, which involve prolonged abnormal contractions of muscle groups, may occur in susceptible individuals during the first few days of treatment. Dystonic symptoms include spasm of the neck muscles, sometimes progressing to tightness of the throat, swallowing difficulty, difficulty breathing, and/or protrusion of the tongue. While these symptoms can occur at low doses, they are more frequent and severe with high potency and higher doses of first-generation antipsychotic drugs. An elevated risk of acute dystonia is observed in males and younger age groups.

- **Other adverse reactions observed in clinical studies with aripiprazole lauroxil**: The following listing does not include reactions:
	- Already listed in previous tables or elsewhere in labeling
	- For which a drug cause was remote
	- Which were so general as to be uninformative
	- Which were not considered to have significant clinical implications
	- Which occurred at a rate equal to or less than placebo

	- **Cardiac**: Angina pectoris, tachycardia, palpitations
	- **Gastrointestinal disorders**: Constipation, dry mouth
	- **General disorders**: Asthenia
	- **Musculoskeletal**: Muscular weakness
	- **Nervous system disorders**: Dizziness
	- **Psychiatric disorders**: Anxiety, suicide

### Genotype, extrapyramidal features, and severity of variant ataxia-telangiectasia [^1174o6XZ]. Annals of Neurology (2019). Low credibility.

Three distinct patterns of neurological deficits were observed. The neurological features and treatments in each group are summarized in Supplementary Table 2.

- **Group A (predominant cerebellar ataxia and/or peripheral neuropathy with minimal or no extrapyramidal involvement)**: Nineteen individuals (33%) were in Group A. Severe oculomotor dyspraxia was common, occurring in 11 of 19 patients (58%), while 6 patients had mild eye movement abnormalities (32%). A 15-year-old with mild disease had normal eye movements. Another patient with normal eye movements initially presented with a severe reaction to radiotherapy for breast cancer and had a mild phenotype consisting of peripheral neuropathy with only minimal limb ataxia. Disease severity was moderate or severe, except in the individual described above and 2 pediatric patients aged 11 and 15 years. Mean disease duration was 32 years.

- **Group B (disability determined by a mixture of ataxia and/or peripheral neuropathy plus additional extrapyramidal features)**: Twenty-eight individuals (49%) were in Group B. Their extrapyramidal features included dystonic posturing/neck dystonia (12 patients), dystonic tremor (11 individuals), choreiform movements (9 patients), and orofacial dystonia (5 patients). Two patients had a resting tremor. In this group, 12 of 28 (43%) exhibited prominent oculomotor dyspraxia, 43% had mildly abnormal eye movements, and 4 patients had normal eye movements. Disease severity was widely distributed. Six individuals had mild disease, 15 had moderate disease, and 4 individuals were severely affected.

### Benztropine mesylate [^1139jdN9]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

In treating extrapyramidal disorders induced by neuroleptic drugs (e.g. phenothiazines), the recommended dosage of benztropine mesylate is 1 to 4 mg administered parenterally once or twice daily. Dosage must be individualized according to the needs of the patient, as some may require more than recommended while others need less.

- **Acute dystonic reactions**: In acute dystonic reactions, 1 to 2 mL of the injection usually relieves the condition quickly. When extrapyramidal disorders develop soon after initiation of treatment with neuroleptic drugs, they are likely transient. Administering 1 to 2 mg of benztropine mesylate two or three times a day typically provides relief within one or two days. After one or two weeks, the drug should be withdrawn to determine the continued need for it. If such disorders recur, benztropine mesylate can be reintroduced.

Certain drug-induced extrapyramidal disorders that develop slowly may not respond to benztropine mesylate. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration.

### Movement disorders associated with neuroleptic treatment [^111XS5dZ]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

Neuroleptic-induced movement disorders, or extrapyramidal side effects (EPS), can be classified into acute and tardive syndromes. Among the former are parkinsonism, dystonia, and akathisia. Conventional neuroleptics that have traditionally been used to treat psychiatric disorders are often associated with EPS. The newer atypical antipsychotics provide a more promising treatment strategy for psychiatric disorders and have a lower potential for producing EPS than conventional neuroleptics.

### Acute dyskinetic reaction in a healthy toddler following methylphenidate ingestion [^113saCoP]. Pediatric Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

Acute dyskinetic or dystonic reactions are a long-recognized complication of medications that alter dopamine signaling. Most reactions occur following exposure to agents that block dopamine receptors (e.g. neuroleptics). However, agents that increase dopaminergic transmission, such as methylphenidate, can also trigger acute dyskinesias. This has been previously reported only in patients also taking dopamine antagonists or, less commonly, in children with developmental abnormalities.

- **Case description**: The present report describes a previously healthy toddler who developed transient torticollis and orolingual dyskinesias following accidental exposure to methylphenidate. He had no preexisting movement disorder, central nervous system injury, or developmental abnormalities — in short, none of the previously reported risk factors for this side effect.

- **Hypothesis and conclusions**: The unique features of this case led to the hypothesis that developmental shifts in dopamine signaling were the basis for his particular sensitivity to methylphenidate. If confirmed, this hypothesis has implications for the treatment of common childhood attentional and behavioral disorders. The article includes a literature review of dyskinetic/dystonic reactions in children and the developmental regulation of dopamine metabolism.

Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) is a potentially lethal adverse drug reaction that affects 0.2% to 3.2% of psychiatric inpatients. Despite being a well-recognized condition, the pathogenesis of NMS is not fully understood. Although many risk factors have been identified, predicting which patients will develop NMS and when, remains extremely difficult. We report a case of NMS and discuss possible aetiologies with reference to the existing literature.

### NLX-112 randomized phase 2A trial: Safety, tolerability, anti-dyskinetic, and anti-parkinsonian efficacy [^116KHNbf]. Movement Disorders (2025). Low credibility.

- **Primary objective**: The primary objective was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of NLX‐112 compared with placebo during 8 weeks of daily treatment in people with Parkinson's (PwP) with Levodopa-induced dyskinesia (LID). Safety/tolerability assessments included physical examination (screening and follow-up); 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG, all clinic visits); vital signs (all clinic visits); frequency, intensity, and seriousness of adverse events (AEs, from baseline visit through follow-up visit); assessment of suicidal ideation/behavior by the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (CSSRS, all clinic visits); and clinical labs (hematology, blood chemistry, and urinalysis, all clinic visits). All subjects who were recruited into the trial were included in the Full Analysis Set (FAS) for safety and tolerability assessment.

- **Secondary objectives**: The secondary objective was to assess the preliminary efficacy of NLX‐112 in reducing troublesome LID and examine its effects on Parkinson's disease (PD) symptoms. The efficacy dataset included those subjects who completed the trial according to protocol (Per Protocol Set, PPS). PwP were rated for LID at baseline and on days 28 (end of up-titration period) and 42 (end of stable dosing period). Because the level of dyskinesia experienced by PwP can vary over time, they were given 150% of their regular levodopa dose (up to a maximum of 250 mg) as a challenge 30 minutes before each dyskinesia assessment to improve comparability between visits. The levodopa challenge was administered 2–2.5 hours after the subjects' regular morning dose or, for PwP receiving levodopa infusion, after interrupting infusion for 15–30 minutes.

### Chronic subdural haematoma mimicking extrapyramidal symptoms [^1169nTfQ]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). Low credibility.

Extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) are among the most common adverse effects observed in patients taking antipsychotics. Also referred to as drug-induced movement disorders, the symptoms of EPS include dystonia, akathisia, and Parkinsonism. Furthermore, prolonged use of antipsychotics can lead to tardive dyskinesia. Drug-induced EPS results from antagonism of dopamine D2 receptors, which is a primary action of antipsychotics, especially in first-generation drugs such as haloperidol and fluphenazine. While blocking D2 receptors in the mesolimbic pathway can improve psychotic symptoms, blockage of the same receptors in the nigrostriatal pathway may result in the unwanted effects of EPS. When the blockage becomes long term, overexpression of downstream D2 receptors may occur to compensate for the lack of dopamine, clinically manifesting as tardive dyskinesia.

Treatment usually includes discontinuing the antipsychotics or prescribing anticholinergics such as biperiden or trihexyphenidyl. EPS can severely impact the patient's quality of life and is one of the major reasons for patients discontinuing pharmacotherapy, which can directly increase the risk of relapse and rehospitalisation. Managing EPS is a significant part of clinical practice and a familiar scenario in psychiatry. However, medication is not the only cause of EPS. Organic brain injuries, for instance, may mimic such symptoms. Given the potentially lethal nature of brain injuries, timely and correct identification of the cause of symptoms is crucial. Reported here is a case…

### Olanzapine [^115nW15m]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

The study focused on treatment-emergent extrapyramidal symptoms assessed in a fixed-dose, placebo-controlled clinical trial of intramuscular olanzapine for injection, targeting agitated patients with schizophrenia. Below are the findings:

- **Table 19: Treatment-emergent extrapyramidal symptoms by rating scales**
	- *Percentage of patients with a Simpson-Angus Scale total score > 3.*
	- †Percentage of patients with a Barnes Akathisia Scale global score ≥ 2.

The following sections outline the percentage of patients with treatment-emergent extrapyramidal symptoms, derived from spontaneously reported adverse reactions in the same controlled clinical trial:

- **Table 20: Treatment-emergent extrapyramidal symptoms by adverse reactions**
	- **Patients with the following COSTART terms were counted in this category**: dystonia, generalized spasm, neck rigidity, oculogyric crisis, opisthotonos, torticollis.*
	- **†Patients with the following COSTART terms were counted in this category**: akinesia, cogwheel rigidity, extrapyramidal syndrome, hypertonia, hypokinesia, masked facies, tremor.
	- **‡Patients with the following COSTART terms were counted in this category**: akathisia, hyperkinesia.
	- **§Patients with the following COSTART terms were counted in this category**: buccoglossal syndrome, choreoathetosis, dyskinesia, tardive dyskinesia.
	- **Patients with the following COSTART terms were counted in this category**: movement disorder, myoclonus.

This structured approach to assessing extrapyramidal symptoms enhances the understanding of olanzapine's impacts in the clinical setting, providing crucial information for clinicians.

### Neurobiological mechanisms associated with antipsychotic drug-induced dystonia [^114V9ndm]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2021). Low credibility.

Pharmacological themes that could be implemented are as follows: (a) the efficacy of drugs antagonizing muscarinic receptors in acute and, to a lesser extent, tardive dystonia; (b) the relationship of both types of dystonia with extensive, fluctuating activities of dopamine D2 receptors; (c) the increased vulnerability for acute dystonia induced by recent cocaine abuse; (d) the action mechanisms of drugs used to treat other dystonias, such as intrathecal baclofen or botulinum A toxin; and (e) the distribution and expression of pharmacological targets in motor extrapyramidal circuitry. A remaining problem is that dystonia can also occur during treatment with drugs other than antipsychotics, and that primary and secondary movement disorders have a heterogeneous character, with different genetic, biochemical, neurophysiological, and pharmacological aspects, which do not immediately suggest a single pathophysiological mechanism. Striatal cholinergic dysfunction is a unifying theme in the pathophysiology of dystonia, but this is, of course, not independent from the efficacy of anticholinergic treatment. Researchers have tried to create a unified dystonia pathophysiology model. Their simplistic model describes underlying defects of basal ganglia function which result in increased cortical excitability, misprocessing of sensory feedback, and aberrant cortical plasticity. With important adaptations, this model can be applied to the explanation of drug-induced dystonia. Moreover, dystonia is best conceptualized as a motor circuit disorder rather than an abnormality.

### Fluphenazine hydrochloride [^116jWX87]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2020). High credibility.

The side effects most frequently reported with phenothiazine compounds are extrapyramidal symptoms, including pseudoparkinsonism, dystonia, dyskinesia, akathisia, oculogyric crises, opisthotonos, and hyperreflexia. Most often, these extrapyramidal symptoms are reversible; however, they may be persistent. With any given phenothiazine derivative, the incidence and severity of such reactions depend more on individual patient sensitivity than on other factors, but dosage level and patient age are also determinants.

Extrapyramidal reactions may be alarming, and the patient should be forewarned and reassured. These reactions can usually be controlled by the administration of antiparkinsonian drugs, such as benztropine mesylate or intravenous caffeine and sodium benzoate injection, and by subsequent reduction in dosage.

- **Extrapyramidal symptoms**: Symptoms of dystonia, prolonged abnormal contractions of muscle groups, may occur in susceptible individuals during the first few days of treatment. Dystonic symptoms include spasm of the neck muscles, sometimes progressing to tightness of the throat, swallowing difficulty, difficulty breathing, and/or protrusion of the tongue. While these symptoms can occur at low doses, they occur more frequently and with greater severity with high potency and at higher doses of first-generation antipsychotic drugs. An elevated risk of acute dystonia is observed in males and younger age groups.

- **Tardive dyskinesia**: The syndrome is characterized by involuntary choreoathetoid movements. Please refer to the WARNINGS section for more information.

### Comparison of treatment-emergent extrapyramidal symptoms in patients with bipolar mania or schizophrenia during olanzapine clinical trials [^112iX1zd]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2006). Low credibility.

Previous research on pharmacotherapy with conventional antipsychotics has suggested that patients with affective disorders have higher rates of treatment-emergent extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) than patients with schizophrenia. It is not known whether this differential vulnerability holds true for treatment with atypical antipsychotics such as olanzapine.

The present analysis retrospectively examined olanzapine clinical trial data for the incidence of treatment-emergent EPS in patients with either schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. Study participants were 4,417 patients meeting DSM-III or DSM-IV criteria for either schizophrenia or bipolar mania participating in olanzapine clinical trials through July 31, 2001. Data were pooled across haloperidol-controlled trials and separately across placebo-controlled trials. Measures of EPS included rates of treatment-emergent EPS adverse events by type (i.e. dystonic, parkinsonian, or residual), Simpson-Angus Scale score mean change, rates of treatment-emergent parkinsonism, and rates of anticholinergic use.

Consistent with prior research, haloperidol-treated patients with bipolar disorder appeared to be more vulnerable to the development of EPS than those with schizophrenia. However, olanzapine-treated patients with bipolar disorder were no more likely to develop EPS than those with schizophrenia.

Results support previous research regarding conventional antipsychotics and suggest that olanzapine therapy does not increase the risk of EPS for patients with bipolar disorder.

### Seroquel XR [^113MSNMr]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

At the end of treatment, the mean change from baseline in the SAS total score and BARS Global Assessment score was similar across the treatment groups. The use of concomitant anticholinergic medications was infrequent and consistent across the treatment groups. The incidence of extrapyramidal symptoms was in line with those observed with the profile of Seroquel in schizophrenia patients.

- **Dystonic events**: These included nuchal rigidity, hypertonia, dystonia, muscle rigidity, and oculogyration.
- **Parkinsonism**: Symptoms included cogwheel rigidity, tremor, drooling, and hypokinesia.
- **Akathisia**: Included psychomotor agitation.
- **Dyskinetic events**: Comprised tardive dyskinesia, dyskinesia, choreoathetosis.
- **Other extrapyramidal events**: Included restlessness, extrapyramidal disorder, and movement disorder.

In a placebo-controlled clinical trial for the treatment of bipolar mania, using a dosage range of 400–800 mg/day of Seroquel XR, the incidence of adverse reactions related to EPS was 6.6% for Seroquel XR compared to 3.8% in the placebo group. In this study, the occurrence of individual adverse reactions — akathisia, extrapyramidal disorder, tremor, dystonia, restlessness, and cogwheel rigidity — did not exceed 2.0% for any reaction.

### Gimoti [^11356zuX]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

Metoclopramide can lead to several disorders across various systems:

- **Central nervous system disorders**: Tardive dyskinesia, acute dystonic reactions, drug-induced parkinsonism, akathisia, and other extrapyramidal symptoms may occur. Convulsive seizures and hallucinations have also been reported. Restlessness, drowsiness, fatigue, and lassitude were observed in approximately 10% of patients taking metoclopramide orally at 10 mg four times daily. Insomnia, headache, confusion, dizziness, or depression with suicidal ideation occurred less frequently. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome and serotonin syndrome (when combined with serotonergic agents) are additional concerns.

- **Endocrine disorders**: These include fluid retention secondary to transient elevation of aldosterone, galactorrhea, amenorrhea, gynecomastia, and impotence secondary to hyperprolactinemia.

- **Cardiovascular disorders**: Patients may experience acute congestive heart failure, possible atrioventricular block, hypotension, hypertension, supraventricular tachycardia, bradycardia, and fluid retention.

- **Gastrointestinal disorders**: Nausea and bowel disturbances, primarily diarrhea, have been reported.

- **Hepatic disorders**: Hepatotoxicity is a risk, characterized by jaundice and altered liver function tests, especially when metoclopramide is administered with other drugs known for hepatotoxic potential.

- **Hematologic disorders**: Agranulocytosis, neutropenia, leukopenia, methemoglobinemia, and sulfhemoglobinemia are possible side effects.

- **Hypersensitivity reactions**: These reactions may include bronchospasm, particularly in patients with a history of asthma, as well as urticaria, rash, angioedema, including glossal or laryngeal edema.

### Compro [^113VQrCT]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Overdosage involves primarily the extrapyramidal mechanism, producing some of the dystonic reactions previously described. Symptoms may include central nervous system depression to the point of somnolence or coma, as well as agitation and restlessness. Additional manifestations can include convulsions, EKG changes, cardiac arrhythmias, fever, and autonomic reactions such as hypotension, dry mouth, and ileus.

- **Treatment**: It is crucial to determine other medications taken by the patient due to the common practice of multiple-dose therapy in overdosage situations. Treatment is essentially symptomatic and supportive. Early gastric lavage is beneficial. Keep the patient under observation and maintain an open airway, as involvement of the extrapyramidal mechanism may lead to dysphagia and respiratory difficulty in severe overdosage. Do not attempt to induce emesis because a dystonic reaction of the head or neck may develop, leading to aspiration of vomitus. Extrapyramidal symptoms may be treated with anti-parkinsonism drugs, barbiturates, or diphenhydramine. Refer to the prescribing information for these products. Care should be taken to avoid exacerbating respiratory depression.

	- If administration of a stimulant is deemed appropriate, amphetamine, dextroamphetamine, or caffeine with sodium benzoate is recommended. Stimulants that may provoke convulsions, such as picrotoxin or pentylenetetrazol, should be avoided.

	- In cases of hypotension, standard measures for managing circulatory shock should be initiated. If it is necessary to administer a vasoconstrictor, norepinephrine is advisable.

### Brainstem atrophy is linked to extrapyramidal symptoms in frontotemporal dementia [^116ZaDPz]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Low credibility.

Using automated image analysis tools, we discovered that bvFTD patients with EP symptoms have significant structural and metabolic differences in their brains compared to bvFTD patients without EP symptoms. Our findings could be utilized for earlier differentiation of such FTD spectrum patients from, e.g. Parkinson's disease patients, enabling early and more accurate differential diagnosis of these rare neurodegenerative diseases. Reliable early diagnosis is a crucial step in the path toward the development of disease-modifying therapies and accurate treatment of patients with these devastating diseases.

### A meta-analysis of the risk of acute extrapyramidal symptoms with intramuscular antipsychotics for the treatment of agitation [^111XhgwP]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2008). Low credibility.

We examined the evidence for a decreased risk of extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) with intramuscular second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) versus intramuscular haloperidol alone or in combination with an anticholinergic agent.

- **Data sources**: We searched MEDLINE (1950 to the present), EMBASE, and the Cochrane Database through January 16, 2008, for studies published in English of intramuscular SGAs and intramuscular haloperidol alone or in combination with an anticholinergic agent using the following drug names: ziprasidone, Geodon, olanzapine, Zyprexa, aripiprazole, Abilify, haloperidol, and Haldol. We then searched this pool of studies for trials with the terms intramuscular, IM, or injectable. Initially, we included only randomized controlled trials (RCTs). To obtain more data comparing SGAs to the combination of haloperidol and an anticholinergic, we conducted a second analysis including studies of any methodology.

- **Study selection**: Seven RCTs that compared intramuscular SGAs to intramuscular haloperidol alone were identified. However, we found only one RCT of haloperidol plus an anticholinergic. In the second analysis, we identified 18 studies, including four using haloperidol combined with promethazine (an antihistamine with anticholinergic properties).

- **Data extraction**: The primary outcome measure was acute dystonia; secondary outcome measures included akathisia, parkinsonism, or the need for additional anticholinergic medication. For RCTs, risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for each outcome.

### Scales for antipsychotic-associated movement disorders: Systematic review, critique, and recommendations [^114dbH6S]. Movement Disorders (2023). Low credibility.

Antipsychotic-associated movement disorders are common and disabling. Screening and assessment of these disorders pose challenges due to clinical heterogeneity and the differing nomenclature used by psychiatrists and neurologists.

- **Objective**: An International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society subcommittee aimed to rate the psychometric quality of severity and screening instruments for antipsychotic-associated movement disorders.

- **Methods**: Instruments for antipsychotic-associated movement disorders were reviewed using the methodology adopted by previous International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society subcommittee papers. They were classified as "recommended", "recommended with caveats", "suggested", or "listed".

- **Results**: Our review identified 23 instruments. The highest grade of recommendation, "recommended with caveats", was assigned to seven severity rating instruments: Extrapyramidal Symptoms Rating Scale, Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale, Abnormal Involuntary Movements Scale, Drug-Induced Extra-Pyramidal Symptoms Scale, Maryland Psychiatric Research Centre Involuntary Movements Scale, Simpson Angus Scale, and Matson Evaluation of Drug Side effects. Only three of these seven instruments (Drug-Induced Extra-Pyramidal Symptoms Scale, Maryland Psychiatric Research Centre, Matson Evaluation of Drug Side effects) were also screening tools. Their main caveats include insufficient demonstration of psychometric properties (internal consistency, skewing, responsiveness to change) and long administration duration. Eight "suggested" instruments did not meet requirements.

### Haldol decanoate [^117LBUeG]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

A syndrome consisting of potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic movements may develop in patients treated with antipsychotic drugs (see ADVERSE REACTIONS). Although the prevalence of the syndrome appears to be highest among the elderly, especially elderly women, it is impossible to rely upon prevalence estimates to predict, at the inception of antipsychotic treatment, which patients are likely to develop the syndrome. Whether antipsychotic drug products differ in their potential to cause tardive dyskinesia is unknown.

Both the risk of developing tardive dyskinesia and the likelihood that it will become irreversible are believed to increase as the duration of treatment and the total cumulative dose of antipsychotic drugs administered to the patient increase. However, the syndrome can develop, although much less commonly, after relatively brief treatment periods at low doses.

Tardive dyskinesia may remit, partially or completely, if antipsychotic treatment is discontinued. Antipsychotic treatment itself, however, may suppress (or partially suppress) the signs and symptoms of the syndrome and thereby may possibly mask the underlying process. The effect that symptomatic suppression has upon the long-term course of the syndrome is unknown.

Given these considerations, antipsychotic drugs should be prescribed in a manner that is most likely to minimize the occurrence of tardive dyskinesia. Chronic antipsychotic treatment should generally be reserved for patients who suffer from a chronic illness that is known to respond to antipsychotic drugs.

### Extrapyramidal stiffness in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [^112AmBvY]. Movement Disorders (2009). Low credibility.

There is accumulating evidence that ALS is a multisystem degenerative disease, raising the question of whether some symptoms are of extrapyramidal origin. The objective was to better characterize the type of stiffness in a series of ALS patients and to study correlations with balance and postural impairment. We studied ALS patients who exhibited stiffness without noticeable motor deficit in the lower limbs.

We analyzed the response to manual stretch velocity to differentiate between extrapyramidal (rigidity) or pyramidal (spasticity) stiffness, shortening reaction in the tibialis anterior muscles (abolished in pyramidal diseases and exaggerated in extrapyramidal diseases), and balance and posture impairment (UPDRS and Berg's scale). After a preliminary inter-rater reliability study, 39 consecutive ALS patients were prospectively recruited. Each patient was randomly assigned to one of two investigators who evaluated either stiffness or balance impairment.

In the lower limbs, rigidity was observed in at least one muscle in 27 out of 39 patients (69%), and shortening reaction was exaggerated in 20 out of 39 patients (51%). Both were correlated with balance and posture impairment (UPDRS and Berg's scale, P < 0.001). This study suggests that extrapyramidal involvement plays a role in stiffness and balance impairment in a subset of ALS patients.

### Extrapyramidal side effects of antipsychotics are linked to their association kinetics at dopamine D receptors [^114c3ESA]. Nature Communications (2017). Low credibility.

Rebinding describes the ability of a drug molecule to bind to multiple receptors within a compartment before diffusing away into bulk, with the overall effect being extended target–receptor occupancy. To examine this, we utilized a model of an immunological synapse with a compartment volume of 0.176 μm³, which is within the range described for the dopamine synapse. In this model, the overall macroscopic reversal rate (k_r) is described by the following equation: where k_off = dissociation rate from the receptor, k_on = association rate onto the receptor, R = surface receptor density fixed at 1 × 10¹¹ cm⁻², and k_- = the diffusion rate out of the synaptic compartment into bulk aqueous, fixed at 1.2 × 10⁻⁵ cm s⁻¹. All data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 6.0.

To explore the role of kinetics in determining on-target side effect liability, we correlated the kinetic values determined in this study with published clinical data taken from a comprehensive meta-analysis of clinically used antipsychotic drugs (APDs) performed by Leucht and colleagues. The majority of studies covered in the Leucht et al. meta-analysis included chronically ill patients with a history of APD exposure and the potential for modified D₂R availability. To address this, we repeated the above analysis with reported data from available multiple-treatments studies in early psychosis patients who entered studies with minimal exposure to APDs. Odds ratios for APD-induced extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) relative to spontaneous EPS in untreated patients were calculated.

### Gimoti [^114inarW]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

In addition to tardive dyskinesia (TD), metoclopramide may cause other extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), parkinsonian symptoms, and motor restlessness. Advise patients to seek immediate medical attention if such symptoms occur and to discontinue Gimoti.

Extrapyramidal symptoms, such as acute dystonic reactions, occurred in patients treated with oral metoclopramide dosages of 30 mg to 40 mg daily. Such reactions occurred more frequently in adults less than 30 years of age and at higher than recommended dosages. EPS occurred more frequently in pediatric patients compared to adults (Gimoti is not approved for use in pediatric patients). Symptoms can occur in the first 24 to 48 hours after starting metoclopramide and included involuntary movements of limbs and facial grimacing, torticollis, oculogyric crisis, rhythmic protrusion of tongue, bulbar type of speech, trismus, or dystonic reactions resembling tetanus. Rarely, dystonic reactions were present as stridor and dyspnea, possibly due to laryngospasm. Diphenhydramine hydrochloride or benztropine mesylate may be used to treat these adverse reactions. Avoid Gimoti in patients receiving other drugs that can cause EPS (e.g. antipsychotics).

Parkinsonian symptoms, including bradykinesia, tremor, cogwheel rigidity, and mask-like facies, have occurred after starting metoclopramide. These symptoms appear more commonly within the first 6 months but can also manifest after longer periods. Generally, symptoms have subsided within 2 to 3 months after discontinuation of metoclopramide. Avoid Gimoti in patients with Parkinson's disease.

### Thioridazine hydrochloride [^113cVs8h]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

Extrapyramidal symptoms: Akathisia, agitation, motor restlessness, dystonic reactions, trismus, torticollis, opisthotonus, oculogyric crises, tremor, muscular rigidity, and akinesia.

- **Tardive dyskinesia**: Chronic use of antipsychotics may be associated with the development of tardive dyskinesia. The salient features of this syndrome are described in the WARNINGS section and subsequently.

	- This syndrome is characterized by involuntary choreoathetoid movements, which variously involve the tongue, face, mouth, lips, or jaw (e.g. protrusion of the tongue, puffing of cheeks, puckering of the mouth, chewing movements), as well as the trunk and extremities. The severity of the syndrome and the degree of impairment produced vary widely.

	- The syndrome may become clinically recognizable either during treatment, upon dosage reduction, or upon withdrawal of treatment. Movements may decrease in intensity and may disappear altogether if further treatment with antipsychotics is withheld. It is generally believed that reversibility is more likely after short rather than long-term antipsychotic exposure. Consequently, early detection of tardive dyskinesia is important.

	- To increase the likelihood of detecting the syndrome at the earliest possible time, the dosage of the antipsychotic drug should be reduced periodically (if clinically possible) and the patient observed for signs of the disorder. This maneuver is critical, as antipsychotic drugs may mask the signs of the syndrome.

### Brainstem atrophy is linked to extrapyramidal symptoms in frontotemporal dementia [^1135GwGQ]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Low credibility.

Extrapyramidal (EP) symptoms are a known feature in a subpopulation of patients with behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD). Concomitant EP symptoms with FTD-like neuropsychiatric symptoms are also core features in progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and corticobasal degeneration (CBD), complicating the early diagnosis of these disorders. Our retrospective register study aimed to discover imaging (MRI and FDG-PET) biomarkers to differentiate PSP, CBD, and bvFTD patients with extrapyramidal symptoms (EP +) from bvFTD patients without EP symptoms (EP−).

The records of 2751 patients were screened for the diagnoses and presence of EP symptoms. A total of 222 patients were submitted to imaging analysis, and applicable imaging data were recovered from 139 patients. Neuroimaging data were analyzed using Freesurfer software. In the whole cohort, EP + patients showed lower volumes of gray matter compared to EP− patients in the putamen (p = 0.002), bilateral globus pallidum (p = 0.002, p = 0.042), ventral diencephalon (p = 0.002), and brainstem (p < 0.001). In the bvFTD subgroup, there was a volumetric difference between EP + and EP− patients in the brainstem. FDG-PET scans in the bvFTD patient subgroup showed that EP + patients had comparative hypometabolism of the superior cerebellar peduncle (SCP) and the frontal lobes.

We discovered that EP symptoms are linked to brainstem atrophy in bvFTD patients and the whole cohort. Furthermore, there was evident hypometabolism in the SCP of bvFTD EP + patients compared to bvFTD EP− patients. This could indicate that the EP symptoms are associated with these neuroanatomical changes.

### Drug-induced dyskinesia in Parkinson's disease: Should success in clinical management be a function of improvement of motor repertoire rather than amplitude of dyskinesia [^114GPPAz]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

- **Overview**: Drug-induced dyskinesia is a significant complication of Parkinson's disease treatment. It raises the question of whether successful clinical management should focus more on the improvement of the motor repertoire's quality rather than simply reducing dyskinesia amplitude.

- **Management strategies**: Effective management may require a comprehensive approach that balances medication regimens to optimize motor function while minimizing side effects. It is essential to consider both motor capabilities and the overall quality of life for those affected by Parkinson's disease.

- **Clinical implications**: Continuous research and clinical trials are necessary to develop therapeutic interventions that align with this focus. Collaborations between researchers, clinicians, and patients play a crucial role in advancing treatment methodologies.

This structure provides a clear and organized description while maintaining the rigorous academic tone necessary for research discussions within the context of Parkinson's disease.

### Switching antipsychotic therapy: What to expect and clinical strategies for improving therapeutic outcomes [^115sw5hH]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2007). Low credibility.

When a patient taking an antipsychotic is not experiencing symptomatic remission or is experiencing adverse effects (AEs) that are intolerable or damaging to their physical health, a change in medication may be the best path to a good outcome. However, many clinicians are reluctant to switch medications except in the clearest cases of failure. This reluctance is intensified by the occurrence of AEs caused by transitioning patients too rapidly between agents with different receptor-binding profiles. Emergent antipsychotic-switching syndromes include the "withdrawal triad", comprised of cholinergic rebound, supersensitivity psychosis, and emergent withdrawal dyskinesias (and other motor syndromes). More recently, another element consistent with an activation syndrome has been observed. This syndrome may occur as a consequence of switching from highly sedative agents or due to initial prodopaminergic drive. All of these effects can be minimized by careful planning of gradual switch procedures and judicious use of adjunctive medications.

### Prevalence of spontaneous movement disorders (dyskinesia, parkinsonism, akathisia and dystonia) in never-treated patients with chronic and first-episode psychosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111479Uq]. BMJ Mental Health (2024). Low credibility.

To address the high degree of heterogeneity, particularly in SD and SP data, we used clustering and outlying study diagnostic algorithms to identify and remove potential outliers.

Four studies in the SD data and four studies in the SP data showed outlying effect sizes, meaning that their CIs did not overlap with the CI of the pooled estimate. We also excluded three experimental design studies (two RCTs and one open-label study) due to possible selection bias differences compared with observational studies included in this review. Subsequently, the overall pooled prevalence of SD decreased to 6%, whereas for SP, it increased to 16% as demonstrated in Table 2.

*Table 2: Results of sensitivity analysis for SD and SP data.*

We also performed influential study diagnostics to identify studies with a large impact on the pooled effect or heterogeneity. This additional analysis identified no studies as influential in the dyskinesia data and only one study in the parkinsonism data. Removing it did not result in any significant changes in the overall pooled prevalence, either individually or in combination with identified outliers, as demonstrated in Table 2. However, it is noteworthy that both the I² and prediction intervals decreased, particularly in the SP data, but remained substantial in SD data. Finally, supporting the findings of high heterogeneity, we observed the presence of several distinct clusters within each dataset, indicating the existence of more than one 'population' within the pooled data, warranting subgroup comparisons and further exploration.

### Antipsychotic dose reduction compared to dose continuation for people with schizophrenia [^112Pw859]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). High credibility.

It is possible to score the potential relationship of the side effect with the treatment as "improbable", "possible", or "probable". There are also two global ratings according to the judgment of the patient and physician about the influence of the side effects on daily functioning, ranging from 0 ("no side effects") to 3 ("side effects that interfere markedly with the patient's performance"), as well as the consequences of the side effects, from 0 ("no action") to 3 ("discontinuation of drug or change to another preparation"). These domains of the UKU were not considered in the systematic review.

One study used the UKU [Huhn 2020]. There is also a self-rated version of the scale [Lindström 2001], but none of the included studies used it.

- **Liverpool University Neuroleptic Side Effect Rating Scale (LUNSERS) (Day 1995)**: LUNSERS is a self-rated scale consisting of 41 items regarding antipsychotic-related side effects (e.g. extrapyramidal, autonomic, psychic, anticholinergic, allergic reactions, and prolactin-related effects). There are also 10 additional items concerning symptoms not directly related to antipsychotic side effects, used as red herrings to indicate the accuracy of self-assessment. Each item can be scored on a 5-point Likert scale from 0 ("not at all") to 4 ("very much"). A total score is calculated by summing the scores of the 41 items, with a higher score indicating greater severity of side effects. One study used LUNSERS [Wunderink 2007].

- **Simpson and Angus Scale (SAS) (Simpson 1970)**: SAS is a clinician-rated scale that measures extrapyramidal side effects focusing on the severity of these symptoms.

### Pimozide [^115imHGm]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2017). Low credibility.

Adverse reactions

- **General**: Neuromuscular (extrapyramidal) reactions during the administration of pimozide have been reported frequently, often during the first few days of treatment. In most patients, these reactions involved Parkinson-like symptoms which were usually mild to moderately severe and reversible when first observed. Other types of neuromuscular reactions, such as motor restlessness, dystonia, akathisia, hyperreflexia, opisthotonos, and oculogyric crises, have been reported far less frequently. Severe extrapyramidal reactions have been reported to occur at relatively low doses. Generally, the occurrence and severity of most extrapyramidal symptoms are dose-related since they occur at relatively high doses and have been shown to disappear or become less severe when the dose is reduced. Administration of antiparkinson drugs, such as benztropine mesylate or trihexyphenidyl hydrochloride, may be required for control of such reactions. It should be noted that persistent extrapyramidal reactions have been reported, and the drug may need to be discontinued in such cases.

- **Withdrawal emergent neurological signs**: Generally, patients receiving short-term therapy experience no problems with abrupt discontinuation of antipsychotic drugs. However, some patients on maintenance treatment experience transient dyskinetic signs after abrupt withdrawal. In certain of these cases, the dyskinetic movements are indistinguishable from the syndrome described below under "Tardive Dyskinesia", except for duration.

### Reply to 'Antipsychotics with similar association kinetics at dopamine Dreceptors differ in extrapyramidal side-effects' [^111n75mL]. Nature Communications (2018). Low credibility.

The final comment raised by Zeberg and Sahlholm relates to the antipsychotic thioridazine, which they state has a favorable EPS profile despite its rapid association rate. Note that this drug was not included in the meta-analysis of Leucht et al, so it could not be included in our correlation. As discussed in our paper, it was not our intention to present the rebinding hypothesis as the only mechanism that might predict EPS. Rather, many antipsychotics display complex polypharmacology that may also contribute to their relative efficacy and side-effect profiles. For example, the superior EPS profile of thioridazine may relate to off-target activity at the muscarinic M1 receptor.

Our study revealed a compelling correlation between EPS and association rate, and we propose a mechanism of drug-rebinding that can explain this correlation. Given the complex action of antipsychotic drugs, it would, however, be naive to expect that all drugs would fall within this correlation. Those that do not may act via distinct mechanisms. Indeed, in our study, we observed that aripiprazole, a drug that acts as a D2R partial agonist rather than an antagonist, was an outlier. We proposed that this was because of its distinct action at the D2R.

As such, we feel that one should not discount the potential importance of drug rebinding at the D2R due to a small number of drugs that do not fit this correlation. Instead, just as the work of Seeman and colleagues stimulated our study, we hope that our work will inspire future studies aimed at carefully testing our hypothesis and unraveling the complex mechanisms involved.

### Movement disorders associated with atypical antipsychotic drugs [^1133GxDo]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2002). Low credibility.

Data from clinical trials reviewed in this article fulfill predictions based on preclinical findings that atypical antipsychotic drugs are associated with a reduced potential for inducing extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) and other movement disorders. Atypical drugs have been shown to reduce all subtypes of acute EPS, the frequency of EPS-related patient dropouts, and the need for concomitant antiparkinsonian drug use. Clozapine remains superior to other atypicals in treating psychosis without worsening motor symptoms in patients with Parkinson's disease. Atypicals may be selectively advantageous in treating schizophrenic patients with a predisposition to catatonia. Although the risk of developing lethal neuroleptic malignant syndrome may be diminished with atypical drugs, clinicians must remain alert to the signs of this disorder. Atypicals have reduced liability for inducing tardive dyskinesia (TD) and show antidyskinetic properties in patients with preexisting TD. Passive resolution of TD may be facilitated in some patients by the use of these agents. Thus, the risk of movement disorders has become only one of several considerations in choosing among antipsychotic drugs.

### Oculogyric crisis in a patient taking metoclopramide [^114m9LQz]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

Acute dystonic reactions are extrapyramidal side effects due to the alteration of the dopaminergic–cholinergic balance in the nigrostriatum. Medication-induced acute dystonia can be a side effect of treatment with antiemetics, antipsychotics, antidepressants, antiepileptics, antimalarials, and other drugs. Such drugs produce acute dystonic reactions through a nigrostriatal dopamine D2 receptor blockade, resulting in excess striatal cholinergic output. These drug-induced side effects are dose-independent.

Metoclopramide, the most commonly prescribed antiemetic, may cause acute dystonic reactions at any age, even if used at therapeutic dosages. The incidence of these reactions secondary to metoclopramide is 0.2%, but in elderly and young patients, this incidence increases to as high as 25%. Metoclopramide-induced side effects are also known to appear more frequently in female patients, at high drug doses, in patients with a family history of neurological disease, in those treated with neuroleptics, and in patients whose family members have developed acute dystonic reactions due to metoclopramide.
