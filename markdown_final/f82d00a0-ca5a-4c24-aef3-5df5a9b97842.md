## Question

hydrochlorothiazide worsen diabetes?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether hydrochlorothiazide worsens diabetes. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the distinction between worsening glycemic control in existing diabetes versus increasing incident diabetes. Then, I should verify the magnitude of these effects from trials and meta-analyses. Next, I will examine mechanistic plausibility, especially the role of hypokalemia. After that, I need to review risk modifiers such as dose, combination therapy, and patient phenotype. Finally, I will weigh the cardiovascular risk–benefit balance and translate this into practical monitoring and mitigation strategies with guideline alignment.

> Let me first confirm the scope. Worsening diabetes could mean higher fasting glucose or HbA1c in someone with established diabetes, whereas "causing diabetes" refers to new-onset type 2 diabetes in previously nondiabetic patients; both phenomena have been reported with thiazides and I need to keep them analytically distinct as I proceed [^112bxNNg] [^115LaeMY].

> Now, I should review direct evidence on glycemic worsening with HCTZ. The FDA labeling for hydrochlorothiazide and multiple combination products repeatedly notes that thiazides can cause hyperglycemia and may unmask latent diabetes, and that insulin or oral agent requirements may need adjustment, which is a clear signal of clinically relevant glycemic effects in patients with diabetes [^113spn7Y] [^112ka17T] [^111KnrZj]. Hold on, let me verify whether randomized data corroborate this; indeed, studies and reviews document that HCTZ can raise fasting glucose and worsen insulin sensitivity, including reports of increased hepatic triglycerides and reduced insulin sensitivity versus ARB comparators, supporting a metabolic cost signal beyond the label warnings [^113ifMgr] [^112i81Rx].

> Next, I should review incident diabetes data. The ALLHAT trial showed a 48% higher incidence of diabetes with chlorthalidone compared with lisinopril, and although that is not HCTZ per se, it is a thiazide-type diuretic and supports a class signal. Meta-analytic and network meta-analytic syntheses likewise associate thiazides with increased incident diabetes compared with several comparators, with the signal emerging within months of initiation [^115LaeMY] [^112bxNNg]. Wait, let me verify the time course; Shafi et al. reported a near-doubling of diabetes risk with chlorthalidone versus placebo in year 1 with a number needed to harm around 29, which aligns with the early risk period seen in SHEP and related analyses, suggesting the effect manifests early and may attenuate thereafter in some cohorts [^115LaeMY] [^117Fq1re].

> I will now examine mechanisms, because plausibility strengthens inference. Hypokalemia appears central: thiazides reduce serum potassium, and each 0.5 mEq/L fall in potassium has been associated with a roughly 45% higher adjusted diabetes risk; potassium depletion impairs beta-cell insulin secretion, and HCTZ has also been linked to hepatic steatosis and reduced insulin sensitivity, with increases in free fatty acids and enhanced hepatic gluconeogenesis proposed as contributory pathways [^117Fq1re] [^113ifMgr] [^112i81Rx]. Hold on, I should verify whether correcting potassium reverses the signal; PATHWAY-3 demonstrated that amiloride, a potassium-sparing diuretic, prevented thiazide-induced glucose intolerance and that the combination of amiloride plus HCTZ preserved potassium and improved blood pressure more than HCTZ alone, supporting a potassium-mediated mechanism and a practical mitigation strategy [^1115xKsJ] [^1138QmrN].

> Let me consider the magnitude and clinical significance. Meta-analysis estimates a mean increase in fasting plasma glucose of about 0.20 mmol/L (about 3.6 mg/dL) with thiazides, which might seem modest. However, in patients with borderline glycemia or high risk phenotypes, this shift can push individuals across diabetes thresholds, and the relative risk increase for incident diabetes with thiazides is on the order of 20–50% in several analyses, with the highest risk concentrated early after initiation [^114AxSA7] [^112bxNNg] [^115LaeMY]. I should double-check that this aligns with trial timing. Yes, SHEP-era and subsequent analyses show the excess diabetes risk clusters in year 1, consistent with a potassium-driven, early effect [^117Fq1re].

> Next, I should review modifiers of risk. Dose matters: higher thiazide doses worsen metabolic effects, whereas low-dose strategies (for example, 12.5–25 mg HCTZ or equivalent) attenuate but do not eliminate risk. Combining with a potassium-sparing agent such as amiloride or an ACE inhibitor/ARB mitigates hypokalemia and glycemic worsening. Patient phenotype also matters, with greater susceptibility in those with metabolic syndrome, central adiposity, or impaired fasting glucose, and in older adults [^115LaeMY] [^1115xKsJ] [^113SDYtt]. Wait, let me verify the combination data; trials and mechanistic reviews suggest ARB plus thiazide combinations blunt thiazide-induced insulin secretory impairment compared with thiazide plus CCB, reinforcing the value of RAS blockade when a thiazide is necessary [^116pKzUB] [^113SDYtt].

> I need to ensure the cardiovascular risk–benefit context is clear. Thiazides reduce stroke, heart failure, and major cardiovascular events, and in many patients with diabetes the absolute cardiovascular benefit of blood pressure lowering outweighs the metabolic harm; moreover, thiazide-associated incident diabetes does not consistently translate into higher cardiovascular event rates when diabetes is detected and treated, though vigilance is warranted [^114mNn5J] [^1151vjBr] [^116244a9]. But wait, what if drug selection can preserve benefits while limiting metabolic harm? Observational and trial syntheses suggest thiazide-like agents such as chlorthalidone and indapamide may have stronger outcome data and less unfavorable metabolic profiles at low doses than HCTZ, and contemporary multispecialty guidance often prefers chlorthalidone or indapamide over HCTZ when a diuretic is indicated in high-risk metabolic patients, while still advocating for the lowest effective dose and close monitoring [^117732q3] [^113SDYtt] [^113kU6z3].

> Let me translate this into practical management. For patients with established diabetes starting HCTZ, I should confirm baseline electrolytes and fasting glucose/HbA1c, recheck potassium and glucose within 3–6 months given the early risk window, and if potassium falls or glucose rises, consider potassium repletion, switching to or adding a potassium-sparing diuretic such as amiloride, or preferentially using an ACE inhibitor or ARB backbone to mitigate hypokalemia and glycemic drift. If HCTZ is essential for blood pressure control, I should use the lowest effective dose and avoid combining with beta-blockers that further impair glucose metabolism when alternatives exist [^115LaeMY] [^1115xKsJ] [^113SDYtt] [^116fnCYd]. Hold on, I should verify guideline alignment; JNC 8 and ESC/ESH endorse thiazide-type diuretics as acceptable first-line options in diabetes when clinically indicated, but emphasize careful selection, dosing, and monitoring, and many endocrine and cardiometabolic guidelines lean toward RAS blockade first with thiazide-like agents preferred if a diuretic is needed [^114PEbtH] [^115DXsN4] [^113kU6z3].

> In summary, I should confirm the bottom line. Yes, hydrochlorothiazide can worsen diabetes control and increase the risk of new-onset diabetes, primarily via hypokalemia-mediated impairment of insulin secretion and possibly via effects on hepatic steatosis and insulin sensitivity. The effect is dose related, emerges early, and is modifiable by potassium-sparing strategies and careful monitoring, while the cardiovascular benefits of thiazide-based blood pressure lowering often outweigh the metabolic risks when diabetes is recognized and managed proactively [^113spn7Y] [^117Fq1re] [^1115xKsJ] [^112bxNNg] [^114mNn5J] [^113ifMgr] [^112i81Rx].

Hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) can **worsen glycemic control** in patients with diabetes by increasing insulin resistance and reducing insulin secretion, mainly via hypokalemia [^11355Z1u] [^117Fq1re]. The risk is **dose-dependent and higher with long-term use** [^115LaeMY], especially when combined with beta-blockers [^116fnCYd]. Clinically significant hyperglycemia can occur within weeks to months [^115LaeMY], so monitor glucose and potassium closely and consider potassium-sparing agents or lower doses to mitigate risk [^1115xKsJ] [^113spn7Y].

---

## Mechanisms of hyperglycemia induced by hydrochlorothiazide

Several mechanisms explain how HCTZ **worsens glycemic control**:

- **Hypokalemia**: HCTZ-induced potassium loss impairs pancreatic beta-cell insulin secretion, increasing insulin resistance and hyperglycemia [^115LaeMY] [^117Fq1re].

- **Increased hepatic gluconeogenesis**: Hypokalemia stimulates hepatic glucose production, further elevating blood glucose [^notfound].

- **Reduced insulin sensitivity**: HCTZ may directly impair insulin sensitivity, worsening glycemic control [^113ifMgr].

---

## Clinical evidence of hyperglycemia associated with hydrochlorothiazide

Multiple studies and meta-analyses demonstrate a **consistent association** between HCTZ and hyperglycemia:

- **ALLHAT trial**: Chlorthalidone (a thiazide-like diuretic) increased incident diabetes by 48% vs lisinopril [^115LaeMY].

- **Meta-analysis**: Thiazides increase fasting plasma glucose by ~4.8 mg/dL vs non-thiazide agents or placebo [^115LaeMY].

- **PATHWAY-3 trial**: Amiloride (potassium-sparing) prevented HCTZ-induced glucose intolerance, supporting hypokalemia as a key mechanism [^1115xKsJ].

---

## Risk factors for hyperglycemia with hydrochlorothiazide

Certain factors **increase the risk** of HCTZ-related hyperglycemia:

- **Dose and duration**: Higher doses and prolonged use increase risk [^115LaeMY].

- **Combination therapy**: Beta-blockers amplify thiazide-induced hyperglycemia [^116fnCYd].

- **Patient characteristics**: Older age, obesity, metabolic syndrome, and baseline glucose intolerance heighten risk [^116244a9].

---

## Clinical implications and management strategies

Given the risk of hyperglycemia, **clinicians should**:

- **Monitor glucose and potassium**: Check baseline and periodic glucose and potassium during therapy [^113spn7Y].

- **Use the lowest effective dose**: Prefer ≤ 25 mg daily when possible [^112zhQcD].

- **Consider potassium-sparing agents**: Amiloride or spironolactone can mitigate hypokalemia and hyperglycemia [^1115xKsJ] [^1173y6gF].

- **Adjust antihyperglycemic therapy**: Titrate insulin or oral agents as needed if hyperglycemia occurs [^112ka17T].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Guidelines acknowledge **thiazide-induced hyperglycemia** but still support thiazides for hypertension management when indicated. ESC/ESH 2018 recommends **thiazide/thiazide-like diuretics** as part of combination therapy, with attention to metabolic effects and potassium monitoring [^115DXsN4]. JNC 8 includes thiazides as first-line options, including in patients with diabetes, with monitoring for metabolic effects [^114PEbtH]. AACE 2023 advises caution with thiazides in patients at risk for diabetes and recommends monitoring for **hyperglycemia and electrolyte disturbances** [^1119ouhn].

Hydrochlorothiazide can **worsen glycemic control** in patients with diabetes through hypokalemia-mediated effects on insulin secretion and sensitivity. The risk is dose- and duration-dependent and amplified by beta-blocker co-therapy. Clinicians should monitor glucose and potassium, use the lowest effective dose, and consider potassium-sparing agents to reduce risk [^115LaeMY] [^1115xKsJ].

### Effect of amiloride, or amiloride plus hydrochlorothiazide, versus hydrochlorothiazide on glucose tolerance and blood pressure (PATHWAY-3): a parallel-group, double-blind randomised phase 4 trial [^116sh9oQ]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2016). Medium credibility.

The short duration of the study also limits our ability to explain why potassium-sparing and potassium-losing diuretics have opposing effects on blood glucose. On several measures — insulin concentrations, HbA 1c, and the calculated homoeostatic model assessments of insulin secretion and resistance — we found no differences between groups. Good control of blood pressure and the high prevalence of ACE inhibitors or ARBs in our study population probably mitigated the rise in 2 h blood glucose in the hydrochlorothiazide group, despite the high proportion of patients with central adiposity. But results in the amiloride group — in which there were seemingly contrary trends for HbA 1c and 2 h glucose concentrations — show previously noted limitations of using HbA 1c as a surrogate of glucose intolerance. Thus, the adverse effect of spironolactone on glucose tolerance, which was imputed from a similar small rise in HbA 1c, could possibly be an artifact. The mechanism to explain why HbA 1c does not accurately reflect glucose intolerance in this setting can only be speculated, but perhaps redistribution and reduction of blood supply by diuretics affects red cell disposal and hence the turnover of HbA 1c. A final limitation is that we enrolled patients with an increased likelihood of developing glucose intolerance. The beneficial effects of amiloride might be less certain or applicable in thinner patients.

### Do thiazides worsen metabolic syndrome and renal disease? The pivotal roles for hyperuricemia and hypokalemia [^114ZiVb2]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The aims of this article are to review the current controversies related to the use of thiazide diuretics as first-line treatment of hypertension and to discuss the causal roles for hyperuricemia and hypokalemia on the adverse consequences of thiazide usage.

Recent Findings

Thiazides significantly reduce morbidity and mortality in hypertensive subjects. There remains, however, debate about thiazide usage as first-line treatment of hypertension. This negative impact of thiazides may be partially attributed to the ability of thiazides to exacerbate features of metabolic syndrome or increase the risk for developing diabetes. Several clinical trials suggest that thiazide-induced hyperuricemia and hypokalemia may account for some of these negative effects. Thiazide treatment is also associated with a decline of renal function in spite of a lowering blood pressure. In this review, we discuss the clinical and experimental evidence supporting a potential role of hyperuricemia and hypokalemia on the development of renal injury and worsening of the metabolic syndrome.

Summary

Hyperuricemia and hypokalemia may have pivotal roles in the exacerbation of the metabolic syndrome in response to thiazides. We propose that controlling serum uric acid and serum potassium could improve thiazide efficacy and also reduce its risk for inducing metabolic syndrome or diabetes.

### Differences in glucose tolerance between fixed-dose antihypertensive drug combinations in people with metabolic syndrome [^115gaoxb]. Diabetes Care (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

We sought to test the hypothesis that a fixed-dose combination of trandolapril/verapamil-SR (T/V) is superior to a fixed-dose combination of losartan/hydrochlorothiazide (L/H) on glucose tolerance in hypertensive patients with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT).

Research Design and Methods

A prospective, randomized, open-label, blinded-end points design was used to assess the effects of a T/V versus L/H combination in patients with IGT and hypertension (n = 240) followed for up to 1 year. Doses were titrated to a systolic blood pressure < 130 mmHg. Primary outcome was change from baseline in a 2-h glucose on oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) at study end (mean [± SD] at follow-up, 46.9 ± 13.5 weeks). Secondary outcomes included changes in insulin sensitivity, office and 24-h ambulatory blood pressure, incidence of new-onset diabetes, lipids, and inflammatory markers. Data are expressed as means ± SE unless otherwise noted.

Results

Changes at study end were noted in 2-h OGTT glucose (T/V -0.21 ± 0.36 vs. L/H +1.44 ± 0.36 mmol/l; P < 0.001) and insulin level (-30.13 ± 38.38 vs. +84.86 ± 38.33 pmol/l, respectively; P = 0.025). Worsening of insulin resistance occurred by week 12 (T/V 0.000 ± 0.001 vs. L/H -0.005 ± 0.001; P = 0.016). A higher incidence of new-onset diabetes (T/V 11.0 vs. L/H 26.6%; P = 0.002) and HbA1c > 7% (2.6 vs. 9.6%, respectively; P = 0.05) occurred at study end.

Conclusions

In patients with IGT, normal kidney function, and hypertension, the fixed-dose combination of T/V reduces the risk of new-onset diabetes compared with an L/H-based therapy.

### Diabetes and cardiovascular disease: from evidence to clinical practice-position statement 2014 of Brazilian diabetes society [^113mCeaT]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2014). Low credibility.

- A meta-analysis of 5 trials, both observational and randomized clinical trial, including 7,312 patients with diabetes showed that intensive treatment with a reduction in systolic BP to below 130 mmHg vs. reduction of systolic BP to below 140 mmHg showed reduction of the risk of stroke but not in mortality or in acute myocardial infarction.

2.600000000000000e+01 Due to the similarity of benefit in cardiovascular outcomes, it is recommended that the decision in the choice of initial drug therapy, including the major classes of antihypertensive drugs, is based on tolerability, cost, and presence of comorbidities. Regarding renal protection, ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers are superior. [LEVEL A]

Summary of evidence:

- A meta-analysis of 27 randomized trials with 158,709 patients including 33,395 patients with diabetes, the options of diuretics, calcium dihydropyridine blockers, ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) were equally effective in reducing cardiovascular events in subjects with or without diabetes.

- A meta-analysis including 63 randomized controlled trials with 36,917 patients with diabetes compared different antihypertensive drugs versus placebo. ACE inhibitors have consistently shown higher probability in being superior compared to other antihypertensive drugs in relation to renal outcomes, mortality from all causes, onset of dialysis or doubling of creatinine. The meta-analysis also demonstrated superiority of ACE inhibitors in relation to reno-protection, with similar benefit when ARBs are used.

2.700000000000000e+01 In the need of using more than one antihypertensive to achieve target blood pressure, it is preferably recommended the association between an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor with a dihydropiridin calcium blocker. [LEVEL A]

Summary of evidence:

- The randomized ACCOMPLISH trial included 11,506 patients with high blood pressure and with cardiovascular high risk, including 60% of patients with diabetes. These patients were randomly assigned to associations to receive benazepril plus amlodipine or benazepril plus hydrochlorothiazide for 36 months. The study showed that the combination benazepril plus amlodipine is superior to the combination of benazepril plus hydrochlorothiazide in reducing the risk of cardiovascular events and mortality (reduction of relative risk of 19.6% p < 0.001). Subgroup analysis showed that patients with diabetes had similar benefits as the non diabetic patients.

### Hydrochlorothiazide and triamterene (triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide) [^115NQnH9]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

Diabetes

Caution should be exercised when administering triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide capsules to patients with diabetes, since thiazides may cause hyperglycemia, glycosuria and alter insulin requirements in diabetes. Also, diabetes mellitus may become manifest during thiazide administration.

Impaired Hepatic Function

Thiazides should be used with caution in patients with impaired hepatic function. They can precipitate hepatic coma in patients with severe liver disease. Potassium depletion induced by the thiazide may be important in this connection. Administer triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide capsules cautiously and be alert for such early signs of impending coma as confusion, drowsiness and tremor; if mental confusion increases discontinue triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide capsules for a few days. Attention must be given to other factors that may precipitate hepatic coma, such as blood in the gastrointestinal tract or preexisting potassium depletion.

Hypokalemia

Hypokalemia is uncommon with triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide capsules; but, should it develop, corrective measures should be taken such as potassium supplementation or increased intake of potassium-rich foods. Institute such measures cautiously with frequent determinations of serum potassium levels, especially in patients receiving digitalis or with a history of cardiac arrhythmias. If serious hypokalemia (serum potassium less than 3.0 mEq/L) is demonstrated by repeat serum potassium determinations, triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide capsules should be discontinued and potassium chloride supplementation initiated. Less serious hypokalemia should be evaluated with regard to other coexisting conditions and treated accordingly.

Electrolyte Imbalance

Electrolyte imbalance, often encountered in such conditions as heart failure, renal disease or cirrhosis of the liver, may also be aggravated by diuretics and should be considered during triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide therapy when using high doses for prolonged periods or in patients on a salt-restricted diet. Serum determinations of electrolytes should be performed, and are particularly important if the patient is vomiting excessively or receiving fluids parenterally. Possible fluid and electrolyte imbalance may be indicated by such warning signs as: dry mouth, thirst, weakness, lethargy, drowsiness, restlessness, muscle pain or cramps, muscular fatigue, hypotension, oliguria, tachycardia and gastrointestinal symptoms.

### Use of diuretics to treat hypertension in diabetic persons… [^112zhQcD]. AAFP (2004). Low credibility.

I am aware of the guidelines on offering diuretics as first-line therapy. However, I must take issue with the authors' assertion that diuretics should be the first or second drug administered for the control of hypertension in patients who have diabetes. It has been long established that diuretics, especially thiazide diuretics, adversely affect glucose metabolism. Although lower doses of these medications have less of an adverse effect, many of these patients have more severe hypertension that requires maximal dosing of treatment strategies. 2 The use of this class of medications can worsen glucose control unnecessarily because other treatment options exist. in reply: Dr. Hood raises an excellent point regarding thiazide diuretics and blood glucose control. This is an area of much controversy. The recommendations of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure.

1 and the American Diabetes Association 2 advocate the use of thiazide diuretics in patients who have hypertension and diabetes. The highest dosages of thiazide diuretics used in the 16 major clinical trials published since 1990 were 25 mg of chlorthalidone or hydrochlorothiazide. 3 In a meta-analysis, 4 an average 1 percent elevation in blood glucose levels was seen in patients taking thiazide diuretics at these dosages; this does not represent a clinically significant increase in most patients with diabetes. 4 Dosages above 25 mg appear to contribute only to increases in adverse effects such as hypokalemia, and not to further improvements in blood pressure control.

In terms of efficacy, thiazide diuretics have demonstrated the same or greater benefits on long-term outcomes of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease in patients with diabetes as in those who do not have diabetes, reflecting the higher cardiovascular risk seen in patients with diabetes. 2, 5 In the Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial, patients who had diabetes had fewer cardiovascular events with diuretic treatment than with ACE inhibitor treatment. With the current dosages of thiazide diuretics being used in practice, the negative effect of the small increases in blood glucose levels is overshadowed by the beneficial effects seen in clinical trials using thiazides as part of the multidrug regimen that is required to achieve blood pressure control in most patients with diabetes.

### Impact of chronic diuretic treatment on glucose homeostasis [^115M8HJm]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Hypertension affects up to 60% of patients with type 2 diabetes. It has been reported that the concomitance of hypertension and diabetes roughly doubles the risk of cardiovascular events. Indeed, treatment of hypertension with diuretics has often been attributed to increased insulin resistance and accelerated onset of diabetes. It has also been reported that hypertension often precedes the onset of diabetes, suggesting that anti-hypertensive treatment with diuretics may contribute to the development of abnormal glucose tolerance, thus offsetting the benefits of the treatment in terms of cardiovascular risk. Furthermore, the use of diuretics, particularly thiazide, has also been associated with unfavorable alterations in other cardiovascular risk factors, such as uric acid and cholesterol concentrations.

Despite these negative effects, it has been recommended that treatment of hypertension be prioritized and stressed in persons with type 2 diabetes, where first choice agents may include thiazide diuretics. In fact, the trend of the use of diuretics, especially that of thiazides, is continually increasing. Present guidelines indicate thiazides as first-line therapy in hypertension, but also suggest that their use as first step drugs be limited in the treatment of diabetic patients. Furthermore, the impact of anti-hypertensive treatment with diuretics on insulin resistance and glycemia in people without known diabetes and/or atherosclerotic diseases is still a matter of debate.

Therefore, we investigated the associations between diuretic treatment for hypertension and different markers of metabolic and cardiovascular risk in a cohort of randomly selected adults without known diabetes and/or atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.

### Redefining diuretics use in hypertension: why select a thiazide-like diuretic? [^112Bad6D]. Journal of Hypertension (2019). Medium credibility.

Mortality

With respect to mortality, results of meta-analyses are particularly noteworthy as they are consistently different between thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics. In the Olde Enberink et al. meta-analysis, treatment with thiazide-like diuretics, but not thiazides, resulted in a significant reduction in all-cause mortality compared with placebo [RR 0.84 (95% CI: 0.74–0.96), no adjustment for blood pressure; Table 4). In the 2015 meta-analysis by Thomopoulos et al. (N = 195 267), only treatment with indapamide significantly reduced all-cause mortality [RR 0.86 (95% CI: 0.75–0.99), no adjustment for blood pressure].

These opposing effects on mortality raise an important question about heterogeneity and the interpretation of meta-analyses that combine data for thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics. In the elderly, anti-hypertensive treatment has been reported to have no effect on mortality; but authors also report significant heterogeneity because of HYVET, which was the only indapamide trial and the only trial to show an improvement in mortality risk. In diabetic patients, no effect of diuretic treatment on mortality was found in several meta-analyses. However, in the diabetes sub-analysis of the placebo-controlled SHEP trial (n = 1226) significant improvements in cardiovascular and all-cause mortality were noted after chlorthalidone treatment [adjusted hazard ratio 0.69 (95% CI: 0.53–0.85) for cardiovascular mortality and 0.81 (95% CI: 0.68–0.95) for total mortality]). These data, thus, suggest that combining of data from thiazide-like and thiazide diuretics may mask differences between these two classes of diuretics.

### The diabetogenic potential of thiazide-type diuretic and β-blocker combinations in patients with hypertension [^116fnCYd]. Journal of Hypertension (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Recently published trials addressing the pharmacological management of hypertension have reported an increase in new-onset diabetes mellitus when comparing certain older and newer treatment regimens. Thiazide-type diuretics (thiazides) and beta-blockers have been individually implicated, but these drugs are frequently combined, and the magnitude of risk associated with their combined use has not been quantified.

Methods and Results

Randomized control trials were retrieved that: (i) featured stepped treatment to manage hypertension; (ii) compared initial treatment using a thiazide or beta-blocker (older drug) with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, angiotensin receptor blocker or calcium antagonist (newer drug); (iii) assessed cardiovascular outcomes; (iv) reported new-onset diabetes; and (v) provided at least 1-year follow-up. A meta-analysis of available trials indicated that patients exposed to treatment regimens combining thiazides and beta-blockers are at greater risk of developing diabetes than regimens avoiding this combination of drugs (risk ratio for alternative therapy 0.81, 95% confidence interval 0.77–0.86). Current data cannot inform reliably about the risks associated with individual older drugs because of similar overall exposures in patients starting on newer and older drugs.

Interpretation and Implications

The results suggest that the routine combined use of a thiazide with a beta-blocker should be questioned in the early management of hypertension, particularly in patients who are at increased risk of developing new-onset diabetes. In such patients, the increased risk of developing diabetes may exceed the benefit of blood pressure lowering.

### Olmesartan medoxomil-hydrochlorothiazide [^113vADBC]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal.

Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy.

Olmesartan medoxomil and hydrochlorothiazide may be used alone, or in combination with other antihypertensive drugs.

Olmesartan medoxomil and hydrochlorothiazide is a combination of olmesartan, an angiotensin II receptor blocker and hydrochlorothiazide, a thiazide diuretic indicated for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. (1)

### Effect of amiloride, or amiloride plus hydrochlorothiazide, versus hydrochlorothiazide on glucose tolerance and blood pressure (PATHWAY-3): a parallel-group, double-blind randomised phase 4 trial [^1138QmrN]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2016). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Diuretics have been used as the control drug in many large hypertension studies, but have rarely in the past 10 years been the main target of interest or studied in maximally efficacious doses. Our study provides answers to several questions about diuretics that had not been previously investigated or resolved. We showed that, after 24 weeks of treatment, a potassium-sparing diuretic reduces blood pressure as efficaciously as high-dose thiazide without inducing adverse effects on blood glucose concentrations. Furthermore, a combination of half the conventional doses of amiloride and hydrochlorothiazide was not associated with increased 2 h glucose concentrations compared with hydrochlorothiazide treatment alone but produced significantly larger reductions in blood pressure than full doses of either diuretic given alone. Amiloride monotherapy did not cause clinically significant hyperkalaemia, and the amiloride–hydrochlorothiazide combination did not significantly affect potassium concentrations.

Hitherto, the mechanism and prospects for prevention of thiazide-induced glucose intolerance were uncertain; the role of potassium in this problem was also unclear. A National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute working party in 2008 identified potassium as "perhaps the most attractive variable" in developing a hypothesis for the mechanism of the thiazide response, and called for studies of potassium-sparing diuretics, among others. Amiloride has been licensed for hypertension for almost as long as hydrochlorothiazide, but has rarely been used or studied in doses that lower blood pressure as effectively as high-dose thiazides or other diuretic classes. That matched doses of thiazides and potassium-sparing diuretics, with similar efficacy on blood pressure, could neutralise the undesirable effects of each class while synergising to enhance reduction of blood pressure was an attractive hypothesis, but there were many unknowns, such as whether amiloride — in the context of blockade of the RAS in most patients — could be safely used at a dose large enough to match the blood pressure reduction of hydrochlorothiazide without causing hazardous electrolyte abnormalities.

### Angiotensin receptor blocker / diuretic combination preserves insulin responses in obese hypertensives [^116pKzUB]. Journal of Hypertension (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Thiazide diuretics can impair glucose metabolism and increase new-onset diabetes. Adding an angiotensin receptor blocker to diuretics may protect against these metabolic effects; however, the mechanism of this protection is unclear.

Method

To explore potential mechanisms, a 16-week multicenter trial was conducted to ascertain the relative glucose metabolism effects of combined hydrochlorothiazide and angiotensin receptor blocker (valsartan) therapy compared with hydrochlorothiazide and calcium channel blocker (amlodipine) treatment in 412 centrally obese hypertensive individuals (BMI = 35 ± 7 kg/m, seated BP = 159 ± 8/94 ± 8 mmHg, and mean age 56 years). Individuals were randomized to valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide, with force-titration to 320/25 mg or hydrochlorothiazide, with titration to hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg and amlodipine 10 mg, respectively. Changes from baseline to week 16 in fasting and 2-h postprandial glucose and insulin levels after an oral glucose load were measured.

Results

At week 16, clinic blood pressure reductions were similar (P > 0.05) in both groups. Fasting and 2-h glucose levels increased (P < 0.05) with the amlodipine combination but not with the valsartan combination. In concert with these glucose responses, postprandial insulin increases from baseline were substantially greater with valsartan than with amlodipine plus hydrochlorothiazide group (P = 0.001). The glucose responses were inversely related to insulin responses at the study conclusion.

Conclusion

The novel observation of this investigation was that the combination of valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide was associated with greater glucose-stimulated insulin secretory and lesser glycemic excursion responses than the amlodipine combination group. Thus, this data suggests that adding an angiotensin receptor blocker attenuates the negative effects of thiazides on pancreatic beta-cell glucose-induced insulin secretion.

### Spironolactone and hydrochlorothiazide [^1121eUPP]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Essential hypertension:

For patients with essential hypertension in whom other measures are considered inadequate or inappropriate;
In hypertensive patients for the treatment of a diuretic-induced hypokalemia when other measures are considered inappropriate;
Spironolactone and hydrochlorothiazide tablets are indicated for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes, including the classes to which this drug principally belongs. There are no controlled trials demonstrating risk reduction with spironolactone and hydrochlorothiazide tablets.

Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than one drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program's Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC).

Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly.

Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal.

Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy.

### Searching for optimal blood pressure targets in type 2 diabetic patients with coronary artery disease [^1151vjBr]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2019). Medium credibility.

Diuretics

Despite some concern about the increased risk for metabolic and electrolytic disturbance, diuretics are effective for the treatment of hypertension in type 2 diabetic patients. In post hoc analyses of patients with hypertension and T2DM, thiazide resulted in a significant reduction in cardiovascular events, all-cause mortality, and hospitalization for heart failure compared to placebo, and generally was shown to be non-inferior to other antihypertensive agents. Benefits attributed to thiazide diuretics in terms of cardiovascular event reduction outweigh the risk of worsening glucose control in type 2 diabetic patients. Low dose thiazides in combination with ACEI/ARB may minimize or prevent some of metabolic and electrolytic disturbance associated with diuretic therapy. Thiazide-like diuretics chlortalidone and indapamide were found to be less markedly associated metabolic abnormalities than hydrochlorothiazide but were as good as amlodipine or lisinopril in preventing fatal or non-fatal coronary artery disease and was more effective in hypertensive patients with T2DM. However, the risk of worsening glucose control in type 2 diabetes and of new-onset diabetes in non-diabetic patients correlate with thiazide treatment due to its potential to negatively influence insulin resistance. Thus, glucose and electrolytes should be monitored when initiating therapy.

β-adrenergic blockers

Hypertension is underpinned by high sympathetic nerve activity especially in younger or middle-age subjects. β-blockers reduce heart rate, decrease catecholamine-induced inflammatory reaction, and improve endothelial shear stress, which exert a beneficial effect on coronary blood flow and clinical outcomes. β-blockers are frequently used as add-on treatment in hypertensive patients with coronary artery disease, heart failure or atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. Caution should be made when they were used in patients with T2DM due to its potential adverse metabolic effects, including an increase in triglyceride levels, a decrease in HDL cholesterol levels, weight gain, masking the worsening symptoms of hypoglycemia and aggravating insulin resistance. Cavedilol with combined non-selective β and ɑ1 adrenergic antagonist actions improves survival in patients with heart failure and could not be as deleterious for glucose control.

New hypoglycemic agents

The role of certain new anti-diabetic medications including dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, glucagon like peptide 1 (GLP-1)agonists, and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT 2) inhibitors, in BP control besides their glucose lowering effects in diabetic individuals has been investigated.

6.2 Postmarketing Experience

The following additional adverse reactions have been reported in valsartan or valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide postmarketing experience. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

Hypersensitivity: Angioedema has been reported. Some of these patients previously experienced angioedema with other drugs including ACE inhibitors. Valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets should not be re-administered to patients who have had angioedema.

Digestive: Elevated liver enzymes and reports of hepatitis

Musculoskeletal: Rhabdomyolysis

Renal: Impaired renal function

Dermatologic: Alopecia, bullous dermatitis

Vascular: Vasculitis

Nervous System: Syncope

Hydrochlorothiazide:

The following additional adverse reactions have been reported in postmarketing experience with hydrochlorothiazide:

Acute renal failure, renal disorder, aplastic anemia, erythema multiforme, pyrexia, muscle spasm, asthenia, acute angle-closure glaucoma, bone marrow failure, worsening of diabetes control, hypokalemia, blood lipids increased, hyponatremia, hypomagnesemia, hypercalcemia, hypochloremic alkalosis, impotence, and visual impairment.

Pathological changes in the parathyroid gland of patients with hypercalcemia and hypophosphatemia have been observed in a few patients on prolonged thiazide therapy. If hypercalcemia occurs, further diagnostic evaluation is necessary.

Non-melanoma Skin Cancer: Hydrochlorothiazide is associated with an increased risk of non-melanoma skin cancer. In a study conducted in the Sentinel System, increased risk was predominantly for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and in white patients taking large cumulative doses. The increased risk for SCC in the overall population was approximately 1 additional case per 16,000 patients per year, and for white patients taking a cumulative dose of ≥ 50,000 mg the risk increase was approximately 1 additional SCC case for every 6,700 patients per year.

### Effect of amiloride, or amiloride plus hydrochlorothiazide, versus hydrochlorothiazide on glucose tolerance and blood pressure (PATHWAY-3): a parallel-group, double-blind randomised phase 4 trial [^117AMRD4]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2016). Medium credibility.

Glucose concentration at 2 h in the OGTT is the best single measure for prediction of the long-term development of diabetes, and is also a strong predictor of cardiovascular morbidity. Sequential OGTTs offered the possibility of testing the hypothesis that prevention of potassium depletion would protect against thiazide-induced glucose intolerance. Although some of the difference in glucose profiles between the groups was due to a progressive increase in glucose intolerance in the hydrochlorothiazide group, glucose concentrations fell significantly in the amiloride group, at least when 12 week and 24 week data were compared with baseline. The importance of even minor degrees of glucose intolerance has been long evident from the Whitehall study, which showed that, during a period of 7·5 years, mortality from coronary heart disease doubled in participants with a 2 h glucose concentration greater than 5·3 mmol/L compared with patients with 2 h concentations of less than 5·3 mmol/L.

That amiloride and hydrochlorothiazide have opposite effects on glucose tolerance is consistent with potassium depletion being the cause of the rise in blood glucose concentration in patients taking thiazide diuretics. The poor correlation in our study between plasma glucose and potassium might be related to how poorly plasma electrolytes reflect overall electrolyte balance — plasma potassium concentrations are often normal in primary aldosteronism, for example. However, we included an intermediate, combination group in the study, both to confirm the role of potassium and to investigate a treatment that could be implemented in practice. The combination group necessitated selection of doses of each drug that, unlike the available fixed-dose combinations (in which the dose of amiloride is only a tenth that of hydrochlorothiazide), were predicted to neutralise changes in potassium. If the effects on blood glucose concentrations in the combination group were, as we noted with potassium concentrations, halfway between those in the two monotherapy groups, an even larger study than PATHWAY-3 would have been needed. But our additional predictions were that blood pressure would trump other effects on blood glucose, and that combining half doses of two diuretics with different targets in the kidney would have synergistic effects on sodium excretion, hence leading to reduction in blood pressure.

### Medication-induced hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus: a review of current literature and practical management strategies [^116L6Lsv]. Diabetes Therapy (2024). Medium credibility.

The importance of monitoring for and recognizing medication-induced hyperglycemia is significant. Certain medications (e.g. antineoplastic treatment, immunosuppression in inflammatory conditions) require long-term use and have benefits that potentially outweigh the risks of hyperglycemia. Moreover, adequate management of hyperglycemia could allow for continuation of these agents. However, if left unrecognized and/or untreated, both acute and chronic (including micro- and macrovascular) complications of hyperglycemia can arise.

The exact incidence and prevalence of drug-induced hyperglycemia and diabetes are unknown as a result of limited studies, the sometimes transient nature of hyperglycemia with resolution upon discontinuation of the implicated medication, the lack of distinguishing features between naturally occurring versus medication-induced diabetes, and the lack of monitoring and testing. In addition, many individuals may have undiagnosed diabetes that comes to light when there is further worsening of hyperglycemia due to use of such medications. Finally, the occurrence of hyperglycemia and/or diabetes following the initiation of an implicated medication can range from days to years, with the dose and duration of treatment also affecting the probability of hyperglycemia. As a general overview, LaPreze and Robinson have reported the incidence of drug-induced diabetes or hyperglycemia to be 40–65% with glucocorticoid use, 10–30% with antipsychotic use, 3–17% with antiretroviral use, 0.8–1.9% with immune checkpoint inhibitors use, 63% with alpelisib use, 15–30% in transplant immunosuppression use, 10% with thiazide diuretic use, 7–48% in statin use, 6.8–19.8% in niacin use, and 22% with beta blocker use. We recognize that lack of robust, prospective, and randomized trials proving causality can often lead to wide variability of incidence with certain medications (e.g. statin therapies). Important considerations when evaluating medication-induced hyperglycemia are shown in Table 1. We would like to elaborate on some of these considerations with the following medications implicated in leading to hyperglycemia, both well-known as well as newer therapies.

### Effect of amiloride, or amiloride plus hydrochlorothiazide, versus hydrochlorothiazide on glucose tolerance and blood pressure (PATHWAY-3): a parallel-group, double-blind randomised phase 4 trial [^1115xKsJ]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2016). Medium credibility.

Background

Potassium depletion by thiazide diuretics is associated with a rise in blood glucose. We assessed whether addition or substitution of a potassium-sparing diuretic, amiloride, to treatment with a thiazide can prevent glucose intolerance and improve blood pressure control.

Methods

We did a parallel-group, randomised, double-blind trial in 11 secondary and two primary care sites in the UK. Eligible patients were aged 18–80 years; had clinic systolic blood pressure of 140 mm Hg or higher and home systolic blood pressure of 130 mmHg or higher on permitted background drugs of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin-receptor blockers, β blockers, calcium-channel blockers, or direct renin inhibitors (previously untreated patients were also eligible in specific circumstances); and had at least one component of the metabolic syndrome in addition to hypertension. Patients with known diabetes were excluded. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to 24 weeks of daily oral treatment with starting doses of 10 mg amiloride, 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide, or 5 mg amiloride plus 12·5 mg hydrochlorothiazide; all doses were doubled after 12 weeks. Random assignment was done via a central computer system. Both participants and investigators were masked to assignment. Our hierarchical primary endpoints, assessed on a modified intention-to-treat basis at 12 and 24 weeks, were the differences from baseline in blood glucose measured 2 h after a 75 g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), compared first between the hydrochlorothiazide and amiloride groups, and then between the hydrochlorothiazide and combination groups. A key secondary endpoint was change in home systolic blood pressure at 12 and 24 weeks. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00797862, and the MHRA, Eudract number 2009–010068–41, and is now complete.

Findings

Between Nov 18, 2009, and Dec 15, 2014, 145 patients were randomly assigned to amiloride, 146 to hydrochlorothiazide, and 150 to the combination group. 132 participants in the amiloride group, 134 in the hydrochlorothiazide group, and 133 in the combination group were included in the modified intention-to-treat analysis. 2 h glucose concentrations after OGTT, averaged at 12 and 24 weeks, were significantly lower in the amiloride group than in the hydrochlorothiazide group (mean difference -0·55 mmol/L [95% CI -0·96 to -0·14]; p = 0·0093) and in the combination group than in the hydrochlorothiazide group (-0·42 mmol/L [-0·84 to -0·004]; p = 0·048). The mean reduction in home systolic blood pressure during 24 weeks did not differ significantly between the amiloride and hydrochlorothiazide groups, but the fall in blood pressure in the combination group was significantly greater than that in the hydrochlorothiazide group (p = 0·0068). Hyperkalaemia was reported in seven (4·8%) patients in the amiloride group and three (2·3%) patients in the combination group; the highest recorded potassium concentration was 5·8 mmol/L in a patient in the amiloride group. 13 serious adverse events occurred but the frequency did not differ significantly between groups.

Interpretation

The combination of amiloride with hydrochlorothiazide, at doses equipotent on blood pressure, prevents glucose intolerance and improves control of blood pressure compared with montherapy with either drug. These findings, together with previous data about morbidity and mortality for the combination, support first-line use of amiloride plus hydrochlorothiazide in hypertensive patients who need treatment with a diuretic.

### The metabolic cost of lowering blood pressure with hydrochlorothiazide [^112uXxpE]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusions

We have documented that HCTZ therapy leads to the development of hepatic steatosis and compromised insulin sensitivity in subjects at high risk for type 2 diabetes. Conversely, treatment with Valsartan did not cause ectopic fat redistribution, and in fact, leads to improved insulin sensitivity. Further studies are needed to determine the exact mechanism by which HCTZ exerts its deleterious effects and whether these changes in metabolic pmeters will translate into an increase in major long-term adverse cardiovascular events. While the clinical relevance of thiazide-induced metabolic derangements remains uncertain at this time, hypertensive individuals at risk for diabetes and those with known hepatic steatosis should opt for antihypertensive agents that are metabolically benign – i.e. ARB or ACE inhibitors – until this issue is clarified.

### Diuretic treatment of hypertension [^1173y6gF]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Diuretic-induced glucose elevations

Several studies showed that use of thiazide diuretic increases glucose levels, but in these studies, the second drug was a β-blocker that impaired glucose metabolism. The Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study assessed the incidence of new-onset diabetes (NOD) after 3 and 6 years in 12,550 adults who did not have diabetes. Patients who received thiazide diuretics were not at greater risk for the subsequent development of diabetes than the subjects with hypertension who were not receiving any antihypertensive therapy. In this study, only subjects with hypertension who were taking β-blockers had a 28% higher risk of subsequent diabetes. In the ACCOMPLISH study, the effects of the two treatment arms on glucose levels were not reported. It is likely that the use of diuretics with an ACE inhibitor did not adversely affect glucose metabolism, as we have previously shown. If a high-dose diuretic has a negative effect on glucose metabolism, it may be related to hypokalemia. Analysis of the SHEP data showed that each 0.5 mEq/L decrease in serum potassium during the 1st year of treatment was associated with a 45% higher adjusted diabetes risk. Potassium supplementation or combination of thiazide with ACE inhibitor or potassium-sparing agents might prevent thiazide-induced diabetes. The combination of thiazide with aldosterone antagonist may not only prevent NOD but also improve BP control. It seems that not all diuretics are equal in regard to the effect on insulin resistance. Leonetti et al. showed that indapamide does not have a deleterious effect on glucose tolerance. The effects of diuretic-induced glucose elevation on long-term CV risk were reported in several studies. Verdecchia et al. reported a nearly threefold higher CV disease risk after 16 years of follow-up in treated patients with hypertension (54% treated with diuretics) who developed NOD; no relationship was seen between diuretic usage and CV events. In post hoc subgroup analyses of the ALLHAT data, there was no significant association of fasting glucose level change at 2 years with subsequent coronary heart disease, stroke, CV disease, total mortality, or end-stage renal disease. There was no significant association of incident diabetes at 2 years with clinical outcomes, except for coronary heart disease (risk ratio 1.64; P = 0.006), but the risk ratio was lower and nonsignificant in the chlorthalidone group (risk ratio 1.46; P = 0.14). Analysis of the 14.3 years of follow-up from the SHEP revealed that incident diabetes during the trial among participants randomized to placebo was associated with a > 50% increase in CV mortality but not in individuals randomized to the diuretic. Thus, diuretic-induced glucose changes may underline lesser prognostic significance.

### Quinapril hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide [^115ZUcUq]. FDA (2016). Low credibility.

General

Serum Electrolyte Abnormalities: In clinical trials, hyperkalemia (serum potassium ≥ 5.8 mmol/L) occurred in approximately 2% of patients receiving quinapril. In most cases, elevated serum potassium levels were isolated values which resolved despite continued therapy. Less than 0.1% of patients discontinued therapy due to hyperkalemia. Risk factors for the development of hyperkalemia include renal insufficiency, diabetes mellitus, and the concomitant use of other drugs that raise serum potassium levels.

Hydrochlorothiazide can cause hypokalemia and hyponatremia. Hypomagnesemia can result in hypokalemia which appears difficult to treat despite potassium repletion. Drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system can cause hyperkalemia. The risk of hyperkalemia may be increased in patients with renal insufficiency, diabetes mellitus or with concomitant use of drugs that raise serum potassium (see Drug Interactions). The risk of hypokalemia may be increased in patients with cirrhosis, brisk diuresis, or with concomitant use of drugs that lower serum potassium. Monitor serum electrolytes periodically.

Other Metabolic Disturbances:

Hydrochlorothiazide may alter glucose tolerance and raise serum levels of cholesterol and triglycerides.

Hydrochlorothiazide may raise the serum uric acid level due to reduced clearance of uric acid and may cause or exacerbate hyperuricemia and precipitate gout in susceptible patients.

Hydrochlorothiazide decreases urinary calcium excretion and may cause elevations of serum calcium. Monitor calcium levels in patients with hypercalcemia receiving quinapril hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide.

Cough: Presumably due to the inhibition of the degradation of endogenous bradykinin, persistent nonproductive cough has been reported with all ACE inhibitors, resolving after discontinuation of therapy. ACE inhibitor-induced cough should be considered in the differential diagnosis of cough.

Surgery/Anesthesia: In patients undergoing surgery or during anesthesia with agents that produce hypotension, quinapril will block the angiotensin II formation that could otherwise occur secondary to compensatory renin release. Hypotension that occurs as a result of this mechanism can be corrected by volume expansion.

Olmesartan medoxomil and hydrochlorothiazide tablets are a combination of olmesartan, an angiotensin II receptor blocker and hydrochlorothiazide, a thiazide diuretic indicated for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. (1)

### Diuretic treatment of hypertension [^114Yq1rA]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

Thiazide-type diuretics are at least as effective as β-blockers, calcium antagonists, and ACE inhibitors in reducing CV outcomes. Thiazide diuretics are particularly effective in preventing stroke and HF in hypertensive patients. These drugs are very effective in the elderly and very elderly patients. The combined use of thiazide-like diuretics with aldosterone antagonists may be worthwhile. Thus, diuretics should remain the leading agents in the management of hypertension. However, the statement that these drugs are superior to other drugs in almost all patients with hypertension is not supported by superiority studies. Particularly in the younger hypertensive subjects, the benefit of diuretics as first-line antihypertensive drugs should be weight against the risk of unwanted effects in the long term. This holds particularly true in subjects at high risk of developing diabetes.

### Diabetes and hypertension: the bad companions [^114mNn5J]. Lancet (2012). Excellent credibility.

High blood pressure is reported in over two-thirds of patients with type 2 diabetes, and its development coincides with the development of hyperglycaemia. Many pathophysiological mechanisms underlie this association. Of these mechanisms, insulin resistance in the nitric-oxide pathway; the stimulatory effect of hyperinsulinaemia on sympathetic drive, smooth muscle growth, and sodium-fluid retention; and the excitatory effect of hyperglycaemia on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system seem to be plausible. In patients with diabetes, hypertension confers an enhanced risk of cardiovascular disease. A blood pressure of lower than 140/85 mm Hg is a reasonable therapeutic goal in patients with type 2 diabetes according to clinical trial evidence. People with controlled diabetes have a similar cardiovascular risk to patients without diabetes but with hypertension. A renin-angiotensin system blocker combined with a thiazide-type diuretic might be the best initial antihypertensive regimen for most people with diabetes. In general, the positive effects of antihypertensive drugs on cardiovascular outcomes outweigh the negative effects of antihypertensive drugs on glucose metabolism.

### Changes in serum potassium mediate thiazide-induced diabetes [^117Fq1re]. Hypertension (2008). Low credibility.

Thiazides, recommended as first-line antihypertensive therapy, are associated with an increased risk of diabetes. Thiazides also lower serum potassium. To determine whether thiazide-induced diabetes is mediated by changes in potassium, we analyzed data from 3790 nondiabetic participants in the Systolic Hypertension in Elderly Program, a randomized clinical trial of isolated systolic hypertension in individuals aged ≥ 60 years treated with chlorthalidone or placebo. Incident diabetes was defined by self-report, antidiabetic medication use, fasting glucose ≥ 126 mg/dL, or random glucose ≥ 200 mg/dL. The mediating variable was change in serum potassium during year 1. Of the 459 incident cases of diabetes during follow-up, 42% occurred during year 1. In year 1, the unadjusted incidence rates of diabetes per 100 person-years were 6.1 and 3.0 in the chlorthalidone and placebo groups, respectively. In year 1, the adjusted diabetes risk (hazard ratio) with chlorthalidone was 2.07 (95% CI: 1.51 to 2.83; P < 0.001). After adjustment for change in serum potassium, the risk was significantly reduced (hazard ratio: 1.54; 95% CI: 1.09 to 2.17; P = 0.01); the extent of risk attenuation (41%; 95% CI: 34% to 49%) was consistent with a mediating effect. Each 0.5-mEq/L decrease in serum potassium was independently associated with a 45% higher adjusted diabetes risk (95% CI: 24% to 70%; P < 0.001). After year 1, chlorthalidone use was not associated with increased diabetes risk. In conclusion, thiazide-induced diabetes occurs early after initiating treatment and appears to be mediated by changes in serum potassium. Potassium supplementation might prevent thiazide-induced diabetes. This hypothesis can and should be tested in a randomized trial.

### Effect of amiloride, or amiloride plus hydrochlorothiazide, versus hydrochlorothiazide on glucose tolerance and blood pressure (PATHWAY-3): a parallel-group, double-blind randomised phase 4 trial [^116td22q]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2016). Medium credibility.

Plasma potassium was unchanged at 24 weeks in the combination group, whereas a significant dose-dependent rise in concentration was noted in the amiloride group (by 0·63 mmol/L [0·56 to 0·70]; p < 0·0001 at 24 weeks) and a significant fall was recorded in the hydrochlorothiazide group (by −0·27 mmol/L [–0·34 to −0·20]; p < 0·0001 at 24 weeks; figure 3B). Plasma concentrations were significantly higher at 24 weeks in both the amiloride and combination groups than in the hydrochlorothiazide group (p < 0·0001 for both when adjusted for baseline covariates; figure 3B).

Uric acid concentrations rose in the hydrochlorothiazide group but were unchanged in the amiloride group (p < 0·0001 for difference between groups; table 3, figure 3C); uric acid concentrations did not differ significantly between the hydrochlorothiazide and combination groups. Area under the curve during OGTT was significantly smaller in the amiloride group than in the hydrochlorothiazide group, but did not differ significantly between the combination and hydrochlorothiazide groups (table 3). We noted no significant differences between groups in fasting glucose, insulin (at 0 and 30 min), HbA 1c, or homoeostatic model assessment indices of insulin resistance and secretion (table 3), except for a difference between the hydrochlorothiazide and combination groups for insulin at 30 min. However, we noted a mean numerical increase across all groups in HbA 1c at both 12 weeks (0·086% [0·033–0·139], p = 0·0006) and 24 weeks (0·126% [0·082–0·170], p < 0·0001). 11 patients in the amiloride (11·8% adjusted for baseline covariates [95% CI 6·3–21·1]), nine (8·0% [3·7–16·2]) in the combination, and 13 (12·6% [6·5–23·0]) in the hydrochlorothiazide group developed diabetes during the study. Odds ratios for developing diabetes compared with the hydrochlorothiazide group were 0·65 (0·25–1·69) for the combination group and 1·07 (0·43–2·64) for the amiloride group.

### New onset diabetes during antihypertensive therapy [^114paqJU]. American Journal of Hypertension (2008). Low credibility.

New onset diabetes (NOD) is common among hypertensive patients, whether they are being treated for hypertension or not, and is associated with subsequently increased cardiovascular disease (CVD). Thiazide-like diuretics and beta-blockers are more likely to provoke hyperglycemia when compared with drugs that block the renin-angiotensin system, and calcium channel blockers. However, in contrast to the NOD arising during treatment with other antihypertensive drugs, the NOD that occurs during diuretic treatment, has not been shown to increase CVD, either in clinical trials, or during longer observational studies. In fact, blood pressure reduction achieved by diuretic treatment may avert the expected increase of CVD in NOD. Conventional blood pressure reduction (along with lipid lowering) is the proven approach to preventing CVD in diabetes, in whatever circumstances the diabetes occurs. Apprehensions relating to the potential onset of NOD should not influence the choice of the initial antihypertensive treatment choice, nor should it invariably lead to discontinuation of diuretics (although such a step may reverse hyperglycemia). NOD can also sometimes be eliminated by correcting hypokalemia with a potassium-sparing diuretic, and/or potassium supplementation, or by adding a potassium-conserving antihypertensive drug such as an ACEI, ARB, or an anti-aldosterone agent. If all these stratagems fail (or are unsuitable), and the diuretic is essential to blood pressure control, then hypoglycemic therapy is indicated. NOD does adversely affect quality of life, and is not to be accepted lightly. However, diuretic-induced hyperglycemia can be managed, and should be tolerated if a diuretic is essential for blood pressure control. In summary, the potential for occurrence of NOD certainly needs consideration, but it is not an insurmountable challenge, and must not compromise aggressive blood pressure control, which remains the primary tool for antihypertensive care.

### Redefining diuretics use in hypertension: why select a thiazide-like diuretic? [^113kU6z3]. Journal of Hypertension (2019). Medium credibility.

SELECTING THIAZIDE-LIKE DIURETICS OVER THIAZIDE DIURETICS

A number of recent guidelines, though not the most recent 2018 ESC/ESH hypertension guidelines, recommend the 'preferred' use of thiazide-like diuretics rather than thiazide diuretics (Table 1). The decision of certain guidelines to favor treatment with thiazide-like diuretics centers mainly around duration of action data, the ability to lower blood pressure, and long-term cardiovascular endpoint reduction data. Hypertension Canada, United Kingdom National Clinical Guideline Centre, and ACC/AHA hypertension guidelines currently give preference to longer acting thiazide-like diuretics (chlorthalidone and/or indapamide). In 2017, the ACC/AHA singled out chlorthalidone as the preferred diuretic treatment because of proven cardiovascular risk reduction and recommended substituting HCTZ treatment by indapamide or chlorthalidone treatment in patients with resistant hypertension. For hypertensive patients with diabetes, the American Diabetes Association gives preference to thiazide-like diuretics (chlorthalidone and indapamide) because they are longer acting diuretics that have a proven effect on cardiovascular event reduction. Differences in mechanism of action, pleiotropic effects, metabolic profiles, and subclinical markers are also cited in some guidelines. Lastly, though the 2018 ESC/ESH guidelines give equal weight in their recommendations to thiazide-like and thiazide diuretics because of a lack of head-to-head randomized controlled trials, guidelines do note that this recommendation was influenced by the fact that many of the approved single-pill combinations are based on HCTZ. These guidelines also underscore the fact that chlorthalidone and indapamide are more potent per milligram than HCTZ for blood pressure reduction.

### What is a preferred angiotensin II receptor blocker-based combination therapy for blood pressure control in hypertensive patients with diabetic and non-diabetic renal impairment? [^111SDRyo]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2012). Low credibility.

The view that thiazide diuretics reduce GFR and have lower efficacy in the renally impaired may also impact the efficacy and renoprotective outcome of combined therapy. Consequently, loop diuretics rather than thiazide diuretics are specifically recommended in patients with ESRD/proteinuria because they more readily increase diuresis at lower GFRs.

These findings suggest that a RAS blocker, combined with a CCB rather than HCTZ, may be the combination of choice for high CV risk hypertensive patients, such as those with coronary artery disease with or without stable angina, patients with a metabolic risk profile (e.g. diabetes, obesity or metabolic syndrome) and, in particular, those with renal disease. In addition, it should be noted that some data suggests thiazide diuretics may impair glucose homeostasis and that treatment is associated with a greater incidence of diabetes compared with other antihypertensives. Furthermore, compared with olmesartan/HCTZ, olmesartan/amlodipine treatment was associated beneficial metabolic and inflammatory effects and a lower-risk of new onset diabetes in non-diabetic patients with metabolic syndrome. These data reinforce the suggestion that ARB/CCB combinations may be a preferred treatment combination, especially in patients with concomitant metabolic disorders, such as diabetes.

The renoprotective effects of ARBs and ACE inhibitors are mediated via their ability to block RAS activity. This makes RAS blockers the treatment of choice in patients with diabetic kidney disease and non-diabetic kidney disease with proteinuria. For the ARBs, evidence for guideline recommendations came from a number of clinical trials (predominantly in patients with chronic kidney disease) that showed ARBs to be renoprotective, independent of their BP-lowering effects (Table 4). For example, the IRbesartan in patients with type II diabetes and MicroAlbuminuria (IRMA2) study demonstrated that irbesartan, added to other antihypertensive agents, could prevent the development of diabetic nephropathy in hypertensive patients with T2DM and persistent microalbuminuria. Also in patients with T2DM, the Irbesartan in Diabetic Nephropathy Trial (IDNT) demonstrated that irbesartan significantly reduced the risk of the composite primary endpoint of a doubling of serum creatinine, ESRD or death compared with placebo and amlodipine. Losartan also demonstrated renoprotective effects in the Angiotensin II Antagonist Losartan (RENAAL) study. In addition, the MicroAlbunuria Reduction with VALsartan (MARVAL) study showed greater reduction in urinary albumin excretion rate with valsartan than amlodipine for the same BP reduction.

### 2018 ESC / ESH guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension [^113SDYtt]. European Heart Journal (2018). Medium credibility.

Thiazide and thiazide‑like diuretics in hypertension — There has been debate about whether thiazide‑like diuretics should be preferred over classical thiazides, but superiority on outcomes has not been tested in head‑to‑head randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Chlorthalidone and indapamide are more potent per milligram than hydrochlorothiazide with a longer duration of action and no evidence of more side effects, and lower dose thiazide‑like diuretics have more RCT evidence for reductions in CV events and mortality compared with lower dose thiazide diuretics. Thiazide and thiazide‑like diuretics can reduce serum potassium and have a less favourable side‑effect profile than RAS blockers, including dysmetabolic effects that increase insulin resistance and the risk of new‑onset diabetes; addition of a potassium‑sparing diuretic may reduce adverse glucose effects. Renal function modifies efficacy: both thiazides and thiazide‑like agents are less effective with reduced kidney function and become ineffective at lower estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) thresholds (eGFR < 45 mL/min; eGFR < 30 mL/min). In such circumstances, loop diuretics such as furosemide or torasemide should replace thiazides and thiazide‑like diuretics to achieve an antihypertensive effect, and, recognizing available evidence and single‑pill combinations, we recommend that thiazides, chlorthalidone, and indapamide can all be considered suitable antihypertensive agents.

### Acute declines in estimated glomerular filtration rate in patients treated with benazepril and hydrochlorothiazide versus amlodipine and risk of cardiovascular outcomes [^1111XHFc]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Results

We included a total of 10 714 ACCOMPLISH participants for analysis, which represents 92% of the original trial cohort after excluding those with missing data (Figure S1). A total of 15.8% of individuals experienced an acute decline in eGFR over 3 months (N = 1690). The distribution of decline in eGFR is shown in Figure S2 by treatment arm.

We compared characteristics of individuals by the magnitude of the acute decline in eGFR that occurred over the first 3 months (≤ 15% versus > 15%, Table 1). We found that those with a > 15% acute decline in eGFR were older, more commonly randomized to receive hydrochlorothiazide as opposed to amlodipine, and had lower SBP at baseline and larger declines in their BP after 3 months. There was no statistically significant difference in the prevalence of baseline diabetes by the level of decline in eGFR that occurred. Those who exhibited a > 15% decline in eGFR experienced a median decrease of 16 mL/min per 1.73 m 2 (Table 1).

### Lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide [^1128t7YW]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Although any chloride deficit is generally mild and usually does not require specific treatment, except under extraordinary circumstances (as in liver disease or renal disease), chloride replacement may be required in the treatment of metabolic alkalosis.

Dilutional hyponatremia may occur in edematous patients in hot weather; appropriate therapy is water restriction, rather than administration of salt except in rare instances when the hyponatremia is life-threatening. In actual salt depletion, appropriate replacement is the therapy of choice.

Hyperuricemia may occur or frank gout may be precipitated in certain patients receiving thiazide therapy.

In diabetic patients dosage adjustments of insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents may be required. Hyperglycemia may occur with thiazide diuretics. Thus latent diabetes mellitus may become manifest during thiazide therapy.

The antihypertensive effects of the drug may be enhanced in the postsympathectomy patient.

If progressive renal impairment becomes evident consider withholding or discontinuing diuretic therapy. Thiazides have been shown to increase the urinary excretion of magnesium; this may result in hypomagnesemia.

Thiazides may decrease urinary calcium excretion. Thiazides may cause intermittent and slight elevation of serum calcium in the absence of known disorders of calcium metabolism. Marked hypercalcemia may be evidence of hidden hyperparathyroidism. Thiazides should be discontinued before carrying out tests for parathyroid function.

Increases in cholesterol and triglyceride levels may be associated with thiazide diuretic therapy.

### Triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide [^116xddYR]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Diabetes

Caution should be exercised when administering triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide capsules to patients with diabetes, since thiazides may cause hyperglycemia, glycosuria, and alter insulin requirements in diabetes. Also, diabetes mellitus may become manifest during thiazide administration.

Impaired Hepatic Function

Thiazides should be used with caution in patients with impaired hepatic function. They can precipitate hepatic coma in patients with severe liver disease. Potassium depletion induced by the thiazide may be important in this connection. Administer triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide capsules cautiously and be alert for early signs of impending coma such as confusion, drowsiness, and tremor; if mental confusion increases, discontinue triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide capsules for a few days. Attention must be given to other factors that may precipitate hepatic coma, such as blood in the gastrointestinal tract or pre-existing potassium depletion.

Hypokalemia

Hypokalemia is uncommon with triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide capsules; but, should it develop, corrective measures should be taken such as potassium supplementation or increased intake of potassium-rich foods. Institute such measures cautiously with frequent determinations of serum potassium levels, especially in patients receiving digitalis or with a history of cardiac arrhythmias. If serious hypokalemia (serum potassium less than 3 mEq/L) is demonstrated by repeat serum potassium determinations, triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide capsules should be discontinued and potassium chloride supplementation initiated. Less serious hypokalemia should be evaluated with regard to other coexisting conditions and treated accordingly.

Electrolyte Imbalance

Electrolyte imbalance, often encountered in conditions such as heart failure, renal disease, or cirrhosis of the liver, may also be aggravated by diuretics and should be considered during therapy with triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide when using high doses for prolonged periods or in patients on a salt-restricted diet. Serum determinations of electrolytes should be performed and are particularly important if the patient is vomiting excessively or receiving fluids parenterally. Possible fluid and electrolyte imbalance may be indicated by warning signs such as: dry mouth, thirst, weakness, lethargy, drowsiness, restlessness, muscle pain or cramps, muscular fatigue, hypotension, oliguria, tachycardia, and gastrointestinal symptoms.

### Cardiovascular therapies and risk for development of diabetes [^116xdL8N]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2004). Low credibility.

The prevalence of diabetes is increasing, and patients with diabetes are at increased risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes. Recently, the results from 11 large randomized clinical trials have suggested a difference in the emergence of new diabetes according to cardiovascular medication use. Treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and calcium antagonists yielded a lower incidence of diabetes development than beta-blockers and diuretics. Physicians should consider this possible diabetes consequence when prescribing long-term beta-blockers and diuretics, particularly in patients at high risk of developing diabetes.

### Telmisartan and hydrochlorothiazide [^111BKtrn]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal.

Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy [see Clinical Studies (14)].

Telmisartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets are not indicated for initial therapy for the treatment of hypertension [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].

Telmisartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents.

Telmisartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets are combination of an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) and a thiazide diuretic indicated for the treatment of hypertension, alone or with other antihypertensive agents, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. (1)

### Thiazide diuretic-induced change in fasting plasma glucose: a meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials [^114AxSA7]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Prior meta-analyses measuring thiazide-induced glycemic change have demonstrated an increased risk of incident diabetes; however, this measure's definition has changed over time.

Aim

To determine the magnitude of change in fasting plasma glucose (FPG) for thiazide diuretics.

Data Sources

A research librarian designed and conducted searches in Medline®, EMBASE, and EBM Reviews-Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (inception through July 2018) and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (inception to December 2014).

Study Selection

Randomized, controlled trials comparing a thiazide or thiazide-like diuretic to any comparator reporting FPG were identified. Trials enrolling < 50 participants, those with a follow-up period of < 4 weeks, and conference abstracts were excluded.

Data Extraction

Independent duplicate screening of citations and full-text articles, data extraction, and assessment of risk of bias was conducted.

Data Synthesis

Ninety-five studies were included (N = 76,608 participants), with thiazides compared with placebo, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system inhibitors, potassium-sparing diuretic, and others alone or in combination. Thiazide diuretics marginally increased FPG (weighted mean difference 0.20 mmol/L (95% CI 0.15–0.25); I² = 84%) (1 mmol/L = 18 mg/dL). Results did not change substantially when considering dose or duration, comparing thiazides with placebo or an active comparator, or using thiazides as monotherapy or combination therapy, even when combined with a potassium-correcting agent.

Conclusion

Thiazide diuretics have a small and clinically unimportant impact on FPG.

### Effect of amiloride, or amiloride plus hydrochlorothiazide, versus hydrochlorothiazide on glucose tolerance and blood pressure (PATHWAY-3): a parallel-group, double-blind randomised phase 4 trial [^116dCWrQ]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2016). Medium credibility.

Added value of this study

In our study we compared a potassium-sparing diuretic, a potassium-losing diuretic, and a combination of the two during 24 weeks in 441 patients who were either previously untreated or taking angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin-receptor blockers, or calcium-channel blockers. Our results supported our hypothesis that thiazide-induced glucose intolerance, as shown by 2 h glucose concentrations in oral glucose tolerance tests, would not occur in the absence of potassium depletion. Our results do not completely prove that potassium depletion causes the effect of thiazide on glucose tolerance, but show that it is possible to potentiate the benefit of two classes of diuretic on blood pressure while cancelling out undesired effects of thiazides on glucose and potassium concentrations.

Implications of all the available evidence

At an adequate dose (10–20 mg), amiloride is as efficacious as 25–50 mg hydrochlorothiazide, and is not associated with undesirable metabolic consequences. The combination of amiloride and hydrochlorothiazide was already known, from the Medical Research Council's Elderly trial and INSIGHT, to be more efficacious than comparator drugs at preventing some complications of hypertension; however, the 2·5–5 mg dose of amiloride given in these studies was inadequate to prevent hydrochlorothiazide-associated hypokalaemia or diabetes. We propose that the amiloride–hydrochlorothiazide combination tested in this study should be considered in patients taking either an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, an angiotensin-receptor blocker, or a calcium-channel blocker as a first-line treatment for hypertension.

### Quinapril hcl and hydrochlorothiazide [^112udRci]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

General

Serum Electrolyte Abnormalities: In clinical trials, hyperkalemia (serum potassium ≥ 5.8 mmol/L) occurred in approximately 2% of patients receiving quinapril. In most cases, elevated serum potassium levels were isolated values which resolved despite continued therapy. Less than 0.1% of patients discontinued therapy due to hyperkalemia. Risk factors for the development of hyperkalemia include renal insufficiency, diabetes mellitus, and the concomitant use of other drugs that raise serum potassium levels.

Hydrochlorothiazide can cause hypokalemia and hyponatremia. Hypomagnesemia can result in hypokalemia which appears difficult to treat despite potassium repletion. Drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system can cause hyperkalemia. The risk of hyperkalemia may be increased in patients with renal insufficiency, diabetes mellitus or with concomitant use of drugs that raise serum potassium (see Drug Interactions). The risk of hypokalemia may be increased in patients with cirrhosis, brisk diuresis, or with concomitant use of drugs that lower serum potassium. Monitor serum electrolytes periodically.

Other Metabolic Disturbances: Hydrochlorothiazide may alter glucose tolerance and raise serum levels of cholesterol and triglycerides.

Hydrochlorothiazide may raise the serum uric acid level due to reduced clearance of uric acid and may cause or exacerbate hyperuricemia and precipitate gout in susceptible patients.

### Losartan potassium and hydrochlorothiazide (Hyzaar) [^114zZSo6]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

1.1	Hypertension

HYZAAR®is indicated for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure lowers the risk of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular (CV) events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarction. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes including losartan and hydrochlorothiazide.

Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than 1 drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program's Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC).

Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly.

Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal.

Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in Black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy.

This fixed dose combination is not indicated for initial therapy of hypertension, except when the hypertension is severe enough that the value of achieving prompt blood pressure control exceeds the risk of initiating combination therapy in these patients [see Clinical Studies (14) and Dosage and Administration (2.1)].

HYZAAR may be administered with other antihypertensive agents.

### Demographic, environmental, and genetic predictors of metabolic side effects of hydrochlorothiazide treatment in hypertensive subjects [^113UNnh6]. American Journal of Hypertension (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Thiazide diuretics are recommended for first-line treatment of hypertension. Although considered safe and effective, their use is associated with dyslipidemia, hyperglycemia, and an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes. The aim of this study was to characterize interindividual variation in glucose and lipid responses to hydrochlorothiazide and to identify demographic, environmental, and genetic predictors associated with this variation.

Methods

A community-based sample of 585 adults with essential hypertension (291 African Americans [150 women and 141 men] and 294 non-Hispanic whites [126 women and 168 men]) underwent monotherapy with hydrochlorothiazide for 4 weeks. Linear regression was used to construct prediction models for the changes in plasma total cholesterol, triglyceride, and glucose concentrations.

Results

The mean changes (± standard deviation) in response to hydrochlorothiazide were 6.13 ± 22.8 mg/dL for total cholesterol, 17.21 ± 70 mg/dL for triglycerides, and 3.5 ± 9.5 mg/dL for plasma glucose. Ethnicity and baseline levels of the analytes were the only predictors that were significant for more than one response. Therefore, the mechanism for these metabolic effects are not entirely shared.

Conclusions

Taken together, demographic, environmental, and genetic factors accounted for only 13% of the total variation in total cholesterol response, 17% of the variation in triglyceride response, and 11% of the variation in glucose response to hydrochlorothiazide, and less than half of this predicted variation in response was explained by measured genotypes.

### Thiazide-induced glucose intolerance treated with potassium… [^111DiNFw]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Introduction Since their introduction in 1957 the thiazide drugs 1 have proved important. The early realization of the potassium-depleting potency of these drugs has necessitated supplementary potassium administration in some patients to prevent hypokalemia. Otherwise, these drugs have been relatively free of serious side effects apart from occasional drug reactions and an interesting capacity to produce hyperuricemia. 2 Recently, however, investigators 3–12 have reported diminished glucose tolerance in diabetic patients receiving thiazides. Because of the nature of their disease, diabetics represent a group in whom the thiazides have found wide usefulness. Although increased insulin requirements in diabetic patients receiving thiazides have been infrequent, laboratory evidence of altered glucose metabolism occurs commonly, and presumably diabetic control becomes tenuous with the use of thiazides.

One may, therefore, be disinclined to use these agents in support of the hypertensive or fluid and electrolyte problems in this group of patients. The mechanism of glucose. RAPOPORT MI, HURD HF. Thiazide-Induced Glucose Intolerance Treated With Potassium. Arch Intern Med. 1964; 113: 405–408.

### Association of thiazide diuretics with diabetes progression, kidney disease progression, cardiovascular outcomes, and death among patients with diabetes who initiate statins [^116Vzeuh]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Statins have been associated with diabetes mellitus (DM) progression but their cardiovascular benefit in patients with DM outweigh the harm. However, the effects of concurrent use of other medications that similarly increase blood glucose level, such as thiazide diuretics, are not well studied. This study aimed to evaluate the association of concurrent use of thiazide diuretics and statins on DM progression, cardiovascular and renal outcomes, and death in patients with DM. This is a retrospective cohort study of Veterans with DM who initiated statins between 2003 and 2015. The cohort comprised thiazide users (concomitantly used thiazides and statins for ≥ 6 months) and active comparators (concomitantly used calciun channel blockers [CCB] but not thiazides and statins for ≥ 6 months). We excluded patients who were < 18 years old, with chronic kidney disease stage 4 or worse, or used loop diuretics. We propensity-score-matched comparison groups on 99 baseline characteristics including demographics, healthcare utilization, co-morbidities, cardiovascular and co-morbidity scores, vital signs, laboratory data, and medication class usage. Outcomes were: (1) DM progression (new insulin initiation, increase in the number of glucose-lowering medication classes, and hyperglycemic episodes); (2) kidney disease progression (doubling of serum creatinine, incidence of chronic kidney disease stage 5, initiation of renal replacement therapy, and incidence of diabetic nephropathy); (3) cardiovascular outcomes (acute myocardial infarction, stroke, cardiac arrest); and (4) total mortality. From 297,967 statin users (228,509 Thiazide-statin users and 69,458 active comparators), we successfully matched 67,614 pairs. In comparison to active comparators, thiazide-statin users had increased risk of DM progression (65.6% in CCB group vs 68.1% in thiazide group; odds ratio [OR]: 1.12, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.09 to 1.15), decreased risk of kidney progression (16.9% in CCB group vs 16.5 in thiazide group; OR: 0.97, 95% CI: 0.94 to 0.99), decreased risk of cardiovascular outcomes (15.7% in CCB group vs 14.6% in thiazide group; OR: 0.92, 95% CI: 0.89 to 0.95), and similar risk of total mortality (19.7% in each group; OR: 1.00, 95% CI: 0.98 to 1.03). This study attempted to answer an important clinical question whether thiazide diuretics should be discontinued or substituted upon statin initiation. Our results showed that concurrent use of statin and thiazides in patients with DM was associated with DM progression but with less kidney progression and cardiovascular outcomes and no difference in mortality. Clinicians should closely monitor DM control when thiazides and statins are used concurrently.

### An observation of hydrochlorothiazide in diabetes insipidus… [^113ZfjXe]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

In studying a single case of the idiopathic variety of diabetes insipidus, it was found that hydrochlorothiazide, after a short latent period, brought about a marked reduction in urinary output. The patient, a 45-year-old woman, had been treated for diabetes insipidus for more than 6 years, but the antidiuretic action of injected vasopressin tannate had become unpredictable and its local side effects were the cause of concern. Orally administered hydrochlorothiazide reduced her mean daily urinary volume to 5, 520 cc. Electrolyteloading tests indicated that electrolyte alterations were not responsible for this action. After several months of treatment, a reduced dosage continued to be effective. Calesnick B, Brenner SA. An Observation of Hydrochlorothiazide in Diabetes Insipidus. JAMA. 1961; 176: 1088–1091.

REAFFIRMING THE PLACE OF DIURETICS IN HYPERTENSION AND COMORBIDITIES

A first-line treatment in guidelines

Guidelines throughout the world list diuretics as one of the first-line treatments for patients with essential hypertension. This choice is based on the observation that a wide range of patients can benefit from diuretics, which counter the extracellular volume expansion and the salt retention associated with hypertension and reduce morbidity and mortality. For most patients, the risk of a clinically meaningful change in laboratory parameters is rather low, whereas the clinical benefits of diuretics are high.

The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) hypertension guidelines, for instance, name the reduction of clinical events as the main criterion for endorsing any antihypertensive medication and cite results of meta-analyses that show that diuretics perform as well as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, calcium channel blockers (CCB), and angiotensin receptor blockers (Fig. 1). These meta-analyses include key randomized controlled trials, such as the Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT; N = 33 357), which is of particular interest because it compared the long-term effects of treatment with chlorthalidone, amlodipine, and lisinopril. In this cohort of hypertensive patients who had at least one other coronary heart disease risk factor, no significant between-group differences were found for the primary outcome (combined fatal coronary heart disease or nonfatal myocardial infarction) or for all-cause mortality. Higher fasting glucose levels were observed with chlorthalidone, but there was no conclusive evidence that the modestly increased risk of developing diabetes mellitus resulted in an increased risk of other clinical events.

### The metabolic cost of lowering blood pressure with hydrochlorothiazide [^116GKidv]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2013). Low credibility.

The incidence of obesity and obesity-related complications such as hypertension and type 2 diabetes are rising steadily despite the increased public and scientific awareness of this multifactorial problem. Although specific efforts to turn the obesity tide concentrate on the development of new treatment strategies, it is important to revisit old therapies and review their side effect profiles as some treatments may silently augment the metabolic syndrome.

The landmark Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering treatment to prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT) placed a new spotlight on thiazide diuretics as the first-line therapy for hypertension. This is concerning as thiazide-diuretics may contribute to comorbidities associated with the current epidemic of obesity. Previous randomized clinical trials have linked treatment with thiazide diuretic to insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome, and increased incidence of type 2 diabetes.

On the contrary, evidence accumulates that therapies which interfere with the adverse metabolic effects of angiotensin II, such as angiotensin II receptor blocking (ARB) or/and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE I) therapies, cause no metabolic harm as confirmed by the DREAM and NAVIGATOR studies. The favorable metabolic action of ARB and ACE-I agents could originate from improvement of insulin sensitivity or could be facilitated through the recruitment and differentiation of adipocytes. Both mechanisms could lead to reduction in ectopic deposition of triglyceride in organs such as liver, heart, pancreas and skeletal muscle, a hypothesis that has not yet been tested.

We present the results of a randomized study comparing the metabolic effects of treatment with hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) and Valsartan in individuals at high risk for development of type 2 diabetes. We specifically evaluated the effect of these treatments on intra-hepatic triglyceride content as well as insulin sensitivity, beta-cell function, and ectopic triglyceride deposition in the heart, pancreas, and skeletal muscle.

### New-onset diabetes and antihypertensive drugs [^117PMHtj]. Journal of Hypertension (2006). Low credibility.

Observational studies have provided evidence that a consistent fraction (approximately 15–20%) of hypertensive patients displays a glucose intolerance state that may be aggravated by antihypertensive drug regimens based on thiazide diuretics or beta-blockers. This review examines the relative and absolute diabetogenic effects of antihypertensive drugs, by comparing the impact of 'new' (calcium antagonists, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor antagonists) versus 'old' (diuretics and beta-blockers) drugs on new-onset diabetes in recent clinical trials. Evidence is provided that compared with diuretics and beta-blockers, new-onset diabetes is less common with 'new' drugs, and that conventional antihypertensive compounds, particularly when combined together, may amplify the natural time-dependent tendency towards the development of this metabolic disease. This paper provides new insights into the potential mechanisms responsible for the phenomenon and the clinical significance of antihypertensive drug-induced diabetes.

### 2018 ESC / ESH guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension [^115DXsN4]. European Heart Journal (2018). Medium credibility.

ESC/ESH 2018 hypertension — treatment strategies in people with diabetes — Antihypertensive drug treatment is recommended for people with diabetes when office BP is ≥ 140/90 mmHg. For those receiving BP-lowering drugs, it is recommended to target SBP to 130 mmHg and < 130 mmHg if tolerated, but not < 120 mmHg; in older people (aged ≥ 65 years), to target to an SBP range of 130–139 mmHg; and to target the DBP to < 80 mmHg, but not < 70 mmHg. It is recommended to initiate treatment with a combination of a renin–angiotensin system (RAS) blocker with a calcium channel blocker (CCB) or a thiazide/thiazide-like diuretic; when eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m^2, avoid thiazide/thiazide-like diuretics and consider using a loop diuretic when a diuretic is required. Simultaneous administration of two RAS blockers, e.g. an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), is not indicated.

### The metabolic cost of lowering blood pressure with hydrochlorothiazide [^113ifMgr]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2013). Low credibility.

Discussion

We have demonstrated a differential metabolic effect of two frequently prescribed antihypertensive agents in individuals at risk for type 2 diabetes. The findings of our study relate to hepatic steatosis and insulin sensitivity. HCTZ treatment worsened hepatic steatosis measured as hepatic TG content and reduced insulin sensitivity. Valsartan treatment did not affect hepatic TG levels and improved insulin sensitivity. The results of this study reinforce the message that in patients at risk for type 2 diabetes it is particularly important to choose an antihypertensive regimen that lowers blood pressure without exacerbating patient's metabolic profile.

Our results pllel the earlier reported findings from the MEDICA study. MEDICA investigators reported similar worsening in hepatic triglyceride content and insulin sensitivity following 3 months of treatment with 50 mg of HCTZ and observed no change of hepatic triglyceride levels following treatment with another ARB class medication Candesartan. In light of such tight agreement of two independent studies, therapy with HCTZ - widely accepted as first-line agent for treating hypertension - should be re-evaluated. HCTZ offer affordable and efficient blood pressure lowering but come with the added cost of worsening metabolic profiles for diabetes. This can occur even at doses of 25 mg and is sustained over a longer treatment period (8 months). By the same means, the ARB agents improve insulin sensitivity and did not cause fatty liver.

### Primary prevention of ASCVD and T2DM in patients at metabolic risk: an endocrine society* clinical practice guideline [^116244a9]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). High credibility.

Endocrine Society guideline — antihypertensive therapy and metabolic effects in prediabetes/metabolic syndrome: An additional 10 mm Hg reduction in systolic blood pressure (BP) reduced atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk in a meta-analysis, but there was no reduced cardiovascular (CV) risk among those < 140/90 mm Hg; in DREAM, with mean baseline systolic BP 136.1 mm Hg, the primary endpoints showed no difference. In ALLHAT, 31,512 adults ≥ 55 years with hypertension and another coronary heart disease (CHD) risk factor stratified into impaired fasting glucose (IFG) (n = 1399) and normoglycemic (n = 17,012) had no significant difference in risk ratio for the composite primary outcome across randomized treatments with chlorthalidone, amlodipine besylate, or lisinopril. Thiazide diuretics and/or traditional beta-blockers can increase insulin resistance and worsen glucose tolerance, and long-term diuretic use increased fasting glucose in IFG but the increase into the diabetes range was not associated with increased ASCVD risk after a 12-year follow-up when diabetes was treated. Traditional beta-blockers were associated with a 15% to 29% increased risk of developing diabetes, whereas newer vasodilating beta-blockers (carvedilol, nebivolol) have neutral or favorable metabolic effects and might be a practical option; nebivolol has a very good metabolic profile but lacks cardiovascular outcomes data except in older people. A diuretic or beta-blocker used alone in overweight or obese individuals with IFG will increase the risk for diabetes development.

General

All patients receiving diuretic therapy should be observed for evidence of fluid or electrolyte imbalance: namely, hyponatremia, hypochloremic alkalosis, and hypokalemia. Serum and urine electrolyte determinations are particularly important when the patient is vomiting excessively or receiving parenteral fluids. Warning signs or symptoms of fluid and electrolyte imbalance, irrespective of cause, include dryness of mouth, thirst, weakness, lethargy, drowsiness, restlessness, confusion, seizures, muscle pains or cramps, muscular fatigue, hypotension, oliguria, tachycardia, and gastrointestinal disturbances such as nausea and vomiting.

Hypokalemia may develop, especially with brisk diuresis, when severe cirrhosis is present or after prolonged therapy.

Interference with adequate oral electrolyte intake will also contribute to hypokalemia. Hypokalemia may cause cardiac arrhythmia and may also sensitize or exaggerate the response of the heart to the toxic effects of digitalis (e.g., increased ventricular irritability). Hypokalemia may be avoided or treated by use of potassium sparing diuretics or potassium supplements such as foods with a high potassium content.

Although any chloride deficit is generally mild and usually does not require specific treatment except under extraordinary circumstances (as in liver disease or renal disease), chloride replacement may be required in the treatment of metabolic alkalosis.

Dilutional hyponatremia may occur in edematous patients in hot weather; appropriate therapy is water restriction, rather than administration of salt, except in rare instances when the hyponatremia is life threatening. In actual salt depletion, appropriate replacement is the therapy of choice.

Hyperuricemia may occur or acute gout may be precipitated in certain patients receiving thiazides.

In diabetic patients dosage adjustments of insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents may be required. Hyperglycemia may occur with thiazide diuretics. Thus latent diabetes mellitus may become manifest during thiazide therapy.

The antihypertensive effects of the drug may be enhanced in the post-sympathectomy patient.

If progressive renal impairment becomes evident, consider withholding or discontinuing diuretic therapy.

Thiazides have been shown to increase the urinary excretion of magnesium; this may result in hypomagnesemia.

Thiazides may decrease urinary calcium excretion. Thiazides may cause intermittent and slight elevation of serum calcium in the absence of known disorders of calcium metabolism. Marked hypercalcemia may be evidence of hidden hyperparathyroidism. Thiazides should be discontinued before carrying out tests for parathyroid function.

Increases in cholesterol and triglyceride levels may be associated with thiazide diuretic therapy.

### Hypertension in people with type 2 diabetes: knowledge-based diabetes-specific guidelines [^116SZ5a5]. Diabetic Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

The International Diabetes Federation (Europe) has updated these guidelines on hypertension management specifically in Type 2 diabetes in the light of recent results of the first prospective, randomized controlled studies to investigate clinical outcomes in people with diabetes and hypertension. The guidelines are knowledge based, i.e. based not only on evidence originating from clinical trials, but also from epidemiological and pathophysiological studies. A successful management strategy requires the following components: 1. Regular surveillance to detect developing hypertension and other cardiovascular (CV) risk factors. 2. Considering more frequent monitoring and review of CV risk factors if any single blood pressure (BP) measurement > 140/85 mmHg (or 130/75 if microalbuminuria); when appropriate, using ambulatory or home monitoring to establish the baseline BP. 3. Considering other CV risk factors, such as a raised albumin excretion rate, in setting the intervention threshold. 4. Individualizing the target BP in accordance with other CV risk factors. 5. Agreeing lifestyle and therapeutic interventions with the patient, with education and empowerment as required. 6. Implementing lifestyle modifications, including controlling calorie, salt and alcohol intake, increased physical activity, weight control and smoking cessation. 7. Therapeutic strategy: the primary goal of therapy is to reduce BP markedly. Combination therapy is often necessary, e.g. an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and a diuretic. Some classes are particularly useful for certain patients, notably longer-acting ACE inhibitors, angiotensin 2 receptor antagonists (A2RAs) and calcium antagonists in those at risk of diabetic nephropathy, loop diuretics and thiazides in those at risk of hyperkalaemia, beta-blockers and calcium antagonists (except short-acting dihydropyridines) in patients with angina, beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors after a myocardial infarction or in those with left ventricular dysfunction, and thiazide diuretics and long-acting dihydropyridine calcium antagonists for isolated systolic hypertension. A2RAs should be particularly considered when ACE inhibitors are not tolerated. alpha 1-Blockers should not be considered first line in the absence of outcome data. Cost of drugs will modify these strategies in developing countries. 8. Monitoring response to therapies and, if target levels are not achieved, either intensifying drug therapy if the CV risk justifies it, or reassessing the target. 9. Maintaining a quality assurance strategy. This strategy is summarized in a simple, practical management algorithm.

Thiazide Diuretics

Current Evidence

The ALLHAT trial found that the incidence of diabetes was significantly increased (48%) in the chlorthalidone group compared to lisinopril use. A meta-analysis reported that thiazide diuretics increased fasting plasma glucose compared to non-thiazide agents or placebo, although the mean difference was relatively small at 4.8 mg/dL or 0.27 mmol/L. Shafi et al. reports that the risk of chlorthalidone was twice as high compared to placebo, with a number needed to harm of 29 (95% CI 17–60) over 1 year, but there was no further risk afterwards.

Mechanism of Action

Diuretic use commonly causes hypokalemia, which then results in a reduction of insulin secretion. Other mechanisms that have been suggested are related to increases in free fatty acid levels which decrease insulin secretion in response to glucose, significant reduction in insulin sensitivity, and enhanced hepatic gluconeogenesis in addition to catecholamine secretion.

Management

A study by Cooper-DeHoff has demonstrated that new-onset diabetes caused by hydrochlorothiazide may occur at 9–18 weeks of initiation. On the basis of this finding, we suggest screening for diabetes between 3 and 6 months after initiation of diuretics, depending on clinical suspicion. Since hypokalemia is postulated to be the main trigger for decreased insulin secretion, maintaining normal potassium levels (including potential use of potassium supplementation, if needed) is recommended. Diuretic-induced hyperglycemia is also dose dependent, so using the lowest effective dose or combining with other first-line antihypertensives such as calcium channel blockers, ACE inhibitors, or ARBs should also be considered. As always, lifestyle measures should also be implemented.

### Effect of amiloride, or amiloride plus hydrochlorothiazide, versus hydrochlorothiazide on glucose tolerance and blood pressure (PATHWAY-3): a parallel-group, double-blind randomised phase 4 trial [^111EAhZk]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2016). Medium credibility.

Statistical analysis

Based on at least 80% power to detect a mean difference in 2 h glucose between two treatment groups of 1 mmol/L (SD 2·2) with two-sample t tests with a 1% significance level, 414 patients were needed. 1 mmol/L was the observed difference in 2 h glucose concentrations in the largest previous trial of glucose intolerance caused by hydrochlorothiazide.

To test both the mechanistic hypothesis — ie, that a potassium-sparing diuretic (amiloride) is better than a potassium-losing diuretic (hydrochlorothiazide) in terms of effect on glucose tolerance — and that their combination is a practical alternative to hydrochlorothiazide monotherapy, the study had two hierarchical primary endpoints: we first compared 2 h glucose in the hydrochlorothiazide group with that of the amiloride group. If the difference between the groups was significant, we then compared 2 h glucose in the hydrochlorothiazide group with the combination amiloride–hydrochlorothiazide group. Hierarchical analysis prevents loss of power, because the prespecified first test needs to be positive before the next can be examined.

We tested for differences between groups for primary and secondary endpoints by using mixed-effect models to analyse continuous variables, with unstructured covariances for repeated measures within a patient, and adjustments for prespecified baseline covariates (sex, age, height, weight, smoking history, and the baseline value of the outcome being analysed). We estimated least-squares means for each treatment from these models, which are averaged from measurements at 12 and 24 weeks unless stated otherwise. We used similar models to assess baseline measurements that predicted response in 2 h glucose and home systolic blood pressure. We used logistic models to compare the proportion of patients who achieved target systolic blood pressure (defined as ≤ 140 mm Hg) at 24 weeks between the treatment groups and to compare the proportion of patients who developed diabetes by the end of the study between the three treatment groups. We used Fisher's exact test for comparisons of adverse events between groups.

### Losartan potassium and hydrochlorothiazide (losartan potassium and hydrochlorothiazide) [^116Qf4dw]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

1.1 Hypertension

Losartan potassium and hydrochlorothiazide is indicated for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure lowers the risk of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular (CV) events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarction. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes including losartan and hydrochlorothiazide.

Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than 1 drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program's Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC).

Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly.

Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal.

Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in Black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy.

This fixed dose combination is not indicated for initial therapy of hypertension, except when the hypertension is severe enough that the value of achieving prompt blood pressure control exceeds the risk of initiating combination therapy in these patients [see Clinical Studies (14) and Dosage and Administration (2.1)].

Losartan potassium and hydrochlorothiazide may be administered with other antihypertensive agents.

### Thiazide diuretics, potassium, and the development of diabetes: a quantitative review [^11355Z1u]. Hypertension (2006). Low credibility.

National guidelines and a recent clinical trial have supported the use of thiazide diuretics as the preferred initial pharmacological treatment for hypertension. However, evidence from this and other clinical trials have also found an increased incidence of new onset diabetes among those patients receiving thiazide diuretics. The mechanisms responsible for the increased incidence of diabetes with thiazide diuretics have not been fully elucidated. This article provides a review of intervention studies that included data on the relation between thiazide-induced hypokalemia and glucose intolerance. We conducted a literature search from 1966 to June 2004 to identify clinical trials using thiazide diuretics where the metabolic effects on potassium and glucose are reported. A total of 59 clinical trials constituting 83 thiazide diuretic study arms were identified. Trial size, length, type of thiazide diuretic, and dose varied substantially among the studies. The association between average changes in potassium and glucose in the study arms is considered jointly in a weighted statistical model. The Pearson's correlation coefficient, weighted by study sample size, for the relationship between glucose and potassium was -0.54 (95% CI, -0.67 to -0.36; P < 0.01). A sensitivity analysis, which considered subset analyses and effect of covariates, as well as inverse-variance weighting, supported this finding. These data suggest that thiazide-induced hypokalemia is associated with increased blood glucose. Treatment of thiazide-induced hypokalemia may reverse glucose intolerance and possibly prevent the future development of diabetes.

Summary

Background

Potassium depletion by thiazide diuretics is associated with a rise in blood glucose. We assessed whether addition or substitution of a potassium-sparing diuretic, amiloride, to treatment with a thiazide can prevent glucose intolerance and improve blood pressure control.

Methods

We did a parallel-group, randomised, double-blind trial in 11 secondary and two primary care sites in the UK. Eligible patients were aged 18–80 years; had clinic systolic blood pressure of 140 mm Hg or higher and home systolic blood pressure of 130 mmHg or higher on permitted background drugs of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin-receptor blockers, β blockers, calcium-channel blockers, or direct renin inhibitors (previously untreated patients were also eligible in specific circumstances); and had at least one component of the metabolic syndrome in addition to hypertension. Patients with known diabetes were excluded. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to 24 weeks of daily oral treatment with starting doses of 10 mg amiloride, 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide, or 5 mg amiloride plus 12·5 mg hydrochlorothiazide; all doses were doubled after 12 weeks. Random assignment was done via a central computer system. Both participants and investigators were masked to assignment. Our hierarchical primary endpoints, assessed on a modified intention-to-treat basis at 12 and 24 weeks, were the differences from baseline in blood glucose measured 2 h after a 75 g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), compared first between the hydrochlorothiazide and amiloride groups, and then between the hydrochlorothiazide and combination groups. A key secondary endpoint was change in home systolic blood pressure at 12 and 24 weeks. This trial is registered with, number, and the MHRA, Eudract number 2009–010068–41, and is now complete.

Findings

Between Nov 18, 2009, and Dec 15, 2014, 145 patients were randomly assigned to amiloride, 146 to hydrochlorothiazide, and 150 to the combination group. 132 participants in the amiloride group, 134 in the hydrochlorothiazide group, and 133 in the combination group were included in the modified intention-to-treat analysis. 2 h glucose concentrations after OGTT, averaged at 12 and 24 weeks, were significantly lower in the amiloride group than in the hydrochlorothiazide group (mean difference −0·55 mmol/L [95% CI −0·96 to −0·14]; p = 0·0093) and in the combination group than in the hydrochlorothiazide group (−0·42 mmol/L [–0·84 to −0·004]; p = 0·048). The mean reduction in home systolic blood pressure during 24 weeks did not differ significantly between the amiloride and hydrochlorothiazide groups, but the fall in blood pressure in the combination group was significantly greater than that in the hydrochlorothiazide group (p = 0·0068). Hyperkalaemia was reported in seven (4·8%) patients in the amiloride group and three (2·3%) patients in the combination group; the highest recorded potassium concentration was 5·8 mmol/L in a patient in the amiloride group. 13 serious adverse events occurred but the frequency did not differ significantly between groups.

Interpretation

The combination of amiloride with hydrochlorothiazide, at doses equipotent on blood pressure, prevents glucose intolerance and improves control of blood pressure compared with montherapy with either drug. These findings, together with previous data about morbidity and mortality for the combination, support first-line use of amiloride plus hydrochlorothiazide in hypertensive patients who need treatment with a diuretic.

### The metabolic cost of lowering blood pressure with hydrochlorothiazide [^116ooS7G]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The landmark Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering treatment to prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT) placed a new spotlight on thiazide diuretics as the first-line therapy for hypertension. This is concerning as thiazide-diuretics may contribute to comorbidities associated with the current epidemic of obesity. Previous randomized clinical trials have linked thiazide diuretic treatment to insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome, and increased incidence of type 2 diabetes.

Methods

This proof of concept, longitudinal, randomized, double-blind study evaluated the effects of the angiotensin II receptor blocker Valsartan and the specific thiazide diuretic Hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) on hepatic triglyceride level (primary outcome), as well as triglyceride levels within other organs including the heart, skeletal muscle, and pancreas. Additionally, we evaluated whether myocardial function, insulin sensitivity, and insulin secretion were affected by these treatments.

Results

Hepatic TG levels increased by 57% post HCTZ treatment: ∆hTG HCTZ = 4.12% and remained unchanged post Valsartan treatment: ∆hTG V = 0.06%. The elevation of hepatic TG levels after HCTZ treatment was additionally accompanied by a reduction in insulin sensitivity: ∆SI HCTZ = -1.14. Treatment with Valsartan resulted in improved insulin sensitivity: ∆SI V = 1.24. Treatment-induced changes in hepatic TG levels and insulin sensitivity were statistically significant between groups (phTG = 0.0098 and pSI = 0.0345 respectively). Disposition index, DI, remained unchanged after HCTZ treatment: ∆DI HCTZ = -141 but it was increased by a factor of 2 after treatment with Valsartan: ∆DI V = 1018). However, the change between groups was not statistically significant. Both therapies did not modify abdominal visceral and subcutaneous fat mass as well as myocardial structure and function. Additionally, myocardial, pancreatic, and skeletal muscle triglyceride deposits remained unchanged in both therapeutic arms.

Conclusions

Our findings are two-fold and relate to hepatic steatosis and insulin sensitivity. HCTZ treatment worsened hepatic steatosis measured as hepatic triglyceride content and reduced insulin sensitivity. Valsartan treatment did not affect hepatic triglyceride levels and improved insulin sensitivity. The results of this study reinforce the message that in patients at risk for type 2 diabetes it is particularly important to choose an antihypertensive regimen that lowers blood pressure without exacerbating patient's metabolic profile.

### Quinapril hydrochloride / hydrochlorothiazide [^114GjYHf]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

General

Serum Electrolyte Abnormalities

In clinical trials, hyperkalemia (serum potassium ≥ 5.8 mmol/L) occurred in approximately 2% of patients receiving quinapril. In most cases, elevated serum potassium levels were isolated values which resolved despite continued therapy. Less than 0.1% of patients discontinued therapy due to hyperkalemia. Risk factors for the development of hyperkalemia include renal insufficiency, diabetes mellitus, and the concomitant use of other drugs that raise serum potassium levels.

Hydrochlorothiazide can cause hypokalemia and hyponatremia. Hypomagnesemia can result in hypokalemia which appears difficult to treat despite potassium repletion. Drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system can cause hyperkalemia. The risk of hyperkalemia may be increased in patients with renal insufficiency, diabetes mellitus or with concomitant use of drugs that raise serum potassium (see DRUG INTERACTIONS). The risk of hypokalemia may be increased in patients with cirrhosis, brisk diuresis, or with concomitant use of drugs that lower serum potassium. Monitor serum electrolytes periodically.

Other Metabolic Disturbances

Hydrochlorothiazide may alter glucose tolerance and raise serum levels of cholesterol and triglycerides.

Hydrochlorothiazide may raise the serum uric acid level due to reduced clearance of uric acid and may cause or exacerbate hyperuricemia and precipitate gout in susceptible patients.

Hydrochlorothiazide decreases urinary calcium excretion and may cause elevations of serum calcium. Monitor calcium levels in patients with hypercalcemia receiving quinapril and hydrochlorothiazide.

Cough

Presumably due to the inhibition of the degradation of endogenous bradykinin, persistent nonproductive cough has been reported with all ACE inhibitors, resolving after discontinuation of therapy. ACE inhibitor-induced cough should be considered in the differential diagnosis of cough.

Surgery/Anesthesia

In patients undergoing surgery or during anesthesia with agents that produce hypotension, quinapril will block the angiotensin II formation that could otherwise occur secondary to compensatory renin release. Hypotension that occurs as a result of this mechanism can be corrected by volume expansion.

### The metabolic cost of lowering blood pressure with hydrochlorothiazide [^116GgBe9]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2013). Low credibility.

Primum non nocere - our treatment choices should not only improve the primary condition for which they are prescribed, but we must ensure that our patients suffer no harm. The ultimate goal of any antihypertensive therapy is to prevent cardiovascular events. The use of an antihypertensive agent that worsens hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance, both of which promote cardiovascular disease, negates the ultimate cardiovascular-preventive goal of the treatment. Hypertension clusters with metabolic syndrome, diabetes, and hepatic steatosis, and requires life-long pharmacologic treatment. When all aspects are balanced i.e. the blood pressure lowering effect and the worsening metabolic profile the use of HCTZ as a first line therapeutic choice should be questioned.

The underlying mechanism of the deleterious metabolic action of HCTZ is still debated although our results implicate concomitant worsening of fatty liver and decreased insulin sensitivity. Chronic exposure to angiotensin II may render fat cells less efficient in their capacity to adequately store excess triglyceride, resulting in tissue overflow with ectopic triglyceride and ultimately hepatic steatosis. Interestingly, blocking the renin-angiotensin system by Valsartan did not result in fatty liver. The favorable metabolic action of Valsartan is probably complex and could originate from improvement of insulin sensitivity or it could be facilitated through the recruitment and differentiation of adipocytes. In light of the above-mentioned observations it seems natural to hypothesize that pairing ARB with HCTZ could block angiotensin II and mitigate the adverse metabolic effects induced by HCTZ. Regrettably, an attempt to block these unfavorable metabolic effects of HCTZ by combining it with losartan was not successful.

We acknowledge that this study is small and these results should be replicated, yet the effect size was considerable and very compble to that found in a similar independently conducted study. We also note that small sample size did not allow us to further explore the mechanisms that contribute to our observations.

Research in context

Evidence before this study

We searched MEDLINE and Ovid with the terms "thiazide diuretic", "potassium", and "glucose tolerance" under the medical subject headings "diabetes" and "hypertension" for observational studies or clinical trials published in English of diuretic use, diabetes, and glucose tolerance in hypertension. We did our last search on July 23, 2015. A network meta-analysis by Elliott and Meyer of incident diabetes in 22 clinical trials of antihypertensive drugs involving 143 153 participants showed that placebo groups had a lower odds ratio of developing diabetes (0·77, 95% CI 0·63–0·94) when compared with thiazide-assigned groups. In a retrospective meta-analysis by Zillich and colleagues, hypokalaemia and hyperglycaemia were significantly associated in patients given thiazide diuretics. There was an average reduction in serum potassium of 0·23 mmol/L and an increase in glucose of 3·26 mg/dL in studies in which potassium supplements or potassium-sparing drugs were used. In studies in which potassium supplements or potassium-sparing drugs were not used, the average reduction in serum potassium concentrations was 0·37 mmol/L, and the increase in serum glucose was 6·01 mg/dL (p < 0·03). A quantitative review by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute in 2008 cast some doubt on the strength of the observational studies that first led to recognition of the thiazide association with diabetes, and investigators noted that the strongest evidence for an adverse effect of thiazides was in prospective outcome comparisons with placebo. The conclusion was that prospective studies should be done to investigate the hypothesis that hypokalaemia is the mediator of thiazide-induced dysglycaemia. Since 2008, diuretic doses and use have fallen because of concerns about metabolic consequences.

### Thiazides for kidney stone recurrence prevention [^115o6Vka]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

(ii) There was a trend for lower urine citrate among patients receiving hydrochlorothiazide compared to patients receiving placebo during follow-up. Reduction of urine citrate is a well known adverse effect of thiazides. The mechanism is thought to be thiazide-induced hypokalemia resulting in intracellular acidosis, stimulating avid citrate reabsorption in the proximal tubule. Indeed, patients receiving hydrochlorothiazide displayed a dose-dependent decrease in plasma potassium.

Nonadherence in NOSTONE was defined as missing > 20% of the daily doses of hydrochlorothiazide or placebo on the basis of patient report, and further separated into medical reasons (e.g. adverse effects necessitating a treatment discontinuation) and nonmedical reasons. Nonadherence was not different in patients receiving hydrochlorothiazide compared to patients receiving placebo. However, significant nonadherence was observed, ranging from 15% in the 12.5-mg hydrochlorothiazide group, to 24% in the 25-mg hydrochlorothiazide group, and to 26% in the 50-mg hydrochlorothiazide and placebo groups, respectively. To assess if nonadherence could explain the lack of a treatment benefit with hydrochlorothiazide, a per-protocol analysis was conducted. This analysis yielded very similar results as the intention-to-treat analysis, indicating that poor adherence cannot explain the trial results. Nevertheless, it cannot be excluded that the high incidence of nonadherence may have biased the treatment effects in favor of the null hypothesis.

No significant variation was observed among the groups in terms of serious adverse events. But patients assigned to hydrochlorothiazide had a higher incidence of adverse events of particular concern, including newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus, hypokalemia, gout, and deteriorated kidney function, than those assigned to the placebo. Clearly, these adverse events observed in a trial with a median duration of 3 years need to be reconciled with the fact that thiazides are typically prescribed on a long-term basis, and in the case of kidney stone prevention, treatment is frequently initiated in young adults.

Introduction

The optimum diuretic for hypertension remains uncertain. Disparity has been growing between the drugs and doses proven to reduce risk of stroke, myocardial infarction, and heart failure, and those recommended by guidelines. This move away from recommendation of diuretics in guidelines was driven by an awareness that thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics can increase risk of developing type 2 diabetes. The risk seems linked to potassium depletion, and might be avoided by use of potassium-sparing diuretics, which are conventionally thought to be the weakest class of diuretic because most filtered sodium is reabsorbed upstream of their site of action in the nephron. But potassium-sparing diuretics target a common site of sodium retention in hypertension, and might be essential in the prevention of compensatory responses to the more proximally acting thiazide and loop diuretics. Thus, the hypothesis arose for the present study that an adequate dose of potassium-sparing diuretic would have opposite effects on potassium and glucose to those of a thiazide diuretic, but would have similar or additional effects on blood pressure when the two were compared or combined.

### Amiloride hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide [^111vAmnU]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

Metabolic and Endocrine Effects

In diabetic patients, insulin requirements may be increased, decreased, or unchanged due to the hydrochlorothiazide component. Diabetes mellitus that has been latent may become manifest during administration of thiazide diuretics.

Because calcium excretion is decreased by thiazides, amiloride and hydrochlorothiazide should be discontinued before carrying out tests for parathyroid function. Pathologic changes in the parathyroid glands, with hypercalcemia and hypophosphatemia have been observed in a few patients on prolonged thiazide therapy; however, the common complications of hyperparathyroidism such as renal lithiasis, bone resorption, and peptic ulceration have not been seen.

Hyperuricemia may occur or acute gout may be precipitated in certain patients receiving thiazide therapy.

Other Precautions

In patients receiving thiazides, sensitivity reactions may occur with or without a history of allergy or bronchial asthma. The possibility of exacerbation or activation of systemic lupus erythematosus has been reported with the use of thiazides.

Increases in cholesterol and triglyceride levels may be associated with thiazide diuretic therapy.

### Diabetes: treating hypertension [^1167YcHe]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2007). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Among people with diabetes, around 40% of those aged 45 years, and more than 60% of those aged 75 years and over, will have a blood pressure greater than 140/90 mm Hg. Major cardiac events occur in approximately 5% of people with diabetes and untreated hypertension each year, and the risk is higher in those with other risk factors such as diabetic nephropathy.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of antihypertensives, and of different blood pressure targets, in people with diabetes? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library and other important databases up to February 2007 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 22 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: alpha-blockers, angiotensin II receptor antagonists, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, beta-blockers, blood pressure targets (lower or higher), calcium channel blockers, and diuretics.

Hypertension management in persons with type 2 diabetes (T2D) emphasizes appropriate assessment and individualized pharmacotherapy: The use of 24‑hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) is not part of diagnostic criteria but "is an important tool for guiding management", and "Routine use of ABPM may be considered for the evaluation of white‑coat hypertension, masked hypertension, and nighttime nondipping status". For treatment inertia, "pharmacotherapy should be intensified when needed to achieve BP goals". As initial agents, "ACE inhibitors or ARBs are indicated as pharmacotherapy for BP control and to delay the progression of CKD", while "ACE inhibitors and ARBs should not be used together and should be used with caution with spironolactone to avoid hyperkalemia or AKI". Thiazide diuretics can be effective "in persons aged 65 years and older", though low‑dose hydrochlorothiazide may adversely affect glycemia and lipids. "BP control reduces the risk of stroke and major CVD events in persons with T2D". For resistant hypertension, "The addition of a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist should be considered…; however, monitoring for hyperkalemia and kidney function is necessary in those taking an ACE inhibitor or ARB".

### Blood pressure lowering and risk of new-onset type 2 diabetes: an individual participant data meta-analysis [^112bxNNg]. Lancet (2021). Excellent credibility.

Research in context

Evidence before this study

PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus were searched for published data related to "hypertension", "blood pressure", and "diabetes", with no language restrictions between Jan 1, 1966, and Sept 1, 2021. We found no meta-analysis of randomised trials that reported the effect of blood pressure reduction itself on incident diabetes. Several observational cohort studies were identified but with conflicting findings. For the question of drug-class specific effects, we found several individual trial reports, including a network meta-analysis. However, it remains uncertain whether the protective or adverse effects on diabetes risk are due to blood pressure reduction per se or off-target effects of each of the drug classes.

Added value of this study

We used large-scale individual participant data from randomised controlled trials to investigate the effect of blood pressure lowering and the differential effects of five major classes of antihypertensives on risk of new-onset type 2 diabetes. A fixed level of 5 mm Hg reduction in systolic blood pressure reduced the risk of diabetes by 11%. This treatment effect constituted quantitatively and qualitatively diverging effects of major antihypertensive drug classes. In analysis of specific drug classes versus placebo, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers had the strongest protective effect on the risk of diabetes. For calcium channel blockers no material effect was found, while β blockers and thiazide diuretics increased the risk.

Implications of all the available evidence

This study suggests that blood pressure lowering can help prevent diabetes in addition to its well established beneficial effects in reducing cardiovascular events. The relative magnitude of reduction per 5 mm Hg systolic blood pressure lowering was similar to those reported for prevention of major cardiovascular events, which will strengthen the case for blood pressure reduction through lifestyle interventions known to reduce blood pressure, and blood pressure lowering treatments with drugs, and possibly device therapies. The differing effects of some drug classes also support decision making for drug choice according to an individual's risk profile. In particular, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers should become the drugs of choice when clinical risk of diabetes is of concern, whereas β blockers and thiazide diuretics should be avoided where possible. This study also encourages further research into identification and clinical testing of alternative mechanisms for diabetes prevention that are not necessarily targeting hyperglycaemia. Thus, this research could provide additional avenues for curbing the growing burden of diabetes.

### DCRM multispecialty practice recommendations for the management of diabetes, cardiorenal, and metabolic diseases [^117732q3]. Journal of Diabetes and Its Complications (2022). Medium credibility.

2.2.2. Management of Hypertension in Diabetes, Cardiorenal, and Metabolic Diseases

Current guidelines recommend a BP < 130/80 mmHg to slow CKD progression. Systolic BP (SBP) levels ≥ 140 mmHg have been associated with faster declines in kidney function. In addition, those with more than 1 g/day of albuminuria regardless of CKD etiology and/or a history of stroke benefit from SBP levels < 120 mmHg. On average, ~3 BP medications are needed to achieve a SBP < 130 mmHg. For any patient with albuminuria and hypertension, the BP-lowering regimen should include a renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitor at maximal dose, a calcium channel blocker (CCB), and a thiazide-type diuretic such as chlorthalidone or indapamide. Chlorthalidone or indapamide are preferred over hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) because they have a longer half-life and reduce mortality compared to HCTZ.

When treating people with SBP well above 150–160 mmHg, rapidly controlling BP will lead to an increase of up to 30% in serum creatinine, regardless of RAS inhibition. This effect is expected and temporary; it is not a sign of acute kidney injury. If therapy is continued, the creatinine elevation will resolve over the span of a week or so. Moreover, increases in creatinine in response to BP treatment should not be concerning unless hyperkalemia develops or creatinine continues to rise above 30%. The most common cause of this problem is pre-existing volume depletion, and the patient should be hydrated.

Out-of-office assessment of BP is very important because white coat and especially masked hypertension (i.e. higher BP elevations outside than inside the clinic) are commonly missed and will affect BP treatment. These conditions must be diagnosed with home BP monitoring and the measurements compared with office readings. The cardiovascular mortality risk may be increased in patients with white coat or masked hypertension. For many of these patients, pharmacologic and/or behavioral therapies for anxiety and other stress-related disorders may be needed in addition to antihypertensive medication.

### Thiazide exposure and cardiovascular risk in type 2 diabetes mellitus: a point of clarification [^117T7mrj]. Hypertension (2020). Medium credibility.

A recently published analysis in Hypertension suggests that thiazide use, versus nonuse, is associated with excess risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes in patients with diabetes mellitus enrolled in the ACCORD trial (Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes). Here, we replicate these findings using the same publicly available datasets and following their reported methods. We further show that possible misclassification of thiazide exposure exists in the original analysis. We perform alternative analyses that correct for this misclassification to highlight the impact that misclassification can have on observed associations between an exposure (eg, thiazides) and outcomes (eg, stroke and major adverse cardiovascular events).

### Blood pressure lowering and risk of new-onset type 2 diabetes: an individual participant data meta-analysis [^112HBeQu]. Lancet (2021). Excellent credibility.

Although the exact biological pathways through which elevated blood pressure causes new-onset type 2 diabetes are unknown, several potential mechanisms have been reported. Among others, insulin resistance, vascular inflammation, and endothelial dysfunction, which tend to precede the clinical manifestation of diabetes, are all pathophysiological consequences of hypertension. For instance, insulin resistance might play a central role in the cross-talk between metabolism and cardiovascular pathways. Other pathways, such as increased activation of the sympathetic nervous system and chronic inflammation leading to endothelial dysfunction, have also been suggested as links between hypertension and the risk of diabetes. Notably, the effect of antihypertensive drug classes on these mediating factors is variable and might explain their differential off-target effects. As an example, renin angiotensin inhibition has been shown to reduce the concentration of inflammatory markers, independently of the blood pressure lowering effect, which might enhance their protective effect on diabetes. Other plausible biological mechanisms for their protective effect is the improvement of insulin resistance through the suppression of reactive oxygen species. For β blockers and thiazide diuretics, although there is no certainty about the biological pathway for diabetes risk, studies have suggested that modification of insulin secretion and carbohydrate metabolism in β blockers, and potassium depletion in thiazide diureticscould play a role. Likewise, CCBs have either no known material effects on these mediating mechanisms or might have additional pathophysiological sequelae that negate their blood pressure lowering effect. Further experimental studies are required to explore these and other possible mechanisms. In addition, by showing that the risk of diabetes can be modified with drugs that are not targeting hyperglycaemia, this study encourages future research to identify additional molecular targets for the prevention of diabetes.

### Cardiovascular therapies and associated glucose homeostasis: implications across the dysglycemia continuum [^116xczTL]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2009). Low credibility.

Certain cardiovascular drugs have adverse effects on glucose homeostasis, which may lead to important long-term implications for increased risks of adverse outcomes. Thiazide diuretics, niacin, and beta-adrenergic blockers impair glucose homeostasis. However, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers have demonstrated beneficial metabolic effects. The newer vasodilating beta-blocking agents and calcium antagonists appear to be metabolically neutral. These considerations, in addition to meticulous attention to blood pressure control and lifestyle changes, have the potential to beneficially modify glycemia and long-term risks. These considerations have particular importance in younger patients who may also have pre-diabetes or the metabolic syndrome and who are likely to require therapy over the course of decades.

### Hydrochlorothiazide is America's most popular thiazide, but should It Be? [^114T3Cvz]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

These key pharmacologic differences have contributed to the long‐standing debate among clinicians and hypertension experts about whether chlorthalidone or hydrochlorothiazide is superior. Multiple systematic reviews and meta‐analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have previously demonstrated that the thiazide‐like diuretics better prevent cardiovascular events and all‐cause mortality compared with the thiazide‐type diuretics. These systematic reviews and meta‐analyses, however, included many RCTs conducted before 1990 and few RCTs of indapamide. Consequently, the generalizability of the findings to the current era may be limited as the prevalence and nature of cardiovascular disease risk factors have evolved and as we have refined our knowledge about which classes should be used first line for hypertension treatment. Observational studies have provided contrasting conclusions on this debate, with one finding no difference between chlorthalidone and hydrochlorothiazidewhereas another one showed better outcomes with hydrochlorothiazide, not chlorthalidone. However, the follow‐up period in these observational studies was probably too brief to detect differences in clinical end points and the conflicting findings are likely due to residual confounding. For these reasons, the available meta‐analyses and observational studies offer little practical guidance in thiazide selection. Instead, what may be more helpful for current clinicians is to recall the findings from more recent, large RCTs that have critically appraised these agents. The Table, lists several pivotal RCTs of the thiazides published since 2000 relevant to common and everyday clinical scenarios. Chlorthalidone and indapamide treat hypertension effectively and safely in several clinical settings, including in patients with multiple coronary artery disease risk factors, prior stroke, elderly age, and advanced chronic kidney disease. Additionally, small RCTs have demonstrated that combination therapy containing chlorthalidone provides superior hypertension treatment compared with combination therapy containing hydrochlorothiazide and to combination therapy without any thiazide diuretic, including among patients with stage 2 hypertension. Finally, the thiazide‐like diuretics offer pleiotropic protection against cardiovascular diseases independently of blood pressure reduction. In contrast, no cardiovascular benefit with hydrochlorothiazide treatment has been consistently found. Despite these randomized data, the hydrochlorothiazide‐versus‐chlorthalidone debate has continued in part because until recently no trial had directly compared the 2.

### Amiloride hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide [^113z9L2M]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

Diabetes Mellitus

In diabetic patients, hyperkalemia has been reported with the use of all potassium-conserving diuretics, including amiloride HCl, even in patients without evidence of diabetic nephropathy. Therefore, amiloride and hydrochlorothiazide should be avoided, if possible, in diabetic patients and, if it is used, serum electrolytes and renal function must be monitored frequently.

Amiloride and hydrochlorothiazide should be discontinued at least three days before glucose tolerance testing.

Metabolic or Respiratory Acidosis

Antikaliuretic therapy should be instituted only with caution in severely ill patients in whom respiratory or metabolic acidosis may occur, such as patients with cardiopulmonary disease or poorly controlled diabetes. If amiloride and hydrochlorothiazide is given to these patients, frequent monitoring of acid-base balance is necessary. Shifts in acid-base balance alter the ratio of extracellular/intracellular potassium, and the development of acidosis may be associated with rapid increases in serum potassium levels.

### Clinical features and therapeutic perspectives on hypertension in diabetics [^115xXAKL]. Hypertension Research (2018). Low credibility.

The impact of hypertension and hypotensive drugs on insulin resistance

Diabetes develops at higher ratios in hypertensive patients than in normotensive subjects, particularly in hypertensive patients who are undergoing treatment with diuretics and β-blockers. Conversely, when captopril, an ACE inhibitor, was administered to type 2 diabetic patients who were taking oral hypotensive drugs, they developed hypoglycemia. This finding, reported in the New England Journal of Medicine in the form of a Letter, prompted a series of investigations into the influence of hypotensive drugs on insulin resistance. First, diuretics aggravate insulin resistance. Researchers note that thiazide diuretics administered in high doses cause metabolic adverse reactions such as hypokalemia and hyperuricemia and also increase the risk of sudden death. In diabetic patients, therefore, it is important to use small doses of diuretics to minimize metabolic adverse reactions. Conversely, captopril, an ACE inhibitor, was verified to improve insulin resistance. As one of the mechanisms by which captopril improves insulin resistance, we demonstrated that the drug increases blood flow in the forearm, which decreases postprandially. Later, it was revealed that ARBs, long-acting calcium antagonists, and α 1 -blockers also improve insulin resistance and lower blood glucose levels.

### Quinapril and hydrochlorothiazide [^111m9hKu]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

PRECAUTIONS

General

Serum Electrolyte Abnormalities

In clinical trials, hyperkalemia (serum potassium ≥ 5.8 mmol/L) occurred in approximately 2% of patients receiving quinapril. In most cases, elevated serum potassium levels were isolated values which resolved despite continued therapy. Less than 0.1% of patients discontinued therapy due to hyperkalemia. Risk factors for the development of hyperkalemia include renal insufficiency, diabetes mellitus, and the concomitant use of other drugs that raise serum potassium levels.

Hydrochlorothiazide can cause hypokalemia and hyponatremia. Hypomagnesemia can result in hypokalemia which appears difficult to treat despite potassium repletion. Drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system can cause hyperkalemia. The risk of hyperkalemia may be increased in patients with renal insufficiency, diabetes mellitus or with concomitant use of drugs that raise serum potassium (see Drug Interactions). The risk of hypokalemia may be increased in patients with cirrhosis, brisk diuresis, or with concomitant use of drugs that lower serum potassium. Monitor serum electrolytes periodically.

Other Metabolic Disturbances

Hydrochlorothiazide may alter glucose tolerance and raise serum levels of cholesterol and triglycerides.

Hydrochlorothiazide may raise the serum uric acid level due to reduced clearance of uric acid and may cause or exacerbate hyperuricemia and precipitate gout in susceptible patients.

### Effects of sodium restriction and hydrochlorothiazide on RAAS blockade efficacy in diabetic nephropathy: a randomised clinical trial [^113jv2mt]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2014). Medium credibility.

Background

Reduction of dietary sodium intake or diuretic treatment increases renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) blockade efficacy in non-diabetic nephropathy. We aimed to investigate the effect of sodium restriction and the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide, separately and in combination, added to RAAS blockade on residual albuminuria in patients with type 2 diabetic nephropathy.

Methods

In this multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover randomised trial, we included patients with type 2 diabetic nephropathy. Main entry criteria were microalbuminaria or macroalbuminuria, and creatinine clearance of 30 mL/min or higher with less than 6 mL/min decline in the previous year. We tested the separate and combined effects of sodium restriction (dietary counselling in the outpatient setting) and hydrochlorothiazide (50 mg daily), added to standardised maximal angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition (lisinopril 40 mg daily), on albuminuria (primary endpoint). Patients were given hydrochlorothiazide (50 mg per day) or placebo during four treatment periods of 6 weeks. Both treatments were combined with regular sodium diet or sodium restriction (target sodium intake 50 mmol Na(+) per day). The 6-week treatment periods were done consecutively in a random order. Patients were randomised in blocks of two patients. The trial was analysed by intention to treat. The trial is registered with TrialRegister.nl, number 2366.

Findings

Of 89 eligible patients, 45 were included in the study. Both sodium restriction and hydrochlorothiazide significantly reduced albuminuria, irrespective of treatment sequence. Residual geometric mean albuminuria with baseline treatment was 711 mg per day (95% CI 485–1043); it was significantly reduced by sodium restriction (393 mg per day [258–599], p = 0·0002), by hydrochlorothiazide (434 mg per day [306–618], p = 0·0003), and to the greatest extent by their combination (306 mg per day [203–461], p < 0·0001). Orthostatic complaints were present in two patients (4%) during baseline treatment, five (11%) during addition of sodium restriction, five (11%) during hydrochlorothiazide treatment, and 12 (27%) during combination treatment. No serious adverse events occurred.

Interpretation

We conclude that sodium restriction is an effective non-pharmacological intervention to increase RAAS blockade efficacy in type 2 diabetic nephropathy.

Funding

None.

### Thiazide diuretics in the treatment of hypertension: an update [^117LVoV4]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2006). Low credibility.

Thiazide diuretics were the first tolerated efficient antihypertensive drugs that significantly reduced cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in placebo-controlled clinical studies. Although these drugs today still are considered a fundamental therapeutic tool for the treatment of hypertensive patients, the following considerations should be taken into account. Although there are some indications that chlorthalidone can offer additional advantages as compared with other compounds, a recent meta-analysis of placebo-controlled trials suggested that the beneficial effects of thiazide diuretics could be a class effect. Thiazide diuretics must be used at appropriate and/or optimal doses to achieve the optimal antihypertensive effect with the smallest occurrence of side effects, including alterations in glucose and lipid profiles and hypokalemia. Moreover, because thiazide diuretics can increase the incidence of new-onset diabetes, especially when combined with beta blockers, caution is advised in using these drugs above all in patients who are at high risk for developing diabetes, in whom thiazide diuretics should be used at the lowest active dose and possibly in combination with drugs that block the renin-angiotensin system. Finally, the current debate on whether thiazide diuretics are the first-choice drug for most patients with uncomplicated hypertension, as stated in the Seventh Joint National Committee Report, or are included in the major classes of antihypertensive agents that are suitable for initiation and maintenance of therapy, as reported in the European Society of Hypertension-European Society of Cardiology Guidelines, derives from different interpretations of controlled clinical trial data on drug class comparison and of cost-benefit analyses. However, considering that the benefit of antihypertensive drugs seems to be due principally to BP lowering per se without definitive evidence of the superiority of a particular drug class and that there is no cost-benefit analysis showing the superiority of thiazide diuretics, it is believed that these drugs should not be considered as the only first-choice drug but included among first-choice drugs.

### Effect of amiloride, or amiloride plus hydrochlorothiazide, versus hydrochlorothiazide on glucose tolerance and blood pressure (PATHWAY-3): a parallel-group, double-blind randomised phase 4 trial [^116sozzT]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2016). Medium credibility.

Diuretics are the oldest among commonly used antihypertensive drugs, and their target (sodium retention) is one of the few universally agreed contributors to the pathogenesis of hypertension. Yet they have slipped in priority in some guidelines, partly because of trials in which suboptimum doses of diuretics were compared with optimum doses of other classes, and partly because of thiazide-induced diabetes. Even if thiazide-induced diabetes does not carry the same cardiovascular risks as spontaneous diabetes, diuretics cease to be cost effective when extra clinic visits and treatments for diabetes are factored into analyses. On the basis of our results from PATHWAY-3, we recommend that the combination of amiloride and hydrochlorothiazide, in doses equipotent for blood pressure reduction, becomes the first-choice diuretic in patients in whom adequate diuretic has not yet been prescribed. Our results suggest that this drug combination will confer the proven long-term benefits of hydrochlorothiazide without the possible downside of glucose intolerance. Low doses of amiloride with hydrochlorothiazide in the INSIGHT trialwere as efficacious as nifedipine in the prevention of stroke and myocardial infarction, and significantly more efficacious in the prevention of heart failure. In the Medical Research Council's Elderly trial, the combination was significantly superior to atenolol in all cardiovascular endpoints. On the basis of our findings, the combination of hydrochlorothiazide with four times as much amiloride as was used in these studies can be predicted to increase its antihypertensive efficacy and counter the risks and costs of hypokalaemia and glucose intolerance. The efficacy of potassium-sparing diuretics revealed by PATHWAY-3, and the parallel PATHWAY-2 study of spironolactone in patients with resistant hypertension, warrants investigation of their long-term benefits in hypertension.

### Redefining diuretics use in hypertension: why select a thiazide-like diuretic? [^117AiwWk]. Journal of Hypertension (2019). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

As all monogenic forms of hypertension have sodium retention as the main mechanism of the increase in blood pressure, increasing urinary sodium excretion is a logical and fundamental part of treatment of hypertension. Consistent with this understanding, thiazide diuretics are listed in hypertension guidelines as one of three equally weighted first-line antihypertensive options alongside calcium channel blockers and blockers of the renin–angiotensin system (RAS). Indeed, randomized control trials and meta-analyses have demonstrated that when compared with placebo or no treatment, blood pressure lowering by these antihypertensive drug classes is accompanied by significant reductions of stroke and major cardiovascular events. In order to differentiate between the three options, a lot of discussion has been directed at side effect profiles. Multiple meta-analyses, for instance, have documented concerns that treatment with diuretics could lead to disruptions in electrolyte levels, to unfavorable metabolic effects, and to an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus. These data, though important, have generated a perhaps disproportionate fear of the side effects that can be associated with diuretic treatment.

### Use of diuretics and outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes: findings from the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial [^1165QoQu]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2021). Medium credibility.

Side effects of LD include activation of the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone and sympathetic nervous systems, hypokalaemia, calciuria, hypovolaemia, falls and worsening renal function, which might contribute to an increase in morbidity and mortality. Our analyses demonstrate that patients with T2DM treated with a LD had higher rates of adverse events consistent with volume depletion and decreased renal function, regardless of HF status. However, LD are a pharmaco‐epidemiological signature of symptoms and signs of congestion, often due to cardiac dysfunction, and it is the congestion rather than the adverse effects of LD that is driving prognosis.

We did not find an association between use of thiazide diuretics alone and outcomes in patients with T2DM, which possibly reflects their different indication. Although thiazides might impair glucose metabolism, they are often used to treat hypertension in T2DM and have been shown to reduce CV events in this setting. For example, in the SHEP trial, chlortalidone reduced mortality in older patients with T2DM despite worsening glycaemia compared to placebo. However, patients receiving both LD, which block sodium retention in the loop of Henle, and thiazide diuretics, which act on the distal convoluted tubule (sequential nephron blockade) had similar rates of CV events to patients with HF. This is a powerful diuretic combination that is usually reserved by HF specialists for the treatment of advanced HF. It is unclear whether other physician groups are aware of how potent this combination is and its potential to treat, inadvertently, congestion and its symptoms and signs, thereby concealing a diagnosis of HF.

### ALLHAT: setting the record straight [^116rCSNj]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

The findings of the Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT) have generated worldwide reaction from clinicians and researchers, including a recent commentary in this journal. Such response was expected for a trial of ALLHAT's size and scope, especially since its results challenged some widely held beliefs. This paper reviews key aspects of the ALLHAT design, analyses, findings, and conclusions to provide a perspective on the commentary about the trial's results and implications for clinical practice. Several of the most frequent comments regarding the study's results are addressed, particularly with respect to heart failure and diabetes outcomes. Responses to these comments reinforce the investigators' original conclusion that thiazide-type diuretics should remain the preferred first-step drug class for treating hypertension and should generally be a part of any multidrug regimen.

### Hydrochlorothiazide, but not candesartan, aggravates insulin resistance and causes visceral and hepatic fat accumulation: the mechanisms for the diabetes preventing effect of candesartan (MEDICA) study [^112i81Rx]. Hypertension (2008). Low credibility.

Treatment with angiotensin II receptor blockers is associated with lower risk for the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus compared with thiazide diuretics. The Mechanisms for the Diabetes Preventing Effect of Candesartan Study addressed insulin action and secretion and body fat distribution after treatment with candesartan, hydrochlorothiazide, and placebo. Twenty-six nondiabetic, abdominally obese, hypertensive patients were included in a multicenter 3-way crossover trial, and 22 completers (by predefined criteria; 10 men and 12 women) were included in the analyses. They underwent 12-week treatment periods with candesartan (C; 16 to 32 mg), hydrochlorothiazide (H; 25 to 50 mg), and placebo (P), respectively, and the treatment order was randomly assigned and double blinded. Intravenous glucose tolerance tests and euglycemic hyperinsulinemic (56 mU/m(2) per minute) clamps were performed. Intrahepatic and intramyocellular and extramyocellular lipid content and subcutaneous and visceral abdominal adipose tissue were measured using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy and MRI. Insulin sensitivity (M-value) was reduced following H versus C and P (6.07 ± 2.05, 6.63 ± 2.04, and 6.90 ± 2.10 mg/kg of body weight per minute, mean ± SD; P ≤ 0.01). Liver fat content was higher (P < 0.05) following H than both P and C. The subcutaneous to visceral abdominal adipose tissue ratio was reduced following H versus C and P (P < 0.01). Glycosylated hemoglobin, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels were higher (P < 0.05) after H, but not C, versus P. There were no changes in body fat, intramyocellular lipid, extramyocellular lipid, or first-phase insulin secretion. Blood pressure was reduced similarly by C and H versus P. In conclusion, visceral fat redistribution, liver fat accumulation, low-grade inflammation, and aggravated insulin resistance were demonstrated after hydrochlorothiazide but not candesartan treatment. These findings can partly explain the diabetogenic potential of thiazides.

### Lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide tablets (lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide) [^112ka17T]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Although any chloride deficit is generally mild and usually does not require specific treatment, except under extraordinary circumstances (as in liver disease or renal disease), chloride replacement may be required in the treatment of metabolic alkalosis.

Dilutional hyponatremia may occur in edematous patients in hot weather; appropriate therapy is water restriction, rather than administration of salt except in rare instances when the hyponatremia is life-threatening. In actual salt depletion, appropriate replacement is the therapy of choice.

Hyperuricemia may occur or frank gout may be precipitated in certain patients receiving thiazide therapy.

In diabetic patients dosage adjustments of insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents may be required. Hyperglycemia may occur with thiazide diuretics. Thus latent diabetes mellitus may become manifest during thiazide therapy.

The antihypertensive effects of the drug may be enhanced in the postsympathectomy patient.

If progressive renal impairment becomes evident consider withholding or discontinuing diuretic therapy.

Thiazides have been shown to increase the urinary excretion of magnesium; this may result in hypomagnesemia.

Thiazides may decrease urinary calcium excretion. Thiazides may cause intermittent and slight elevation of serum calcium in the absence of known disorders of calcium metabolism. Marked hypercalcemia may be evidence of hidden hyperparathyroidism. Thiazides should be discontinued before carrying out tests for parathyroid function.

Increases in cholesterol and triglyceride levels may be associated with thiazide diuretic therapy.

### Antihypertensive medications and risk of diabetes mellitus [^116fk42K]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Over the past decade post-hoc analyses of clinical trials and observational studies have tended to show that participants treated with thiazide diuretics are at greater risk for newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus than those treated with other medication classes. We review the results of several recent studies on the impact of thiazide-related hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus on cardiovascular disease outcomes. We also examine the impact of the glucose-sparing effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers on preventing cardiovascular disease.

Recent Findings

No consistent or conclusive evidence has been found that hyperglycemia or diabetes mellitus in association with thiazide diuretic use is associated with increased cardiovascular disease outcomes. This benign outcome may be a consequence of the fact that only a segment of such diuretic-associated cases is induced by the usual etiologic mechanisms that are associated with classic 'diabetes mellitus'. Likewise, no evidence has been found that the glucose-lowering effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors is associated with decreased cardiovascular disease risk.

Summary

We conclude that thiazide diuretics are safe to use, even in hypertensive individuals at risk for incident glucose disorders. The use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors for protection against glucose disorders and subsequent cardiovascular disease remains to be determined.

### Chlorothiazide derivatives for diabetes insipidus? [^112ujA6L]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Introduction Crawford and Kennedy1 demonstrated that orally administered chlorothiazide decreased urine volume and doubled urine osmolality in rats with experimental diabetes insipidus. A similar action was also noted in both acquired and nephrogenic human diabetes insipidus. Heinemann et al. 2 reported that chlorothiazide produced decreased free water clearance by inhibiting solute reabsorption at a distal site in the nephron, thus preventing elaboration of solute-free water. However, examination of their data reveals that CH2O, corrected for decrease in glomerular filtration rate, increased slightly in all but one subject receiving a single 500 mg. intravenous dose of chlorothiazide. The largest increase occurred in a subject with diabetes insipidus, which is in contrast to the results reported following oral administration of chlorothiazide or hydrochlorothiazide to patients with diabetes insipidus.

### Losartan potassium and hydrochlorothiazide [^114jcRB5]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

1.1 Hypertension

Losartan potassium and hydrochlorothiazide tablets are indicated for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure lowers the risk of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular (CV) events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarction. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes including losartan and hydrochlorothiazide.

Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than 1 drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program's Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC).

Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly.

Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal.

Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in Black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy.

This fixed dose combination is not indicated for initial therapy of hypertension, except when the hypertension is severe enough that the value of achieving prompt blood pressure control exceeds the risk of initiating combination therapy in these patients [see Clinical Studies (14) and Dosage and Administration (2.1)].

Losartan potassium and hydrochlorothiazide tablets may be administered with other antihypertensive agents.

### Olmesartan / amlodipine / hydrochlorothiazide in participants with hypertension and diabetes, chronic kidney disease, or chronic cardiovascular disease: a subanalysis of the multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group TRINITY study [^115hQ9Dg]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Hypertension is an important risk factor for development of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and chronic kidney disease (CKD). According to previous estimates, the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2005–2008) showed that 98 million (21%) Americans have hypertension (defined as blood pressure [BP] > 140/90 mm Hg). According to new estimates, an additional 52 million (11%) of American adults (for a total of 150 million adults [32%]) have uncontrolled BP requiring treatment (as defined by the American Heart Association Task Force as BP > 140/90 mm Hg for low-risk individuals; > 130/80 mm Hg for Framingham risk score > 10%, CKD, diabetes, and CVD; and > 120/80 for congestive heart failure). Adults with diabetes (50.6 million), CKD (43.7 million), and CVD (43.3 million) have the greatest prevalence of uncontrolled BP. Hypertension is present in nearly 75% of patients with CVD, including coronary artery disease, stroke, diabetes, CKD, and peripheral artery disease; however, it is estimated that only 53% of patients receiving antihypertensive treatment achieve BP control. By 2030, it is estimated that 40.5% of the US population will have CVD.

The prevalence of hypertension is disproportionately high in patients who have diabetes, and individuals who have hypertension are nearly 2.5 times more likely to develop diabetes within 6 years than those without hypertension. Elevated BP is an important modifiable risk factor in patients with CKD, and BP reduction has the potential to both reduce cardiovascular death and attenuate progression of kidney disease. It is estimated that triple-combination therapy is needed in at least 25% of all patients with hypertension in order to control BP. Individuals who have hypertension and diabetes, CKD, or CVD are likely to need multiple antihypertensive agents to achieve the lower BP goals recommended in these high-risk populations. Furthermore, single-pill combination therapy may result in increased adherence through reduction in pill burden and simplification of the therapeutic regimen. A study including ~85,000 patients from Kaiser Permanente found that adherence decreased when the number of medications prescribed increased. In this study, antihypertensive medication adherence levels were 77.2%, 69.7%, 62.9%, and 55.5% in patients who received 1-, 2-, 3-, or 4-drug regimens, respectively.

### Redefining diuretics use in hypertension: why select a thiazide-like diuretic? [^111Me3C9]. Journal of Hypertension (2019). Medium credibility.

These blood pressure-independent effects are likely to be fundamental contributors to the differences in long-term endpoints between thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics. They are also likely to be the result of pleiotropic effects that are not governed by the targeting of the kidney.

### Effect of amiloride, or amiloride plus hydrochlorothiazide, versus hydrochlorothiazide on glucose tolerance and blood pressure (PATHWAY-3): a parallel-group, double-blind randomised phase 4 trial [^1123eQYh]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2016). Medium credibility.

Our prediction of natriuretic synergism seems to be confirmed by the significantly greater reduction in home and clinic systolic blood pressure in the combination group than in the hydrochlorothiazide group. The blood pressure reduction in the combination group was associated with a near-doubling of the reactive rise in renin concentrations compared with those in the other two groups. This rise in renin concentrations is not clinically important in patients taking RAS blockers, but is a sensitive measure of natriuresis. Results of cross-sectional studies, have suggested the importance of blood pressure control in the prevention of glucose intolerance, which might be underestimated in comparisons of different antihypertensive drug classes. In studies of single antihypertensive drugs versus placebo, the reduced incidence of diabetes might be ascribed to the specific class effect rather than reductions in blood pressure reduction. The results of our pilot crossover studies showed that drugs that impair glucose tolerance when used alone (ie, β blockers and thiazide diuretics) have a neutral effect on glucose tolerance when combined with each other, and that the more favourable effects of the combination (compared with monotherapy) on glucose tolerance is associated with superior blood pressure reduction. Therefore the more efficacious blood pressure reduction in the amiloride–hydrochlorothiazide group compared with either drug alone is probably what underpins the success of the combination in avoiding induction of glucose intolerance.

The main limitation of our study is the short duration. 24 weeks was long enough to test the hypotheses that drugs with opposite effects on potassium concentrations would have opposite effects on 2 h glucose concentrations, and that diuretics with different sites of action would have synergistic effects on sodium loss, leading to blood pressure reduction, leading to glucose tolerance. However, not all patients who had a rise in 2 h glucose concentration in our study will progress to diabetes, and our results cannot show that longer-term usage of potassium-sparing diuretics will prevent an increase in incidence of diabetes as that which occurs with thiazide diuretics. Furthermore, 24 weeks' exposure is not sufficient to provide complete assurance of long-term safety when amiloride is added to an RAS blocker — intermittent monitoring of electrolytes and estimated glomerular filtration rates will be necessary in practice.

### Valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide [^114oRtan]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (e.g., patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal.

Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy.

Add-On Therapy

Valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets may be used in patients whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled on monotherapy.

Replacement Therapy

Valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets may be substituted for the titrated components.

Initial Therapy

Valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets may be used as initial therapy in patients who are likely to need multiple drugs to achieve blood pressure goals.

The choice of valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets as initial therapy for hypertension should be based on an assessment of potential benefits and risks.
