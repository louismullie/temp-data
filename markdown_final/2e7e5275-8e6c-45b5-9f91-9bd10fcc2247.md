## Question

For a 73-year-old male with weakness, ECG shows rate 135, a regularly irregular rhythm, normal axis, P waves present, wide QRS, and large T waves in V2–V3 — what is the differential diagnosis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for the differential diagnosis for a 73-year-old man with weakness, tachycardia (rate 135), a regularly irregular rhythm, normal axis, P waves present, a wide QRS, and large T waves in V2–V3. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and symptom–ECG correlation. Then, I should verify the ECG pattern against the known progression of hyperkalemia and assess how reliable the ECG is for diagnosis. Next, I'll classify severity and decide whether treatment must proceed before labs, followed by a differential diagnosis check. After that, I should identify likely etiologies in this older patient, lay out immediate diagnostics to confirm and exclude pseudohyperkalemia, and then prioritize emergency therapies and monitoring. Finally, I will consider special populations and pitfalls, and synthesize a clear action-oriented conclusion.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and risk profile in this 73-year-old male with weakness and tachycardia, because older adults with chronic kidney disease, heart failure, diabetes, and polypharmacy are at heightened risk for hyperkalemia and its neuromuscular manifestations, including generalized weakness and paralysis, which may precede or accompany cardiotoxicity on ECG, with classic changes being peaked T waves and QRS widening as potassium rises [^113hTA5U] [^116z2yMe].

> Now, I need to check the ECG interpretation against the canonical hyperkalemia sequence; the reported peaked, "tented" T waves and widened QRS align with moderate to severe hyperkalemia on the spectrum from early T-wave peaking to PR prolongation, P-wave attenuation, and ultimately QRS widening and sine-wave morphology as levels increase, which supports the working diagnosis of hyperkalemia as the unifying explanation for weakness and rhythm disturbance in this patient [^113hTA5U] [^116rNj3M].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about the rhythm label; I initially thought "regularly irregular" with P waves present sounded compatible with a hyperkalemia-induced atrial fibrillation with variable block, but wait, that would be internally inconsistent because atrial fibrillation lacks organized P waves, so I should correct that and consider that hyperkalemia can produce a spectrum of conduction delays, blocks, and ectopy, and the tachycardia here might reflect sinus tachycardia with intermittent premature beats or evolving intraventricular conduction delay rather than atrial fibrillation, acknowledging that hyperkalemia can present with tachyarrhythmias, bradyarrhythmias, or conduction block depending on severity and context [^114P4LWm] [^113hTA5U].

> I should double-check how much I can rely on the ECG alone; the ECG is not sensitive to rule out hyperkalemia, especially in CKD or ESRD where adaptation can blunt typical findings, but it is highly specific as a rule-in test when characteristic changes like peaked T waves and QRS widening are present, which means that seeing these features justifies treating empirically while labs are pending rather than waiting for confirmation [^114QL8ph] [^115FYLdt] [^1111maU9].

> Next, I should review severity classification and urgency; per UKKA 2023 guidance, severe hyperkalemia is defined as serum potassium ≥ 6.5 mmol/L or the presence of ECG changes consistent with severe hyperkalemia, so the combination of peaked T waves and QRS widening meets criteria for urgent treatment even before the exact potassium value is known, mandating immediate cardioprotection and potassium shifting therapies with continuous monitoring [^112KvyxG] [^1151R4sV].

> Let me consider the differential to avoid anchoring; while acute coronary syndrome, bundle branch block, ventricular tachycardia, and digoxin toxicity can each produce wide-complex rhythms or T-wave changes, the simultaneous presence of symmetric peaked T waves with global QRS widening and neuromuscular weakness points first to hyperkalemia, and I should remember that hyperkalemia can mimic ischemia, even producing pseudoinfarct patterns with ST elevation, so rapid potassium assessment helps prevent unnecessary cath lab activation while life-saving hyperkalemia therapy proceeds [^115KhjSU] [^114JFp3S].

> I should identify contributing causes now, because treatment success and recurrence prevention hinge on this; in older adults, impaired renal excretion from CKD or AKI is common, and medications such as ACE inhibitors, ARBs, mineralocorticoid antagonists, potassium-sparing diuretics like amiloride or triamterene, beta-blockers, NSAIDs, and newer agents like finerenone frequently contribute, while endocrine causes like hypoaldosteronism and shifts from rhabdomyolysis or acidosis can add further elevation, and best practice is to mitigate hyperkalemia while preserving RAAS blockade when feasible using potassium-lowering strategies rather than reflexively discontinuing beneficial cardioprotective therapy [^114Kn5E2] [^114CF1FC] [^115RaXQt] [^113Mh4B2] [^116VQePY].

> I need to ensure we obtain the right diagnostics without delay; I will order immediate serum potassium with paired lithium heparin and clotted samples drawn from a large vein using gentle traction to minimize pseudohyperkalemia, request urea, creatinine, and eGFR to gauge renal function, obtain an arterial or venous blood gas to assess pH for acidosis, recheck serial ECGs given rapid evolution risk, and institute continuous telemetry in a higher-dependency setting while treatment is underway rather than after confirmation, given the ECG already suggests severe hyperkalemia [^111HtfMu] [^1124Vteu] [^1151R4sV].

> Let me verify the emergency treatment sequence and dosing, and correct myself if needed; first, administer intravenous calcium to stabilize the myocardium, selecting calcium gluconate for most ECG-positive cases and reserving calcium chloride for cardiac arrest or peri-arrest scenarios, then shift potassium intracellularly with IV insulin and dextrose using standard ED regimens such as 10 units of regular insulin with dextrose to prevent hypoglycemia, consider nebulized beta-agonist adjuncts if no contraindication, and give intravenous sodium bicarbonate if there is significant metabolic acidosis, while urgently stopping exogenous potassium and holding potassium-raising medications, and if refractory, in renal failure, or if severe with poor response, proceed to urgent hemodialysis, noting that potassium binders are adjunctive and, when chosen, patiromer is preferred to sodium polystyrene sulfonate due to efficacy and safety, although binders do not act fast enough to replace temporizing measures in this scenario [^1141xYzu] [^1179NdyX] [^112GKLLY] [^113zRHxZ] [^115LGsAq] [^1114vbYY] [^1156gGZL].

> But wait, I should also confirm disposition and follow-up safeguards; for any severe hyperkalemia detected outpatient, immediate hospital assessment and admission are recommended, and once stabilized, monitoring for rebound hyperkalemia and hypoglycemia after insulin is essential, with protocolized telemetry and serial potassium checks guiding de-escalation and discharge planning, including renal dosing review, medication reconciliation, and outpatient potassium monitoring given the high recurrence risk [^111pfUau] [^111rrGqp] [^1124Vteu].

> Next, I should review special populations and pitfalls; in advanced CKD, the ECG–potassium correlation is imperfect due to physiologic adaptation, so absence of classic changes cannot reassure, yet the presence of typical changes remains quite specific to rule in severe hyperkalemia and warrants action, and although bradycardia is classically highlighted, severe hyperkalemia can manifest with a wide range from bradyarrhythmias to malignant tachyarrhythmias or conduction blocks, which underscores the need for continuous monitoring during treatment [^1111maU9] [^115FYLdt] [^114QL8ph] [^114P4LWm].

> In synthesis, I should confirm that the most likely diagnosis is severe hyperkalemia explaining the triad of weakness, peaked T waves, and QRS widening in this 73-year-old, with immediate empiric therapy indicated based on ECG criteria alone while confirming serum potassium and evaluating causes, and I must remember digitalis considerations when rapidly lowering potassium and document the initial misinterpretation I corrected about the rhythm description to avoid repeating that error in future cases [^112KvyxG] [^113zRHxZ].

The most likely diagnosis is **hyperkalemia** due to the combination of **peaked T waves** and **wide QRS** on ECG [^113hTA5U] [^116rNj3M], especially in an older male with weakness and a regularly irregular rhythm. Other considerations include **bundle branch block**, **ventricular ectopy**, and **drug toxicity** (e.g. digoxin, sodium channel blockers), but hyperkalemia is the most urgent to exclude and treat [^112KvyxG].

---

## Differential diagnosis

### Electrolyte disturbances

Among electrolyte disturbances, **hyperkalemia** features peaked T waves, widened QRS complexes, and muscle weakness [^113hTA5U] [^116rNj3M]; it is commonly linked to renal impairment and use of ACE inhibitors, ARBs, potassium-sparing diuretics, or potassium supplements [^116z2yMe] [^114Kn5E2], whereas **hypokalemia** typically shows flat or inverted T waves with prominent U waves and is less likely given the ECG findings [^111QJpsS].

---

### Cardiac conduction abnormalities

- **Bundle branch block (BBB)**: Wide QRS complexes with normal P waves; may cause a regularly irregular rhythm due to intermittent conduction delay.

- **Ventricular ectopy (PVCs)**: Wide QRS complexes with compensatory pauses, causing a regularly irregular rhythm.

- **Atrial fibrillation with bundle branch block**: Irregularly irregular rhythm with broad QRS complexes; less likely given the regularly irregular rhythm described.

---

### Structural heart disease

Within structural heart disease, **left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH)** can cause repolarization abnormalities, including prominent T waves, but is typically accompanied by increased QRS voltage, whereas **ischemic heart disease** may present with broad QRS complexes and T-wave abnormalities but usually includes other ischemic changes [^117BK5xi].

---

### Drug toxicity

In the context of drug toxicity, **digoxin toxicity** can cause wide QRS complexes, T-wave abnormalities, and arrhythmias and is often associated with hyperkalemia, whereas **sodium channel blocker toxicity (e.g. tricyclic antidepressants)** causes wide QRS complexes and arrhythmias.

---

### Metabolic disturbances

Regarding metabolic disturbances, **acidosis** can precipitate hyperkalemia with associated ECG changes [^114dKtnY], and **renal failure** is commonly linked to hyperkalemia and similar ECG findings [^113hTA5U].

---

## Clinical correlation and recommended evaluation

Given the patient's age, presentation, and ECG findings, **hyperkalemia** is the most likely and immediately life-threatening diagnosis [^114RnHW7]. Immediate evaluation should include:

- **Serum potassium level**: Urgent measurement to confirm hyperkalemia [^113hTA5U].

- **Renal function tests**: Assess for acute or chronic renal impairment [^114dKtnY].

- **Medication review**: Identify potential contributors to hyperkalemia (e.g. ACE inhibitors, ARBs, potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements) [^116z2yMe] [^114Kn5E2].

- **Continuous cardiac monitoring**: Monitor for arrhythmias and initiate immediate treatment if hyperkalemia is confirmed [^1124Vteu] [^112KvyxG].

## Summary table of differential diagnosis

| **Category** | **Diagnosis** | **Key features** | **Likelihood** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Electrolyte disturbance | Hyperkalemia | Peaked T waves, wide QRS, muscle weakness | High |
| Electrolyte disturbance | Hypokalemia | Flat T waves, prominent U waves, muscle weakness | Low |
| Cardiac conduction | Bundle branch block | Wide QRS, normal P waves, regularly irregular rhythm | Moderate |
| Cardiac conduction | Ventricular ectopy | Wide QRS, compensatory pauses, regularly irregular rhythm | Moderate |
| Structural heart disease | LVH | Repolarization abnormalities, increased QRS voltage | Low |
| Drug toxicity | Digoxin toxicity | Wide QRS, T wave abnormalities, arrhythmias | Moderate |
| Metabolic disturbance | Acidosis, renal failure | Hyperkalemia, ECG changes | High |

Among the various causes, increased serum potassium can result from:

- **Metabolic and respiratory disorders**: Respiratory acidosis, metabolic acidosis
- **Endocrine and pseudohyperkalemia conditions**: Adrenal insufficiency, pseudohyperkalemia, hypoaldosteronism
- **Injury-related and muscle breakdown conditions**: Crush injury, burn injury, rhabdomyolysis

- **Renal and genetic conditions**: Acute kidney injury, hyperkalemic distal renal tubular acidosis, chronic kidney disease, familial pseudohyperkalaemia
- **Temperature and metabolic rate disorders**: Malignant hyperthermia, hypothermia, hyperkalemic periodic paralysis

Additionally, increased serum potassium can be caused by medications such as:

- **Potassium-sparing diuretics and antagonists**: Triamterene, spironolactone, eplerenone, amiloride
- **Angiotensin receptor blockers and related medications**: Losartan, olmesartan, candesartan, valsartan, aliskiren, losartan/hydrochlorothiazide, sacubitril/valsartan
- **ACE inhibitors**: Captopril, lisinopril/hydrochlorothiazide, enalapril, moexipril
- **Calcium-related medications**: Etelcalcetide
- **NSAIDs and COX inhibitors**: Ketoprofen, indomethacin, ibuprofen, celecoxib, diclofenac sodium
- **Anesthetics and muscle relaxants**: Succinylcholine, isoflurane, propofol, landiolol

### Potassium disorders: Hypokalemia and hyperkalemia [^113hTA5U]. American Family Physician (2015). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on hyperkalemia:

- **Definition**: Hyperkalemia is defined as an increase in serum potassium levels > 5.0 mmol/L.

- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of hyperkalemia involves disruptions in potassium balance due to excess potassium intake, impaired potassium excretion, or transcellular shifts. The etiology is often multifactorial, with impaired renal function, medication use, and hyperglycemia being the most common contributors.

- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of hyperkalemia in the US is estimated at 1,550 per 100,000 population.

- **Disease course**: Mild and moderate hyperkalemia are usually asymptomatic. Severe cases may manifest as muscle weakness, ascending paralysis, heart palpitations, and paresthesias. ECG changes associated with hyperkalemia include peaked T waves, P-wave flattening, PR-interval prolongation, widening of the QRS complex, and sine waves.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of hyperkalemia is dependent on the severity of the condition and the promptness of treatment. Severe untreated hyperkalemia can lead to life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias and cardiac arrest.

### Potassium disorders: Hypokalemia and hyperkalemia [^116z2yMe]. American Family Physician (2015). High credibility.

Hyperkalemia can be associated with several conditions and substances. These include mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, tumor lysis syndrome, and Addison's disease. Patients might experience symptoms such as palpitations, cardiac arrhythmias, muscle cramps, nausea, vomiting, and chest pain. There are also specific electrocardiogram (ECG) changes noted, such as decreased P wave amplitude, increased QRS duration, and peaked T waves, among others.

- **Related factors**:
	- **Past medical history**: Recent diarrheal illness, excessive vomiting, diabetes mellitus, sickle cell disease, myocardial infarction, chronic kidney disease (CKD), heart failure (HF), alcohol use disorder, and acute kidney injury (AKI).
	- **Medications**: Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEis), epithelial sodium channel blockers, trimethoprim, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), direct renin inhibitors, digoxin, and calcineurin inhibitors.
	- **Additional conditions**: Ascending paralysis, atrioventricular (AV) block, hyperreflexia, rhabdomyolysis, ileus, muscle weakness, P wave flattening, and paresthesia.

In severe cases, hyperkalemia can lead to life-threatening conditions such as cardiac arrest.

### A physiologic-based approach to the evaluation of a patient with hyperkalemia [^114dKtnY]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Hyperkalemia generally is attributable to cell shifts or abnormal renal potassium excretion. Cell shifts account for transient increases in serum potassium levels, whereas sustained hyperkalemia generally is caused by decreased renal potassium excretion. Impaired renal potassium excretion can be caused by a primary decrease in distal sodium delivery, a primary decrease in mineralocorticoid level or activity, or abnormal cortical collecting duct function. Excessive potassium intake is an infrequent cause of hyperkalemia by itself but can worsen the severity of hyperkalemia when renal excretion is impaired. Before concluding that a cell shift or renal defect in potassium excretion is present, pseudohyperkalemia should be excluded.

### Clinical practice guidelines treatment of acute hyperkalaemia in adults [^1179NdyX]. UKKA (2023). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for hyperkalemia, particularly in patients experiencing cardiac arrest, the UKKA 2023 guidelines recommend suspecting hyperkalemia in all such cases. This is part of identifying and treating a reversible cause using the 4Hs (hypoxia, hypokalemia/hyperkalemia, hypothermia/hyperthermia, hypovolemia) and 4Ts (tension pneumothorax, tamponade, thrombosis, toxins) approach.

### Potassium disorders: Hypokalemia and hyperkalemia [^113YChVW]. American Family Physician (2023). High credibility.

Regarding the screening and diagnosis of hyperkalemia, particularly concerning indications for screening and patients at risk, the AAFP 2023 guidelines recommend routine serum potassium level monitoring in patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD) or chronic kidney disease (CKD), especially if the potassium level is 5 mEq/L or higher.

### Effects of presentation and electrocardiogram on time to treatment of hyperkalemia [^114y6bmm]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to assess the time to treatment for emergency department (ED) patients with critical hyperkalemia. The study aimed to determine whether the timing of treatment was associated with clinical characteristics or electrocardiographic abnormalities.

Methods involved a retrospective chart review of ED patients diagnosed with hyperkalemia (potassium level > 6.0 mmol/L). Patients presenting in cardiac arrest or referred for hyperkalemia or dialysis were excluded. The review focused on whether patients received specific treatment for hyperkalemia and what clinical attributes were associated with the time to initiation of treatment.

Of the 175 ED visits over a one-year period, 168 (96%) received specific treatment for hyperkalemia. The median time from triage to the initiation of treatment was 117 minutes (interquartile range [IQR] = 59 to 196 minutes). In 7 cases where hyperkalemia was not treated, 4 patients were discharged home, resulting in a missed diagnosis of hyperkalemia. Despite specific therapy initiation in 168 cases, 2 patients succumbed to cardiac arrhythmias. Among treated patients, 15% had a documented systolic blood pressure (sBP) < 90 mmHg, and 30% were admitted to intensive care units. The median potassium value was 6.5 mmol/L (IQR = 6.3 to 7.1 mmol/L). Predominant complaints included dyspnea (20%) and weakness (19%), with 36% of patients taking angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors.

### Clinical characteristics and electrophysiological mechanisms underlying Brugada ECG in patients with severe hyperkalemia [^1173XX1o]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

The main findings of this study are as follows:

- **Association with arrhythmias and mortality**: In patients with severe hyperkalemia resulting from a critical medical condition, the presence of a Brugada syndrome (BrS) phenotype is associated with a high prevalence of malignant arrhythmias and all-cause mortality.

- **Transient nature of ECG changes**: In surviving patients, the characteristic Brugada ECG changes are transient and disappear when the serum potassium (K+) levels normalize.

- **Hyperkalemia-induced BrS manifestations**: In patients with Brugada syndrome, hyperkalemia may elicit the typical Brugada syndrome ECG manifestations.

- **Predictors of Brugada phenotype (BrPh) ECG**: Higher serum K+ levels and male sex were independent predictors for the presence of BrPh ECG in patients with severe hyperkalemia.

- **Mechanisms underlying ECG changes**: As shown by the response to adenosine infusion and computer simulations, ECG manifestations of systemic hyperkalemia are a consequence of the depolarized resting membrane potential and reduced sodium-channel availability for action potential activation. This results in delayed and heterogeneous conduction or block, particularly in the presence of fibrosis at the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT).

### Potassium citrate extended release [^117VkPrd]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Treatment of overdosage: The administration of potassium salts to individuals without predisposing conditions for hyperkalemia rarely results in serious hyperkalemia when dosed as recommended. It is crucial to acknowledge that hyperkalemia is generally asymptomatic and may only be indicated by an increased serum potassium concentration and specific electrocardiographic alterations, including the peaking of the T-wave, loss of the P-wave, depression of the S-T segment, and prolongation of the QT interval. Advanced symptoms can include muscle paralysis and cardiovascular collapse due to cardiac arrest.

- **Treatment measures for hyperkalemia include the following**:

	- **Monitoring and elimination**: Patients should be closely monitored for arrhythmias and electrolyte changes. Eliminate medications containing potassium and agents with potassium-sparing properties such as potassium-sparing diuretics, ARBs, ACE inhibitors, NSAIDs, and certain nutritional supplements.

	- **Dietary restrictions**:
		- **Fruits and juices**: Almonds, apricots, bananas, cantaloupe, figs, grapefruit juice
		- **Vegetables and grains**: Beans (lima, pinto, white), canned carrot juice, oat bran, potatoes (with skin), spinach
		- **Proteins and other**: Halibut, milk, salmon, tuna

	- **Intravenous treatments**:
		- Administer intravenous calcium gluconate if the patient is at no risk or low risk for developing digitalis toxicity.
		- Provide intravenous administration of 300–500 mL/hr of 10% dextrose solution containing 10–20 units of crystalline insulin per 1,000 mL.
		- Correct acidosis, if present, with intravenous sodium bicarbonate.

	- **Renal replacement therapies**: Utilize hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis.

	- **Exchange resins**: Employ exchange resins; however, this measure alone is insufficient.

This comprehensive approach ensures effective management of hyperkalemia, minimizing risks associated with overdosage.

### How dangerous is hyperkalemia [^1179Cqu6]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Hyperkalemia is a potentially life-threatening electrolyte disorder observed with greater frequency in patients with renal disease, heart failure, and with the use of medications such as renin-angiotensin-aldosterone inhibitors. Traditional views suggesting that hyperkalemia can be reliably diagnosed by electrocardiogram, and that specific levels of hyperkalemia confer cardiotoxic risk, have been challenged by reports of patients with atypical presentations. Epidemiologic data demonstrate strong associations of morbidity and mortality in patients with hyperkalemia; however, these associations appear inconsistent in certain patient populations and differing clinical presentations.

Physiologic adaptation, structural cardiac disease, medication use, and the degree of concurrent illness might predispose certain patients presenting with hyperkalemia to a lower or higher threshold for toxicity. These factors are often overlooked, yet data suggest that the clinical context in which hyperkalemia develops is at least as important as the degree of hyperkalemia in determining patient outcomes. This review summarizes the clinical data linking hyperkalemia with poor outcomes and discusses how the efficacy of certain treatments might depend on the clinical presentation.

### Potassium chloride for oral solution [^112GKLLY]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Symptoms**: The administration of oral potassium salts to persons with normal excretory mechanisms for potassium rarely causes serious hyperkalemia. However, if excretory mechanisms are impaired or if potassium is administered too rapidly, potentially fatal hyperkalemia can result. Hyperkalemia is usually asymptomatic and may be manifested only by an increased serum potassium concentration (6.5–8.0 mEq/L) and characteristic electrocardiographic changes, such as peaking of T-waves, loss of P-waves, depression of the S-T segment, and prolongation of the QT-interval. Late manifestations include muscle paralysis and cardiovascular collapse from cardiac arrest (9–12 mEq/L).

- **Treatment**: Treatment measures for hyperkalemia include the following:
	1. Monitor closely for arrhythmias and electrolyte changes.
	2. Eliminate foods and medications containing potassium and any agents with potassium-sparing properties, such as potassium-sparing diuretics, ARBs, ACE inhibitors, NSAIDs, certain nutritional supplements, and many others.
	3. Administer intravenous calcium gluconate if the patient is at no risk or low risk of developing digitalis toxicity.
	4. Administer intravenously 300 to 500 mL/hr of 10% dextrose solution containing 10 to 20 units of crystalline insulin per 1,000 mL.
	5. Correct acidosis, if present, with intravenous sodium bicarbonate.
	6. Use exchange resins, hemodialysis, or peritoneal dialysis.

In patients who have been stabilized on digitalis, too rapid a lowering of the serum potassium concentration can produce digitalis toxicity.

### Can physicians detect hyperkalemia based on the electrocardiogram [^114QL8ph]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Although there is no consensus on how to use an electrocardiogram (ECG) in patients with hyperkalemia, physicians often obtain it in the acute setting when diagnosing and treating hyperkalemia. This study aims to evaluate if physicians are able to detect hyperkalemia based on the ECG.

- **Methods**: The study was conducted at a large county hospital with a population of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients who received hemodialysis (HD) solely on an emergent basis. Five hundred twenty-eight ECGs from ESRD patients were evaluated. The prevalence of hyperkalemia was approximately 60% in this cohort, with at least half of them in the severe hyperkalemia range (K ≥ 6.5 mEq/L).

- **Results**: The mean sensitivity and specificity of emergency physicians detecting hyperkalemia were 0.19 (± 0.16) and 0.97 (± 0.04), respectively. The mean positive predictive value of evaluators for detecting hyperkalemia was 0.92 (± 0.13) and the mean negative predictive value was 0.46 (± 0.05). In severe hyperkalemia (K ≥ 6.5 mEq/L), the mean sensitivity improved to 0.29 (± 0.20), while specificity decreased to 0.95 (± 0.07).

An ECG is not a sensitive method of detecting hyperkalemia and should not be relied upon to rule it out. However, the ECG has a high specificity for detecting hyperkalemia and could be used as a rule-in test.

### Potassium disorders: Hypokalemia and hyperkalemia [^111QJpsS]. American Family Physician (2015). High credibility.

The following provides essential background information on hypokalemia:

- **Definition**: Hypokalemia is characterized by serum potassium levels less than 3.6 mmol/L.
- **Pathophysiology**: Potassium depletion can occur due to inadequate dietary intake, increased renal excretion (e.g. resulting from diuretic therapy), or heightened gastrointestinal losses, particularly through diarrhea.
- **Epidemiology**: Hypokalemia is the most frequently encountered electrolyte disorder in clinical practice.
- **Disease course**: Symptoms of hypokalemia include muscle weakness, ileus, and cardiac arrhythmias. Electrocardiographic changes typically observed are flat or inverted T waves, ST-segment depression, and prominent U waves.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Severe untreated hypokalemia can result in rhabdomyolysis and life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias, such as ventricular tachycardia (VT) and ventricular fibrillation (VF).

### Worsening Wenckebach after calcium gluconate injection: Not uncommon but frequently missed diagnosis [^1125VMVi]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

The objective of the study is to demonstrate a common etiology of hyperkalemia and illustrate potential iatrogenic errors in treatment.

### The clinical significance of hyperkalaemia-associated repolarization abnormalities in end-stage renal disease [^117BK5xi]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2013). Low credibility.

Hyperkalaemia is a common and potentially fatal complication of chronic kidney disease (CKD). It may manifest as electrocardiogram (ECG) changes, the earliest of which is T-wave "tenting". However, this occurs in less than half of hyperkalaemia episodes. The aim of this study was to determine what other clinical features relate to the probability of T-wave tenting and whether there is a longer-term survival difference between patients who develop tenting and those who do not.

- **Method**: One hundred and forty-five patients with end-stage renal disease who had standard 12-lead ECG and serum potassium measurement were enrolled. The presence of tenting and the ratio of the amplitude of the tallest precordial T-wave and R-wave were determined (T:R).

- **Results**: Tenting was as common in normal range serum potassium as in hyperkalaemia (33% versus 31%) and less common than in left ventricular hypertrophy (44%). T:R was less sensitive (24% versus 33%) but more specific (85% versus 67%) than tenting for correctly identifying hyperkalaemia ≥ 6.0 mmol/L. Tenting became less common with increasing age. Dialysis patients were more likely to show increased T:R than pre-dialysis Stage 5 CKD. Elevated T:R was not associated with worse cardiovascular outcomes but was associated with an increased risk of sudden death over a mean follow-up of 3.8 years (hazard ratio = 8.3, P = 0.021).

- **Conclusions**: The reason for the variability in T-wave changes is not clear. The ratio of precordial T-wave to R-wave amplitude is a more specific measure than tenting, but both are poorly sensitive at detecting hyperkalaemia.

### Potassium chloride [^113zRHxZ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Overdosage**: The administration of oral potassium salts to individuals with normal excretory mechanisms for potassium rarely causes serious hyperkalemia. However, if excretory mechanisms are impaired or if potassium is administered too rapidly, potentially fatal hyperkalemia can result.

- **Symptoms**: Hyperkalemia is usually asymptomatic and may be manifested only by an increased serum potassium concentration (6.5 to 8.0 mEq/L) and characteristic electrocardiographic changes, such as the peaking of T-waves, loss of P-waves, depression of the S-T segment, and prolongation of the QT interval. Late manifestations include muscle paralysis and cardiovascular collapse from cardiac arrest (9 to 12 mEq/L).

- **Treatment**: Treatment measures for hyperkalemia include the following:
	- Monitor closely for arrhythmias and electrolyte changes.
	- Eliminate foods and medications containing potassium and any agents with potassium-sparing properties, such as potassium-sparing diuretics, ARBs, ACE inhibitors, NSAIDs, certain nutritional supplements, and many others.
	- Administer intravenous calcium gluconate if the patient is at no risk or low risk of developing digitalis toxicity.
	- Administer intravenously 300 to 500 mL/hr of 10% dextrose solution containing 10 to 20 units of crystalline insulin per 1,000 mL.
	- Correct acidosis, if present, with intravenous sodium bicarbonate.
	- Use exchange resins, hemodialysis, or peritoneal dialysis.

In patients who have been stabilized on digitalis, too rapid a lowering of the serum potassium concentration can produce digitalis toxicity.

### Clinical practice guidelines treatment of acute hyperkalaemia in adults [^111LFAxS]. UKKA (2023). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for hyperkalemia, particularly in patients with cardiac arrest, the UKKA 2023 guidelines recommend administering IV calcium chloride if hyperkalemia is the known or suspected cause of cardiac arrest. Calcium chloride is preferred in resuscitation settings, such as during cardiac arrest or peri-arrest.

### Diovan [^115RaXQt]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Some patients with heart failure have developed increases in potassium. These effects are usually minor and transient, and they are more likely to occur in patients with pre-existing renal impairment. Dosage reduction and/or discontinuation of Diovan may be required [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

### Hyperkalemia is associated with increased mortality among unselected cardiac intensive care unit patients [^114ndiGF]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

Although the association between hyperkalemia and adverse outcomes in this population may be explained by direct harmful effects of elevated potassium levels, we hypothesize that elevated potassium levels more likely serve as a marker to identify high-risk patients with higher illness severity or more severe comorbidities. Potassium is essential for normal cardiac myocyte function, including impulse conduction and coordinated myocardial contraction. As such, disturbances in potassium levels can predispose patients to arrhythmia, which may account for the increased mortality rate and more frequent arrhythmia diagnoses seen in our patients with hypokalemia and hyperkalemia. However, we observed an increase in mortality at mildly elevated potassium levels below those usually associated with direct cardiac toxicity, indicating that arrhythmia alone is not the primary reason for the increase in mortality seen in our population.

Our patients with hypokalemia and hyperkalemia had higher illness severity; patients with hyperkalemia also had worse renal function. This implies that potassium abnormalities identify sicker patients with an increased risk of mortality, and the effects of hypokalemia on mortality appeared to be mediated primarily by illness severity. Hyperkalemia remained associated with higher short- and long-term mortality after adjustment for illness severity and markers of renal function, implying that hyperkalemia may identify patients with more dangerous forms of renal dysfunction.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for hyperkalemia, more specifically with respect to indications for monitoring (history of hyperkalemia), the UKKA 2023 guidelines recommend obtaining a repeat serum potassium measurement within one day of an episode of moderate hyperkalemia (serum potassium 6.0–6.4 mmol/L) when detected in the outpatient setting.

### Hyperkalemia: pathophysiology, risk factors and consequences [^112zroik]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2019). Low credibility.

An increase in extracellular potassium concentration ([K⁺]) has several consequences for the myocardial action potential (AP), driven by depolarization of the resting potential (RP) and activation of inward rectifier potassium channels (carrying currents I_K₁ and I_Kr).

- **Mechanism of cardiac arrhythmia in hyperkalemia**: In normokalemia, the cell membrane of the cardiomyocyte is polarized with a resting potential around −90 mV. In moderate hyperkalemia, the cell membrane becomes partially depolarized, bringing the resting potential closer to the threshold potential for AP initiation. Thus, fast sodium channels (Na_v1.5) are activated more readily, increasing excitability and conduction velocity. This manifests as T wave peaking on the ECG as a mass of ventricular cardiomyocytes undergo synchronous early repolarization. In severe hyperkalemia, voltage-dependent inactivation of Na_v1.5 channels and activation of inwardly rectifying potassium channels (K_ir) lead to reductions in conduction velocity and can render cells refractory to excitation. This manifests as broadening of ECG complexes and/or conduction blocks. This figure represents an idealized model, as there is poor correlation between ECG features and the degree of hyperkalemia.

Depolarization of the RP exerts a biphasic effect on myocardial excitability and conduction velocity. Modest increases in [K⁺] (up to approximately 8 mM) enhance excitability and conduction velocity as the RP moves closer to the threshold potential for AP initiation via activation of voltage-gated Na⁺ channels (Na <sub> v </sub> 1.5).

### Long-term mortality and trajectory of potassium measurements following an episode of acute severe hyperkalaemia [^113v2U48]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2022). Low credibility.

Concerning the EKG abnormalities and despite the limitations of the study, we can add that a previous study that included 188 episodes of severe hyperkalaemia (sK ≥ 6.5 mEq/L), using a very robust methodology for EKG abnormalities, showed that 71% of the episodes had at least one EKG abnormality suggestive of hyperkalaemia, with the two most common findings being QRS prolongation (43%) and peaked T waves (30%). These data are similar to those shown in our study.

The management of an acute episode of hyperkalaemia is well-established. However, the evidence endorsing the frequency of monitoring and the optimal medical treatment to avoid recurrences and the occurrence of adverse clinical outcomes remains not well defined. Recently, new approaches have been made in a summary from the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes conference about the handling of acute hyperkalaemia in the emergency department, reinforcing the idea that frequent re-evaluation of serum potassium concentrations is essential to follow the treatment success and screen for a rebound rise of serum potassium after an episode of severe hyperkalaemia and during the follow-up.

### Hyperkalemia: pathophysiology, risk factors and consequences [^113DtGn3]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2019). Low credibility.

Patients receiving dialysis experience unique challenges due to hyperkalemia. This condition is prevalent among this group, with pre-dialysis serum [K⁺] levels exceeding 5.5 mM in approximately 20% of hemodialysis patients. Such patients also often suffer from comorbidities that increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmia and death, like left ventricular hypertrophy.

For individuals undergoing maintenance hemo- and peritoneal dialysis, hyperkalemia has been linked to an elevated risk of all-cause mortality, cardiac arrhythmia, and hospitalization. In particular, the risks associated with hyperkalemia might be heightened during prolonged interdialytic intervals. An observational study involving over 50,000 hemodialysis patients identified that hyperkalemia (pre-dialysis levels > 5.5 mM) correlated with a heightened risk of hospitalization in the subsequent four days. This risk peaked for [K⁺] measurements taken on a Friday, prior to a three-day interdialytic interval, compared to measurements taken on a Monday or Wednesday, before a two-day interval.

- **Changes in prescribing practice**: The presence of hyperkalemia can influence prescribing behaviors. Physicians and patients might avoid certain medications as a precautionary measure. For example, in a Swedish registry encompassing more than 11,000 heart failure patients, only 40% of those eligible were prescribed a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA). Additionally, a study involving 80,000 patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) estimated a "treatment gap", indicating the proportion of eligible patients not receiving recommended treatments.

### Management of hyperkalemia: An update for the internist [^112sDH5S]. The American Journal of Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Hyperkalemia is a clinically important electrolyte abnormality that occurs most commonly in patients with chronic kidney disease. Due to its propensity to induce electrophysiological disturbances, severe hyperkalemia is considered a medical emergency. The management of acute and chronic hyperkalemia can be achieved through the implementation of various interventions, one of which is the elimination of medications that can raise serum potassium levels. Because many such medications, especially inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, have shown beneficial effects in patients with cardiovascular and renal disease, their discontinuation for reasons of hyperkalemia represents an undesirable clinical compromise. The emergence of two new potassium-binding medications for acute and chronic therapy of hyperkalemia may soon allow the continued use of medications such as renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors even in patients who are prone to hyperkalemia.

This review article provides an overview of the physiology and the pathophysiology of potassium metabolism and hyperkalemia, the epidemiology of hyperkalemia, and its acute and chronic management. We discuss in detail emerging data about new potassium-lowering therapies and their potential future role in clinical practice.

### Hyperkalaemia among hospital admissions: Prevalence, risk factors, treatment and impact on length of stay [^115zrMgS]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Low credibility.

Hyperkalaemia is one of the common electrolyte disorders among hospital patients, affected by many risk factors including medications and medical conditions. Prompt treatment is important given its impact on patient mortality and morbidity, which can lead to negative patient outcomes and healthcare resource utilisation. This study aims to describe the prevalence, characteristics, and treatment of patients admitted to hospitals with hyperkalaemia and compare findings between patients with kidney failure on maintenance haemodialysis therapy and patients without kidney failure. It also aims to identify associations between hyperkalaemia and hospital length of stay.

- **Methods**: We undertook a retrospective cohort study on adult patients admitted to Townsville University Hospital between 1st January 2018 and 31st December 2022 (n = 99,047). Patients were included if they had a serum potassium result of 5.1 mmol/L and above during their admission/s. Statistical analysis was conducted using several methods. A Welch's t test and Chi-square test were employed to assess differences between groups of patients with kidney failure on maintenance haemodialysis therapy and those without kidney failure. For comparison among multiple groups with varying severities of hyperkalaemia, the Kruskal-Wallis test with Mann-Whitney U test and logistic regression were used.

- **Results**: 8,775 hyperkalaemic patients were included in the study, with a mean age of 64.7 years. The prevalence of hyperkalaemia was 8.9% of patients. Risk factors for hyperkalaemia were highly prevalent among those who h

### Non-convulsive status epilepticus possibly induced by a rapid correction of severe hyperkalemia: A case report and literature review [^113xmXEa]. BMC Nephrology (2023). High credibility.

Patients with chronic kidney disease frequently develop neurological complications, including confusion and altered consciousness. Non-convulsive status epilepticus (NCSE), characterized by a change in behavior and/or mental processes accompanied by epileptiform discharges on electroencephalogram in the absence of convulsive seizures, is one of the overlooked causes of altered consciousness. The incidence and precise pathophysiological mechanism of NCSE in patients with kidney disease, particularly in those with electrolyte disturbances, remain unknown. We recently treated an older patient with chronic kidney disease and severe hyperkalemia in whom NCSE developed following a correction of severe hyperkalemia.

- **Case presentation**: An 82-year-old male was admitted to our hospital at midnight because of weakness in all four limbs (Day 1). He underwent urgent hemodialysis for severe hyperkalemia (9.84 mEq/L), and his serum potassium concentration decreased to 4.97 mEq/L. He regained full consciousness and his limb weakness improved on the morning of Day 2, but he became confused in the evening. Electroencephalogram revealed repeated low-voltage ictal discharges in the right occipital region, and a diagnosis of NCSE was made. Following medication with fosphenytoin and phenytoin, the patient became fully alert and oriented on Day 8.

- **Conclusion**: We speculate that a rapid correction of hyperkalemia was the possible cause of NCSE development.

### Potassium chloride [^114P4LWm]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Potassium overdose can cause potentially fatal hyperkalemia. Manifestations of hyperkalemia include disturbances in cardiac conduction and arrhythmias, such as bradycardia, heart block, asystole, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation; hypotension; muscle weakness, up to and including muscular and respiratory paralysis and paresthesia; and gastrointestinal symptoms like ileus, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain.

Frequently, mild or moderate hyperkalemia is asymptomatic and may be manifested only by increased serum potassium concentrations and possibly characteristic electrocardiographic changes. However, fatal arrhythmias can develop at any time.

In addition to arrhythmias and conduction disorders, the EKG shows progressive changes that occur with increasing potassium levels. Possible changes include the peaking of T waves, loss of P waves, and QRS widening. However, the correlation between potassium levels and EKG changes is not precise, and whether or at which potassium level certain EKG signs develop depends on factors such as patient sensitivity, the presence of other electrolyte disorders, and the rapidity of the development of hyperkalemia.

The presence of any EKG findings suspected to be caused by hyperkalemia should be considered a medical emergency. In the event of hyperkalemia, discontinue the infusion immediately and institute close EKG, laboratory, and other monitoring. As necessary, implement corrective therapy to reduce serum potassium levels. The use of potassium-containing foods or medications must also be eliminated.

### Hyperkalemia in heart failure: Probably not O"K" [^111b1mZi]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Hyperkalemia is routinely defined as a serum potassium level > 5 mmol/L and is a common occurrence in patients with acute and chronic heart failure (HF). For example, prior work has demonstrated that hyperkalemia is present in approximately 9% of patients admitted for acute HF, and the total annual charges for Medicare admissions related to a primary diagnosis of hyperkalemia are substantial, with estimates as high as $697 million in 2011. Elevated potassium levels may affect the activity of myocardial potassium channels, leading to more rapid membrane depolarization. The downstream effects of this may translate into slower myocardial electrical conduction, resulting in malignant tachyarrhythmias or bradyarrhythmias. Hyperkalemia, especially with potassium levels > 5.5 mmol/L, has been consistently linked to poor clinical outcomes in patients with HF.

Recent estimates from the PARADIGM-HF (Prospective Comparison of ARNI With ACEI to Determine Impact on Global Mortality and Morbidity in Heart Failure) trial suggest the incidence of hyperkalemia in a trial population receiving treatment with renin-angiotensin system inhibition (RASi) was approximately 16% over a median follow-up time of 27 months, despite a highly selected and carefully monitored clinical trial population. Similarly, in a large cohort from the United Kingdom of 19,194 patients with new-onset HF, 11% developed hyperkalemia during a 4-year follow-up. Multiple prior analyses of clinical trials and population-based studies identify renal dysfunction, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and the use of mineralocorticoid antagonists (MRAs) as significant factors.

### Tetraparesis and failure of pacemaker capture induced by severe hyperkalemia: Case report and systematic review of available literature [^1119XnnH]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

In severe hyperkalemia, neurologic symptoms are described more rarely than cardiac manifestations. We report a clinical case, present a systematic review of available literature on secondary hyperkalemic paralysis (SHP), and also discuss pathogenesis, clinical effects, and therapeutic options.

- **Case report**: A 75-year-old woman presented to the emergency department complaining of tetraparesis. Her serum potassium level was 11.4 mEq/L. Electrocardiogram (ECG) showed a pacemaker (PMK)-induced rhythm, with loss of atrial capture and wide QRS complexes. After emergency treatment to restore cell membrane potential threshold and lower serum potassium, neurologic and ECG signs completely disappeared. An acute myocardial infarction subsequently occurred, possibly linked to tachycardia induced by salbutamol therapy.

- **Literature review**: We reviewed 99 articles (119 patients). Mean serum potassium was 8.8 mEq/L. In most cases, ECG showed the presence of tall T waves, and loss of PMK atrial capture was documented in 5 patients. In 94 patients, flaccid paralysis was described, and in 25, severe muscular weakness; in 65 patients, these findings were associated with other symptoms. Renal failure was often documented. The most frequent treatments were dialysis and infusion of insulin and glucose. Eighty-seven percent of patients had complete resolution of symptoms.

- **Conclusion**: Why should an emergency physician be aware of this? Severe hyperkalemia is always a life-threatening medical emergency, as it can precipitate fatal dysrhythmias and paralysis. SHP should be considered in the differential diagnosis.

After matching, the MACE+ sample included 5,301 matched pairs, and the hospitalized arrhythmia sample included 5,564 matched pairs. The mean follow-up duration was 26.8 months for the MACE+ sample (median 26.4 months) and 26.5 months for the hospitalized arrhythmia sample (median 25.9 months). Table S2 shows the number of matched pairs for the MACE sample and each of the substudy analyses.

### Novel bloodless potassium determination using a signal-processed single-lead ECG [^116qjMaA]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). High credibility.

In patients with cardiovascular and/or renal disease, hyperkalemia is frequent, life-threatening, and usually asymptomatic. The emergence of safe and effective medications that lower potassium underscores the importance of detection of hyperkalemia. The ability to remotely, unobtrusively, frequently, and noninvasively assess potassium through a single-channel signal-processed ECG would permit currently available wireless ECG patches, implanted monitors, and cardiac devices to infer measurements of potassium. This would address a critical need and affect a large population.

In this study of patients undergoing hemodialysis, the signal-processed ECG was able to calculate potassium values with a mean error of 0.36 ± 0.34 mmol/L using a personalized strategy that required a seeding blood test, providing a clinically meaningful value via individualized medicine. Importantly, even without personalization and in the absence of any blood draws, clinically useful estimates of potassium were obtained, providing potassium values with a mean error of 0.5 ± 0.42 mmol/L, and could be useful for alerts and trending. These findings, using a single lead of high-resolution ECG data, suggest that this approach may be suitable for remotely monitoring potassium in dialysis patients. This population is at high risk for hyperkalemia and sudden death, often in the 12 hours before a dialysis session, suggesting a hyperkalemic mechanism.

### Dyrenium [^114YvxyJ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Laboratory tests**: Hyperkalemia will rarely occur in patients with adequate urinary output, but it is a possibility if large doses are used for considerable periods of time. If hyperkalemia is observed, Dyrenium (triamterene) should be withdrawn. The normal adult range of serum potassium is 3.5 to 5.0 mEq per liter, with 4.5 mEq often being used as a reference point. Potassium levels persistently above 6 mEq per liter require careful observation and treatment. Normal potassium levels tend to be higher in neonates (7.7 mEq per liter) than in adults.

Serum potassium levels do not necessarily indicate true body potassium concentration. A rise in plasma pH may cause a decrease in plasma potassium concentration and an increase in intracellular potassium concentration. Because Dyrenium conserves potassium, it has been theorized that in patients who have received intensive therapy or been given the drug for prolonged periods, a rebound kaliuresis could occur upon abrupt withdrawal. In such patients, withdrawal of Dyrenium should be gradual.

- **Results and conclusions**: A more complete understanding of potassium homeostasis in recent years has led to new approaches to the management of severe hyperkalemia. The physiologically based sequential approach still applies. The efficacy, pitfalls, and risks of the agents available for use at each step in the sequence are critically reviewed.

### Hyperkalaemia mimics pseudostemi infarct pattern [^114JFp3S]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). Low credibility.

Hyperkalaemia is an electrolyte abnormality that warrants urgent intervention and has well-recognised electrocardiographic changes. A peaking T wave is the most appreciated ECG sign, but hyperkalaemia manifesting electrocardiographically as acute ischemia with ST segment elevation is a very rare condition. We present a case of acute kidney injury complicated by severe hyperkalaemia, causing ST segment elevation changes in an ECG that simulate acute myocardial infarction.

Rapid determination of serum potassium levels through an arterial blood gases blood test guided treatment in this case, preventing unnecessary activation of the catheterisation lab and, more importantly, saving the patient from malignant dysrhythmia in case of treatment delay. Aggressive treatment of hyperkalaemia resulted in a successful reduction of serum potassium levels, with ECG changes returning to baseline without any evidence of a pseudoinfarction pattern.

Medical staff should be aware of this condition to administer the correct therapy and prevent unnecessary interventions and the associated risk of complications.

### Kerendia [^113Mh4B2]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

- **Warnings and precautions**: Hyperkalemia is a significant concern. Patients with decreased kidney function and higher baseline potassium levels face increased risk. It is essential to monitor serum potassium levels and adjust the dose as needed [see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 5.1)].

	- **Hyperkalemia**: Kerendia can cause hyperkalemia [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)], and the risk increases with decreasing kidney function. It is greater in patients with higher baseline potassium levels or other risk factors for hyperkalemia. Measure serum potassium and eGFR in all patients before initiating treatment with Kerendia and adjust the dose accordingly [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. Do not initiate Kerendia if serum potassium exceeds 5.0 mEq/L.

	- Measure serum potassium periodically during treatment with Kerendia and adjust the dose as necessary [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. More frequent monitoring may be required for patients at risk for hyperkalemia, including those on concurrent medications that impair potassium excretion or increase serum potassium [see Drug Interactions (7.1, 7.2)].

### Retrospective review of the frequency of ECG changes in hyperkalemia [^115FYLdt]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2008). Low credibility.

Experimentally elevated potassium causes a clear pattern of electrocardiographic changes; however, clinically, the reliability of this pattern is unclear. Case reports suggest patients with renal insufficiency may have no electrocardiographic changes despite markedly elevated serum potassium. In a prospective series, 46% of patients with hyperkalemia were noted to have electrocardiographic changes, though no clear criteria were presented.

- **Design, setting, participants, and measurements**: Charts were reviewed for patients admitted to a community-based hospital with a diagnosis of hyperkalemia. Inclusion criteria were potassium levels ≥ 6 mmol/L with a corresponding electrocardiogram. Data were abstracted regarding comorbid diagnoses, medications, and treatment. Potassium concentrations were documented along with other electrolytes, pH, creatinine, and biomarkers of cardiac injury. Coincident, baseline, and follow-up electrocardiograms were examined for quantitative and qualitative changes in the QRS and T waves, as well as the official cardiology readings.

- **Results**: Ninety patients met the criteria; two-thirds were older than 65, and 48% presented with renal failure. Common medications included beta blockers, insulin, and aspirin; 80% of the patients had potassium levels < 7.2 mmol/L. The electrocardiogram was insensitive for diagnosing hyperkalemia. Quantitative assessments of T-wave amplitude corroborated subjective assessments of T-wave peaking; however, no diagnostic threshold could be established. The probability of electrocardiographic changes increased with increasing potassium levels.

### Clinical characteristics and electrophysiological mechanisms underlying Brugada ECG in patients with severe hyperkalemia [^116CvESG]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

Systemic hyperkalemia is most frequently found in patients with chronic and acute renal failure and/or concomitant treatments with nephrotoxic medications or K‐sparing drugs. The classical electrocardiographic manifestations of hyperkalemia were first documented in the early 1950s, characterized by peaked T waves, shortened QT interval, lengthening of the PR interval, loss of P waves, and widening of the QRS complex. Moreover, Levine et al. also described the presence of the "dialyzable" injury pattern resembling acute myocardial infarction or pericarditis. However, Littmann et al. reported the first consecutive series that recognized the similarities between the classic Brugada syndrome (BrS) ECG manifestations and those occasionally observed in the context of severe hyperkalemia.

In agreement with this and other studies, we found that Brugada phenocopy (BrPh) was most likely present in critically ill male patients with severe decompensation of their renal function and/or malignancies, exhibiting high mortality rates mostly associated with their underlying clinical condition. Additionally, we observed that, compared to hyperkalemic patients without Brugada ECG, BrPh patients presented with higher serum K+ values (on average, 1 mmol/L higher). Moreover, lower pH was strongly related to the development of BrPh. These findings, in conjunction with other outcome predictors such as younger age, lower hypertension prevalence, and lesser chronic renal disease, further confirm the importance of acute increments in K+ levels, which might be underestimated in this patient population.

### Clinical characteristics and electrophysiological mechanisms underlying Brugada ECG in patients with severe hyperkalemia [^113xxAcR]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

This report adds to our understanding of the electrocardiographic features of hyperkalemic BrPh patients. In patients with severe hyperkalemia attributed to critical medical conditions, a BrPh ECG is associated with a high prevalence of malignant arrhythmias and high all-cause mortality. BrPh ECG manifestations in patients with hyperkalemia are attributed to a depolarized resting membrane potential and reduced availability of inward sodium channels. Although I to elevation contributes, it is not essential to generate the hyperkalemic Brugada phenotype.

### Severe bradycardia from severe hyperkalemia: Patient characteristics, outcomes and factors associated with hemodynamic support [^113k3uAr]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Bradycardia is an under-studied manifestation of hyperkalemia potentially associated with adverse outcomes. We sought to systematically describe emergency department (ED) patients that present with severe bradycardia (heart rate < 50) associated with severe hyperkalemia (potassium ≥ 6.0 mEQ/L) and identify factors associated with the receipt of hemodynamic support.

- **Methods**: A retrospective, single-center, case series was performed at an urban, tertiary-care hospital from 1/1/2014 to 6/30/2020. We included consecutive adult ED patients presenting simultaneously with severe bradycardia and severe hyperkalemia. Patients with prehospital cardiac arrest, hemolyzed potassium specimens, or only point-of-care lab results were excluded. Detailed information, including chronic medications, electrocardiogram (ECG) features, and potassium/heart rate-directed treatments, was abstracted from the ED medical record. Intensive care utilization and in-hospital outcomes were also recorded. Factors associated with receipt of bradycardia-targeted treatment in the ED were determined with univariate comparisons.

- **Results**: We screened 319 records and included 87 patients [mean age 72.5 (95% CI 53–92), 55% female, median heart rate 43 (38–47) beats/min, mean potassium 7.1 (95% CI 5.6–8.7) mEQ/L]. Cardiovascular (hypertension 82%, congestive heart failure 28%) and renal (dialysis dependence 30%) comorbidities were common. Many patients were prescribed negative chronotropic agents (84%) or potassium-retaining (52%) chronic medications. Common presenting scenarios were missed hemodialysis.

### Real-world associations between renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibition therapy, hyperkalemia, and outcomes: A clinical and scientific call to action [^116iAquS]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

- **Background**: Recent studies have shown that the use of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors can lead to hyperkalemia, which may have significant clinical consequences. Despite the known benefits of RAAS inhibitors in managing cardiovascular diseases, the risk of hyperkalemia presents a challenge in their application.

- **Study design and participants**: The study involved a comprehensive analysis of real-world data from patients undergoing RAAS inhibitor therapy. The objective was to assess the incidence of hyperkalemia and its subsequent impact on health outcomes.

- **Findings**: The findings suggest a strong association between RAAS inhibitor use and the development of hyperkalemia. Patients experiencing hyperkalemia were observed to have worse clinical outcomes compared to those who did not develop this condition.

- **Call to action**: Given these findings, clinicians are encouraged to closely monitor potassium levels in patients on RAAS inhibitor therapy. Implementing strategies to mitigate the risk of hyperkalemia could improve patient outcomes significantly.

### Real world evidence for treatment of hyperkalemia in the emergency department (REVEAL-ED): A multicenter, prospective, observational study [^114cwdHY]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Contemporary emergency department (ED) standard-of-care treatment of hyperkalemia is poorly described. Our aim was to determine the treatment patterns of hyperkalemia management in the ED.

This multicenter, prospective, observational study evaluated patients aged ≥ 18 years with hyperkalemia (potassium [K⁺] level ≥ 5.5 mmol/L) in the ED from October 25, 2015, to March 30, 2016. K+-lowering therapies and K+ were documented at 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 hours after initial ED treatment. The primary endpoint was the change in K+ over 4 hours.

Overall, 203 patients were enrolled at 14 U.S.-based sites. The initial median K+ was 6.3 (interquartile range [IQR] 5.7–6.8) mmol/L, and the median time to treatment was 2.7 (IQR 1.9–3.5) hours post-ED arrival. Insulin/glucose (n = 130; 64%) was frequently used to treat hyperkalemia; overall, 43 different treatment combinations were employed within the first 4 hours. Within 4 hours, the median K+ for patients treated with medications alone decreased from 6.3 (IQR 5.8–6.8) mmol/L to 5.3 (4.8–5.7) mmol/L, while that for patients treated with dialysis decreased from 6.2 (IQR 6.0–6.6) mmol/L to 3.8 (IQR 3.6–4.2) mmol/L.

Hypoglycemia occurred in 6% of patients overall and in 17% of patients with K+ > 7.0 mmol/L. Hyperkalemia-related electrocardiogram changes were observed in 23% of all patients; 45% of patients with K+ > 7.0 mmol/L had peaked T waves or widened QRS. Overall, 79% were hospitalized; 3 patients died.

Hyperkalemia practice patterns vary considerably and, although treatment effectively lowered K+.

### Potassium disorders: Hypokalemia and hyperkalemia [^115KhjSU]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Hypokalemia and hyperkalemia are common electrolyte disorders caused by changes in potassium intake, altered excretion, or transcellular shifts. Diuretic use and gastrointestinal losses are common causes of hypokalemia, whereas kidney disease, hyperglycemia, and medication use are common causes of hyperkalemia. When severe, potassium disorders can lead to life-threatening cardiac conduction disturbances and neuromuscular dysfunction. Therefore, a first priority is determining the need for urgent treatment through a combination of history, physical examination, laboratory, and electrocardiography findings.

Indications for urgent treatment include severe or symptomatic hypokalemia or hyperkalemia; abrupt changes in potassium levels; electrocardiography changes; or the presence of certain comorbid conditions. Hypokalemia is treated with oral or intravenous potassium. To prevent cardiac conduction disturbances, intravenous calcium is administered to patients with hyperkalemic electrocardiography changes. Insulin, usually with concomitant glucose, and albuterol are preferred to lower serum potassium levels in the acute setting; sodium polystyrene sulfonate is reserved for subacute treatment. For both disorders, it is important to consider potential causes of transcellular shifts because patients are at increased risk of rebound potassium disturbances.

### Non-convulsive status epilepticus possibly induced by a rapid correction of severe hyperkalemia: A case report and literature review [^114GbVpP]. BMC Nephrology (2023). High credibility.

Patients with chronic kidney disease frequently develop neurological complications, including confusion and altered consciousness. Non-convulsive status epilepticus, characterized by a change in behavior and/or mental process accompanied by epileptiform discharges on an electroencephalogram in the absence of convulsive seizures, is one of the overlooked causes of altered consciousness. The incidence and precise pathophysiological mechanisms of non-convulsive status epilepticus in patients with kidney disease, especially those with electrolyte disturbances, remains unknown. We recently treated an older patient with chronic kidney disease and severe hyperkalemia, in whom non-convulsive status epilepticus developed following a correction of severe hyperkalemia.

- **Case presentation**: An 82-year-old male was admitted to our hospital at midnight because of weakness in all four limbs (Day 1). He underwent urgent hemodialysis for severe hyperkalemia (9.84 mEq/L), and his serum potassium concentration decreased to 4.97 mEq/L. He regained full consciousness, and his limb weakness improved on the morning of Day 2, but he became confused in the evening. Electroencephalogram revealed repeated low-voltage ictal discharges in the right occipital region, and a diagnosis of non-convulsive status epilepticus was made. Following medication with fosphenytoin and phenytoin, the patient became fully alert and oriented on Day 8.

- **Conclusion**: We speculate that a rapid correction of hyperkalemia was the possible cause of non-convulsive status epilepticus development.

### Hyperkalemia and the risks of adverse cardiovascular outcomes in patients with chronic kidney disease [^115gTidH]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). High credibility.

Proposed mechanisms linking hyperkalemia to cardiovascular disease in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have long been based on increased levels of aldosterone secretion due to higher serum potassium concentrations. The acutely elevated serum potassium levels associated with hyperkalemia can lead to kidney inflammation and fibrosis and have been associated with a higher risk of cardiac arrhythmia, caused by disruptions of myocardial action potentials that can interrupt typical heart rhythms. Although this underlying pathway may partially explain the observed outcomes, the majority of patients with hyperkalemia in the study had mild or moderate hyperkalemia at the index date. This suggests that hyperkalemia increases the risk of cardiovascular events through multiple mechanisms.

A prior study examining the impact of mild hyperkalemia compared with normokalemia on cardiovascular outcomes in patients with chronic heart failure in the United States and Canada between 1991 and 1993 found no association between mild hyperkalemia and cardiovascular-related hospitalization. However, the sample size was smaller and the follow-up duration was shorter relative to the present study, which may explain the difference between findings. Together, the overall evidence suggests that hyperkalemia is implicated as an important risk factor for cardiovascular disease in a population with CKD.

### Klor-Con [^114PqHxN]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2020). High credibility.

- **Symptoms**: The administration of oral potassium salts to individuals with normal excretory mechanisms for potassium rarely causes serious hyperkalemia. However, if excretory mechanisms are impaired, potentially fatal hyperkalemia can result [see Contraindications and Warnings]. It is important to recognize that hyperkalemia is usually asymptomatic and may be manifested only by an increased serum potassium concentration (6.5 mEq/L to 8.0 mEq/L) and characteristic electrocardiographic changes such as peaking of T-waves, loss of P-wave, depression of S-T segment, and prolongation of the QT interval. Late manifestations include muscle paralysis and cardiovascular collapse from cardiac arrest (9 to 12 mEq/L).

- **Treatment**: Treatment measures for hyperkalemia include the following:
	- Elimination of foods and medications containing potassium and of any agents with potassium-sparing properties.
	- Intravenous administration of 300 mL/hr to 500 mL/hr of 10% dextrose solution containing 10 to 20 units of crystalline insulin per 1,000 mL.
	- Correction of acidosis, if present, with intravenous sodium bicarbonate.
	- Use of exchange resins, hemodialysis, or peritoneal dialysis.

	- In treating hyperkalemia, it should be recalled that in patients stabilized on digitalis, too rapid a lowering of the serum potassium concentration can produce digitalis toxicity. The extended-release feature means that absorption and toxic effects may be delayed for hours. Consider standard measures to remove any unabsorbed drug.

### Clinical characteristics and electrophysiological mechanisms underlying Brugada ECG in patients with severe hyperkalemia [^114xDV6c]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

To differentiate between the mechanisms underlying Brugada phenotypes (BrPh) versus non-Brugada ECGs during hyperkalemia, we simulated the effects of increasing [K+]o in a human wedge model of the anterior ventricular walls, including the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT). Elevating the [K⁺]ₒ reduced the resting membrane potential from −87.9 ± 0.1 mV at [K⁺]ₒ = 5.4 mmol/L to −69.93 ± 0.08 mV at [K⁺]ₒ = 10.5 mmol/L, regardless of whether the RVOT was fibrotic. As expected, the depolarized resting potential reduced the availability of the sodium channels and slowed the conduction velocity (CV).

- **Simulation results**: Figure 3 A shows activation sequences and V1 to V3 recordings for four different [K⁺]ₒ levels (5.4, 7.5, 10.0, and 10.5 mmol/L) in the presence and absence of fibrosis at the RVOT. Conduction at the RVOT was significantly altered at 65% fibrosis, with changes in the activation sequence promoting the appearance of late and fractionated potentials on V1 to V3. There was a progressive slowing of conduction with increasing [K⁺]ₒ. At 5.4 mmol/L, CV at the RVOT in the absence of fibrosis was 97.89 cm/s versus 60.81 cm/s when fibrosis was included. In hyperkalemic conditions ([K⁺]ₒ = 10.0 mmol/L), CV was 57.53 cm/s at baseline versus 28.66 cm/s in the fibrotic RVOT.

- **Conduction and excitability**: Increasing [K⁺]ₒ to 10.5 mmol/L reduced CV to 47.22 cm/s at baseline but produced unexcitability and propagation failure in the fibrotic RVOT. A similar progression was also apparent on the V1, V2, and V3 recordings for each [K⁺]ₒ and normal/fibrotic state. Notable changes occurred on leads V1 and V2.

### Amiloride hydrochloride [^114CF1FC]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Warnings

- **Hyperkalemia**: The risk of hyperkalemia may be increased when potassium-conserving agents, including amiloride HCl, are administered concomitantly with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, an angiotensin II receptor antagonist, cyclosporine, or tacrolimus (see precautions, drug interactions). Warning signs or symptoms of hyperkalemia include paresthesias, muscular weakness, fatigue, flaccid paralysis of the extremities, bradycardia, shock, and ECG abnormalities. Monitoring of the serum potassium level is essential because mild hyperkalemia is not usually associated with an abnormal ECG.

	- When abnormal, the ECG in hyperkalemia is characterized primarily by tall, peaked T waves or elevations from previous tracings. There may also be lowering of the R wave and increased depth of the S wave, widening and even disappearance of the P wave, progressive widening of the QRS complex, prolongation of the PR interval, and ST depression.

- **Treatment of hyperkalemia**: If hyperkalemia occurs in patients taking amiloride HCl, the drug should be discontinued immediately. If the serum potassium level exceeds 6.5 mEq per liter, active measures should be taken to reduce it. Such measures include the intravenous administration of sodium bicarbonate solution or oral or parenteral glucose with a rapid-acting insulin preparation. If needed, a cation exchange resin such as sodium polystyrene sulfonate may be given orally or by enema. Patients with persistent hyperkalemia may require dialysis.

- **Diabetes mellitus**: In diabetic patients, hyperkalemia has been reported with the use of all

### Potassium chloride [^116TzZbo]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Overdosage**

- **Symptoms**: The administration of oral potassium salts to individuals with normal excretory mechanisms for potassium rarely causes serious hyperkalemia. However, if excretory mechanisms are impaired or potassium is administered too rapidly, potentially fatal hyperkalemia can result. Hyperkalemia is usually asymptomatic and may be indicated only by an increased serum potassium concentration (6.5–8.0 mEq/L) and characteristic electrocardiographic changes, such as the peaking of T-waves, loss of P-waves, depression of the S-T segment, and prolongation of the QT interval. Late manifestations include muscle paralysis and cardiovascular collapse from cardiac arrest (9–12 mEq/L).

- **Treatment**: Treatment measures for hyperkalemia include the following:
	- Monitor closely for arrhythmias and electrolyte changes.
	- Eliminate foods and medications containing potassium and any agents with potassium-sparing properties, such as potassium-sparing diuretics, ARBs, ACE inhibitors, NSAIDs, certain nutritional supplements, and many others.
	- Administer intravenous calcium gluconate if the patient is at no risk or low risk of developing digitalis toxicity.
	- Administer intravenously 300 to 500 mL/hr of a 10% dextrose solution containing 10 to 20 units of crystalline insulin per 1000 mL.
	- Correct acidosis, if present, with intravenous sodium bicarbonate.
	- Use exchange resins, hemodialysis, or peritoneal dialysis.

In patients who have been stabilized on digitalis, too rapid a lowering of the serum potassium concentration can produce digitalis toxicity.

### Potassium citrate extended release [^115T21t4]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Warnings and precautions:

- **Hyperkalemia**: In patients with impaired mechanisms for excreting potassium, potassium citrate administration can produce hyperkalemia and cardiac arrest. Potentially fatal hyperkalemia can develop rapidly and be asymptomatic. The use of potassium citrate in patients with chronic renal failure, or any other condition which impairs potassium excretion, such as severe myocardial damage or heart failure, should be avoided. Closely monitor for signs of hyperkalemia with periodic blood tests and ECGs.

- **Gastrointestinal lesions**: If there is severe vomiting, abdominal pain, or gastrointestinal bleeding, potassium citrate should be discontinued immediately and the possibility of bowel perforation or obstruction investigated.

Gastrointestinal lesions:

Solid dosage forms of potassium chlorides have produced stenotic and/or ulcerative lesions of the small bowel, leading to fatalities. These lesions are caused by a high local concentration of potassium ions where the tablets dissolve, injuring the bowel. Additionally, wax-matrix preparations, which are not enteric-coated, may release potassium in a manner that contributes to these effects.

### Electrocardiography is unreliable in detecting potentially lethal hyperkalaemia in haemodialysis patients [^1111maU9]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2002). Low credibility.

It is speculated, but unconfirmed, that the usual electrocardiographic manifestations of hyperkalaemia are less frequent and less pronounced in persons with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) than in those with normal renal function. We studied 74 consecutively selected stable haemodialysis patients to determine the prevalence of electrocardiographic changes of hyperkalaemia in stable persons with ESRD receiving haemodialysis.

- **Methods**: Pre-dialysis serum potassium concentration and other electrolytes were measured, and a simultaneous 12-lead electrocardiogram was obtained.

- **Results**: The 74 study subjects (45 men, 29 women) comprised 63 Blacks (85%), four Hispanics (6%), four Whites (6%), and three Asians (4%), with a mean ± standard deviation age of 55.5 ± 14.7 years. The mean pre-dialysis potassium concentration was 4.9 ± 0.71 mEq/l (range 3.3–6.7). No study subject exhibited arrhythmia or any of the typical electrocardiographic changes associated with hyperkalaemia. There was no significant difference in T wave amplitude (F statistic = 2.1; P = 0.11) or T wave to R wave ratio (F statistic = 2; P = 0.12) between quartiles of serum potassium concentration. Additionally, T wave amplitude was equivalent in patients with serum potassium concentration > 5.5 mEq/l (7.1 ± 4.1 mm) or ≤ 5.5 mEq/l (5.2 ± 3.5 mm) (P = 0.13). Linear regression analysis showed that the total serum calcium concentration had an inverse relation with T wave amplitude (P = 0.03) after adjustment for other factors; a high total serum calcium concentration was associated with a low T wave amplitude.

- **Conclusion**: Haemodialysis patients do not show the usual electrocardiographic manifestations of hyperkalaemia, questioning the reliability of electrocardiography for detecting hyperkalaemia in this population.

### Sudden cardiac death in a dialysis patient: Hyperkalemia reconsidered [^1124GviP]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

To many physicians, hyperkalemia is the first diagnosis ascribed to any patient with end-stage renal disease and abnormal electrocardiographic morphologies or dysrhythmias.

- **Case report**: A 52-year-old man with end-stage renal disease presented in cardiac arrest. The patient was initially presumed to have hyperkalemia, based on the appearance of wide QRS complexes on the monitor. However, the diagnosis of hyperkalemia was incorrect; the patient was severely hypokalemic and suffered episodes of ventricular fibrillation and torsades de pointes.

- **Why should an emergency physician be aware of this**: An emergency physician's differential diagnosis of sudden cardiac arrest in a patient with end-stage renal disease should not be limited to hyperkalemia and myocardial infarction. Hypokalemia should also be considered. Hypokalemia may be an under-recognized cause of sudden cardiac death in this patient population.

### Electrocardiographic manifestations of hyperkalemia [^116rNj3M]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2000). Low credibility.

Hyperkalemia is one of the more common acute life-threatening metabolic emergencies seen in the emergency department. Early diagnosis and empiric treatment of hyperkalemia depend in many cases on the emergency physician's ability to recognize the electrocardiographic manifestations of hyperkalemia. The electrocardiographic manifestations commonly include peaked T-waves, widening of the QRS-complex, and other abnormalities of altered cardiac conduction. Peaked T-waves in the precordial leads are among the most common and the most frequently recognized findings on the electrocardiogram. Other "classic" electrocardiographic findings in patients with hyperkalemia include the prolongation of the PR interval, flattening or absence of the P-wave, widening of the QRS complex, and a "sine-wave" appearance at severely elevated levels. A thorough knowledge of these findings is imperative for rapid diagnosis and treatment of hyperkalemia.
