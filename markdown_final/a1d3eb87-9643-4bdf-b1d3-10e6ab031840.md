## Question

how long to hold eliquis before dental surgery

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how long to hold Eliquis (apixaban) before dental surgery. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the dental procedure's inherent bleeding risk. Then, I should assess the patient's thromboembolic risk and renal function. Next, I will align recommendations with high-credibility guidance and the PAUSE protocol. After that, I need to translate this into specific hold and restart intervals, including CKD adjustments and urgent scenarios. Finally, I will integrate local hemostasis strategies, confirm that bridging is not needed, and summarize clear recommendations with caveats for special situations.

> Let me first confirm the procedure-related bleeding risk categories because this drives whether interruption is needed. Minimal-risk dental work like simple cleaning or a single filling generally does not require interruption of apixaban, whereas low-to-moderate risk procedures such as single tooth extraction or periodontal scaling often merit a short hold, and high-risk procedures like multiple or surgical extractions, implants, grafts, or periodontal surgery typically require a longer hold period to reduce bleeding, provided patient thrombotic risk allows it [^115RhMhM].

> I need to check patient-specific thromboembolic risk next, including the indication for apixaban (AF, VTE treatment or prevention), the CHA2DS2-VASc score for AF, the recency of VTE, and any history of mechanical heart valves or other very-high-risk states, while also confirming renal function and interacting medications that increase bleeding, such as NSAIDs or antiplatelets; note also that apixaban dosing for AF is reduced to 2.5 mg BID if at least two of age ≥ 80 years, weight ≤ 60 kg, or serum creatinine ≥ 1.5 mg/dL are present, which matters when thinking through perioperative levels and clearance [^113iMMcA] [^111UcWtA] [^113cX1Qc].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should verify evidence-based interruption intervals. The PAUSE framework for DOACs demonstrated low rates of thromboembolism and bleeding using a simple, standardized approach: hold apixaban 1 day before low-to-moderate risk procedures and 2 days before high-risk procedures, with corresponding 1-day and 2-day post-procedure resumptions once hemostasis is secured; this approach is echoed by a 2024 JAMA review of perioperative DOAC management, which applies well to dental care categories too [^113eyWC1] [^116nqRDb]. Wait, let me verify the FDA label while noting the rapid onset/offset features of DOACs highlighted in regulatory and review documents rather than explicit peri-dental timing guidance, so I should rely on clinical studies and consensus for scheduling decisions [^1125jo7v] [^116nqRDb].

> Now I will translate this into specific hold times, but I should double-check the role of renal function because delayed clearance can prolong anticoagulant effect. For minimal-risk dental procedures, continue apixaban without interruption, using local hemostasis as needed. For low-to-moderate risk dental procedures with CrCl > 50 mL/min, hold 1 day (skip two doses if BID) before the procedure. For high-risk dental procedures with CrCl > 50 mL/min, hold 2 days before. If CrCl is 30–50 mL/min, extend the preoperative hold by an additional 24 hours beyond the standard risk-based interval. If CrCl < 30 mL/min or advanced CKD/dialysis is present, interruption is often extended to about 3 or more days, with several series in advanced CKD reporting median holds near 84 hours irrespective of procedural risk; in this latter group, I should involve the proceduralist and anticoagulation specialist to individualize the plan [^116nqRDb] [^113eyWC1] [^116gK48s] [^113nMNqR] [^113iMMcA].

> But wait, what if the dental procedure is urgent and cannot be delayed to respect these intervals; I need to ensure we have a safety net. In emergencies, proceed with meticulous local hemostasis and consider specific reversal with andexanet alfa for apixaban in the setting of life-threatening bleeding or when rapid reversal is essential, balancing the thrombotic risks of reversal, while also remembering that adjunctive local measures like tranexamic acid mouthwash can significantly reduce oral bleeding during and after minor oral surgery or extractions [^112qyhe1] [^115RhMhM] [^115kkJ3S].

> Next, I should review the post-procedure strategy and confirm resumption timing. If hemostasis is secure, resume apixaban 24 hours after low-to-moderate risk procedures and 48 hours after high-risk procedures per PAUSE-style algorithms; bridging with heparin is not recommended for DOAC interruption because it increases bleeding without clear thromboembolic benefit, and the short half-life of DOACs obviates the need for bridging in most patients [^116nqRDb] [^115M98vi] [^115nZcRy] [^116Ywy1q].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost generalized "high thrombotic risk" to include mechanical heart valves; I should correct that because apixaban is not indicated for mechanical valves and such patients typically require VKA strategies, not DOACs. For genuinely high-thrombotic-risk DOAC indications like very recent VTE or very high CHA2DS2-VASc AF, I should minimize time off anticoagulation consistent with bleeding risk, continue for minimal-risk dental procedures, use the 1-day or 2-day holds for low-to-moderate or high-risk procedures respectively, and restart promptly when hemostasis allows, often at 12–24 hours for lower-risk oral procedures if bleeding is well controlled [^112CpLiu] [^115RhMhM] [^116nqRDb].

> I should double-check real-world adherence and pitfalls because practice variation can distort risk perceptions. Observational studies show frequent over-holding of DOACs and unnecessary bridging, leading to canceled or delayed procedures and potentially more bleeding complications, underscoring why standardized, evidence-based holds of 1–2 days aligned with procedure risk and renal function should be preferred [^117SKmt3] [^112TGDBj] [^1159SFvX].

> Let me consider whether laboratory confirmation of low residual anticoagulant effect helps in select high-risk scenarios. While not routinely required, measuring a DOAC-calibrated anti-factor Xa level and confirming a residual level below about 50 ng/mL can provide reassurance prior to high-bleeding-risk procedures or in complex renal impairment, particularly when precise timing is uncertain or when prior doses are unclear [^113cX1Qc].

> Pulling this together into actionable recommendations, I should confirm the dental procedure risk, renal function, and thromboembolic profile, then use a PAUSE-aligned plan: continue apixaban for minimal-risk dental procedures; hold 1 day before and resume 24 hours after low-to-moderate risk procedures if CrCl > 50 mL/min; hold 2 days before and resume 48 hours after high-risk procedures if CrCl > 50 mL/min; extend preoperative holds by an extra 24 hours if CrCl is 30–50 mL/min; consider 3 or more days in advanced CKD with individualized input; avoid heparin bridging; employ local hemostatic measures including tranexamic acid mouthwash; and in emergencies proceed with local control and consider andexanet alfa when rapid reversal is needed, always restarting as soon as hemostasis is secure to limit thrombotic risk [^113eyWC1] [^116nqRDb] [^115RhMhM] [^115kkJ3S] [^116gK48s] [^113nMNqR] [^115M98vi] [^112qyhe1].

Hold Eliquis (apixaban) for dental surgery based on bleeding risk and renal function [^116nqRDb] [^1145McAu]: **do not hold for low-risk procedures** (single extraction, scaling, fillings) — continue as usual with local hemostasis [^115RhMhM] [^115kkJ3S]. For high-risk procedures (multiple extractions, flap surgery, implants), **hold prior to the procedure based on renal function** — 24 hours if CrCl ≥ 50 mL/min, 48 hours if CrCl 30–49 mL/min, and 72 hours if CrCl < 30 mL/min. Resume Eliquis 24 hours after secure hemostasis; bridging is not needed [^116Ywy1q]. Individualize for high thrombotic risk or complex cases, and use local antifibrinolytics when appropriate [^115kkJ3S].

---

## Clinical considerations

### Bleeding risk assessment

Low-risk procedures include single tooth extraction, scaling, root planing, simple fillings, or restorative work [^115RhMhM], while **high-risk procedures** include multiple extractions, periodontal surgery, implant placement, or extensive oral surgery [^116nqRDb].

---

### Patient-specific factors

- **Renal function**: Apixaban is partially renally cleared; impaired renal function increases bleeding risk [^1145McAu] [^116gK48s].
- **Thromboembolic risk**: High-risk patients (e.g. mechanical heart valves, recent VTE) may need individualized plans [^1145McAu] [^116nqRDb].
- **Concomitant medications**: Antiplatelets, NSAIDs, and CYP3A4/P-gp inhibitors increase bleeding risk [^1145McAu] [^111UcWtA].

---

## Recommended timing for holding eliquis [^116nqRDb]

| **Procedure risk** | **Renal function (CrCl)** | **Recommended interruption** |
|-|-|-|
| Low-risk | Any | - Continue Eliquis <br/> - No interruption [^115RhMhM] |
| High-risk | ≥ 50 mL/min | Hold 24 hours before procedure |
| High-risk | 30–49 mL/min | Hold 48 hours before procedure |
| High-risk | < 30 mL/min | Hold 72 hours before procedure |

---

## Clinical evidence supporting recommendations

Evidence includes the **PAUSE study**, which found that standardized DOAC interruption based on bleeding risk and renal function resulted in low thromboembolism (0.2–0.4%) and major bleeding (1–2%) [^113cX1Qc] [^116nqRDb] [^1145McAu]. A **Cochrane review** showed that antifibrinolytics (e.g. tranexamic mouthwash) reduce bleeding in minor oral surgery, supporting continued anticoagulation in low-risk procedures [^115kkJ3S].

---

## Risks associated with interruption

Thromboembolic risk increases when Eliquis is stopped, especially in high-risk patients [^115DPxej] [^1145McAu], while **bleeding risk** increases when Eliquis is continued for high-risk procedures, though local measures can mitigate bleeding [^115RhMhM].

---

## Postoperative management

Postoperatively, **resume Eliquis** 24 hours after secure hemostasis; **bridging anticoagulation** is not required given its short half-life and rapid onset [^116Ywy1q] [^1145McAu].

---

## Special considerations

Patients at **high thromboembolic risk** require individualized plans and may warrant hematology consultation; **complex dental procedures** should be coordinated with the prescribing physician for tailored management [^115xsBwQ] [^1145McAu].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Low-risk procedures**: Continue Eliquis; no interruption [^115RhMhM].
- **High-risk procedures**: Hold Eliquis 24–72 hours before, based on renal function.
- **Postoperative**: Resume 24 hours after secure hemostasis [^116nqRDb].
- **No bridging**: Not required [^116Ywy1q].
- **Individualize**: For high thromboembolic risk or complex cases [^116WN6EW].

---

Eliquis interruption timing for dental surgery **depends on procedural bleeding risk and renal function**; follow the evidence-based intervals above and use local hemostatic measures to balance bleeding and thromboembolic risks [^116nqRDb] [^115kkJ3S].

### Management of antithrombotic therapy in patients undergoing dental procedures [^115RhMhM]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2025). High credibility.

A growing number of patients receiving antithrombotic therapy require dental procedures. Dental interventions in these patients can be challenging, as the risk of bleeding from the continuation of antithrombotic therapy needs to be weighed against the thromboembolic risk associated with drug interruption or de-escalation. Most minor dental procedures, including simple dental cleaning and filling, pose minimal bleeding risk, and antiplatelet or anticoagulation therapy can be continued without interruption. Local hemostatic measures, such as tranexamic mouthwash, can be used as needed to reduce bleeding events following these interventions.

- **Managing antithrombotic therapy during more invasive dental interventions and oral surgeries**: These procedures, associated with a higher risk of perioperative bleeding, necessitate the consideration of specific factors influencing bleeding risk and thromboembolism. In patients receiving antithrombotic therapy for primary prevention, temporary interruption is reasonable. In others, the decisions may be more complex and nuanced.

In this article, we review the evidence for managing patients receiving oral antiplatelet or anticoagulant drugs scheduled for various dental procedures and present a practical approach for the periprocedural management of antithrombotic treatments.

### Antifibrinolytic therapy for preventing oral bleeding in people on anticoagulants undergoing minor oral surgery or dental extractions [^115kkJ3S]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Individuals on continuous treatment with vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) or direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are at increased risk of bleeding complications during and after oral or dental procedures. Anticoagulant treatment is preferably continued at the same dose, since dose reduction or discontinuation of treatment is associated with an increased risk of thromboembolism. The use of haemostatic measures during or after the procedure (or both) could enable continuation of the oral anticoagulant treatment.

- **Objectives**: We aimed to assess the efficacy of antifibrinolytic agents for preventing bleeding complications in people on oral anticoagulants undergoing minor oral surgery or dental extractions.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Coagulopathies Trials Register, compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and conference abstract books. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews. We searched PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library. Additional searches were performed using ClinicalTrials.gov, the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP), the CINAHL database of nursing and allied health services, the open access ProQuest dissertation database, papers and reports from the American College of Clinical Pharmacy (ACCP), and abstract books from annual scientific conferences. Date of last search: 04 January 2018.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials in people on continuous treatment with VKAs or DOACs undergoing oral or dental procedures.

### Direct oral anticoagulant use: A practical guide to common clinical challenges [^1145McAu]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) — dabigatran (Pradaxa), rivaroxaban (Xarelto), apixaban (Eliquis), edoxaban (Savaysa), and betrixaban (Bevyxxa) — are pharmacotherapy agents used for the prevention of thrombosis in several cardiovascular contexts. DOACs are categorized into two main classes: oral direct factor Xa inhibitors (i.e. rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban, and betrixaban) and direct thrombin inhibitors (i.e. dabigatran).

In 2010, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved its first DOAC, dabigatran, followed by rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban, and betrixaban in the subsequent years. DOACs are relatively new agents demonstrating superiority or noninferiority to prior standards of care, such as anticoagulation with vitamin K antagonists (VKA; i.e. warfarin) or low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWHs), in reducing the risk of thromboembolic complications with similar or reduced bleeding risk.

- **Advantages of DOACs compared with VKAs**: Fewer monitoring requirements, less frequent follow-up, more immediate drug onset and offset effects (important for periprocedural and acute bleeding management), and fewer drug and food interactions. As a result, DOAC prescriptions exceeded those for warfarin by 2013, with apixaban being the most frequently prescribed DOAC for patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF).

Over the past decade, DOACs have been the subject of extensive investigation in many clinical scenarios. Although guidelines and review articles have provided detailed and in-depth analyses of the immense literature base, these can be too cumbersome for practical use in everyday clinical settings.

### Safety of anticoagulation interruption in patients undergoing surgery or invasive procedures: A systematic review and meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials and non-randomized studies [^115M98vi]. World Journal of Surgery (2017). High credibility.

The safety of anticoagulation interruption in patients requiring surgical or invasive procedures remains unclear. We thus performed a systematic review and meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and non-randomized studies (NRS).

- **Methods**: MEDLINE, Embase, and Central databases were searched up to March 2017 without date or language restrictions. We considered RCTs and NRS comparing anticoagulation interruption with any anticoagulation (continuation or heparin bridging) in adult surgical patients taking oral anticoagulation. Data were independently extracted. The quality of the evidence was assessed following recommendations from the Cochrane Collaboration (GRADE approach). Risk ratios were calculated for 30-day events: thromboembolic (TE) events, major bleeding, and mortality. Additional analyses explored the effects of different anticoagulation strategies.

- **Results**: Twelve reports were included: 4 RCTs (2,190 participants) and 8 NRS (18,993 participants). Trials included mostly participants with atrial fibrillation. Interrupting anticoagulation did not seem to increase TE events (RR 0.65, 95% CI [0.33, 1.30]) - 4 studies, 2,190 participants and resulted in less bleeding (RR 0.41, 95% CI [0.22, 0.78]) - 3 studies, 2,126 participants compared to anticoagulation continuation or heparin bridging. The GRADE assessment was moderate. Similar results were found in non-randomized studies, but the quality of the evidence was low. Possible strategy-specific effects were identified: forgoing heparin bridging seemed beneficial, but these effects were less clear with other strategies.

### The efficacy and safety of apixaban, an oral, direct factor Xa inhibitor, as thromboprophylaxis in patients following total knee replacement [^111csazE]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2007). Low credibility.

Heparins and warfarin are currently used as venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis in surgery. Inhibition of factor (F) Xa provides a specific mechanism of anticoagulation and the potential for an improved benefit-risk profile.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of apixaban, a potent, direct, oral inhibitor of FXa, in patients following total knee replacement (TKR) and to investigate dose-response relationships.

- **Patients/Methods**: A total of 1,238 patients were randomized to one of six double-blind apixaban doses [5, 10, or 20 mg day⁻¹ administered as a single (q.d.) or a twice-daily divided dose (b.i.d.)], enoxaparin (30 mg b.i.d.), or open-label warfarin (titrated to an International Normalized Ratio of 1.8–3.0). Treatment lasted 10–14 days, commencing 12–24 hours after surgery with apixaban or enoxaparin and on the evening of surgery with warfarin. The primary efficacy outcome was a composite of VTE (mandatory venography) and all-cause mortality during treatment. The primary safety outcome was major bleeding.

- **Results**: A total of 1,217 patients were eligible for safety and 856 patients for efficacy analysis. All apixaban groups had lower primary efficacy event rates than either comparator. The primary outcome rate decreased with increasing apixaban dose (P = 0.09 with q.d./b.i.d. regimens combined, P = 0.19 for q.d., and P = 0.13 for b.i.d. dosing). A significant dose-related increase in the incidence of total adjudicated bleeding events was noted in the q.d. (P = 0.01) and b.i.d. (P = 0.02) apixaban groups.

### SPL drug information for apixaban [^114ahYJB]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Regarding the use of apixaban PO (also known as Eliquis) in patients with peritoneal dialysis:

- **Use with caution**: The administration of apixaban in this patient population requires careful consideration.
- **Titrate with caution**: Dose adjustments should be approached carefully to ensure patient safety.

### Novel oral anticoagulants for the prevention of venous thromboembolism in surgical patients [^116z8N7Y]. Thrombosis Research (2013). Low credibility.

Pharmacologic prophylaxis with low-dose unfractionated heparin, low molecular weight heparin, or fondaparinux has clearly demonstrated a reduction in the rate of thromboembolic events in surgical patients. In the last decade, several novel oral anticoagulants have been tested in surgical patients, primarily in the context of major orthopedic surgery. Based on the results of these studies, dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban have been approved by the European Medicines Agency for the prevention of venous thromboembolism after elective hip or knee replacement surgery.

The novel anticoagulants represent an appealing alternative to prophylaxis strategies that are predominantly based on subcutaneous injection of low molecular weight heparin and have also been recommended by recently updated guidelines. Their role in other settings, such as hip fracture surgery or non-orthopedic surgery, may warrant future evaluation.

### Clinicians' adherence to guidelines for the preoperative management of direct oral anticoagulants in a tertiary hospital: a retrospective study [^112TGDBj]. BMC Anesthesiology (2023). Low credibility.

In-house recommendations adherence shows that only 116 patients (34.4%) followed our institution's anticoagulation management recommendations, which are primarily based on the ACCP guidelines. Among the 221 patients (65.6%) who did not adhere to this protocol, the majority of cases (n = 89, 26.4%) involved premature interruption of treatment, with direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) stopped before the recommended D-1 or D-2 days prior to surgery.

- **Premature interruption of treatment**: 89 patients (26.4%)
- **Heparin bridging despite non-recommendation**: 54 patients (16.0%)
- **No data available**: 28 cases (8.3%)
- **Late treatment interruption on D-1 instead of D-2**: 27 patients (8.0%)

Overall, 19 out of 54 patients (35.2%) who received heparin bridging experienced a thromboembolic event within three months previously. Additionally, 20 patients (5.9%) did not have their anticoagulant treatment interrupted at all, and only three patients (0.9%) underwent heparin bridging in accordance with our institutional recommendations when there was a thromboembolic event less than three months previously.

### Pradaxa [^113tB3sU]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Premature discontinuation of Pradaxa increases the risk of thrombotic events. Stopping any oral anticoagulant, including Pradaxa, prematurely can escalate the risk of such events. If anticoagulation with Pradaxa is discontinued for reasons other than pathological bleeding or the completion of a therapy course, consider transitioning the patient to another anticoagulant [see Dosage and Administration (2.5, 2.6, 2.7) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

- **Spinal/epidural hematoma**: Epidural or spinal hematomas may occur in patients treated with Pradaxa who are receiving neuraxial anesthesia or undergoing spinal puncture. These hematomas can result in long-term or permanent paralysis. Consider these risks when scheduling patients for spinal procedures. Factors that can increase the risk of developing epidural or spinal hematomas in these patients include:
	- Use of indwelling epidural catheters
	- Concomitant use of other drugs that affect hemostasis, such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), platelet inhibitors, other anticoagulants
	- A history of traumatic or repeated epidural or spinal punctures
	- A history of spinal deformity or spinal surgery

Optimal timing between the administration of Pradaxa and neuraxial procedures is not known [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. Monitor patients frequently for signs and symptoms of neurological impairment. If neurological compromise is noted, urgent treatment is necessary [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. Consider the benefits and risks before neuraxial intervention in patients who are anticoagulated or are to be anticoagulated.

### Direct oral anticoagulants: How do these drugs work, how to monitor, and what is their role in orthopaedic surgery [^115bHMvq]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2023). High credibility.

Postoperative venous thromboembolism is a major adverse event associated with orthopaedic surgery. With the addition of perioperative anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapy, the rates of symptomatic venous thromboembolism have dropped to 1% to 3%. Practicing orthopaedic surgeons must be familiar with these medications, including aspirin, heparin, warfarin, and the use of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs). DOACs are increasingly being prescribed due to their predictable pharmacokinetics and increased convenience, as they do not require routine monitoring, and currently, 1% to 2% of the general population is anticoagulated.

Although the introduction of DOACs has yielded additional treatment options, this has also led to confusion and uncertainty regarding treatment, specialized testing, and when and what reversal agents are appropriate. This article provides a basic overview of DOAC medications, their suggested use in the perioperative setting, effects on laboratory testing, and considerations for when and how to use reversal agents in orthopaedic patients.

### Clinicians' adherence to guidelines for the preoperative management of direct oral anticoagulants in a tertiary hospital: A retrospective study [^1159SFvX]. BMC Anesthesiology (2023). Low credibility.

In the recent ACCP guidelines, DOACs can be continued in cases of minimal bleeding risk or according to the clinician's judgment. However, only about 6% of the patients had not had their anticoagulant interrupted when a continuation was not recommended, suggesting a minimal influence on the final result.

These results contrasted with the 94% adherence observed in the PAUSE study. However, our study reflected a real-life setting that cannot be compared with the adherence to a study protocol. Premature interruption and heparin bridging, when not recommended, were responsible for more than half of the observed management failures by clinicians. Fear of bleeding or thromboembolic events could have driven this approach by clinicians despite data from the PAUSE study showing low rates of thromboembolic and hemorrhagic complications associated with this preoperative management of DOACs.

It is possible that clinicians still lack knowledge about our institutional recommendations, although they have been widely distributed as a pocket guide since 2015. Our findings could reflect a lack of confidence in these guidelines as some clinicians argue that the PAUSE study did not include enough patients with a high bleeding risk. Indeed, only a third of the patients it included underwent high-bleeding-risk surgery, with most being cardiac surgery. Clinicians could thus be less prone to following the ACCP guidelines when dealing with high-bleeding-risk surgeries; therefore, they increased the delay between the last DOAC dose and the surgery and/or the prescription of heparin bridging.

### Re-initiation of dabigatran and direct factor Xa antagonists following a major bleed [^11131XKx]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are a relatively recent addition to the oral anticoagulant armamentarium and provide an alternative to the use of vitamin K antagonists, such as warfarin. Regardless of the type of agent used, bleeding is the major complication of anticoagulant therapy. The decision to restart oral anticoagulation following a major hemorrhage in a previously anticoagulated patient is supported largely by retrospective studies rather than randomized clinical trials (mostly with vitamin K antagonists) and remains an issue of individualized clinical assessment. The patient's risk of thromboembolism must be balanced with the risk of re-major bleeding. This review provides guidance for clinicians regarding if and when a patient should be re-initiated on DOAC therapy following a major hemorrhage, based on the existing evidence.

### Bleeding risk scores in atrial fibrillation: Helpful or harmful [^111BUxbg]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Use of bleeding risk scores has been less valuable in patients receiving direct‐acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs). Recent studies have shown that DOACs reduce thromboembolic risk and bleeding risk, most importantly intracranial hemorrhage, in comparison to warfarin. These medications have fewer dietary effects and more predictable drug levels without frequent blood draws, providing improved ease of use for patients. Consequently, the prescription of DOACs is increasing, gradually supplanting warfarin use.

The study by Lip and colleagues, featured in this issue of JAHA, compares the HAS‐BLED and GARFIELD‐AF bleeding scores with warfarin‐treated patients. There is a paucity of evidence supporting the use of bleeding risk scores in patients on DOACs. Both the GARFIELD‐AF and ORBIT‐AF studies included very few patients on DOACs. Most bleeding risk scores were validated with warfarin.

In a large study of patients on DOACs in a Danish registry, the HAS‐BLED, ATRIA, and ORBIT‐AF scores were all moderately predictive, with a C index ranging from 0.58 to 0.61. The sensitivity and specificity of the HAS‐BLED score in this population were 62.8% and 53.5%, respectively. The positive predictive value of the HAS‐BLED score in this study was 3.0%, indicating that 100 patients would need to be "flagged" to predict 3 bleeds. Additionally, this study grouped major bleeding with clinically relevant minor bleeding.

Another study evaluated the use of DOACs with the bleeding risk score in a population of 39,539 Medicare Advantage patients.

### Perioperative management of antithrombotic therapy: Antithrombotic therapy and prevention of thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^116CzFgv]. Chest (2012). Low credibility.

This guideline addresses the management of patients who are receiving anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy and require elective surgery or a procedure. The methods herein follow those discussed in the methodology for the development of antithrombotic therapy and prevention of thrombosis guidelines, as outlined in the "Antithrombotic Therapy and Prevention of Thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines" article of this supplement.

- **Results**:
	- In patients requiring vitamin K antagonist (VKA) interruption before surgery, we recommend stopping VKAs 5 days before surgery instead of a shorter time before surgery (Grade 1B).
	- In patients with a mechanical heart valve, atrial fibrillation, or venous thromboembolism (VTE) at high risk for thromboembolism, we suggest bridging anticoagulation instead of no bridging during VKA interruption (Grade 2C). In patients at low risk, we suggest no bridging instead of bridging (Grade 2C).
	- In patients who require a dental procedure, we suggest continuing VKAs with an oral prohemostatic agent or stopping VKAs 2 to 3 days before the procedure instead of alternative strategies (Grade 2C).
	- In moderate- to high-risk patients who are receiving acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) and require noncardiac surgery, we suggest continuing ASA around the time of surgery instead of stopping ASA 7 to 10 days before surgery (Grade 2C).
	- In patients with a coronary stent who require surgery, we recommend deferring surgery more than 6 weeks after bare-metal stent placement and more than 6 months after drug-eluting stent placement instead of undertaking surgery sooner.

### Predictors of bleeding in the perioperative anticoagulant use for surgery evaluation study [^113cX1Qc]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). High credibility.

The primary clinical outcome of this PAUSE substudy was bleeding, defined as a composite of clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding (CRNM) and major bleeding (MB) or MB alone; all these events were adjudicated by an independent events adjudication committee blinded to the DOAC cohort and based on the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis criteria. The preoperative DOAC levels were assessed using DOAC-specific tests: a dilute thrombin time was used for patients receiving dabigatran, whereas rivaroxaban and apixaban concentrations were assessed using DOAC-calibrated anti-factor Xa levels. A cut point of 50 ng/mL was used to define a clinically acceptable low residual anticoagulant effect for a perioperative clinical setting.

Additional variables included as putative predictors of bleeding comprised age, sex, comorbidities, and medications. The clinical variables of the CHADS2 and CHA2DS2-VASc scores were included; the scores were prospectively collected but did not affect the DOAC management strategy. Furthermore, surgery-specific bleed risk, renal disease (defined as CrCl < 50 mL/min), prior history of major bleeding, and protocol interruption compliance were also considered potential predictors.

The selection of the potential predictors was guided by biological plausibility and prior data on perioperative bleeding. Determinants of arterial thromboembolism were not assessed because there were too few events (n = 10) to yield clinically meaningful analyses.

### Perioperative management of apixaban in patients with advanced CKD undergoing a planned invasive procedure [^116gK48s]. Blood Advances (2024). Low credibility.

The perioperative management of apixaban in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) involves careful consideration of kidney function and dialysis status. A study examined the interruption and resumption intervals of apixaban in patients undergoing invasive procedures, stratified according to procedural bleed risk.

- **Interval analysis**:
	- The interruption and resumption intervals were measured in hours, with intervals representing the time between the last dose of apixaban before the procedure and the procedure itself, approximated to the nearest 12 hours. Apixaban was not resumed after the procedure for one patient undergoing a low-bleed-risk procedure and four patients undergoing high-bleed-risk procedures.

- **Findings**:
	- For patients undergoing low/moderate-bleed-risk procedures, the median interruption was 84 hours (IQR 60–84), and the resumption interval was 24 hours (IQR 24–48). For high-bleed-risk procedures, the median interruption was 84 hours (IQR 60–84), and the resumption interval was 48 hours (IQR 24–72). While interruption intervals did not significantly differ according to procedural bleed risk (P = 0.38), patients who underwent high-bleed-risk procedures had significantly longer resumption intervals (P = 0.0037).

This study provides novel data on apixaban-treated patients with advanced CKD who underwent planned invasive procedures. Interruptions were over twice as long for patients undergoing low-bleed-risk procedures compared to those recommended in a recent perioperative DOAC management study (84 hours vs. approximately 39 hours in the PAUSE study) and were longer than guidelines recommended. This could be due to perceived delayed apixaban clearance in patients with kidney dysfunction. As expected, patients with CKD were at increasing risk for complications.

### Re-initiation of dabigatran and direct factor Xa antagonists following a major bleed [^1149hZjr]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

In summary, the decision to restart oral anticoagulant (OAC) therapy in a patient receiving chronic OAC who has suffered from a major bleed is a highly individualized assessment. The risk of thromboembolism must be balanced with the risk of major bleeding in that individual, while taking into account the morbidity and case-fatality of a thrombotic/bleed outcome, in addition to the optimal time frame of when to restart OAC.

It is also dependent upon the original indication for OAC and the type of major bleed from which the patient suffered. Many patients with OAC-associated intracerebral hemorrhages (ICHs) can restart OAC at some point between 1 and 30 weeks, but careful risk stratification must be performed. Most patients with OAC-associated clinically stable gastrointestinal (GI) hemorrhages can restart OAC at 1 week post-index bleed.

Currently, there are few data on how direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) might change the risk–benefit analysis of when to restart therapy following a major bleed event, particularly in ICH. However, the available data are reassuring, indicating that practitioners would expect approximately 50% fewer of these events versus vitamin K antagonist (VKA)-treated patients, which has significant implications from a public health perspective. A larger number of well-designed studies are needed in this area for both VKA and, especially, for DOAC-treated patient groups.

### Select drug-drug interactions with direct oral anticoagulants: JACC review topic of the week [^111UcWtA]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2020). High credibility.

Millions of individuals in the United States require long-term treatment with an oral anticoagulant. For decades, vitamin K antagonists were the only oral option available; however, they have a number of well-known limitations. The introduction of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) has long been considered a major therapeutic advance, largely because they eliminate the need for therapeutic monitoring. Despite this, DOACs, like vitamin K antagonists, can still cause major and clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding, even when used appropriately. Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) involving the DOACs represent an important contributor to increased bleeding risk. Awareness of these DDIs and how best to address them is of critical importance in optimizing management while mitigating bleeding risk. This review provides an overview of DOAC metabolism, the most common drugs likely to contribute to DOAC DDIs, their underlying mechanisms, and how best to address them.

### Pradaxa [^111uF5EK]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

If possible, discontinue PRADAXA Oral Pellets before invasive or surgical procedures because of the increased risk of bleeding. For pediatric patients, PRADAXA Oral Pellets should be stopped 24 hours before an elective surgery (eGFR > 80 mL/min/1.73 m²) or 2 days before an elective surgery (eGFR 50–80 mL/min/1.73 m²). Pediatric patients with an eGFR < 50 mL/min/1.73 m²have not been studied, so avoid the use of PRADAXA Oral Pellets in these patients.

- **Considerations for specific procedures**: Consider longer discontinuation times for patients undergoing major surgery, spinal puncture, or placement of a spinal or epidural catheter or port, in whom complete hemostasis may be required [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

If surgery cannot be delayed, there is an increased risk of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. This risk of bleeding should be weighed against the urgency of the intervention [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.3)]. In adults, a specific reversal agent (idarucizumab) is available in cases of emergency surgery or urgent procedures when reversal of the anticoagulant effect of dabigatran is needed. However, the efficacy and safety of idarucizumab have not been established in pediatric patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Refer to the idarucizumab prescribing information for additional details. Restart PRADAXA Oral Pellets as soon as medically appropriate.

### Peri-procedural management of patients taking oral anticoagulants [^116Ywy1q]. BMJ (2015). Low credibility.

Use of oral anticoagulants is becoming increasingly common. For many years, warfarin was the main oral anticoagulant available, but therapeutic options have expanded with the introduction of oral direct thrombin (dabigatran) and factor Xa inhibitors (apixaban, rivaroxaban, and edoxaban). Management of patients taking any oral anticoagulant in the peri-procedural period poses a challenge to medical and surgical providers because of the competing risks of thrombosis and hemorrhage.

- **Therapeutic options and management**: Bridging therapy has been used to minimize time without anticoagulation when warfarin is interrupted for invasive procedures, but validated strategies based on high-quality data are lacking. Existing data suggest that the use of bridging therapy may increase the risk of bleeding for some patients without reducing the risk of thrombosis. Clinical trials are currently underway to answer these questions. Because the half-lives and time to anticoagulant activity of newer oral anticoagulants are shorter than for warfarin, bridging therapy is not thought to be necessary with these agents.

- **Challenges in management**: Peri-procedural management of patients taking these agents is complicated by the lack of demonstrated reversal agents in emergency situations, although specific antidotes are being developed and tested. Existing guidelines for peri-procedural management of patients on oral anticoagulants highlight the importance of individualized patient decision-making and suggest strategies to minimize complications.

From a patient's perspective, given the uncertainties surrounding optimal management, explicit discussions regarding decisions are crucial.

### Timing the first postoperative dose of anticoagulants: Lessons learned from clinical trials [^112ZjWx5]. Chest (2015). Low credibility.

The non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs), such as rivaroxaban, apixaban, and dabigatran, have demonstrated effectiveness for thromboprophylaxis in patients undergoing elective hip or knee arthroplasty, as shown in phase 3 trials. Prior studies suggested that delaying the first postoperative dose for at least six hours after surgery improves the safety of anticoagulants in such patients.

In phase 2 studies, the timing of the first postoperative dose of NOACs varied: dabigatran was started 1 to 4 hours postoperatively, while rivaroxaban and apixaban were started at least 6 and 12 hours postoperatively, respectively.

- **Lessons from randomized trials**: Our review highlights three important lessons regarding thromboprophylaxis initiation:
	1. Clinical trials conducted before the evaluation of NOACs demonstrated that delaying the first dose of prophylactic anticoagulation until after major surgery is both effective and safe.
	2. The optimal timing for the first dose of prophylactic anticoagulation after surgery depends on the selected dose.
	3. Results from phase 3 trials with NOACs for thromboprophylaxis support that acceptable efficacy and safety can be achieved when the first postoperative anticoagulant dose is appropriately delayed by at least six hours post-surgery.

### Acute management of bleeding in patients on novel oral anticoagulants [^116XBArE]. European Heart Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Novel oral anticoagulants that directly inhibit thrombin (dabigatran) or factor Xa (rivaroxaban, apixaban) are currently available for the prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE) after orthopedic surgery, treatment of acute VTE, and the prevention of arterial thromboembolism in non-valvular atrial fibrillation. These agents offer several advantages over vitamin K antagonists (VKAs), including rapid onset, shorter half-lives, fewer drug interactions, and the absence of a need for routine monitoring. However, no established agents currently exist to reverse their anticoagulant effect.

We review the risk of bleeding with the novel oral anticoagulants and the limitations of conventional coagulation assays for measuring the anticoagulant effect. An approach is provided for managing patients with bleeding complications, supported by evidence for various interventions for reversal, where available.

### Apixaban in patients with atrial fibrillation [^112F87kz]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2011). High credibility.

The clinical calculator "Apixaban Dosage Calculator" is used for perioperative bleeding, perioperative cardiac risk management for noncardiac surgery, periprocedural management of antithrombotic therapy, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, cancer-associated thrombosis, acute ischemic stroke, portal vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis, and atrial fibrillation.

The Apixaban Dosage Calculator is a clinical tool to determine the appropriate dosage of apixaban, a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) used for thromboprophylaxis and treatment of thromboembolic conditions such as atrial fibrillation (AF), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and pulmonary embolism (PE). The dosage depends on three factors: age, weight, and renal function (creatinine clearance). The recommended dose in atrial fibrillation is 2.5 mg twice daily in patients with at least two of the following three characteristics: age ≥ 80 years, body weight ≤ 60 kg, or creatinine clearance ≤ 1.5 mg/dL.

The Apixaban Dosage Calculator determines the appropriate apixaban dosage based on specific patient information. This involves considering the patient's age, weight, creatinine clearance, and the reason for using apixaban. Here's how the process works:

- **Inputs**:
	- Age is captured in years, with a range of 18 to 120.
	- Weight can be entered either in kilograms (30 to 300 kg) or pounds (66 to 660 lb). If in pounds, it is converted to kilograms using a conversion rate (1 kg = 2.20462 lb).
	- Creatinine clearance is measured in mL/min, ranging from 0 to 150.
	- The indication for use includes four options: atrial fibrillation, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and prophylaxis for thromboembolism.

### Thromboembolic and bleeding risk of periprocedural bridging anticoagulation: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^115nZcRy]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Low credibility.

An estimated 2.5 million patients use oral anticoagulants for the prevention of arterial thromboembolic events in North America, and one‐tenth of them require temporary interruption in preparation for an elective procedure or surgery. However, the safety and efficacy of bridging anticoagulation is not completely clarified for patients who need an anticoagulation interruption before invasive procedures. Two main concerns remain unsolved: the risk of thromboembolism and the risk of bleeding.

To reduce the bleeding risk for patients undergoing invasive procedures, oral anticoagulants are typically interrupted prior to the procedure and then continued when hemostasis is achieved postprocedurally. Because the interruption of anticoagulation may expose patients to the risk of thromboembolism, heparin bridging (unfractionated heparin [UFH] or low‐molecular‐weight heparin [LMWH]) is administered to minimize the period of inadequate anticoagulation. It is of great importance to confirm whether bridging therapy reduces thromboembolic risk and to ascertain the safety of bridging therapy in relation to bleeding risk.

There have been many published articles related to bridging anticoagulation, but the quality of evidence and best practices is uneven across studies. Guidelines from the 2019 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association suggest using bridging anticoagulation in patients with a high thrombosis risk, such as those with certain mechanical valve prostheses or recent pulmonary embolism during interruption of vitamin K antagonists.

### A review of the perioperative management of direct oral anticoagulants for pediatric anesthesiologists [^115W5EW3]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2024). High credibility.

Although direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have been used in the adult population for over a decade, their use has begun to rise in pediatric populations since the FDA approval of rivaroxaban and dabigatran. DOACs offer several advantages for pediatric patients compared to other anticoagulants, including a similar safety profile, minimal lab monitoring, and ease of administration. The rise in DOAC use has led to an increasing number of pediatric patients managed on DOACs presenting for elective and urgent procedures. Perioperative management of anticoagulation is often challenging for providers due to the lack of expert consensus guidelines and the difficulty in balancing a patient's thrombotic risk with the bleeding risk for a given procedure.

This work presents a focused review for pediatric anesthesiologists on clinically available DOACs, perioperative monitoring and management of DOACs, as well as options and indications for reversal. Using the most current literature, this review aims to familiarize perioperative physicians with these agents, recommended uses, and potential perioperative management. While consensus expert practice guidelines are still needed, the information provided herein serves as a valuable resource until such guidelines are established.

### The bridging conundrum: Perioperative management of direct oral anticoagulants for venous thromboembolism [^1111NE6p]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2023). Low credibility.

Most patients diagnosed with venous thromboembolism (VTE) are currently treated with direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs). Before an invasive procedure or surgery, clinicians face the challenging decision of how to best manage DOACs. Should the DOAC be held, for how long, and are there instances where bridging with other anticoagulants should be considered? Although clinical trials indicate that most patients taking DOACs for atrial fibrillation do not require bridging anticoagulation, the optimal strategy for patients with a history of VTE is undefined. In this review, we present a case-based discussion for DOAC interruption perioperatively in patients receiving anticoagulation for the management of VTE.

### Clinicians' adherence to guidelines for the preoperative management of direct oral anticoagulants in a tertiary hospital: A retrospective study [^117SKmt3]. BMC Anesthesiology (2023). Low credibility.

Despite clear and relatively easy-to-use guidance, many clinicians find the preoperative management of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) challenging. Inappropriate management can delay procedures and lead to hemorrhagic or thromboembolic complications. This study aimed to describe preoperative management practices regarding DOACs in a tertiary hospital and clinicians' adherence to in-house recommendations.

- **Method**: We included all patients being treated with DOACs who underwent elective surgery in 2019 and 2020 (n = 337). In-house recommendations for perioperative management were largely comparable to the 2022 American College of Chest Physicians guidelines.

- **Results**: Typical patients were older adults with multiple comorbidities and high thrombotic risk stratification scores. Notably, 65.6% (n = 221) had not undergone recommended preoperative anticoagulation management protocols. Patients operated on using local anesthesia (adjusted OR = 0.30, 95%CI 0.14–0.66; p < 0.01) were less likely to have been treated following institutional recommendations. However, no association between their procedure's bleeding risk and adherence was found. Clinicians' failures to adhere to recommendations mostly involved late or non-indicated interruptions of anticoagulation treatment (n = 89, 26.4%) or inappropriate heparin bridging (n = 54, 16.0%). Forty-five (13.3%) procedures had to be postponed. Incorrect preoperative anticoagulation management was directly responsible for 12 out of 45 postponements (26.7% of postponements).

This study highlights clinicians' low adherence rates to institutional recommendations.

### Perioperative management of vitamin K antagonists and direct oral anticoagulants: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^115xsBwQ]. Chest (2023). High credibility.

The management of patients who are receiving chronic oral anticoagulation therapy and require elective surgery or an invasive procedure is a common clinical scenario.

- **Research question**: What is the best available evidence to support the development of American College of Chest Physicians guidelines on the perioperative management of patients who are receiving long-term vitamin K agonist (VKA) or direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) and require elective surgery or procedures?

- **Study design and methods**: A literature search, including multiple databases from database inception through July 16, 2020, was performed. Meta-analyses were conducted when appropriate.

- **Results**: In patients receiving VKA (warfarin) undergoing elective noncardiac surgery, shorter (< 3 days) VKA interruption is associated with an increased risk of major bleeding. In patients who required VKA interruption, heparin bridging (mostly with low-molecular-weight heparin [LMWH]) was associated with a statistically significant increased risk of major bleed, representing a very low certainty of evidence (COE). Compared with DOAC interruption 1 to 4 days before surgery, continuing DOACs may be associated with a higher risk of bleeding demonstrated in some, but not all studies. In patients who needed DOAC interruption, bridging with LMWH may be associated with a statistically significant increased risk of bleeding, representing a low COE.

- **Interpretation**: The certainty in the evidence supporting the perioperative management of anticoagulants remains limited. No high-quality evidence exists to support the practice decisively.

Boxed warnings regarding the use of apixaban PO (also known as Eliquis):

- **Epidural hematoma, spinal hematoma**: Do not use in patients undergoing neuraxial anesthesia or spinal puncture. Delay the administration of apixaban for 48 hours if a traumatic epidural or spinal puncture occurs. Do not remove indwelling epidural or intrathecal catheters 5 hours after the removal of the catheter.

- **Thrombosis**: Maintain a high level of suspicion in patients discontinuing apixaban prematurely.

### What surgeons should know about non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants: A review [^112CpLiu]. JAMA Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants (NOACs) are increasingly prescribed for patients to treat or prevent arterial or venous thromboembolism. The following four NOAC agents are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for clinical use: dabigatran etexilate, apixaban, edoxaban tosylate, and rivaroxaban. A good understanding of these agents' pharmacologic properties is important for surgeons given their marked differences compared with warfarin sodium. This review highlights key practical issues surrounding the use of NOACs in the perioperative setting.

The PubMed and Cochrane Library databases were searched for English-language studies from May 1, 2009, until May 1, 2017, for randomized clinical trials, meta-analyses, systematic reviews, observational studies, and clinical guidelines. From a systematic review of the published literature that included 70 articles and 166,404 patients, this study identified five key practical issues surrounding the use of NOACs in the perioperative setting. These include patient populations for which NOAC use is indicated and contraindicated, the timing of NOAC treatment cessation before invasive interventions, management of NOAC-treated patients requiring urgent interventions, the need for "bridging", and the timing of NOAC treatment's reinitiation after invasive interventions. Important findings are as follows: NOAC agents are not recommended for patients with mechanical heart valves or advanced kidney disease (creatinine clearance, < 15 mL/min). Minimal to no anticoagulant effect remains when therapy with a NOAC is w

### Clinicians' adherence to guidelines for the preoperative management of direct oral anticoagulants in a tertiary hospital: a retrospective study [^115U7dSj]. BMC Anesthesiology (2023). High credibility.

We conducted a retrospective study based on a cohort of patients treated using direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) who underwent elective surgery during 2019 and 2020. The data collection was approved by the cantonal research ethics commission (CCER 2021–00639). Study inclusion criteria included patients being 18 years or older, undergoing anticoagulation therapy with any DOAC (i.e. rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban, or dabigatran), and being scheduled for elective surgery. Exclusion criteria included the absence of information on the date of surgery, flutter ablations, cardioversions, and contraindications to surgery detected at the anaesthesia consultation.

Data were extracted from patients' electronic medical files, mostly during anaesthesia consultations. This included patient characteristics such as age, sex, body mass index, and CHA₂DS₂ and/or CHA₂DS₂-VASc risk stratification scores for patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). We also collected information on comorbidities (e.g. heart failure, hypertension, diabetes, stroke, transient ischaemic attack, coronary artery disease, lower-limb artery disease, a prosthetic valve, mitral regurgitation, thromboembolic venous disease, active cancer), laboratory values (e.g. haemoglobin, platelets, serum creatinine, creatinine clearance), type of DOAC and dosing, and the surgical bleeding risk as defined by the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) Guidance Statement. The type of anaesthesia (general, neuraxial, local, or other) and intervention postponements along with their causes were also documented.

### Periprocedural management of patients receiving a vitamin K antagonist or a direct oral anticoagulant requiring an elective procedure or surgery [^116WN6EW]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2016). Low credibility.

The periprocedural management of patients receiving chronic therapy with oral anticoagulants (OACs), including vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) such as warfarin and direct OACs (DOACs), is a common clinical problem. The optimal perioperative management of patients receiving chronic OAC therapy is anchored on four key principles:

- **Risk stratification**: Patient-related and procedure-related risks of thrombosis and bleeding.
- **Clinical consequences**: The potential outcomes of a thrombotic or bleeding event.
- **Discontinuation and reinitiation**: Based on the pharmacokinetic properties of each agent.
- **Aggressive management consideration**: Evaluating whether using periprocedural heparin bridging is advantageous for preventing postoperative thromboembolism, despite a possible increased bleeding risk.

Recent data from randomized trials in patients receiving VKAs, who are undergoing pacemaker/defibrillator implantation or using heparin bridging therapy for elective procedures or surgeries, can now inform best practice. Additionally, there are emerging data on periprocedural outcomes in DOAC trials for patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation. This review summarizes the evidence for the periprocedural management of patients receiving chronic OAC therapy. It focuses on recent randomized trials and large outcome studies to address three key clinical scenarios:

1. Can OAC therapy be safely continued for minor procedures or surgeries?
2. If therapy with VKAs (especially warfarin) needs to be temporarily interrupted for an elective procedure or surgery, is heparin bridging necessary?

### Effective apixaban removal using hemoadsorption during emergent open-heart surgery: A case report and narrative literature review [^116KKFsk]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2024). High credibility.

The management of hemostasis in patients medicated with apixaban (Eliquis) undergoing emergency cardiac surgery is exceedingly difficult. The body's natural elimination pathways for apixaban prove ineffective in emergency situations, and the impact of hemodialysis is limited. The application of Cytosorb® may attenuate the concentration of apixaban, thereby facilitating the stabilization of these patients.

- **Case presentation**: An 84-year-old man treated with apixaban underwent emergency ascending aorta replacement surgery due to an acute type A aortic dissection. To address the challenges induced by apixaban, we integrated a Cytosorb® cartridge into the cardiopulmonary bypass circuit. There was a 63.7% decrease in perioperative apixaban-specific anti-factor Xa activity. The patient's postoperative course was favorable.

- **Conclusion**: Hemoadsorption with Cytosorb® may offer a safe and feasible approach for reducing apixaban concentration in emergency cardiac surgery, thereby mitigating the risk of hemorrhagic complications.

### Practical aspects of the oral new anticoagulants [^111bSqFZ]. American Journal of Hematology (2011). Low credibility.

After years of only oral vitamin K antagonists, many new antithrombotic agents are in development and are entering the marketplace. This review will analyze clinical trial results for these new agents, especially dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban. Also to be discussed are practical aspects of using these new agents, such as monitoring, reversal, and use before procedures.

### Clinicians' adherence to guidelines for the preoperative management of direct oral anticoagulants in a tertiary hospital: a retrospective study [^113eyWC1]. BMC Anesthesiology (2023). High credibility.

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have become the medication of choice for the treatment and prophylaxis of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), as well as for reducing the risk of stroke and systemic embolism in non-valvular atrial fibrillation (AF). However, patients treated with DOACs often face increased bleeding risks due to factors such as advanced age, polymorbidity, or polymedication. Their anticoagulant therapies are frequently interrupted for surgical or non-surgical procedures. Each year, one in six patients with AF — an estimated six million patients worldwide — require perioperative anticoagulant management. Appropriate management of this interruption is critical to avoiding periprocedural bleeding or ischemic events.

Correctly timing interruptions is essential and can affect the organization and planning of procedures for both physicians and patients. Several guidelines validated by the Perioperative Anticoagulation Use for Surgery Evaluation (PAUSE) study suggest managing the interruption of preoperative anticoagulation based on renal function and surgery bleeding risk. The PAUSE protocol recommends that the interruption of anticoagulation therapy should occur one to two days before surgery for patients taking rivaroxaban and apixaban, depending on their risk of bleeding, and one to four days before surgery for patients taking dabigatran, depending on their renal function. The rates of thromboembolic and hemorrhagic complications reported in the PAUSE study were low, with major bleeding observed.

### Perioperative management of apixaban in patients with advanced CKD undergoing a planned invasive procedure [^113nMNqR]. Blood Advances (2024). Low credibility.

Patients in this study had significant renal dysfunction, with CrCl values well below those described in the PAUSE study. Most patients were receiving reduced-dose apixaban despite only two-thirds meeting criteria for dose reduction. Perioperative consultants often recommended apixaban dose reduction or rotation to a different anticoagulant. Preoperative interruption intervals in this study were similar for low- and high-bleed-risk procedures. Taken together, these findings suggest physicians were apprehensive about perioperative apixaban use in patients with advanced CKD and placed greater emphasis on kidney dysfunction than procedural bleed risk when deciding on an interruption interval.

- **Limitations of this study**: Include its retrospective design with resulting potential for information bias, as well as a small sample size which leads to wide CIs and uncertainty surrounding risk estimates. Little information was available on residual apixaban levels, as few patients had a level drawn. Nonetheless, our findings provide preliminary but important data on apixaban-treated patients with advanced CKD undergoing invasive procedures.

### Peri-procedural management of oral anticoagulants in the DOAC era [^1145H6eJ]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Peri-procedural management of oral anticoagulants can be complex and confusing for many providers. It involves a careful balance of a patient's thromboembolic risk and bleeding risk. For every patient chronically taking an oral anticoagulant who will be undergoing an elective procedure, a four-step approach may be considered when creating a plan for the oral anticoagulant:

- **Determining need to stop anticoagulant**: Does the oral anticoagulant need to be stopped for the procedure?
- **Timing for stopping anticoagulant**: If yes, when should the oral anticoagulant be stopped pre-procedure?
- **Bridging anticoagulation**: Does the patient require a "bridging" parenteral anticoagulant?
- **Resuming anticoagulation**: When should anticoagulation be re-started post-procedure?

Based on the unique features of warfarin versus the direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC), a unique, personalized plan should be developed and tailored to the individual patient. Anticoagulant specialists, such as anticoagulation clinic pharmacists, may help facilitate this process.

### Efficacy and safety of the oral direct factor Xa inhibitor apixaban for symptomatic deep vein thrombosis. The Botticelli DVT dose-ranging study [^113KaUjN]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2008). Low credibility.

Apixaban, an oral potent reversible direct inhibitor of activated factor X, has shown promise in the prevention of venous thromboembolism following major orthopedic surgery. We conducted a dose-ranging study in patients with deep vein thrombosis.

- **Methods**: Consecutive patients with symptomatic deep vein thrombosis were included and randomized to receive 84–91 days of apixaban 5 mg twice-daily, 10 mg twice-daily, or 20 mg once-daily, or low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) followed by a vitamin K antagonist (VKA). The primary efficacy outcome was the composite of symptomatic recurrent venous thromboembolism and asymptomatic deterioration of bilateral compression ultrasound or perfusion lung scan. The principal safety outcome was the composite of major and clinically relevant, non-major bleeding.

- **Results**: The mean age of the 520 included patients was 59 years, and 62% were male. The primary outcome occurred in 17 of the 358 apixaban-treated patients (4.7%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.8–7.5%) and in five of the 118 LMWH/VKA-treated patients (4.2%, 95% CI 1.4–9.6%) who were evaluable. The incidence in all three apixaban groups was low and comparable without evidence of a dose response. The principal safety outcome occurred in 28 (7.3%) of the 385 apixaban-treated patients and in 10 (7.9%) of the 126 LMWH/VKA-treated patients. No dose response for apixaban was observed.

- **Conclusion**: These observations warrant further evaluation of apixaban in phase III studies. The attractive fixed-dose regimen of this compound may meet the demand to simplify anticoagulant treatment.

### How I treat anticoagulated patients undergoing an elective procedure or surgery [^1118PP1p]. Blood (2012). Low credibility.

The periprocedural management of patients receiving long-term oral anticoagulant therapy remains a common but difficult clinical problem, with a lack of high-quality evidence to inform best practices. It is a patient's thromboembolic risk that drives the need for an aggressive periprocedural strategy, including the use of heparin bridging therapy to minimize time off anticoagulant therapy, while the procedural bleed risk determines how and when postprocedural anticoagulant therapy should be resumed. Warfarin should be continued in patients undergoing selected minor procedures, whereas in major procedures that necessitate warfarin interruption, heparin bridging therapy should be considered in patients at high thromboembolic risk and in a minority of patients at moderate risk. Periprocedural data with the novel oral anticoagulants, such as dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban, are emerging. However, their relatively short half-life, rapid onset of action, and predictable pharmacokinetics should simplify periprocedural use. This review aims to provide a practical, clinician-focused approach to periprocedural anticoagulant management.

### Perioperative management of patients on chronic antithrombotic therapy [^111Ca7gi]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology Education Program (2012). Low credibility.

Perioperative management of antithrombotic therapy frequently occurs and requires consideration of the patient, the procedure, and an expanding array of anticoagulant and antiplatelet agents. Preoperative assessment must address each patient's risk for thromboembolic events balanced against the risk for perioperative bleeding. Procedures can be categorized into those with a low bleeding risk, which generally do not require complete reversal of the antithrombotic therapy, and those associated with an intermediate or high bleeding risk.

For patients receiving warfarin who need interruption of the anticoagulant, it is important to consider whether simply withholding the anticoagulant is optimal or whether a perioperative "bridge" with an alternative agent, typically a low-molecular-weight heparin, should be used. The new oral anticoagulants dabigatran and rivaroxaban have shorter effective half-lives; however, they present other concerns for perioperative management, including prolonged drug effect in patients with renal insufficiency, limited experience with clinical laboratory testing to confirm the lack of residual anticoagulant effect, and lack of a reversal agent.

Antiplatelet agents must also be considered in the perioperative setting, with particular attention given to the potential risk for thrombotic complications in patients with coronary artery stents who have antiplatelet therapy withheld.

### Re-initiation of dabigatran and direct factor Xa antagonists following a major bleed [^1156PqbL]. The American Journal of Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

There are multiple definitions for assessing the severity of bleeding episodes. Major hemorrhage is defined by the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis as fatal bleeding, symptomatic bleeding in a critical area or organ, or bleeding causing a fall in hemoglobin level of 20 g/L (1.24 mmol/L or 2 g/dL) or more, or leading to the transfusion of ≥ 2 units of whole blood or red cells. Consequently, patients enrolled in studies of OAC-associated International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis-defined major bleeding consist of a heterogeneous population arising from different clinical specialties, which compounds the difficulties of studying these scenarios.

Estimates of the risk of major hemorrhage related to OAC range from 2% to 3% in clinical trials to approximately 1% to 7% in population cohort studies. The exact incidence of major hemorrhage is unknown due to uncertainties regarding the intensity of OAC therapy and patient-related factors such as history of bleeding, concomitant disease, alcohol use, age, and risk of falls.

Regarding types of major hemorrhage related to OAC, the largest amount of published data is for ICH and GI bleeding, and this review will focus on these two clinical entities. Recommendations for restarting OAC therapy in other major bleeding situations, which are relatively rare, will remain as risk–benefit decisions for the individual clinician and patient.

### Management of surgical patients receiving anticoagulation and antiplatelet agents [^113k8yRZ]. The British Journal of Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Temporary interruption of long-term anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapy during surgical procedures exposes patients to thrombotic risk. However, continuation of these agents is associated with an increased risk of bleeding. Managing anticoagulation can be particularly challenging in an emergency setting.

- **Literature review**: A literature review of published articles was conducted using the keywords heparin, warfarin, perioperative, antiplatelet, aspirin, and surgery. A management plan for all likely situations was developed.

- **Results and conclusion**: Based on an individual assessment of risk factors for arterial or venous thromboembolism and the risk of perioperative bleeding, it is possible to form an anticoagulant and antiplatelet management plan likely to achieve a low incidence of bleeding and thrombosis. A multidisciplinary approach is desirable.

### Do we have to stop anticoagulant and platelet-inhibitor treatments during proctological surgery [^114i1j33]. Colorectal Disease (2012). Low credibility.

This prospective observational study evaluated the incidence of secondary bleeding after proctological surgery without interruption of oral anticoagulant or platelet-inhibitor treatments.

The number of episodes of postoperative bleeding was identified prospectively from the day of surgery to the last follow-up visit in consecutive patients operated on during 2010 in two units dedicated to proctology.

A total of 2,513 procedures were performed in 2,314 patients (1,379 men), aged 46 ± 16 years. Secondary bleeding occurred after 115 (4.6%) procedures, no later than day 24 after surgery, requiring rehospitalization in 86% of cases and further surgery and/or transfusion in 36%. The highest frequency was noted after surgery for haemorrhoids: haemorrhoidopexy (7.9%), haemorrhoidectomy (6.2%) (P = NS), and transanal excision of rectal tumours (6.5%). On multivariate analysis, the frequency was significantly increased by clopidogrel (15%) [relative risk (RR) = 10]. In patients on oral anticoagulants, bleeding occurred in 23% (RR = 5.8) if the anticoagulants were not interrupted and in 57% (RR = 42) if the anticoagulants were discontinued and replaced with heparin.

During proctological surgery, the overall risk of postoperative bleeding is low, but it can occur up to 3 weeks after surgery and is often severe. Maintenance treatment with oral anticoagulants is the most important risk factor, aggravated by a change to heparin. Clopidogrel also significantly increases the bleeding risk.

### Comparison of temporary interruption with continuation of direct oral anticoagulants for low bleeding risk procedures [^115oC3SQ]. Thrombosis Research (2021). Low credibility.

Limited data is available on the rates of bleeding and thromboembolic events for patients undergoing low bleeding risk procedures while taking direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC).

- **Methods**: Adults taking DOAC in the Michigan Anticoagulation Quality Improvement Initiative (MAQI 2) database who underwent a low bleeding risk procedure between May 2015 and Sep 2019 were included. Thirty-day bleeding (of any severity), thromboembolic events, and death were compared between DOAC temporarily interrupted and continued uninterrupted groups. Adverse event rates were compared using an inverse probability weighting propensity score.

- **Results**: There were 820 patients who underwent 1412 low-risk procedures. DOAC therapy was temporarily interrupted in 371 (45.2%) patients (601 [42.6%] procedures) and continued uninterrupted in 449 (54.8%) patients (811 [57.4%] procedures). DOAC patients with temporary interruptions were more likely to have diabetes, prior stroke or TIA, prior bleeding, higher CHA2DS2-VASc, and higher modified HAS-BLED scores. DOAC interruption was common for gastrointestinal endoscopy, electrophysiology device implantation, and cardiac catheterization, while it was less common for cardioversion, dermatologic procedures, and subcutaneous injection. After propensity score adjustment, bleeding risk was lower in the DOAC temporary interruption group (OR 0.62, 95% CI 0.41–0.95) compared to the group with continuous DOAC use. Rates of thromboembolic events and death did not differ significantly between the two groups.

- **Conclusions**: DOAC-treated patients undergoing fewer bleeding events when therapy is temporarily interrupted for low bleeding risk procedures, while the rates of thromboembolic events and death remain similar between those who interrupt and those who continue DOAC therapy.

### Thrombotic complications with interruption of direct oral anticoagulants in dermatologic surgery [^113QBKTz]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2021). Low credibility.

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), such as apixaban, rivaroxaban, and dabigatran, are increasingly being used to provide prophylaxis and treatment for arterial and venous thromboembolism. Multiple procedural subspecialties have implemented guidelines detailing time frames for perioperative DOAC interruption; however, the impact of perioperative DOAC interruption in patients undergoing dermatologic surgery is currently unknown, and evidence-based guidelines are lacking.

- **Objective**: To assess the 30-day postoperative rate of thrombotic complications (ischemic stroke, transient ischemic attack, systemic embolism, deep vein thrombosis [DVT], and pulmonary embolism) in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (AF) or a history of DVT who underwent perioperative DOAC interruption during dermatologic surgery.

- **Methods**: A retrospective medical record review was performed of all patients with AF or a history of DVT who underwent perioperative DOAC interruption during dermatologic surgery at Advanced Dermatologic Surgery and the University of Kansas Medical Center between January 1, 2016, and August 31, 2020.

- **Results**: Among 806 operations, comprising 750 Mohs micrographic operations (93.1%) and 56 excisions (6.9%), 1 patient (0.14% of patients with AF) sustained a transient ischemic attack and 2 patients (0.25% of all patients) sustained minor bleeding complications during the 30-day postoperative period.

- **Conclusion**: Perioperative DOAC interruption appears to be safe and efficacious in dermatologic surgery.

### The 2023 WSES guidelines on the management of trauma in elderly and frail patients [^112qyhe1]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2024). Low credibility.

Andexanet alpha (Andexxa®) is a modified human recombinant factor Xa decoy protein that lacks catalytic activity. It serves as a specific urgent reversal agent for rivaroxaban and apixaban by binding with high affinity to direct Xa inhibitors and indirect Factor Xa inhibitors, such as low-molecular-weight heparin and fondaparinux.

The dosing of andexanet alfa depends on the direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) and the timing since the last intake. For rivaroxaban (when the last intake was more than 7 hours before reversal) or apixaban, a 400 mg bolus is administered followed by a 480 mg infusion (4 mg/min). For rivaroxaban (when the last intake was less than 7 hours before reversal or unknown recent intake), edoxaban, or enoxaparin, an 800 mg bolus followed by a 960 mg infusion (8 mg/min) is given.

The ANNEXA-4 (Prospective, Open-Label Study of Andexanet Alfa in Patients Receiving a Factor Xa Inhibitor Who Have Acute Major Bleeding) study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of andexanet alfa reversal in patients presenting with major bleeding within 18 hours after taking FXa inhibitors (apixaban, rivaroxaban, edoxaban). Three hundred fifty-two patients were enrolled and treated with andexanet alfa administered as an intravenous bolus, followed by a 2-hour infusion, according to the type of FXa inhibitor and timing of the last FXa inhibitor dose. At the end of the andexanet bolus, anti-FXa activity was reduced from baseline by 92% (95% CI 91–93) in apixaban-treated patients and by 92% (95% CI 88–94) in rivaroxaban-treated patients. This effect persisted for the duration of the infusion, followed by a subsequent increase in anti-FXa activity.

### Association of atrial fibrillation and oral anticoagulant use with perioperative outcomes after major noncardiac surgery [^113j4L8D]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Presently, expert consensus guidelines recommend that DOAC agents be withheld for 24 to 48 hours before performing invasive procedures. Notably, these recommendations are based on the largely predictable (but not readily measurable) pharmacokinetic profile of DOAC agents. At the time of writing, however, there are no published randomized trial data on the optimal timing of DOAC cessation before invasive procedures or surgeries. Although stopping DOACs for patients 24 to 48 hours before elective surgery is logistically feasible, it is likely much more difficult to implement such recommendations when patients require urgent, unplanned, major noncardiac surgery.

In our study, we observed, on average, a 24-hour delay from hospital admission to urgent surgery between patients with AF who were treated with and without oral anticoagulation. This delay may have been driven by physicians' decisions to wait for the effect of anticoagulants to be attenuated before proceeding with surgery. In spite of this time delay, the 30-day mortality and bleeding rates were similar between patients with anticoagulated and non-anticoagulated AF undergoing urgent surgery. Accordingly, our study provided pertinent data on perioperative outcomes of this high-risk cohort during a time when reversal agents for DOAC were not clinically available.

### Perioperative management of patients taking direct oral anticoagulants: A review [^116nqRDb]. JAMA (2024). High credibility.

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), comprising apixaban, rivaroxaban, edoxaban, and dabigatran, are commonly used medications to treat patients with atrial fibrillation and venous thromboembolism. Decisions about how to manage DOACs in patients undergoing a surgical or nonsurgical procedure are important to decrease the risks of bleeding and thromboembolism.

- **Observations**: For elective surgical or nonsurgical procedures, a standardized approach to perioperative DOAC management involves classifying the risk of procedure-related bleeding as minimal (e.g. minor dental or skin procedures), low to moderate (e.g. cholecystectomy, inguinal hernia repair), or high risk (e.g. major cancer or joint replacement procedures). For patients undergoing minimal bleeding risk procedures, DOACs may be continued, or if there is concern about excessive bleeding, DOACs may be discontinued on the day of the procedure. Patients undergoing a low to moderate bleeding risk procedure should typically discontinue DOACs 1 day before the operation and restart DOACs 1 day after. Patients undergoing a high bleeding risk procedure should stop DOACs 2 days prior to the operation and restart DOACs 2 days after. With this perioperative DOAC management strategy, rates of thromboembolism (0.2%-0.4%) and major bleeding (1%-2%) are low, and delays or cancellations of surgical and nonsurgical procedures are infrequent.

Patients taking DOACs who need emergent (< 6 hours after presentation) or urgent surgical procedures (6–24 hours after presentation) experience bleeding rates up to 23% and thromboembolism as…

### Perioperative management of patients on chronic antithrombotic therapy [^114pBZSJ]. Blood (2012). Low credibility.

Perioperative management of antithrombotic therapy frequently occurs and requires consideration of the patient, the procedure, and an expanding array of anticoagulant and antiplatelet agents. Preoperative assessment must address each patient's risk for thromboembolic events balanced against the risk for perioperative bleeding.

- **Low bleeding risk procedures**: These generally do not require the complete reversal of antithrombotic therapy.

- **Intermediate or high bleeding risk procedures**: For patients receiving warfarin who need the interruption of anticoagulation, consideration must be given to whether simply withholding the anticoagulant is optimal or if a perioperative "bridge" with an alternative agent, typically a low-molecular-weight heparin, should be used.

- **New oral anticoagulants**: Dabigatran and rivaroxaban have shorter effective half-lives but introduce other concerns for perioperative management. These include prolonged drug effects in patients with renal insufficiency, limited experience with clinical laboratory testing to confirm the lack of a residual anticoagulant effect, and the absence of a reversal agent.

- **Antiplatelet agents**: They must also be considered, with particular attention to the risk for thrombotic complications in patients with coronary artery stents when antiplatelet therapy is withheld.

### Spontaneous rectus sheath bleed while on DOAC anticoagulation [^115rZXrp]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). Low credibility.

DOACs are becoming increasingly prescribed. According to the American Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, apixaban was the 48th most commonly prescribed drug in 2020, surpassing both warfarin and rivaroxaban. They have been shown to be more efficacious, better tolerated, and safer than previous anticoagulants in the treatment of venous thromboembolism and prevention of stroke. They have a rapid onset of action, short half-life, do not require monitoring, and have fewer drug and dietary interactions than vitamin K antagonists. New antidotes for the reversal of acute major bleeding continue to be developed, further mitigating the risk of severe complications. As their prevalence continues to grow, so does the incidence of their uncommon but significant adverse effects.

Despite their favorable safety profile when compared with vitamin K antagonists, the risk of hemorrhage is nevertheless increased in prolonged anticoagulation, particularly in those with comorbid renal failure, liver failure, malignancies, or thrombocytopenia. Bleeding is the most common adverse effect of DOAC therapy, including an increased risk of major gastrointestinal bleeding, intracerebral hemorrhage, and clinically relevant non-major bleeding, as well as possibly increasing the risk when used in patients with trauma pre-injury. Several incidents of serious bleeds have been reported, many with no history of trauma. Spontaneous internal bleeding is difficult to diagnose quickly given its lack of signs and symptoms until the bleed has progressed significantly.

### Apixaban versus enoxaparin for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis in colorectal surgery [^111rPSm8]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2025). High credibility.

Guidelines recommend postoperative venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis in colorectal cancer patients, as well as others at high risk of VTE. However, compliance, especially with injectable prophylaxis strategies, remains challenging for patients and providers. This study evaluates the efficacy of apixaban versus enoxaparin in patients undergoing colorectal surgery (CRS) for postoperative VTE prophylaxis.

- **Methods**: This is a retrospective study conducted at a tertiary referral center using data from cases between January 2018 and May 2023. A total of 1008 patients were included; 388 received enoxaparin and 620 received apixaban following discharge from abdominal or combined abdominal-perianal CRS. Patients on anticoagulation before surgical intervention were excluded, as were those undergoing isolated stoma reversal or creation. The primary outcome was VTE within 30 days following discharge. The secondary outcome was bleeding, requiring transfusion, intervention, or readmission.

- **Results**: VTE rates were low in both groups but significantly higher in those who received enoxaparin compared to those who received apixaban (1.29% versus 0.16%, P = 0.023). Patients receiving apixaban were significantly older, had longer operative times, underwent more minimally invasive procedures, and were more likely to have cancer (P < 0.01 for all instances). Postoperative bleeding rates did not differ between groups.

- **Conclusions**: Patients undergoing CRS are effectively managed with apixaban as postdischarge VTE prophylaxis. VTE rates were lower in the apixaban group.

### Efficacy and safety considerations with dose-reduced direct oral anticoagulants: A review [^114pb5s3]. JAMA Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

Dose-reduced regimens of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) may be used for two main purposes: dose-adjusted treatment intended as full-intensity anticoagulation, for example, for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation (AF) in patients requiring dose reduction, or low-intensity treatment, such as extended-duration treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE). We reviewed randomized clinical trials (RCTs) to understand the scenarios in which dose-adjusted or low-intensity DOACs were tested. Additionally, we reviewed the labeled indications by regulatory authorities, using data from large registries to assess whether the use of dose-reduced DOACs in routine practice aligned with the findings of RCTs.

Among 4,191 screened publications, 35 RCTs that used dose-adjusted DOACs were identified for dabigatran, apixaban, rivaroxaban, and edoxaban. Of these 35 RCTs, 29 were related to stroke prevention in AF. Efficacy and safety results for dose-adjusted DOACs in large RCTs of AF were similar to those found for full-dose DOACs. To our knowledge, dabigatran, apixaban, and rivaroxaban have not been studied as dose-adjusted therapy for acute VTE treatment. Low-intensity DOACs were identified in 37 RCTs. Low-intensity DOACs may be used for extended-duration treatment of VTE (apixaban and rivaroxaban), primary prevention in orthopedic surgeries (dabigatran, apixaban, and rivaroxaban), primary prevention in ambulatory high-risk cancer patients (apixaban and rivaroxaban), or postdischarge high-risk medical patients (rivaroxaban), in stable atherosclerotic vascular disease, or following a recent cardiovascular event.

### Evidence gaps in the era of non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants [^111ZNjDp]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

In RE‐ALIGN, most valvular thrombosis occurred in the immediate postoperative period, suggesting that the increased release of pro‐thrombotic substances after surgery overwhelms the capacity of dabigatran to antagonize thrombin. Anticoagulation in this setting should occur with frequent and individualized dose adjustments that match the unpredictably released pro‐coagulant factors and maintain a net anticoagulant effect. Although by study design, dabigatran was dosed up to twice the Food and Drug Administration-approved dose for AF to achieve circulating levels > 50 ng/mL, this might not reflect the true anticoagulation effect of dabigatran at the valve level in the setting of unpredictable bursts of pro‐thrombotic factors after surgery. However, patients receiving dabigatran had a higher risk of bleeding compared with those receiving VKA.

- **Comparison of anticoagulation methods**: Contrary to this, INR measurements reflect the net anticoagulation effect of VKAs and enable individualized dose adjustment to achieve the desired level of anticoagulation. Given their short half‐lives, monitoring the net anticoagulation effect of NOACs in this dynamic setting would be challenging. Furthermore, dabigatran is a competitive inhibitor of a single coagulation factor, while VKAs are noncompetitive irreversible inhibitors of multiple coagulation factors of both the intrinsic and extrinsic coagulation pathways, as well as factor X and thrombin in the common pathway.

VKAs remain the anticoagulation modality of choice in patients with mechanical valves.
