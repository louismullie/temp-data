## Question

Tizanidine headache

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about tizanidine's role in headache management, including indications, dosing, efficacy, safety, and how to position it among alternatives. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the regulatory status and labeled versus off-label indications. Then, I should verify dosing regimens for chronic tension-type headache and migraine prevention. Next, I will review the quality and direction of evidence, including guideline positions. After that, I need to check safety, monitoring, and drug–drug interactions. Finally, I will integrate this into a practical, patient-centered algorithm and highlight special populations and uncertainties that could change practice.

> Let me first confirm the regulatory status and indications. Tizanidine is FDA-approved for management of spasticity; its use for headache prevention is off-label, with sources listing prevention of chronic tension-type headache and migraine attacks as recognized off-label indications, which aligns with how it is described in compendia and clinical references [^1119QYqF] [^114LK9vn] [^116j11ZF].

> I need to verify dosing next. For chronic tension-type headache prevention, a commonly cited regimen is to start 2 mg orally at bedtime and titrate to a maintenance of 8 mg three times daily; for migraine prevention, sources describe starting 2 mg at bedtime and titrating to 2–4 mg three times daily, with a maximum total daily dose of 24 mg, though I should note that the highest-quality guideline evidence is insufficient to endorse any specific preventive over another, so these dosing schemas reflect labeling summaries rather than guideline-backed standards [^113KomRD] [^114HT6eB] [^111Ucmuv].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about efficacy. I should review the strength of evidence. The VA/DoD 2023 guideline concludes there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against any specific preventive medication for migraine, tension-type, or cluster headache, which places tizanidine in a category of uncertain comparative effectiveness; earlier primary care guidance suggested considering tizanidine for chronic tension-type headache, but this reflects lower-certainty recommendations rather than high-quality comparative data [^111Ucmuv] [^112d2W4D]. Systematic reviews of skeletal muscle relaxants for chronic pain, including headache, show mixed and generally low-quality results for tizanidine in headache populations, with some signals of benefit but substantial heterogeneity and risk of bias, reinforcing the uncertainty [^115cWqza] [^113tX9RF].

> Wait, let me verify the mechanistic rationale. Tizanidine is a centrally acting alpha-2 adrenergic agonist that reduces excitatory neurotransmitter release and modulates facilitatory spinal pathways, which provides a biologically plausible basis for antinociceptive and muscle relaxant effects that could mitigate tension-type mechanisms; however, mechanistic plausibility does not substitute for robust clinical efficacy data in headache populations, and guideline bodies have not elevated tizanidine to first- or second-line preventive status on that basis alone [^117YRjGw] [^115v4UvK].

> I should confirm safety and monitoring requirements before recommending use. Common adverse effects include somnolence, dizziness, dry mouth, asthenia, fatigue, and hypotension; tizanidine can cause hepatotoxicity, so baseline and periodic liver function monitoring is advised, particularly as doses increase or therapy is prolonged; abrupt discontinuation after prolonged high-dose use risks rebound hypertension and tachycardia, so tapering by 2–4 mg per day is recommended; in renal impairment with creatinine clearance less than 25 mL/min, reduce individual doses and monitor closely for hypotension and dizziness; coadministration with strong CYP1A2 inhibitors such as fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin is contraindicated due to markedly increased tizanidine levels and risk of hypotension and psychomotor impairment [^111HBQXz] [^115GL78X] [^111dbG4b] [^114HDwZ9] [^116K6Boi].

> Let me consider drug–drug interactions and additive CNS effects. Tizanidine's sedative effects are additive with other CNS depressants such as benzodiazepines, opioids, and tricyclic antidepressants, and its hypotensive effects may be cumulative with other alpha-2 agonists; smoking can reduce tizanidine exposure via CYP1A2 induction, potentially necessitating higher doses in heavy smokers, though this requires careful titration and monitoring for adverse effects [^116Ezdpi] [^115LEALs].

> Next, I should review where tizanidine fits among alternatives. For chronic tension-type headache, first-line preventives remain tricyclics such as amitriptyline, with mirtazapine or venlafaxine as second-line options; tizanidine may be considered when these are contraindicated, poorly tolerated, or as adjuncts in selected cases, but the evidence base is weaker and guideline endorsement is limited; for migraine prevention, established options include topiramate, beta-blockers, CGRP monoclonal antibodies, and onabotulinumtoxinA for chronic migraine, with tizanidine generally not prioritized given the lack of robust comparative data [^115v4UvK] [^113ZsxNQ] [^111AuxQW].

> I will now examine special populations and contexts. In older adults, tizanidine may be relatively better tolerated among muscle relaxants, but the risk of hypotension, falls, and sedation still warrants caution and dose conservatism; in patients with significant hepatic impairment, dose reductions are advised; in those with severe renal impairment, dose adjustments and close monitoring are essential; for medication-overuse headache, the priority is withdrawal of the overused acute medications and initiation of evidence-based preventives, with insufficient evidence to recommend a specific withdrawal strategy or preventive agent, so tizanidine would not be first choice in that scenario [^114o8mne] [^115GL78X] [^114HDwZ9] [^11464ztc].

> But wait, what if the clinical question is acute treatment rather than prevention. I should double-check that tizanidine has no role in acute headache treatment algorithms; contemporary guidelines and reviews emphasize NSAIDs, triptans, gepants, and lasmiditan for acute migraine, and simple analgesics or NSAIDs for tension-type headache, with no role for tizanidine as an abortive agent, so any use would be preventive and off-label rather than acute rescue [^111AuxQW] [^112dd8qV] [^112Ugc3U].

> Let me synthesize a practical approach. If a patient with chronic tension-type headache has failed or cannot tolerate first-line preventives like amitriptyline, a cautious trial of tizanidine may be reasonable: start 2 mg at bedtime, titrate by 2–4 mg increments every few days toward 8 mg three times daily if tolerated, with explicit counseling on sedation, dizziness, and hypotension; obtain baseline and follow-up liver enzymes; avoid coadministration with fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin; and if discontinuing after prolonged high-dose use, taper by 2–4 mg per day to mitigate withdrawal phenomena; throughout, set expectations that evidence is limited and that alternatives with stronger support should be prioritized when feasible [^113KomRD] [^115GL78X] [^116K6Boi] [^111dbG4b] [^111Ucmuv].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought the maximum daily dose for headache prevention was uniformly 36 mg based on the spasticity label, but I should correct that. While the spasticity labeling allows up to 36 mg/day, the headache-focused dosing summaries cite a maximum of 24 mg/day for migraine prevention, so I should align the ceiling with the indication-specific sources rather than the spasticity maximum when counseling patients on migraine prophylaxis dosing limits [^114HT6eB] [^115GL78X].

> Finally, I need to ensure shared decision-making and follow-up. Given the low-to-moderate quality of evidence and the potential for adverse effects, a time-limited therapeutic trial with predefined response criteria and a plan to deprescribe if goals are not met is prudent; concurrently, address medication overuse, sleep, mood, and trigger management, and consider nonpharmacologic therapies such as CBT or biofeedback, which can augment outcomes in chronic headache care even when pharmacologic prevention is modestly effective [^115B5Zwk] [^112dc4yL].

Tizanidine is **not indicated for acute headache treatment** [^117WWBox] and is not recommended for routine headache management. It is a centrally acting alpha-2 agonist approved for spasticity [^117WWBox], with **off-label use** for chronic tension-type headache prevention at 2–8 mg three times daily [^113KomRD] [^112d2W4D]. Evidence for headache prevention is limited and mixed; some guidelines suggest it may reduce frequency or severity in chronic tension-type headache, but high-quality evidence is lacking [^112d2W4D] [^113tX9RF]. Tizanidine is not effective for acute migraine or cluster headache and should not be used for acute headache relief. Common adverse effects include sedation, dizziness, dry mouth, and hypotension; serious risks include hepatotoxicity and withdrawal hypertension, so monitor liver function and taper slowly on discontinuation [^111HBQXz] [^115GL78X] [^111dbG4b].

## Clinical evidence for tizanidine in headache management

### Chronic tension-type headache (CTTH)

For chronic tension-type headache (CTTH), **preventive therapy** is supported by limited evidence; some guidelines suggest tizanidine may reduce frequency, severity, and duration, but high-quality data are lacking [^112d2W4D] [^111Ucmuv]. The **recommended dose** is 2 mg orally at bedtime, titrated to 8 mg three times daily as tolerated [^113KomRD].

---

### Migraine

For migraine, **preventive therapy** has insufficient evidence; tizanidine is not recommended for routine migraine prevention [^notfound]. The **recommended dose** is 2 mg orally at bedtime, titrated to 2–4 mg three times daily, with a maximum of 24 mg/day [^114HT6eB].

---

### Cluster headache

For cluster headache, **acute therapy** has no supporting evidence; tizanidine is not recommended for acute or preventive treatment.

---

## Mechanism of action relevant to headache management

Tizanidine's **alpha-2 agonism** reduces sympathetic outflow and may modulate pain pathways, but its relevance to primary headache pathophysiology is limited compared with established preventives [^117WWBox].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

| **Headache type** | **Guideline recommendation** | **Evidence level** |
|-|-|-|
| Chronic tension-type headache | Consider tizanidine as a preventive option | Limited evidence |
| Migraine | Insufficient evidence to recommend tizanidine | Insufficient evidence |
| Cluster headache | Not recommended | No evidence |

---

Overall, **guideline stance** is that tizanidine is not a first-line preventive for migraine or cluster headache; consider it only when standard therapies fail or are contraindicated [^notfound].

---

## Safety profile and adverse effects

### Common adverse effects

- Sedation/drowsiness
- Dizziness
- Dry mouth
- Hypotension
- Fatigue
- Constipation

---

### Serious adverse effects

- **Hepatotoxicity**: Monitor liver function tests at baseline and during therapy [^115GL78X].
- **Withdrawal hypertension**: Taper slowly to avoid rebound hypertension and tachycardia [^111dbG4b].
- **Hypersensitivity reactions**: Rare anaphylaxis and angioedema reported [^117N7GG9].

---

## Comparison with other headache medications

| **Medication class** | **Examples** | **Efficacy** | **Safety considerations** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Triptans | Sumatriptan, rizatriptan | High efficacy for acute migraine | Contraindicated in cardiovascular disease |
| NSAIDs | Ibuprofen, naproxen | Effective for mild-moderate headache | Gastrointestinal bleeding risk |
| Beta-blockers | Propranolol | Effective for migraine prevention | Bradycardia, fatigue |
| Antidepressants | Amitriptyline | Effective for chronic headache | Sedation, weight gain |
| Tizanidine | Tizanidine | Limited evidence | Sedation, hepatotoxicity, withdrawal hypertension |

---

Tizanidine is **less effective** than standard acute and preventive therapies and carries notable safety concerns, limiting its role [^113tX9RF].

---

## Patient populations and clinical scenarios

- **Chronic tension-type headache**: Consider when first-line agents (e.g. amitriptyline) are ineffective or contraindicated [^112d2W4D].
- **Migraine**: Not recommended for routine prevention; consider only in refractory cases with caution [^115cWqza].
- **Cluster headache**: Not recommended [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion and clinical recommendations

Tizanidine is **not indicated for acute headache treatment** and has a limited role in prevention, mainly for chronic tension-type headache when standard therapies fail [^1119QYqF] [^112d2W4D]. Evidence is limited, and safety concerns (sedation, hepatotoxicity, withdrawal hypertension) require careful monitoring and slow tapering [^115GL78X] [^111dbG4b]. It should not replace established headache therapies and should be used cautiously in select cases.

### Chronic headache: new advances in treatment strategies [^112buBGe]. Neurology (2002). Low credibility.

Chronic daily headache (CDH) affects approximately 4 to 5% of the population and encompasses a number of different diagnoses, including transformed migraine, chronic tension-type headache (TTH), new-onset daily persistent headache, and hemicrania continua. Although the pathophysiology of CDH is still poorly understood, some research has suggested that each of the various subtypes of CDH may have a different pathogenesis. The goals of prophylactic therapy are to reduce the frequency, severity, and duration of headache attacks; to improve responsiveness to treatment of acute attacks; to improve function; and to reduce disability. However, opinions differ as to exactly which are the best and most appropriate outcome measures for prophylaxis. Several pharmacologic treatment options exist, including antidepressants, anticonvulsants, muscle relaxants, serotonin agonists, ergots, serotonin antagonists, antianxiety agents, and other miscellaneous drugs. Tizanidine, an alpha(2)-adrenergic agonist, has recently emerged as a promising prophylactic adjunct for CDH, which implicates a central alpha(2)-adrenergic mechanism as an important factor in the pathophysiology of CDH.

### Chronic daily headache: diagnosis and management [^115B5Zwk]. American Family Physician (2014). Low credibility.

Chronic daily headache is defined as the presence of a headache on 15 days or more per month for at least three months. The most common types of chronic daily headache are chronic migraines and chronic tension-type headaches. If a red flag for a secondary cause of headache is present, magnetic resonance imaging of the head should be performed. All patients should be asked about medication overuse, which can increase the frequency of headaches. Patients who overuse medications for abortive therapy for headache should be encouraged to stop the medications entirely and consider prophylactic treatment. Several prophylactic treatments for chronic daily headache can reduce headache frequency and severity, as well as improve overall quality of life. Nonpharmacologic treatments include relaxation techniques, cognitive behavior therapy, acupuncture, osteopathic manipulation, and cervical exercises. Pharmacologic therapies include amitriptyline, gabapentin, onabotulinumtoxinA, propranolol, tizanidine, topiramate, and valproate.

### Tizanidine: advances in pharmacology&therapeutics and drug formulations [^114o8mne]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In addition to relieving muscle spasms and chronic musculoskeletal pain, tizanidine is a particular SMR that exhibits multiple beneficial characteristics. Tizanidine is a relatively safer SMR and seems to be friendly to older adults. It can be expected that there will be more scientific studies on tizanidine as well as wider therapeutic applications. New delivery systems will also be available to better meet clinical needs.

### New therapeutic developments in chronic migraine [^117ToQCE]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Chronic migraine is a common cause of chronic daily headache, which is often refractory to standard treatment. New research has increased our understanding of this disorder and its treatment. This review focuses on recent clinical trials and advances in our understanding of migraine pathophysiology.

Recent Findings

Migraine research has traditionally focused on the more common episodic form of the disorder, but recent clinical trials have started to focus on chronic migraine or chronic daily headache. Topiramate, onabotulinum toxin type A, gabapentin, petasites and tizanidine are among the agents that appear to be effective in the treatment of chronic migraine. New acute medications including an inhaled form of dihydroergotamine will soon be available and neuromodulatory procedures such as occipital nerve stimulation may be effective for the most disabled patients. In the past few years, other studies have shed light on potential risk factors for chronic migraine such as medication-overuse headache, temporomandibular disorders, obstructive sleep apnea and obesity.

Summary

This review explains advances in the treatment of chronic migraine, a common disorder seen in neurological practice. These new advances in preventive treatment and a better understanding of its risk factors will allow clinicians to better identify individuals at greatest risk and prevent the development of chronic migraine.

Preoperative Use

A double-blinded randomized study confirmed the effects of clonidine and tizanidine on early postoperative pain in patients undergoing lumbar fusion surgery. Each group received the corresponding drug orally 1 h before surgery (group A: 4 mg tizanidine, group B: 4 mg clonidine; group C: placebo). The three groups exhibited statistically different visual analogue scale (VAS) at 2nd and 4th postoperative hours, despite comparable pain scores at 6, 12, 24 and 48 postoperative hours. The incidence of side effects (dizziness, nausea, vomiting, drowsiness, headache, and bradycardia) was comparable among the three groups. Another randomized clinical trial study reported the benefits of tizanidine for the management of postoperative pain after lumbar spinal fusion surgery. Patients received 4 mg oral tizanidine or placebo 1 h before surgery and 24 h after that. The tizanidine group had a significantly lower pain score at 24 and 48 h, and less morphine consumption after surgery compared with placebo (P < 0.005), with comparable incidence of side effects between two groups.

The Society for Perioperative Assessment and Quality Improvement (SPAQI) provides consensus on preoperative pain medication dosing. For example, tizanidine and baclofen could be taken preoperatively including the day of surgical procedure, whereas other SMRs (methocarbamol, orphenadrine, metaxalone, cyclobenzaprine) should be held on day of surgical procedure. According to expert consensus on perioperative management in enhanced recovery after spinal surgery in China and expert consensus on the implementation of enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) in percutaneous endoscopic interlaminar lumbar decompression/discectomy (2020), the addition of nerve repair agents, SMRs and anticonvulsants on the basis of sufficient regular use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can improve the overall efficacy and patient satisfaction in the management of perioperative radiculalgia.

### Headache management: pharmacological approaches [^116xSym2]. Practical Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusions

The effective management of headache disorders remains a moving field and a potential challenge to the neurologist. The frequency of headache and its burden of disability make it essential for neurologists to manage headache in an informed way. Therapeutic decisions are hampered by minimal evidence to support the use of many therapies and hence we a need large, robust clinical trials. However, emerging therapies specifically targeting headache pain pathways are likely to improve significantly the management options and advance the field.

A practical approach is important — using existing evidence and guidelines — to enable effective headache management. It is an area where the clinician can have a huge and very rewarding impact upon patient care.

Key points

Headache is a common cause of disability; an accurate diagnosis is essential, though is often delayed or missed.
Medication-overuse headache frequently coexists and should be actively sought and discussed with patients with headache.
National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends acute migraine abortive treatment with a triptan together with paracetamol (or a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug) plus an antiemetic; lack of efficacy with one triptan does not mean that others will not work.
NICE guidelines for migraine prophylaxis suggest using topiramate or a beta blocker; comorbidities or lack of efficacy often means that other agents are also prescribed.
Start migraine prophylactic agents at low dose, build the dose up progressively and maintain a therapeutic dose for 3 months before judging its efficacy.

### Non-antiepileptic drugs for trigeminal neuralgia [^117UC4DM]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Trigeminal neuralgia was defined by the International Association for the Study of Pain as a sudden, usually unilateral, severe, brief, stabbing recurrent pain in the distribution of one or more branches of the fifth cranial nerve. Standard treatment is with anti-epileptic drugs. Non-antiepileptic drugs have been used in the management of trigeminal neuralgia since the 1970s. This is an update of a review first published in 2006 and previously updated in 2011.

Objectives

To systematically review the efficacy and tolerability of non-antiepileptic drugs for trigeminal neuralgia.

Search Methods

On 20 May 2013, for this updated review, we searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL (2013, Issue 4), MEDLINE (January 1966 to May 2013), EMBASE (January 1980 to May 2013), LILACS (January 1982 to May 2013) and the Chinese Biomedical Retrieval System (1978 to May 2013). We searched clinical trials registries for ongoing trials.

Selection Criteria

We included double-blind, randomised controlled trials in which the active drug was used either alone or in combination with other non-antiepileptic drugs for at least two weeks.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors decided which trials fitted the inclusion criteria and independently graded risk of bias. We assessed the quality of the evidence according to the GRADE criteria for this update.

Main Results

In this 2013 update, we updated the searches, but identified only two new ongoing studies. The review includes four trials involving 139 participants. The primary outcome measure in each was pain relief. Three trials compared one of the oral non-antiepileptic drugs tizanidine, tocainide or pimozide with carbamazepine. The quality of evidence for all outcomes for which data were available was low. In a trial of tizanidine involving 12 participants (one dropped out due to unrelated disease), one of five participants treated with tizanidine and four of six treated with carbamazepine improved (risk ratio (RR) 0.30, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.05 to 1.89). Few side effects were noted with tizanidine. For pimozide, there was evidence of greater efficacy than carbamazepine at six weeks. Up to 83% of participants reported adverse effects but these did not lead to withdrawal; the report did not provide comparable data for carbamazepine. Limited data meant that we could not assess the effects of tocainide; however, data from non-randomised studies (not included in this review) indicate that serious haematological adverse events can occur. A trial involving 47 participants compared 0.5% proparacaine hydrochloride eyedrops with placebo but did not show any significant benefits, again according to low-quality evidence. The report did not mention adverse events. The proparacaine trial was at low risk of bias; the other trials were at unclear risk of bias overall.

Authors' Conclusions

There is low-quality evidence that the effect of tizanidine is not significantly different than that of carbamazepine in treating trigeminal neuralgia. Pimozide is more effective than carbamazepine, although the evidence is of low quality and the data did not allow comparison of adverse event rates. There is also low-quality evidence that 0.5% proparacaine hydrochloride eye drops have no benefit over placebo. Limitations in the data for tocainide prevent any conclusions being drawn. There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to show significant benefit from non-antiepileptic drugs in trigeminal neuralgia. More research is needed.

### Tizanidine: advances in pharmacology&therapeutics and drug formulations [^114a6UbS]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Based on prescribing information, tizanidine is a centrally acting alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonist indicated for the management of spasticity. In our geriatric practice, tizanidine is sometimes used as preemptive analgesia in older adults undergoing elective surgery. Such off-label use drove us to search for recent advances in the pharmacology and therapeutics of tizanidine. An update review of tizanidine is thus presented, aiming to bring the latest advances to clinicians and promote further research and practical exploration.

### Non-antiepileptic drugs for trigeminal neuralgia [^115USqbx]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Non-antiepileptic drugs have been used in trigeminal neuralgia management since the 1970s.

Objectives

The objective was to review systematically the efficacy of non-antiepileptic drugs for trigeminal neuralgia.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Register, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and LILACS (all to August 2005) and the Chinese Biomedical Retrieval System, the database of the Chinese Cochrane Center (The Cochrane Library, Issue 1 2005), conference paper databases and checked bibliographies. We handsearched ten Chinese journals.

Selection Criteria

We searched for randomized or quasi-randomized controlled trials.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors decided which trials fitted the inclusion criteria and graded methodological quality independently.

Main Results

Nine trials of different non-antiepileptic drugs involving 223 participants were included. Each trial investigated one non-antiepileptic drug. Two trials tested baclofen. In one, more people gained 50% reduction from baseline than with placebo (relative risk 15.00, 95% CI 0.97 to 231.84, P value = 0.05). In the other, slightly more participants on baclofen had a 75% reduction in attacks on the 10th day compared with carbamazepine (relative risk 2.38, 95% CI 0.83 to 6.85, P value = 0.11). One trial showed no significant difference in reduction in average daily frequency of attacks with L-Baclofen compared with racemic baclofen. Tizanidine was investigated in two trials. In one, the proportion of people with reduction in the average number of paroxysms per day increased with tizanidine compared with placebo (relative risk 8.00, 95% CI 1.21 to 52.69, P value = 0.03). In the other, one of five participants improved in visual analog scale score with tizanidine and four of six with carbamazepine (relative risk 0.30, 95% CI 0.05 to 1.89, P value = 0.20). One study showed that the improvement in mean values of pain scores with tocainide was similar to that of carbamazepine. In one study more participants improved during the pimozide than the carbamazepine period (relative risk 1.78, 95% CI 1.39 to 2.28). In one study, proparacaine hydrochloride 0.5% instillation into the eyes was not significantly different from placebo (relative risk 1.06, 95% CI 0.37 to 2.99, P value = 0.92). In another, there was moderate or marked improvement in seven of nine participants treated with clomipramine and three of nine with amitriptyline after a 12-week treatment (RR 2.33, 95% CI 0.87 to 6.27).

Authors' Conclusions

There is insufficient evidence from randomized controlled trials to show significant benefit from non-antiepileptic drugs in trigeminal neuralgia. More research is needed.

### Headache management: pharmacological approaches [^113LL1wN]. Practical Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

The triptans

We advise patients to use a triptan at the start of the headache phase of a migraine attack, since there is no evidence of efficacy if taken during preceding aura. Using a triptan at the start of the headache may reduce headache recurrence, prevent disability and possibly reduce central sensitisation. The difficulty arises in chronic migraineurs, since taking the triptan early can lead to a pattern of increasing use and medication-overuse headache. We try to help these people to identify early features that might indicate an ensuing severe migraine attack, as the triptan should be reserved for these headaches. It is important to explain that the triptan should be used, on average, on no more than 2 days per week (10 days per month) to reduce the risk of a triptan-overuse headache.

Our own practice is to try any particular triptan on at least three occasions before assessing its efficacy. Poor efficacy or tolerability with a single triptan does not reliably predict response to another, so it is definitely worthwhile working through different agents. However, choosing the right triptan for a given situation can be difficult, especially when considering second-line or third-line choices. Figure 1 and the following section may assist this decision.

Figure 1
Triptan selection in acute migraine. An approach to triptan selection based on the characteristic of acute attacks. BD, twice daily; NSAID, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug; TDS, three times a day.

Which triptan and how do they work?

The seven triptans — almotriptan, eletriptan, frovatriptan, naratriptan, rizatriptan, sumatriptan, zolmitriptan — are 5HT 1B/1D receptor agonists with vasoconstrictive effects on blood vessels. The choice of triptan depends on efficacy, side effects, the duration of the headache, coexisting vomiting and cost (table 2).

Interventions for Headaches

Among 10 studies of interventions for headaches, including trigeminal neuralgia, 6 were RCTs, and 4 were cohort studies, including a total of 558 patients in the intervention arms (eTable 3 in the Supplement). Four studies focused on tizanidine, 3 on baclofen, and 1 each on cyclobenzaprineand orphenadrine. Studies involving tizanidine demonstrated improvement from baseline in pain severity; 1 six-week RCTdemonstrated improvement vs placebo, and another, also a 6-week RCT, did not. Drowsiness, dry mouth, vivid dreams, and hallucinations were reported in tizanidine groups; in 1 study,25% of participants in the tizanidine group dropped out due to adverse effects. Studies involving baclofen demonstrated improvement from baseline; 1 studycomparing baclofen and carbamazepine vs carbamazepine alone found improved reduction of pain in the combination group. Adverse effect incidence ranged from none to 35% and included sedation, vomiting, diarrhea, nausea, weakness, and constipation. Orphenadrine compared with diazepamand cyclobenzaprine compared with placebodid not confer improved reductions in symptoms.

Interventions for Painful Cramps or Spasticity

Among 10 studies of interventions for painful cramps or spasticity, 8 were RCTs, and 2 were cohort studies; they included 330 patients in total in the intervention arms (eTable 4 in Supplement 1). Six addressed nocturnal leg cramps, with 4 of these, among patients with cirrhosis of the liver. Overall, 3 focused on baclofen, 2 focused on orphenadrine, 2 on carisoprodol, 2 on quinine, and 1 on methocarbamol. Baclofen was associated with significant improvements in cramp frequency, duration, and severity compared with placebo, but not when compared with transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation. Orphenadrine, carisoprodol, and methocarbamol were associated with improved cramp frequency beyond placebo. Adverse effects were documented for the baclofen, orphenadrine, and carisoprodol groups.

### Long-term use of muscle relaxant medications for chronic pain: a systematic review [^115cWqza]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Importance

Stricter opioid prescribing guidelines have increased prescriptions of skeletal muscle relaxants (SMRs) for chronic pain, but the efficacy of long-term use of SMRs for chronic pain is unknown.

Objective

To systematically review the effectiveness or efficacy of long-term use of SMRs for chronic pain.

Evidence Review

Two reviewers systematically searched Ovid MEDLINE, Embase (Ovid), Web of Science, CINAHL, and Cochrane through December 4, 2023. They included articles published in English, Spanish, or Italian. Only randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and cohort studies with comparator groups evaluating at least 1-month duration of SMRs for chronic pain were included. The reviewers dually reviewed data abstraction, risk-of-bias, and quality. They characterized studies by chronic pain syndrome: low back pain, fibromyalgia, headaches, painful cramps or spasticity, and other syndromes.

Findings

A total of 30 RCTs with 1314 participants and 14 cohort studies with 1168 participants assessed SMRs for chronic pain. Studies were primarily short-term (4–6 weeks). Nine unique SMRs were represented by the studies identified. Eleven studies (25%) examined baclofen, 8 (18%) examined tizanidine, and 7 (16%) examined cyclobenzaprine. Evidence for effectiveness was strongest for SMRs used for trigeminal neuralgia, neck pain, and painful cramps; evidence suggested SMRs for fibromyalgia, low back pain, and other syndromes were not more beneficial than placebo. The most common adverse effects were sedation and dry mouth. RCTs had a low to moderate risk of bias, and the quality of cohort studies was fair to good.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this systematic review of long-term use of SMRs for chronic pain, findings suggest that their long-term use may benefit patients with painful spasms or cramps and neck pain; their long-term use for low back pain, fibromyalgia, and headaches did not appear to be beneficial. Clinicians should be vigilant for adverse effects and consider deprescribing if pain-related goals are not met.

2.4 Drug Discontinuation

If therapy needs to be discontinued, particularly in patients who have been receiving high doses (20 mg to 36 mg daily) for long periods (9 weeks or more) or who may be on concomitant treatment with narcotics, the dose should be decreased slowly (2 mg to 4 mg per day) to minimize the risk of withdrawal and rebound hypertension, tachycardia, and hypertonia [see].

### Diagnosis and management of the primary headache disorders in the emergency department setting [^113m11io]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Headache continues to be a frequent cause of emergency department (ED) use, accounting for 2% of all visits. Most of these headaches prove to be benign but painful exacerbations of chronic headache disorders, such as migraine, tension-type, and cluster. The goal of ED management is to provide rapid and quick relief of benign headache, without causing undue side effects, and to recognize headaches with malignant course. Although these headaches have distinct epidemiologies and clinical phenotypes, there is overlapping response to therapy; nonsteroidals, triptans, dihydroergotamine, and the antiemetic dopamine antagonists may play a therapeutic role for each of these acute headaches. This article reviews the diagnostic criteria and management strategies for the primary headache disorders.

### Dynamic optimization of chronic migraine treatment: current and future options [^112qPLJY]. Neurology (2009). Low credibility.

Comparator studies that assess treatment effects in a clinical setting have improved the understanding of the efficacy and tolerability of prophylactic treatments for chronic migraine (CM). It is premature to recommend device-based treatments, such as occipital nerve stimulation, vagal nerve stimulation, and patent foramen ovale closure for CM, because clinical trials are in the preliminary stages. Physical therapy techniques, like applying heat or cold packs, ultrasonography, and electrical stimulation, have been shown to lessen pain. Nonpharmacologic treatments, including cognitive behavioral therapy, stress management, and biofeedback, have been investigated and proved effective in some areas of pain management, including migraine. However, pharmacologic interventions may be necessary for effective, long-term prophylaxis. Several medications under investigation, including topiramate, gabapentin, tizanidine, and amitriptyline, have proved efficacious in reducing the number of migraine episodes and the pain associated with migraine, although adverse events may prevent continued use of some agents. Evidence supports the use of botulinum toxin type A (BoNT-A) for CM, with or without medication overuse, to achieve a significant reduction in headache episodes. Efficacy of BoNT-A for CM is comparable with or better than that of valproate and topiramate, with better tolerability. Predictors of response to BoNT-A for CM appear to include predominantly unilateral location of the headache and the presence of cutaneous or muscle allodynia. BoNT-A has been demonstrated to be safe and well tolerated, with rare discontinuations due to adverse events. Recent clinical trials indicate that rational combination therapy may have a place in treating refractory CM. Well-controlled multicenter trials are awaited.

### Tackling chronic migraine: current perspectives [^112ycBfs]. Journal of Pain Research (2014). Low credibility.

Antiepileptic/antidepressants drugs

Several double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials showed that topiramate may cause a significant reduction of migraine days in CM patients. In the European Topiramate in Chronic Migraine (TOPCHROME) study, 32 patients received topiramate (mean dose, 100 mg/day), and 27 patients received a placebo. Topiramate significantly reduced the mean number of monthly migraine days by 3.5 compared with the placebo, and 22% of CM patients had a 50% or greater reduction in the mean number of headache days per month. In the US, a randomized clinical trial that included 306 CM patients evaluated the efficacy of topiramate in CM. Patients received a dose of 100 mg per day, and a decrease in mean monthly headache days was observed (5.8 days for topiramate versus 4.7 for placebo treatment). Both studies demonstrated the efficacy and safety of topiramate as preventive medication for CM patients with and without medication overuse. The post hoc analysis of CM patients with overuse medication concluded that detoxification prior to initiating prophylactic therapy may not be required if medication overuse is present.

The efficacy of sodium valproate was evaluated in a small group of 29 CM patients and 41 chronic tension-type headache patients. Patients were randomized to 500 mg twice a day or placebo for 3 months, and a significant improvement in the severity and frequency of pain was reported in the CM subgroup. Other randomized clinical trials have assessed the efficacy of tizanidine (titrated to target dose of 24 mg) and gabapentin (titrated to 2,400 mg daily) in CM and a significantly lower rate of headache days as compared to placebo were found.

The Amitriptyline Versus Placebo Study Group published a reanalysis of a clinical trial that included 391 subjects. For the subgroup with chronic daily headache, amitriptyline titrated to 100 mg daily was significantly superior to placebo at 8 weeks and at 16 weeks. In addition, there was a trend for amitriptyline to be superior to placebo at 12 weeks and at 20 weeks, but this did not reach significance.

### Guidelines of the international headache society for controlled trials of acute treatment of migraine attacks in adults: fourth edition [^1178a9rF]. Cephalalgia (2019). Medium credibility.

1.3.4.3. Total freedom from migraine

Recommendations:

1.3.4.3.1. The absence of pain, nausea, vomiting, photophobia, and phonophobia at the primary efficacy time point (i.e. 2 hours after treatment in most acute trials) is defined as total freedom from migraine. This endpoint can be used as a secondary efficacy measure.

1.3.4.3.2. Freedom from headache and any migraine-associated symptoms may also be considered.

Comments:

Total freedom from migraine is a combined efficacy measure that addresses pain and associated symptoms. Statistically, it is up to four times more powerful than analyses using four separate co-primary endpoints, as the majority of people with migraine do not exhibit all associated symptoms, and because these endpoints are not necessarily independent. In a post-hoc analysis based on pooled data from the rizatriptan clinical drug development program, rates of total freedom from migraine were 35% for rizatriptan and 8% for placebo. Rates of total freedom from migraine tend to be discouragingly low and often underestimate the benefits of effective acute treatments.

Background

Headache is listed among the WHO's major causes of disability with a global prevalence of 47% (symptoms occurring at least once in the past year). It is the commonest neurological syndrome presenting to primary care with 3% of adults consulting a general practitioner for headache each year. Women are disproportionately affected (3:1) and its higher prevalence among those of working age adds to the socioeconomic burden with loss of productivity, estimated at £2.25 billion per year in the UK.

In neurological practice, headache accounts for 25% of new referrals and yet a large proportion of these patients feel dissatisfied even if they make it to the neurology clinic, partly due to a reported lack of interest in the disorder by the reviewing neurologist. Most patients with headache have migraine, and when this diagnosis is made it is usually correct (98%). However, a quarter of patients with migraine have as their diagnosis missed. Furthermore, of those identified as a non-migrainous primary headache, 82% actually have migraine or probable migraine.

Neurologists consequently see a lot of patients with headache and the condition is very disabling for individuals. A diagnosis, empathy and effective treatment make a huge difference to the patient and can be very rewarding for the clinician. The purpose of this article, the first of two linked articles, is to provide an up-to-date overview of the pharmacological management of common headache disorders (as well as a limited number of non-pharmaceutical strategies).

5.6 Hypersensitivity Reactions

Tizanidine can cause anaphylaxis. Signs and symptoms including respiratory compromise, urticaria, and angioedema of the throat and tongue have been reported. Patients should be informed of the signs and symptoms of severe allergic reactions and instructed to discontinue tizanidine and seek immediate medical care should these signs and symptoms occur [see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4)].

5.7 Increased Risk of Adverse Reactions in Patients with Renal Impairment

Tizanidine should be used with caution in patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min), as clearance is reduced by more than 50%. In these patients, during titration, the individual doses should be reduced. If higher doses are required, individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased. These patients should be monitored closely for the onset or increase in severity of the common adverse events (dry mouth, somnolence, asthenia and dizziness) as indicators of potential overdose [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.2) and USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS (8.6)].

5.8 Withdrawal Adverse Reactions

Withdrawal adverse reactions include rebound hypertension, tachycardia, and hypertonia. To minimize the risk of these reactions, particularly in patients who have been receiving high doses (20 to 28 mg daily) for long periods of time (9 weeks or more) or who may be on concomitant treatment with narcotics, the dose should be decreased slowly (2 to 4 mg per day) [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.2)].

CTN pharmacotherapy — carbamazepine (CBZ) demonstrates robust efficacy with defined tolerability, and oxcarbazepine (OXC) yields comparable pain reduction. Four placebo-controlled studies totaling 147 patients showed CBZ efficacy, with CBZ doses 300 to 2,400 mg a day and responses of 58 to 100% versus 0 to 40% on placebo; the number needed to treat to attain important pain relief was less than 2, while numbers needed to harm were 3 for minor and 24 for severe adverse events. Two Class II masked RCTs including 130 patients compared OXC 600–1,800 mg a day to CBZ, and reduction in pain was equally good for CBZ and OXC with 88% achieving a reduction of ≥ 50%. Conclusions state that "carbamazepine is established as effective" for controlling CTN pain, "oxcarbazepine is probably effective", "baclofen, lamotrigine, and pimozide are possibly effective", "topical ophthalmic anesthesia is probably ineffective", and "there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the efficacy of clonazepam, gabapentin, phenytoin, tizanidine, topical capsaicin, and valproate" for CTN.

Table 4 — Most commonly used oral medications in spasticity treatment — tizanidine dosing and safety: For children, initiate with 1 mg/day in 18 mo–7 y old children and 2 mg/ day in 7–12 y old children as initial doses, with those older than 12 y having similar dosing to that in adults. Adults take 2, 4, and 6 mg capsules or 2 and 4 mg tablets; dosage starts with 2 mg orally and may repeat every 6 to 8 h as needed, with gradual increases by 2 to 4 mg per dose at intervals of 1 to 4 days until there is a noticeably significant reduction of spasticity; maximum dosing is three doses every 24 h, up to 36 mg daily. Reported adverse effects include sedation/drowsiness, dizziness, constipation, hallucinations, nervousness, dyskinesia, with severe adverse reactions that are possible but extremely rare: anaphylaxis, severe hypotension, bradycardia, hepatotoxicity, and Stevens–Johnson syndrome. Additional information states that tizanidine is an alpha-2 agonist affecting excitatory amino acid release and facilitatory cerebrospinal pathways, that monitoring of creatinine, liver functions, and blood pressure is necessary in patients with high-dose and prolonged therapy, that extent of absorption is greater when taken with food and the tablet and capsule dosage forms are not bioequivalent when administered with food, and includes the directive: Recommendation is to taper the dose 2 to 4 mg per day to reduce the risk of tachycardia, rebound hypertension, and increased spasticity.

### Tizanidine [^115GL78X]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.1 Recommended Evaluation and Testing Before and After Initiating Tizanidine tablets

Monitoring of aminotransferase levels is recommended at baseline and 1 month after maximum dose is achieved [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

2.2 Recommended Dosage

The recommended starting dose is 2 mg by mouth every 6 to 8 hours, as needed, to a maximum of three doses in 24 hours.

Dosage can be gradually increased every 1 to 4 days by 2 mg to 4 mg at each dosebased on clinical response and tolerability. The maximum total daily dosage is 36 mg. Single doses greater than 16 mg have not been studied.

There are pharmacokinetic differences when administering tizanidine tablets between the fed or fasted state [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Tizanidine tablets may be taken with or without food; however, consistent administration with respect to food is recommended to reduce variability in tizanidine plasma exposure.

Because of the short duration of therapeutic effect, treatment with tizanidine tablets should be reserved for those daily activities and times when relief of spasticity is most important.

2.3 Recommended Dosage in Patients with Renal Impairment

In patients with creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min, use lower individual doses during titration. If higher doses are required, the individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

2.4 Recommended Dosage in Patients with Hepatic Impairment

In patients with hepatic impairment, use lowerindividual doses during titration. If higher doses are required, individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

2.5 Discontinuation of Tizanidine Tablets

When discontinuing tizanidine tablets, particularly in patients who have been receiving high doses for long periods or who may be on concomitant treatment with narcotics, decreasethe dosage by 2 mg to 4 mg per day to minimize the risk of withdrawal adverse reactions [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3)].

### Frequent headaches: evaluation and management [^113bvVmU]. American Family Physician (2020). Medium credibility.

Most frequent headaches are typically migraine or tension-type headaches and are often exacerbated by medication overuse. Repeated headaches can induce central sensitization and transformation to chronic headaches that are intractable, are difficult to treat, and cause significant morbidity and costs. A complete history is essential to identify the most likely headache type, indications of serious secondary headaches, and significant comorbidities. A headache diary can document headache frequency, symptoms, initiating and exacerbating conditions, and treatment response over time. Neurologic assessment and physical examination focused on the head and neck are indicated in all patients. Although rare, serious underlying conditions must be excluded by the patient history, screening tools such as SNNOOP10, neurologic and physical examinations, and targeted imaging and other assessments. Medication overuse headache should be suspected in patients with frequent headaches. Medication history should include nonprescription analgesics and substances, including opiates, that may be obtained from others. Patients who overuse opiates, barbiturates, or benzodiazepines require slow tapering and possibly inpatient treatment to prevent acute withdrawal. Patients who overuse other agents can usually withdraw more quickly. Evidence is mixed on the role of medications such as topiramate for patients with medication overuse headache. For the underlying headache, an individualized evidence-based management plan incorporating pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic strategies is necessary. Patients with frequent migraine, tension-type, and cluster headaches should be offered prophylactic therapy. A complete management plan includes addressing risk factors, headache triggers, and common comorbid conditions such as depression, anxiety, substance abuse, and chronic musculoskeletal pain syndromes that can impair treatment effectiveness. Regular scheduled follow-up is important to monitor progress.

Importance

Approximately 90% of people in the US experience headache during their lifetime. Migraine is the second leading cause of years lived with disability worldwide.

Observations

Primary headache disorders are defined as headaches that are unrelated to an underlying medical condition and are categorized into 4 groups: migraine, tension-type headache, trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias, and other primary headache disorders. Studies evaluating prevalence in more than 100 000 people reported that tension-type headache affected 38% of the population, while migraine affected 12% and was the most disabling. Secondary headache disorders are defined as headaches due to an underlying medical condition and are classified according to whether they are due to vascular, neoplastic, infectious, or intracranial pressure/volume causes. Patients presenting with headache should be evaluated to determine whether their headache is most likely a primary or a secondary headache disorder. They should be evaluated for symptoms or signs that suggest an urgent medical problem such as an abrupt onset, neurologic signs, age 50 years and older, presence of cancer or immunosuppression, and provocation by physical activities or postural changes. Acute migraine treatment includes acetaminophen, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and combination products that include caffeine. Patients not responsive to these treatments may require migraine-specific treatments including triptans (5-HT1B/D agonists), which eliminate pain in 20% to 30% of patients by 2 hours, but are accompanied by adverse effects such as transient flushing, tightness, or tingling in the upper body in 25% of patients. Patients with or at high risk for cardiovascular disease should avoid triptans because of vasoconstrictive properties. Acute treatments with gepants, antagonists to receptors for the inflammatory neuropeptide calcitonin gene-related peptide, such as rimegepant or ubrogepant, can eliminate headache symptoms for 2 hours in 20% of patients but have adverse effects of nausea and dry mouth in 1% to 4% of patients. A 5-HT1F agonist, lasmiditan, is also available for acute migraine treatment and appears safe in patients with cardiovascular risk factors. Preventive treatments include antihypertensives, antiepileptics, antidepressants, calcitonin gene-related peptide monoclonal antibodies, and onabotulinumtoxinA, which reduce migraine by 1 to 3 days per month relative to placebo.

Conclusions and Relevance

Headache disorders affect approximately 90% of people during their lifetime. Among primary headache disorders, migraine is most debilitating and can be treated acutely with analgesics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, triptans, gepants, and lasmiditan.

### Guidelines of the international headache society for controlled trials of acute treatment of migraine attacks in adults: fourth edition [^117YUryu]. Cephalalgia (2019). Medium credibility.

Additional challenges hindering clinical trials for the acute treatment of aura include the low incidence and relatively short duration of aura, together with the high inter-individual variability of aura characteristics. The adoption of alternative trial designs may help to overcome these challenges and the consequent lack of specific treatments for migraine-associated aura. As a first step, the trial protocol should clearly state if the objective is to abort or reduce the length of the aura or to reduce or eliminate the headache, as these are distinct outcomes that most likely have different neurobiologies. It should also specify that participants have a history of at least one aura or attack of migraine with aura per month. In trials where the expected effect of treatment is to prevent the headache phase, the primary efficacy endpoint should be the number of headaches following the aura, with pain freedom after 2 hours a secondary efficacy measure. When the focus is on headache prevention in migraine with aura, a feasible compromise can be aura followed by headache in at least 80% of the attacks. In trials where aura is the event of interest, the primary efficacy measure should be the duration of the aura.

2.2. Early intervention

To facilitate migraine diagnosis and assess whether acute treatment will be effective when headache intensity is moderate or severe, subjects in clinical trials are often required to wait until headache pain is of at least moderate intensity before they treat an attack. This is not how migraine attacks are treated in clinical practice, where early intervention may be the most effective acute treatment strategy. With many oral triptans, for example, early intervention has been shown to lead to a higher percentage of pain-free responses at 2 hours after treatment than traditional administration (i.e. when headache intensity is moderate or severe): 57% versus 43% for zolmitriptan 2.5 mg, 68% versus 47% for eletriptan, 53% versus 38% for almotriptan 12.5 mg, 58% versus 32% for sumatriptan 100 mg, and 66% versus 44% for rizatriptan 10 mg). Early treatment while pain is mild has been associated with higher pain free rates for non-triptan acute treatments as well.

Interventions for Fibromyalgia and Similar Disorders

Among 11 studies of intervention for fibromyalgia and similar disorders, 7 were RCTs, and 4 were cohort studies, and included a total of 391 patients (eTable 2 in Supplement 1). Five studies involved cyclobenzaprine, 3 involved tizanidine, and 1 study each involved chlormezanone, eperisone, and carisoprodol. Among those involving cyclobenzaprine, all were RCTs. In 3 studies, cyclobenzaprine was associated with improvement in sleep disturbance but with no difference from placebo in other outcomes. In an RCT comparing cyclobenzaprine with amitriptyline, both groups improved clinically over 6 months with no difference between groups. Prevalence of adverse effects ranged from none to 98% and included somnolence, dry mouth, and, for those taking a sublingual formulation, tongue and sublingual numbness. Among studies examining tizanidine for fibromyalgia, all were cohort studies, and documented improvements in pain intensity for participants beyond baseline; 1 studyexamined outcomes 1 week after tizanidine was stopped and noted that pain intensity worsened again. Prevalence of adverse effects were none to 66% and included somnolence, headaches, and dizziness. In RCTs examining chlormezanone and carisoprodol, pain was not improved in the intervention groups compared with placebo. A cohort study involving eperisoneshowed improvements in pain scales compared with celecoxib at 2, 4, and 6 weeks of treatment. Chlormezanone was associated with nausea (prevalence 48%); no adverse effects were noted for carisoprodol or eperisone.

### Tricyclic antidepressants and headaches: systematic review and meta-analysis [^116pKxwp]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

A fourth limitation is the lack of reporting on concomitant use of direct, "as needed", drugs. Although most of the studies included patient diaries on the use of analgesics during or before the study period, only four placebo controlled studies and two comparisons with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors provide any results, all showing insignificantly greater reduction in analgesic use among patients receiving tricyclics. When data are combined across headache types, there is evidence of reduction in analgesic use. However, it is possible that other trials collected but did not report their data; there may be a bias against presenting data suggesting less treatment benefit. Reducing the need for patient use of analgesics is an important goal of prophylactic therapy in general, and has the additional benefit of helping to prevent "rebound" or drug overuse headaches.

A fifth limitation is that it is impossible to tell from our data what the optimal dose is for preventing headaches. Meta-analysis is limited by the problem of aggregate data. Optimal dosing is a question that could be answered only with the availability of patient level data, given the relatively large number of trials that have been carried out and the fact that nearly all trials included titration of tricyclics.

Medication-overuse headache

Medication-overuse headache is headache occurring on 15 or more days per month, developing as a consequence of regular overuse of acute or symptomatic headache medication (simple analgesics and NSAIDs on 15 days or more; or triptans, opioids and combination analgesics on 10 days or more days per month) for over 3 months. It occurs in patients with pre-existing primary headache who, in association with regular acute medication use, develop a new type of headache or a marked worsening of their pre-existing headache. Phenotypically, the headaches usually resemble migraine or tension-type headache.

Medication-overuse headache is a common, frequently debilitating, sequel to pre-existing headache. Headaches develop on withdrawal of analgesics, triggering more analgesic usage, leading to a self-perpetuating cycle. The problem is more severe with overuse of triptans and opiates than, for example, NSAIDs and simple analgesics, but can develop following overuse of any analgesic. A detailed look at a patient's list of over-the-counter medication can be quite revealing (table 5).

Table 5
Common over-the-counter migraine acute treatments

Unfortunately, the process of withdrawing from analgesics is often challenging. Patients may develop not only a withdrawal or rebound headache but also nausea and other gastrointestinal disturbances (about a week for triptan withdrawal and up to 4 weeks for opiates and codeine-based medication). Before withdrawal, it is important that the patient is fully aware of the likely initial worsening of symptoms. The overused abortives should ideally be stopped for at least 1 month. It can be encouraging to the patient to explain the evidence that medication withdrawal alone can improve the headaches (see figure 3).

Figure 3
Headache frequency after medication withdrawal in medication-overuse headache. This Danish study of people with probable medication-overuse headache (175 patients) compared the frequency of headache before and after complete drug withdrawal and then after drug management in the clinic. Between the initial visit (before withdrawal) and discharge from clinic post-withdrawal, there was a mean reduction in headache frequency across the cohort of 46% (p < 0.0001). The values represent mean reduction in headache days per month with median and range in brackets. ✱ p < 0.0001 (adapted from Zeeburg et al).

Expert Consensus on Musculoskeletal Pain Management

According to expert consensus on the management of chronic musculoskeletal pain in older adults, muscle relaxants could usually be used for the treatment of chronic LBP by relieving skeletal muscle spasm and improving blood microcirculation. The expert consensus on the treatment of nerve root pain in degenerative spinal conditions describes that muscle relaxants such as tizanidine can be used for those with reactive muscle spasms. Eperisone and tizanidine are central muscle relaxants that can be used in the treatment of a variety of chronic pain.

According to the clinical guideline for nonspecific LBP in China, α2-adrenergic receptor agonists (such as tizanidine) not only have strong analgesic, muscle relaxant, and anti-anxiety effects, but also have a protective effect on the gastrointestinal tract, therefore the combination of this drug class with NSAIDs can effectively reduce low back pain, improve the range of motion, and offset the gastrointestinal injury caused by NSAIDs. According to Chinese expert consensus on diagnosis and treatment of sacroiliac joint pain, NSAIDs and/or muscle relaxants (such as tizanidine) should be given as soon as possible in patients who are less responsive to non-pharmacological treatments or whose pain is evident, whereas tramadol sustained-release tablets or strong opioid analgesics are recommended if pain interferes with sleep.

Headache

Classification According to the International Headache Society, primary headaches can be classified into migraine headaches, cluster headaches and tension-type headaches. Migraine headaches result from migraine disorders, which are further categorized as migraine with aura, migraine without aura, childhood migraine or retinal migraine depending upon the presentation.– Secondary headaches may be caused due to an underlying disorder such as tumors.
Diagnosis Preliminary diagnosis can be performed through symptom assessment and detailed evaluation of patient profile and history or presence of underlying disorders. A typical migraine attack is triggered by physical activity and may be suspected if symptoms involve severe pulsating or throbbing headache on one or both sides of the head, sometimes accompanied by visual aura, sensitivity to light, nausea or vomiting. Frequently occurring migraine attacks (≥ 15 days per month for > 3 months) despite continuing medication may be regarded as chronic migraine; the duration of headache may be 4–72 hours. Tension-type headaches, also known as ordinary headaches, may be triggered by stress. The pain is usually bilateral, with pressing/tightening quality and is not usually accompanied by nausea, vomiting or light sensitivity. Persistent tension-type headache may indicate the presence of serious underlying disorders. These headaches may last from a few minutes to days (up to 7 days). Cluster headaches usually involve severe unilateral pain around the eyes (orbital pain), forehead or sides of the head (temporal pain). These headaches may last for 10 minutes to 4 hours. Diagnosis by neuroimaging techniques should be reserved for patients who have persistent pain lasting 6-month duration, often in the absence of migraine and accompanied by neurologic symptoms such as confusion, visual problems and hallucinations; also to be used in the case of patients with history of such disorders in the past (B).
Treatment Migraine headache: begin initial treatment with oral triptans (sumatriptan or zolmitriptan), followed by the antiemetics prochlorperazine or chlorpromazine in case of nausea and vomiting (A); opioids and antidepressants may be considered as second-line therapy. In children, initial treatment may be initiated with acetaminophen and ibuprofen, followed by sumatriptan nasal spray or oral triptans (A).– Cluster and tension-type headaches: treatment for cluster and tension-type headaches should consist of acetaminophen, low-dose NSAIDs (ibuprofen, naproxen and diclofenac), followed by an NSAID–caffeine or acetaminophen–caffeine combination as second-line therapy (A).–

Cluster headache – triptan adverse effects and patient preferences — Reported adverse events (AEs) included local reaction paresthesia (the most common), sweating, feeling of heaviness, somnolence, nausea and vomiting, injection-site reaction (e.g., pain, swelling, burning, erythema, tingling), neurologic symptoms (e.g., dizziness, tiredness, numbness of hands, tingling, feeling of paralysis in the face, cold and hot sensations), bad taste, discomfort of nasal cavity, and pain or tightness in the throat, chest, or neck; AEs were more common with a triptan versus placebo but were generally mild or moderate in severity. Patient preferences vary little regarding the acute treatment of cluster headache, and despite intranasal and subcutaneous administration methods typically being less preferred than oral medications, patients with cluster headaches have less variability in acceptance of these alternative administration methods because the preference for rapid pain freedom is much stronger.

### Long-term use of muscle relaxant medications for chronic pain: a systematic review [^117RkJwe]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Description of Studies

We identified 5 studies that addressed low back pain (eTable 1 in Supplement 1), 11 studies that addressed fibromyalgia or related disorders (eTable 2 in Supplement 1), 10 studies that addressed headaches or trigeminal neuralgia (eTable 3 in Supplement 1), 10 studies that addressed painful muscle cramps or spasticity (eTable 4 in Supplement 1), and 8 studies that addressed other pain syndromes, including osteoarthritis, cervical spondylosis, neuropathy, cancer pain, gastric reflux–related pain, and orchialgia(eTable 5 in Supplement 1).

Nine muscle relaxant medications were represented by the studies identified. The most common were as follows: 11 studies (25%) examined baclofen, 8 (18%) examined tizanidine, and 7 (16%) examined cyclobenzaprine. Other studies examined eperisone, quinine, carisoprodol, orphenadrine, chlormezanone, and methocarbamol.

While a plurality of studies took place in the United States or Canada, 12 took place in Europe, 12 took place in Asia, 3 in Africa, and 1 in Australia/New Zealand. Other characteristics of the included studies are found in Table 2.

Characteristics of 44 Included Studies

Quality Assessment

The risk of bias among randomized clinical studies was low to moderate (eTable 6 in Supplement 1). Risk of bias most commonly manifested as lack of blinding of participants and personnel as well as lack of blinding of outcomes assessments. Cohort studies were of fair to good quality (eTable 7 in Supplement 1). The most common reasons for low quality assessment were low comparability of cohorts based on design or analysis (13 of 14) and low-quality selection of the nonexposed cohort (12 of 14).

Thirdly, the efficacy and safety of different SMRs deserve further investigation. For example, tolperisone is effective in the treatment of acute painful muscle spasm and spasticity without the somnolence associated with SMRs. A comparative study of tizanidine versus tolperisone has not been reported.

Fourthly, it is interesting to further investigate the effect of individual patient factors on the pharmacokinetics of SMRs. Genetic polymorphisms of CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 and cigarette smoking independently and significantly affected tolperisone pharmacokinetics, and these factors together may have a greater effect (eg, non-smoking patients with the CYP2D6✱10/✱10 and CYP2C19 PM genotype had a 25.9-fold increase in AUC compared to smokers with the CYP2D6*wt/*wt and CYP2C19 EM genotype). A two-fold increase in oral baclofen clearance was associated with the single-nucleotide polymorphism of ABCC9 (rs11046232, heterozygous AT versus TT genotype). Smoking can reduce plasma concentrations and the effects of tizanidine. Physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK)-model simulated disposition of tizanidine in various smoking sub-groups, showing that C max and AUC gradually decreased as the number of cigarettes smoked per day increased. For heavy smokers (> 20 cigarettes per day), the dose of tizanidine may need to be higher than the average dose because the simulated C max and AUC are reduced by about 50% compared to nonsmokers. Tizanidine is primarily metabolized by CYP1A2, so it is necessary to explore the effect of CYP1A2 genetic polymorphisms on the optimal dosing of tizanidine.

Recommendation strength and direction — general corresponding text and GRADE linkage are defined as follows: Strong for corresponds to "We recommend", Weak for to "We suggest", Neither for nor against to "There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against", Weak against to "We suggest against", and Strong against to "We recommend against". The guideline states that the determination of the strength of the recommendation is more directly linked to the confidence in the quality of the evidence on outcomes that are critical to clinical decision making, and notes that if the quality of evidence differs across the relevant critical outcomes, the lowest quality of evidence for any of the critical outcomes determines the overall quality of the evidence for a recommendation.

Preventive medications reduce migraine frequency and severity, and improve migraine-specific quality of life. Recent evidence also suggests that these same medications enhance the patient's response to acute migraine therapies, and may also reduce the likelihood of developing chronic daily headache. However, many patients who should receive or be offered preventive treatment are not. Most patients can be successfully managed when patient and physician expectations are realistic and aligned, the selection of preventive medications is individualised, and the initiation and titration strategy is appropriate and carefully followed. Rational combinations of preventive medications may also be useful. This review provides an evidence and experience-based approach to the preventive treatment of migraine.

### Doxazosin versus tizanidine for treatment of dysfunctional voiding in children: a prospective randomized open-labeled trial [^116VSXGF]. Urology (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine the efficacy and tolerability of tizanidine for the treatment of dysfunctional voiding in children compared with those of doxazosin.

Methods

A total of 40 children with dysfunctional voiding were enrolled in a prospective, randomized, 2-parallel group, flexible-dose study. The evaluations were performed in accordance with the International Children's Continence Society guidelines. The children were followed up after 1 week and then monthly for 6 months for the clinical, urine culture, and urodynamic parameters. The degree of improvement was assessed using a satisfaction scale that ranged from 0 (no improvement at all) to 10 (total improvement).

Results

A total of 40 patients with a mean ± SD age of 7 ± 2.6 years were enrolled. The clinical and urodynamic parameters were comparable between both groups. At the last follow-up visit, both groups had had similar improvement in the severity of symptoms, satisfaction scale, and noninvasive flowmetry parameters. In the doxazosin group, urge episodes was the only symptom that showed a significant reduction compared with the baseline values (P = 0.028). However, the incidence of nocturnal enuresis, urgency attacks, and daytime incontinence were significantly reduced compared with baseline in the tizanidine group (P = 0.003, P = 0.008, and P = 0.017, respectively). Adverse effects were recorded in 6 patients (15%). Epigasteric pain was reported in 2 children (10%) who received doxazosin. In the tizanidine group, a loss of appetite was noted in 2 children (10%), epigastric pain in 1 (5%), and headache in 1 (5%).

Conclusion

Tizanidine could be a safe and effective treatment of children with dysfunctional voiding due to pelvic floor/skeletal sphincter dysfunction. More placebo-controlled trails with larger sample sizes are needed.

7.6 Other CNS Depressants

The sedative effects of tizanidine with CNS depressants (e.g., benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) may be additive. Monitor patients who take tizanidine with another CNS depressant for symptoms of excess sedation [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

7.7 α2-Adrenergic Agonists

Because hypotensive effects may be cumulative, it is not recommended that tizanidine be used with other α2-adrenergic agonists [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Introduction

Chronic tension-type headache (CTTH) is a disorder that evolves from episodic tension-type headache, with daily or very frequent episodes of headache lasting minutes to days. It affects 4.1% of the general population in the United States, and is more prevalent in women (up to 65% of cases).

Methods and Objectives

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of drug treatments for chronic tension-type headache? What are the effects of non-drug treatments for chronic tension-type headache? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library and other important databases up to October 2005 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 38 systematic reviews, RCTs or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: acupuncture, amitriptyline, benzodiazepines, botulinum toxin, cognitive behavioural therapy, Indian head massage, mirtazapine, regular acute pain relief medication, relaxation and electromyographic biofeedback, serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressants, and tricyclic antidepressants (other than amitriptyline).

Sumatriptan — adverse events profile indicated generally mild, transient events with dose dependence and inconsistent reporting. Adverse events were transient and mild; however, higher doses of sumatriptan were associated with more AEs. Individual AEs were reported inconsistently among studies, and most studies reported only those occurring in greater than 3% of participants in any treatment arm.

Regarding medical management for medication overuse headache, more specifically with respect to management of withdrawal symptoms, EFNS 2011 guidelines recommend to consider offering corticosteroids (at least 60 mg prednisone or prednisolone) and amitriptyline (up to 50 mg) for the treatment of withdrawal symptoms.

### Tizanidine for chronic cluster headache… [^116yf8nv]. JAMA Network (1996). Excellent credibility.

The treatment of chronic cluster headache is based on a few proven drugs, namely lithium salts, corticosteroids, methysergide maleate, and verapamil hydrochloride. 1 However, some patients do not stop having attacks, despite treatment with 1 or more of these drugs. More recently, transdermal clonidine was proposed as a possible effective and safe treatment. 2 This drug may act by reducing the sharp fluctuations of the sympathetic nervous system occurring during the attacks, 3 by inhibiting the central sympathetic pathway. Tizanidine, an imidazoline derivative, usually used as a central muscle relaxant, is structurally similar to clonidine and seems to act through central α2-receptor agonistic activity. 4 We treated 5 consecutive patients with chronic cluster headache resistant to previous treatments with tizanidine as add-on therapy. Results are summarized in the Table. In 3 patients the attacks ceased and any other treatment was discontinued, in 1 there was a marked reduction.

WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS
-
- ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions were dry mouth, somnolence, asthenia, dizziness, urinary tract infection, constipation, liver function tests abnormal. 1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Tizanidine Tablets, USP is a central alpha-2-adrenergic agonist indicated for the management of spasticity. Because of the short duration of therapeutic effect, treatment with Tizanidine Tablets, USP should be reserved for those daily activities and times when relief of spasticity is most important. required, individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased. These patients should be monitored closely for the onset or increase in severity of the common adverse events as indicators of potential overdose.
