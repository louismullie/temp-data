## Question

Causes secondary to gerd

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the causes secondary to GERD, which I interpret as the complications and extraesophageal manifestations that arise from GERD. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clarifying the terminology so I don't conflate "causes of GERD" with "conditions caused by GERD". Then, I should categorize the complications into esophageal and extraesophageal domains. Next, I will enumerate the major complications within each domain and verify their strength of evidence and prevalence where available. After that, I should consider pathophysiological mechanisms that explain how GERD leads to these complications. Finally, I will integrate guideline-based diagnostic and management implications to ensure clinical relevance and completeness.

> Let me first confirm the terminology so I don't misstate the question. "Causes secondary to GERD" refers to the complications and syndromes that result from chronic reflux of gastric contents into the esophagus and beyond, rather than the etiologies that precipitate GERD itself, and this distinction is consistent with contemporary definitions and classifications of GERD and its syndromes [^d77ce77c] [^a18cade2].

> I will now examine the esophageal complications, starting with mucosal injury. Erosive esophagitis is a direct consequence of acid and pepsin exposure and is graded by severity; its presence establishes objective GERD and is a key endpoint in trials and guidelines, with healing rates far superior on PPIs compared with H2RAs, underscoring causality and clinical significance [^a18cade2] [^400486c0]. Wait, let me verify the progression risk: chronic erosive disease can lead to peptic strictures from fibrosis, causing dysphagia and requiring dilation, which is well described in imaging and clinical reviews and aligns with endoscopic practice patterns for complicated GERD [^0a98257c] [^a18cade2].

> Next, I should review Barrett's esophagus and neoplasia. Chronic reflux drives columnar metaplasia of the distal esophagus, with Barrett's occurring in roughly 10% of chronic GERD patients; this is the strongest known risk factor for esophageal adenocarcinoma, and the relative risk increase is on the order of fivefold in those with frequent symptoms, which reinforces the causal link and the rationale for surveillance in high-risk phenotypes [^a18cade2] [^76f139e8]. Hold on, I should verify that this risk estimate is consistent across sources; yes, multiple high-quality reviews and cohort perspectives converge on this magnitude of association and the need for individualized surveillance strategies [^a18cade2] [^76f139e8].

> I will now consider extraesophageal manifestations, starting with laryngopharyngeal reflux. Chronic cough, laryngitis, and hoarseness are established associations, though causality is heterogeneous and often multifactorial; nonetheless, guidelines advise clinicians to inquire about these symptoms in GERD patients and to use a multidisciplinary approach when evaluating them, reflecting real-world practice and the limits of diagnostic certainty [^8d942ca0] [^a2c91fb7]. Wait, let me verify the strength of evidence: while many patients improve with acid suppression, response is variable and nonacid reflux or vagally mediated reflexes may contribute, so objective testing is reasonable after a failed PPI trial rather than empirically escalating therapy indefinitely [^d250fe41] [^46b61ed4].

> Asthma and pulmonary disease are another major extraesophageal domain. GERD is a recognized trigger or contributor in a subset of patients with asthma, and there is emerging evidence linking GERD to COPD exacerbations, suggesting that reflux may worsen bronchial hyperresponsiveness and inflammatory burden in susceptible patients; however, I should confirm that these are associations with plausible mechanisms rather than universal causality, which is accurate [^8d942ca0] [^3c6b9163]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: routine anti-reflux surgery is not indicated for asthma without objective reflux, so diagnostic confirmation is essential before invasive therapy [^d250fe41].

> Dental erosions are a distinct extraesophageal complication. Acid exposure to oral tissues leads to characteristic enamel loss, particularly on the lingual surfaces, and this is recognized in consensus frameworks as a possible GERD syndrome, reinforcing the need to consider reflux in patients with unexplained dental erosion and to coordinate dental and gastroenterology care [^d77ce77c] [^8d942ca0]. I should double-check that this is not just anecdotal; yes, it is included among established extraesophageal associations in the Montreal classification and contemporary updates [^d77ce77c] [^8d942ca0].

> Let me consider the pathophysiological mechanisms that plausibly link GERD to these complications. Direct mucosal injury from acid and pepsin explains erosive esophagitis and strictures, while chronic injury promotes fibrosis and remodeling; microaspiration of refluxate into the airway can injure laryngeal and pulmonary tissues, and vagally mediated esophago–bronchial reflexes can trigger cough and bronchospasm even without frank aspiration, which helps explain symptom–reflux discordance in some patients [^c42b30b4] [^e053fd90]. I should confirm that these mechanisms are supported by physiologic studies; indeed, translational and clinical work supports both direct and reflex pathways in extraesophageal disease [^c42b30b4] [^e053fd90].

> Next, I should review diagnostic and management implications so the complication framework is clinically actionable. For esophageal complications, endoscopy is appropriate to assess for erosive esophagitis, strictures, and Barrett's, with biopsy when indicated; for extraesophageal symptoms, guidelines recommend evaluating for non-GERD causes first, reserving objective reflux testing for those who fail a PPI trial or who lack typical symptoms, and avoiding endoscopy as a standalone diagnostic for extraesophageal syndromes [^d250fe41] [^0c881c2c]. Hold on, I should verify the role of surgery: antireflux procedures are reserved for patients with objective GERD who remain symptomatic despite optimized therapy, not for those without proven reflux or with multifactorial extraesophageal disease, which is consistently emphasized in multisociety guidance [^d250fe41] [^bb2a345d].

> In summary, the principal complications and manifestations secondary to GERD include esophageal injury such as erosive esophagitis, peptic strictures, Barrett's esophagus, and esophageal adenocarcinoma, as well as extraesophageal syndromes including laryngopharyngeal reflux with chronic cough and laryngitis, asthma and COPD exacerbations, and dental erosions; these arise through direct mucosal injury, microaspiration, and vagally mediated reflexes, and their evaluation should be guided by symptom phenotype, response to therapy, and objective testing when appropriate to avoid overtreatment and to address multifactorial contributors [^a18cade2] [^d250fe41] [^8d942ca0].

GERD causes secondary conditions through chronic reflux of gastric contents, leading to **esophageal complications** (erosive esophagitis, strictures, Barrett's esophagus, and adenocarcinoma) [^a18cade2] and **extraesophageal manifestations** (chronic cough, laryngitis, asthma, dental erosion, and possibly idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis) [^8d942ca0] [^d77ce77c]. These sequelae result from direct mucosal injury, impaired esophageal clearance, and vagally mediated reflexes [^c42b30b4]; risk increases with obesity, hiatal hernia, and persistent acid exposure [^9fc86aff]. Management focuses on acid suppression, lifestyle change, and selective testing; surgery is reserved for refractory cases with objective reflux [^bc369699] [^d250fe41].

---

## Esophageal complications

### Erosive esophagitis

Erosive esophagitis is **mucosal injury from acid and pepsin**, leading to inflammation, ulceration, and bleeding [^a18cade2]. It is graded by severity (Los Angeles classification) and can cause pain, dysphagia, and bleeding [^notfound].

---

### Peptic strictures

Peptic strictures result from **chronic inflammation and fibrosis** that narrow the esophageal lumen, causing progressive dysphagia and food impaction [^0a98257c]. They often require endoscopic dilation and long-term acid suppression [^notfound].

---

### Barrett's esophagus

Barrett's esophagus is **metaplasia of the distal esophageal mucosa** from squamous to columnar epithelium, driven by chronic reflux [^a18cade2]. It is a precursor to esophageal adenocarcinoma, with a risk approximately 0.5% per year [^notfound].

---

### Esophageal adenocarcinoma

Esophageal adenocarcinoma arises from **dysplasia within Barrett's epithelium** and carries a poor prognosis if not detected early [^notfound]. Chronic GERD increases risk fivefold, and surveillance is recommended in high-risk patients [^notfound].

---

## Extraesophageal manifestations

### Respiratory complications

- **Chronic cough**: Reflux-related cough is common and often refractory; mechanisms include microaspiration and vagal reflexes [^e053fd90].

- **Asthma**: GERD can trigger or worsen asthma via aspiration and reflex bronchoconstriction; PPI therapy may help selected patients [^8d942ca0].

- **Laryngitis**: Acid exposure causes laryngeal inflammation, hoarseness, and globus sensation [^8d942ca0].

- **Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis**: An association with GERD is suspected, though causality remains uncertain [^notfound].

---

### Dental complications

Dental erosion results from **acid exposure to tooth enamel**, causing characteristic wear patterns and increased caries risk [^8d942ca0].

---

## Pathophysiological mechanisms

- **Direct mucosal injury**: Acid and pepsin damage esophageal and extraesophageal tissues [^a18cade2].

- **Impaired esophageal clearance**: Delayed clearance prolongs acid contact, worsening injury [^c42b30b4].

- **Vagally mediated reflexes**: Esophageal acid triggers bronchoconstriction and cough [^e053fd90].

- **Hiatal hernia and obesity**: Mechanical disruption of the LES increases reflux severity and complications [^9fc86aff].

---

## Clinical implications and management

- **Acid suppression**: PPIs are first-line to heal esophagitis, prevent complications, and control symptoms [^400486c0].

- **Lifestyle modifications**: Weight loss, head-of-bed elevation, and dietary changes reduce reflux burden [^c2ed778c].

- **Objective testing**: Endoscopy and pH-impedance testing guide diagnosis and management, especially in refractory or extraesophageal cases [^a2a81206].

- **Surgical therapy**: Fundoplication is reserved for patients with objective reflux who fail or cannot tolerate medical therapy [^d16ffa00].

---

GERD leads to significant secondary complications through direct injury and reflex pathways; **early recognition and targeted therapy** are essential to prevent progression and improve outcomes [^a18cade2].

### Endoscopic therapies for gastroesophageal reflux disease [^0725ed1a]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a chronic condition affect-ing over 7% of the US population. The primary objective of therapy is symptom relief, with secondary goals to heal esophagitis, prevent reflux-related complications, and maintain remission. There are several new endoscopic therapies (ETs) for treatment of GERD, generating considerable interest. An outpatient procedure, performed without an incision and general anesthesia, is attractive to patients and these therapies are being rapidly introduced, despite lack of long-term follow-up and randomized trials. In this article, the authors review endoscopic procedures, including technical aspects, mechanisms of action, safety, efficacy, and tolerability. Patient selection and relevant human studies are reviewed to clarify advantages and disadvantages of ET compared with conventional procedures.

### Gastroesophageal reflux disease [^26f64237]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a condition that occurs when reflux of gastric contents into the esophagus causes symptoms and/or complications. The prevalence of GERD in Western societies has been estimated at 30%, making it one of the most commonly encountered disorders in primary care. The spectrum of GERD includes typical symptoms of esophageal reflux (heartburn and/or regurgitation); esophageal injury (erosive esophagitis; stricture; Barrett esophagus; and, rarely, adenocarcinoma); and extraesophageal symptoms, such as hoarseness and chronic cough. Proper diagnosis and treatment of GERD includes symptom control, exclusion of other disorders, avoiding overuse of medications and invasive testing, and minimizing complications.

Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) continues to be among the most common diseases seen by gastroenterologists, surgeons, and primary care physicians. Our understanding of the varied presentations of GERD, enhancements in diagnostic testing, and approach to patient management have evolved. During this time, scrutiny of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) has increased considerably. Although PPIs remain the medical treatment of choice for GERD, multiple publications have raised questions about adverse events, raising doubts about the safety of long-term use and increasing concern about overprescribing of PPIs. New data regarding the potential for surgical and endoscopic interventions have emerged. In this new document, we provide updated, evidence-based recommendations and practical guidance for the evaluation and management of GERD, including pharmacologic, lifestyle, surgical, and endoscopic management. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation system was used to evaluate the evidence and the strength of recommendations. Key concepts and suggestions that as of this writing do not have sufficient evidence to grade are also provided.

Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a common condition around the world. The management of this disease is less than satisfying given complexity of patient presentation and suboptimal diagnostic testing when employed for those poorly responsive to acid suppressive therapy. In this mini review, we discuss some new strategies employed for patients with suspected GERD to better understand disease pathophysiology. We compare the strategies and outline a clinically relevant approach in this difficult group of patients.

### The Montreal definition and classification of gastroesophageal reflux disease: a global evidence-based consensus [^d77ce77c]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2006). Low credibility.

Objectives

A globally acceptable definition and classification of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is desirable for research and clinical practice. The aim of this initiative was to develop a consensus definition and classification that would be useful for patients, physicians, and regulatory agencies.

Methods

A modified Delphi process was employed to reach consensus using repeated iterative voting. A series of statements was developed by a working group of five experts after a systematic review of the literature in three databases (Embase, Cochrane trials register, Medline). Over a period of 2 yr, the statements were developed, modified, and approved through four rounds of voting. The voting group consisted of 44 experts from 18 countries. The final vote was conducted on a 6-point scale and consensus was defined a priori as agreement by two-thirds of the participants.

Results

The level of agreement strengthened throughout the process with two-thirds of the participants agreeing with 86%, 88%, 94%, and 100% of statements at each vote, respectively. At the final vote, 94% of the final 51 statements were approved by 90% of the Consensus Group, and 90% of statements were accepted with strong agreement or minor reservation. GERD was defined as a condition that develops when the reflux of stomach contents causes troublesome symptoms and/or complications. The disease was subclassified into esophageal and extraesophageal syndromes. Novel aspects of the new definition include a patient-centered approach that is independent of endoscopic findings, subclassification of the disease into discrete syndromes, and the recognition of laryngitis, cough, asthma, and dental erosions as possible GERD syndromes. It also proposes a new definition for suspected and proven Barrett's esophagus.

Conclusions

Evidence-based global consensus definitions are possible despite differences in terminology and language, prevalence, and manifestations of the disease in different countries. A global consensus definition for GERD may simplify disease management, allow collaborative research, and make studies more generalizable, assisting patients, physicians, and regulatory agencies.

### Gastroesophageal reflux disease [^a18cade2]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2022). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on gastroesophageal reflux disease:

- **Definition**: GERD is a chronic condition in which the reflux of gastric contents into the esophagus causes symptoms such as heartburn and regurgitation or results in complications including esophagitis, stricture, or Barrett's esophagus. Diagnosis is based on typical symptoms, endoscopic findings of mucosal injury, or abnormal esophageal acid exposure on reflux testing.
- **Pathophysiology**: GERD results from dysfunction of the antireflux barrier at the GEJ, including transient lower esophageal sphincter relaxations, hypotensive lower esophageal sphincter tone, and impaired diaphragmatic support. Additional factors such as delayed gastric emptying, reduced salivary neutralization, and impaired esophageal clearance contribute to prolonged acid exposure. Refluxed gastric acid and pepsin cause mucosal inflammation, cytokine release, and damage that may progress to erosive esophagitis or metaplasia.
- **Epidemiology**: The estimated prevalence of GERD symptoms in the US ranges from 6% to 30%, with a weekly prevalence of symptoms approaching 20%.
- **Disease course**: Typical manifestations include heartburn, regurgitation, and chest discomfort, with possible progression to dysphagia or bleeding in severe cases. Many patients experience intermittent symptoms that respond to lifestyle modification and PPIs, while a subset develops chronic or refractory disease requiring diagnostic evaluation and long-term therapy. Complications include erosive esophagitis, peptic stricture, and Barrett's esophagus.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of GERD is generally favorable with effective management. Most patients achieve symptom control with PPIs or lifestyle measures, though relapse is common when therapy is withdrawn. Severe erosive disease or Barrett's esophagus warrants indefinite acid suppression or surgical therapy. Barrett's esophagus occurs in about 10% of patients with chronic GERD. Long-term outcomes are excellent with adherence to treatment, and while complications can occur, GERD rarely progresses to life-threatening disease when managed appropriately.

### The many manifestations of gastroesophageal reflux disease: presentation, evaluation, and treatment [^98331698]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a common problem that is expensive to diagnose and treat. The disease is increasing in prevalence in the Western world, with important risk factors being obesity and the eradication of Helicobacter pylori. Heartburn and acid regurgitation are classic symptoms of GERD, but their sensitivity is poor. Ambulatory esophageal pH testing is the most sensitive test for GERD, whereas endoscopy is the most specific test. Medical treatment with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) has revolutionized the treatment of GERD and its complications, but long-term side effects do exist. Laparoscopic anti-reflux surgery and PPIs have similar efficacy in the few available long-term trials. This article reviews the presentation, evaluation, and treatment of GERD.

### American Gastroenterological Association medical position statement on the management of gastroesophageal reflux disease [^56a4f49a]. Gastroenterology (2008). Medium credibility.

American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) medical position statement — operational definition and classification of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD): There can be no criterion standard definition of GERD because the threshold distinction between physiologic reflux and reflux disease is ultimately arbitrary, and hence these questions can only be answered by opinion (USPSTF grade not applicable). The Montreal definition was adopted in the technical review as a suitable framework; it defined GERD as "a condition which develops when the reflux of stomach contents causes troublesome symptoms and/or complications," with symptoms considered "troublesome" if they adversely affect an individual's well-being. Esophageal GERD syndromes are categorized as those that are symptom based and those that are defined by tissue injury, while extraesophageal syndromes are classified as established or proposed association with GERD, acknowledging that in some circumstances we cannot establish causation. A distinguishing feature of the Montreal definition is that it does not use the term "nonerosive reflux disease" but rather subdivides esophageal syndromes into symptomatic syndromes and syndromes with esophageal injury; hence, functional heartburn does not fit the Montreal definition of GERD, whereas it is included under the umbrella of nonerosive reflux disease. The distinction between GERD and episodic heartburn in the Montreal definition is in the word "troublesome," and in the absence of esophageal injury, heartburn symptoms of insufficient frequency or severity to be perceived as troublesome by the patient (after assurance of their benign nature) do not meet the Montreal definition of a symptomatic esophageal GERD syndrome.

### Presentation and epidemiology of gastroesophageal reflux Disease [^137ffbb9]. Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is the most prevalent gastrointestinal disorder in the United States, and leads to substantial morbidity, though associated mortality is rare. The prevalence of GERD symptoms appeared to increase until 1999. Risk factors for complications of GERD include advanced age, male sex, white race, abdominal obesity, and tobacco use. Most patients with GERD present with heartburn and effortless regurgitation. Coexistent dysphagia is considered an alarm symptom, prompting evaluation. There is substantial overlap between symptoms of GERD and those of eosinophilic esophagitis, functional dyspepsia, and gastroparesis, posing a challenge for patient management.

Regarding specific circumstances for gastroesophageal reflux disease, more specifically with respect to pediatric patients (upper gastrointestinal endoscopy), ESPGHAN/NASPGHAN 2018 guidelines recommend to consider performing upper gastrointestinal endoscopy with biopsies to assess complications of GERD in patients with a suspected underlying mucosal disease or before escalating treatment.

### Role of multimodality imaging in gastroesophageal reflux disease and its complications, with clinical and pathologic correlation [^0a98257c]. Radiographics (2020). Medium credibility.

Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a common condition and impairs the quality of life for millions of patients, accounts for considerable health care spending, and is a primary risk factor for esophageal adenocarcinoma. There have been substantial advances in understanding the pathogenesis of GERD and its complications and much progress in diagnosis and management of GERD; however, these have not been comprehensively discussed in the recent radiology literature. Understanding the role of imaging in GERD and its complications is important to aid in multidisciplinary treatment of GERD. GERD results from prolonged or recurrent reflux of gastric contents into the esophagus. Common symptoms include heartburn or regurgitation. Prolonged reflux of gastric contents into the esophagus can cause erosive esophagitis. Over time, the inflammatory response related to esophagitis can lead to deposition of fibrous tissue and development of strictures. Alternatively, the esophageal mucosa can undergo metaplasia (Barrett esophagus), a precursor to dysplasia (which can lead to adenocarcinoma). Conventional barium esophagography has long been considered the primary imaging modality for the esophagus, and the fluoroscopic findings for diagnosis of GERD have been well established. Multimodality imaging has a clear role in detection and assessment of the complications of GERD, specifically reflux esophagitis and Barrett esophagus; differentiation of benign and malignant strictures; and detection, staging, and posttreatment surveillance of esophageal adenocarcinoma. Given the dramatic changes in utilization of abdominal imaging during the past 2 decades, with significantly declining volume of fluoroscopic procedures and concomitant increase in CT and MRI studies, it is crucial that modern radiologists appreciate the value of barium esophagography in the workup of GERD and recognize the key imaging features of GERD and its complications at CT and MRI.

Regarding specific circumstances for gastroesophageal reflux disease, more specifically with respect to pediatric patients (indications for antireflux surgery), ESPGHAN/NASPGHAN 2018 guidelines recommend to consider performing antireflux surgery, including fundoplication, in infant and pediatric patients with GERD with any of the following:

- life-threatening complications (such as cardiorespiratory failure) of GERD after failure of optimal medical treatment

- symptoms refractory to optimal therapy, after appropriate evaluation excluding other underlying diseases

- chronic conditions (neurologically impaired, cystic fibrosis) with a significant risk of GERD-related complications

- the need for chronic pharmacotherapy to control signs and/or symptoms of GERD.

### Revisiting Montreal: new insights into symptoms and their causes, and implications for the future of GERD [^6e563e4a]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

The primary goal of this review was to revisit the concept of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). The previously variable definition of GERD was finally standardized in 2006 with the Montreal Consensus, which states that GERD is "a condition that develops when the reflux of stomach contents into the esophagus causes troublesome symptoms and/or complications". The Montreal Definition of GERD encapsulates most eventualities, from patients with reflux esophagitis with or without symptoms (the latter actually accounting for close to 40% of such patients in Western populations, and possibly a much higher proportion in Asian populations) to those with symptoms but no other findings. The latter, purely symptom-based definition of GERD provided a rationale for treatment with acid-suppressive medications without the need for cumbersome investigations of symptom etiology, thus enhancing management of the substantial symptom burden in these patients. The Montreal Definition also acknowledges that reflux contents other than acid can cause symptoms. However, the degree of the complexity of the relationship between symptoms and reflux was perhaps not fully appreciated at the time of its development. The situation has been further complicated by the subsequent, comprehensive categorization of a range of functional esophageal disorders that are indistinguishable from GERD without substantial investigation. As part of our revisiting the concept of GERD, we recap our current understanding of the relationship between suspected GERD symptoms and reflux (or lack thereof), with a focus on the persisting clinical challenge and possible mechanisms of reflux hypersensitivity and functional heartburn. Finally, we discuss the implications of these findings for our current assumptions about suspected GERD symptoms, including whether treating GERD as a composite disease entity may now be a barrier to more precise patient management.

### Extraesophageal symptoms: what role for the proton pump inhibitors? [^9df1e76e]. The American Journal of Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

The esophageal complications of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) are well described and include erosive esophagitis, stricture, Barrett esophagus, and adenocarcinoma. Primary care physicians often encounter patients with "extraesophageal" manifestations of GERD in the absence of heartburn. Patients may present with symptoms involving the pulmonary system, noncardiac chest pain, and ear, nose, and throat disorders. The diagnosis of reflux disease in these individuals may be challenging because, in addition to the absence of heartburn, endoscopy is often negative. Laryngoscopy and 24-hour dual-channel intraesophageal pH-metry may have greater diagnostic yields, but they are costly, invasive, and time-consuming. A trial of proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy is increasingly being considered a first-line diagnostic test in those with suspected reflux-related extraesophageal symptoms. The duration as well as dose of PPI should be based on the presenting symptoms, with patients having pulmonary manifestations often requiring twice-daily therapy for 2 to 3 months. In contrast, symptoms of reflux-related noncardiac chest pain may be relieved with a 1-week, standard-dose treatment trial. Patients who fail to experience symptom resolution or improvement should undergo further diagnostic evaluations including 24-hour esophageal pH studies while continuing their PPI therapy to establish persistent versus absent acid reflux. The role of fundoplication or other surgical/laparoscopic procedures in these patients has yet to be determined.

### Management of severe gastroesophageal reflux disease [^2485b2e3]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2001). Low credibility.

Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) affects more than one third of the population. It is generally a chronic condition and has the potential to be serious. Some patients with GERD experience persistent daytime or nighttime heartburn and some sustain severe damage, including ulceration, stricture, and Barrett's esophagus, which can predispose to development of adenocarcinoma. Extraesophageal manifestations of GERD can include otolaryngologic, respiratory, and cardiac problems. Severe GERD responds best to agents that suppress gastric acid secretion. Of these, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) provide the most effective control of gastric acidity and are, therefore, the medical treatment of choice. In fact, nonresponse to a PPI should raise the suspicion that the diagnosis is not GERD. Proton pump inhibitors are quickly becoming the treatment of choice for GERD, especially for severe or refractory cases. For patients whose GERD is refractory even to PPIs or who are unwilling to face years of PPI therapy, antireflux surgery remains an option.

### Advances in the diagnosis and management of gastroesophageal reflux disease [^647905b8]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a multifaceted disorder encompassing a family of syndromes attributable to, or exacerbated by, gastroesophageal reflux that impart morbidity, mainly through troublesome symptoms. Major GERD phenotypes are non-erosive reflux disease, GERD hypersensitivity, low or high grade esophagitis, Barrett's esophagus, reflux chest pain, laryngopharyngeal reflux, and regurgitation dominant reflux. GERD is common throughout the world, and its epidemiology is linked to the Western lifestyle, obesity, and the demise of Helicobacter pylori. Because of its prevalence and chronicity, GERD is a substantial economic burden measured in physician visits, diagnostics, cancer surveillance protocols, and therapeutics. An individual with typical symptoms has a fivefold risk of developing esophageal adenocarcinoma, but mortality from GERD is otherwise rare. The principles of management are to provide symptomatic relief and to minimize potential health risks through some combination of lifestyle modifications, diagnostic testing, pharmaceuticals (mainly to suppress or counteract gastric acid secretion), and surgery. However, it is usually a chronic recurring condition and management needs to be personalized to each case. While escalating proton pump inhibitor therapy may be pertinent to healing high grade esophagitis, its applicability to other GERD phenotypes wherein the modulating effects of anxiety, motility, hypersensitivity, and non-esophageal factors may dominate is highly questionable.

### Multi-society consensus conference and guideline on the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) [^bf7ba058]. Surgical Endoscopy (2023). High credibility.

Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) — MSA versus proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy: The panel suggests that adult patients with GERD may benefit from MSA over continued PPI use. (Conditional recommendation based on moderate certainty of evidence). From 74 studies there was a single randomized control trial that guided the panel for decision making; this single study included 158 patients that were followed for one year, and no observational studies met inclusion criteria. Reported benefits included patient reported complete reflux symptom resolution less than 2 years with an absolute difference 795 more patients per 1,000 (95% CI 393 to 1, 524 more) in 1 RCT of 148 participants, reduced need for PPI with an absolute difference 910 fewer patients per 1,000 (95% CI 960 fewer – 770 fewer) in 1 RCT of 134 participants, greater patient satisfaction with an absolute difference 786 more patients per 1,000 (95% CI 181 more to 3,181 more) in 1 RCT of 134 participants, and objective reflux recurrence at 6 months with an absolute difference 38 fewer patients per 1,000 (95% CI 140 fewer to 131 more) in 1 RCT of 158 participants. No undesirable effects were available for this comparison; thus, the magnitude of effect is unknown, and there was not informative data for QoL, patient reported symptom recurrence, dysphagia, hiatal hernia recurrence, complications, mortality, re-operation rates, and cost.

### Efficacy of nonpharmacological interventions and combination with pharmacological interventions for gastroesophageal reflux disease: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^98f7a843]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is characterized by troublesome symptoms or specific complications caused by the reflux of gastric content. Heartburn and acid regurgitation are typical symptoms of GERD, and they are present across all three phenotypes of the condition. In addition to the typical symptoms, GERD is accompanied by various intraesophageal and extraesophageal complications. Dysphagia, reflux-induced esophageal stricture, and esophageal ulcers are common intraesophageal complications. Barrett's esophagus and esophageal adenocarcinoma are severe complications of GERD.

The pathogenesis of GERD is closely associated with the impairment of the antireflux barrier function. The lower esophageal sphincter (LES) is the primary barrier against reflux, and transient lower esophageal sphincter relaxations (TLESRs) are the main pathogenic mechanism of GERD.TLESRs contribute to acid reflux, while impaired peristalsis delays esophageal clearance, thereby increasing the duration of esophageal acid exposure. In addition, 8% to 20% of patients with GERD have concurrent gastroparesis, and delayed gastric emptying leads to an increased gastric pressure gradient, which can also cause TLESRs resulting in GERD. Obesity, NSAID use, smoking, and age over 50 are risk factors for GERD, which directly or indirectly compromising the integrity of the antireflux barrier and increasing the risk of its development.

### Physiology and pathogenesis of gastroesophageal reflux disease [^f1f39d8f]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is one of the most common problems treated by primary care physicians. Almost 20% of the population in the United States experiences occasional regurgitation, heartburn, or retrosternal pain because of GERD. Reflux disease is complex, and the physiology and pathogenesis are still incompletely understood. However, abnormalities of any one or a combination of the three physiologic processes, namely, esophageal motility, lower esophageal sphincter function, and gastric motility or emptying, can lead to GERD. There are many diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to GERD today, but more studies are needed to better understand this complex disease process.

### GERD or not GERD: the fussy infant [^1151b252]. Journal of Perinatology (2009). Low credibility.

A global evidence-based consensus has defined gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) as 'a condition, which develops when the reflux of stomach contents causes troublesome symptoms and/or complications'.The manifestations of GERD can be divided into esophageal and extraesophageal syndromes, and include vomiting, poor weight gain, dysphagia, abdominal or substernal/retrosternal pain, esophagitis and respiratory disorders. The extraesophageal syndromes have been divided into established and proposed associations: established would include cough, laryngitis, asthma and dental erosion ascribable to reflux, whereas proposed associations would include pharyngitis, sinusitis, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and recurrent otitis media. Uninvestigated patients with esophageal symptoms without evidence of esophageal injury would be considered to have asymptomatic esophageal syndromes, whereas those with demonstrable injury are considered to have esophageal syndromes with esophageal injury. Therefore, this allows symptoms to define the disease but permits further characterization if mucosal injury is found. Within the syndromes with associated injury are reflux esophagitis, stricture, Barrett's esophagitis and adenocarcinoma. This review will address definitions of GER and GERD-associated symptoms and treatment options.

### Pathophysiology of gastroesophageal reflux disease [^c42b30b4]. Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

The pathogenesis of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is complex and involves changes in reflux exposure, epithelial resistance, and visceral sensitivity. The gastric refluxate is a noxious material that injures the esophagus and elicits symptoms. Esophageal exposure to gastric refluxate is the primary determinant of disease severity. This exposure arises via compromise of the anti-reflux barrier and reduced ability of the esophagus to clear and buffer the refluxate, leading to reflux disease. However, complications and symptoms also occur in the context of normal reflux burden, when there is either poor epithelial resistance or increased visceral sensitivity. Reflux therefore develops via alterations in the balance of aggressive and defensive forces.

Algorithm for suspected extraesophageal reflux disease with concurrent typical symptoms — Patients with extraesophageal reflux symptoms with typical GERD sx are managed with Twice daily PPI therapy for 8–12 weeks. If symptoms resolve, Treat accordingly and Lower PPI to lowest effective dose**, with the note **Consider endoscopy and reflux monitoring to support long-term use of PPI. If symptoms persist, Endoscopy* is performed and, if negative, Ambulatory reflux monitoring off-PPI follows. The figure footnote states *Look for evidence of GERD-related injury or complications and rule out alternative esophageal diseases. The narrative adds that An empiric PPI trial can be considered in patients with extraesophageal and concurrent typical reflux symptoms, whereas early reflux testing should be considered in those with extraesophageal symptoms alone, and To avoid long-term PPI use or a placebo effect, patients responsive to a trial of PPI should be titrated to the lowest effective dose and should be considered for off-therapy endoscopy or reflux testing.

Treatment goals and lifestyle modification in reflux disease — the goals are to relieve symptoms, heal esophagitis, and prevent recurrence of symptoms and future complications; options include lifestyle modification, medical therapy, endoscopic antireflux procedures, and surgical interventions, but endoscopic antireflux procedures are not discussed given limited available data in those with extraesophageal reflux. Lifestyle modification is described as important yet supported by limited high-quality evidence, with systematic reviews indicating lack of or weak evidence that cessation of tobacco, alcohol, chocolate, caffeine or coffee, citrus, mint, or spicy food improves symptoms or physiological reflux and lack of evidence that carbonated beverages cause GERD; there is evidence that reducing weight is effective, and it is established that weight gain results in GERD symptoms and complications and that weight loss reduces reflux symptoms.

### Symptomatic reflux disease: the present, the past and the future [^9fc86aff]. Gut (2014). Low credibility.

The worldwide incidence of GORD and its complications is increasing along with the exponentially increasing problem of obesity. Of particular concern is the relationship between central adiposity and GORD complications, including oesophageal adenocarcinoma. Driven by progressive insight into the epidemiology and pathophysiology of GORD, the earlier belief that increased gastroesophageal reflux mainly results from one dominant mechanism has been replaced by acceptance that GORD is multifactorial. Instigating factors, such as obesity, age, genetics, pregnancy and trauma may all contribute to mechanical impairment of the oesophagogastric junction resulting in pathological reflux and accompanying syndromes. Progression of the disease by exacerbating and perpetuating factors such as obesity, neuromuscular dysfunction and oesophageal fibrosis ultimately lead to development of an overt hiatal hernia. The latter is now accepted as a central player, impacting on most mechanisms underlying gastroesophageal reflux (low sphincter pressure, transient lower oesophageal sphincter relaxation, oesophageal clearance and acid pocket position), explaining its association with more severe disease and mucosal damage. Since the introduction of proton pump inhibitors (PPI), clinical management of GORD has markedly changed, shifting the therapeutic challenge from mucosal healing to reduction of PPI-resistant symptoms. In parallel, it became clear that reflux symptoms may result from weakly acidic or non-acid reflux, insight that has triggered the search for new compounds or minimally invasive procedures to reduce all types of reflux. In summary, our view on GORD has evolved enormously compared to that of the past, and without doubt will impact on how to deal with GORD in the future.

Esophageal GERD syndromes — Diagnostic testing is invoked in 3 broad scenarios: to avert misdiagnosis, to identify complications of reflux disease, and in the evaluation of empirical treatment failures; in the endoscopic evaluation of dysphagia the endoscopist should have a low threshold for obtaining multiple biopsies, preferably at least 5, to evaluate for eosinophilic esophagitis; for troublesome symptoms not adequately responsive to empirical twice-daily PPI therapy, endoscopy is again the first diagnostic test to consider, followed after a normal endoscopy by esophageal manometry and then by ascertaining whether there is excessive esophageal acid exposure when PPI therapy is withheld; high-quality evidence supporting the broad utility of alarm features as a diagnostic tool is quite limited, but individual alarm features with the best performance include weight loss, dysphagia, and epigastric mass on examination.

### Gastroesophageal reflux disease [^d6b0862a]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2002). Low credibility.

Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) affects many patients and has a negative effect on quality of life. Along with the increasing prevalence of GERD is an increase in GERD-related complications, including Barrett esophagus and esophageal adenocarcinoma. The past year has yielded new insights into the pathophysiology of GERD that can help us to better understand the relationship between reflux episodes and symptoms of mucosal damage and to provide a tailored treatment targeting individual pathophysiologic defects. The issues addressed in this report include gastric secretory and motor dysfunction; failure of the antireflux barrier caused by hiatal hernia and transient lower esophageal sphincter relaxations; characterization of the refluxate, particularly of nonacid reflux; prevalence and prognostic value of esophageal dysmotility in GERD; presence and eradication of Helicobacter pylori; Barrett esophagus and extraesophageal manifestations of GERD; and, finally, advances in medical, endoscopic, and surgical treatments of GERD.

What is GORD?

Parallel with the introduction of PPIs came an improved understanding of the full clinical spectrum of GORD. Whereas in the past, clinicians had struggled to manage reflux oesophagitis, ulcers and recurrent strictures with antacids and histamine-2 receptor antagonists, these problems quickly succumbed to the potent acid suppression made possible with PPIs. In fact, with rare exception, it became widely accepted that the mucosal manifestations of GORD (other than Barrett's metaplasia) can be controlled indefinitely with sustained PPI therapy. However, as the problem of refractory mucosal disease receded, the problem of refractory symptoms blossomed and the list of symptoms and syndromes potentially attributable to GORD expanded. These developments prompted the formation of an international consensus conference, ultimately resulting in the 'Montreal definition' of GORD. The proposed overarching definition of GORD was 'a condition which develops when the reflux of stomach contents causes troublesome symptoms and/or complications'.

The Montreal definition was evolutionary in that there had really been no prior attempt at developing a unifying concept of what constituted GORD. Neither the clinical spectrum of the disorder(s) nor the defining features of the 'disease' had ever been clearly articulated. The consensus document went on to explore the relationships between erosive and non-erosive disease, oesophageal and extra-oesophageal manifestations, and to review health-related quality-of-life data pertinent to reflux symptoms in order to define the term 'troublesome'. With regard to the latter, no threshold values for symptom severity could be proposed for any potential reflux symptoms other than heartburn, because no relevant data could be found in the literature. Subsequently, a threshold for severity has also been developed for the symptom of regurgitation based on analysis of an extensive quality-of-life dataset. Nonetheless, the concept of 'refractory GORD' shifted from one of persistent mucosal disease to one of potential GORD symptoms not eliminated with PPI therapy. Not surprisingly, the other development that ensued with adoption of the Montreal definition of GORD was that potential GORD symptoms refractory to acid-suppressive therapy emerged as one of the most common reasons for gastroenterological consultations in the USA and western Europe.

Summary

Worldwide, the incidence of GORD and its complications (EO, BO and OAC) is increasing, a worrisome observation coinciding with the exponentially increasing problem of obesity. Of great interest is the recently appreciated relationship between central adiposity and GORD, potentially explaining the increased risk in white males to develop complications, including OAC. Mainly driven by progressive insight in the epidemiology and pathophysiology of GORD, the earlier belief that increased gastroesophageal reflux mainly results from one dominant mechanism is now replaced by the acceptance that GORD is a multifactorial disease. As summarised in figure 3, instigating factors such as obesity, age, genetics, pregnancy and trauma may all contribute to mechanical impairment of the OGJ resulting in pathological reflux and accompanying syndromes. Progression of the disease by exacerbating and perpetuating factors such as obesity, neuromuscular dysfunction and oesophageal fibrosis ultimately lead to the development of an overt hiatal hernia. The latter is now accepted as a central player, impacting on most of the mechanisms underlying gastroesophageal reflux (low LOS sphincter pressure, TLOSRs, oesophageal clearance, and acid pocket position), explaining its association with more severe disease and mucosal damage. Since the introduction of PPIs, clinical management of GORD has changed dramatically, shifting the therapeutic challenge from mucosal healing to reduction of PPI-resistant symptoms. In parallel, it became clear that reflux symptoms may result from weakly acidic or non-acid reflux, insight that has triggered the search for new compounds or minimally invasive procedures to reduce all types of reflux. In summary, our view on GORD has evolved enormously compared to that of the past, and without doubt will impact on how to deal with GORD in the future.

### Is gastroesophageal reflux disease really a life-long disease: do babies who regurgitate grow up to be adults with GERD complications? [^3b40d2cb]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2006). Low credibility.

There are a number of chronic digestive diseases in adults which have symptom and/or disease onset in childhood. Examples of childhood-onset chronic diseases include Helicobacter pylori-associated gastroduodenal disease and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Unfortunately, there is a paucity of well-designed longitudinal studies that characterize the natural history of each of these conditions and more importantly identify individuals (i.e., children) who are at risk for serious, long-term adult sequelae. Gastroesophageal reflux (GER), the physiological condition, and GERD, the disease, occur frequently during the first 2 yr of life. However, commonly held "dogma" by pediatricians is the belief that the majority of these children "grew out of their GER or GERD symptoms". On the contrary, recent evidence suggests that GERD in some subjects is a chronic, potentially life-long condition that begins in childhood, and in those in whom disease onset is early, there may be a higher risk for long-term severe disease sequelae. The article by Orenstein et al., although small in cohort size (N = 19), is the first systematic, longitudinal prospective study that employs both a validated GERD symptom assessment instrument and a histological characterization of esophageal inflammation via mucosal biopsies of infants during the first year of life. The infants, part of a larger therapeutic trial, were originally referred to the investigators for GERD evaluation, failed a 2-wk lifestyle modification trial, and were randomized to placebo or intervention (acid suppression and prokinetic therapy). This placebo cohort was evaluated in follow-up via assessment of symptoms using a validated Infant-Gastroesophageal-Reflux-Questionnaire (I-GERQ) and esophageal suction biopsy; morphometric characterization of mucosal histology and symptom scores were performed at 2, 4, 6, and 12 months. At the 12-month endpoint, 10 of 19 completed the study without rescue medication and overall symptom scores improved in all 10 completers. However, none of the 10 completers had normalization of biopsy assessments, i.e., basal cell layer < 25% and papillary height < 53% of epithelial thickness. The authors concluded that although symptoms improved in more than half of infants with reflux esophagitis followed longitudinally, esophageal mucosal histology remained abnormal at the 1-yr evaluation in the absence of pharmacotherapy. The lack of concordant improvement of the esophageal histology should raise concern regarding sub-clinical persistence of ongoing esophageal insult, which might in the long-term, predispose the individual to GERD-related complications, such as strictures, Barrett's esophagus, and/or esophageal adenocarcinoma. In this editorial, the implications of GERD being a life-long disease based on the findings described by Orenstein et al. are discussed. In addition, a description of areas where further research is critically needed is provided namely: (1) population-based, epidemiological studies of GERD with appropriate case and control definitions, (2) characterization of genetically "at-risk" individuals (i.e., with childhood-onset GERD) for severe GERD sequelae (e.g. Barrett's esophagus, esophageal adenocarcinoma), or potentially, (3) longitudinal, family cohort natural history studies with index pediatric GERD cases.

### How would you manage this patient with gastroesophageal reflux symptoms? Grand rounds discussion from beth Israel deaconess medical center [^71259dcf]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a common medical condition presenting with heartburn, regurgitation, cough, hoarseness, and/or wheezing. Patients with classic GERD symptoms often do not require diagnostic studies before empirical treatment is initiated. However, if atypical features are present, including alarm symptoms for malignancy, or if symptoms do not respond to conventional treatment, upper endoscopy may be necessary. The optimal management of GERD, which is the subject of debate, depends on the frequency and severity of symptoms. In 2021, the American College of Gastroenterology published updated recommendations for diagnosis and management of GERD. In addition to histamine-2 receptor antagonist or proton-pump inhibitor therapy, which may be prescribed as needed or continuously, lifestyle and dietary modification are often advised. Here, 2 physicians, a primary care practitioner and a gastroenterologist, debate how to manage a patient with GERD symptoms. They discuss the diagnosis of this condition, its initial management, indications for upper endoscopy, and how to care for the patient whose condition does not respond to empirical therapy.

Description

The purpose of this American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) Institute Clinical Practice Update is to review the available evidence and expert advice regarding the clinical management of patients with suspected extraesophageal gastroesophageal reflux disease.

Methods

This article provides practical advice based on the available published evidence including that identified from recently published reviews from leading investigators in the field, prospective and population studies, clinical trials, and recent clinical guidelines and technical reviews. This best practice document is not based on a formal systematic review. The best practice advice as presented in this document applies to patients with symptoms or conditions suspected to be related to extraesophageal reflux (EER). This expert review was commissioned and approved by the AGA Institute Clinical Practice Updates Committee (CPUC) and the AGA Governing Board to provide timely guidance on a topic of high clinical importance to the AGA membership and underwent internal peer review by the CPUC and external peer review through standard procedures of Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology. These Best Practice Advice (BPA) statements were drawn from a review of the published literature and from expert opinion. Because systematic reviews were not performed, these BPA statements do not carry formal ratings of the quality of evidence or strength of the presented considerations. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 1: Gastroenterologists should be aware of potential extraesophageal manifestations of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and should inquire about such disorders including laryngitis, chronic cough, asthma, and dental erosions in GERD patients to determine whether GERD may be a contributing factor to these conditions. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 2: Development of a multidisciplinary approach to extraesophageal (EER) manifestations is an important consideration because the conditions are often multifactorial, requiring input from non-gastroenterology (GI) specialties. Results from diagnostic testing (ie, bronchoscopy, thoracic imaging, laryngoscopy, etc) from non-GI disciplines should be taken into consideration when gastroesophageal reflux (GER) is considered as a cause for extraesophageal symptoms. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 3: Currently, there is no single diagnostic tool that can conclusively identify GER as the cause of EER symptoms. Determination of the contribution of GER to EER symptoms should be based on the global clinical impression derived from patients' symptoms, response to GER therapy, and results of endoscopy and reflux testing. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 4: Consideration should be given toward diagnostic testing for reflux before initiation of proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy in patients with potential extraesophageal manifestations of GERD, but without typical GERD symptoms. Initial single-dose PPI trial, titrating up to twice daily in those with typical GERD symptoms, is reasonable. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 5: Symptom improvement of EER manifestations while on PPI therapy may result from mechanisms of action other than acid suppression and should not be regarded as confirmation for GERD. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 6: In patients with suspected extraesophageal manifestation of GERD who have failed one trial (up to 12 weeks) of PPI therapy, one should consider objective testing for pathologic GER, because additional trials of different PPIs are low yield. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 7: Initial testing to evaluate for reflux should be tailored to patients' clinical presentation and can include upper endoscopy and ambulatory reflux monitoring studies of acid suppressive therapy. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 8: Testing can be considered for those with an established objective diagnosis of GERD who do not respond to high doses of acid suppression. Testing can include pH-impedance monitoring while on acid suppression to evaluate the role of ongoing acid or non-acid reflux. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 9: Alternative treatment methods to acid suppressive therapy (eg, lifestyle modifications, alginate-containing antacids, external upper esophageal sphincter compression device, cognitive-behavioral therapy, neuromodulators) may serve a role in management of EER symptoms. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 10: Shared decision-making should be performed before referral for anti-reflux surgery for EER when the patient has clear, objectively defined evidence of GERD. However, a lack of response to PPI therapy predicts lack of response to anti-reflux surgery and should be incorporated into the decision process.

Decision criteria and additional considerations — partial versus complete fundoplication in gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) reflect that "The certainty of data for these effects was deemed moderate," and that consensus is "based on the demonstrated decreased post-operative side effects after partial fundoplication compared to the limited differences in long-term reflux control, both of which are supported with moderate strength evidence." Generalizability and heterogeneity are addressed because "many of the participating surgeons in these studies practiced at academic, tertiary care centers," and "the pooled studies included several different types of partial fundoplications," yet "this did not appear to translate into any heterogeneity within the outcomes," while "the observational studies included in the systematic review supported the RCT findings." Patient-centered factors include that "Many patients' primary complaint is related to heartburn," balanced against a "desire to avoid dysphagia and other side effects associated with a complete fundoplication, including long-term gas bloat symptoms," such that "These patients may be more satisfied with a partial fundoplication." Special consideration is described for patients "with objective findings of severe GERD (such as Barrett's esophagus, dysplasia, or severe esophagitis) or those who are post lung transplantation who may value objective GERD resolution in order to prevent progression of their esophageal or lung disease (e.g., graft failure) over fear of postoperative dysphagia, gas bloat, and inability to vomit."

### Gastroesophageal reflux disease: then and now [^29a9b47f]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2004). Low credibility.

Although Galen first described esophagitis almost 2000 years ago, its relation to acid was only recognized in the 19th century by Rokitansky. Considerably more interest in the symptoms and complications of esophagitis has been evident over the last century, as gastroesophageal reflux disease displaced peptic ulceration and became the principal acid-related disease of our times. Of particular interest has been the recognition of the clinical significance of the previously overlooked extraesophageal manifestations of the disease such as laryngitis, asthma, and sleep disturbance. The evolution of highly effective medical therapy has over the last decade drastically reduced the need for surgical intervention for control of symptoms except under select conditions, especially volume-related reflux and children with refractory symptoms. The proton pump inhibitor class of drugs is indisputably the most effective overall form of management, while individual proton pump inhibitors appear to be equivalent in their efficacy. Issues that remain to be resolved include the management of nonerosive gastroesophageal reflux disease, the long-term dependence of many patients on acid-suppressing medication, and the recognition of atypical manifestations and rare but serious complications of gastroesophageal reflux disease. In this respect, Barrett's esophagus still presents a major biologic and management conundrum for the physicians and scientists alike.

Esophagogastroduodenoscopy — initial evaluation and limitations for extraesophageal reflux (EER): Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) is typically the initial diagnostic test for esophageal symptoms, particularly with alarm symptoms or lack of treatment response, and is ideally performed after holding proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy for 2–4 weeks to increase diagnostic yield for esophagitis; it evaluates objective mucosal abnormalities, contributing factors, and excludes alternate diagnoses. Objective gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) findings including erosive esophagitis (Los Angeles grades B, C, D) or long-segment Barrett's esophagus are considered highly specific for GERD, yet EGD in the majority of patients with GERD will be normal and EGD findings do not confirm that extraesophageal symptoms are caused by reflux. Accordingly, EGD should be performed for assessment of presence of GERD injury/complications but not as a diagnostic tool for confirmation of GERD or to conclude on a causal relationship between extraesophageal symptoms and GERD.

### "Refractory GERD": acid, nonacid, or not GERD? [^e0d71c25]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2004). Low credibility.

Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a common condition with 44% of Americans surveyed reporting heartburn at least once a month and 20% once a week (1, 2). However, despite major advances in our understanding of this disease, management of GERD is still a challenge. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are more effective than H2-receptor antagonists (H2RA) in the initial healing of erosive esophagitis, which provide symptom relief and maintenance (3). Due to its established efficacy and safety, PPI treatment is used as the initial "test" in diagnosing GERD in the absence of bleeding, anemia, weight loss, or dysphagia. A single dose of PPI provides adequate symptom relief in most patients; however, dose escalation to twice a day may be needed in some. Patients unresponsive to PPI therapy are often labeled as having "refractory GERD". However, this term is poorly defined and has a different meaning in different countries. More importantly, the cause of "refractory GERD" is poorly understood.

Extraesophageal GERD conclusions — The page emphasizes that "the cause of extraesophageal symptoms in many patients is often multifactorial rather than from reflux alone," and that "Diagnostic testing is recommended after a course of high-dose empiric acid suppression therapy after which symptoms remain." It adds that "Patients with extraesophageal symptoms without concomitant typical reflux symptoms, such as heartburn or regurgitation, are less likely to benefit from aggressive reflux therapies." It further states that "Escalation of therapy may be justified in those with mechanical barrier issues, such as a large hiatal hernia and proven significant reflux," and "In those unresponsive to a course of medical therapy that is proven objectively to control reflux, de-escalation of acid-suppression therapy and investigation into other potential causes for patients' continued extraesophageal reflux are recommended."

### Medical treatment of supraesophageal complications of gastroesophageal reflux disease [^d4eed281]. The American Journal of Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

A growing number of bronchopulmonary, laryngopharyngeal, and oral cavity disorders are suspected of being caused by gastroesophageal refluxate traveling from the esophageal body. Although diagnostic methods have not been developed to positively identify the etiology of these conditions as being related to refluxate, many patients with these supraesophageal manifestations of gastroesophageal reflux disease (SeGERD) respond to empiric antireflux therapy with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). When used in an appropriate dose (twice daily) and for an appropriate duration (12 weeks or longer), PPIs can be effective in relieving SeGERD symptoms. Economic issues and outcome studies are needed to help further define the role of PPIs in SeGERD.

Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) refractory symptoms — definitions and patient groups: persistent symptoms were reported in 32% of patients in randomized trials and 45% in observational studies. The most commonly accepted definition of refractory GERD is persistent heartburn and/or regurgitation despite 8 weeks of double-dose proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy, whereas other authorities consider persistent symptoms after 12 weeks on double-dose PPIs to be refractory GERD. There are 2 broad groups with symptoms despite PPI therapy — those empirically treated with a PPI yet still symptomatic and those with objective evidence of GERD who have incomplete or no response to PPIs — and the evaluation of refractory GERD should begin with a careful history and physical examination.

Concluding remarks

The management of patients with extraesophageal manifestations of GERD remains challenging. In the absence of specific diagnostic methods capable of identifying individuals who might respond to antireflux therapy, an empiric trial of PPI therapy is the common approach. More invasive diagnostic testing should be reserved for those with poor or partial response to the initial PPI therapy to exclude reflux as the cause of patients' persistent symptoms. Future trials are needed to improve these diagnostic problems and identify the subgroup of individuals with extraesophageal reflux manifestations who may benefit from PPI therapy or antireflux surgery.

### The impact of illness in patients with moderate to severe gastro-esophageal reflux disease [^4340ad03]. BMC Gastroenterology (2005). Low credibility.

Background

The global prevalence of gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD), defined as heartburn once daily, is estimated to range from 5 to 7% but varies widely and depends on the definition used. For example, 25% of the adult population in Belgium, nearly 18% in Australia, 20% in the United States and 9% in Canada reported GERD symptoms once a week or more. While heartburn is the leading symptom in GERD, the disease is associated with a broad range of esophageal problems, including acid regurgitation, epigastric pain, esophageal erosions and complications such as Barrett's esophagus, esophageal adenocarcinoma and esophageal stricture. GERD is also associated with a variety of extra-esophageal problems, including sleep disturbances, noncardiac chest pain, asthma, chronic cough and hoarseness.

Clinicians and health services researchers are becoming more aware of the importance of patient-reported outcomes (PROs), including health related quality of life (HRQL) in understanding the burden of disease and the outcome of medical treatment. While physiologic measures provide information to clinicians, these outcomes are often not important to patients and they correlate poorly with functional status or well-being, the areas in which patients are mostly interested. For example, the majority of patients with typical symptoms of GERD do not have endoscopic evidence of esophagitis. PROs assist in providing a better understanding of treatment outcomes from the patient's perspective by translating clinical improvement into patient-important outcomes. Moreover, HRQL assessment is important for measuring quality of care, clinical effectiveness, and in reimbursement decisions.

The use of validated questionnaires is appropriate for measuring PROs in clinical trials. There are two categories of HRQL measures; disease-specific and generic HRQL instruments. Disease-specific instruments are used to describe the burden of disease and treatment outcomes in patients with a specific disease, and generic instruments measure the overall HRQL of patients, including physical, emotional, and social function, as well as their level of general performance at work and in daily life across different diseases.

### Evaluation of gastroesophageal reflux disease [^1818b42c]. World Journal of Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) may present with heartburn, regurgitation, dysphagia, chronic cough, laryngitis, or even asthma. The clinical presentation of GERD is therefore varied and poses certain challenges to the physician, especially given the limitations of the diagnostic testing.

Discussion

The evaluation of patients with suspected GERD might be challenging. It is based on the evaluation of clinical features, objective evidence of reflux on diagnostic testing, correlation of symptoms with episodes of reflux, evaluation of anatomical abnormalities, and excluding other causes that might account for the presence of the patient's symptoms.

Conclusions

The diagnostic evaluation should include multiple tests, in addition to a thorough clinical examination.

### The university of Chicago contribution to the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease and its complications: a tribute to David B. skinner 1935–2003 [^e5a3341a]. Annals of Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To highlight the contributions from the University of Chicago under the leadership of Dr David B. Skinner to the understanding of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and its complications.

Background

The invention of the esophagoscope confirmed that GERD was a premorbid condition. The medical world was divided between those who believed in a morphological lower esophageal sphincter (LES) and those who did not. Those who did not believe attempted to rearrange the anatomy of the foregut organs to stop reflux with minimal success. The discovery of the LES focused attention on the sphincter as the main deterrent to reflux and the hope that measurement of a low LES pressure would mark the presence of GERD. This turned out not to be so. In July 1973, with this history of confusion, Dr Skinner at the age of 36 assumed the chair of surgery at the University of Chicago.

Methods

The publications of the University of Chicago's esophageal group were collected from private and public (PubMed) databases, reviewed, and seminal contributions selected.

Results

Twenty-four-hour esophageal pH monitoring led to the understanding of the LES, its contribution to GERD, and the complication of Barrett's esophagus. The relationship of Barrett's to adenocarcinoma was clarified. The rising incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma led to contributions in the staging of esophageal cancer and its treatment with an en bloc resection.

Conclusions

Ten years after the death of Dr Skinner, we can appreciate the monumental contributions to benign and malignant esophageal disease under his leadership.

Literature Clinical Pearls & Morning Reports Published September 28, 2022 Gastroesophageal reflux disease is a condition in which the reflux of stomach contents causes troublesome symptoms and complications. Read the NEJM Clinical Practice Article here. Clinical Pearls Q: Describe the range of manifestations associated with GERD. A: Although heartburn and regurgitation are considered typical, a broad range of manifestations have been associated with GERD, including chronic cough, a globus sensation, wheezing, posterior laryngitis, dental erosions, and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Risk factors for GERD include an age of 50 years or older, current smoking, use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, obesity, low socioeconomic status, and female sex. Q: Of patients with GERD, who should undergo upper endoscopy.

A: Upper endoscopy is generally limited to patients with GERD who report alarm symptoms, who have no response or an incomplete response to treatment or have recurrent GERD after a successful 8-week course of empirical therapy, who are candidates for antireflux or bariatric surgery, or who are at increased risk for Barrett's esophagus. A: Pharmacologic treatment for GERD includes medications taken as needed or daily. The medications that are most frequently used are antacids, histamine2 blockers, and proton pump inhibitors. PPIs are the most effective medication for GERD symptom relief, healing of erosive esophagitis, and prevention of disease relapse and complications.

In a meta-analysis of randomized, controlled trials of antireflux therapies in patients with erosive esophagitis, the percentage of patients with esophageal healing within 12 weeks after starting treatment was 51. 9% with histamine2-receptor antagonists as compared with
83. 6% with PPIs, and healing was more rapid with PPIs. Moreover, PPIs were superior to histamine2-receptor antagonists in relieving symptoms, maintaining symptom relief, and preventing complications. PPIs should be used at the lowest dose that controls the patient's symptoms and esophageal inflammation, and the appropriateness of treatment should be periodically reevaluated.

The "art" and science of symptom assessment in the evaluation of patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease has been under emphasized. In fact, it is critical to judgements regarding surgical versus non-surgical therapy and is much more difficult than meets the eye. Many symptoms thought to be secondary to gastroesophageal reflux are not, and some, such as asthma cough and chest pain, which are commonly thought secondary to other causes, are indeed symptoms of reflux. Diagnostic studies are helpful but far from perfect, ultimately requiring the clinician's expert judgement as the key factor in determining a successful outcome. The following outlines both an approach to the assessment of symptoms and when possible, clinical studies shedding light on their cause and interpretation.

### Gastroesophageal reflux disease: a typical spectrum disease (a new conceptual framework is not needed) [^256fd567]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2004). Low credibility.

Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a common GI disorder, particularly frequent in the primary care setting, with a high direct and indirect economic burden on society. Despite the high prevalence and costs of the disease, the epidemiology and natural history of GERD have not been fully elucidated. It has recently been suggested to abandon the current model of GERD as a "spectrum" disease and to adopt a new conceptual framework, e.g., categorizing GERD into three unique groups of patients: nonerosive reflux disease, erosive esophagitis, and Barrett's esophagus. In the present review we present arguments against this proposal, and argue that the concept of a single disease, potentially progressing from mild nonerosive forms toward metaplasia and neoplasia (adenocarcinoma), still holds true and may in fact help us in planning the diagnostic and therapeutic approach as well as in allocating financial resources much better than the proposed model of a "tripartited" disease. Independently from the conceptual model adopted, however, more data on the natural history of patients with GERD are eagerly needed.

### Extraesophageal symptoms and diseases attributed to GERD: where is the pendulum swinging now? [^388beef5]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2018). Medium credibility.

AGA Clinical Practice Update — Extraesophageal symptoms attributed to gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) provides the following diagnostic guidance: Best Practice Advice 1: The role of a gastroenterologist in patients referred for evaluation of suspected extra esophageal symptom is to assess for gastroesophageal etiologies that could contribute to the presenting symptoms. Best Practice Advice 2: Non-GI evaluations by ENT, pulmonary and/or allergy are essential and often should be performed initially in most patients as the cause of the symptoms are more likely explained by these other entities than reflux. Best Practice Advice 3: Empiric therapy with aggressive acid suppression for 6–8 weeks with special focus on response of the extraesophageal symptoms can help in assessing association between reflux and extraesophageal symptoms. Best Practice Advice 4: No single testing methodology exists to definitively identify reflux as the etiology for the suspected extra esophageal symptoms. Best Practice Advice 5: Constellation of patient presentation, diagnostic test results and response to therapy should be employed in the determination of reflux as a possible etiology in extra esophageal symptoms. Best Practice Advice 6: Testing may need to be off or on proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy depending on patients' presenting demographics and symptoms in assessing the likelihood of abnormal gastroesophageal reflux. A. On therapy testing may be considered in those with high probability of baseline reflux. B. Off therapy testing may be considered in those with low probability of baseline reflux with the goal of identifying moderate to severe reflux at baseline.

### Investigation of extraesophageal gastroesophageal reflux disease [^e053fd90]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a commonly diagnosed chronic disorder in the western countries. According to the Montreal Classification, GERD is defined as a condition that develops when the reflux of stomach contents causes troublesome symptoms and/or complications. Despite the fact that GERD typically presents with esophageal symptoms such as heartburn and regurgitation, it may also present with extraesophageal symptoms. The most common extraesophageal manifestations of GERD include chronic cough, asthma and laryngitis (Table 1).

Table 1
Montreal definition of gastroesophageal reflux disease and its constituent syndromes

There are two mechanisms proposed to explain extraesophageal syndromes caused by GERD. The first one is a direct way via irritation and/or microaspiration and the second one is an indirect, vagally mediated way. Irritation occurs with the entrance of gastroduodenal contents into the pharynx and larynx with or without microaspiration in deeper airways due to the disturbance of the normal protective mechanisms. In the second mechanism, symptoms are caused by vagally mediated esophago-tracheal-bronchial reflex when reflux reaches the lower esophagus. It is known by embryological studies that esophagus and bronchial tree share a common innervation via the vagus nerve.

Nowadays, several tests have improved the diagnostic field of typical GERD. However, the investigation of extraesophageal manifestations of GERD is still difficult, and new methods and studies are needed to improve these diagnostic problems.

Extraesophageal reflux — surgical therapy evidence — lacks randomized comparisons with proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy, and only one study comparing Nissen fundoplication with histamine-2 receptor antagonists (H2RAs) showed 75% improvement after 2 years in surgically treated patients versus 9% with H2RAs; concerns include a high risk-to-benefit ratio and that most series in chronic cough, laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR), and asthma are uncontrolled, retrospective, and small, so most surgeons shy away from offering fundoplication to patients without typical heartburn and/or regurgitation.

Regarding specific circumstances for gastroesophageal reflux disease, more specifically with respect to patients with extraesophageal symptoms, evaluation, ACG 2022 guidelines recommend to recognize that demonstration of erosive esophagitis by endoscopy establishes a diagnosis of GERD but does not confirm that GERD is the cause of extraesophageal symptoms. Consider obtaining pH/impedance testing for confirmation.

### ACG clinical guideline for the diagnosis and management of gastroesophageal reflux disease [^d250fe41]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

Extraesophageal GERD symptoms — diagnostic and treatment recommendations emphasize conservative attribution and objective testing. "We recommend evaluation for non-GERD causes in patients with possible extraesophageal manifestations before ascribing symptoms to GERD." "We recommend that patients who have extraesophageal manifestations of GERD without typical GERD symptoms (e.g., heartburn and regurgitation) undergo reflux testing for evaluation before PPI therapy." For those with both typical and extraesophageal symptoms, "we suggest considering a trial of twice-daily PPI therapy for 8–12 weeks before additional testing." Endoscopy is discouraged as a standalone diagnostic for extraesophageal syndromes: "We suggest that upper endoscopy should not be used as the method to establish a diagnosis of GERD-related asthma, chronic cough, or laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR)." Procedural interventions require proof of reflux: "In patients treated for extraesophageal reflux disease, surgical or endoscopic antireflux procedures are only recommended in patients with objective evidence of reflux."

### Extraesophageal presentations of GERD: where is the science? [^3d5f18e1]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

This article reviews the evaluation and management of patients with suspected extraesophageal manifestations of gastroesophageal reflux disease, such as asthma, chronic cough, and laryngitis, which are commonly encountered in gastroenterology practices. Otolaryngologists and gastroenterologists commonly disagree upon the underlying cause for complaints in patients with one of the suspected extraesophageal reflux syndromes. The accuracy of diagnostic tests (laryngoscopy, endoscopy, and pH- or pH-impedance monitoring) for patients with suspected extraesophageal manifestations of gastroesophageal reflux disease is suboptimal. An empiric trial of proton pump inhibitors in patients without alarm features can help some patients, but the response to therapy is variable.

### Extraesophageal symptoms and diseases attributed to GERD: where is the pendulum swinging now? [^1d647d47]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2018). Low credibility.

The purpose of this review is to outline the recent developments in the field of extraesophageal reflux disease and provide clinically relevant recommendations. The recommendations outlined in this review are based on expert opinion and on relevant publications from PubMed and EMbase. The Clinical Practice Updates Committee of the American Gastroenterological Association proposes the following recommendations: Best Practice Advice 1: The role of a gastroenterologist in patients referred for evaluation of suspected extra esophageal symptom is to assess for gastroesophageal etiologies that could contribute to the presenting symptoms. Best Practice Advice 2: Non-GI evaluations by ENT, pulmonary and/or allergy are essential and often should be performed initially in most patients as the cause of the extraesophageal symptom is commonly multifactorial or not esophageal in origin. Best Practice Advice 3: Empiric therapy with aggressive acid suppression for 6–8 weeks with special focus on response of the extraesophageal symptoms can help in assessing association between reflux and extraesophageal symptoms. Best Practice Advice 4: No single testing methodology exists to definitively identify reflux as the etiology for the suspected extra esophageal symptoms. Best Practice Advice 5: Constellation of patient presentation, diagnostic test results and response to therapy should be employed in the determination of reflux as a possible etiology in extra esophageal symptoms. Best Practice Advice 6: Testing may need to be off or on proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy depending on patients' presenting demographics and symptoms in assessing the likelihood of abnormal gastroesophageal reflux. A. On therapy testing may be considered in those with high probability of baseline reflux (those with previous esophagitis, Barrett's esophagus or abnormal pH). B. Off therapy testing may be considered in those with low probability of baseline reflux with the goal of identifying moderate to severe reflux at baseline. Best Practice Advice 7: Lack of response to aggressive acid suppressive therapy combined with normal pH testing off therapy or impedance-pH testing on therapy significantly reduces the likelihood that reflux is a contributing etiology in presenting extraesophageal symptoms. Best Practice Advice 8: Surgical fundoplication is discouraged in those with extra esophageal reflux symptoms unresponsive to aggressive PPI therapy. Best Practice Advice 9: Fundoplication should only be considered in those with a mechanical defect (e.g., hiatal hernia), moderate to severe reflux at baseline off PPI therapy who have continued reflux despite PPI therapy and have failed more conservative non-GI treatments.

### Is empiric proton pump inhibition in patients with symptoms of extraesophageal gastroesophageal reflux justified? [^05b1b756]. BMC Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The management of suspected EE manifestations of GERD including LPR is hampered by uncertainties regarding diagnosis, causality, and treatment efficacy. The benefits of a PPI trial lasting three to six months before 24-hour pH and impedance monitoring seem very low. Although this practice is suggested by society guidelines and considered cost effective in many countries it will lead to long-term PPI use in a high number of patients without any benefit and increased risk of side effects. Diagnostic testing with pH and impedance monitoring rather than empiric PPI treatment should be chosen in a higher proportion of patients presenting with symptoms possibly attributable to EE reflux.

### Effective and safe proton pump inhibitor therapy in acid-related diseases – A position paper addressing benefits and potential harms of acid suppression [^bbcc5593]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

GER (i.e. the reflux of gastric contents into the esophagus) is a physiological phenomenon, occurring in everybody, especially after large and fat meals. Under physiological conditions, efficient esophageal clearing mechanisms return most of the refluxed material to the stomach and symptoms do not occur. However, when the reflux of gastric contents is large or aggressive enough, it causes troublesome symptoms and/or complications and adversely affects health-related quality of life, giving rise to GERD. The Montreal consensus subclassified the disease into esophageal and extra-esophageal syndromes, with established or proposed associations with GER. Up to two-third of patients with esophageal symptoms have a macroscopically normal mucosa at endoscopy. Such patients are usually considered to have NERD.

GERD is primarily a motor disorder and its pathogenesis is multifactorial. The main motility abnormalities include an impaired function of the lower esophageal sphincter, an abnormal esophageal clearance and a delayed gastric emptying in up to 40% of cases. The presence of hiatal hernia favors reflux, but this association is not mandatory. The ultimate consequence of the above motor abnormalities is the presence of acid in the wrong place (i.e. in contact with the esophageal mucosa). In addition, the amount of reflux increases markedly after meals in both healthy subjects and in GERD patients, an event almost exclusively due to the increase of transient (inappropriate) lower esophageal sphincter relaxations by food-induced gastric accommodation. Despite the buffering content of food, the pH of the material refluxed into the distal esophagus is acidic due to the presence of an "acid pocket", which occurs in both healthy subjects and GERD patients. It represents an area of unbuffered gastric acid that accumulates in the proximal stomach after meals and serves as a reservoir for acid reflux. The abnormal esophageal exposure to acid, on the other hand, is not secondary to gastric acid hypersecretion, which has been documented in only a small subset of GERD patients. All the above pathophysiological mechanisms are exaggerated in obese subjects.

### American Gastroenterological Association medical position statement on the management of gastroesophageal reflux disease [^6256d996]. Gastroenterology (2008). Medium credibility.

Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) chronic management — progression and endoscopic monitoring: Grade D: recommend against routine endoscopy in subjects with erosive or nonerosive reflux disease to assess for disease progression. In subjects with a healed mucosa at index endoscopy, the likelihood of these developing within a 7-year follow-up period is on the order of 1.9%, 0.0%, and 0.1%, respectively, and the likelihood of developing Barrett's esophagus with healing of Los Angeles C or D esophagitis is about 6%. Most importantly, endoscopically monitoring patients with chronic GERD symptoms has not been shown to diminish the risk of cancer, and this practice is discouraged.

Post-PPI trial evaluation in suspected extraesophageal gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) — best practice advice: In patients with suspected extraesophageal manifestation of GERD who have failed one trial (up to 12 weeks) of PPI therapy, one should consider objective testing for pathologic GER, because additional trials of different PPIs are low yield.

### Latin American consensus on diagnosis of gastroesophageal reflux disease [^a2a81206]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Diagnosing gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) can be challenging given varying symptom presentations, and complex multifactorial pathophysiology. The gold standard for GERD diagnosis is esophageal acid exposure time (AET) measured by pH-metry. A variety of additional diagnostic tools are available. The goal of this consensus was to assess the individual merits of GERD diagnostic tools based on current evidence, and provide consensus recommendations following discussion and voting by experts.

Methods

This consensus was developed by 15 experts from nine countries, based on a systematic search of the literature, using GRADE (grading of recommendations, assessment, development and evaluation) methodology to assess the quality and strength of the evidence, and provide recommendations regarding the diagnostic utility of different GERD diagnosis tools, using AET as the reference standard.

Key Results

A proton pump inhibitor (PPI) trial is appropriate for patients with heartburn and no alarm symptoms, but nor for patients with regurgitation, chest pain, or extraesophageal presentations. Severe erosive esophagitis and abnormal reflux monitoring off PPI are clearly indicative of GERD. Esophagram, esophageal biopsies, laryngoscopy, and pharyngeal pH monitoring are not recommended to diagnose GERD. Patients with PPI-refractory symptoms and normal endoscopy require reflux monitoring by pH or pH-impedance to confirm or exclude GERD, and identify treatment failure mechanisms. GERD confounders need to be considered in some patients, pH-impedance can identify supragrastric belching, impedance-manometry can diagnose rumination.

Conclusions

Erosive esophagitis on endoscopy and abnormal pH or pH-impedance monitoring are the most appropriate methods to establish a diagnosis of GERD. Other tools may add useful complementary information.

### Is empiric proton pump inhibition in patients with symptoms of extraesophageal gastroesophageal reflux justified? [^419a25b9]. BMC Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The prevalence of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) has had a marked increase in Western countries with a paralleling interest in extraesophageal (EE) manifestations of GERD, including laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR). There are considerable differences in clinical practice between gastroenterologists, otolaryngologists and pulmonologists.

Methods

In this narrative review we address some of these controversies concerning EE manifestations of GERD and LPR.

Results

It is disputed whether there is causal relationship between reflux and the numerous symptoms and conditions suggested to be EE manifestations of GERD. Similarly, the pathophysiology is uncertain and there are disagreements concerning diagnostic criteria. Consequently, it is challenging to provide evidence-based treatment recommendations. A significant number of patients are given a trial course with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) for several months before symptoms are evaluated. In randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and meta-analyses of RCTs PPI treatment does not seem to be advantageous over placebo, and the evidence supporting that patients without verified GERD have any benefit of PPI treatment is negligible. There is a large increase in both over the counter and prescribed PPI use in several countries and a significant proportion of this use is without any symptomatic benefit for the patients. Whereas short-term treatment has few side effects, there is concern about side-effects after long-term use. Although empiric PPI treatment for suspected EE manifestations of GERD instead of prior esophageal 24-hour pH and impedance monitoring is included in several guidelines by various societies, this practice contributes to overtreatment with PPI.

Conclusion

We argue that the current knowledge suggests that diagnostic testing with pH and impedance monitoring rather than empiric PPI treatment should be chosen in a higher proportion of patients presenting with symptoms possibly attributable to EE reflux.

### Nonerosive reflux disease – current concepts and dilemmas [^d049db15]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2001). Low credibility.

Nonerosive reflux disease is defined as the presence of typical symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease caused by intraesophageal acid in the absence of visible esophageal mucosal injury at endoscopy. Recent studies demonstrate that it is a chronic disease with a significant impact on quality of life, and it is very common in primary care settings. Treatment with acid inhibitory agents is effective, and proton pump inhibitors are the most effective form of therapy.
