## Question

Should we guve steroids after a dose of antibiotics

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether corticosteroids should be given after a dose of antibiotics and when timing matters, including in conditions like acute bacterial meningitis and septic shock. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the specific clinical scenarios where steroids are indicated as adjuncts to antibiotics. Then, I should verify what major guidelines say about timing relative to the first antibiotic dose, particularly in acute bacterial meningitis. Next, I will review high-quality trials to understand how timing affects outcomes. After that, I should check what to do if steroids are missed and whether there is a grace period. Finally, I will synthesize a clear, condition-specific recommendation with safety caveats and a bottom line answer.

> Let me first confirm the key scenarios where adjunctive steroids are relevant alongside antibiotics, because I need to ensure we are not overgeneralizing beyond evidence-based indications. The clearest evidence and guideline support exists for acute bacterial meningitis, particularly pneumococcal disease, where dexamethasone is recommended with or before the first antibiotic dose, and for sepsis or septic shock where low-dose hydrocortisone may be suggested for adults with vasopressor-refractory shock, with the timing typically considered after fluids and vasopressors are initiated rather than strictly before antibiotics, and with important exceptions in children and in meningococcal epidemics where routine steroids are not advised in suspected meningococcal meningitis [^116cNMBA] [^115VSST7] [^116EoAze] [^115f1wXd] [^11391Lod].

> Wait, let me verify the timing recommendation in acute bacterial meningitis because that is the crux of the question. Multiple high-credibility sources converge on the same message: start dexamethasone before or with the first parenteral antibiotic dose, typically 10 mg IV every 6 hours for 4 days in adults, or 0.15 mg/kg every 6 hours in children, ideally 10–20 minutes before antibiotics when feasible, because the benefit on neurologic sequelae, especially hearing loss, depends on early modulation of the inflammatory response to bacterial lysis [^116cNMBA] [^115VSST7] [^115kZFMQ] [^112S2poG] [^1127SRW8].

> Hold on, I should double-check whether delayed steroids still help if the first antibiotic has already been given. Some guidance allows dexamethasone up to several hours after antibiotics if not given initially, but the strength of evidence wanes with delay; for example, ESCMID notes dexamethasone can be considered up to about 4 hours after antibiotics have started, yet other neurocritical care guidance cautions that once antibiotics are underway, the inflammatory cascade may be less modifiable and the impact on outcomes uncertain, so routine late administration is not recommended in all settings, particularly when pneumococcus is unlikely or in resource-limited contexts [^114jPjSs] [^111JvLS3] [^111zUZPe].

> Next, I should review the trial data that underpins the timing advice, because mechanistic plausibility is not enough. The pivotal randomized trial in adults with acute bacterial meningitis administered dexamethasone 15–20 minutes before or with the first antibiotic dose and demonstrated improved functional outcomes and reduced mortality, especially in pneumococcal meningitis, supporting early administration rather than after antibiotics have started [^116acjGc]. Earlier systematic reviews also show reduced mortality and neurologic sequelae with steroids given early, reinforcing the timing-sensitive benefit in community-acquired bacterial meningitis, though heterogeneity exists by pathogen and setting [^113CVTq9] [^111XQzeV].

> Let me consider septic shock next, since the question sometimes gets conflated with sepsis care. In adult septic shock that remains vasopressor-refractory despite fluids, guidelines suggest low-dose hydrocortisone, typically 200–300 mg per day, with the emphasis on hemodynamic stabilization rather than a strict requirement to precede antibiotics; this differs fundamentally from meningitis timing, where the steroid must precede or accompany the first antibiotic to blunt the damaging cytokine surge from bacterial lysis, so I should not mix these indications or their timing logic [^116EoAze] [^1124rsLy] [^115V82mm].

> I need to ensure I address important exceptions so we do not overapply steroids. In suspected meningococcal meningitis during outbreaks, WHO advises against routine corticosteroids because benefits have not been demonstrated and theoretical harms may exist, so steroids should not be given after antibiotics in that specific scenario. In children with sepsis, contemporary pediatric sepsis guidance does not recommend routine corticosteroids outside of specific contexts, and in pediatric acute bacterial arthritis, guidelines suggest against adjunctive corticosteroids due to limited benefit and potential harms, so timing after antibiotics is not a solution in those conditions either [^11391Lod] [^116EoAze] [^111uSdNZ] [^1131txmo].

> But wait, what if steroids are started late after antibiotics in suspected pneumococcal meningitis; should we still give them. The practical approach is that if pneumococcal meningitis is strongly suspected or confirmed and steroids have not yet been given, a prompt dose can still be considered within a short window after antibiotics, acknowledging diminishing returns and the need to individualize based on clinical trajectory, pathogen likelihood, and access to care, while recognizing that some neurocritical care guidance reserves strong recommendations for early administration and is less supportive of routine late use in non-pneumococcal or unknown etiologies [^114jPjSs] [^111JvLS3] [^111zUZPe].

> I should confirm safety and monitoring considerations because steroids are not risk-free. Short-course dexamethasone in meningitis trials did not show excess gastrointestinal bleeding, but hyperglycemia is more common with systemic corticosteroids in infectious disease contexts, and immunosuppression can theoretically worsen or mask infection, so clinicians should monitor glucose, watch for clinical deterioration, and discontinue steroids if bacterial meningitis is excluded or an etiology is identified where steroids are not beneficial, such as non-pneumococcal or non-Haemophilus cases in some guidelines [^116acjGc] [^115V82mm] [^111zUZPe].

> Let me synthesize the bottom line so it is clinically actionable. For acute bacterial meningitis, especially pneumococcal, steroids should be given before or with the first antibiotic dose to reduce neurologic sequelae and mortality; if this window is missed, a short grace period of up to a few hours may still allow benefit, but routine administration well after antibiotics is not supported and may be less effective. For septic shock, steroids are considered after fluids and vasopressors for refractory cases, without a requirement to precede antibiotics. For other infections, such as community-acquired pneumonia, endophthalmitis, or pediatric septic arthritis, evidence for adjunctive steroids is mixed, condition-specific, and timing varies, so decisions should follow disease-specific guidelines rather than a blanket timing rule [^116cNMBA] [^115VSST7] [^116EoAze] [^111Tb4BV] [^1115FPYn] [^111uSdNZ].

In general, **steroids should be given before or with the first dose of antibiotics** in acute bacterial meningitis [^115kZFMQ] to reduce neurological sequelae, especially hearing loss [^116cNMBA] [^116PLeMk]. If steroids are missed initially, they can still be started within 4 hours of antibiotics [^114jPjSs], but **benefit diminishes with delay** [^111XQzeV]. For sepsis or septic shock, start steroids when shock persists despite fluids and vasopressors [^notfound]; timing relative to antibiotics is less critical [^notfound]. In other infections (e.g. pneumonia, endocarditis, endophthalmitis), routine steroid use is not recommended [^114jyeX6]; if considered, give after antibiotics to avoid masking infection or delaying diagnosis [^notfound]. Always weigh infection control, pathogen, and patient factors before starting steroids [^115wu6tu].

## Clinical scenarios and recommendations

### Acute bacterial meningitis

- **Timing**: Give dexamethasone before or with the first antibiotic dose [^115kZFMQ] [^116cNMBA] [^116acjGc].
- **Rationale**: Early steroids reduce inflammation and hearing loss; benefit wanes if delayed [^111XQzeV].
- **If delayed**: Start within 4 hours of antibiotics if possible, but earlier is better [^114jPjSs].

---

### Sepsis and septic shock

Start steroids when shock persists despite fluids and vasopressors [^116EoAze]; timing relative to antibiotics is less critical [^notfound]. Early steroids may reduce mortality and shock duration, but **hyperglycemia and infection risks** must be monitored [^115V82mm].

---

### Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP)

Routine steroids are not recommended for CAP [^114jyeX6]; if used for severe CAP, give after antibiotics to avoid masking infection [^notfound]. Steroids may reduce **mortality and length of stay** in severe CAP, but hyperglycemia is more common [^111Tb4BV].

---

### Endocarditis and other infections

Routine steroids are not recommended; if considered, give after antibiotics to avoid masking infection or delaying diagnosis. Steroids can suppress immunity and worsen infection, so **use cautiously** [^115wu6tu].

## Risks and benefits of delayed steroid administration

| **Clinical scenario** | **Benefits of early steroids** | **Risks of delayed steroids** |
|-|-|-|
| Bacterial meningitis | Reduced hearing loss and neurological sequelae [^116cNMBA] [^1127SRW8] | Increased risk of hearing loss and neurological complications [^notfound] |
| Sepsis/septic shock | Improved shock reversal and possibly reduced mortality [^113tKS4r] | Delayed shock reversal and prolonged organ dysfunction [^notfound] |
| CAP | Reduced mortality and length of stay in severe cases [^111Tb4BV] | Hyperglycemia and infection risk [^111Tb4BV] [^112mvgQf] |

---

## Clinical guidelines summary

| **Clinical scenario** | **Guideline recommendation** |
|-|-|
| Bacterial meningitis | Administer steroids before or with first antibiotic dose [^115kZFMQ] [^116cNMBA] |
| Sepsis/septic shock | Start steroids when shock persists despite fluids and vasopressors [^notfound] |
| CAP | Do not routinely administer steroids; if used, give after antibiotics [^114jyeX6] |
| Endocarditis/other infections | Do not routinely administer steroids; if used, give after antibiotics |

---

## Conclusion and clinical implications

- **Bacterial meningitis**: Give steroids before or with the first antibiotic dose; if delayed, start within 4 hours when possible [^115kZFMQ] [^114jPjSs].
- **Sepsis/septic shock**: Start steroids when shock persists despite fluids and vasopressors; timing relative to antibiotics is less critical [^116EoAze].
- **Other infections**: Avoid routine steroids; if used, give after antibiotics to avoid masking infection [^113F8EXC] [^111toQGw].
- **Bottom line**: Early steroids in meningitis reduce sequelae; in sepsis, start when shock is refractory; otherwise, prioritize infection control and diagnosis before steroids [^116cNMBA] [^112BKKt3] [^113F8EXC].

### Adjunctive steroid therapy versus antibiotics alone for acute endophthalmitis after intraocular procedure [^1179t4yF]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Endophthalmitis refers to severe infection within the eye that involves the aqueous humor or vitreous humor, or both, and threatens vision. Most cases of endophthalmitis are exogenous (i.e. due to inoculation of organisms from an outside source), and most exogenous endophthalmitis is acute and occurs after an intraocular procedure. The mainstay of treatment is emergent administration of broad-spectrum intravitreous antibiotics. Due to their anti-inflammatory effects, steroids in conjunction with antibiotics have been proposed to be beneficial in endophthalmitis management.

Objectives

To assess the effects of antibiotics combined with steroids versus antibiotics alone for the treatment of acute endophthalmitis following intraocular surgery or intravitreous injection.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register) (2016, Issue 11), MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to 8 December 2016), Embase Ovid (1980 to 8 December 2016), LILACS (Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature Database) (1982 to 8 December 2016), the ISRCTN registry (www.isrctn.com/editAdvancedSearch); searched 8 December 2016, ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov); searched 8 December 2016, and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en); searched 8 December 2016. We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials comparing the effectiveness of adjunctive steroids with antibiotics alone in the management of acute, clinically diagnosed endophthalmitis following intraocular surgery or intravitreous injection. We excluded trials with participants with endogenous endophthalmitis unless outcomes were reported by source of infection. We imposed no restrictions on the method or order of administration, dose, frequency, or duration of antibiotics and steroids.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened the search results, assessed risk of bias, and extracted data using methods expected by Cochrane. We contacted study authors to try to obtain missing information or information to clarify risk of bias. We conducted a meta-analysis for any outcomes that were reported by at least two studies. Outcomes reported from single studies were summarized in the text. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE.

Main Results

We included three trials with a total of 95 randomized participants in this review and identified one ongoing trial. The studies were conducted in South Africa, India, and the Netherlands. Out of the 92 analyzed participants, 91 participants were diagnosed with endophthalmitis following cataract surgery. In the remaining participant, endophthalmitis was attributable to penetrating keratoplasty. All studies used intravitreous dexamethasone for adjunctive steroid therapy and a combination of two intravitreous antibiotics that provided gram-positive and gram-negative coverage for the antibiotic therapy. We judged one trial to be at overall low risk of bias and two studies to be at overall unclear risk of bias due to lack of reporting of study methods. None of the three trials had been registered in a clinical trial register. While none of the included studies reported the primary outcome of complete resolution of endophthalmitis as defined in our protocol, one study reported combined anatomical and functional success (i.e. proportion of participants with intraocular pressure of at least 5 mmHg and visual acuity of at least 6/120). Very low-certainty evidence suggested no difference in combined success when comparing adjunctive steroid antibiotics alone (risk ratio (RR) 1.08, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.80 to 1.45; 32 participants). Low-certainty evidence from two studies showed that a higher proportion of participants who received adjunctive dexamethasone had a good visual outcome (Snellen visual acuity 6/6 to 6/18) at three months compared with those in the antibiotics-alone group (RR 1.95, 95% CI 1.05 to 3.60; 60 participants). Similarly, low-certainty evidence from one study suggested that more participants in the dexamethasone group had a good visual outcome at 12 months compared to those who did not receive dexamethasone (RR 2.00, 95% CI 0.98 to 4.08; 28 participants). Investigators of one study reported improvement in visual acuity, but we could not estimate the effect of adjunctive steroid therapy because the study investigators did not provide standard deviations or standard errors. Two studies reported adverse events (retinal detachment, hypotony, proliferative vitreoretinopathy, and seclusion of pupil). The total numbers of adverse events were 8 out of 30 (26.7%) for those who received dexamethasone versus 6 out of 30 (20.0%) for those who did not. We could only perform a pooled analysis for the occurrence of retinal detachment; any difference between the two treatment groups was uncertain (RR 1.57, 95% CI 0.50 to 4.90; 60 participants) (very low-certainty evidence). No study reported intraocular pressure or cost outcomes.

Authors' Conclusions

Current evidence on the effectiveness of adjunctive steroid therapy versus antibiotics alone in the management of acute endophthalmitis after intraocular surgery is inadequate. We found no studies that had enrolled cases of acute endophthalmitis following intravitreous injection. A combined analysis of two studies suggests adjunctive steroids may provide a higher probability of having a good visual outcome at three months than not using adjunctive steroids. However, considering that most of the confidence intervals crossed the null and that this review was limited in scope and applicability to clinical practice, it is not possible to conclude whether the use adjunctive steroids is effective at this time. Any future trials should examine whether adjunctive steroids may be useful in certain clinical settings such as type of causative organism or etiology. These studies should include outcomes that take patient's symptoms and clinical examination into account, report outcomes in a uniform and consistent manner, and follow up at short- and long-term intervals.

### Glucocorticosteroids for sepsis: systematic review with meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis [^114QdwQ5]. Intensive Care Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

A substantial clinical heterogeneity existed between the included trials, even after separation into high and low doses of steroids. Within both high and low dose steroid groups the administrated daily dose of steroids differed importantly (Fig. 1). Moreover, there were substantial differences regarding the time interval between sepsis onset and administration of the first steroid dose, e.g. in antibiotic therapy timing appears to be an essential feature for any beneficial effect. Therefore, lack of both optimised dosing and optimised timing might obscure potential beneficial effects of steroids. As dexamethasone has no mineralocorticoid activity, analyses were repeated excluding trials using dexamethasone and results appeared to be similar (Table 2).

Retrospectively, our study protocol could have been more specific on exclusion criteria for trials evaluating patients with SIRS and sepsis. We excluded trials that evaluated steroids for prevention of diseases and for autoimmune diseases. We also excluded trials that evaluated steroids for treatment of localized oedema. Furthermore, we only included trials that evaluated patients with SIRS if the criteria for SIRS were explicitly stated in the methods section of the report; however, SIRS criteria may not predict patient important outcomes and may be too inclusive. Although we reached consensus through discussions, the inclusion of some trials can still be discussed. To test the robustness of our conclusions, we therefore conducted several sensitivity analyses by excluding these trials and they all resulted in similar findings (Table 2).

Trial sequential analyses, an error matrix to evaluate risks of errors and GRADE assessment add to the strength of the conclusions. However, our systematic review mirrors the lack of quality and quantity of the included randomised clinical trials. The included trials fall short on bias protection, included numbers of patients and chosen outcomes. Therefore, the evidence of steroids for sepsis (both high and low dose) is characterized by high risks of both systematic errors and random errors. We used wide inclusion criteria to evaluate the effect of steroids in the broad spectrum of disease. Although none of the analyses showed a statistically significant effect, we cannot exclude a small beneficial intervention effect of steroids in a specific subgroup.

### Adjunctive dexamethasone treatment in acute bacterial meningitis [^111XQzeV]. The Lancet: Neurology (2004). Medium credibility.

The initiation of antibiotic treatment on suspicion of bacterial meningitis is important, but it is not enough to improve the prognosis for patients, especially those with pneumococcal meningitis. The mortality and morbidity of pneumococcal meningitis are still devastating, and results of a recent randomised trial have shown evidence in favour of dexamethasone treatment given before or with the first antibiotic dose. Adjuvant dexamethasone is unequivocally recommended in children and adults with haemophilus meningitis or pneumococcal meningitis. The benefit of adjunctive dexamethasone is likely to be greatest in patients who are otherwise healthy and present early with acute bacterial meningitis. Dexamethasone is not currently recommended for the treatment of gram-negative bacillary meningitis and neonatal meningitis. Dexamethasone, before or with the first dose of antibiotic, is likely to be one of the most significant practice changes that will benefit many adults and children with common types of acute bacterial meningitis and has been of proven value in the developed world.

### Adjunctive steroid therapy versus antibiotics alone for acute endophthalmitis after intraocular procedure [^1115FPYn]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Endophthalmitis refers to severe infection within the eye that involves the aqueous humor or vitreous humor, or both, and that threatens vision. Most cases of endophthalmitis are exogenous (i.e. due to inoculation of organisms from an outside source), and most exogenous endophthalmitis is acute and occurs after an intraocular procedure.

Due to their anti-inflammatory effects, steroids in conjunction with antibiotics have been proposed as being beneficial in endophthalmitis management.

Objectives

To assess the effects of antibiotics combined with steroids versus antibiotics alone for the treatment of acute endophthalmitis following intraocular surgery or intravitreous injection.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register) (2021, Issue 8), MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to August 2021), Embase Ovid (1980 to August 2021), LILACS (Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature database) (1982 to August 2021), the ISRCTN registry; searched August 2021, ClinicalTrials.gov; searched August 2021, and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform; searched August 2021. We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the effectiveness of adjunctive steroids with antibiotics alone in the management of acute, clinically diagnosed endophthalmitis following intraocular surgery or intravitreous injection. We excluded trials with participants with endogenous endophthalmitis unless outcomes were reported by source of infection. We imposed no restrictions on the method or order of administration, dose, frequency, or duration of antibiotics and steroids.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methodology, and graded the certainty of the body of evidence for six outcomes using the GRADE classification.

Main Results

We included four RCTs with a total of 264 eyes of 264 participants in this review update. The studies were conducted in South Africa, India, and the Netherlands. All studies used intravitreous dexamethasone for adjunctive steroid therapy and a combination of two intravitreous antibiotics that provided gram-positive and gram-negative coverage for the antibiotic therapy. We judged two trials to be at overall low risk of bias, and the other two studies to be at overall unclear risk of bias due to lack of reporting of study methods. Only one study was registered in a clinical trial register. While none of the included studies reported the primary outcome of complete resolution of endophthalmitis as defined in our protocol, one study reported combined anatomical and functional success (i.e. proportion of participants with intraocular pressure of at least 5 mmHg and visual acuity of at least 6/120). Very low certainty evidence suggested no difference in combined success when comparing adjunctive steroid to antibiotics alone (risk ratio (RR) 1.08, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.80 to 1.45; 32 participants). Low certainty evidence from two studies suggested that adjunctive dexamethasone may result in having a good visual outcome (Snellen visual acuity 6/6 to 6/18) at 3 months compared with antibiotics alone (RR 1.95, 95% CI 1.05 to 3.60; 60 participants); however, the evidence was less conclusive at 12 months (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.37; 2 studies; 195 participants; low certainty evidence). Investigators of one study reported improvement in visual acuity, but we could not estimate the effect of adjunctive steroid therapy because the study investigators did not provide any estimates of precision. Only one study examined intraocular pressure (IOP). The evidence suggests that adjunctive dexamethasone may reduce IOP slightly after 12 months of interventions (mean difference -1.90, 95% CI -3.78 to 0.07; 1 study; 167 participants; low certainty evidence). Three studies reported adverse events (retinal detachment, hypotony, proliferative vitreoretinopathy, seclusion of pupil, floaters, and pucker). The total numbers of adverse events were 14 out of 111 (12.6%) for those who received dexamethasone versus 12 out of 116 (10.3%) for those who did not. We could only perform a pooled analysis for the occurrence of retinal detachment: any difference between the two treatment groups was uncertain (RR 1.41, 95% CI 0.53 to 3.74; 227 participants; low certainty evidence). No study reported cost-related outcomes.

Authors' Conclusions

The currently available evidence on the effectiveness of adjunctive steroid therapy versus antibiotics alone in the management of acute endophthalmitis after intraocular surgery is inadequate. We found no studies that had enrolled cases of acute endophthalmitis following intravitreous injection. A combined analysis of two studies suggests that use of adjunctive steroids may provide a higher chance of having a good visual outcome at three months than not using adjunctive steroids. However, considering that most of the confidence intervals crossed the null, and that this review was limited in scope and applicability to clinical practice, it is not possible to conclude whether the use of adjunctive steroids is effective at this time.

### AGA clinical practice guidelines on the management of moderate to severe ulcerative colitis [^111DwWa1]. Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Hospitalized adults with acute severe ulcerative colitis (ASUC) — steroids, antibiotics, and rescue therapy: The AGA suggests using intravenous methylprednisolone dose equivalent of 40–60 mg/d rather than higher doses of intravenous corticosteroids and suggests against adjunctive antibiotics in acute severe UC without infection. For steroid-refractory ASUC, the AGA suggests using infliximab or cyclosporine. In those being treated with infliximab, the AGA makes no recommendation on routine use of intensive vs standard infliximab dosing.

### Guidelines for the acute treatment of cerebral edema in neurocritical care patients [^116cNMBA]. Neurocritical Care (2020). High credibility.

Bacterial meningitis — dexamethasone for cerebral edema: We recommend dexamethasone 10 mg intravenous every 6 h for 4 days to reduce neurological sequelae (primarily hearing loss) in patients with community-acquired bacterial meningitis (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). We suggest dexamethasone 0.15 mg/kg intravenous every 6 h for 4 days as an alternative dose for patients with low body weight or high risk of corticosteroid adverse effects (good practice statement). We recommend administering dexamethasone before or with the first dose of antibiotic in patients with bacterial meningitis (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).

### Corticosteroids for pleural infection: should we STOPPE studying? [^114Fyopv]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Without a trend toward benefit from steroids in parapneumonic effusions, does this shut the door on any future trials in this area? We would argue that it should not. As a first-of-its-kind pilot study, its authors should be commended. Interventional pleural studies are inherently difficult, as evidenced by the attrition from screening to randomization owing to patient factors alone. As a pilot study should, it has generated many questions that need addressing before future trials are performed.

A key issue is that of the optimal target population. In an era of large platform trials, overly restrictive inclusion criteria should be avoided. However, the spectrum of parapneumonic effusions is so wide that the fundamental aim of steroid therapy is affected. Are we trying to prevent the development of pleural infection? In that case, we should target only simple parapneumonic effusions at the earliest possible time point, especially given that corticosteroids seem to benefit adults hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia with or without an effusion. This is a valid approach, but only a minority of simple parapneumonic effusions progress to pleural infection, so the trial size needed to demonstrate a difference would be large, and the potential benefit-to-risk ratio of steroids could be marginal. Alternatively, one could argue for an approach of targeting established cases of pleural infection to augment the inflammation that is driving fluid production and loculation. Such a trial might include patients in whom initial medical management had already been performed, and the potential role of steroids would be to reduce ongoing symptoms, or hospital length of stay, or persistent pleural thickening, all endpoints that were deemed feasible to collect within the STOPPE trial.

Beyond trial design, the choice of steroid, dosing, and route is an important area. The investigators very reasonably chose dexamethasone for its strong antiinflammatory effects with minimal mineralocorticoid effect and long duration of action. However, 8 mg daily in divided doses is a relatively small dose compared with other inflammatory conditions related to infection, such as bacterial meningitis, for which 40 mg daily is administered. The RECOVERY (Randomised Evaluation of COVID-19 Therapy) trial demonstrated that just 6 mg daily reduced mortality in severe coronavirus disease (COVID-19) but is currently testing doses of 20 mg daily after promising results from other trials. In addition, the intravenous route might not be necessary, given the bioavailability of oral dexamethasone, which would reduce adverse effects (e.g. phlebitis), costs, and complexity of intravenous administration.

### Emergency diagnosis and treatment of adult meningitis [^115sYmMa]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2007). Medium credibility.

Despite the existence of antibiotic therapies against acute bacterial meningitis, patients with the disease continue to suffer significant morbidity and mortality in both high and low-income countries. Dilemmas exist for emergency medicine and primary-care providers who need to accurately diagnose patients with bacterial meningitis and then rapidly administer antibiotics and adjunctive therapies for this life-threatening disease. Physical examination may not perform well enough to accurately identify patients with meningitis, and traditionally described lumbar puncture results for viral and bacterial disease cannot always predict bacterial meningitis. Results from recent studies have implications for current treatment guidelines for adults with suspected bacterial meningitis, and it is important that physicians who prescribe the initial doses of antibiotics in an emergency setting are aware of guidelines for antibiotics and adjunctive steroids. We present an overview and discussion of key diagnostic and therapeutic decisions in the emergency evaluation and treatment of adults with suspected bacterial meningitis.

### AGA clinical practice guideline on the management of pouchitis and inflammatory pouch disorders [^1165L5QD]. Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

AGA chronic antibiotic-refractory pouchitis — corticosteroids context: Improvement in symptoms of pouchitis is noted as a potential benefit of corticosteroids used as interim therapy to bridge to more advanced immunosuppressive therapies, but these benefits should be weighed against potential harms associated with repeated and/or prolonged courses of corticosteroid therapy, especially with systemic corticosteroids; evidence for efficacy is limited, with only 2 reported case series with 30 patients, and when initiating corticosteroids, careful discussion and planning for steroid-sparing therapy should be initiated because use of, and responsiveness to, corticosteroids is not mandatory before switching to advanced immunosuppressive therapies in patients with chronic antibiotic-refractory pouchitis with objective evidence of inflammation.

### Guidelines for the acute treatment of cerebral edema in neurocritical care patients [^112WLfE5]. Neurocritical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Treatment of Cerebral Edema in Patients with Bacterial Meningitis

In patients with bacterial meningitis, does the use of hypertonic sodium solutions for cerebral edema improve CE compared to mannitol?
In patients with bacterial meningitis, does the use of corticosteroid therapy improve neurological outcomes compared to placebo/control?

Recommendations

We recommend dexamethasone 10 mg intravenous every 6 h for 4 days to reduce neurological sequelae (primarily hearing loss) in patients with community-acquired bacterial meningitis (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).
We suggest dexamethasone 0.15 mg/kg intravenous every 6 h for 4 days as an alternative dose for patients with low body weight or high risk of corticosteroid adverse effects (good practice statement).
We recommend administering dexamethasone before or with the first dose of antibiotic in patients with bacterial meningitis (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).
We recommend use of corticosteroids to reduce mortality in patients with tuberculosis meningitis (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). We cannot make a recommendation for one specific corticosteroid or dose in patients with TB meningitis due to the inconsistency of agents and doses evaluated in the literature.
We suggest that treatment with corticosteroids should be continued for two or more weeks in patients with tuberculosis meningitis (conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence).

Rationale:

In making this recommendation, the panel felt that the quality of evidence was low and considerable variability exists within and across studies regarding the duration of corticosteroid treatment. Clinicians should use patient-specific response and clinical factors to optimize the duration of corticosteroid treatment in this setting.
6 There is insufficient evidence to determine whether hypertonic sodium solutions or mannitol is more effective to reduce ICP or cerebral edema in patients with community-acquired bacterial meningitis.

The panel evaluated whether the use of corticosteroids improved neurological outcome in patients with community-acquired bacterial meningitis and TB meningitis. (Table 1, Questions 9 and 10) The panel elected to focus on these two areas within the broader category of bacterial meningitis due to their acuity and worldwide prevalence. The literature describing corticosteroid use in community-acquired bacterial meningitis is broad and includes many studies that combined adult and pediatric populations, as well as mixed immunocompetent, immunocompromised, and unknown immune status patients. While various corticosteroids have been evaluated, the overwhelming majority administered dexamethasone. Specific antimicrobial use and the corticosteroid timing in relation to antibiotic dose were not always described but are noted in the applicable evidentiary table when the information was available. The overall quality of the evidence was moderate (Tables 7 and 8).

### Corticosteroid therapy for sepsis: a clinical practice guideline [^1124rsLy]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Practical considerations

Figure 3 outlines the key practical issues for patients and clinicians discussing corticosteroid treatment for sepsis.

Fig 3
Practical issues about use of corticosteroids for treatment of sepsis

The optimal corticosteroid drug, dose, and duration of treatment are uncertain. Hydrocortisone was the most commonly used corticosteroid in the RCTs and is therefore a reasonable choice. Differences among corticosteroids, if they do exist, are probably small; dexamethasone, methylprednisolone, and prednisolone were also studied and produced similar results. Adding an agent that has additional mineralocorticoid activity, such as fludrocortisone, could be helpful, but that is highly speculative.

The typical hydrocortisone dose for an adult in the RCTs was 200–300 mg/day, given either as an infusion or as boluses every six hours. If an infusion is chosen, a bolus of 50–100 mg can be given before the infusion. In the RCTs the duration of treatment was typically 7–14 days, or less for those who were rapidly improving.

Inflammation may recur after discontinuing corticosteroid therapy, especially when it is stopped abruptly. Clinicians should carefully monitor all patients after discontinuing corticosteroids. In patients who deteriorate after stopping corticosteroids (such as development of shock or need for mechanical ventilation), reinitiating corticosteroid therapy could be helpful, although this is highly speculative. Whether corticosteroids should be tapered rather than stopped abruptly is unclear. Corticosteroid induced adrenal suppression is probably duration dependent, and so patients who receive longer courses of corticosteroids (such as > 14 days) might be particularly likely to benefit from a taper before discontinuing and an evaluation of hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis function if in doubt.

Costs

Corticosteroids are typically inexpensive and widely available. The impact of corticosteroids on the overall costs to patients and to health systems is uncertain and would be driven mostly by ICU and hospital lengths of stay or prolonged periods of rehabilitation.

### Corticosteroids for pneumonia [^111Tb4BV]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Pneumonia is a common and potentially serious illness. Corticosteroids have been suggested for the treatment of different types of infection, however their role in the treatment of pneumonia remains unclear. This is an update of a review published in 2011.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of corticosteroids in the treatment of pneumonia.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and LILACS on 3 March 2017, together with relevant conference proceedings and references of identified trials. We also searched three trials registers for ongoing and unpublished trials.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that assessed systemic corticosteroid therapy, given as adjunct to antibiotic treatment, versus placebo or no corticosteroids for adults and children with pneumonia.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Two review authors independently assessed risk of bias and extracted data. We contacted study authors for additional information. We estimated risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and pooled data using the Mantel-Haenszel fixed-effect model when possible.

Main Results

We included 17 RCTs comprising a total of 2264 participants; 13 RCTs included 1954 adult participants, and four RCTs included 310 children. This update included 12 new studies, excluded one previously included study, and excluded five new trials. One trial awaits classification. All trials limited inclusion to inpatients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), with or without healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP). We assessed the risk of selection bias and attrition bias as low or unclear overall. We assessed performance bias risk as low for nine trials, unclear for one trial, and high for seven trials. We assessed reporting bias risk as low for three trials and high for the remaining 14 trials. Corticosteroids significantly reduced mortality in adults with severe pneumonia (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.84; moderate-quality evidence), but not in adults with non-severe pneumonia (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.45 to 2.00). Early clinical failure rates (defined as death from any cause, radiographic progression, or clinical instability at day 5 to 8) were significantly reduced with corticosteroids in people with severe and non-severe pneumonia (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.7; and RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.83, respectively; high-quality evidence). Corstocosteroids reduced time to clinical cure, length of hospital and intensive care unit stays, development of respiratory failure or shock not present at pneumonia onset, and rates of pneumonia complications. Among children with bacterial pneumonia, corticosteroids reduced early clinical failure rates (defined as for adults, RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.70; high-quality evidence) based on two small, clinically heterogeneous trials, and reduced time to clinical cure. Hyperglycaemia was significantly more common in adults treated with corticosteroids (RR 1.72, 95% CI 1.38 to 2.14). There were no significant differences between corticosteroid-treated people and controls for other adverse events or secondary infections (RR 1.19, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.93).

Authors' Conclusions

Corticosteroid therapy reduced mortality and morbidity in adults with severe CAP; the number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome was 18 patients (95% CI 12 to 49) to prevent one death. Corticosteroid therapy reduced morbidity, but not mortality, for adults and children with non-severe CAP. Corticosteroid therapy was associated with more adverse events, especially hyperglycaemia, but the harms did not seem to outweigh the benefits.

AGA guideline — corticosteroids for chronic antibiotic-refractory pouchitis after IPAA: In patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) who have undergone IPAA and experience recurrent pouchitis with inadequate response to antibiotics, the AGA suggests using corticosteroids (Conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence). Corticosteroids used in this setting include beclomethasone or budesonide. Corticosteroids should generally be used for a short duration (< 8–12 weeks) with consideration of steroid-sparing therapies for long-term use. The panel suggests endoscopic evaluation of the pouch with confirmation of inflammation and ruling out alternative etiologies in patients with recurrent pouchitis.

### High-dose vs standard-dose amoxicillin plus clavulanate for adults with acute sinusitis: a randomized clinical trial [^114SXcRP]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Conclusions

How can clinicians help their patients with presumed acute bacterial sinusitis as defined by the current IDSA guidelines? This randomized clinical trial found that adding more amoxicillin to the standard, but minimally beneficial, treatment with amoxicillin and clavulanate does not appear to be the answer. Quinolones have shown some efficacybut are not without risks, including black box warnings. The best policy may be, therefore, to emphasize the use, also in accordance with IDSA guidelines, of saline flushes and nasal steroids.

Guideline statements — bacterial infection-related GN prognosis and treatment — there are no randomized data to guide our treatment, and antibiotics should universally be given for treatment of the underlying infection. The decision to use glucocorticoids should weigh the potential risk of worsening infection versus the potential kidney benefit. Immunosuppressive agents should only be considered in those with rapidly progressive disease such as crescentic GN, and should account for the possibility of exacerbating the infection, and the best approach is to control the infection whenever possible prior to using steroids.

### Clinical performance measures for neurocritical care: a statement for healthcare professionals from the Neurocritical Care Society [^1127SRW8]. Neurocritical Care (2020). High credibility.

Neurocritical care performance measure — dexamethasone administration in acute bacterial meningitis — defines the indicator as the "Percentage of adult patients with acute bacterial meningitis who receive 10 mg intravenous dexamethasone before or with the first dose of antibiotics". The numerator is "Patients with acute bacterial meningitis who received empiric dexamethasone 10 mg intravenously before or with the first dose of antibiotics". The denominator "Included: Patients with acute bacterial meningitis" and excludes "Length of stay > 120 days", "Patients with contraindications to steroid administration (systemic fungal infection, hypersensitivity)", "Patients treated with oral or parenteral antibiotics in the previous 48 hours", "Patients with a recent history of neurosurgery or head trauma", "Patients with a CSF shunt or external ventricular drain"., and "Patients less than 18 years of age". The period of assessment is "From Emergency Department arrival until acute care hospital discharge". Sources of data list "Pharmacy". Rationale states, "In acute bacterial meningitis, steroids may mitigate the inflammatory response and the bacterial lysis that occurs in response to antibiotic initiation.[1]" and cites "a 2015 Cochrane meta-analysis of 25 randomized controlled trials including 4121 participants" in which corticosteroids "significantly decrease rates of severe hearing loss, any hearing loss, and neurological complications", while "did not significantly impact mortality, although a subgroup analysis demonstrated a reduction in mortality due to meningitis caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae [1]". Benefit occurs when given "promptly before or simultaneously with the administration of antibiotics", and "Providers must therefore rapidly recognize the signs and symptoms of acute bacterial meningitis and treat empirically with steroids based on clinical suspicion prior to obtaining confirmatory CSF results".

### 2024 focused update: guidelines on use of corticosteroids in sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and community-acquired pneumonia [^112yQ37o]. Critical Care Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Special considerations in CAP — the panel was unable to make any statements on the use of corticosteroids in CAP in children based on the lack of randomized controlled trials, and the recommendation for bacterial CAP does not require microbiologic confirmation but refers to patients with high clinical suspicion for bacterial pneumonia treated with empiric antibiotics. Further, globally CAP has variable microbiology, thus it is uncertain if corticosteroid effects are generalizable to other etiologies of CAP.

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis update [^111dNShM]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Adult sinusitis — intranasal steroids for acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS): Intranasal steroids can be used alone, or in combination with oral antibiotics, for symptomatic relief of ABRS, with a Cochrane review reporting improvement or resolution in 54 per 100 with intranasal steroids versus 49 per 100 with placebo and statistical significance. Additional evidence found increased symptom improvement from 66% to 74% after 15 to 21 days (risk ratio 1.1, 95% CI 1.02–1.18) with aNNT of 11 across all doses. As adjunct therapy, adding fluticasone nasal spray to oral cefuroxime increased treatment success at 3 weeks from 74% to 93% in patients with a history of CRS or RARS, whereas another study in non-RARS found no benefits and likely included many with VRS given symptoms for less than 10 days (median of 7 days).

### Corticosteroids for treatment of sore throat: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised trials [^113PdqbD]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

In patients with acute sore throat, there is primarily moderate to high quality evidence that one or two low doses of corticosteroids reduces the intensity and duration of pain — pain scores at 24 hours, complete resolution of pain at 24 and at 48 hours, time to onset of pain relief, and time to complete pain relief. In this review, results were consistent across studies and across all pain outcomes (table 2). The reduction in pain achieved was modest — for example, mean time to complete resolution of pain was about 11 hours shorter, and about 18% more patients had complete pain relief at 48 hours. At 24 hours, the mean improvement in pain scores was about 13 mm on a visual analogue scale from 0 to 100 mm (with the minimal important difference being about 10 mm). The relative effects were similar across severities, though patients with less severe sore throat had less absolute benefit from corticosteroids. The balance of benefits and harms therefore almost certainly depends on the severity of the patient's sore throat.

Whether corticosteroids reduce recurrence/relapse of symptoms, number of days missed from school or work, duration of bad/intolerable symptoms, or antibiotic use remains uncertain. Regarding the safety of the short courses and low doses of corticosteroids, studies reported few adverse effects, with no apparent increase in events in patients treated with corticosteroid.

### Pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia, version 2.2025, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^111toQGw]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

Pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia — principles of supportive care: infection control addresses corticosteroid-related risks and initial fever management. Adrenal insufficiency is associated with steroid use, particularly in induction, and potential need for stress dose steroids with fevers; signs/symptoms of infection and sepsis, including fever, may be masked while on chronic corticosteroid therapy, and there should be a low threshold for admission, monitoring, and preemptive antibiotics for patients with ALL in phases with long-term corticosteroid treatment. During induction, all patients with fever (as defined by Infectious Diseases Society of America [IDSA]10 or institutional standards) should be evaluated by a medical provider and treated immediately with broad-spectrum antibiotics, regardless of absolute neutrophil count (ANC), whereas following completion of induction, antibiotics may not be indicated for fever based on clinical status. Note: All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.

### Effect of oral dexamethasone without immediate antibiotics vs placebo on acute sore throat in adults: a randomized clinical trial [^115Jhqxu]. JAMA (2017). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Acute sore throat poses a significant burden on primary care and is a source of inappropriate antibiotic prescribing. Corticosteroids could be an alternative symptomatic treatment.

Objective

To assess the clinical effectiveness of oral corticosteroids for acute sore throat in the absence of antibiotics.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized trial (April 2013-February 2015; 28-day follow-up completed April 2015) conducted in 42 family practices in South and West England, enrolled 576 adults recruited on the day of presentation to primary care with acute sore throat not requiring immediate antibiotic therapy.

Interventions

Single oral dose of 10 mg of dexamethasone (n = 293) or identical placebo (n = 283).

Main Outcomes and Measures

Primary: proportion of participants experiencing complete resolution of symptoms at 24 hours. Secondary: complete resolution at 48 hours, duration of moderately bad symptoms (based on a Likert scale, 0, normal; 6, as bad as it could be), visual analog symptom scales (0–100 mm; 0, no symptom to 100, worst imaginable), health care attendance, days missed from work or education, consumption of delayed antibiotics or other medications, adverse events.

Results

Among 565 eligible participants who were randomized (median age, 34 years [interquartile range, 26.0–45.5 year]; 75.2% women; 100% completed the intervention), 288 received dexamethasone; 277, placebo. At 24 hours, 65 participants (22.6%) in the dexamethasone group and 49 (17.7%) in the placebo group achieved complete resolution of symptoms, for a risk difference of 4.7% (95% CI, -1.8% to 11.2%) and a relative risk of 1.28 (95% CI; 0.92 to 1.78; p = 0.14). At 24 hours, participants receiving dexamethasone were not more likely than those receiving placebo to have complete symptom resolution. At 48 hours, 102 participants (35.4%) in the dexamethasone group vs 75 (27.1%) in the placebo group achieved complete resolution of symptoms, for a risk difference of 8.7% (95% CI, 1.2% to 16.2%) and a relative risk of 1.31 (95% CI, 1.02 to 1.68; p = 0.03). This difference also was observed in participants not offered delayed antibiotic prescription, for a risk difference of 10.3% (95% CI, 0.6% to 20.1%) and a relative risk of 1.37 (95% CI, 1.01 to 1.87; p = 0.046). There were no significant differences in any other secondary outcomes.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among adults presenting to primary care with acute sore throat, a single dose of oral dexamethasone compared with placebo did not increase the proportion of patients with resolution of symptoms at 24 hours. However, there was a significant difference at 48 hours.

### Clinical performance measures for neurocritical care: a statement for healthcare professionals from the Neurocritical Care Society [^114Eogbc]. Neurocritical Care (2020). High credibility.

Acute bacterial meningitis — adjunctive dexamethasone recommendations and dosing across cited guidelines are as follows: It is recommended that 10 mg dexamethasone IV 6 hourly should be started on admission, either shortly before or simultaneously with antibiotics, and it is recommended that if pneumococcal meningitis is confirmed, or thought probable based on clinical, epidemiological and CSF parameters, dexamethasone should be continued for 4 days, whereas it is recommended that if another cause of meningitis is confirmed, or thought probable, the dexamethasone should be stopped. Empiric treatment with dexamethasone is strongly recommended for all adults (10 mg QID for 4 days) and children (0.15 mg/kg QID for 4 days) with acute bacterial meningitis in the setting of high-income countries, and treatment with dexamethasone is strongly recommended to be initiated with the first dose of antibiotic treatment. Adjuvant dexamethasone is recommended with or shortly before the first parenteral dose of antibiotics in all previously well and non-immunosuppressed adults with pneumococcal meningitis at a dose of 10 mg every 6 hrs. for 4 days, while in acute bacterial meningitis because of other bacterial etiology, routine use of high dose dexamethasone is not clearly recommended. In adults with suspected or proven pneumococcal meningitis, the use of dexamethasone (0.15 mg/kg q 6 hrs. for 2–4 days with the first dose administered 10–20 min before, or at least concomitant with, the first dose of antimicrobial therapy) is recommended, and it is recommended that adjunctive dexamethasone should not be given to adult patients who have already received antimicrobial therapy. The use of corticosteroids in patients with bacterial meningitis is recommended.

### European Society of Endocrinology and endocrine society joint clinical guideline: diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^1144zn2F]. European Journal of Endocrinology (2024). High credibility.

Table 8 — minor stress during illness or outpatient antibiotics in patients at risk of or with glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency states that if the patient is already taking hydrocortisone ≥ 40 mg daily, prednisone ≥ 10 mg daily, or dexamethasone ≥ 1 mg daily, there is typically no need to increase the dose unless there are signs of hemodynamic instability, and otherwise suggests for those not on daily glucocorticoids to give hydrocortisone 40 mg total daily dose in three divided doses (eg, 20 mg on rising, 10 mg 12 midday, 10 mg 5pm) and to continue for 2–5 days until well (or for the duration of antibiotic treatment), with adjustments for current therapy such that if on hydrocortisone < 40 mg total daily dose increase to 40 mg total daily dose with the same schedule and if on prednisone < 10 mg total daily dose increase to 10 mg total daily dose in one or two divided doses and continue for 2–5 days until well.

### Steroids in adults with acute bacterial meningitis: a systematic review [^113CVTq9]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2004). Medium credibility.

Bacterial meningitis is uncommon but causes significant mortality and morbidity, despite optimum antibiotic therapy. A clinical trial in 301 patients showed a beneficial effect of adjunctive steroid treatment in adults with acute community-acquired pneumococcal meningitis, but data on other organisms or adverse events are sparse. This led us to do a quantitative systematic review of adjunctive steroid therapy in adults with acute bacterial meningitis. Five trials involving 623 patients were included (pneumococcal meningitis = 234, meningococcal meningitis = 232, others = 127, unknown = 30). Overall, treatment with steroids was associated with a significant reduction in mortality (relative risk 0.6, 95% CI 0.4–0.8, p = 0.002) and in neurological sequelae (0.6, 0.4–1, p = 0.05), and with a reduction of case-fatality in pneumococcal meningitis of 21% (0.5, 0.3–0.8, p = 0.001). In meningococcal meningitis, mortality (0.9, 0.3–2.1) and neurological sequelae (0.5, 0.1–1.7) were both reduced, but not significantly. Adverse events, recorded in 391 cases, were equally divided between the treatment and placebo groups (1, 0.5–2), with gastrointestinal bleeding in 1% of steroid-treated and 4% of other patients. Since treatment with steroids reduces both mortality and neurological sequelae in adults with bacterial meningitis, without detectable adverse effects, routine steroid therapy with the first dose of antibiotics is justified in most adult patients in whom acute community-acquired bacterial meningitis is suspected.

### Infections associated with steroid use [^117HWqfS]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

Patients receiving chronic steroids have an increased susceptibility to many different types of infections. The risk of infection is related to the dose of steroid and the duration of therapy. Although pyogenic bacteria are the most common pathogens, chronic steroid use increases the risk of infection with intracellular pathogens such as Listeria, many fungi, the herpes viruses, and certain parasites. Clinicians should consider both common and unusual opportunistic infections in patients receiving chronic steroids.

### Corticosteroids for treating sepsis in children and adults [^115V82mm]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Sepsis occurs when an infection is complicated by organ failure. Sepsis may be complicated by impaired corticosteroid metabolism. Thus, providing corticosteroids may benefit patients. The original review was published in 2004 and was updated in 2010 and 2015 prior to this update.

Objectives

To examine the effects of corticosteroids on death in children and adults with sepsis.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, ClinicalTrials.gov, ISRCTN, and the WHO Clinical Trials Search Portal, on 25 July 2019. In addition, we conducted reference checking and citation searching, and contacted study authors, to identify additional studies as needed.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of corticosteroids versus placebo or usual care (antimicrobials, fluid replacement, and vasopressor therapy as needed) in children and adults with sepsis. We also included RCTs of continuous infusion versus intermittent bolus of corticosteroids.

Data Collection and Analysis

All review authors screened and selected studies for inclusion. One review author extracted data, which was checked by the others, and by the lead author of the primary study when possible. We obtained unpublished data from the authors of some trials. We assessed the methodological quality of trials and applied GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence. Review authors did not contribute to assessment of eligibility and risk of bias, nor to data extraction, for trials they had participated in.

Main Results

We included 61 trials (12,192 participants), of which six included only children, two included children and adults, and the remaining trials included only adults. Nine studies are ongoing and will be considered in future versions of this review. We judged 19 trials as being at low risk of bias. Corticosteroids versus placebo or usual care Compared to placebo or usual care, corticosteroids probably slightly reduce 28-day mortality (risk ratio (RR) 0.91, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.84 to 0.99; 11,233 participants; 50 studies; moderate-certainty evidence). Corticosteroids may result in little to no difference in long-term mortality (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.03; 6236 participants; 7 studies; low-certainty evidence) and probably slightly reduce hospital mortality (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.82 to 0.99; 8183 participants; 26 trials; moderate-certainty evidence). Corticosteroids reduced length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay for all participants (mean difference (MD) -1.07 days, 95% CI -1.95 to -0.19; 7612 participants; 21 studies; high-certainty evidence) and resulted in a large reduction in length of hospital stay for all participants (MD -1.63 days, 95% CI -2.93 to -0.33; 8795 participants; 22 studies; high-certainty evidence). Corticosteroids increase the risk of muscle weakness (RR 1.21, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.44; 6145 participants; 6 studies; high-certainty evidence). Corticosteroids probably do not increase the risk of superinfection (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.19; 5356 participants; 25 studies; moderate-certainty evidence). Corticosteroids increase the risk of hypernatraemia (high-certainty evidence) and probably increase the risk of hyperglycaemia (moderate-certainty evidence). Moderate-certainty evidence shows that there is probably little or no difference in gastroduodenal bleeding, stroke, or cardiac events, and low-certainty evidence suggests that corticosteroids may result in little to no difference in neuropsychiatric events. Continuous infusion of corticosteroids versus intermittent bolus We are uncertain about the effects of continuous infusion of corticosteroids compared with intermittent bolus administration. Three studies reported data for this comparison, and the certainty of evidence for all outcomes was very low.

Authors' Conclusions

Moderate-certainty evidence indicates that corticosteroids probably reduce 28-day and hospital mortality among patients with sepsis. Corticosteroids result in large reductions in ICU and hospital length of stay (high-certainty evidence). There may be little or no difference in the risk of major complications; however, corticosteroids increase the risk of muscle weakness and hypernatraemia, and probably increase the risk of hyperglycaemia. The effects of continuous versus intermittent bolus administration of corticosteroids are uncertain.

### Pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia, version 2.2025, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^112B9ojF]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

Pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia — infection control specimen collection and empiric therapy emphasize timely evaluation and cultures. Perform a comprehensive assessment of patient for severity of illness (including signs and symptoms of shock) and localizing signs and symptoms of infection, and evaluate central venous line site for presence of infection. Every effort should be made to collect bacterial culture specimens before administration of antibiotics; however, empiric antibiotic therapy should NOT be delayed for the purposes of specimen collection only. For patients with signs of fever, neutropenia, or sepsis, antibiotics should be administered as soon as possible, and recommend stress dose steroids for patients with sepsis. Both aerobic and anaerobic blood cultures of appropriate volume (based on age and weight) should be collected based on institutional guidelines, and consider obtaining a urine culture in all febrile patients and infants, or in any patient with genitourinary symptoms or with a urinary catheter in place before empirical antibiotics are dispensed.

### Tobramycin and dexamethasone [^115VVHup]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

General: The possibility of fungal infections of the cornea should be considered after long-term steroid dosing. As with other antibiotic preparations, prolonged use may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms, including fungi. If superinfection occurs, appropriate therapy should be initiated. When multiple prescriptions are required, or whenever clinical judgement dictates, the patient should be examined with the aid of magnification, such as slit lamp biomicroscopy and, where appropriate, fluorescein staining.

Cross-sensitivity to other aminoglycoside antibiotics may occur; if hypersensitivity develops with this product, discontinue use and institute appropriate therapy.

Information for Patients: Do not touch dropper tip to any surface, as this may contaminate the contents. Contact lenses should not be worn during the use of this product.

Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility: No studies have been conducted to evaluate the carcinogenic or mutagenic potential. No impairment of fertility was noted in studies of subcutaneous tobramycin in rats at doses of 50 and 100 mg/kg/day.

Pregnancy: Corticosteroids have been found to be teratogenic in animal studies. Ocular administration of 0.1% dexamethasone resulted in 15.6% and 32.3% incidence of fetal anomalies in two groups of pregnant rabbits. Fetal growth retardation and increased mortality rates have been observed in rats with chronic dexamethasone therapy. Reproduction studies have been performed in rats and rabbits with tobramycin at doses up to 100 mg/kg/day parenterally and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus.

There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. However, prolonged or repeated corticoid use during pregnancy has been associated with an increased risk of intra-uterine growth retardation. Tobramycin and dexamethasone ophthalmic suspension should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Infants born of mothers who have received substantial doses of corticosteroids during pregnancy should be observed carefully for signs of hypoadrenalism.

Nursing Mothers: Systemically administered corticosteroids appear in human milk and could suppress growth, interfere with endogenous corticosteroid production, or cause other untoward effects. It is not known whether topical administration of corticosteroids could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when tobramycin and dexamethasone ophthalmic suspension is administered to a nursing woman.

Pediatric Use: Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 2 years have not been established.

### Corticosteroids for periorbital and orbital cellulitis [^111yakDY]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Periorbital and orbital cellulitis are infections of the tissue anterior and posterior to the orbital septum, respectively, and can be difficult to differentiate clinically. Periorbital cellulitis can also progress to become orbital cellulitis. Orbital cellulitis has a relatively high incidence in children and adults, and potentially serious consequences including vision loss, meningitis, and death. Complications occur in part due to inflammatory swelling from the infection creating a compartment syndrome within the bony orbit, leading to elevated ocular pressure and compression of vasculature and the optic nerve. Corticosteroids are used in other infections to reduce this inflammation and edema, but they can lead to immune suppression and worsening infection.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness and safety of adjunctive corticosteroids for periorbital and orbital cellulitis, and to assess their effectiveness and safety in children and in adults separately.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register) (2020, Issue 3); Ovid MEDLINE; Embase.com; PubMed; Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature Database (LILACS); ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic search for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 2 March 2020.

Selection Criteria

We included studies of participants diagnosed with periorbital or orbital cellulitis. We excluded studies that focused exclusively on participants who were undergoing elective endoscopic surgery, including management of infections postsurgery as well as studies conducted solely on trauma patients. Randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials were eligible for inclusion. Any study that administered corticosteroids was eligible regardless of type of steroid, route of administration, length of therapy, or timing of treatment. Comparators could include placebo, another corticosteroid, no treatment control, or another intervention.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures recommended by Cochrane.

Main Results

The search yielded 7998 records, of which 13 were selected for full-text screening. We identified one trial for inclusion. No other eligible ongoing or completed trials were identified. The included study compared the use of corticosteroids in addition to antibiotics to the use of antibiotics alone for the treatment of orbital cellulitis. The study included a total of 21 participants aged 10 years and older, of which 14 participants were randomized to corticosteroids and antibiotics and 7 participants to antibiotics alone. Participants randomized to corticosteroids and antibiotics received adjunctive corticosteroids after initial antibiotic response (mean 5.13 days), at an initial dose of 1.5 mg/kg for three days followed by 1 mg/kg for another three days before being tapered over a one- to two-week period. We assessed the included study as having an unclear risk of bias for allocation concealment, masking (blinding), selective outcome reporting, and other sources of bias. Risk of bias from sequence generation and incomplete outcome data were low. The certainty of evidence for all outcomes was very low, downgraded for risk of bias (-1) and imprecision (-2). Length of hospital stay was compared between the group receiving antibiotics alone compared to the group receiving antibiotics and corticosteroids (mean difference (MD) 4.30, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.48 to 9.08; 21 participants). There was no observed difference in duration of antibiotics between treatment groups (MD 3.00, 95% CI -0.48 to 6.48; 21 participants). Likewise, preservation of visual acuity at 12 weeks of follow-up between group was also assessed (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.22; 21 participants). Pain scores were compared between groups on day 3 (MD -0.20, 95% CI -1.02 to 0.62; 22 eyes) along with the need for surgical intervention (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.11 to 9.23; 21 participants). Exposure keratopathy was reported in five participants who received corticosteroids and antibiotics and three participants who received antibiotic alone (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.40 to 3.63; 21 participants). No major complications of orbital cellulitis were seen in either the intervention or the control group. No side effects of corticosteroids were reported, although it is unclear which side effects were assessed.

Authors' Conclusions

There is insufficient evidence to draw conclusions about the use of corticosteroids in the treatment of periorbital and orbital cellulitis. Since there is significant variation in how corticosteroids are used in clinical practice, additional high-quality evidence from randomized controlled trials is needed to inform decision making. Future studies should explore the effects of corticosteroids in children and adults separately, and evaluate different dosing and timing of corticosteroid therapy.

### Lessons are still being learned about intrapulmonary antibiotic concentrations [^117H1SYJ]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

What are the clinical implications of this well done analysis? Certainly, it seems reassuring to leap to the conclusion that, when treating pneumonia in patients with ARDS, one can presume that the lung concentrations of the prescribed antibiotics will be sufficiently high to treat the coexisting infection. However, readers must recall that in the study by Geilen and colleagues, no animal had pneumonia. They analyzed ALI in isolation from concurrent infection. At the bedside, however, often these processes exist concurrently. It is possible that some of the inflammatory cascades that appear to promote antibiotic lung penetration in ALI may be attenuated by the other forms and types of inflammation provoked in response to acute bacterial infection. Conversely, one should not overinterpret the results of Geilen and colleagues. Theoretically, one might worry about potentially impairing antibiotic lung penetration with the use of corticosteroids in ARDS. If this were the case, trials of corticosteroids in ARDS would reveal that those who developed or had underlying pneumonia would face worse outcomes. Such evidence, though, is lacking. In fact, corticosteroids in some forms of ARDS clearly improve mortality. Furthermore, when sepsis results in ARDS, the controversy revolves around whether corticosteroids offer a benefit and not whether such an approach worsens outcomes.

In conclusion, no matter which intrapulmonary measurement technique is used, relationships between antibiotic lung concentration and clinical outcome in patients with infections need to be established to determine optimal antibiotic dose selection. With a better appreciation of optimized antibiotic dosing and the recognition that it will likely vary from patient to patient, we can finally begin to move toward a more personalized medicine approach in the care of the critically ill.

### Do corticosteroids improve outcome in meningitis? [^114UP2Vq]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2010). Low credibility.

Despite significant advances in prevention of meningitis through vaccination, and in improved antimicrobial treatment, the disease still kills around 340,000 people worldwide each year.¹ Around 75% of these deaths occur in Africa and South East Asia and around 3% in Europe.¹ The mortality rate for bacterial meningitis is 10–30% and sequelae, such as cranial nerve impairment, particularly leading to hearing loss, occur in 5–40% of patients.² Whether adjunctive corticosteroid treatment improves the outcome in bacterial meningitis through an anti-inflammatory effect has been a long-standing controversy. Here we review the role of adjunctive corticosteroids in the management of children (aged over 1 month) and adults with bacterial or tuberculous meningitis.

### Early initiation of low-dose corticosteroid therapy in the management of septic shock: a retrospective observational study [^115sohSo]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

Definitions

Septic shock was defined as sepsis with acute circulatory failure characterized by persistent arterial hypotension (systolic arterial pressure < 90 mmHg in 156 patients (88%), mean arterial pressure < 60 mmHg in 147 (83%)], or a reduction in systolic blood pressure > 40 mmHg from baseline in 21 (12%)) despite adequate volume resuscitation. Organ dysfunction was defined as Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score ≥ 2 for each organ system. Critical-illness-related corticosteroid insufficiency (CIRCI) was diagnosed by a delta serum cortisol level of < 9 μg/dL after ACTH (250 μg) administration (relative adrenal insufficiency) or random total serum cortisol < 10 μg/dL. Appropriate antibiotic therapy was considered if the initially prescribed antibiotics were active against the identified pathogens, based on in vitro susceptibility testing. The time to initiation of antibiotic therapy relative to the onset of septic shock was defined as the time from the initial onset of septic shock-related hypotension to the initiation of antibiotics. Time to initiation of low-dose corticosteroid therapy was defined as the time from the initial onset of septic shock-related hypotension to the initiation of corticosteroid. Reversal of shock was defined as the maintenance of a systolic blood pressure of at least 90 mmHg without vasopressor support for at least 24 hours.

Data collection

The following data recorded at the time of initiation of low-dose corticosteroid therapy were collected from the electronic medical records: general characteristics of the patients including demographic data, infection source, laboratory measurements including initial lactate, amount of fluid administered before initiation of vasopressor, doses of vasopressor (norepinephrine or equivalent), and organ dysfunction. The severity of illness was assessed by Simplified Acute Physiology Score 3 (SAPS 3) and SOFA scores. SAPS 3 was calculated as the worst value for that variable during the first one hour of ICU admission, and SOFA scores were calculated from the data on admission. On ICU admission, the following conditions were evaluated: the need for mechanical ventilation and renal replacement therapy, appropriateness of empirical antibiotic therapy, and presence of bacteremia.

The primary outcome was 28-day mortality. To address the primary research question of whether mortality and time to initiation of low-dose steroid therapy are associated, we considered age, gender, time to initiation of antibiotic therapy and severity of illness as potential confounders. The secondary outcomes were reversal of shock, ICU mortality, in-hospital mortality and the duration of ICU and hospital stay.

### Antibiotics for the induction and maintenance of remission in ulcerative colitis [^117BUPAQ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Antibiotics have been considered to treat ulcerative colitis (UC) due to their antimicrobial properties against intestinal bacteria linked to inflammation. However, there are concerns about their efficacy and safety.

Objectives

To determine whether antibiotic therapy is safe and effective for the induction and maintenance of remission in people with UC.

Search Methods

We searched five electronic databases on 10 December 2021 for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing antibiotic therapy to placebo or an active comparator.

Selection Criteria

We considered people with UC of all ages, treated with antibiotics of any type, dose, and route of administration for inclusion. Induction studies required a minimum duration of two weeks for inclusion. Maintenance studies required a minimum duration of three months to be considered for inclusion.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Our primary outcome for induction studies was failure to achieve remission and for maintenance studies was relapse, as defined by the primary studies.

Main Results

We included 12 RCTs (847 participants). One maintenance of remission study used sole antibiotic therapy compared with 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA). All other trials used concurrent medications or standard care regimens and antibiotics as an adjunct therapy or compared antibiotics with other adjunct therapies to examine the effect on induction of remission. There is high certainty evidence that antibiotics (154/304 participants) compared to placebo (175/304 participants) result in no difference in failure to achieve clinical remission (risk ratio (RR) 0.88, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.74 to 1.06). A subgroup analysis found no differences when steroids, steroids plus 5-ASA, or steroids plus 5-ASA plus probiotics were used as additional therapies to antibiotics and placebo. There is low certainty evidence that antibiotics (102/168 participants) compared to placebo (121/175 participants) may result in no difference in failure to achieve clinical response (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.22). A subgroup analysis found no differences when steroids or steroids plus 5-ASA were used as additional therapies to antibiotics and placebo. There is low certainty evidence that antibiotics (6/342 participants) compared to placebo (5/349 participants) may result in no difference in serious adverse events (RR 1.19, 95% CI 0.38 to 3.71). A subgroup analysis found no differences when steroids were additional therapies to antibiotics and placebo. There is low certainty evidence that antibiotics (3/342 participants) compared to placebo (1/349 participants) may result in no difference in withdrawals due to adverse events (RR 2.06, 95% CI 0.27 to 15.72). A subgroup analysis found no differences when steroids or steroids plus 5-ASA were additional therapies to antibiotics and placebo. It is unclear if there is any difference between antibiotics in combination with probiotics compared to no treatment or placebo for failure to achieve clinical remission (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.19), serious adverse events (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.07 to 15.08), or withdrawals due to adverse events (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.07 to 15.08). The certainty of the evidence is very low. It is unclear if there is any difference between antibiotics compared to 5-ASA for failure to achieve clinical remission (RR 2.20, 95% CI 1.17 to 4.14). The certainty of the evidence is very low. It is unclear if there is any difference between antibiotics compared to probiotics for failure to achieve clinical remission (RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.94). The certainty of the evidence is very low. It is unclear if there is any difference between antibiotics compared to 5-ASA for failure to maintain clinical remission (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.06). The certainty of the evidence is very low. It is unclear if there is any difference between antibiotics compared to no treatment for failure to achieve clinical remission in a mixed population of people with active and inactive disease (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.29 to 1.07). The certainty of the evidence is very low. For all other outcomes, no effects could be estimated due to a lack of data.

Authors' Conclusions

There is high certainty evidence that there is no difference between antibiotics and placebo in the proportion of people who achieve clinical remission at the end of the intervention period. However, there is evidence that there may be a greater proportion of people who achieve clinical remission and probably a greater proportion who achieve clinical response with antibiotics when compared with placebo at 12 months. There may be no difference in serious adverse events or withdrawals due to adverse events between antibiotics and placebo. No clear conclusions can be drawn for any other comparisons. A clear direction for future research appears to be comparisons of antibiotics and placebo (in addition to standard therapies) with longer-term measurement of outcomes. Additionally. As there were single studies of other head-to-head comparisons, there may be scope for future studies in this area.

### Concomitant comedications and survival with first-line pembrolizumab in advanced non-small-cell lung cancer [^115iunMS]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Conclusions

In this cohort study of 41 529 patients treated with first line pembrolizumab for an advanced NSLSC, we confirmed the association of OS with exposure to antibiotics, PPIs, and steroids at the beginning of immunotherapy. Antibiotic prescription is mandatory in case of serious infection, but the choice of antibiotic could be oriented toward macrolide or penicillin, drugs without an association with survival. Steroid prescription, if administered at low dose, should not delay or prevent the start of immunotherapy because the dose-dependent negative association with survival was observed at higher dose. PPI prescription, outside of validated indications such as gastric ulcer, should not be proposed to patients with immunotherapy.

### Medical treatment of pouchitis: a guide for the clinician [^1128czsc]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Chronic inflammatory complications of the pouch

Antibiotics

After initial treatment for pouchitis, approximately 60% of patients will develop at least one recurrence and up to 20% will develop chronic pouchitis. Treatment will often start with the initiation of previously used antibiotics, often requiring repeated episodic courses of antibiotics or cycling of antibiotics. The use of combination antibiotics such as ciprofloxacin with metronidazole, ciprofloxacin and rifaximin, or ciprofloxacin and tinidazolehave been beneficial in open-label trials. Long-term maintenance with antibiotics may be required. Patients should be counseled regarding symptoms of antibiotic side effects, and the antibiotic should be discontinued if there are signs of toxicity.

For IPAA patients with pouchitis refractory to antibiotics, with contraindications to antibiotics such as intolerance or toxicity, or with recurrent Clostridioides difficile, alternative treatments for pouchitis should be considered (Table 1).

Steroids

In chronic antibiotic refractory pouchitis, steroids have been used as a second-line treatment for pouchitis. Gionchetti et al.demonstrated that treatment with oral budesonide at 9 mg daily for 8 weeks was effective in inducing remission in 75% of pouchitis patients refractory to antibiotics. Budesonide enemas 2 mg/100 mL at bedtime for 6 weeks have also been evaluated as an effective treatment for pouchitis, demonstrating similar improvement rates as metronidazole but with fewer side effects. Oral beclomethasone dipropionate 10 mg daily achieved 80% remission rates in chronic refractory pouchitis in a small cohort of 10 patients. As in ulcerative colitis, long-term use of steroids is not advised. However, a response to steroids suggests a potential role for steroid-sparing, anti-inflammatory treatments for chronic antibiotic refractory pouchitis.

Immunomodulators

Expert opinion suggests immunomodulators may play a role in the management of chronic antibiotic refractory pouchitis starting initially at doses of 50 mg/day with weight-based targets of 1.5 mg/kg/day for 6-mercaptopurine and 2.5 mg/kg/day for azathioprine. In eight patients with stricturing Crohn's-like disease or severe pouchitis, weight-based azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine led to resolution of symptoms.

### Epidemiology and outcome of severe pneumococcal pneumonia admitted to intensive care unit: a multicenter study [^111gvZGB]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

Low-dose steroids represent another controversial therapy in severe sepsis. Some studies suggest this treatment improves survival in critically ill patients with severe CAP. In contrast, others, such as Snijders et al. who compared the administration of corticosteroids plus antibiotics, vs. antibiotics alone in severe sepsis, reported no benefit with steroids. The low number of treated patients, the observational characteristics of our study and the variability of steroid use between the participating centres preclude drawing any conclusions. However, in the present study, low doses of steroids were associated with increased mortality in univariate analysis. With the findings of the Corticus study, low-dose steroids should be restricted to patients with refractory septic shock.

Association of β -lactamin and either a macrolide or a fluoroquinolone has been linked with a lower mortality in severe CAP. However, the clinical impact of such a combination is seriously debated, and may vary among pathogens. For S. pneumoniae, combined antibiotic therapy might be beneficial to treat undiagnosed co-infections, or through anti-inflammatory properties of macrolides. However, these data emerged essentially from retrospective or small prospective studies, and are challenged by several other reports as with our study, and will have to be confirmed in a multicentre randomized study. To date, the recommendation of dual antibiotherapy for S. pneumoniae CAP has not been endorsed by scientific societies.

Pneumococcal pneumonia occurred preferentially during autumn or winter. This phenomenon has already been described in non-critically ill patients, with a clear link to external temperature and concomitant respiratory viral infections. Here we report for the first time this seasonality in ICU pneumococcal CAP. Interestingly, the severity of pneumonia assessed by the mortality rate was not influenced by season.

We found that S. pneumoniae strains with diminished susceptibility to penicillin were involved in almost 40% of cases. This is consistent with the recent report from the French national reference centre for S. pneumoniae, which collects isolates from invasive pneumococcal diseases: the overall proportion of strains that are non-susceptible to penicillin decreased from 45% to 35% in adults between 2001 and 2006. Interestingly, we confirmed in this severe ICU population that penicillin resistance did not influence outcome, as previously described in less severe populations.

Many CMGs recommended the addition of vancomycin alternatively rifampicin if there is suspicion of reduced sensitivity to penicillin, except for neonates. However, the CMGs produced by IDSA (USA) and NICE (UK) gave different advice. The first recommended vancomycin to everyone except neonates (< 28 days old), whereas the CMG by NICE recommended vancomycin to all returning travellers or those with recent prolonged or multiple exposure to antibiotics within the past 3 months, to cover risk of penicillin-resistant strains of S. pneumoniae.

All CMGs focused on bacterial CNS infections recommended adjunctive corticosteroids therapy before or with first dose of antibiotics. Some recommended it up to a few hours, 4 h, 12 h or 24 h post-antibiotics. Four explicitly did not recommend steroids for patients with immunosuppression or for neonates. One CMG noted that corticosteroids in infants is controversial and only recommended for Hib meningitis. It was highlighted that corticosteroids can reduce inflammation and brain oedema and has in some studies shown benefits of reducing rates of complications and improving outcomes in patients with meningitis, but also that some studies have raised concerns about potential side effects.

In both adults and children, if CRS does not improve after 1 dose of tocilizumab, then steroids should be administered with a second dose of tocilizumab; if CRS does not improve after 2 doses of tocilizumab (and/or steroids), third-line agents including anakinra, siltuximab, and high-dose methylprednisolone should be considered. If CRS does not improve after tocilizumab and steroids, infections should be considered again, and if steroids are used in the management of CRS, rapid taper should be used once symptoms begin to improve.

### Steroids for bacterial meningitis in children? [^114rnqC1]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2007). Low credibility.

Meningitis is most likely in children under the age of 5 years, with a smaller peak in incidence in young adults aged 15–19 years. Following the incorporation of Haemophilus influenzae b (Hib) and group C meningococcus vaccines into the UK childhood immunisation schedule, the incidence of disease caused by these pathogens has declined. However, bacterial meningitis remains a severe illness that can cause death and, among survivors, morbidity (e.g. complications such as deafness, blindness, brain damage, loss of limbs). The role of corticosteroids in preventing such outcomes in bacterial meningitis has been widely researched over the last 40 years. Here we review the current evidence for the effectiveness and safety of corticosteroid use in the management of children with acute bacterial meningitis.

### Dexamethasone sodium phosphate [^112vb7wt]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Growth and development of infants and children on prolonged corticosteroid therapy should be carefully followed.

Patients who are on immunosuppressant doses of corticosteroids should be warned to avoid exposure to chickenpox or measles and, if exposed, to obtain medical advice.

Intra-articular injection of a corticosteroid may produce systemic as well as local effects.

Appropriate examination of any joint fluid present is necessary to exclude a septic process.

A marked increase in pain accompanied by local swelling, further restriction of joint motion, fever, and malaise are suggestive of septic arthritis. If this complication occurs and the diagnosis of sepsis is confirmed, appropriate antimicrobial therapy should be instituted.

Local injection of a steroid into a previously infected joint is to be avoided. Corticosteroids should not be injected into unstable joints.

Although controlled clinical trials have shown corticosteroids to be effective in speeding the resolution of acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis they do not show that they affect the ultimate outcome or natural history of the disease. The studies do show that relatively high doses of corticosteroids are necessary to demonstrate a significant effect. (See Dosage and Administration Section).

Since complications of treatment with glucocorticoids are dependent on the size of the dose and the duration of treatment a risk/benefit decision must be made in each individual case as to dose and duration of treatment and as to whether daily or intermittent therapy should be used.

### Corticosteroids for treating sepsis [^113tKS4r]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Sepsis occurs when an infection is complicated by organ failures as defined by a sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score of two or higher. Sepsis may be complicated by impaired corticosteroid metabolism. Giving corticosteroids may benefit patients. The original review was published in 2004 and was updated in 2010 and again in 2015.

Objectives

To examine the effects of corticosteroids on death at one month in patients with sepsis, and to examine whether dose and duration of corticosteroids influence patient response to this treatment.

Search Methods

We searched the Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2014, Issue 10), MEDLINE (October 2014), EMBASE (October 2014), Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS; October 2014) and reference lists of articles, and we contacted trial authors. The original searches were performed in August 2003 and in October 2009.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials of corticosteroids versus placebo or supportive treatment in patients with sepsis.

Data Collection and Analysis

All review authors agreed on the eligibility of trials. One review author extracted data, which were checked by the other review authors, and by the primary author of the paper when possible. We obtained some missing data from trial authors. We assessed the methodological quality of trials.

Main Results

We identified nine additional studies since the last update, for a total of 33 eligible trials (n = 4268 participants). Twenty-three of these 33 trials were at low risk of selection bias, 22 were at low risk of performance and detection bias, 27 were at low risk of attrition bias and 14 were at low risk of selective reporting. Corticosteroids reduced 28-day mortality (27 trials; n = 3176; risk ratio (RR) 0.87, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.76 to 1.00; P value = 0.05, random-effects model). The quality of evidence for this outcome was downgraded from high to low for imprecision (upper limit of 95% CI = 1) and for inconsistency (significant heterogeneity across trial results). Heterogeneity was related in part to the dosing strategy. Treatment with a long course of low-dose corticosteroids significantly reduced 28-day mortality (22 trials; RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.78 to 0.97; P value = 0.01, fixed-effect model). The quality of evidence was downgraded from high to moderate for inconsistency (owing to non-significant effects shown by one large trial). Corticosteroids also reduced mortality rate in the intensive care unit (13 trials; RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.00; P value = 0.04, random-effects model) and at the hospital (17 trials; RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.98; P value = 0.03, random-effects model). Quality of the evidence for in-hospital mortality was downgraded from high to moderate for inconsistency and imprecision (upper limit of 95% CI for RR approaching 1). Corticosteroids increased the proportion of shock reversal by day seven (12 trials; RR 1.31, 95% CI 1.14 to 1.51; P value = 0.0001) and by day 28 (seven trials; n = 1013; RR 1.11, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.21; P value = 0.01) and reduced the SOFA score by day seven (eight trials; mean difference (MD) -1.53, 95% CI -2.04 to -1.03; P value < 0.00001, random-effects model) and survivors' length of stay in the intensive care unit (10 trials; MD -2.19, 95% CI -3.93 to -0.46; P value = 0.01, fixed-effect model) without inducing gastroduodenal bleeding (19 trials; RR 1.24, 95% CI 0. 92 to 1.67; P value = 0.15, fixed-effect model), superinfection (19 trials; RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.20; P value = 0.81, fixed-effect model) or neuromuscular weakness (three trials; RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.21 to 1.88; P value = 0.40, fixed-effect model). Corticosteroid increased the risk of hyperglycaemia (13 trials; RR 1.26, 95% CI 1.16 to 1.37; P value < 0.00001, fixed-effect model) and hypernatraemia (three trials; RR 1.64, 95% CI 1.28 to 2.09; P value < 0.0001, fixed-effect model).

Authors' Conclusions

Overall, low-quality evidence indicates that corticosteroids reduce mortality among patients with sepsis. Moderate-quality evidence suggests that a long course of low-dose corticosteroids reduced 28-day mortality without inducing major complications and led to an increase in metabolic disorders.

### Adjunctive steroid therapy for managing pulmonary tuberculosis [^111eVTsF]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Tuberculosis causes approximately 8.6 million disease episodes and 1.3 million deaths worldwide per year. Although curable with standardized treatment, outcomes for some forms of tuberculosis are improved with adjunctive corticosteroid therapy. Whether corticosteroid therapy would be beneficial in treating people with pulmonary tuberculosis is unclear.

Objectives

To evaluate whether adjunctive corticosteroid therapy reduces mortality, accelerates clinical recovery or accelerates microbiological recovery in people with pulmonary tuberculosis.

Search Methods

We identified studies indexed from 1966 up to May 2014 by searching: Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group's trials register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE and LILACS using comparative search terms. We handsearched reference lists of all identified studies and previous reviews and contacted relevant researchers, organizations and companies to identify grey literature.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials and quasi-randomized control trials of recognized antimicrobial combination regimens and corticosteroid therapy of any dose or duration compared with either no corticosteroid therapy or placebo in people with pulmonary tuberculosis were included.

Data Collection and Analysis

At least two investigators independently assessed trial quality and collected data using pre-specified data extraction forms. Findings were reported as narrative or within tables. If appropriate, Mantel-Haenszel meta-analyses models were used to calculate risk ratios.

Main Results

We identified 18 trials, including 3816 participants, that met inclusion criteria. When compared to taking placebo or no steroid, corticosteroid use was not shown to to reduce all-cause mortality, or result in higher sputum conversion at 2 months or at 6 months (mortality: RR 0.77, 95%CI 0.51 to 1.15, 3815 participants, 18 studies, low quality evidence; sputum conversion at 2 months RR 1.03, 95%CI 0.97 to 1.09, 2750 participants, 12 studies; at 6 months; RR1.01, 95%CI 1.01, 95%CI 0.98 to 1.04, 2150 participants, 9 studies, both low quality evidence). However, corticosteroid use was found to increase weight gain (data not pooled, eight trials, 1203 participants, low quality evidence), decrease length of hospital stay (data not pooled, three trials, participants 379, very low quality of evidence) and increase clinical improvement within one month (RR 1.16, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.24; five trials, 497 participants, low quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

It is unlikely that adjunctive corticosteroid treatment provides major benefits for people with pulmonary tuberculosis. Short term clinical benefits found did not appear to be maintained in the long term. However, evidence available to date is of low quality. In order to evaluate whether adjunctive corticosteroids reduce mortality, or accelerate clinical or microbiological recovery in people with pulmonary tuberculosis further large randomized control trials sufficiently powered to detect changes in such outcomes are needed.

### Guidelines for the acute treatment of cerebral edema in neurocritical care patients [^111JvLS3]. Neurocritical Care (2020). High credibility.

Community-acquired bacterial meningitis — corticosteroid guidance and panel stance: prior guidelines included both adults and pediatrics and recommended dexamethasone in adults with suspected or proven Streptococcus pneumoniae meningitis and avoiding corticosteroids if antimicrobials had already been initiated (both with a GRADE-equivalent to strong recommendation, high-quality evidence); data were inadequate for unknown or non-pneumococcal pathogens, and the panel elected to recommend overall avoiding corticosteroids in this setting while acknowledging potential per-patient benefit.

### Guidelines for the acute treatment of cerebral edema in neurocritical care patients [^116PLeMk]. Neurocritical Care (2020). High credibility.

Community-acquired bacterial meningitis — corticosteroid evidence: One meta-analysis included 25 RCTs from 1963–2013 and reported no significant differences in mortality or neurological sequelae overall, although corticosteroid use significantly lowered rates of hearing loss, with adult-only analyses showing no difference in mortality and four studies demonstrating significantly lower hearing loss with corticosteroids compared to placebo. Another systematic review of RCTs published from 1963 to 2007 determined corticosteroids were not associated with decreased mortality overall, while subgroup analyses reported that corticosteroid treatment was associated with lower mortality in laboratory-proven meningitis, Streptococcus pneumoniae meningitis, and patients in high-resource areas, and analyses of high-quality randomized controlled trials showed decreased hearing loss. A meta-analysis using individual patient data from five trials published between 2002 and 2007 found no difference in mortality, neurological disability, or severe hearing loss. In an individual randomized trial, adult patients were randomized to dexamethasone 10 mg intravenous every 6 h for 4 days with the first dose 15–20 min prior to or with antibiotics, where dexamethasone improved GOS and decreased mortality but did not benefit other neurological sequelae including hearing.

### Factors associated with afebrile presentation and delayed defervescence of bacterial meningitis in children under 3 years of age: a multi-centre retrospective analysis [^112VrWSL]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Herein, the treatment regimens were reviewed and compared with the comprehensive and authoritative guideline ESCMID. The mean time from admission to antibiotic therapy was 1.0 days, indicating timely therapy administration on the day of admission. Furthermore, choice of antibiotic was acceptable in 61.0% of cases, and duration of administration was acceptable in 48.1%. However, compliance to guidelines for steroid administration was low (5.1%). The non-adherence to guideline management may be due to over-reliance on symptoms, such as fever (present in 79.5% of patients), or delayed treatment in some patients without laboratory test results. Although dexamethasone should be administered before the first dose of antibiotic therapy, it is often not feasible in settings where the first antibiotic dose may have been administered before referral to hospital according to Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) guidance. In addition, the relevant expert consensus in China currently only includes steroid hormones as part of symptomatic supportive treatment and not used as part of standardized treatment in clinical practice. Steroids are often given as symptomatic treatment according to changes in the child's condition. Notably, the variables of time to initial treatment and the normative application of steroids were included because they positively impact the condition as shown in previous studies. Besides, these high rates of inconsistency with guidelines are not the result of the lack of standardised diagnostic treatment across the multiple centres in this study, but rather the result of benchmarking our results against the latest international guidelines. The results of our analysis challenge clinicians in the region to familiarise themselves with international guidelines, to identify younger pediatric BM patient as early as possible, and to standardize the use of steroids to further improve the treatment of children with BM.

### Choosing wisely: the top-5 recommendations from the Italian panel of the national guidelines for the management of acute pharyngitis in children [^1125VWiP]. Clinical Therapeutics (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose

With the aim to reduce waste in the health care system and avoid risks associated with unnecessary treatment, the Italian Panel of the National Guidelines for the Management of Acute Pharyngitis in Children joined the Choosing Wisely initiative.

Methods

An ad hoc Choosing Wisely task force was selected to develop a candidate list of items for the top-5 list on pharyngitis medicine. Through a process of literature review and consensus, the final list of 5 items was chosen. Drafted recommendations were formulated and then reviewed by the task force members until a final consensus was reached.

Findings

The 5 recommendations approved are: blood exams should not be performed; antibiotics should not be administrated unless microbiologic confirmation of streptococcal infection has been carried out; if a throat culture is performed, susceptibility tests on isolates should not be executed; antibiotic course should not be shortened; because penicillin V is not available in Italy, amoxicillin (50 mg/kg/d in 2–3 doses orally) for 10 days is the first choice treatment; and steroids should not be administered for the risk of masking possible underlying severe condition.

Implications

This top-5 list can be a novel tool to spread the key messages of guidelines and to avoid unnecessary diagnostic procedures, and to promote a rational use of antibiotics in children.

### Glucocorticosteroids for sepsis: systematic review with meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis [^116MVEoz]. Intensive Care Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Methods

The systematic review was conducted following the recommendations of The Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions and reported according to the PRISMA statement. The protocol was published on PROSPERO (, ID: CRD42013005617).

In addition to an overall analysis including all doses, two separate analyses were conducted of high and low dose steroids. The cut-off value of high and low dose steroids was chosen arbitrarily. High doses were defined as daily doses of more than 500 mg hydrocortisone; low doses were defined as a daily intake of equal or less than 500 mg. Other steroids were recalculated into the equivalent hydrocortisone dose. When doses were expressed in milligram per kilogram body weight, doses were calculated assuming a body weight of 75 kg.

Eligibility criteria

Randomised clinical trials that included adult patients (age > 18 years) with SIRS, sepsis, severe sepsis or septic shock, or any combinations thereof (Table S1). Trials with patients with SIRS were excluded when SIRS criteria were not explicitly described in their methods section. Trials were also excluded when evaluating steroids for the prevention of the occurrence of SIRS. No limitations were made regarding underlying cause of illness. There were no restrictions on duration of treatment (days) or whether administration occurred continuously or intermittently. All types of steroids were included.

Trials were included independently of the type of control intervention: placebo, no intervention, or any other control intervention. Co-interventions were allowed provided that similar administration occurred in the intervention groups. Trials were included irrespective of chosen outcomes. No limitations were made on the basis of language or publication status. The following study types were excluded: quasi-randomised studies, observational studies, cross-over studies, and studies comparing different doses or different types of steroids in both trial intervention groups.

Search strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library, PubMed/Medline, Embase, Web of Science and Cinahl. We also hand-searched the reference lists of included trials and systematic reviews for further trials. Ongoing trials were sought through trial registries. No time restrictions were applied. The electronic literature search strategies are listed in Table S2.

### Drug insight: steroids in CNS infectious diseases – new indications for an old therapy [^116AzJgx]. Nature Clinical Practice: Neurology (2008). Medium credibility.

Infectious diseases of the CNS lead to overwhelming inflammatory processes within the brain and spinal cord that contribute substantially to patient morbidity and mortality. Pharmacological strategies to modulate inflammation have been investigated, although the resulting guidelines have sometimes been contradictory. Steroids have been proposed as adjunctive treatments for bacterial meningitis, tuberculous meningitis and herpes simplex virus encephalitis. Well-designed randomized controlled trials have established dexamethasone as an adjunctive therapy for adult patients receiving antibiotics for bacterial meningitis, and physicians prescribing the initial antibiotics need to be aware of current guidelines. Morbidity and mortality in patients with tuberculous meningitis exceeds 50%. Steroid treatments reduce mortality through an as yet unknown mechanism, although their effects on morbidity are less clear. Herpes simplex virus encephalitis is also associated with considerable morbidity and mortality. Despite a lack of randomized trials, there is some evidence that steroids used alongside antiviral therapy might be beneficial in this condition. As we discuss in this Review, systemic steroid treatment is an important aspect of treatment regimens for CNS infectious diseases, and the recent literature provides guidelines for the use of steroids in combination with appropriate antimicrobial therapy.

### Quality improvement in neurology: neurology outcomes quality measurement set [^117V4LMZ]. Neurology (2020). High credibility.

Neurology Outcomes Quality Measurement Set — scope, measure types, and example are described: The American Academy of Neurology (AAN) has released 13 quality measurement sets with over 139 individual measures, and "currently, only 14 of these developed measures are outcome or intermediate outcome measures". Many measures are process measures, defined as those that "focus on actions of health care professionals and whether these activities follow established evidence-based clinical guidelines, care protocols, and best practices", and for process measures "population characteristics do not factor into comparing one health care setting to another". An example from the 2017 AAN Inpatient and Emergency Care set specifies the "percentage of patients > 21 years of age in whom dexamethasone 10 mg is given IV before or with the first dose of antibiotics in suspected acute bacterial meningitis". The need for such quality efforts is underscored by the statement that "One in 6 Americans live with a neurologic disease" and by defining quality improvement as "systematic, data-guided activities designed to bring about immediate improvements in health care delivery" and "an intrinsic part of normal health care operations".

Educate on sick day rule 1 to double the routine oral glucocorticoid dose for fever/illness, antibiotics, or small procedures, and sick day rule 2 to inject a glucocorticoid im or iv for severe illness, trauma, persistent vomiting, fasting for procedures, or surgery. For acute management, use 100 mg hydrocortisone iv, im, or sc followed by 200 mg hydrocortisone per continuous iv infusion or repeated boluses every 6 h, and equip patients with an emergency kit with vials of 100 mg hydrocortisone sodium. Written instructions advise to inject 100 mg hydrocortisone immediately iv or im followed by continuous infusion of 200 mg/24 h, and education should be reinforced at least annually, or more frequently if needed.

### Unintended consequences: risk of opportunistic infections associated with long-term glucocorticoid therapies in adults [^112tQE9p]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Glucocorticoids are widespread anti-inflammatory medications used in medical practice. The immunosuppressive effects of systemic glucocorticoids and increased susceptibility to infections are widely appreciated. However, the dose-dependent model frequently used may not accurately predict the risk of infection in all patients treated with long-term glucocorticoids. In this review, we examine the risks of opportunistic infections (OIs) in patients requiring glucocorticoid therapy by evaluating the influence of the glucocorticoid dose, duration, and potency, combined with biological and host clinical factors and concomitant immunosuppressive therapy. We propose strategies to prevent OIs, which involve screening, antimicrobial prophylaxis, and immunizations. While this review focuses on patients with autoimmune, inflammatory, or neoplastic diseases, the potential risks and preventative strategies are likely applicable to other populations. Clinicians should actively assess the benefit-harm ratios of systemic glucocorticoids and implement preventive efforts to decrease their associated infections complications.

### Systemic corticosteroids for the treatment of COVID-19 [^1153b4ZV]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Systemic corticosteroids are used to treat people with COVID-19 because they counter hyper-inflammation. Existing evidence syntheses suggest a slight benefit on mortality. So far, systemic corticosteroids are one of the few treatment options for COVID-19. Nonetheless, size of effect, certainty of the evidence, optimal therapy regimen, and selection of patients who are likely to benefit most are factors that remain to be evaluated.

Objectives

To assess whether systemic corticosteroids are effective and safe in the treatment of people with COVID-19, and to keep up to date with the evolving evidence base using a living systematic review approach.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register (which includes PubMed, Embase, CENTRAL, ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO ICTRP, and medRxiv), Web of Science (Science Citation Index, Emerging Citation Index), and the WHO COVID-19 Global literature on coronavirus disease to identify completed and ongoing studies to 16 April 2021.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated systemic corticosteroids for people with COVID-19, irrespective of disease severity, participant age, gender or ethnicity. We included any type or dose of systemic corticosteroids. We included the following comparisons: systemic corticosteroids plus standard care versus standard care (plus/minus placebo), dose comparisons, timing comparisons (early versus late), different types of corticosteroids and systemic corticosteroids versus other active substances. We excluded studies that included populations with other coronavirus diseases (severe acute respiratory syndrome or Middle East respiratory syndrome), corticosteroids in combination with other active substances versus standard care, topical or inhaled corticosteroids, and corticosteroids for long-COVID treatment.

Data Collection and Analysis

We followed standard Cochrane methodology. To assess the risk of bias in included studies, we used the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' 2 tool for RCTs. We rated the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach for the following outcomes: all-cause mortality, ventilator-free days, new need for invasive mechanical ventilation, quality of life, serious adverse events, adverse events, and hospital-acquired infections.

Main Results

We included 11 RCTs in 8075 participants, of whom 7041 (87%) originated from high-income countries. A total of 3072 participants were randomised to corticosteroid arms and the majority received dexamethasone (n = 2322). We also identified 42 ongoing studies and 16 studies reported as being completed or terminated in a study registry, but without results yet. Hospitalised individuals with a confirmed or suspected diagnosis of symptomatic COVID-19 Systemic corticosteroids plus standard care versus standard care plus/minus placebo We included 10 RCTs (7989 participants), one of which did not report any of our pre-specified outcomes and thus our analysis included outcome data from nine studies. All-cause mortality (at longest follow-up available): systemic corticosteroids plus standard care probably reduce all-cause mortality slightly in people with COVID-19 compared to standard care alone (median 28 days: risk difference of 30 in 1000 participants fewer than the control group rate of 275 in 1000 participants; risk ratio (RR) 0.89, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.80 to 1.00; 9 RCTs, 7930 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Ventilator-free days: corticosteroids may increase ventilator-free days (MD 2.6 days more than control group rate of 4 days, 95% CI 0.67 to 4.53; 1 RCT, 299 participants; low-certainty evidence). Ventilator-free days have inherent limitations as a composite endpoint and should be interpreted with caution. New need for invasive ventilation: the evidence is of very low certainty. Because of high risk of bias arising from deaths that occurred before ventilation we are uncertain about the size and direction of the effects. Consequently, we did not perform analysis beyond the presentation of descriptive statistics. Quality of life/neurological outcome: no data were available. Serious adverse events: we included data on two RCTs (678 participants) that evaluated systemic corticosteroids compared to standard care (plus/minus placebo); for adverse events and hospital-acquired infections, we included data on five RCTs (660 participants). Because of high risk of bias, heterogeneous definitions, and underreporting we are uncertain about the size and direction of the effects. Consequently, we did not perform analysis beyond the presentation of descriptive statistics (very low-certainty evidence). Different types, dosages or timing of systemic corticosteroids We identified one study that compared methylprednisolone with dexamethasone. The evidence for mortality and new need for invasive mechanical ventilation is very low certainty due to the small number of participants (n = 86). No data were available for the other outcomes. We did not identify comparisons of different dosages or timing. Outpatients with asymptomatic or mild disease Currently, there are no studies published in populations with asymptomatic infection or mild disease.

Authors' Conclusions

Moderate-certainty evidence shows that systemic corticosteroids probably slightly reduce all-cause mortality in people hospitalised because of symptomatic COVID-19. Low-certainty evidence suggests that there may also be a reduction in ventilator-free days. Since we are unable to adjust for the impact of early death on subsequent endpoints, the findings for ventilation outcomes and harms have limited applicability to inform treatment decisions. Currently, there is no evidence for asymptomatic or mild disease (non-hospitalised participants). There is an urgent need for good-quality evidence for specific subgroups of disease severity, for which we propose level of respiratory support at randomisation. This applies to the comparison or subgroups of different types and doses of corticosteroids, too. Outcomes apart from mortality should be measured and analysed appropriately taking into account confounding through death if applicable. We identified 42 ongoing and 16 completed but not published RCTs in trials registries suggesting possible changes of effect estimates and certainty of the evidence in the future. Most ongoing studies target people who need respiratory support at baseline. With the living approach of this review, we will continue to update our search and include eligible trials and published data.

### Prednisolone [^115wu6tu]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

WARNINGS

In patients on corticosteroid therapy subjected to unusual stress, increased dosage of rapidly acting corticosteroids before, during, and after the stressful situation is indicated.

Immunosuppression and Increased Risk of Infection

Corticosteroids, including Prednisolone Oral Solution USP, suppress the immune system and increase the risk of infection with any pathogen, including viral, bacterial, fungal, protozoan, or helminthic pathogens. Corticosteroids can:

Reduce resistance to new infections
Exacerbate existing infections
Increase the risk of disseminated infections
Increase the risk of reactivation or exacerbation of latent infections
Mask some signs of infection

Corticosteroid-associated infections can be mild but can be severe and at times fatal. The rate of infectious complications increases with increasing corticosteroid dosages.

Monitor for the development of infection and consider Prednisolone Oral Solution USP withdrawal or dosage reduction as needed.

Do not administer Prednisolone Oral Solution USP by an intraarticular, intrabursal, intratendinous, or intralesional route in the presence of acute local infection.

Tuberculosis

Prednisolone Oral Solution USP is used to treat a condition in patients with latent tuberculosis or tuberculin reactivity, reactivation of tuberculosis may occur. Closely monitor such patients for reactivation. During prolonged Prednisolone Oral Solution USP therapy, patients with latent tuberculosis or tuberculin reactivity should receive chemoprophylaxis.

### Infection risk and safety of corticosteroid use [^112mvgQf]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Corticosteroids are frequently used to treat rheumatic diseases. Their use comes with several well-established risks, including osteoporosis, avascular necrosis, glaucoma, and diabetes. The risk of infection is of utmost concern and is well documented, although randomized controlled trials of short-term and lower-dose steroids have generally shown little or no increased risk. Observational studies from the real world, however, have consistently shown dose-dependent increases in risk for serious infections as well as certain opportunistic infections. In patients who begin chronic steroid therapy, vaccination and screening strategies should be used in an attempt to mitigate this risk.

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis update [^113SePcz]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) patient information — symptom course, watchful waiting, and antibiotics: Most patients with ABRS feel better within 7 days and by 15 days about 90% are cured or improved. Watchful waiting means delaying antibiotic treatment of ABRS for up to 5 days after diagnosis, with a prescription to be filled only if not better after 5 days or if worse at any time. Both watchful waiting and antibiotic therapy are proven ways to treat ABRS, and antibiotics only slightly increase symptom relief with about 10–15 people must use antibiotics to get 1 more person better after 7–15 days; antibiotics have side effects including rash, upset stomach, nausea, vomiting, allergic reactions, and causing resistant germs. If antibiotics are used, they are usually given for 10 days; ask your doctor about a 5–7 day course of antibiotics since side effects are less common. For symptomatic relief, nasal steroid sprays can reduce symptoms after 15 days of use but the benefit is small (about 14 people must use them to get 1 person better), decongestant nasal sprays should be used for no more than 3 days in a row, and antihistamines and oral steroid medicines should not be used routinely.

### Treatment of bacterial meningitis: an overview of cochrane systematic reviews [^1118vUtU]. Respiratory Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Acute bacterial meningitis (ABM) is a rapidly developing acute inflammation of leptomeninges and underlying subarachnoid cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). ABM is caused by bacteria and has a case fatality rate of 20–30%. Most prevalent causes of ABM are Neisseria meningitis, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. The aim of this paper is to summarize the main findings from Cochrane systematic reviews that have considered the evidence for treatments of ABM.

Methods

We searched the Cochrane Library (issue 1, 2007) for relevant reviews using 'meningitis' as a search term. The titles of all the search results were examined to select reviews on treatment of ABM. The full text of each of the selected reviews was studied to summarize the evidence available in Cochrane systematic reviews.

Results

We found three Cochrane reviews that focused specifically on the treatment of ABM, addressing empiric antibiotic therapy, fluid therapy and effects of adjuvant corticosteroids respectively. No statistically significant difference was found between third generation cephalosporins and conventional antibiotics in the combined endpoint of death or deafness (risk difference (RD) -1%, 95% CI -4% to +2%). However, culture positivity of CSF at 10–48 h was significantly higher in the conventional antibiotic group and diarrhoea was significantly more common in the cephalosporin group. When third generation cephalosporins are not available, ampicillin-chloramphenicol combination may be used as an alternative empiric treatment, however both resistance pattern as well as availability should be considered while prescribing empiric therapy of community acquired ABM. The fluid therapy review found too few studies to provide any robust conclusion. In settings with high mortality rates and where patients present late, use of intravenous maintenance fluids seems preferable to a restricted fluid intake. The efficacy of adjuvant corticosteroids varied between high- and low-income countries suggesting greater mortality reduction in high-income countries (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.52–1.05) than in low-income countries (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.72–1.05) and a beneficial effect on severe hearing loss in high-income countries (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.18–0.57), whereas, sparse data in low-income countries (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.66–1.63). A four-day regimen of dexamethasone should be given preferably before or with the first dose of antibiotics for cases of ABM from high-income countries.

Conclusion

In presence of sensitive organisms, third generation cephalosporins and conventional antibiotics lead to similar outcomes. More studies are needed to determine the antimicrobial resistance pattern against various antibiotics in rural and remote areas of developing as well as developed countries. To assess the effectiveness of either restricting or maintenance fluids in populations where patients present early and on death and disability when mortality rates are low, large trials should be conducted. More trials are needed to assess the use of adjuvant dexamethasone for ABM in low-income countries.

### Pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia, version 2.2025, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^113UDfEC]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

Pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) — supportive care for Down syndrome and infants during myelosuppression includes inpatient monitoring, infection prophylaxis, and neutropenic fever management. During times of profound myelosuppression, monitoring in the hospital is strongly recommended until afebrile, clinically stable, and showing signs of bone marrow recovery. During periods of myelosuppression, consider antibacterial prophylaxis against Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms and consider antifungal prophylaxis; use caution with azoles given with vincristine and recommend infectious disease collaboration if considering antimicrobial and/or antifungal prophylaxis in infants. Monitor IgG levels monthly and recommend IVIG replacement for levels < 400 mg/dL or levels below the lower limit of normal for age. Manage neutropenic fever with hospitalization, blood cultures, and immediate broad-spectrum IV antibiotics covering both Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms; empiric Gram-positive coverage should include an antibiotic appropriate for the treatment of viridans streptococci and both Gram-positive and Gram-negative coverage should be adjusted for local resistance. During neutropenic fever, strongly consider antifungal therapy in the absence of clinical response to antibiotics after 3–5 days. In patients with neutropenic fever who are very ill or who lack response to antibiotic/antifungal therapy, consider stress dose steroids and consider filgrastim (G-CSF). All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.

### Efficacy of anti-inflammatory or antibiotic treatment in patients with non-complicated acute bronchitis and discoloured sputum: randomised placebo controlled trial [^112nYWtF]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Some studies have evaluated the efficacy of inhaled steroids in patients with cough lasting three weeks or longer. One randomised clinical trial showed a small effect on cough severity in patients taking fluticasone in the second week of disease, but this favourable effect was only detectable in non-smokers. In another study, budesonide taken for four weeks did not reduce cough scores compared with placebo in patients coughing for three weeks or longer after an upper respiratory tract infection. Two other studies evaluated the effect of inhaled beclomethasone dipropionate on cough score in patients with post-infectious acute cough (less than three weeks' duration). In one of the studies treatment with inhaled steroid resulted in a greater reduction of cough frequency than placebo, but in the other study there was no benefit. In a Cochrane review published recently, in which eight clinical trials were included with a total of 570 patients with subacute or chronic cough, inhaled corticosteroids resulted in a slight decrease in cough score, but data about its duration were not available.

A dose effect cannot be ruled out since the two trials that detected benefits used high dose inhaled steroids (fluticasone diproprionate 500 µg twice daily and beclomethasone dipropionate 400 µg twice daily), whereas the trial where no benefit was observed used a medium level dose of beclomethasone (100 µg four times daily.). In our clinical trial, the possibility of a type II error cannot be discarded, since no statistically significant differences were observed on cough duration with the usual dose of ibuprofen (600 mg three times daily) compared with antibiotic therapy or placebo, but the percentage of adverse events was statistically lower than in the antibiotic arm. Whether the use of higher doses of ibuprofen or other stronger non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs would have resulted in statistically significant reduction of cough duration compared with the other arms for patients with uncomplicated acute bronchitis remains unanswered, but it should be weighed against the possibility of more serious side effects.

Conclusions

Cough is the most common symptom reported by patients with lower respiratory tract infections. To the best of our knowledge, the present randomised clinical trial is the first study to show that an oral anti-inflammatory treatment or an antibiotic are not more effective than placebo for shortening the duration of cough in patients with otherwise non-complicated acute bronchitis with discoloured sputum. These results have important implications for the daily clinical practice of doctors.

### Severe acute respiratory syndrome: clinical outcome and prognostic correlates [^112ow3Dz]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

The recommended treatment regime at the time of the Amoy Gardens outbreak consisted of antibiotics, ribavirin, and steroid combination therapy. Patients without known epidemiologic contact with SARS patients were treated with antibiotics that would prevent both community- acquired pneumonia and hospital infections. If patients did not respond to antibiotics in 48 h, they would be given a combination of ribavirin and steroid. For patients with an epidemiologic history of contact with a SARS patient, this combination would be started together with the above antibiotic. Ribavirin would be given at a dose of 8 mg/kg intravenously every 8 h. For patients who appeared for treatment with extensive pneumonitis, a loading dose of 33 mg/kg of ribavirin, followed by 20 mg/kg every 8 h, was given intravenously. Hydrocortisone, 2 mg/kg every 6 h or 4 mg/kg every 8 h, would be administered, together with ribavirin. Oral equivalent doses of ribavirin and prednisolone could be prescribed at any stage of the disease. The total duration of therapy could range from 14 to 21 days. Besides administering steroids, we have tried in selected cases immunomodulation through the use of intravenous pentaglobin. Pulsed doses of methylprednisolone were restricted to those with disease progression and marked lung involvement. Lee et al. have made a comprehensive report of 138 cases of suspected SARS during a hospital outbreak in Hong Kong. Our study investigated the SARS patients after the Amoy Gardens outbreak to identify associated pretreatment prognostic factors for risk stratification and assess the clinical outcome of SARS under a standardized treatment protocol.

### Corticosteroids for septic arthritis in children [^116dDPUY]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Septic arthritis is an acute infection of the joints characterised by erosive disruption of the articular space. It is the most common non-degenerative articular disease in developing countries. The most vulnerable population for septic arthritis includes infants and preschoolers, especially boys. Septic arthritis disproportionately affects populations of low socioeconomic status. Systemic corticosteroids and antibiotic therapy may be beneficial for treatment of septic arthritis. Even if the joint infection is eradicated by antibiotic treatment, the inflammatory process may produce residual joint damage and sequelae.

Objectives

To determine the benefits and harms of corticosteroids as adjunctive therapy in children with a diagnosis of septic arthritis.

Search Methods

We searched MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), in the Cochrane Library, Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS), the World Health Organization (WHO) trials portal (www.who.int/ictrp/en/), ClinicalTrials.gov (www. ClinicalTrials.gov), and Google Scholar. We searched all databases from their inception to 17 April 2018, with no restrictions on language of publication.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with patients from two months to 18 years of age with a diagnosis of septic arthritis who were receiving corticosteroids in addition to antibiotic therapy or as an adjuvant to other therapies such as surgical drainage, intra-articular puncture, arthroscopic irrigation, or debridement.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed eligibility, data extraction, and evaluation of risk of bias. We considered as major outcomes the presence of pain, activities of daily living, normal physical joint function, days of antibiotic treatment, length of hospital stay, and numbers of total and serious adverse events. We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. We assessed the evidence using GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) and created a 'Summary of findings' table.

Main Results

We included two RCTs involving a total of 149 children between three months and 18 years of age who were receiving antibiotics for septic arthritis. The most commonly affected joints were hips and knees. These studies were performed in Costa Rica and Israel. In both studies, dexamethasone administered intravenously (ranging from 0.15 to 0.2 mg/kg/dose every six to eight hours) during four days was the corticosteroid, and the comparator was placebo. Trials excluded patients with any degree of immunodeficiency or immunosuppression. The longest follow-up was one year. Trials did not report activities of daily living nor length of hospital stay. Both studies used adequate processes for randomisation, allocation concealment, and blinding, and review authors judged them to have low risk of selection and performance bias. Losses to follow-up were substantive in both studies, and we judged them to have high risk of attrition bias and of selective outcome reporting. We graded all outcomes as low quality due to concerns about study limitations and imprecision. The risk ratio (RR) for absence of pain at 12 months of follow-up was 1.33, favouring corticosteroids (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.03 to 1.72; P = 0.03; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) = 13, 95% CI 6 to 139; absolute risk difference 24%, 95% CI 5% to 43%). The RR for normal function of the affected joint at 12 months of follow-up was 1.32, favouring corticosteroids (95% CI 1.12 to 1.57; P = 0.001; NNTB = 13, 95% CI 7 to 33; absolute risk difference 24%, 95% CI 11% to 37%). We found a reduction in the number of days of intravenous antibiotic treatment favouring corticosteroids (mean difference (MD) -2.77, 95% CI -4.16 to -1.39) based on two trials with 149 participants. Researchers did not report length of hospital stay. One trial (49 participants) reported that treatment with dexamethasone was associated with a shorter duration of IV antibiotic treatment, leading to a shorter hospital stay, and although duration of hospitalisation was a primary outcome of the study, study authors did not provide data on the duration of hospitalisation. We downgraded the quality by one level for concerns about study limitations (high risk of attrition bias and selective reporting), and by another level for imprecision. In one trial of 49 participants, researchers followed 29 children for 12 months, and parents reported that no children demonstrated adverse effects of the intervention.

Authors' Conclusions

Evidence for corticosteroids as adjunctive therapy in children with a diagnosis of septic arthritis is of low quality and is derived from the findings of two trials (N = 149). Corticosteroids may increase the proportion of patients without pain and the proportion of patients with normal function of the affected joint at 12 months, and may also reduce the number of days of antibiotic treatment. However, we cannot draw strong conclusions based upon these trial results. Additional randomised clinical trials in children with relevant outcomes are needed.

3.12.1 Corticosteroid therapy for ASUC

Statement 17. We recommend that patients with ASUC should be treated with high-dose intravenous corticosteroids such as methylprednisolone 60 mg daily or hydrocortisone 100 mg 6-hourly (GRADE: strong recommendation, high-quality evidence) and should receive prophylactic low-molecular weight heparin (GRADE: strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence. Agreement: 97.8%).

Intravenous corticosteroids such as hydrocortisone 100 mg four times daily or methylprednisolone 60 mg every 24 hours are the cornerstone of treatment of ASUC. Methylprednisolone has less mineralocorticoid effect than hydrocortisone at these doses and so causes significantly less hypokalaemia. There is no real advantage from giving higher doses and a bolus injection is as effective as a continuous infusion. Although a meta-regression analysis failed to show a relationship between dose and colectomy rate above the equivalent of 60 mg methylprednisolone,400 mg hydrocortisone is equivalent to 80 mg methylprednisolone. In children and adolescents, a dose of 1–1.5 mg/kg/day up to a maximum of 60 mg is recommended.

In the landmark study by Truelove and Witts, oral cortisone 100 mg daily was given to 213 patients with acute flares of varying severity. Clinical remission was achieved in 41% of steroid treated patients versus 16% on placebo. In a subsequent study, 49 patients with severe UC were treated with intravenous prednisolone 21-phosphate and a clinical remission rate of 73% was noted 5 days after treatment. Definitions and terms differed widely in these studies compared with outcome measures in use today. A systematic review of 32 trials of steroid therapy for ASUC involving 1991 patients reported an overall response to steroids of 67%, with 29% (95% CI 28% to 31%) having colectomy. Mortality was 1% (n = 22/1991; 95% CI 0.7% to 1.6%) and none of these outcomes changed between 1974 and 2006 (R 2 = 0.07, p = 0.8). In the CONSTRUCT cohort, after excluding those with infections or alternative diagnoses, response rate to intravenous steroids was 49%. Extending therapy beyond 7–10 days carries no additional benefit and increases toxicity. Patients should be assessed for a clinical and biochemical response after 3 days of intravenous steroid therapy to determine the need for salvage medical or surgical therapy.

### Severe listeriosis in intensive care units: insights from a retrospective multicentric study [^112FhwBd]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Limitations

Our study has several limitations. Firstly, its retrospective design introduces potential biases inherent to observational studies. Secondly, the sample size, particularly for subgroup analyses, limits statistical power and may explain why some findings, such as the borderline significance of steroid use, did not reach statistical significance. Thirdly, variability in the timing and dosing of dexamethasone across centers may have influenced outcomes. Unlike the strict protocol in Brouwer et al. our study did not control for timing relative to antibiotic administration, a critical factor in steroid efficacy. Additionally, while we adjusted for key variables such as Glasgow Coma Scale score and immunocompromised state, other potential confounders, like infection severity at presentation and adequacy of initial antibiotic therapy, were not fully accounted for, leading to possible residual confounding. Furthermore, our study did not systematically collect data on antibiotic dosing, limiting our ability to assess the potential impact of augmented renal clearance in septic critically ill patients. Given the known challenges of aminoglycoside and beta-lactam penetration into the central nervous system, even in the presence of meningeal inflammation, variations in amoxicillin dosing may have influenced outcomes. Lastly, outcomes were assessed only at hospital discharge, unlike the three-month follow-up in MONALISA, potentially missing late complications and long-term neurological outcomes. Due to the retrospective design and ICU-focused approach, systematic follow-up after discharge was not feasible, limiting our ability to assess functional recovery. Despite these limitations, our findings provide valuable insights into the management of severe Listeria infections but should be interpreted cautiously. Prospective, randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm the role of dexamethasone in neurolisteriosis. In the meantime, clinicians should base treatment decisions on current evidence, guidelines, and patient-specific factors.

### Dexamethasone in adults with bacterial meningitis [^116acjGc]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2002). Excellent credibility.

Background

Mortality and morbidity rates are high among adults with acute bacterial meningitis, especially those with pneumococcal meningitis. In studies of bacterial meningitis in animals, adjuvant treatment with corticosteroids has beneficial effects.

Methods

We conducted a prospective, randomized, double-blind, multicenter trial of adjuvant treatment with dexamethasone, as compared with placebo, in adults with acute bacterial meningitis. Dexamethasone (10 mg) or placebo was administered 15 to 20 minutes before or with the first dose of antibiotic and was given every 6 hours for four days. The primary outcome measure was the score on the Glasgow Outcome Scale at eight weeks (a score of 5, indicating a favorable outcome, vs. a score of 1 to 4, indicating an unfavorable outcome). A subgroup analysis according to the causative organism was performed. Analyses were performed on an intention-to-treat basis.

Results

A total of 301 patients were randomly assigned to a treatment group: 157 to the dexamethasone group and 144 to the placebo group. The base-line characteristics of the two groups were similar. Treatment with dexamethasone was associated with a reduction in the risk of an unfavorable outcome (relative risk, 0.59; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.37 to 0.94; P = 0.03). Treatment with dexamethasone was also associated with a reduction in mortality (relative risk of death, 0.48; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.24 to 0.96; P = 0.04). Among the patients with pneumococcal meningitis, there were unfavorable outcomes in 26 percent of the dexamethasone group, as compared with 52 percent of the placebo group (relative risk, 0.50; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.30 to 0.83; P = 0.006). Gastrointestinal bleeding occurred in two patients in the dexamethasone group and in five patients in the placebo group.

Conclusions

Early treatment with dexamethasone improves the outcome in adults with acute bacterial meningitis and does not increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.

### Short courses of oral corticosteroids: lack of benefit and… [^115htuN9]. AAFP (2018). Low credibility.

Primary care physicians generally agree that we should be more thoughtful and selective about the use of antibiotics in patients with upper and lower respiratory tract infections, and about the use of opioids for conditions such as back pain. However, prescriptions for antibiotics remain common in patients with acute respiratory infections. 1 Patients are increasingly seeking care for acute infections at urgent care centers, which prescribe antibiotics for respiratory infections more often than primary care practices. 1 Physicians also commonly prescribe short courses of oral corticosteroids, with one study finding the most common indication to be acute respiratory tract infection.
2. Meta-analyses have suggested that corticosteroids may have a small benefit for acute cough and sore throat, but they included studies that were small or had a high risk of bias. 3, 4 The best evidence comes from several well-designed and adequately powered randomized trials.

In the first, 565 children in the United Kingdom with mild to moderate sore throat were randomized to oral dexamethasone, 10 mg, or placebo. 5 The only benefit was a small reduction in symptoms at two days, but no improvements at other times or for other outcomes. The authors' overall assessment was that this small benefit was not worth the potential harm. Regarding cough, a recent trial identified 401 adults with acute cough but no history of asthma, and randomized them to prednisolone, 40 mg once daily, or placebo. 6 The researchers found no clinically significant difference between groups in cough severity or duration, antibiotic use, peak flow rates, or patient satisfaction. 2 Linking pharmacy records with new diagnoses, the authors found that 21% of patients received a short course of a systemic corticosteroid during the study period, and one-half received a six-day course of methylprednisolone.

The median dose was 20 mg of prednisone, and the most common indications were respiratory infection, back or neck pain, and allergies. A short course of oral corticosteroids is appropriate for many patients with acute exacerbation of asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and for selected patients with peritonsillar abscess, 8 severe pharyngitis, 9 and community-acquired pneumonia requiring hospitalization. 10, 11 However, widespread use of corticosteroids in patients with non-pneumonia lower respiratory tract infection, nonsevere sore throat, or low back pain is inappropriate and not worth the risk of rare but potentially serious harms.

### Steroids beneficial as adjunctive treatment for community… [^1166r9US]. AAFP (2016). Low credibility.

Clinical Question Should steroids be used as adjunctive therapy for patients with community-acquired pneumonia. Bottom Line Moderate-quality to high-quality evidence suggests that steroids, when added to antibiotics and usual care, can improve outcomes in the treatment of CAP. Benefits include reduced hospital length of stay, decreased time to clinical stability, and lower rates of mechanical ventilation and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Steroids may also play a role in preventing deaths, especially in patients with severe CAP; however, the certainty of this evidence is not as clear. Given varying treatment regimens used in the individual studies, the appropriate steroid formulation, dosage, and duration of steroids cannot be elucidated from the current set of data.

Synopsis These authors searched Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Register to find randomized controlled trials that compared the use of steroids with placebo in adults with CAP. Two reviewers independently evaluated studies for eligibility, extracted data, and assessed the included studies for risk of bias. Five of the 13 included studies, whose population made up 70% of the total sample population, had low risk of bias. The treatment groups in the individual studies received different steroid preparations, routes of administration, dosages, and duration of treatment. All groups otherwise received antibiotics and usual care for CAP. High-quality evidence showed that the use of steroids decreased hospital length of stay by one day and decreased time to clinical stability by 1. 22 days.

Finally, data from the 12 trials that assessed all-cause mortality revealed a trend toward decreased risk of death in the steroid group. The difference between the two groups for this end point became statistically significant when only the trials that met the criteria for severe pneumonia were included. Although steroid use, not surprisingly, increased the risk of significant hyperglycemia, there were no differences detected in the rates of gastrointestinal bleeds, severe neuropsychiatric complications, or rehospitalizations.

### The risk of corticosteroids in community-acquired… [^114jyeX6]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

To the Editor: A 71-year-old man with diabetes mellitus and osteoarthritis of the knee presented with a five-day history of epigastric pain and melena. Two weeks before his presentation, he completed a seven-day course of levofloxacin and prednisone for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia. The use of corticosteroids in clinical trials of CAP as adjunct to antibiotics dates back 60 years. It was hypothesized that corticosteroids could dampen the bacterial endotoxin-mediated cytokine storm, prevent progression to septic shock, and treat critical illness-related corticosteroid insufficiency. 1 Today, there is significant variability in the use of corticosteroids for the treatment of CAP in clinical practice. Our case illustrates an adverse patient event caused by inappropriate use. It is essential to distinguish the management of severe CAP from nonsevere CAP.

The Infectious Diseases Society of America/American Thoracic Society 2019 guidelines define severe CAP as requiring support in a critical care environment. 2 The previous IDSA/ATS 2007 guidelines did not comment on the routine use of corticosteroids for severe CAP, but the guidelines were updated in 2019 to advocate for use only in patients with septic shock refractory to vasopressors and fluid resuscitation.
3. Nonsevere CAP occurs in patients treated in the outpatient or general inpatient setting. The 2007 and 2019 IDSA/ATS guidelines recommend against the routine use of corticosteroids in nonsevere CAP. Previous studies have not demonstrated a mortality benefit and showed increased rates of hyperglycemia. 4 Furthermore, the harms associated with corticosteroid use are likely underreported.

Studies evaluating the safety of corticosteroids often exclude patients at the highest risk of complications, such as those with a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, neuropsychiatric conditions, immunocompromised state, and concurrent use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Hyperglycemia, fluid retention, hypertension, delirium, psychosis, insomnia, osteonecrosis, and gastrointestinal bleeding may consequently be underestimated. The potential harmful adverse effects of corticosteroids for nonsevere CAP outweigh the potential benefits. Our case illustrates the importance of avoiding the use of corticosteroids for the treatment of CAP.

### Topical steroid-antibiotic combinations… [^114icNWG]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Whether antibiotics should be combined with topical steroids in the treatment of chronic dermatoses is a question that is extraordinarily difficult to answer. The alternative proposed in this study is appraisal of efficacy in experimental human infection with Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans. With a broad spectrum steroid-antibiotic combination containing triamcinolone acetonide, neomycin gramicidin, and nystatin, it was possible to show that omission of any one component decreased the effectiveness of the mixture. The steroid by itself suppressed the experimental lesion without influencing the multiplication of the pathogen. Marples RR, Rebora A, Kligman AM.

### Oral steroids not helpful for acute lower respiratory tract infection… [^111KRLmG]. AAFP (2018). Low credibility.

Clinical Question Are steroids useful in the treatment of acute lower respiratory tract infection in adults without asthma. Bottom Line This study found no clinically significant benefit of steroids for the treatment of acute LRTI in adults without asthma, including those presenting with wheezing or shortness of breath. Synopsis Because symptoms of acute LRTI can mimic exacerbated asthma, steroids are commonly prescribed with or without antibiotics. These investigators enrolled adults, 18 years or older, presenting with an acute cough as the main symptom and at least one other lower respiratory tract symptom. Exclusion criteria included evidence of chronic pulmonary disease, having received any asthma medication in the previous five years, or requiring same-day hospitalization or urgent antibiotic treatment.

Patients randomly received 40 mg of prednisolone daily for five days or matched placebo. Those patients also receiving a nonurgent antibiotic prescription were asked to delay filling the prescription for at least 48 hours. Patients assessed outcomes using symptom diaries and remained masked to their treatment group assignment. Symptoms were measured daily, including twice-daily peak expiratory flow, for 28 days or until symptom resolution. Complete follow-up occurred for 94% of patients at 28 days. Using intention-treat analysis, no clinically significant group differences occurred in the median duration of cough or severity of symptoms, symptom duration, antibiotic use, peak flow, or patient satisfaction. There were also no significant subgroup effect differences.
