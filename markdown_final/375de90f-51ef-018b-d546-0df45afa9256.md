## Question

Patient falls on right side. What type of xray should be ordered

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what type of X-ray should be ordered after a patient falls on the right side. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the mechanism and likely injury patterns from a right-sided fall. Then, I should verify the initial imaging modality and views for suspected hip fracture. Next, I will consider the "rule of twos" for extremity injuries and when to image joints above and below. After that, I need to check what to do if radiographs are negative but suspicion remains high. Finally, I should review special scenarios like chest or head trauma and synthesize a concise, prioritized recommendation with safety checks and documentation needs.

> Let me first confirm the mechanism and injury patterns. A fall on the right side commonly produces injuries to the right hip, proximal femur, pelvis, right ribs, and right upper extremity, particularly the wrist, clavicle, and proximal humerus, with older adults at higher risk of fragility fractures and occult injuries that may be missed on plain films [^155acf67] [^d6fbe9ef].

> I will now examine the highest-yield initial study. For suspected hip fracture, the ACR Appropriateness Criteria recommend obtaining hip and pelvis radiographs as first-line imaging in acute pain after a fall or minor trauma, typically an AP view of the pelvis and AP and lateral views of the involved hip, because this combination detects most displaced fractures and guides next steps [^a3521f77] [^5b66a50b].

> Wait, let me verify the "rule of twos" for extremity injuries. In hemodynamically stable patients without immediate operative needs, obtain two orthogonal views (AP and lateral) of the injured bone and image the joints above and below the injury to identify associated fractures or dislocations; this applies to wrist, proximal humerus, ankle, and other long bones, and helps avoid missing concomitant injuries like a distal radius fracture with an elbow injury or a Maisonneuve pattern with a proximal fibula fracture [^7468c696] [^7f69c9df].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about negative films. Plain radiography can miss a meaningful fraction of fractures in older adults after low-energy falls, especially in the pelvic ring, ribs, and thoracolumbar spine, with sensitivity estimates often below 60% and negative predictive values that do not reliably exclude injury; therefore, if clinical suspicion persists, advanced imaging is warranted [^d4031f3d] [^bd895fb3].

> I should confirm the escalation pathway. If radiographs are negative but pain remains significant, inability to bear weight persists, or deformity is present, MRI is preferred for suspected occult hip fracture because it is more sensitive and specific than CT for marrow and cortical disruption; CT is an acceptable alternative when MRI is unavailable or contraindicated, and point-of-care ultrasound can occasionally suggest cortical disruption when radiographs are equivocal, prompting cross-sectional imaging [^62e4e925] [^1046cace] [^5bd4f74b].

> Let me consider chest trauma. If there is right-sided chest pain, tenderness, or respiratory symptoms, obtain a chest radiograph as initial imaging for suspected rib fracture; CT is reserved for high suspicion of occult injury, pathologic fractures, or when surgical planning is needed, and routine repeat chest radiographs are not necessary if the initial study is normal and the patient remains stable [^281b807b] [^654a3818] [^e7845f1a].

> But wait, what if there is head trauma or neurologic symptoms. In children under 2 years or in patients with concerning features, maintain a low threshold for head imaging; skull radiographs may be acceptable in select pediatric scenarios, but CT is the modality of choice when significant injury is suspected, balancing radiation and diagnostic yield with clinical judgment and observation when appropriate [^01ab4271].

> I need to ensure safety and documentation. Always confirm patient identity, the correct side, and the clinical question before imaging; document the mechanism, exam findings, and rationale for imaging choices, and communicate results promptly to guide disposition and follow-up, especially in older adults where missed fractures carry substantial morbidity [^ecdd5601] [^48259548].

> Let me synthesize a practical, prioritized approach. First, obtain a right hip and pelvis X-ray series (AP pelvis, AP and lateral right hip) for any right-sided fall with hip pain or inability to bear weight. Second, apply the rule of twos to any other symptomatic right-sided extremity, imaging the joint above and below when indicated. Third, if radiographs are negative but suspicion remains high, escalate to MRI of the hip for occult fracture or CT if MRI is unavailable. Fourth, add a chest radiograph if there are chest symptoms or exam findings suggesting rib injury. Fifth, tailor additional imaging to the specific clinical scenario, including wrist films for distal radius injury or shoulder films for proximal humerus pain, and consider head imaging if neurologic red flags are present [^a3521f77] [^7468c696] [^62e4e925] [^281b807b] [^de589123] [^57ffa8ac].

---

For a patient who fell on the right side, order **plain radiographs** of the right hip and pelvis (AP pelvis and cross-table lateral hip) [^a3521f77] as first-line imaging to assess for fracture or dislocation [^155acf67]. If radiographs are normal but clinical suspicion remains high, obtain an **MRI** [^62e4e925] to detect occult fractures or soft-tissue injuries [^1046cace]. Add a **chest X-ray** if there is chest pain or suspected rib injury [^281b807b], and use the Ottawa Ankle/Foot rules to decide on foot/ankle films if indicated [^e484640e] [^dd0acb1e]. This approach balances sensitivity, radiation, and cost while aligning with ACR guidelines [^a3521f77].

---

## Initial imaging: plain radiographs

Plain radiographs are the **first-line imaging** for suspected fractures after a fall [^155acf67] because they are fast, widely available, and expose patients to minimal radiation [^f4b6287d]. For a right-sided fall, obtain the following:

- **AP pelvis**: visualizes the pelvic ring, acetabulum, and proximal femur [^a3521f77].
- **Cross-table lateral hip**: evaluates the femoral head, neck, and trochanteric region for fractures or dislocation [^5b66a50b].

These views detect most hip and pelvic fractures; however, **occult fractures can be missed**, especially in osteoporotic patients [^d4031f3d].

---

## Indications for additional imaging

If radiographs are normal but clinical suspicion remains high (e.g. persistent pain, inability to bear weight, or deformity), **further imaging is indicated**:

- **MRI**: highly sensitive for occult hip fractures, marrow edema, and soft-tissue injuries; preferred when radiographs are inconclusive but suspicion remains high [^62e4e925] [^1046cace].
- **CT**: useful for complex fractures, surgical planning, or when MRI is contraindicated [^notfound].
- **Ultrasound**: emerging adjunct for detecting cortical disruption in occult hip fractures, though not yet standard of care [^5bd4f74b].

---

## Additional imaging based on clinical findings

Depending on clinical presentation, **additional radiographs** may be warranted:

| **Clinical finding** | **Recommended imaging** |
|-|-|
| Chest pain, dyspnea, or suspected rib fracture | Chest X-ray (CXR) [^281b807b] [^654a3818] |
| Ankle or foot pain, swelling, or deformity | Ankle/foot X-rays based on Ottawa Ankle/Foot rules [^e484640e] [^dd0acb1e] |
| Shoulder pain or deformity | Shoulder X-ray (AP, lateral, axillary views) [^251ea849] |
| Wrist pain or deformity | Wrist X-ray (AP, lateral, oblique views) [^de589123] |

---

## Special considerations

- **Elderly patients**: higher risk of occult fractures; maintain a low threshold for MRI when radiographs are normal but suspicion remains high [^d6fbe9ef].
- **Pediatric patients**: growth plate injuries are common; consider additional views or MRI if clinical suspicion persists [^notfound].
- **Osteoporosis**: fragility fractures may be subtle; MRI or DXA may be indicated for comprehensive assessment [^5e487f48].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Initial imaging**: AP pelvis and cross-table lateral hip radiographs [^a3521f77].
- **Secondary imaging**: MRI if radiographs are normal but suspicion remains high [^62e4e925].
- **Additional imaging**: chest X-ray for suspected rib injury; ankle/foot X-rays based on Ottawa rules; shoulder or wrist X-rays for localized symptoms [^281b807b] [^e484640e] [^57ffa8ac] [^de589123].

---

Plain radiographs are the **first-line imaging** for a patient who fell on the right side, with MRI reserved for occult injuries when radiographs are inconclusive [^a3521f77] [^62e4e925]. This approach ensures accurate diagnosis while minimizing radiation exposure and cost.

### Patient perspectives on radiation dose [^a80c23e3]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2014). Low credibility.

People with genetic cancer syndromes have a special interest in imaging. They also have special risk factors with respect to radiation. They need to utilize the potential of imaging while keeping in mind concerns about cumulative radiation exposure. Before imaging, early detection of problems was limited. With imaging, issues can be identified when they are small and a good plan of action can be developed early. Operations can be planned and metastatic cancer avoided. The positive contribution of imaging to the care of these patients can be profound. However, this additional surveillance is not without cost. An average patient with 1 of these syndromes will undergo 100 or more scans in their lifetime. Imaging professionals should be able to describe the risks and benefits of each scan in terms that the patient and the ordering physician can understand to make smart decisions about the ordering of scans. Why CT versus MRI? When are x-ray or ultrasound appropriate, and when are they not? What are the costs and the medical risks for the patient? What value does this picture add for the physician? Is there a way to answer the medical question with a test other than a scan? Medicine is a team sport, and the patient is an integral member of the team.

It is important to make sure that the correct patient is about to undergo a given radiologic procedure or examination. Examining the wrong patient could lead to unnecessary exposure to ionising radiation, to misdiagnosis of a severe pathology, or even to an unnecessary intervention.

In order to avoid this, the following should be done:
ASK the patient to state (and where possible/practical spell) their full name and date of birth;
ALWAYS check this against the patient identification band, which must say exactly the same;
NEVER ask the patient " are you Mr Jones ?"; the patient may have misheard and mistakenly agree;
NEVER assume the patient is in the right bed or that the name tag above the bed is correct.

Again, whenever possible, after the patient enters the examination room, and immediately before any diagnostic or therapeutic action or procedure, with the patient present, verbally (and/or in the patient identification bracelet) confirm:
Correct patient is present;
Correct examination is about to be performed;
Clinical history corresponds to the requested examination;
Correct side or site is being examined;
Right or left side markers, acquisition of the topogram, the ultrasound transducer, etc. are being used correctly and according to the side/extremity.

Communication among professionals (radiographers, radiologists, referrers/including handover)

Critical information must be accurately communicated between radiology department staff and staff from other departments or, within the radiology department, between professionals. For example, proper identification of those patients that need extra precautions (protective or contact isolation), are at a higher risk, or cannot wait for their turn in the waiting room depends on these communications channels. In a hospital, patients often move between areas of diagnosis, treatment, and care on a constant basis and may even come across several shifts of staff each day, which introduces an additional safety risk to the patient each time change happens. In all instances, the information communicated about a patient and the handover of a patient or a shift must achieve a balance between comprehensiveness and efficiency.

### Accuracy of plain radiography in detecting fractures in older individuals after low-energy falls: current evidence [^1876d205]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2020). Medium credibility.

This systematic review has some strengths and limitations. Strengths of our study were a well-defined search protocol and comprehensive search strategy across multiple databases and strict adherence to the PRISMA guidelines. Furthermore, we focused only on studies that evaluated CT imaging as the gold standard for fracture diagnosis in the ED setting or within a short-term period after the initial fall incident. The major limitation of our study is the lack of available high-quality evidence on this subject. Our systematic database search did not retrieve randomized controlled trials or high-quality non-randomized trials, therefore, the evidence generated is considered weak, at best. By expanding the inclusion criterion 'Population' we were able to include studies with patients aged ≥ 55 years or all-comer populations with a majority (≥ 50%) of patients aged ≥ 65 years or all-trauma populations with a majority (≥ 50%) of patients who sustained an LEF. This strategy retrieved nine additional studies for review. Second, there was a significant heterogeneity between the studies, due to variations in study quality, end points and outcomes as well as different inclusion criteria and patient selection. Therefore, we deemed a meta-analysis to be not feasible. Third, applying QUADAS criteria for quality assessment, this revealed an overall high risk of bias of the studies and across the studies, mainly concerning patients' spectrum, test execution, and diagnostic review performance. Finally, the reviewers who assessed study quality and risk of bias were not blinded to the authors' names nor the institution in which the study was conducted nor to the journal in which the study was published. This approach could potentially lead to bias in scoring the methodological quality of the studies. Therefore, the results of this study should be interpreted with these shortcomings in mind.

### Hip fracture: diagnosis, treatment, and secondary prevention [^5b66a50b]. American Family Physician (2014). Low credibility.

Hip fractures cause significant morbidity and are associated with increased mortality. Women experience 80% of hip fractures, and the average age of persons who have a hip fracture is 80 years. Most hip fractures are associated with a fall, although other risk factors include decreased bone mineral density, reduced level of activity, and chronic medication use. Patients with hip fractures have pain in the groin and are unable to bear weight on the affected extremity. During the physical examination, displaced fractures present with external rotation and abduction, and the leg will appear shortened. Plain radiography with cross-table lateral view of the hip and anteroposterior view of the pelvis usually confirms the diagnosis. If an occult hip fracture is suspected and plain radiography is normal, magnetic resonance imaging should be ordered. Most fractures are treated surgically unless the patient has significant comorbidities or reduced life expectancy. The consulting orthopedic surgeon will choose the surgical procedure. Patients should receive prophylactic antibiotics, particularly against Staphylococcus aureus, before surgery. In addition, patients should receive thromboembolic prophylaxis, preferably with low-molecular-weight heparin. Rehabilitation is critical to long-term recovery. Unless contraindicated, bisphosphonate therapy should be used to reduce the risk of another hip fracture. Some patients may benefit from a fall-prevention assessment.

### Governmental regulations and radiation exposure [^dba5549e]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Background

The use of radiation for medical purposes falls under the purview of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and individual states. Enhanced regulations are in place to promote the right exam for the right reason at the right time for every patient exposed to medical x-rays.

Methods

The February 2010 FDA initiative to reduce unnecessary radiation exposure from fluoroscopy, CT, and nuclear medicine studies is reviewed along with regulations currently in place.

Results

Facilities granting privileges to physicians performing fluoroscopic procedures need to ensure appropriate education so they can assess individual patient risk and benefit on a case-by-case basis. These are guidelines with individual states controlling requirements.

Conclusion

Regulation of education, training, and credentialing for physician operators of fluoroscopic equipment is currently controlled by individual states and is not uniform. There are strong indications that the FDA and or the Joint Commission will become increasingly involved to increase documentation of patient exposure and safety.

For each patient it is essential to ensure the following:
The patient has the right information to make a decision;
The information has been presented in a way that the patient can understand;
The patient has shared in the process of decision making and agrees with the outcome.

There are a number of considerations to take account of when obtaining consent as highlighted in Fig. 1.

Fig. 1
Considerations to take account of when obtaining consent (reproduced from the Society and College of Radiographers, with their permission)

Legal Issues The patient must be in possession of all the information to make the decision and to be able to do this voluntarily without pressure from external sources.
Advocacy It is important that patients have access to the right support to enable them to make their decision. A HCP has the responsibility to identify when a patient may require support and for someone to 'speak on their behalf'.
Shared decision-making The process of consent should be flexible to suit the patient's needs; it is not a rigid process and time must be allowed for patients to assimilate information prior to being asked to make a decision. The process must be personalised to meet the individual's needs.
Capacity Every person has the right to make a decision and it must be assumed that they have the capacity to do so. Where decisions need to be taken on behalf of an individual this must be done with the interests of the individual being at the centre. It is essential that each professional undertaking the process of obtaining consent is up to date with the national laws in their country and hospital processes with regard to this.
Communication of risk and benefit The involved healthcare professionals must inform the individual (or, where appropriate, their carer) of the risks and benefits of the examination and in doing so explain the risks of not having the imaging examination, in a form understandable to the patient. Where possible, patients should be given sufficient time to consider this information fully, before proceeding. Practitioners must respect the patient's wishes. Many radiological examinations carry a risk. The risks related to radiation exposure and other risks depending upon the examination, for example invasive techniques, should be explained in an understandable form for the patient (e.g. comparative information about the proposed investigation radiation dose in relation to background radiation compared to when flying in an aeroplane). Written information is valuable and can be used by the patient in discussion with their families and carers prior to consenting to the process.
Practicalities of the consent process Professionals must follow their hospital and national laws in relation to the practicalities of the consent process. Consent can take verbal and written forms and must take account of paperless systems. Details of the consent process must be fully recorded. Obtaining consent for procedures is a shared responsibility, involving the referring clinician and radiology department personnel; the balance of responsibilities will depend on specific circumstances and working arrangements.

### Spontaneous resolution of a large traumatic pneumothorax [^59c762d4]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to describe a case of a large traumatic pneumothorax (> 55%) that resolved completely without intervention. A pneumothorax is the accumulation of air between the visceral and parietal pleura. It can occur spontaneously or be traumatic. Spontaneous pneumothoraces can occur with no underlying lung disease or secondary in nature. The emergency department (ED) treatment of pneumothoraces depends on their size, their etiology, and clinical stability of the patient. The current recommendation is observation in stable patients with < 15% pneumothorax and tube thoracostomy in patients with > 15% pneumothorax. A 33-year-old woman presented to our ED complaining of right knee and right lateral chest wall pain after falling. Her breath sounds were reported as normal. A chest radiograph was ordered, which showed a large right-sided pneumothorax with tracheal deviation suggestive of a tension pneumothorax. The provider did not appreciate the pneumothorax at the time, and she was subsequently discharged home. The radiograph was over-read in the morning, and several attempts were made to recall the patient but were unsuccessful. Fortunately, the patient returned to the ED for an unrelated complaint approximately 1 month later, and the radiograph was repeated, confirming full resolution of the pneumothorax. She was not treated at another facility during that time. This is a typical manifestation of a traumatic pneumothorax but with an atypical course and outcome. It raises the question of whether, even in the case of traumatic pneumothorax, the threshold for placement of chest tubes could be reconsidered in stable patients.

### The problem with how we view medical (and diagnostic) error in emergency medicine [^39856ead]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Despite countless hours and attempts to improve safety in health care, we recognize a frustrating lack of progress to actualize a safer health care system. Nurses, doctors, pharmacists, and others often dedicate their time and effort outside of their clinical appointments to improve both patient care and the system within which they work. When asking any health care worker "do you care about safety?" they may say "Of course! It is my highest priority". However, despite best intentions and significant efforts, there exists a lack of objective improvement. Why have efforts to date been insufficient to improve safety in health care? We theorize that the answer is multifactorial and encompasses two primary etiologies: (1) a lack of application of a human‐centered sociotechnical system (STS) lens and (2) chasing errors instead of focusing on hazards. Let us demonstrate this by exploring key concepts and approaches to medical and diagnostic error within the context of the following case:

Presentation: A 26‐year‐old male with no significant medical history presented with chest pain and shortness of breath to the emergency department (ED). The triage nurse noted his lung sounds were significantly diminished on the left side and was suspicious for a pneumothorax. He was roomed promptly with orders for an electrocardiogram (ECG) and chest x‐ray.

Diagnosis: The ECG demonstrated normal sinus rhythm, without arrhythmia, ischemia, or heart strain. The x‐ray was viewed by the ED physician and was consistent with a right‐sided pneumothorax.

Transition of care: A new ED physician arrived at shift change and offered to help due to an influx of new and unstable patients to the ED. The first physician asked their colleague to place a right‐sided chest tube for a patient with a diagnosed right‐sided pneumothorax (Figure 1). The oncoming physician called radiology for confirmation of findings due to transition of care. The radiologist who answered the phone switched tasks to look at the x‐ray in question and confirmed the diagnosis of right‐sided pneumothorax.

Results

Study selection and study characteristics

A total of 8944 records were identified by the systematic database search. After adjusting for duplicates, 6250 records were excluded by screening of titles and abstracts, independently reviewed by two reviewers (VP and AL). Forty-one studies were eligible for full-text review (figure 1). Thirty-nine studies were excluded when applying the PICO inclusion criteria. Formally, only two studiesmet all PICO criteria. Therefore, we decided to secondarily include all studies meeting the criteria of Intervention, Comparison and Outcome but with an adapted criteria for Population. Thus, nine more studies with selected cohorts including patients < 65 years of age (but with mean/median age ≥ 65 years or ≥ 50% of included patients ≥ 65 years of age) or including other mechanisms of injury than LEF (but LEF in ≥ 50% of patients) were considered for extraction. An overview of study characteristics and extracted data is provided in online supplemental table 2.

### Management of postmenopausal osteoporosis: ACOG clinical practice guideline no. 2 [^5e487f48]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2022). High credibility.

Postmenopausal osteoporosis — diagnosis: Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), which measures bone mineral density (BMD), is the preferred test for identifying bone loss and assessing risk of fracture, and hip and lumbar spine measurements by DXA provide the most accurate and precise measurements of BMD; results are reported as a T-score, and the World Health Organization defines osteoporosis as a BMD T-score of less than or equal to −2.5 standard deviations; osteoporosis also can be diagnosed clinically if an individual develops a fragility fracture, defined as a fracture that occurs from a fall at less than standing height, most commonly of the spine, hip, wrist, humerus, rib, or pelvis.

### Proximal humerus fractures: evaluation and management in the elderly patient [^251ea849]. Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation (2018). Low credibility.

Evaluation and General Considerations

The typical presentation of a proximal humerus fracture is an elderly female who falls and sustains a minimally displaced or 2-part fracture (Figure 3). Around 1 in 10 will present with an additional fracture. Important historical elements include the patient's level of independence, functional demands, and any preexisting rotator cuff conditions. Evaluation should begin with inspection of the soft tissues and skin, as elderly patients are susceptible to poor wound healing. A full neurologic examination can be difficult following trauma, but function of the fingers, wrist, and elbow can often be evaluated. Axillary nerve innervation of the deltoid needs to be tested as reverse shoulder arthroplasty (RTSA) is a viable treatment option that requires an intact and innervated deltoid.

Figure 3.
Anteroposterior views of 3 shoulders demonstrating the most commonly encountered fracture patterns: minimally displaced (left) and surgical neck fractures (middle, right) with variable impaction and comminution.

True anteroposterior (AP), lateral, and axillary X-rays of the glenohumeral joint should be ordered. Computed tomography is recommended for complex fracture patterns or when fracture lines cannot be clearly visualized. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be useful for assessing rotator cuff integrity when considering nonoperative treatment. In a prospective study of 30 patients, nearly 40% of proximal humerus fractures were associated with rotator cuff tears. In another MRI cohort study of 76 patients with proximal humerus fractures, 22 had cuff tears at the time of injury, and 10 developed tears at 1 year. Functional loss correlated with tears at the time of injury.

Bone density is a predictor of surgical reduction quality and screw cutout. Density can be assessed with cortical bone thickness measurements on AP views of the shoulder. Two techniques are detailed in Figure 4: the Tingart measurementand the deltoid tuberosity index. Bone quality and social independence can serve as indicators of physiologic age, which is more important than chronologic age when weighing treatment options. Several studies have shown no difference in outcomes between elderly patients and younger patients following surgical fixation of proximal humerus fractures. - Further, a 1-year outcome study of 637 proximal humerus fractures showed that social independence, not age, was a predictor of outcome.

### Best practices guidelines in imaging [^62a60cb9]. ACS (2018). Medium credibility.

Imaging in geriatric patients with low-energy mechanism injuries — elderly persons aged 65 and older face rising trauma burden, with the geriatric population projected to double in size, from 46 million in 2016 to more than 98 million by 2060 and the share of the population expected to grow from 15 percent to nearly 24 percent. The most common injury mechanism is a ground-level fall, accounting for 75 percent of trauma events, and 90 percent of those falls are from the standing position. Injuries are often underestimated and this population is highly susceptible to trauma recidivism due to physiologic and psychosocial vulnerability, while changes in physiology, especially age-related balance and flexibility deficits, are responsible for a higher risk of injury following a low-impact mechanism.

### Accuracy of plain radiography in detecting fractures in older individuals after low-energy falls: current evidence [^d4031f3d]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Older individuals sustaining low-energy falls (LEF) and presenting to the emergency department (ED) demand straightforward diagnostic measures for injury detection. Plain radiography (XR) series for diagnosis of fall-related injuries are standard of care, but frequently subsequent CT examination is required for diagnostic assurance. A systematic database search of diagnostic accuracy of XR for detection of fractures in older LEF patients was performed.

Methods

We searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, WHO International Clinical Trial Platform, and Clinical trials.gov databases from inception to January 2020 for studies including older patients (≥ 65 years) with LEF and obtaining CT examination and XR of the skeleton in an ED setting.

Results

From 8944 references screened, 11 studies met the criteria for inclusion. Performance of XR for detection of fractures of the pelvic ring and hip was analyzed in nine studies, two studies investigated XR performance to detect rib fractures, and two studies compared diagnostic accuracy of thoracolumbar spine XR. Sensitivity estimates ranged from 10% to 58% and specificity estimates from 55% to 100%. Clinical and statistical heterogeneity was significant among included studies, with an overall considerable risk of bias.

Discussion

High-quality evidence on accurate imaging strategies in older patients with LEF is lacking to date. XR is missing a reasonable amount of fractures of the pelvic ring, rib cage, and thoracic and lumbar spine. However, the utility of first-line CT imaging and the benefit of diagnosing every fracture is unknown, demanding high-quality prospective trials considering patient-oriented outcome as well.

### Are routine repeat chest X-rays before leaving the trauma room useful? [^e7845f1a]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Several guidelines advocate multiple chest x-rays during primary resuscitation of trauma patients. Some local hospital protocols include a repeat x-ray before leaving the trauma resuscitation room (TR). The purpose of this study was to determine the value of routine repeat x-rays.

Methods

One-year data of all radiological imaging in the TR were prospectively collected for all patients presenting to the TR of the hospital. The x-rays were counted and assessed and the findings were classified as either 'new injury detected', 'presence of intervention devices' or 'deterioration of previously detected injury'.

Results

A total of 674 patients were included. More than 75% had two x-rays. Eight (2.1%) new injuries without clinical relevance were found on the repeat x-ray after an initial normal x-ray. 61 patients (9%) had a repeat x-ray to verify the effect of an intervention or position of devices. In 28 patients (22%) with two abnormal x-rays, newly diagnosed injuries (n = 9) or deterioration of known injuries (n = 19) were found. In 411 patients (81%) the results of the repeat x-ray had no clinical consequences.

Conclusion

This study indicates that routine repeat chest x-rays can be omitted in trauma patients whose initial chest x-ray is normal.

### Pelvic radiography in ATLS algorithms: a diminishing role? [^a5578fe6]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Pelvic x-ray is a routine part of the primary survey of polytraumatized patients according to Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) guidelines. However, pelvic CT is the gold standard imaging technique in the diagnosis of pelvic fractures. This study was conducted to confirm the safety of a modified ATLS algorithm omitting pelvic x-ray in hemodynamically stable polytraumatized patients with clinically stable pelvis in favour of later pelvic examination by CT scan.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective analysis of all polytraumatized patients in our emergency room between 01.07.2004 and 31.01.2006. Inclusion criteria were blunt abdominal trauma, initial hemodynamic stability and a stable pelvis on clinical examination. We excluded patients requiring immediate intervention because of hemodynamic instability.

Results

We reviewed the records of n = 452 polytraumatized patients, of which n = 91 fulfilled inclusion criteria (56% male, mean age = 45 years). The mechanism of trauma included 43% road traffic accidents, 47% falls. In 68/91 (75%) patients, both a pelvic x-ray and a CT examination were performed; the remainder had only pelvic CT. In 6/68 (9%) patients, pelvic fracture was diagnosed by pelvic x-ray. None of these 6 patients was found having a false positive pelvic x-ray, i.e. there was no fracture on pelvic CT scan. In 3/68 (4%) cases a fracture was missed in the pelvic x-ray, but confirmed on CT (false negative on x-ray). None of the diagnosed fractures needed an immediate therapeutic intervention. 5 (56%) were classified type A fractures, and another 4 (44%) B 2.1 in computed tomography (AO classification). One A 2.1 fracture was found in a clinically stable patient who only received CT scan (1/23).

Conclusion

While pelvic x-ray is an integral part of ATLS assessment, this retrospective study suggests that in hemodynamically stable patients with clinically stable pevis, its sensitivity is only 67% and it may safely be omitted in favor of a pelvic CT examination if such is planned in adjunct assessment and available. The results support the safety and utility of our modified ATLS algorithm. A randomized controlled trial using the algorithm can safely be conducted to confirm the results.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® acute trauma to the knee [^0940358b]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2012). Low credibility.

There are more than 1 million visits to the ER annually in the United States for acute knee trauma. Many of these are twisting injuries in young patients who can walk and bear weight, and emergent radiography is not required. Several clinical decision rules have been devised that can considerably reduce the number of radiographic studies ordered without missing a clinically significant fracture. Although fractures are seen on only 5% of emergency department knee radiographs, 86% of knee fractures result from blunt trauma. In patients with falls or twisting injuries who have focal tenderness, effusion, or inability to bear weight, radiography should be the first imaging study performed. If radiography shows no fracture, MRI is best for evaluating for a suspected meniscal or ligament tear or patellar dislocation. Patients with knee dislocation should undergo radiography and MRI, as well as fluoroscopic angiography, CT angiography, or MR angiography. The ACR Appropriateness Criteria(®) are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed every 2 years by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and review include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer-reviewed journals and the application of a well-established consensus methodology (modified Delphi) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures by the panel. In those instances in which evidence is lacking or not definitive, expert opinion may be used to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Diagnosis of an occult hip fracture by point-of-care ultrasound [^5bd4f74b]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Hip fractures are common injuries, particularly among elderly patients. Although plain radiographs are the initial imaging modality of choice, approximately 10% of hip fractures are not radiographically evident. Failure to diagnose a hip fracture in the emergency department may result in delayed diagnosis and potentially devastating consequences.

Case Report

We report the case of an 81-year-old woman with right hip pain after a fall. Although plain radiographs of the right hip and femur were negative for fracture, point-of-care ultrasound of the right hip demonstrated a cortical disruption in the femur consistent with a fracture. Given the clinical and ultrasound findings, computed tomography of the bony pelvis and proximal femurs was performed, which confirmed an oblique complex fracture of the right femur through the greater and lesser trochanters. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Point-of-care ultrasound, in conjunction with clinical suspicion, may help identify patients who require more advanced imaging to identify occult hip fractures.

### Updated practice guideline for dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) [^d484e91d]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2025). Medium credibility.

Vertebral fracture assessment (VFA) (Fig. 5)

VFA utilises low radiation dose imaging of the lateral lumbar and thoracic spine that can be acquired at the time of BMD measurement on DXA. VFA is performed for the purpose of diagnosing vertebral fractures with the range of evaluable vertebral bodies from about T4 to L4. The scanning area should include the entire spine, starting from the S1 vertebral body upwards.

Fig. 5
Examples Hologic VFA DXA. Mild fracture at the vertebral level Th11, grade 1 (left side and mid (same subject but with 6-point markers). Right-sided fractures with moderate wedge at level Th7 and Th8, and a moderate crush fracture at level Th12

Occasionally, it is difficult to determine the S1 level. In general, most individuals have 5 lumbar vertebrae with the iliac crests at the level of the L4/L5 disk, although in some individuals, there may be either 4 or 6 lumbar-like vertebral bodies. The interpreter must be familiar with standard scanning procedures in order to judge if the image and resulting data are acceptable. Depending on the scanner capabilities, scans may be acquired either in a lateral decubitus position or supine with the tube/detector in a lateral position (C-arm style scanners). Difficulties in positioning may arise in patients with mobility challenges, kyphosis or scoliosis, and may require repositioning (e.g. reverse the side of the lateral position to straighten the curve) or if justified on clinical grounds a traditional lumbar and thoracic lateral radiograph.

### Blunt chest trauma in the elderly: an expert practice review [^c594d60b]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Trauma in the elderly (> 65 years) is an increasingly common presentation to the ED. A fall from standing height is the most common mechanism after which such patients present, and rib fracture is the most common non-spinal fracture. Thoracic injury in patients aged over 65 is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. There are currently no universally applied guidelines for assessment, investigation and management of such patients. In this expert practice review, we discuss the evidence base and options for clinical management in this vulnerable patient group.

### Best practices guidelines in imaging [^b9f9ffac]. ACS (2018). Medium credibility.

Blunt chest trauma — screening chest radiograph evaluation — should include identifying pneumothorax or hemothorax, noting pulmonary infiltrates suggesting contusions or aspiration, evaluating the diaphragms for direct injury or elevation due to abdominal pathology, identifying fractures of the ribs, clavicles, scapulae, and humeri, and checking alignment of the thoracic and upper lumbar vertebrae. Fractures on the initial screening chest radiograph provide important clues to energy transfer, with rib fractures providing clear evidence of thoracic and torso trauma, association of the number of fractures with morbidity and mortality, and the presence of any rib fracture increasing the likelihood of intraabdominal injuries.

### Accuracy of plain radiography in detecting fractures in older individuals after low-energy falls: current evidence [^bd895fb3]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

XR is currently the first-line diagnostic tool for detection of LEF-related injuries of the skeleton in older individuals presenting to the ED. XR findings are frequently equivocal, resulting in subsequent CT imaging for diagnostic assurance. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic literature review aimed at assessing the diagnostic performance of XR in detecting skeletal injuries after LEF. Our search yielded relatively few observational, predominantly retrospective, studies. The studies included in our systematic analysis demonstrated considerable clinical and statistical heterogeneity, whereby performance of a meta-analysis was not feasible. The assessment of test performance characteristics of the individual studies demonstrated that the diagnostic accuracy of XR was only moderate to poor, depending on the skeletal regions under investigation. Estimated sensitivities were 52% or less, NPV ranged from 14% to 81%, and LR − was 0.4, at best, indicating that a negative XR does not safely rule out fractures of the rib cage, thoracic or lumbar spine, and pelvic ring, with a currently unknown clinical relevance.

Four of the studies addressed this issue and reported about the clinical and surgical outcomes of the target population as secondary outcomes. An increased (more accurate) detection of posterior pelvic ring fractures led to an increase in surgical therapy, whereby, in these patients, early CT examination shortened the hospital LOS in patients treated surgically. However, when the treatment policy of pelvic ring fractures of an institution obviates surgical treatment, an increase in CT-detected posterior pelvic ring fractures did not influence the hospital admission rates and hospital LOS. Furthermore, an accurate diagnosis of rib fractures does not result in differences in hospital LOS, ICU admission rate or in-hospital mortality (7.3% without rib fractures vs. 10.3% with rib fractures), without adjustment for overall injury severity. The most comprehensive retrospective assessment of accurate fracture detection including the spine, rib cage, and pelvic ring demonstrated that the rate of surgical treatment and intervention was not different, if different imaging strategies (only XR, only CT, XR and CT) were compared. However, the retrospective design of all of these studies does not permit a conclusive determination of whether the accurate diagnosis of fractures significantly alters clinical or surgical outcomes. Current poor evidence demands future prospective randomized clinical trials, to assess whether a safe diagnosis of fractures in the older adults with LEF is beneficial for resource management (eg, ED LOS), clinical and surgical decision making, diagnostic and treatment costs, risk of radiation and, most importantly, patient-centered clinical outcomes.

### Recommendations for optimal care of the fragility fracture patient to reduce the risk of future fracture [^7999d445]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2004). Low credibility.

Fragility fractures resulting from low trauma events such as a fall from standing height affect up to one half of women and one third of men after age 50 years. These fractures are frequently associated with osteoporosis. History of a fragility fracture is among the strongest risk factors for future fracture. Therefore, optimal care of the patient with a fragility fracture includes not only treatment of the presenting fracture itself but also evaluation and treatment of the underlying cause or causes to prevent future fractures. However, despite the availability of therapeutic agents that reduce fracture risk among osteoporotic patients who have had a fracture, most patients with fragility fractures are not evaluated for osteoporosis or treated adequately to reduce the risk of future fracture. Orthopaedic surgeons are the first and often the only physicians seen by fracture patients. Thus, they have the unique opportunity to serve as primary advocates to ensure that appropriate action is taken to reduce the risk of future fracture.

Lateral hemithorax injuries — initial assessment and imaging: In unstable patients with absent breath sounds indicative of pneumothorax and/or hemothorax, place chest tubes on the affected side without waiting for confirmatory imaging; point-of-care chest ultrasonography (extended Focused Assessment with Sonography in Trauma [eFAST]) can be used to document pneumothorax/hemothorax when the provider has adequate training, and clinical examination can be incorrect in up to a third of cases. For hemodynamically stable patients, initially image with chest radiography, delineate wounds with radiopaque markers to approximate the injury trajectory, and if the initial chest radiograph is normal perform a follow up chest radiograph in 3–6 hours to rule out delayed pneumothorax; trauma centers with expertise in ultrasonography may choose to use this technique as a screening tool to detect pneumothorax and/or hemothorax. Before tube drainage, obtain a chest radiograph to evaluate for hemothorax or pneumothorax, perform a repeat chest radiograph after chest drainage to assess for retained hemothorax and/or pneumothorax, and consider using a contrast-enhanced MDCT scan (optimally at least a 64 slice) to evaluate for active chest wall hemorrhage, residual hemothorax and/or pneumothorax.

### The good rays: let them shine! [^b7d42a37]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2019). Medium credibility.

The current regulations have done well for many years, so why slacken them? The answer is simple. X-rays and radioactivity were discovered more than 120 years ago, and yet their potential in medical imaging has still not been fully exploited while the cost of healthcare is on a steep rise and more individualized diagnostics and therapy are called for. An example of this is PET imaging with 18 F-NaF to detect and grade early arterial wall microcalcification when it may still be amenable to therapy. NaF imaging is a methodology that may potentially lead to a breakthrough in the management of atherosclerosis, the world's number one killing disease, which may afflict us all if we grow old enough. However, to achieve this, longitudinal studies with NaF PET/CT, sometimes in combination with FDG PET/CT, are absolutely necessary. Nonetheless, to our knowledge, our Ethics Committee has not allowed the number of repeat examinations that are necessary to study disease progression in a prospective design. This is a serious obstacle to utilizing an important method without any risk from repetition, because the accumulated radiation dose amounts to only about 40 mSv distributed over several (5 or 6) years. Referring to current guidelines for the use of ionizing radiation in medical research, the Ethics Committee requires particularly strong arguments for the use of such doses in patients and finds them unacceptable in healthy control subjects. Therefore, one may ask who is favoured by the current tight radiation limits, when multiple observations confirm that annual radiation doses up to 100 mSv or more are completely harmless. According to a recent article by Siegel et al. in the Journal of Nuclear Medicine: "the 'prudence' of dose optimization… is responsible for misguided concerns promoting radiophobia, leading to actual risks far greater than the hypothetical carcinogenic risk purportedly avoided".

### Derivation of a decision instrument for selective chest radiography in blunt trauma [^fc746ecb]. The Journal of Trauma (2011). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "NEXUS criteria for chest X-ray in blunt chest trauma" for blunt cardiac injury, blunt chest trauma, traumatic thoracic aortic injury and clavicle fracture.

The NEXUS Chest Decision Instrument (NEXUS Chest X-ray) is a clinical calculator used in the evaluation of patients who have experienced blunt chest trauma. This scoring system is designed to identify patients who are at low risk of injury and therefore may not require imaging, specifically chest X-ray, thus reducing unnecessary radiation exposure and healthcare costs.

The NEXUS Chest X-ray is applicable to patients who have sustained blunt chest trauma, often due to incidents such as motor vehicle accidents, falls, or physical assaults.

The clinical utility of this calculator is to aid in the decision-making process of whether a chest X-ray is necessary, based on the presence or absence of certain criteria. These criteria include age over 60, rapid deceleration mechanism, chest pain, intoxication, altered mental status, distracting painful injury, and tenderness in the chest wall, sternum, thoracic spine, or scapula.

Patients who do not meet any of these criteria are considered at low risk for significant injury and may not require a chest X-ray. However, the decision to forego imaging should always be made in conjunction with clinical judgment.

The NEXUS Chest X-ray should not be used in patients with penetrating chest trauma, those with a known history of chest injury or

The NEXUS criteria for chest X-ray assessment in cases of blunt chest trauma is designed to evaluate the risk of significant intrathoracic injury by scoring specific risk factors. Each factor is assigned an equal weighting. The factors considered and their respective conditions are as follows:

- Age greater than 60 years
- Involvement in a rapid deceleration accident, such as falling more than 6 meters or being in a motor vehicle crash traveling faster than 64 km/hour
- Experiencing chest pain
- Presence of intoxication
- Altered mental status
- Presence of distracting painful injury
- Notable chest wall tenderness

These inputs are evaluated as true or false, resulting in a score of either 1 or 0 for each factor, respectively. The scores from all these factors are summed to yield a total score, which ranges from 0 to 7.

The interpretation of these scores is straightforward:

- If the total score is 0, the risk of significant intrathoracic injury is considered low, and thus, imaging is generally not required.
- Conversely, a score of 1 or higher signals a heightened risk of significant intrathoracic injury, warranting consideration of imaging to assess the injured area further.

### Accuracy of plain radiography in detecting fractures in older individuals after low-energy falls: current evidence [^d6fbe9ef]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Low-energy falls (LEF) are defined as a fall from standing height or less and include falls while transferring, sitting or from the bed. They are one of the most common reasons for emergency department (ED) presentation in older patients and visit rates are increasing.LEF are the leading mechanism of fatal and non-fatal injury in individuals aged 65 years or older in developed countriesand are associated with significant morbidity and mortality that appear to increase with age.

A recent comprehensive trauma registry data analysis emphasized that LEF is the predominant trauma mechanism in older individuals and leads to injuries as severe as those caused by high-energy mechanisms in younger patients.LEF is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, which appear to increase with age. These patients are jeopardized by underestimation of the trauma mechanism and by lack of early identification of potentially severe injuries during the course of clinical management.

Liberal use of pan-scan CT for injury detection in older trauma patients has been recommended, but there is still a paucity of evidence to support this. Evidence regarding imaging strategies in older patients with LEF is even scarcer. Reports of serious mismanagement such as delayed diagnosis of entire injury patterns, life-threatening hemorrhage from missed low-energy fractures of the pelvic ring, or predisposition to highly unstable spine injuries due to ankylosing spondylitis, further urge a critical appraisal.

In standard practice, advanced imaging studies such as CT are mainly conclusive in patients when plain radiography (XR) findings are equivocal or inconsistent with clinical suspicion. In general, the inclusion of imaging in the ED constitutes a major risk factor for prolonged ED length of stay (LOS) > 4 hours for older individuals, which is subsequently associated with an increased risk for hospital admission and 30-day-readmission, increased hospital LOS, and increased in-hospital mortality.

The objective of this systematic review was to provide a summary of the current evidence and an estimation of the accuracy of XR in fracture diagnosis in older LEF patients compared with CT examinations.

Communication guidance states, "Provide the radiologist with a detailed description of the clinical scenario when requesting an imaging study", because "An inadequate description of the mechanism of injury or simply stating "trauma, rule out injury", on the imaging requisition significantly limits the radiologist's ability to comment on a potential mismatch of the observed injury relative to the reported mechanism". Examples include "humeral or forearm diaphysis fractures with a reported history of fall", and that "A fall mechanism more commonly results in a metaphysis injury rather than a diaphysis fracture".

### Best practices guidelines in imaging [^e202db56]. ACS (2018). Medium credibility.

Chest imaging — key points in trauma care emphasize that the AP chest radiograph is the single most valuable diagnostic study in the management of chest trauma performed in the trauma receiving area. A chest CT is warranted in all adult patients with high-energy torso trauma, a positive chest radiograph, or positive findings on physical examination, and chest CT has low sensitivity for detection of blunt cardiac injury. In pediatrics, for the pediatric patient with minor abnormalities on chest radiograph, chest CT is reported to have no impact on subsequent management, whereas a chest CT is recommended for children with an abnormal contour of the mediastinum to an age-appropriate shaped chest.

### Best practices guidelines in imaging [^300e907c]. ACS (2018). Medium credibility.

Chest radiographs — trauma bay acquisition and interpretation state that for the management of chest trauma the AP chest radiograph is the single most valuable diagnostic study performed in the trauma receiving area, but because the chest radiograph is taken under adverse conditions in the trauma bay it has less sensitivity and specificity than the classic standing PA and lateral chest films taken in a dedicated radiology suite. Safety and workflow guidance includes that the over-reliance on a quick chest radiograph prior to needed interventions can be life-threatening to the patient, patients may arrive on backboards and it is preferable to remove all boards when patients are log-rolled, and in penetrating trauma without concern about spinal instability clinicians should consider if it is possible to have the patient sit up to improve the radiograph quality. Image handling notes state that unless gross pathology exists that mandates intervention, download the image to the trauma center's imaging system for higher resolution and post-processing manipulation rather than viewing the chest radiograph on the digital portable machine, after which the radiograph is then read in a consistent and systematic fashion by evaluating first for evidence of pulmonary and pleural pathology and by noting the position of all tubes and expansion of the lungs.

### Best practices guidelines in imaging [^4f4ddc4d]. ACS (2018). Medium credibility.

Radiographic imaging in trauma — conventional torso radiographic imaging is a primary adjunct to rapidly facilitate the diagnosis of immediate threats to life related to breathing and hemorrhage in the chest (chest radiograph) and/or extraperitoneal pelvis (pelvis radiograph). These radiographs allow the treating physician to expeditiously assess for, and immediately intervene in, life-threatening conditions such as cardiac tamponade, pneumothorax, or hemothorax. Perform a chest radiograph in all trauma patients with potential for thoracic injury and for evaluation of any tubes and lines placed during resuscitation. In the experienced provider's hands, FAST may have sensitivities higher than a conventional chest radiograph for pneumothorax and hemothorax. Extremity radiographs remain an important secondary adjunct for diagnosis of extremity orthopaedic injury, and a best practice is interpretation of all radiographs concurrent with the trauma evaluation to facilitate timely treatment interventions.

Other risk-assessment and imaging methods — T-score values obtained with ultrasound or quantitative computed tomography (CT) are not substitutes for dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) because they may overestimate or underestimate BMD and thus fracture risk, and for patients unable to have hip or spine DXA, assessing fracture risk with FRAX without BMD provides more useful information than BMD measured by alternate techniques. Biomechanical CT analyzes quantitative CT scans of the LS and hip with finite element analysis and predicts fracture risk, but its advantage over DXA is small; access is limited and its role in routine clinical practice has not been defined. Trabecular bone score analyzes heterogeneity on routine LS DXA images, correlates with trabecular microarchitecture, predicts fracture risk independently from bone density, has recently been incorporated into FRAX, and is most helpful in women whose fracture risk is near the treatment threshold. Assessing fall risk, emphasizing a recent fall, is important in older women, and the Stopping Elderly Accidents Deaths and Injury initiative provides an algorithm for fall-risk screening.

FIGURE 1
The patient chest x‐ray upon arrival, interpreted as a right‐sided pneumothorax.

The catch: During the consent process for the chest tube, the patient asked why the pain was on the left if the collapsed lung was on the right. At the same time, the physician received a call back from radiology stating that either the patient had situs inversus or this x‐ray was a mirror image due to the gastric bubble under the right diaphragm. The team decided to repeat the exam, x‐ray, and point‐of‐care ultrasound (POCUS). With this information, the patient was correctly diagnosed with a left‐sided pneumothorax. He was reconsented for the correct left‐sided procedure and a pigtail chest tube was placed.

What happened? Unbeknownst to the physician team, the patient had been uncomfortable laying supine or sitting upright for his portable x‐ray; therefore, the x‐ray was performed with the patient in a prone position. Moreover, while the left and right markers were utilized, the indicators were not readjusted with the patient in prone positioning and therefore incorrectly identified laterality on the image. The image was, in fact, a mirror image.

Diagnostic algorithm

The choice of a diagnostic procedure depends on the patient's condition and traumatic mechanism. In low-energy traumas (falls from heights of up to 3 m and traffic accidents at speeds of up to 50 km/h), the standard method includes X-ray and ultrasound examinations. The chest MDCT examination should be performed only in case of unclear findings or if more detailed assessment is needed. In patients with high-energy trauma (falls from heights above 3 m and traffic accidents at speeds exceeding 50 km/h) and unknown mechanism of trauma, the chest MDCT examination should be performed as a screening method. The examination is usually a part of the whole-body CT. In stable patients with no apparent need of emergency intervention, the MDCT examination can be performed directly after admission to a health-care facility and primary clinical examination. In the case of circulatory instability or if pharmacological circulatory support is needed, the chest X-ray in supine position is usually performed as well as ultrasound examination to exclude findings that require an immediate intervention. The MDCT examination should be performed only after these necessary procedures have been completed. In the event that MDCT is a part of the emergency department and the examination can be performed concurrently with resuscitation, this step can be skipped, and the MDCT can be used in this situation as the primary imaging method (Fig. 4). Routine use of MDCT in cases of high-energy trauma is associated with higher costs, radiation burden and numerous minor additional findings. Nevertheless, this procedure cannot be abandoned because there is a risk of omission of a clinically silent, curable life-threatening condition, such as aortic trauma.

Results

Over the evaluated period of 18 months our trauma team treated 452 polytraumatized patients with blunt abdominal trauma. 91 of them fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The mean patient age was 45 years, and 44% were women. The mechanism of trauma was road traffic accident in 47% and fall in 43%. Mean Injury Severity Score (ISS) was 23, with a range of 17 to 50. 78 patients (86%) initially had hemorrhagic shock class 0 or 1, 13 patients (14%) class 2. All responded rapidly to initial fluid resuscitation (2 L of warmed ringer's lactate).

68 (75%) of the 91 overall patients received both a pelvic x-ray and a CT examination (group I). In 6 patients (9%) of group I, a pelvic fracture was diagnosed through PXR; in all of those cases the finding was confirmed in the CT examination – no false positive PXR were observed. In 3 patients of group I (4%) a pelvic fracture was missed in the pelvic x-ray. Two of these patients with missed fractures were initially x-rayed and assessed in peripheral hospitals and transferred to our unit for CT examination. One fracture was classified A 2.1 (undisplaced fractures of ramus superior of os pubis); the second was a A 1.2 type (minimal displaced fracture of the iliac wing). Both were easily detected on retrospective evaluation by an experienced trauma surgeon. The third missed fracture was classified A 2.2 (unilateral minimal compression fracture of the massa lateralis of the sacrum) and could not be detected even on retrospective evaluation of pelvic x-ray. Overall in group I one A 1.2, three A 2.1, one A 2.2, and four B 2.1 were diagnosed by CT examination. Specificity of pelvic x-ray in relation to CT was found to be 100% and sensitivity 67% (see Table 1).

### Did I miss that: subtle and commonly missed findings on chest radiographs [^f4b6287d]. Current Problems in Diagnostic Radiology (2014). Low credibility.

This article reviews examples of easily missed, subtle, or ambiguous lesions on chest radiography. Anecdotally, reliance on cross-sectional imaging has diminished radiologists׳ comfort level with chest radiograph interpretation. However, plain film chest radiography remains a valuable tool in diagnostic imaging. It is noninvasive, inexpensive, easily obtained, and diagnostic for many common conditions with the benefit of a very low radiation dose. It is one of the most commonly ordered radiographic examinations; therefore, proficiency in chest radiograph interpretation remains an essential tool in our diagnostic armamentarium. Certain anatomical regions on chest radiographs are particularly prone to perceptual errors. These are often referred to as "blind spots" and have been emphasized as we demonstrate methods that can be applied to search patterns to improve detection of abnormalities.

Other imaging — children with suspected intentional injury: CT of the chest with intravenous (IV) contrast is recommended when clinical suspicion of intrathoracic vascular injury exists, whereas CT of the chest without contrast has higher sensitivity for rib fractures than radiograph but is considered an adjunctive exam and routine use is not recommended. Tc-99m whole-body bone scan is an adjunctive examination for the detection of fractures and has utility when clinical suspicion is high but the skeletal survey is negative or findings are equivocal or subtle; venipuncture is required for radiotracer injection and sedation is often required because image acquisition requires a stationary patient for a longer interval compared to other modalities. Ultrasound does not have a role in the imaging work-up of children with suspected intentional injury.

Imaging conditions for suspected spine trauma — American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria — use a decision algorithm in which the presence of any high‑risk factor ("Age ≥ 65 y", "Dangerous mechanism (A)", or "Upper extremity paresthesia") leads to "Imaging (D)". If no high‑risk factor is present, assess for "Any low-risk factor allowing range-of-motion assessment"; if none are present, proceed to "Imaging (D)". If low‑risk factors are present, test rotation; inability to rotate the neck "45° left and right" prompts "Imaging (D)", whereas ability supports "No imaging (D)". Dangerous mechanism (A) is defined as "Fall from ≥ 3 ft/5 stairs, axial load, MVC at ≥ 60 mph or rollover or ejection, motorized recreational vehicle accident, bicycle collision", while for simple rear‑end motor vehicle collision (B) it "excludes pushed into on-coming traffic, hit by bus or large truck, rollover, hit by high speed vehicle", and delayed onset neck pain (C) means "No immediate onset after trauma".

Discussion and Conclusion

This retrospective data suggests that pelvic x-ray can safely be avoided in hemodynamically stable patients with clinically stable pelvis. Firstly, patients who received both a pelvic x-ray and a CT scan and those who received a CT scan only, had identical outcome. Secondly, none of the patients who received a subsequent CT scan only, had any acute complications. One case with an A 2.1 pelvic fracture, which was clinically stable and not bleeding, was missed in the clinical examination during the primary survey and might have been detected earlier using conventional radiography after the primary survey.

Even though conventional pelvic x-ray in Emergency Departments was shown to have a specifity of 100% compared with CT, 33% of all pelvic fractures are missed by pelvic x-ray. Our present study suggests that pelvic x-ray may be of limited value in this context. It could be studied if the missed fractures are of minor importance compared to the ones detected. Patients who suffer pelvic fractures are usually the victims of trauma and often have other trauma-related injuries. Up to 52% of emergency department patients with pelvic fractures develop shock due to hemorrhage and despite the escalating role of computed tomography in trauma, conventional radiography remains important in the acute management of trauma patients. Current ATLS guidelines recommend that only chest, pelvis and lateral cervical spine are x-rayed immediately. Inherent delays, relatively high radiation dose and practical difficulties in acquiring radiographs in the multi-injured patient can adversely affect management, bearing in mind the critical importance of physician access to badly injured patients during the "golden hour".

Conventional pelvic radiography has a radiation of up to 20% of that of a spiral CT of the region, so radiation reduction by omission of conventional studies is significant. The potential cost reduction of omitting pelvic x-rays routinely is also significant.

Abdominal injuries influence the diagnostic procedures in blunt trauma. Focused assessment with sonography in trauma (FAST), introduced a decade ago, is non invasive and has high sensitivity but low specificity for the detection of free fluid and visceral damage. This may have an impact on treatment and outcome in trauma patients. CT remains the diagnostic study of choice at most institutions even in the evaluation of hemodynamically stable, blunt abdominal trauma. It is highly specific and sensitive in the detection and definition of the extent of most intra-abdominal and also pelvic injuries but requires the patient to be hemodynamically stable according to ATLS principles.

### Determining need for imaging in young children after a fall… [^01ab4271]. AAFP (1999). Low credibility.

Medical records were reviewed for children younger than two years of age who were discharged from a Boston children's hospital with a diagnosis of head injury, skull fracture, intracranial injury, cerebral contusion or cerebral edema. Excluded from the study were children with a history of seizures, blood dyscrasias, neurologic disorders, ventricular shunts or suspected abuse. Historic information included the estimated height of the fall, level of consciousness and presence of scalp abnormalities, and whether the child was referred by another physician or came directly to the emergency department. When skull radiographs or cranial computed tomographic scans were obtained, these results were also noted. Children were diagnosed with a "minor head injury" if they had a normal neurologic examination and were alert at discharge, and if radiologic studies were normal. A total of 291 patients were evaluated; medical records were available for 278 patients.

Most of these children had gone directly to the emergency department. Approximately 60 percent of the children were younger than 12 months of age; 40 percent were between 13 and 24 months of age. Eighty-two percent of all children were ultimately given a diagnosis of minor head injury, and 18 percent were diagnosed with a skull fracture or an intracranial injury. The authors conclude from their data that the incidence of serious head injury from a fall is greatest in children younger than 12 months of age. Many children who apparently have minor falls may have sustained significant head injury, even in the absence of clinical signs and symptoms. Physicians should have a low threshold for ordering imaging studies in children who have fallen. A CT scan could appropriately be ordered, but a skull radiograph may be acceptable in some situations because it is easier to perform and does not require sedation.

The authors report that children who fall 3 ft or less and have normal results on scalp examination and no history of neurologic symptoms do not need radiologic evaluation. editor's note: This study seems to dispel the notion held by many physicians that if a child does not lose consciousness, the chance of a serious head injury is very small. In addition, many children with minor head injuries may exhibit behavior changes and vomiting. It appears that exercising clinical judgment and maintaining close follow-up is still prudent. In addition, there should be a very low threshold for ordering a cranial CT scan in a child under one year of age who has fallen. Obviously, more studies are needed to better define historic and clinical criteria for diagnostic imaging. — j. t. k.

Skeletal survey — suspected intentional injury in children outlines age-specific imaging. Additionally perform a skeletal survey on siblings and household contacts of children with documented intentional injury who are 24-months-old and younger. Among children 2 years and older who are able to verbalize areas of injury and in whom a suspicion of intentional injury exists, focus initial imaging on the body regions of concern, and consider a skeletal survey in this older group to document the presence or absence of injuries, or when unexplained head injuries, abdominal injuries, or suspicious fractures are identified. Radiologic findings with greater specificity for intentional injury relate to the shaking mechanism of injury and include classic metaphyseal corner fractures and fractures of the ribs and spinous processes; other suspicious radiologic findings include epiphyseal separation injuries, sternal and scapular fractures, and multiple fractures of varying age.
