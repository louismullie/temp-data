## Question

A 45-year-old man with a history of poorly controlled human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection presents to the emergency room complaining of clumsiness and weakness. He reports a 3-month history of worsening balance, asymmetric muscle weakness, and speech difficulties. He recently returned from a trip to Guatemala to visit his family. He has been poorly compliant with his anti-retroviral therapy and his most recent CD4 count was 195. His history is also notable for rheumatoid arthritis and hepatitis C. His temperature is 99°F (37.2°C), blood pressure is 140/90 mmHg, pulse is 95/min, and respirations are 18/min. On exam, he has 4/5 strength in his right upper extremity, 5/5 strength in his left upper extremity, 5/5 strength in his right lower extremity, and 3/5 strength in his left lower extremity. His speech is disjointed with intermittent long pauses between words. Vision is 20/100 in the left eye and 20/40 in his right eye; previously, his eyesight was 20/30 bilaterally. This patient most likely has a condition caused by which of the following types of pathogens?
A. Arenavirus
B. Bunyavirus
C. Picornavirus
D. Polyomavirus

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which type of pathogen is most likely responsible for a 45-year-old man with poorly controlled HIV, a CD4 count of 195, and a 3-month history of progressive neurologic symptoms including asymmetric motor weakness, ataxia, aphasia, and visual changes, with answer choices of arenavirus, bunyavirus, picornavirus, or polyomavirus. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical syndrome and whether it fits a demyelinating process. Then, I should verify the immunologic context and which opportunistic CNS infections are most likely at this CD4 level. Next, I will review the differential diagnoses that could mimic this presentation and exclude them. Finally, I will match the most likely pathogen class to the clinical-radiologic syndrome and confirm the answer with guideline-based diagnostic criteria and management implications.

> Let me first confirm the clinical phenotype. The patient has a subacute, progressive course over about 3 months with focal neurologic deficits including right upper extremity weakness, left lower extremity weakness, ataxia, aphasia, and visual impairment, which aligns with a demyelinating process affecting multiple white matter territories rather than a single vascular territory stroke or a rapidly fulminant encephalitis, and this pattern is classic for progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) in the setting of HIV immunosuppression [^113dgqgm] [^111b28Hf].

> I need to check the immunologic risk context. With a CD4 count of 195 and poor ART adherence, he sits squarely in the range where JC virus (JCV) reactivation and PML risk rise, and before widespread ART, PML occurred in roughly 3% to 7% of patients with AIDS. Importantly, PML can still occur after ART initiation, sometimes as immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome, so the timing relative to ART matters for interpretation of imaging and symptoms [^116tWU57] [^1114rwX4].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should review key mimics and exclude them. Toxoplasma encephalitis typically presents with contrast-enhancing ring lesions and responds to anti-Toxoplasma therapy, which does not match the expected nonenhancing demyelinating PML lesions and the indolent progression here, though I should confirm with imaging and CSF if needed [^116eHpkU]. Cryptococcal meningitis can cause visual compromise but usually presents with headache, meningeal signs, and elevated intracranial pressure rather than focal demyelinating deficits, and IRIS considerations would differ from this picture, so this is less likely to explain the constellation of asymmetric motor and language deficits [^notfound]. Malaria can cause neurologic disease but would not produce a focal demyelinating syndrome like this, and the travel history alone does not override the stronger fit of PML in this immunocompromised host [^notfound]. CMV encephalitis tends to occur at much lower CD4 counts and has different imaging and CSF features, making it a poorer fit here [^116Yk1oJ].

> Let me consider the pathogen taxonomy next. JC virus is a human polyomavirus that establishes lifelong latent infection and, upon severe cellular immunosuppression, reactivates to cause PML with progressive demyelination. None of the other options (arenavirus, bunyavirus, picornavirus) are established causes of PML, which strengthens the case for polyomavirus as the correct answer class [^116tWU57] [^113mF2tt].

> I should confirm the expected diagnostic approach to solidify this. MRI typically shows multifocal nonenhancing T2/FLAIR hyperintense white matter lesions with T1 hypointensity and absent mass effect, and diffusion restriction at lesion edges can be seen; CSF JCV DNA PCR provides laboratory confirmation in most untreated cases, with sensitivity around 70% to 90% and high specificity, and if CSF PCR is negative but suspicion remains high, repeat testing or brain biopsy can be considered per diagnostic criteria [^112JADaC] [^111nKhQ9] [^112hF6Ld].

> Wait, let me verify management implications because they reinforce the diagnosis. There is no effective direct antiviral therapy for JCV; the cornerstone is immediate initiation or optimization of ART to restore cellular immunity, with close neurologic and imaging follow-up, and corticosteroids reserved for PML-IRIS when inflammatory edema worsens symptoms; this ART-first strategy and the lack of specific antivirals are hallmark features of HIV-associated PML management and further support polyomavirus as the causative class here [^1151K863] [^114dkUxZ] [^115pttJg].

> Putting this together, the clinical syndrome, immunologic context, imaging expectations, and guideline-based diagnostic and therapeutic framework all converge on JC polyomavirus as the etiologic class, making the correct answer D. Polyomavirus [^113dgqgm] [^116tWU57].

---

The patient's progressive, asymmetric neurologic deficits with visual and speech involvement in the setting of advanced HIV (CD4 195) are most consistent with **progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML)** [^113dgqgm], caused by reactivation of the JC polyomavirus [^116tWU57]. PML is a demyelinating CNS disease that occurs in immunocompromised hosts, especially with low CD4 counts, and presents with focal deficits, ataxia, aphasia, and visual field defects [^111b28Hf]. The other options (arenavirus, bunyavirus, picornavirus) do not match this clinical picture or epidemiology [^notfound].

---

## Clinical features and epidemiology of PML

- **Pathogen**: JC polyomavirus (JCV), a ubiquitous human polyomavirus [^116tWU57]; primary infection is usually asymptomatic, and latency is established in the kidneys and lymphoid tissues [^116tWU57].

- **Pathogenesis**: Reactivation occurs with severe immunosuppression (e.g. HIV with CD4 < 200, transplant recipients, or immunomodulatory therapies) [^116tWU57], leading to demyelination and progressive neurologic deficits [^113dgqgm].

- **Clinical presentation**: Insidious onset of focal neurologic deficits — hemiparesis, ataxia, aphasasia, visual field defects, and cognitive decline — progressing over weeks to months [^113dgqgm] [^111b28Hf].

- **Imaging**: MRI shows multifocal non-enhancing white matter lesions (T2/FLAIR hyperintense, T1 hypointense) without mass effect; enhancement suggests immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) [^112JADaC] [^112YQ1nT].

- **Diagnosis**: Clinical and MRI findings plus CSF JCV PCR [^111nKhQ9]; brain biopsy is reserved for inconclusive cases [^111nKhQ9].

---

## Differential diagnosis and exclusion of other pathogens

| **Pathogen** | **Clinical features** | **Relevance to case** |
|-|-|-|
| Arenavirus (e.g. Lassa) | Hemorrhagic fever, encephalitis | Not consistent with chronic, progressive demyelination [^notfound] |
| Bunyavirus (e.g. La Crosse) | Encephalitis, seizures | Acute course, not chronic progressive [^notfound] |
| Picornavirus (e.g. enteroviruses) | Acute flaccid paralysis, meningitis | Acute course, not chronic progressive [^notfound] |
| Polyomavirus (JCV) | Progressive demyelination, focal deficits | Highly consistent with case [^113dgqgm] |

---

## Management and prognosis

- **Management**: Immediate ART initiation or optimization to restore immunity [^1151K863]; no proven direct antiviral therapy exists [^1159Hfw2].

- **Prognosis**: Improved survival with ART, but high rates of residual disability; mortality remains significant, especially with low CD4 counts [^113JChGs].

---

The patient's clinical picture is most consistent with **PML due to JC polyomavirus reactivation** [^116tWU57] in advanced HIV. The other options do not fit the chronic, progressive demyelinating course seen here [^113dgqgm].

5.2 Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy

Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) has occurred in patients with MS treated with TECFIDERA. PML is an opportunistic viral infection of the brain caused by the JC virus (JCV) that typically only occurs in patients who are immunocompromised, and that usually leads to death or severe disability. A fatal case of PML occurred in a patient who received TECFIDERA for 4 years while enrolled in a clinical trial. During the clinical trial, the patient experienced prolonged lymphopenia (lymphocyte counts predominantly < 0.5x109/L for 3.5 years) while taking TECFIDERA [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. The patient had no other identified systemic medical conditions resulting in compromised immune system function and had not previously been treated with natalizumab, which has a known association with PML. The patient was also not taking any immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory medications concomitantly.

PML has also occurred in the postmarketing setting in the presence of lymphopenia (< 0.9x109/L). While the role of lymphopenia in these cases is uncertain, the PML cases have occurred predominantly in patients with lymphocyte counts < 0.8x109/L persisting for more than 6 months.

At the first sign or symptom suggestive of PML, withhold TECFIDERA and perform an appropriate diagnostic evaluation. Typical symptoms associated with PML are diverse, progress over days to weeks, and include progressive weakness on one side of the body or clumsiness of limbs, disturbance of vision, and changes in thinking, memory, and orientation leading to confusion and personality changes.

MRI findings may be apparent before clinical signs or symptoms. Cases of PML, diagnosed based on MRI findings and the detection of JCV DNA in the cerebrospinal fluid in the absence of clinical signs or symptoms specific to PML, have been reported in patients treated with other MS medications associated with PML. Many of these patients subsequently became symptomatic with PML. Therefore, monitoring with MRI for signs that may be consistent with PML may be useful, and any suspicious findings should lead to further investigation to allow for an early diagnosis of PML, if present. Lower PML-related mortality and morbidity have been reported following discontinuation of another MS medication associated with PML in patients with PML who were initially asymptomatic compared to patients with PML who had characteristic clinical signs and symptoms at diagnosis. It is not known whether these differences are due to early detection and discontinuation of MS treatment or due to differences in disease in these patients.

Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) clinical manifestations in children: PML is the primary disease caused by JC virus (JCV), clinical manifestations in children are similar to those in adults, and asymptomatic urinary shedding is common. The disease has an insidious onset and produces a neurologic syndrome that steadily progresses over weeks or months, characterized by confusion, disorientation, lack of energy, loss of balance, cognitive dysfunction, dementia, seizures, ataxia, aphasia, cranial nerve deficits, visual abnormalities (blurred or double vision or loss of vision), hemiparesis or quadriparesis, and eventually coma. Demyelination is initially patchy in subcortical regions and then spreads to deep white matter in a confluent pattern, so PML may initially present with focal neurologic deficits that involve different brain regions.

Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) epidemiology — PML is described as a rare demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS) that occurs in immunocompromised patients. In HIV-infected adults, CD4 T lymphocyte (CD4) cell counts less than 100 cells/mm3 are associated with development of PML, and persistence of CD4 counts less than 50 to 100 cells/mm3 are associated with fatal PML, although PML has been reported in HIV-infected patients with high CD4 counts who are receiving successful combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). Most humans are infected with JC virus (JCV) early in life, with 50% of Swedish children seropositive by ages 9 to 11 years and 72% of adult women aged ≥ 25 years in the Finnish Maternity Cohort seropositive; vertical transmission from mother to newborn also has been documented.

Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) monitoring and immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) — patients may develop PML before starting cART or may manifest PML as an unmasking IRIS event after immune reconstitution with antiretroviral therapy (ART). Neurologic stability or improvement and prolonged survival are associated with reduced levels of JCV DNA in CSF, appearance of JCV-specific antibody in CSF, and presence of JCV-specific cytotoxic T-cell responses in patients receiving cART. After cART is initiated and CD4 counts rise, some patients will experience neurologic improvement; however, reports have documented worsening neurologic manifestations after initiation of ART.

Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) in children with HIV — IRIS recognition and steroid use: Apparent worsening after starting combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) may be a paradoxical inflammatory reaction called immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS), and inflammatory PML should be suspected in cART-treated children with advanced HIV who show acute neurologic deterioration and contrast-enhancing demyelinating lesions on MRI, even if immunological and virological measures show improvement. Retrospective data suggest that early and prolonged treatment with steroids may be beneficial for some patients in whom immune reconstitution with ART activates an inflammatory response to JCV, but no clinical trial data exist to substantiate the anecdotal evidence.

Paradoxical tuberculosis immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (TB-IRIS) in adults with HIV-associated tuberculosis initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART) has a pooled incidence of 18% with death attributed in 2% of cases. The onset of paradoxical TB-IRIS symptoms is typically between 1 to 4 weeks after ART is initiated, and the syndrome lasts for 2 to 3 months on average, but may continue for several more months and, in rare cases, persist or recur over a year after onset. Common and important manifestations include fevers, new or enlarging lymphadenopathy, and new or worsening pulmonary infiltrates, and mortality due to paradoxical TB-IRIS is uncommon.

Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) diagnosis — key findings and tests: Seizures occur in nearly 20% of PML cases and are associated with lesions immediately adjacent to the cortex. Brain imaging with magnetic resonance (MR) or computed tomography is critical to identifying PML; typical lesions are hyperintense on T2-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery sequences and hypointense on T1-weighted sequences, and contrast enhancement is present in 10% to 15% of cases. Advanced imaging may aid diagnosis: diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) shows new or advancing lesions with a high signal and a normal-to-low apparent diffusion coefficient, and MR spectroscopy can show decreased N-acetylaspartate with increased choline. In most cases the combined clinical and radiographic presentations support a presumptive diagnosis; confirmation commonly uses cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for JC virus (JCV) DNA, which is positive in approximately 70% to 90% of patients not taking antiretroviral therapy (ART) and detectable in the CSF of as few as 60% of ART-treated patients; CSF analysis can be repeated if JCV PCR is negative yet suspicion remains high and alternative diagnoses have been excluded.

Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy

Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is an opportunistic viral infection of the brain caused by the JC virus (JCV) that typically only occurs in patients who are immunocompromised, and that usually leads to death or severe disability. Typical symptoms associated with PML are diverse, progress over days to weeks, and include progressive weakness on one side of the body or clumsiness of limbs, disturbance of vision, and changes in thinking, memory, and orientation leading to confusion and personality changes.

PML has been reported in patients treated with S1P receptor modulators and other multiple sclerosis (MS) therapies and has been associated with some risk factors (e.g., immunocompromised patients, polytherapy with immunosuppressants). Physicians should be vigilant for clinical symptoms or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings that may be suggestive of PML. MRI findings may be apparent before clinical signs or symptoms. If PML is suspected, treatment with PONVORY should be suspended until PML has been excluded.

If PML is confirmed, treatment with PONVORY should be discontinued.

Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) has been reported in patients treated with S1P receptor modulators who developed PML and subsequently discontinued treatment. IRIS presents as a clinical decline in the patient's condition that may be rapid, can lead to serious neurological complications or death, and is often associated with characteristic changes on MRI. The time to onset of IRIS in patients with PML was generally within a few months after S1P receptor modulator discontinuation. Monitoring for development of IRIS and appropriate treatment of the associated inflammation should be undertaken.

Prior and Concomitant Treatment with Anti-neoplastic, Immune-Modulating, or Immunosuppressive Therapies

Anti-neoplastic, immune-modulating, or immunosuppressive therapies (including corticosteroids) should be coadministered with caution because of the risk of additive immune system effects [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

4 Discussion

In this study, we observed the differences in visual function and ocular symptoms between the vision change and non‐vision change groups among HNC patients after their cancer treatments. Compared with the non‐vision change group, HNC patients in the vision change group were significantly younger and had more steroid treatment. The vision change group had significantly decreased visual function and experienced worse ocular symptoms than the non‐vision change group. Both groups suffered in general health and general vision, but the vision change group had significantly worse general vision than the non‐vision change group. The vision change group also had significantly worse visual functions than the non‐vision change group, including near activities, distance activities, vision‐specific functions, color vision, and peripheral vision. Similarly, the vision change group had worse ocular symptoms than the non‐vision change group, including ocular pain, tearing, dryness in the eyes, double vision, blurry vision, eye tiredness, vision‐related headaches, and objects jumping around.

The differences in the NEI‐VFQ 25 scores between the vision change and non‐vision change groups were statistically, conceptually, and clinically significant. NEI‐VFQ 25 is one of the most commonly used patient‐reported outcome (PRO) measures in ophthalmology studies. NEI‐VFQ 25 assesses visual disability and health‐related quality of life. The questionnaire includes a general health construct and visual functioning subscales. NEI‐VFQ 25 addresses the domains defined by the World Health Organization's International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (WHO‐ICF) to quantify health‐related outcomes. Content analysis mapping of NEI‐VFQ 25 in a previous study resulted in three content domains aligned with WHO‐ICF, including visual function impairment (F), activity (A), and participation (P) (F, A, P). In our study, the vision change group had significantly worse scores than the non‐vision change group in eight F, A, P subscales (Table 2). The only F, A, P subscale without a statistical difference between the groups was driving, but the p value was close to 0.05 (p = 0.074). In the literature, the minimally important difference (MID) of NEI‐VFQ 25 composite scores between two independent groups for clinical interpretation was 3.9. The difference in composite scores between the vision change and non‐vision change groups in our study was 9.76, which far exceeded the MID.

Cryptococcal immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) — general management includes continuing antiretroviral therapy and, for severe symptoms, considering anti-inflammatory therapy. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) should be continued, and although many cases resolve spontaneously, some experts have used anti-inflammatory therapy (e.g., short-course corticosteroids) in patients with severely symptomatic IRIS (CIII).

Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) immunomodulatory therapies in HIV — treatment of PML with IL-2 is not recommended (BIII). Use of checkpoint inhibitors for PML in the setting of HIV is not recommended (BIII), and in summary, immunomodulatory agents are not recommended (BIII). Across the several small case series published to date, a single patient with HIV-associated PML was treated with benefit, but use of disease-specific T cells is actively being explored, and at present cannot be recommended for HIV-associated PML.

Cross-sectional analyses of tandem assessments

All participants had T2-FLAIR and T1WI in their pULF-MRI acquisition protocol, whereas DWI was acquired in 6 of 11 patients. T2-weighted imaging (T2WI) was included in 4 of 11 cases, as initial observations suggested no significant additional benefit to justify the longer acquisition time required for T2WI. Mean (± SD) acquisition time for pULF-MRI was 30 (± 7) min. Ten of eleven (90%) cases had T2-FLAIR hyperintense lesions on HF-MRI. In these cases, the primary radiological diagnosis was established by the presence of predominantly confluent T2-FLAIR lesions. In addition, there were smaller scattered lesions observed, which are PML-related satellite lesions and/or unrelated findings. One case presented with isolated cerebellar atrophy without WML, leading to a diagnosis of GCN, and had a corresponding pattern on the pULF-MRI scan (Supplemental Fig. 2).

All cases with T2-FLAIR hyperintense lesions on HF-MRI (10/11) exhibited detectable hyperintense lesions on pULF-MRI T2-FLAIR corresponding to the primary confluent T2-FLAIR-hyperintense regions that initially prompted the patients' diagnosis. 8/11 (72%) patients had T1WI hypointensity within the PML lesions on their HF-MRI images. This was visible on pULF-MRI in seven of eight (87%) cases. Representative images showing T2-FLAIR hyperintense PML lesions with T1WI hypointensity are shown in Fig. 1.

Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) outcomes and prognostic factors on ART: In one retrospective study of 118 consecutive patients with PML who received ART, 75 patients (63.6%) survived for a median of 114 weeks (2.2 years) after diagnosis of PML. Another retrospective case series reported that 42% of PML survivors on ART had moderate or severe disability. Peripheral blood CD4 count at presentation was the only variable that predicted survival; the odds ratio for death was 2.7 among patients with CD4 counts < 100 cells/mm3 compared with patients who had higher CD4 counts. In other case series, worse prognosis also was associated with high plasma HIV RNA levels at the time of presentation, poor virologic responses to ART, and presence of lesions in the brain stem, while contrast enhancement on imaging may predict better outcomes. In multiple sclerosis patients with PML, younger age, more restricted unilobar disease, and lower CSF JCV DNA copy numbers are associated with better outcomes; whether these associations are true for PML in PWH is unknown.

Malaria — traveler risk and prophylaxis considerations include that many foreign-born individuals develop malaria in the United States because of distant exposure before arrival or from more recent travel, and U.S.-born individuals can develop malaria during travel to endemic areas; failure to take appropriate chemoprophylaxis is a common problem for both groups and people who formerly lived in malarious areas may believe they are immune and do not need prophylaxis. Such patients are at high risk of infection because they likely have lost partial immunity within 6 months after leaving endemic regions. In returning travelers who are febrile, of the nearly 50 million individuals who travel to developing countries each year, between 5% and 11% develop a fever during or after travel, and malaria is a surprisingly common cause of these fevers.

Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) clinical manifestations — PML manifests as focal neurological deficits, usually with insidious onset and steady progression, and because demyelinating lesions can involve different brain regions, specific deficits vary from patient to patient; any region of the central nervous system can be involved, including the occipital lobes (hemianopsia), frontal and parietal lobes (aphasia, hemiparesis, and hemisensory deficits), and cerebellar peduncles and deep white matter (dysmetria and ataxia). Spinal cord involvement is rare, and the optic nerves are not involved; although lesions can be multiple, one lesion is clinically predominant, with initial symptoms typically beginning as partial deficits that worsen over time as lesions expand, while less localized syndromes such as behavioral changes, dementia, or encephalopathy are rarely the presenting phenotype. The time course often helps distinguish PML, with clinical progression over several weeks compared with other opportunistic focal brain disorders that characteristically progress in hours to days.

Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy

Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is an opportunistic viral infection of the brain caused by the JC virus (JCV) that typically only occurs in patients who are immunocompromised, and that usually leads to death or severe disability. Typical symptoms associated with PML are diverse, progress over days to weeks, and include progressive weakness on one side of the body or clumsiness of limbs, disturbance of vision, and changes in thinking, memory, and orientation leading to confusion and personality changes.

No case of PML has been reported in clinical studies of cladribine in patients with multiple sclerosis. In patients treated with parenteral cladribine for oncologic indications, cases of PML have been reported in the postmarketing setting.

Obtain a baseline (within 3 months) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) before initiating the first treatment course of MAVENCLAD. At the first sign or symptom suggestive of PML, withhold MAVENCLAD and perform an appropriate diagnostic evaluation. MRI findings may be apparent before clinical signs or symptoms.

Vaccinations

Administer all immunizations (except as noted for VZV) according to immunization guidelines prior to starting MAVENCLAD. Administer live-attenuated or live vaccines at least 4 to 6 weeks prior to starting MAVENCLAD, because of a risk of active vaccine infection (see Herpes Virus Infections). Avoid vaccination with live-attenuated or live vaccines during and after MAVENCLAD treatment while the patient's white blood cell counts are not within normal limits.

5.3	Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML)

Cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) have been reported in patients with MS treated with OCREVUS in the postmarketing setting. PML is an opportunistic viral infection of the brain caused by the JC virus (JCV) that typically only occurs in patients who are immunocompromised, and that usually leads to death or severe disability. PML has occurred in OCREVUS-treated patients who had not been treated previously with natalizumab (which has a known association with PML), were not taking any immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory medications associated with the risk of PML prior to or concomitantly with OCREVUS, and did not have any known ongoing systemic medical conditions resulting in compromised immune system function.

JCV infection resulting in PML has also been observed in patients treated with other anti-CD20 antibodies and other MS therapies.

At the first sign or symptom suggestive of PML, withhold OCREVUS and perform an appropriate diagnostic evaluation. Typical symptoms associated with PML are diverse, progress over days to weeks, and include progressive weakness on one side of the body or clumsiness of limbs, disturbance of vision, and changes in thinking, memory, and orientation leading to confusion and personality changes.

MRI findings may be apparent before clinical signs or symptoms. Cases of PML, diagnosed based on MRI findings and the detection of JCV DNA in the cerebrospinal fluid in the absence of clinical signs or symptoms specific to PML, have been reported in patients treated with other MS medications associated with PML. Many of these patients subsequently became symptomatic with PML. Therefore, monitoring with MRI for signs that may be consistent with PML may be useful, and any suspicious findings should lead to further investigation to allow for an early diagnosis of PML, if present. Following discontinuation of another MS medication associated with PML, lower PML-related mortality and morbidity have been reported in patients who were initially asymptomatic at diagnosis compared to patients who had characteristic clinical signs and symptoms at diagnosis.

It is not known whether these differences are due to early detection and discontinuation of MS treatment or due to differences in disease in these patients.

If PML is confirmed, treatment with OCREVUS should be discontinued.

Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) diagnosis: Established clinical diagnostic criteria are focal signs and symptoms on neurologic examination, focal white matter lesions on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computerized tomography (CT) without mass effect, and exclusion of other causes of the clinical and neuroradiologic findings. A confirmed diagnosis requires a compatible clinical syndrome and radiographic findings with brain biopsy demonstrating a characteristic triad of pathologic foci of demyelination, enlarged hyperchromatic oligodendrocytes with enlarged nuclei and basophilic-staining intranuclear material, and enlarged astrocytes with bizarre hyperchromatic nuclei; when only two features are present, JCV can be demonstrated by in situ hybridization or by electron microscopy for definitive diagnosis. Brain biopsy remains the gold standard confirmatory test for diagnosis of PML, but MRI or CT can reveal characteristic lesions.

### HIV… [^117HhdiJ]. Wikipedia (2001). Low credibility.

The human immunodeficiency viruses are two species of Lentivirus that infect humans. Over time, they cause acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, a condition in which progressive failure of the immune system allows life-threatening opportunistic infections and cancers to thrive. Without treatment, the average survival time after infection with HIV is estimated to be 9 to 11 years, depending on the HIV subtype. HIV infects vital cells in the human immune system, such as helper T cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells. HIV infection leads to low levels of CD4^+^ T cells through a number of mechanisms, including pyroptosis of abortively infected T cells, apoptosis of uninfected bystander cells, direct viral killing of infected cells, and killing of infected CD4^+^ T cells by CD8^+^ cytotoxic lymphocytes that recognize infected cells.

When CD4^+^ T cell numbers decline below a critical level, cell-mediated immunity is lost, and the body becomes progressively more susceptible to opportunistic infections, leading to the development of AIDS. Once integrated, the virus may become latent, allowing the virus and its host cell to avoid detection by the immune system, for an indeterminate amount of time. The virus can remain dormant in the human body for up to ten years after primary infection; during this period the virus does not cause symptoms. Alternatively, the integrated viral DNA may be transcribed, producing new RNA genomes and viral proteins, using host cell resources, that are packaged and released from the cell as new virus particles that will begin the replication cycle anew. This CCR5 co-receptor is used by almost all primary HIV-1 isolates regardless of viral genetic subtype. Indeed, macrophages play a key role in several critical aspects of HIV infection.

They appear to be the first cells infected by HIV and perhaps the source of HIV production when CD4^+^ cells become depleted in the patient. Macrophages and microglial cells are the cells infected by HIV in the central nervous system. In the tonsils and adenoids of HIV-infected patients, macrophages fuse into multinucleated giant cells that produce huge amounts of virus. However, the use of co-receptors alone does not explain viral tropism, as not all R5 viruses are able to use CCR5 on macrophages for a productive infection and HIV can also infect a subtype of myeloid dendritic cells, which probably constitute a reservoir that maintains infection when CD4^+^ T cell numbers have declined to extremely low levels. Some people are resistant to certain strains of HIV. For example, people with the CCR5-Δ32 mutation are resistant to infection by the R5 virus, as the mutation leaves HIV unable to bind to this co-receptor, reducing its ability to infect target cells.

In patients infected with subtype B HIV-1, there is often a co-receptor switch in late-stage disease and T-tropic variants that can infect a variety of T cells through CXCR4. These variants then replicate more aggressively with heightened virulence that causes rapid T cell depletion, immune system collapse, and opportunistic infections that mark the advent of AIDS. HIV-positive patients acquire an enormously broad spectrum of opportunistic infections, which was particularly problematic prior to the onset of HAART therapies; however, the same infections are reported among HIV-infected patients examined post-mortem following the onset of antiretroviral therapies. Thus, during the course of infection, viral adaptation to the use of CXCR4 instead of CCR5 may be a key step in the progression to AIDS. A number of studies with subtype B-infected individuals have determined that between 40 and 50 percent of AIDS patients can harbour viruses of the SI and, it is presumed, the X4 phenotypes.

Toxoplasma encephalitis (TE) imaging and lumbar puncture guidance note that on imaging studies toxoplasmosis presents as contrast-enhancing lesions (typically ring-enhancing) with a predilection for the basal ganglia, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has sensitivity superior to that of computed tomography (CT) and should be obtained in patients with equivocal or negative CT studies. Positron emission tomography or single-photon emission CT scanning may be helpful in distinguishing between TE and primary central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma, but no imaging technique is completely specific. If safe and feasible, a lumbar puncture should be performed for T. gondii PCR, as well as for cytology, culture, cryptococcal antigen, and PCR for Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), and JC virus (JCV), and PCR for cytomegalovirus and varicella-zoster virus, as well as testing for syphilis, may also be considered. Detection of T. gondii by PCR in CSF has high specificity (96% to 100%), but low sensitivity (50% to 60%), especially once specific anti-Toxoplasma therapy has been started; in tissue, hematoxylin and eosin stains can be used for detection of T. gondii in biopsies, but sensitivity is significantly increased if immunoperoxidase staining is used and if experienced laboratorians process the specimens.

HIV-associated progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) — diagnosis: Because JC virus (JCV) DNA in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) may be very low, highly sensitive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays are desirable; sensitive assays that detect as few as 50 copies/mL are now available, and detection of JCV virus in CSF in any amount with the appropriate clinical and imaging findings strongly supports the diagnosis of PML. Plasma JCV PCR, when positive, is relatively specific for PML (~92% in patients with HIV), while the sensitivity is less than 40% in this setting. In some instances, brain biopsy is required in order to rule out other diagnoses, with identification of JCV or cross-reacting polyoma virus by immunohistochemistry, in situ nucleic acid hybridization, or electron microscopy. Generally, serologic testing is not useful because of high anti-JCV seroprevalence in the general population; however, antibody testing has been assessed for stratifying risk of PML with natalizumab treatment, and significant increases in JCV-specific antibody titers and detection of intrathecally produced anti-JCV antibodies may prove useful for diagnostic testing but require further prospective study.

PML–immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (PML-IRIS) — PML has been reported to occur within the first weeks to months after initiating ART with clinical and radiographic features that differ from classical PML, including lesions with contrast enhancement, edema and mass effect, and a more rapid clinical course. As with other presentations of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS), it is more likely after advanced HIV with low CD4 counts and greater decline in HIV viral load on initiation of ARV. This presentation has been referred to as inflammatory PML or PML-IRIS. Both unmasking of cryptic PML and paradoxical worsening in a patient with an established PML diagnosis have been observed. Histopathology typically demonstrates perivascular mononuclear inflammatory infiltration.

### HIV / AIDS… [^116U4DqY]. Wikipedia (2001). Low credibility.

The human immunodeficiency virus is a retrovirus that attacks the immune system. Without treatment, it can lead to a spectrum of conditions including acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. It is a preventable disease. It can be managed with treatment and become a manageable chronic health condition. While there is no cure or vaccine for HIV, antiretroviral treatment can slow the course of the disease, and if used before significant disease progression, can extend the life expectancy of someone living with HIV to a nearly standard level. An HIV-positive person on treatment can expect to live a normal life, and die with the virus, not of it. Effective treatment for HIV-positive people involves a life-long regimen of medicine to suppress the virus, making the viral load undetectable. Treatment is recommended as soon as the diagnosis is made.

An HIV-positive person who has an undetectable viral load as a result of long-term treatment has effectively no risk of transmitting HIV sexually. Campaigns by UNAIDS and organizations around the world have communicated this as Undetectable = Untransmittable. Without treatment the infection can interfere with the immune system, and eventually progress to AIDS, sometimes taking many years. Following initial infection an individual may not notice any symptoms, or may experience a brief period of influenza-like illness. During this period the person may not know that they are HIV-positive, yet they will be able to pass on the virus. Typically, this period is followed by a prolonged incubation period with no symptoms. Eventually the HIV infection increases the risk of developing other infections such as tuberculosis, as well as other opportunistic infections, and tumors which are rare in people who have normal immune function.

The late stage is often also associated with unintended weight loss. Without treatment a person living with HIV can expect to live for 11 years. Early testing can show if treatment is needed to stop this progression and to prevent infecting others. First main stage: acute infection The initial period following infection with HIV is called acute HIV, primary HIV or acute retroviral syndrome. Many individuals develop an influenza-like illness, mononucleosis or glandular fever 2–4 weeks after exposure while others have no significant symptoms. Symptoms occur in 40–90% of cases and most commonly include fever, large tender lymph nodes, throat inflammation, a rash, headache, tiredness, and/or sores of the mouth and genitals. The rash, which occurs in 20–50% of cases, presents itself on the trunk and is maculopapular, classically. Some people also develop opportunistic infections at this stage. Gastrointestinal symptoms, such as vomiting or diarrhea may occur.

Neurological symptoms of peripheral neuropathy or Guillain–Barré syndrome also occur. The duration of the symptoms varies, but is usually one or two weeks. Second main stage: clinical latency The initial symptoms are followed by a stage called clinical latency, asymptomatic HIV, or chronic HIV. Without treatment, this second stage of the natural history of HIV infection can last from about three years to over 20 years. While typically there are few or no symptoms at first, near the end of this stage many people experience fever, weight loss, gastrointestinal problems and muscle pains. Between 50% and 70% of people also develop persistent generalized lymphadenopathy, characterized by unexplained, non-painful enlargement of more than one group of lymph nodes for over three to six months.

5.2 Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy

Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) has occurred in patients with MS treated with dimethyl fumarate delayed-release capsules. PML is an opportunistic viral infection of the brain caused by the JC virus (JCV) that typically only occurs in patients who are immunocompromised, and that usually leads to death or severe disability. A fatal case of PML occurred in a patient who received dimethyl fumarate delayed-release capsules for 4 years while enrolled in a clinical trial. During the clinical trial, the patient experienced prolonged lymphopenia (lymphocyte counts predominantly less than 0.5x109/L for 3.5 years) while taking dimethyl fumarate delayed-release capsules [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. The patient had no other identified systemic medical conditions resulting in compromised immune system function and had not previously been treated with natalizumab, which has a known association with PML. The patient was also not taking any immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory medications concomitantly.

PML has also occurred in the postmarketing setting in the presence of lymphopenia (less than 0.9x109/L). While the role of lymphopenia in these cases is uncertain, the PML cases have occurred predominantly in patients with lymphocyte counts less than 0.8x109/L persisting for more than 6 months.

At the first sign or symptom suggestive of PML, withhold dimethyl fumarate delayed-release capsules and perform an appropriate diagnostic evaluation. Typical symptoms associated with PML are diverse, progress over days to weeks, and include progressive weakness on one side of the body or clumsiness of limbs, disturbance of vision, and changes in thinking, memory, and orientation leading to confusion and personality changes.

MRI findings may be apparent before clinical signs or symptoms. Cases of PML, diagnosed based on MRI findings and the detection of JCV DNA in the cerebrospinal fluid in the absence of clinical signs or symptoms specific to PML, have been reported in patients treated with other MS medications associated with PML. Many of these patients subsequently became symptomatic with PML. Therefore, monitoring with MRI for signs that may be consistent with PML may be useful, and any suspicious findings should lead to further investigation to allow for an early diagnosis of PML, if present. Lower PML-related mortality and morbidity have been reported following discontinuation of another MS medication associated with PML in patients with PML who were initially asymptomatic compared to patients with PML who had characteristic clinical signs and symptoms at diagnosis. It is not known whether these differences are due to early detection and discontinuation of MS treatment or due to differences in disease in these patients.

Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) epidemiology — PML is an opportunistic infection of the central nervous system caused by JC virus (JCV) and characterized by focal demyelination; JCV has a worldwide distribution, and 20% to 70% of people exhibit serologic evidence of exposure by their late teens or as adults, with primary infection usually asymptomatic in childhood and viral DNA detected in the urine of 20% to 30% of healthy adults. PML is a rare manifestation of JCV reactivation occurring as a complication of HIV-1 infection and other immunocompromising diseases or therapies, including reports with immunomodulatory humanized antibodies such as natalizumab and efalizumab, and concern about possible increased risk in persons with HIV treated with rituximab for non-Hodgkin lymphoma, although PML has not been documented in that setting; PML can also occur during chronic immunosuppression after organ transplantation and often has a poor prognosis. Before combination antiretroviral therapy (ART), PML developed in 3% to 7% of patients with AIDS and was almost invariably fatal; with widespread ART use, incidence decreased substantially and mortality in persons with HIV who develop the disease has declined, yet PML still occurs occasionally despite CD4 T lymphocyte counts maintained above 100 to 200 cells/mm3 and can develop after ART initiation in the setting of immune reconstitution.

### Reemerging infectious diseases and neuroimmunologic complications [^115eKKUn]. Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

The main therapeutic approach to PML is to enhance the immune response against the virus. One approach is to use immune checkpoint inhibitors that can reverse T-cell exhaustion to regain their cytotoxic properties against the viral antigens. A similar approach has been successful in some cancers. However, this can only be successful if there are enough T cells to stimulate and they are exhausted as demonstrated by expression of the checkpoint molecules on their surface, in the absence of which such treatment may not be useful. Another alternative is to use cell-based therapy in which matched donor cells are stimulated in vitro with antigens that are homologous to BK virus and JC virus and then transfused into the patient intravenously.

Although immune stimulation is important to eliminate the virus, excessive immune reaction can be detrimental and result in an immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS), which needs to be controlled with anti-inflammatory agents. On MRI, PML-associated IRIS typically presents as enhancing lesions with either circumferential or nodular enhancement. However, a miliary form of IRIS has also been described. Some have advocated for the use of maraviroc, which is a CCR5 receptor antagonist, for treatment of IRIS, because it decreases macrophage and T-cell activation.

The progression of deficits usually leads to death or severe disability over weeks or months. Withhold TYSABRI dosing immediately and perform an appropriate diagnostic evaluation at the first sign or symptom suggestive of PML.

MRI findings may be apparent before clinical signs or symptoms. Cases of PML, diagnosed based on MRI findings and the detection of JCV DNA in the cerebrospinal fluid in the absence of clinical signs or symptoms specific to PML, have been reported.

Therefore, monitoring with MRI for signs that may be consistent with PML may be useful, and any suspicious findings should lead to further investigation to allow for an early diagnosis of PML, if present. Consider monitoring patients at high risk for PML more frequently. Lower PML-related mortality and morbidity have been reported following TYSABRI discontinuation in patients with PML who were initially asymptomatic compared to patients with PML who had characteristic clinical signs and symptoms at diagnosis. It is not known whether these differences are due to early detection and discontinuation of TYSABRI or due to differences in disease in these patients.

How is IBM distinct from the other IIMs?

IBM is distinct from the other forms of IIMs due to its characteristic clinical presentation and refractoriness to current pragmatic therapeutic strategies. In addition, the lack of efficacy shown in clinical trials of novel agents underscores the need to explore innovative pathomechanisms in IBM.

IBM is more common in men than in women with an age of onset typically 45 years or older and does not affect children. IBM presents a unique clinical phenotype characterized by slow-onset asymmetric weakness and atrophy, affecting both proximal and distal limb muscles. Notably, the deep finger flexors are preferentially involved at an early stage, along with knee extensors and ankle dorsiflexors, as well as the facial and pharyngeal muscles. However, it has become widely recognized that IBM may affect younger individuals and may present with weakness beyond finger flexors and knee extensors. Clinical heterogeneity and a lack of disease awareness are associated with an average diagnostic delay of 5–6 years, with the condition often being initially misdiagnosed. Various conditions can resemble IBM due to overlapping clinical features. Inflammation on muscle biopsy is a feature shared with other IIM, and IBM is often initially misdiagnosed as being another IIM. Of note, inflammation does not exclusively occur in IBM (and other IIMs) and can also be seen in muscular dystrophies, such as facioscapulohumeral dystrophy (FSHD), dystrophinopathies, dysferlinopathies, calpainopathies and anoctaminopathies. Subtypes of limb-girdle muscular dystrophies, such as anoctaminopathy, may exhibit asymmetrical muscle involvement. Myotonic dystrophy type 2 exhibits similarities to IBM, particularly affecting distal muscles. Likewise, neurogenic disorders such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Kennedy's disease (spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy) and certain forms of motor neuron disease (MND) can present initially with muscle weakness and atrophy that mirrors IBM's clinical presentation. A retrospective review by Dabby et al. found that 13% of their patients initially diagnosed with ALS or MND were later reclassified as having IBM. In addition, myofibrillar myopathies, characterized by abnormal protein aggregation in muscle fibres, share clinical features of weakness and atrophy with IBM.

HHV-6B encephalitis — diagnosis and empiric treatment states that diagnostic cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) testing should be performed without delay, and empiric treatment should be strongly considered when there is high suspicion while additional workup is ongoing (BIII). Early Infectious Diseases consultation is recommended to guide treatment. If CSF is negative for HHV-6B and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) does not show signs of encephalitis, the likelihood of HHV-6B encephalitis is low, and although HHV-6B DNA detection in the plasma is typical, diagnosis and treatment decisions should be based on CSF testing when possible. If workup is suggestive of HHV-6B encephalitis, treatment should be continued for at least 3 weeks and discontinued with clearance (or decrease below limit of quantification) of HHV-6B DNA from plasma and CSF, whichever is longer (AII).

### Portable ultra-low-field MRI for progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy: case studies, sensitivity, and potential applications [^112YQ1nT]. Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is a debilitating and often life-threatening infection of the central nervous system (CNS) caused by the human polyomavirus JC virus (JCV). Although it causes a latent, life-long asymptomatic infection in the immune-competent host, suppressed cellular immunity can lead to viral reactivation and PML. HIV-related PML accounts for most cases, with hematological malignancies and treatment with immunomodulatory or immunosuppressive therapies being the next most common associations.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a critical tool for in vivo diagnosis of PML for follow-up. Typical MRI findings of PML include multifocal hyperintense white matter lesions (WML) on T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (T2-FLAIR), mostly involving subcortical and juxtacortical white matter. These lesions are generally isointense and/or hypointense on T1-weighted images (T1WI) depending on the degree of tissue destruction and the type of T1WI. Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) hyperintensity at the leading edge of expanding lesions is common. When immune reconstitution is present, MRI can show contrast enhancement, edema, and mass effect, indicating inflammatory changes. Asymptomatic PML lesions, detectable through MRI, can develop before clinical symptoms appear or a formal diagnosis is made in natalizumab-treated patients. These lesions often exhibit localized growth, accompanied by edema and contrast enhancement, which may indicate underlying inflammation. JCV CNS infection spectrum can also manifest with granule cell neuronopathy (GCN), causing progressive cerebellar atrophy with or without associated white matter lesions, fulminant encephalopathy, and meningitis.
