## Question

A 38-year-old man presents to the respiratory clinic with a 9-month history of episodic wheezing, cough, and shortness of breath that improve on weekends and during holidays. He works as a spray painter in an automobile factory. Spirometry confirms reversible airflow obstruction, and peak flow monitoring shows a clear work-related pattern. Specific inhalation challenge testing confirms the diagnosis of occupational asthma due to isocyanate exposure.

According to current SIGN guidelines, what is the most appropriate advice regarding this patient's occupational exposure now that a diagnosis of work-related asthma has been confirmed?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what advice should be given to a 38-year-old spray painter with confirmed isocyanate-induced occupational asthma, according to current SIGN-aligned guidance. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the strength of the diagnostic evidence and how that influences management. Then, I should verify what SIGN and related guidelines say about exposure management, especially for isocyanates. Next, I will weigh the risks of continued exposure versus the potential consequences of job change. After that, I should consider whether exposure reduction is ever acceptable and under what safeguards. Finally, I will integrate pharmacologic management, follow-up, and documentation needs to ensure a complete, safe plan.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and its implications. The patient has classic sensitizer-induced occupational asthma due to isocyanates, confirmed by objective work-related airflow changes and a positive specific inhalation challenge, which is the reference standard when available, albeit used selectively due to safety and access constraints [^11f4b461] [^76700473]. Hold on, I should verify prognostic context: once sensitized to low-molecular-weight chemicals like isocyanates, extremely low exposures can trigger severe reactions, and continued exposure is associated with progression to persistent symptoms and irreversible airflow limitation, so the stakes for exposure decisions are high [^5df46de3] [^6dd418a5].

> Next, I should review guideline direction on exposure. SIGN-aligned guidance emphasizes early recognition and complete avoidance of the causal agent as the preferred strategy to maximize the chance of recovery, with explicit statements that persistence of exposure worsens outcomes and that complete avoidance offers the highest probability of improvement, even if not guaranteed [^645a2026] [^80dfa1de]. Wait, let me verify the isocyanate-specific language: multiple sources caution that for isocyanate-induced occupational asthma, relying on personal protective equipment or attempting exposure reduction is unsafe because severe reactions, including fatalities, have occurred despite medication and respirators, so removal from exposure is strongly recommended [^c54c6836] [^80dfa1de].

> I will now examine whether exposure reduction is ever acceptable. ERS guidance allows considering exposure reduction only when complete avoidance is not feasible, and even then it should not be first-line and requires close medical monitoring for deterioration; importantly, this caveat does not override the isocyanate-specific safety concerns noted above, so I need to be cautious not to overgeneralize this option to isocyanate cases [^6af16098] [^66e03278]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: while some comparative data suggest mixed outcomes with exposure reduction versus cessation, pooled analyses and systematic reviews indicate better outcomes with complete removal, reinforcing that cessation is preferred when feasible, especially in sensitizer-induced disease [^c8897456] [^80dbdaf2].

> Let me think about the balance of risks and benefits of job change. Continued isocyanate exposure risks progression to fixed obstruction and life-threatening reactions, whereas early removal offers the best chance of symptomatic and functional improvement, though recovery is variable and not universal; I should counsel that prognosis is better with shorter symptom duration at diagnosis, which supports prompt action here [^5df46de3] [^80dbdaf2]. I should double-check that this aligns with occupational health practice: expert reviews consistently advise complete avoidance as the cornerstone of management for sensitizer-induced occupational asthma, with pharmacotherapy layered on top for control, not as a substitute for exposure elimination [^b72a42a8] [^8a736386].

> Next, I should review pharmacologic management and follow-up. Standard asthma therapy should be optimized to achieve control, but medications do not mitigate the risk of ongoing sensitization or severe reactions from continued isocyanate exposure, so they complement rather than replace exposure avoidance; I need to ensure a written asthma action plan and close follow-up to track symptoms, lung function, and medication needs after exposure cessation [^25dd41b7] [^9a34ee58]. Wait, I should verify monitoring cadence: guidelines support periodic spirometry and symptom review after exposure change, with earlier reassessment if symptoms persist or worsen, which is prudent given variable recovery trajectories [^notfound].

> I should confirm documentation and referral steps. Given the medicolegal and socioeconomic implications, patients with confirmed occupational asthma should be referred for expert occupational health assessment and advice; I need to ensure the diagnosis, objective test results, and exposure details are clearly documented to support counseling, workers' compensation, and employer risk mitigation discussions [^6dd418a5] [^bcd189ef]. Hold on, I should verify that this referral is explicitly recommended in high-credibility guidance: yes, GINA and related statements consistently advise specialist referral for confirmed occupational asthma because of these complexities [^6dd418a5] [^bcd189ef].

> Putting this together, my recommendation is clear: the most appropriate advice is complete cessation of isocyanate exposure, ideally by changing jobs or implementing strict removal from exposure, because this strategy offers the highest probability of improvement and mitigates the risk of progression and severe reactions. Exposure reduction with ongoing monitoring is not an adequate or safe alternative in isocyanate-induced disease, and pharmacologic therapy should be optimized in parallel with close follow-up and specialist referral [^645a2026] [^c54c6836] [^6dd418a5]. I should emphasize that while recovery is variable, early removal maximizes chances of improvement, and continued exposure carries substantial and potentially life-threatening risks that cannot be reliably controlled with respirators or medication alone [^80dbdaf2] [^5df46de3].

The most appropriate advice is to **remove the patient from isocyanate exposure immediately** [^c54c6836] and **refer to an occupational asthma specialist** [^6dd418a5] for further evaluation and management. Continued exposure to isocyanates carries a high risk of persistent asthma, irreversible lung damage, and even death, and respiratory protection is not sufficient to prevent progression [^c54c6836] [^80dfa1de]. Pharmacologic asthma treatment should be optimized, but this does not replace the need for exposure cessation [^25dd41b7] [^80dfa1de].

---

## Evidence-based recommendations

### Immediate removal from exposure

- **Complete avoidance**: The highest-quality evidence and guidelines consistently recommend complete avoidance of the causative agent as the most effective strategy to prevent progression and improve prognosis [^6dd418a5] [^c8897456].

- **Isocyanate-specific risk**: Isocyanates are particularly hazardous; continued exposure can lead to severe, persistent asthma and even fatal reactions, despite pharmacologic treatment and respiratory protection [^c54c6836] [^80dfa1de].

- **Respiratory protection insufficient**: Personal protective equipment (PPE) is not recommended as a long-term solution for managing occupational asthma, especially in the setting of isocyanate exposure, due to the risk of severe reactions and lack of sustained efficacy [^c54c6836] [^80dfa1de].

---

### Specialist referral

Referral to an **occupational asthma specialist** is essential for comprehensive evaluation, management, and coordination with occupational health services [^6dd418a5] [^bcd189ef]. Specialist input also addresses the **legal and compensation implications** of occupational asthma, ensuring appropriate documentation and support [^6dd418a5] [^bcd189ef].

---

### Pharmacologic management

Pharmacologic therapy should follow **standard asthma guidelines**, tailored to symptom severity and control, but it does not substitute for exposure avoidance [^25dd41b7] [^80dfa1de]. Regular follow-up is necessary to monitor **symptom control, lung function, and medication needs** after exposure cessation [^b994ee6d].

---

## Prognostic implications

Early removal from exposure is associated with **better clinical outcomes**, including higher rates of symptom resolution and improved lung function, although complete recovery is not guaranteed [^c8897456] [^80dbdaf2]. Persistent exposure increases the risk of **chronic, irreversible asthma** and significant impairment, even after exposure ends [^5df46de3] [^ca2f66c0].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Recommendation** | **Evidence level** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| Immediate removal from isocyanate exposure | High | - Prevents progression <br/> - Improves prognosis <br/> - Reduces risk of severe reactions [^6dd418a5] [^c54c6836] |
| Referral to occupational asthma specialist | High | - Ensures expert management <br/> - Addresses legal/compensation issues [^6dd418a5] [^bcd189ef] |
| Optimize pharmacologic therapy | High | Controls symptoms but does not replace exposure avoidance [^25dd41b7] [^80dfa1de] |
| Regular follow-up and monitoring | Moderate | Tracks disease progression and treatment response [^b994ee6d] |

---

The most appropriate advice is to **remove the patient from isocyanate exposure immediately** and refer to an occupational asthma specialist. Pharmacologic treatment should be optimized, but it does not replace the need for exposure cessation.

Occupational asthma (OA) may account for 25% or more of de novo adult asthma. The nomenclature has now better defined categories of OA caused by sensitizing agents and irritants, the latter best typified by the reactive airways dysfunction syndrome. Selecting the most appropriate diagnostic testing and management is driven by assessing whether a sensitizer is involved, and if so, identifying whether the sensitizing agent is a high-molecular-weight agent such as a protein or a low-molecular-weight reactive chemical such as an isocyanate. Increased understanding of the pathogenesis of OA from reactive chemical sensitizers is leading to development of better diagnostic testing and also an understanding of why testing for sensitization to such agents can be problematic. Risk factors for OA including possible genetic factors are being delineated better. Recently published guidelines for the diagnosis and management of occupational asthma are summarized; these reflect an increasingly robust evidence basis for recommendations. The utility of diagnostic tests for OA is being better defined by evidence, including sputum analysis performed in relation to work exposure with suspected sensitizers. Preventive and management approaches are reviewed. Longitudinal studies of patients with OA continue to show that timely removal from exposure leads to the best prognosis.

Surveillance case definition for WRA Surveillance case definition for WRA include both of the following:

- Healthcare professional's diagnosis consistent with asthma. 1
- An association between symptoms of asthma and work. 2 The primary physiologic manifestation of airways hyperresponsiveness is variable or reversible airflow obstruction. It is commonly demonstrated by significant changes in forced expiratory volume in 1 second or peak expiratory flow rate. Airflow changes can occur:

- Spontaneously
- With treatment
- With a precipitating exposure
- With diagnostic maneuvers such as nonspecific inhalation challenge 2 Patterns of association can vary and include the following:

- Symptoms of asthma that develop or worsen after a worker starts a new job.
- Symptoms after new materials are introduced on a job. A substantial period can elapse between initial exposure and development of symptoms.
- Symptoms that develop within minutes of specific activities or exposures at work.
- Delayed symptoms that occur several hours after exposure.
- Symptoms that occur less frequently or not at all on days away from work and on vacations.
- Symptoms that occur more frequently when the affected worker returns to work.
- Symptoms that are temporally associated with workplace exposure to an agent with irritant properties. Work-related changes in medication requirements can accompany these symptom patterns.

### Assessment and management of occupational asthma [^b72a42a8]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2020). Medium credibility.

Exposures at work can give rise to different phenotypes of "work-related asthma". The focus of this review is on the diagnosis and management of sensitizer-induced occupational asthma (OA) caused by either a high- or low-molecular-weight agent encountered in the workplace. The diagnosis of OA remains a challenge for the clinician because there is no simple test with a sufficiently high level of accuracy. Instead, the diagnostic process combines different procedures in a stepwise manner. These procedures include a detailed clinical history, immunologic testing, measurement of lung function parameters and airway inflammatory markers, as well as various methods that relate changes in these functional and inflammatory indices to workplace exposure. Their diagnostic performances, alone and in combination, are critically reviewed and summarized into evidence-based key messages. A working diagnostic algorithm is proposed that can be adapted to the suspected agent, purpose of diagnosis, and available resources. Current information on the management options of OA is summarized to provide pragmatic guidance to clinicians who have to advise their patients with OA.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^5df46de3]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Occupational asthma — clinical features and management — notes that in the occupational setting, rhinitis often precedes the development of asthma, and once a patient has become sensitized to an occupational allergen, the level of exposure necessary to induce symptoms may be extremely low; resulting exacerbations become increasingly severe, and with continued exposure, persistent symptoms and irreversible airflow limitation may result. Detailed information is available in evidence‑based guidelines about management, and all patients with adult‑onset asthma should be asked about their work history and other exposures (Evidence A). The early identification and elimination of occupational sensitizers and the removal of sensitized patients from any further exposure are important aspects of the management of occupational asthma (Evidence A); attempts to reduce occupational exposure have been successful, especially in industrial settings. Cost‑effective minimization of latex sensitization can be achieved by using non‑powdered low‑allergen gloves instead of powdered latex gloves, and patients with suspected or confirmed occupational asthma should be referred for expert assessment and advice, if this is available, because of the economic and legal implications of the diagnosis (Evidence A).

The prevalence of occupational asthma is rising, possibly due to the introduction of different chemicals and substances in the workplace. Etiologic agents include organic and inorganic compounds that are encountered in a variety of industries. Early diagnosis, adequate management of inflammation, and prevention of further exposure are essential to occupational asthma management. Reducing complications and disability while providing work rehabilitation should be the ultimate goal of the health care provider.

Conclusions

Occupational asthma is an ideal candidate for prevention and these results present clear opportunities for policy action which would be of practical benefit. We contend that these decisions should be based on evidence as to which agents are most commonly encountered in workplaces and which workers are most likely to be exposed to one or more asthmagens (e.g. farmers) which have not previously been available. Our study has provided some of this evidence and further analysis will show whether available controls are being used.

For pulmonary medicine specialists, our study provides an overall picture of which asthmagens are found in which occupations. While the pattern of use of some agents, such as isocyanates and latex, are well understood, our study provides a wider range range of possible causes for physicians to consider in their consultations with patients.

### Occupational asthma [^1879b0fe]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2012). Low credibility.

Occupational asthma is the most common occupational lung disease. Work-aggravated asthma and occupational asthma are two forms of asthma causally related to the workplace, while reactive airways dysfunction syndrome is a separate entity and a subtype of occupational asthma. The diagnosis of occupational asthma is most often made on clinical grounds. The gold standard test, specific inhalation challenge, is rarely used. Low molecular weight isocyanates are the most common compounds that cause occupational asthma. Workers with occupational asthma secondary to low molecular weight agents may not have elevated specific IgE levels. The mechanisms of occupational asthma associated with these compounds are partially described. Not all patients with occupational asthma will improve after removal from the workplace.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for work-related asthma, more specifically with respect to allergen and irritant avoidance, ERS 2012 guidelines recommend to consider offering reduction of exposure to the causal agent as an alternative to complete avoidance, in order to minimize adverse socioeconomic consequences. Insufficient evidence to recommend this option as a first-line therapeutic strategy. Obtain careful medical monitoring to ensure an early identification of asthma worsening when choosing this approach.

### Work-related asthma [^3cf1aa58]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

Summarize developed evidence-based diagnostic and treatment guidelines for work-related asthma (WRA).

Methods

Comprehensive literature reviews conducted with article critiquing and grading. Guidelines developed by a multidisciplinary expert panel and peer-reviewed.

Results

Evidence supports spirometric testing as an essential early test. Serial peak expiratory flow rates measurement is moderately recommended for employees diagnosed with asthma to establish work-relatedness. Bronchial provocation testing is moderately recommended. IgE and skin prick testing for specific high-molecular weight (HMW) antigens are highly recommended. IgG testing for HMW antigens, IgE testing for low-molecular weight antigens, and nitric oxide testing for diagnosis are not recommended. Removal from exposure is associated with the highest probability of improvement, but may not lead to complete recovery.

Conclusion

Quality evidence supports these clinical practice recommendations. The guidelines may be useful to providers who diagnose and/or treat WRA.

### Evidence based guidelines for the prevention, identification, and management of occupational asthma [^645a2026]. Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Occupational asthma is the most frequently reported work related respiratory disease in many countries. This work was commissioned by the British Occupational Health Research Foundation to assist the Health and Safety Executive in achieving its target of reducing the incidence of occupational asthma in Great Britain by 30% by 2010.

Aim

The guidelines aim to improve the prevention, identification, and management of occupational asthma by providing evidence based recommendations on which future practice can be based.

Methods

The literature was searched systematically using Medline and Embase for articles published in all languages up to the end of June 2004. Evidence based statements and recommendations were graded according to the Royal College of General Practitioner's star system and the revised Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network grading system.

Results

A total of 474 original studies were selected for appraisal from over 2500 abstracts. The systematic review produced 52 graded evidence statements and 22 recommendations based on 223 studies.

Discussion

Evidence based guidelines have become benchmarks for practice in healthcare and the process used to prepare them is well established. This evidence review and its recommendations focus on interventions and outcomes to provide a robust approach to the prevention, identification, and management of occupational asthma, based on and using the best available medical evidence. The most important action to prevent cases of occupational asthma is to reduce exposure at source. Thereafter surveillance should be performed for the early identification of symptoms, including occupational rhinitis, with additional functional and immunological tests where appropriate. Effective management of workers suspected to have occupational asthma involves the identification and investigation of symptoms suggestive of asthma immediately they occur. Those workers who are confirmed to have occupational asthma should be advised to avoid further exposure completely and early in the course of their disease to offer the best chance of recovery.

### Management of work-related asthma [^ceaf8e58]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2009). Low credibility.

The physician managing work-related asthma (WRA) assumes many roles. The first is to confirm an accurate diagnosis, recognizing that WRA has multiple phenotypes, including sensitizer-induced occupational asthma (OA) caused by high-molecular-weight (HMW) proteins or low-molecular-weight (LMW) chemicals; irritant-induced asthma; and work-exacerbated asthma. Pharmacotherapy for WRA is identical to nonwork-related asthma and should be guided by current asthma guidelines emphasizing control of both asthma impairment and risk domains. It is well established that the majority of workers diagnosed with OA caused by sensitizers experience persistent asthma after leaving the workplace. However, the long-term risk of persistent unremitting asthma can be prevented in a minority of cases, particularly with OA caused by LMW sensitizers, by establishing an early diagnosis of OA and reducing or eliminating exposure. The physician consultant may advise employers on workplace interventions needed to minimize effectively an affected employee's exposure to a causative agent or condition, and what measures are required to prevent new cases of WRA (ie, primary prevention). Although allergen immunotherapy has a putative role in treating and preventing WRA caused by HMW sensitizers, further study is needed.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^6dd418a5]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Avoidance of occupational or domestic exposures in adult-onset asthma — assessment and management: Occupational exposures to allergens or sensitizers account for a substantial proportion of the incidence of adult-onset asthma, and once sensitized, the exposure level needed to induce symptoms may be extremely low with increasingly severe exacerbations. Attempts to reduce occupational exposure have been successful, especially in industrial settings, and cost-effective minimization of latex sensitization can be achieved by using non-powdered low-allergen gloves instead of powdered latex gloves. Ask all patients with adult-onset asthma about their work history and other exposures to inhaled allergens or irritants, including at home (Evidence D). In management of occupational asthma, identify and eliminate occupational sensitizers as soon as possible, and remove sensitized patients from any further exposure to these agents (Evidence A). Patients with suspected or confirmed occupational asthma should be referred for expert assessment and advice, if available, because of the economic and legal implications of the diagnosis (Evidence A).

### EAACI consensus statement for investigation of work-related asthma in non-specialized centres [^56896494]. Allergy (2012). Low credibility.

Work-related asthma (WRA) is a relevant problem in several countries, is cause of disability and socioeconomic consequences for both the patient and the society and is probably still underdiagnosed. A correct diagnosis is extremely important to reduce or limit the consequences of the disease. This consensus document was prepared by a EAACI Task Force consisting of an expert panel of allergologists, pneumologists and occupational physicians from different European countries. This document is not intended to address in detail the full diagnostic work-up of WRA, nor to be a formal evidence-based guideline. It is written to provide an operative protocol to allergologists and physicians dealing with asthma useful for identifying the subjects suspected of having WRA to address them to in-depth investigations in a specialized centre. No evidence-based system could be used because of the low grade of evidence of published studies in this area, and instead, 'key messages' or 'suggestions' are provided based on consensus of the expert panel members.

### Diagnosis and management of work-related asthma: American College of Chest Physicians consensus statement [^3424588b]. Chest (2008). Low credibility.

Background

A previous American College of Chest Physicians Consensus Statement on asthma in the workplace was published in 1995. The current Consensus Statement updates the previous one based on additional research that has been published since then, including findings relevant to preventive measures and work-exacerbated asthma (WEA).

Methods

A panel of experts, including allergists, pulmonologists, and occupational medicine physicians, was convened to develop this Consensus Document on the diagnosis and management of work-related asthma (WRA), based in part on a systematic review, that was performed by the University of Alberta/Capital Health Evidence-Based Practice and was supplemented by additional published studies to 2007.

Results

The Consensus Document defined WRA to include occupational asthma (ie, asthma induced by sensitizer or irritant work exposures) and WEA (ie, preexisting or concurrent asthma worsened by work factors). The Consensus Document focuses on the diagnosis and management of WRA (including diagnostic tests, and work and compensation issues), as well as preventive measures. WRA should be considered in all individuals with new-onset or worsening asthma, and a careful occupational history should be obtained. Diagnostic tests such as serial peak flow recordings, methacholine challenge tests, immunologic tests, and specific inhalation challenge tests (if available), can increase diagnostic certainty. Since the prognosis is better with early diagnosis and appropriate intervention, effective preventive measures for other workers with exposure should be addressed.

Conclusions

The substantial prevalence of WRA supports consideration of the diagnosis in all who present with new-onset or worsening asthma, followed by appropriate investigations and intervention including consideration of other exposed workers.

### Occupational asthma prevention and management in industry – an example of a global programme [^f68af5f4]. Occupational Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Isocyanates are widely used in the manufacture of polyurethane foams, plastics, coatings and adhesives, and are known to cause occupational asthma in a proportion of exposed workers. Substitution as a prevention strategy is not currently a feasible option. For this reason, health and safety professionals working together in an automotive coatings business created a proactive global programme to address the known potential effects of isocyanates on its workers. The goals of the programme are prevention, early detection and mitigation of effect of key endpoints, especially asthma and to a lesser degree dermatitis, in people who are occupationally exposed, or potentially exposed, to isocyanates and products containing isocyanates. The surveillance programme for isocyanates has several important components, which include assessment of exposure, pre-placement questionnaire and spirometry, training and education of employees, regularly administered periodic questionnaires, medical assessment for abnormal questionnaire responses, process for early reporting and investigation of symptomatic employees and incidents, group data review and management reporting. Although regional differences exist regarding availability of specialized services, we have successfully implemented this programme in parts of North America, Europe and Latin America, and are currently implementing elsewhere. These simple control measures are relatively inexpensive and can be applied in even small business settings. It is recommended that all employers who manufacture, handle or use isocyanate-containing products consider such a strategy.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^66ab9ec1]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Prevention of occupational asthma in adults notes that an estimated 5–20% of new cases of adult-onset asthma can be attributed to occupational exposure, and asthma may be induced or (more commonly) aggravated by exposure to allergens or other sensitizing agents at work, or sometimes from a single, massive exposure; occupational rhinitis may precede asthma by up to a year, and early diagnosis is essential, as persistent exposure is associated with worse outcomes. Asthma acquired in the workplace is frequently missed; an essential screening question is to ask patients whether their symptoms improve when they are away from work (weekends or vacation), and specialist referral is usually necessary, with frequent PEF monitoring at and away from work often used to help confirm the diagnosis. The early identification and elimination of occupational sensitizers and the removal of sensitized patients from any further exposure are important aspects of the management of occupational asthma (Evidence A); attempts to reduce occupational exposure have been successful, especially in industrial settings, and cost-effective minimization of latex sensitization can be achieved by using non-powdered low-allergen gloves instead of powdered latex gloves. Patients with suspected or confirmed occupational asthma should be referred for expert assessment and advice, if this is available, because of the economic and legal implications of the diagnosis (Evidence A).

Occupational asthma (OA) outcomes after exposure cessation versus reduction — systematic reviews and comparative studies indicate that stopping exposure for an average of 31 months yielded recovery rates of 10 to 100% with a pooled estimate of 32% (95% confidence interval [CI] 26–38%), and the pooled prevalence of persisting airway hyperresponsiveness was 73% (95% CI, 66–79%). Seven studies compared outcome of OA in those who left exposure versus those reducing exposure; four studies found a better outcome in those who stopped exposure and three studies showed a similar outcome with reduction, and pooled analyses and an evidence-based review concluded that asthma outcome was better with complete removal. A Cochrane review confirmed benefit from stopping versus continuing exposure but considered data too limited to draw conclusions on reducing exposure. If patients continue in lower-exposure areas, they require careful monitoring at regular intervals and appropriate interventions.

### Diagnosing occupational asthma [^76700473]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2017). Low credibility.

Making an accurate diagnosis of occupational asthma (OA) is, generally, important. The condition has not only significant health consequences for affected workers, but also substantial socio-economic impacts for workers, their employers and wider society. Missing a diagnosis of OA may lead to continued exposure to a causative agent and progressive worsening of disease; conversely, diagnosing OA when it is not present may lead to inappropriate removal from exposure and unnecessary financial and social consequences. While the most accurate investigation is specific inhalation challenge in an experienced centre, this is a scarce resource, and in many cases, reliance is on other tests. This review provides a technical dossier of the diagnostic value of the available methods which include an appropriate clinical history, the use of specific immunology and measurement of inflammatory markers, and various methods of relating functional changes in airway calibre to periods at work. It is recommended that these approaches are used iteratively and in judicious combination, in cognizance of the individual patient's circumstances and requirements. Based on available evidence, a working diagnostic algorithm is proposed that can be adapted to the suspected agent, purpose of diagnosis and available resources. For better or worse, many of the techniques - and their interpretation - are available only in specialized centres and where there is room for doubt, referral to such a centre is probably wise. Accordingly, the implementation or development of such specialized centres with appropriate equipment and expertise should greatly improve the diagnostic evaluation of work-related asthma.

### Isocyanate exposure and asthma in the UK vehicle repair industry [^683fab81]. Occupational Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Organic diisocyanates are respiratory and skin sensitizers that have been a longstanding common cause of occupational asthma in the UK. Varnishes, coatings and two-pack spray paints used in body shops, particularly in the motor vehicle repair (MVR) industry, commonly contain the organic aliphatic diisocyanates, 1,6-hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI) and isophorone diisocyanate. All workers exposed to airborne isocyanates should have appropriate health surveillance unless a risk assessment indicates there is little or no risk to their health. The Health & Safety Laboratory (HSL) in the UK has developed a method to measure urinary levels of hexamethylenediamine (HDA), a metabolite of HDI, for monitoring workers' exposure to isocyanates and was the sole UK commercial provider of urinary HDA (UHDA) monitoring from 1996 to 2011. The current guidance value for UHDA, derived from the 90th percentile of biological monitoring data from workplaces with exposure to isocyanates, is 1 µmol UHDA/mol creatinine. Exceeding this value should trigger an investigation into the workplace exposure controls.

From 2004 to 2008, the Health & Safety Executive, in collaboration with industry and other stakeholders, ran a national body shop project which aimed to reduce exposure to isocyanates in MVR. Safety and Health Awareness Days (SHADs) provided information about asthma and advice about clearance times before entering the spray painting booth without personal protective equipment. Free UHDA analysis was offered to SHADs attendees. Those employers declining to participate were more likely to be inspected during the lifetime of the project. In addition, new guidance was written in association with, and supported by, the spray booth and paint manufacturers and SHAD material was supplied free of charge to training colleges and trade associations. From October 2007, a topic-based inspection pack was used to guide inspectors visiting MVR premises. All body shops inspected were offered free UHDA analysis. Following the project, UHDA levels were found to be lower in SHADs attendees and in screening samples collected after the project. At the same time, there was a non-significant decline in occupational asthma and short latency respiratory disease in MVR workers relative to other industries reported to the Surveillance of Work-related and Occupational Respiratory Disease (SWORD) scheme, a UK-based occupational respiratory disease surveillance network.

### Occupational asthma caused by exposure to low-molecular-weight chemicals [^b33d94b4]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Chemical agents cause approximately 40% of cases of occupational asthma (OA). Diagnosis of OA caused by chemicals relies on the demonstration of decrements in lung function at the workplace or during a controlled specific inhalation challenge to the suspect chemical agent. Evaluation of workers is accomplished best with a stepwise algorithmic approach and while the worker is symptomatic and still exposed at work. An early diagnosis followed by cessation of exposure can result in asthma remission and is likely to prevent progression to chronic disabling obstructive disease.

### Occupational asthma: review of assessment, treatment, and compensation [^3b27e4ec]. Chest (2011). Low credibility.

Occupational asthma refers to asthma induced by exposure in the working environment to airborne dusts, vapors, or fumes, with or without preexisting asthma. Potential triggers of occupational asthma are diverse and involve a variety of postulated mechanisms. After confirming the presence of asthma, diagnosis hinges on obtaining a detailed and accurate occupational and environmental history and documenting a temporal association of symptoms or signs with workplace exposure. Management of occupational asthma centers on prescribing standard asthma therapies in conjunction with instituting preventive strategies, such as appropriate avoidance of environmental triggers, providing work restrictions, and using environmental controls and/or personal respiratory protection. If a worker is determined to be ill or injured, there are a variety of compensation systems that are designed to protect workers financially from disability related to respiratory impairments; however, the administrative process is frequently difficult to navigate for patients and their providers. Focusing on obtaining a detailed occupational and environmental history, establishing clear objective data to substantiate illness, and estimating or apportioning workplace contribution to the condition is important for the diagnosis and treatment of this relatively common form of asthma.

### Work-related asthma [^85ac7eeb]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Diagnostic evaluation of occupational asthma with continuing exposure — algorithm: If symptoms are present, proceed from "Symptoms consistent with asthma: wheezing, cough, shortness of breath, chest tightness or congestion". If history does not support work relatedness, "Symptoms unlikely WRA/OA. Consider other evaluations of symptoms". If spirometry (FEV1, FVC, FEV1/FVC, pre/post bronchodilator testing) is normal but history is suggestive, confirm asthma with non-specific bronchial provocation (NSBP), with "Positive = PC20 ≤ 4.0mg/ml of methacholine" and testing "during or immediately after work shift", with "Specialist referral recommended for this step". If asthma is established, perform peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) monitoring at and away from work "for a period of 2–4 weeks" and interpret for "decreases in PEFR ≥ 20% compared to measurements obtained away from work". For work-related validation, consider nonspecific bronchial provocation testing (NSBPT) as a second step, performed "within 1 hour after work day" and "after 2 weeks of work exposure, compared to 1–2 weeks away from exposure", noting "Not required to confirm diagnosis". If "patient has asthma and demonstrates sensitization to allergen used in the workplace, diagnosis is established". For irritant-induced OA or work-exacerbated asthma, "Treat asthma, limit irritant exposures". Consider "specific inhalation challenge testing (SICT) – highly specific use"; if SICT is negative, "Consider causes of false negative SICT (wrong agent, wrong concentration, wrong duration of exposure, too long out of exposure)" and "If true negative, consider other airway associated disorders". If clinical history remains compelling despite a negative SICT, pursue "Cessation of exposure for 6 months. Evaluate monthly".

SECTION III: RECOMMENDATIONS FOR INDOOR ALLERGEN MITIGATION IN MANAGEMENT OF ASTHMA

Background

Environmental control is one of the four cornerstones of asthma management in Expert Panel Report 3: Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Asthma. The Expert Panel was tasked with examining the effectiveness of single-component and multicomponent allergen mitigation strategies directed at common, indoor aeroallergens, with the goal of improving asthma outcomes for individuals with asthma. The key questions for this priority topic and the recommendations by the Expert Panel are provided for single-component and multicomponent allergen mitigation strategies.

Not included in the scope of work for this priority topic is an examination of the utility of clinical testing for sensitivity to allergens (eg, using skin prick tests or tests of allergen-specific IgE), mitigation strategies for out door allergens, and mitigation of environmental irritants (eg, tobacco smoke). Specific occupational exposures were also outside the scope of work, although the indoor allergens addressed in these recommendations can be encountered in work settings.

### Isocyanates and work-related asthma: findings from California, Massachusetts, Michigan, and new Jersey, 1993–2008 [^1ef0b436]. American Journal of Industrial Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Isocyanates remain a leading cause of work-related asthma (WRA).

Methods

Two independent data systems were analyzed for the period 1993–2008: (1) State-based WRA case surveillance data on persons with isocyanate-induced WRA from four states, and (2) Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Integrated Management Information System (IMIS) isocyanate air sampling results.

Results

We identified 368 cases of isocyanate-induced WRA from 32 industries and 678 OSHA isocyanate air samples with detectable levels from 31 industries. Seventeen industries were unique to one or the other dataset.

Conclusion

Isocyanate-induced WRA continues to occur in a wide variety of industries. Two data systems uncovered industries with isocyanate exposures and/or illness. Improved control measures and standards, including medical surveillance, are needed. More emphasis is needed on task-specific guidance, spill clean-up procedures, skin and respiratory protection, and targeted medical monitoring to mitigate the hazards of isocyanate use.

### Outcome of occupational asthma after cessation of exposure: a systematic review [^80dbdaf2]. Thorax (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with occupational asthma, and their medical advisers, need valid information about the prognosis of their disease.

Methods

A systematic review of the published literature on the symptomatic and functional outcomes of occupational asthma was carried out after avoidance of exposure to the causative agent. Through a full search of electronic and bibliographic sources, original studies documenting complete recovery from asthma (n = 39,1681 patients) or improvement in non-specific bronchial hyper-responsiveness (NSBHR; n = 28,695 patients) were identified. The median duration of follow-up was 31 (range 6–240) months for studies of symptomatic recovery and 37 (6–240) months for studies of NSBHR. Most studies were of patients recruited from special clinics.

Results

Reported rates of symptomatic recovery varied from 0% to 100%, with a pooled estimate of 32% (95% CI 26% to 38%). These rates were lower with increasing age (p = 0.019) and among clinic based populations (p = 0.053). Patients with the shortest durations of exposure (≤ 76 months) had the highest rate of recovery (36%; 95% CI 25% to 50%), but the effect was not linear. The pooled prevalence of persistent NSBHR at follow-up was 73% (95% CI 66% to 79%). This figure was higher among patients whose disease was due to high-molecular-weight agents (p = 0.006) and, less clearly, those from clinic-based populations (p = 0.561). In between-study comparisons, no clear patterns of improvement relating to total duration of exposure or follow-up were found. From within-study comparisons there was some evidence that a shorter duration of symptoms was associated with a higher rate of symptomatic recovery.

Conclusion

The available data on the prognosis of occupational asthma are insufficiently consistent to allow confident advice to be given to patients with the disease. Clinicians and epidemiologists with an interest in this disease should consider a collaborative and carefully standardised study of the prognosis of occupational asthma.

### Work-related asthma [^020837d2]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Work-related asthma — medical removal considerations by workplace exposure and asthma severity present actions including removal, exposure reduction, and surveillance. For low severity occupational asthma at low or medium exposure, the table states "Remove worker or reduce exposure; frequent surveillance with symptom questionnaire and spirometry. Remove worker if progression of disease". For moderately severe disease at low exposure, it states "Remove worker. Selectively consider low exposure, with monthly surveillance with symptom questionnaire and spirometry. Remove if progression". For high exposure with low severity disease, it states "Removal of worker best option as exposure predicts progression".

### Evolution of occupational asthma: does cessation of exposure really improve prognosis? [^60488f0c]. Respiratory Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Aim

To assess the evolution of occupational asthma (OA) depending on whether the patient avoids or continues with exposure to the offending agent.

Methods

Study in patients diagnosed with OA using a specific inhalation challenge. Patients underwent the following examinations on the same day: clinical interview, physical examination, forced spirometry, methacholine test and determination of total IgE. Clinical improvement, deterioration or no change were defined according to the changes seen on the GINA severity scale at the time of diagnosis.

Results

Of the 73 patients finally included, 55 had totally ended exposure and 18 continued to be exposed at work. Clinical improvement was observed in 47% of those who had terminated exposure and in 22% of those who remained exposed; clinical deterioration was observed in 14% and 17% respectively (p = 0.805). Logistical regression analysis, including the type of agent and the persistence or avoidance of exposure among the variables, did not show any predictive factors of clinical evolution. Similarly, the changes in FEV1 and in bronchial hyperresponsiveness were not associated with the avoidance or continuation of exposure to the causative agent.

Conclusions

Avoiding exposure to the causative agent in patients with OA does not seem to improve prognosis in this disease. Despite these findings, there is insufficient evidence to recommend a change in current management guidelines.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^33b298ba]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Adult-onset and occupational asthma — assessment and prevention: In patients with adult-onset asthma, always ask about occupational or domestic exposures, as these exposures may explain 5–20% of new cases of asthma. In adults and adolescents, the early identification and elimination of occupational sensitizers and the removal of sensitized patients from any further exposure are important aspects of the prevention and management of occupational asthma.

### Features and severity of occupational asthma upon diagnosis: an Italian multicentric case review [^ea145d74]. Allergy (2002). Low credibility.

Background

The severity of occupational asthma (OA) at the time of diagnosis is not known. In this study we aimed to evaluate some features of the disease at the time of diagnosis, particularly looking at severity and treatment before diagnosis.

Methods

Medical records of subjects (n = 197) who had received a diagnosis of OA in six specialized centres of Northern and Central Italy in the period 1992–97 were reviewed. The severity of the disease at the time of diagnosis was determined on the basis of symptoms, peak expiratory flow (PEF, percentage predicted), forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1, percentage predicted), and PEF variability, following the criteria of the National Institutes of Health and World Health Organizaton (NIH/WHO) guidelines on asthma. Medications used in the month before diagnosis were recorded.

Results

The most common etiological agents were isocyanates (41.6%), flours (19.8%), woods (9.7%) and natural rubber latex (7.6%). The level of asthma severity (AS) was mild intermittent in 23.9% patients, mild persistent in 28.9%, moderate in 41.6%, and severe in 5.6%. Asthma severity was positively associated with current or previous smoking (P < 0.05), and was not related to atopy and current exposure. A relationship with bronchial reactivity to methacholine was shown in subjects at work. Treatment before diagnosis was consistent with the NIH/WHO guidelines in only 13.2% patients, whereas 75.6% were undertreated and 11.2% were overtreated.

Conclusions

In this study we found that the majority of patients had mild asthma at the time of diagnosis and that cigarette smoking was associated with a greater severity. Moreover, the majority of patients were undertreated before etiological diagnosis.

### Surveillance for isocyanate asthma: a model based cost effectiveness analysis [^e66e1437]. Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Aims

Because logistical and financial obstacles impede using large prospective cohort studies, surveillance decisions in occupational settings must often be made without evidence of relative benefits and costs. Using the example of isocyanate induced asthma, the most commonly reported immune mediated occupational asthma, the authors developed a model based approach to evaluate the costs and benefits of surveillance from both an employer and a societal perspective.

Methods

The authors used a mathematical simulation model of isocyanate asthma to compare annual surveillance to passive case finding. Outcome measures included symptom free days (SFD), quality adjusted life years (QALY), direct costs, productivity losses, and incremental cost effectiveness ratio (CER), measured from the employer and the societal perspectives. Input data were obtained from a variety of published sources.

Results

For 100,000 exposed workers, surveillance resulted in 683 fewer cases of disability over 10 years. Surveillance conferred benefits at an incremental cost of 24,000 dollars/QALY (employer perspective; 13.33 dollars/SFD) and was cost saving from the societal perspective. Results were sensitive to assumptions about sensitisation rate, removal rates, and time to diagnosis, but not to assumptions about therapy costs and disability rates.

Conclusions

Baseline results placed the CER for surveillance for isocyanate asthma within the acceptable range. Costs from the societal and employer perspective differed substantially with a more attractive CER from the societal perspective, suggesting opportunities for employer/societal cost sharing. The analysis demonstrates the value of a model based approach to evaluate the cost effectiveness of surveillance programmes for isocyanate asthma, and to inform shared decision making among clinicians, patients, employers, and society. Such a modeling approach may be applicable to surveillance programmes for other work related conditions.

### Skin exposure and asthma: is there a connection? [^4de1ef8f]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2010). Low credibility.

Numerous occupational and environmental exposures that increase asthma risk have been identified. Research and prevention have focused primarily on the respiratory tract. However, recent studies suggest that the skin may also be an important route of exposure and site of sensitization that contributes to asthma development. Factors that impair skin barrier function, such as filaggrin gene mutations or skin trauma, may facilitate allergen entry and promote Th2-like sensitization and subsequent asthma. Animal studies demonstrate that skin exposure to chemical and protein allergens is highly effective at inducing sensitization, with subsequent inhalation challenge eliciting asthmatic responses. A similar role for human skin exposure to certain sensitizing agents, such as isocyanates, is likely. Skin exposure methodologies are being developed to incorporate skin exposure assessment into epidemiology studies investigating asthma risk factors.

### Screening tools for work-related asthma and their diagnostic accuracy: a systematic review [^3eef7270]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Asthma is characterised by variable airflow obstruction resulting from airway hyper-responsiveness and inflammation in response to causative antigens. Work-related asthma (WRA) includes occupational asthma (OA) and work-exacerbated asthma (WEA). OA is new-onset asthma caused by inhalational exposure to specific antigens at work, which act predominantly as sensitisers and occasionally as irritants to the airways. WEA refers to the worsening of pre-existing asthma predominantly from inhaled irritants and non-specific factors in the workplace.

Approximately one in six cases of new asthma in working-age adults are occupationally caused, and around one-third of adults with asthma in the UK reported work-exacerbated asthma. In general, the prognosis of WRA is good provided that cases are recognised early and workers are removed from exposure. Conversely, continuation of exposure results in worsening asthma symptoms, deterioration of lung function, need for more extensive treatment, as well as lower work productivity and income loss.

Unfortunately, however, WRA is underdiagnosed, particularly in primary care, and referral and treatment are often delayed; estimated around 4 years from symptom onset to diagnosis. It is currently recommended that information about occupation and asthma should be recorded for adult patients with new-onset or reaggravated asthma symptomsso those at risk of WRA can be referred to a specialist centre for diagnosis. Although several screening tools and tests are available, these are not standardised and not all are validated. Also, recent recommendations and guidelines on occupational asthma screeningare based on the evidence review since 2010and following that, there have been more studies on the screening tools. This systematic review therefore seeks to summarise the range and accuracy of available screening tools for WRA in clinical settings and workplaces, and describe their sensitivity and specificity.

The National Asthma Education and Prevention Program Coordinating Committee Expert Panel Report 4 Working Group has issued a selected update to the 2007 National Asthma Education and Prevention Program guidelines based on predetermined questions. This rostrum provides an overview of the clinically important recommendations and a guide to practical issues that clinicians may face as they implement the working group's updated guidance. It also draws attention to areas in which the recommendations differ from those of the Global INitiative for Asthma. Factors that clinicians may wish to consider as they step up therapy in the continuum of care are elaborated, especially in areas in which the update does not provide sufficient information to make a recommendation.

### Polyisocyanates in occupational environments: a critical review of exposure limits and metrics [^09418384]. American Journal of Industrial Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Determination of polyisocyanates is important because they are a major contributor of exposure to the isocyanate functional group in many workplace environments and are capable of inducing sensitization and asthma. However, with multiple different measurement metrics in use, comparison of isocyanate exposure data between studies and development of occupational exposure limits (OELs) for polyisocyanates is difficult.

Methods

An analysis of existing problems in the measurement and regulation of isocyanates is presented based on the published analytical, toxicological, and regulatory literature, and the authors' own analytical data and experience with isocyanates.

Results

This analysis supports a need for standardization of isocyanate measurement metrics and provides a framework for the development of an OEL for polyisocyanates.

Conclusions

The total isocyanate group (microg NCO/m(3)) is recommended as the most feasible and practical metric (unit) by which to express polyisocyanate exposures for research, control, and regulatory purposes. The establishment of a comprehensive isocyanate OEL that simplifies the current agent-by-agent approach and expands coverage to polyisocyanates is also recommended.

Specific immunological testing — evaluation distinguished high molecular weight (HMW) from low molecular weight antigens; there were six high and 12 moderate-quality studies informing recommendations. IgE testing for HMW antigens is strongly recommended (evidence level A) when validated, commercially available reagents exist. Testing of IgG for HMW antigens is not recommended (evidence level C) for diagnostic use but may serve as an exposure marker. IgE testing to low molecular weight antigens is not recommended (evidence level D).

### Occupational asthma: diagnostic challenges and management dilemmas [^f635ae62]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Work-related asthma encompasses both sensitizer-induced and irritant-induced occupational asthma as well as work-exacerbated asthma. This review summarizes current diagnostic and management strategies for occupational asthma.

Recent Findings

Occupational asthma is the most common occupational lung disease in the industrialized world. Over 400 agents have been described to cause occupational asthma. Specific inhalation challenge is often considered the reference method for diagnosis of occupational asthma but specific inhalation challenge as well as other diagnostic tests all generate false positive or false negative results. Definitive avoidance of the inciting agent is the preferred strategy for sensitizer-induced occupational asthma and reduction of exposure is the next best step. Immunotherapy is not currently well established and can cause systemic reactions.

Summary

An accurate diagnosis made in a timely fashion can positively impact the health and socioeconomic burden associated with occupational asthma. Newer diagnostic tools are promising, but much work needs to be done to standardize and validate these testing methods. Primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention strategies are crucial for effective management of sensitizer-induced occupational asthma.

### Impairment in workers with isocyanate-induced occupational asthma and removed from exposure in the province of Québec between 1985 and 2002 [^ca2f66c0]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective of this project was to assess both the outcome for patients diagnosed with proven isocyanate-induced occupational asthma (IIOA) by specific inhalation challenge (SIC) and the functional impairment, 2 years after cessation of exposure to isocyanates, using the compensation insurance scale proposed in the province of Quebec.

Methods

We used a retrospective cohort of 233 patients diagnosed in the province of Quebec between 1985 and 2002 and randomly chose 105 of those patients. We kept 89 subjects with complete data at T0 (the time of diagnosis) and 79 were reevaluated at T2, approximately 2 years after their removal from exposure, for final impairment-disability assessment. At each evaluation (T0 and T2), a clinical examination and lung function tests, including spirometry and methacholine challenge, were performed.

Results

At T2, 79 of 89 patients were reassessed (89%). The remaining patients were lost to follow up (8) or too unstable to be reassessed for final impairment-disability settlement (2). No statistical difference was observed for spirometry data and antiasthmatic medication use between T0 and T2 (P = 0.11). At T2, 73% of patients were still using short-acting beta2 agonists and 39% inhaled glucocorticoids. A forced expiratory volume in 1 second variation of ± 10% from T0 to T2 occurred in 31 subjects (40%). Forced expiratory volume in 1 second worsened in 14 (18%), remained significantly unchanged in 51 (64%), and improved in 14 (18%). Nonspecific bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) improved in significantly in 19 (24%); the others remained unchanged. Both were not associated with smoking status (P > 0.05). Nonspecific BHR was normalized in nine of 79 (11%) patients. Clinical remission occurred in only four (5%) subjects. The mean impairment-disability score was 21% ± 13% at 2 years according to the scale used by the Workers' Compensation Board.

Conclusions

These results show the generally poor medical outcome of IIOA and suggest the importance of early detection and withdrawal of the workers from exposure to isocyanates. They also emphasize the need for medical surveillance program and adequate treatment of patients with IIOA.

Chemical hazards in hospitals — scope of exposures and effects: Health care workers "may be exposed to a wide variety of potentially toxic chemicals", with exposures occurring "either during unexpected incidents or during normal working conditions", and effects ranging "from minor skin irritation to chronic disease (e.g., occupational asthma), adverse reproductive outcomes or possible mutagenic effects". Exposures "may trigger acute attacks of asthma either in workers who were previously sensitized or through their irritating properties". The occupational health service (OHS) "should have access to clinical toxicology, appropriate industrial hygiene monitoring, environmental control methodology, and recommended and/or regulatory exposure levels".

### Breaking new ground: challenging existing asthma guidelines [^59fc91e2]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Overview of current guidelines

The systematic establishment of a thorough evidence base is currently considered the most rigorous and accurate means to develop clinical practice guidelines. Developing evidence-based consensus guidelines is an enormous undertaking in a field such as asthma, involving a major literature search, consideration of thousands of papers, and time commitment by numerous individuals in the respiratory medical community. Several hierarchies of evidence and grading recommendations have been used by different working groups; those used by the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network are presented in Table 1. The Grades of Recommendation Assessment, Development and Evaluation Working Group has recently proposed a system for grading quality of evidence and strength of recommendations that can be applied across a wide range of interventions and contexts.

The Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) was first launched in 1993 as a program to reduce asthma prevalence, morbidity, and mortality in collaboration with the World Health Organization and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute of the National Institutes of Health in the United States. GINA has published evidence-based asthma guidelines since 2002; annual updates are available on the GINA website. These guidelines emphasize the fact that asthma is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways and that, while asthma exacerbations are episodic, airway inflammation is chronically present. Exposure to allergens is listed as a common risk factor. The fact that medication must be taken every day by most patients to control symptoms, to improve lung function, and to prevent attacks is noted. Criteria defining the control of asthma are presented in the guidelines (Table 2). Moreover, the guidelines provide criteria for determining asthma severity; and recommendations for pharmacological management of asthma are outlined according to a stepwise approach based on asthma severity.

### Asthma caused by occupational exposures is common-a systematic analysis of estimates of the population-attributable fraction [^93542d6e]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

We have not weighted our estimates taking into account the size of the study populations reported. We have, however, provided the number of asthma cases in each study type (Table 5); these data indicate that the longitudinal general population studies have accounted for a major part (more than nine in ten) of the asthma cases upon which the PAR estimates have been based.

There are remarkably few studies, only five, presenting separate estimates for males and females. The median estimates with regard to gender were quite similar, but there is clearly a need for more studies that stratify by gender as well as other potential covariates that may be of interest, such as smoking and atopy. We have taken a simplistic approach regarding exposure classification consistent with a PAR approach. Thus we have not analysed the impact of more specific exposures such as flour dust or diisocyanates, nor have synthesized data from industry or occupation-specific studies that may be relevant to exposure-specific risk estimates.

There have been other recent reports that were not included in our analysis that may be relevant to broader questions of occupational factors in asthma across working groups. For example, a population-based case-control study from Finland provides insights on various occupational groups associated with increased asthma risk, but does not allow for combined risk estimates from which a PAR estimate can be derived. There have also been a number of studies addressing the relative frequency work-aggravated asthma, a subject beyond the scope of this systematic review.

The analysis presented here yields an estimate of the PAR for asthma associated with work-related exposures that is quite consistent with past estimates. The range of the single estimates from each study is quite wide, but we consider a value of at least 15% and potentially as high as 20% to be the most accurate range of the likely population burden of asthma attributable to occupational exposures.

One key lesson clinicians should take from these data is that, when assessing patients of working age who have asthma, the occupational history should be carefully considered, in particular job duties held when the asthma first became manifest. In the same vein, the public health perspective should take into account the preventive implications of such findings. These data underscore the need for further actions to reduce the occupational exposure likely to lead to work-related asthma, on both the individual and population level.

### An official American Thoracic Society statement: work-exacerbated asthma [^ab948dc4]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Rationale

Occupational exposures can contribute to the exacerbation as well as the onset of asthma. However, work-exacerbated asthma (WEA) has received less attention than occupational asthma (OA) that is caused by work.

Objectives

The purpose of this Statement is to summarize current knowledge about the descriptive epidemiology, clinical characteristics, and management and treatment of WEA; propose a case definition for WEA; and discuss needs for prevention and research.

Methods

Information about WEA was identified primarily by systematic searches of the medical literature. Statements about prevention and research needs were reached by consensus.

Measurements and Main Results

WEA is defined as the worsening of asthma due to conditions at work. WEA is common, with a median prevalence of 21.5% among adults with asthma. Different types of agents or conditions at work may exacerbate asthma. WEA cases with persistent work-related symptoms can have clinical characteristics (level of severity, medication needs) and adverse socioeconomic outcomes (unemployment, reduction in income) similar to those of OA cases. Compared with adults with asthma unrelated to work, WEA cases report more days with symptoms, seek more medical care, and have a lower quality of life. WEA should be considered in any patient with asthma that is getting worse or who has work-related symptoms. Management of WEA should focus on reducing work exposures and optimizing standard medical management, with a change in jobs only if these measures are not successful.

Conclusions

WEA is a common and underrecognized adverse outcome resulting from conditions at work. Additional research is needed to improve the understanding of the risk factors for, and mechanisms and outcomes of, WEA, and to inform and evaluate preventive interventions.

Work-related COPD burden and prevention — The number of prevalent cases of COPD due to work was 1.6 million in the United States in 2001–2003, and the number of estimated deaths in 1997 was 5,000 to 24,000. Many aspects of research for the future were discussed, including the need for occupational exposure history, not only a smoking history among patients with COPD. Preventive measures should focus on exposure reduction and, where needed, use of respiratory devices with good worker education, and suspicion is needed to detect new occupational causes for airway disease as demonstrated by the example of popcorn worker's lung.

Principles of pharmacological treatment

Licensed indications for asthma inhalers vary between different medicines, different doses and different devices. Not all asthma inhalers are licensed for use in line with the recommendations in this guideline. Seeorand refer to the summary of product characteristics for individual products.

Take into account and try to address the possible reasons forbefore starting or adjusting medicines for asthma in adults, young people and children. These may include:

alternative diagnoses or comorbidities
suboptimal adherence (see the)
suboptimal inhaler technique
smoking (active or passive), including vaping using e-cigarettes
occupational exposures (see the).
psychosocial factors (for example, anxiety and depression, relationships and social networks)
seasonal factors
environmental factors (for example, air pollution, indoor mould exposure). [NICE 2017, BTS/SIGN 2019, amended BTS/NICE/SIGN 2024]

If possible, check the fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) level when asthma is uncontrolled. If it is raised this may indicate poor adherence to treatment or the need for an increased dose of inhaled corticosteroid (ICS). [BTS/NICE/SIGN 2024]

Do not prescribe short-acting beta 2 agonists to people of any age with asthma without a concomitant prescription of an ICS. [BTS/NICE/SIGN 2024]

After starting or adjusting medicines for asthma, review the response to treatment in 8 to 12 weeks (see the). [NICE 2017, amended BTS/NICE/SIGN 2024]
