## Question

how hypernatremia occurs in vomiting

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how hypernatremia occurs in vomiting. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the definition of hypernatremia and its fundamental pathophysiology. Then, I should verify the composition of gastrointestinal fluid losses in vomiting and whether they are hypotonic. Next, I will examine how vomiting leads to a net free water deficit and impaired water intake. After that, I should consider the role of the thirst mechanism and why some patients cannot compensate. Finally, I will integrate these elements into a coherent causal pathway and briefly note clinical implications and exceptions, making sure I double-check any assumptions along the way.

> Let me first confirm the definition and core mechanism of hypernatremia. Hypernatremia is a serum sodium concentration greater than 145 mmol/L and, in most cases, reflects a deficit of total body water relative to total body sodium, rather than a primary sodium excess, which means the key problem is water loss or inadequate water intake rather than salt loading per se.

> Now, I need to check the composition of fluid lost with vomiting. Wait, let me verify the typical electrolyte content of gastrointestinal secretions. Average stool sodium is about 40 mEq/L, and stool potassium is about 90 mEq/L, indicating that gastrointestinal losses are relatively hypotonic compared with plasma, which has sodium around 140 mEq/L; this means vomiting removes water in excess of sodium, creating a net free water deficit if not replaced [^114bdZnp]. Hold on, I should verify that this applies to emesis as well; yes, emesis fluid is generally isotonic to mildly hypotonic relative to plasma, so the net effect is still a disproportionate loss of water relative to sodium, establishing a free water deficit [^114bdZnp].

> Next, I should review how vomiting translates into a free water deficit. Let me think about the balance: when a patient vomits repeatedly, they lose hypotonic fluid, so total body water declines more than total body sodium, which raises the serum sodium concentration. This is precisely the mechanism of hypernatremia from extrarenal free water loss described in pediatric gastroenteritis and other vomiting-associated states, where free water loss exceeds solute loss, producing hypernatremic dehydration [^1149UR1J] [^113Xv7Rm].

> I will now examine impaired water intake, because I need to ensure I'm not overlooking the second necessary component. Vomiting commonly suppresses thirst and oral intake due to nausea, and in infants, older adults, or those with impaired consciousness, access to water may be limited; since thirst is the primary defense against hypernatremia, inadequate intake compounds the free water deficit and accelerates the rise in serum sodium [^115wJxPT] [^1149UR1J].

> But wait, what if the patient can drink freely and replace the water? Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. Even with intact thirst, if vomiting is frequent and water intake is reduced or delayed, the cumulative negative free water balance can still outpace replacement, especially in children and other vulnerable populations; this is why hypernatremia is a recognized complication of viral gastroenteritis with vomiting and why vigilance for inadequate intake is essential during ongoing emesis [^1149UR1J].

> Let me integrate this into a coherent causal pathway. Repeated vomiting causes hypotonic fluid loss, creating a net free water deficit; concurrently, nausea and reduced oral intake blunt replacement of water; the resulting imbalance increases the ratio of total body sodium to total body water, thereby raising serum sodium and producing hypernatremia; this sequence is most likely when vomiting is persistent and access to water is limited or thirst is impaired [^1149UR1J].

> I should double-check clinical implications briefly to ensure completeness. Hypernatremia from vomiting is a form of hypernatremic dehydration with risk of neurologic complications from cellular dehydration; management requires careful correction of the free water deficit and attention to ongoing losses, with pediatric guidance emphasizing staged rehydration and controlled correction rates to mitigate cerebral risks, which underscores the importance of recognizing this pathophysiology early [^117RVSVk].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost implied that vomiting alone inevitably causes hypernatremia. I should clarify exceptions. If vomiting is mild and the patient promptly replaces water, serum sodium may remain normal. Conversely, if vomiting coexists with salt loading or iatrogenic hypertonic exposures, hypernatremia can be amplified, but the primary mechanism in isolated vomiting remains net free water loss with inadequate replacement, not primary sodium excess [^1149UR1J] [^113Xv7Rm].

---

Hypernatremia in vomiting is driven by **hypotonic fluid loss** (water > sodium) from emesis, which increases serum sodium if water is not replaced [^1149UR1J] [^114bdZnp]. Nausea and vomiting reduce oral intake and thirst, worsening the water deficit. The resulting **hypertonicity causes cellular dehydration** and can lead to neurologic complications if uncorrected [^114ECyLK] [^113Fgqvj]. Management requires careful replacement of free water and close monitoring to avoid rapid correction and cerebral edema [^114xRHnt] [^113Fgqvj].

---

## Pathophysiology of hypernatremia in vomiting

Hypernatremia reflects a **net water deficit relative to sodium**, not sodium excess [^1132Bxdy]. Vomiting causes hypotonic fluid loss (water > sodium), so if water is not replaced, serum sodium rises [^1149UR1J] [^114bdZnp].

---

### Fluid composition of vomitus

Vomitus is **hypotonic relative to plasma**, with lower sodium and higher potassium than plasma, so repeated emesis causes disproportionate water loss and raises serum sodium [^114bdZnp].

---

### Mechanisms leading to hypernatremia in vomiting

Several mechanisms contribute to **hypernatremia in vomiting**:

| **Mechanism** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Hypotonic fluid loss | Vomiting causes water loss > sodium, increasing serum sodium if not replaced [^1149UR1J] [^114bdZnp] |
| Reduced oral intake | Nausea/vomiting suppress thirst and intake, worsening water deficit [^113sAYkf] |
| Impaired thirst mechanism | Elderly, infants, and some chronic illnesses have impaired thirst, limiting compensation [^113Fgqvj] [^115wJxPT] |
| Increased insensible losses | Fever or increased respiratory rate adds water loss, aggravating hypernatremia [^116NNKiw] |

---

## Clinical implications and complications

Hypernatremia from vomiting can cause **significant morbidity**, especially in vulnerable populations (infants, elderly, chronic illness) [^113Fgqvj] [^1137Padb]. Complications include:

- **Neurologic symptoms**: Irritability, lethargy, seizures, coma from cellular dehydration [^114ECyLK] [^113Fgqvj].
- **Renal effects**: Prerenal azotemia and acute kidney injury from hypovolemia [^113cZFkC].
- **Metabolic disturbances**: Metabolic alkalosis from hydrogen ion loss, worsening electrolyte imbalance [^115pGTJD].

---

## Management strategies

Management focuses on correcting the **water deficit** and addressing the cause:

- **Fluid replacement**: Use hypotonic fluids (e.g. D5W or 0.45% saline) to replace free water, with close sodium monitoring [^111WyraN] [^116XhAVB].
- **Correction rate**: Aim for ≤ 0.5 mmol/L/h to avoid cerebral edema; adjust for acuity and symptoms [^113Fgqvj] [^111GVLSX].
- **Treat underlying cause**: Control vomiting with antiemetics and correct metabolic disturbances [^113ts8a4].

---

## Preventive measures

Prevention emphasizes **early recognition and intervention**:

- **Early rehydration**: Prompt oral or IV fluids during vomiting to prevent water deficit [^1164kQq3].
- **Monitoring**: Frequent electrolyte checks in patients with ongoing vomiting or at risk [^112puCGw].
- **Education**: Teach patients and caregivers to recognize dehydration and seek care early [^115GqLaN].

---

Hypernatremia in vomiting results from **hypotonic fluid loss** and reduced intake; **careful water replacement** and monitoring are essential to prevent complications.

### Association between an increase in serum sodium and in-hospital mortality in critically ill patients [^113wkSSX]. Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

A considerable number of patients are admitted to the ICU with dysnatremia, a deranged serum sodium concentration. Furthermore, a substantial number of patients develop dysnatremia during ICU admission.

Hypernatremia ([Na] > 145 mmol/L) is relatively rare at ICU admission but develops in up to 24% of patients during ICU stay and is an independent risk factor for mortality in the ICU. ICU patients are predisposed to developing hypernatremia because of the administration of hypertonic solutions, renal-free water loss due to renal disease, diuretics, and gastrointestinal fluid losses.

Hyponatremia ([Na] < 135 mmol/L) is the most common electrolyte disorder in hospitalized patients. It is a disorder of water excretion and can occur in many different conditions. Severe hyponatremia ([Na] < 125 mmol/L) can result in neurologic symptoms, coma, and death especially if the decrease in plasma sodium develops rapidly. In ICU patients hyponatremia is often mild and is most often already present at ICU admission. Hyponatremia is independently associated with mortality, which may be due to a direct causal relationship. If this association is causal, correction of hyponatremia would decrease mortality. However, we hypothesize that mild hyponatremia could also be an evolutionary adaptive mechanism in critical illness, as it is common in a wide variety of disease states. If so, the higher mortality rate in patients with mild hyponatremia would reflect the severity of the underlying illness, but increase of serum sodium, either intentional or as side effect of other treatments, would not be beneficial and could even paradoxically be harmful and decrease survival.

The objective of this study was to assess the independent association of changes in serum sodium concentration in the first 48 hours of ICU admission with mortality specifically in patients admitted with mild hyponatremia but also for severe hyponatremia, normonatremia, and hypernatremia in a large cohort of ICU patients.

Evidence for oral rehydration solution (ORS) and solution osmolality — The safety and efficacy of ORS, in comparison to intravenous rehydration therapy (IVT), was evaluated in a meta-analysis of 17 RCTs involving 1811 patients aged < 18 years from high-income and low-income countries, with no important clinical differences in failure to hydrate, weight gain at discharge, hyponatremia or hypernatremia, duration of diarrhea, or total fluid intake at 6 or 24 hours between children receiving ORS and IVT; the model estimated that 4% of children treated with ORS would fail and require IVT, and historically standard WHO-ORS (osmolarity 311 mmol/L) was recommended, but in 2002 a hypotonic ORS with total osmolality < 250 mmol/L was recommended by the WHO and other advisory bodies as first-line therapy for mild to moderate dehydration caused by diarrhea of all causes.

### Disorders of water imbalance [^116XhAVB]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

Disorders of water imbalance manifest as hyponatremia and hypernatremia. To diagnose these disorders, emergency physicians must maintain a high index of suspicion, especially in the high-risk patient, because clinical presentations may be nonspecific. With severe water imbalance, inappropriate fluid resuscitation in the emergency department may have devastating neurological consequences. The rate of serum sodium concentration correction should be monitored closely to avoid osmotic demyelination syndrome in hyponatremic patients and cerebral edema in hypernatremic patients.

Key Points

Question

Is the rate of correction associated with mortality in patients with severe hypernatremia?

Findings

In this cohort study of 4265 adults with severe hypernatremia, patient survival was strongly correlated with hypernatremia correction rate. There was no evidence of any neurological complications associated with rapid correction of severe hypernatremia.

Meaning

The results suggest that faster correction rates than currently recommended for severe hypernatremia might translate to better patient outcomes.

### Dextrose and sodium chloride [^1157CMW1]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.3 Hyponatremia

Dextrose and Sodium Chloride Injection is a hypertonic solution [see Description, Table 1 (11)]. In the body, however, glucose containing fluids can become extremely physiologically hypotonic due to rapid glucose metabolization. Monitoring of serum sodium is particularly important for hypotonic fluids.

Depending on the tonicity of the solution, the volume and rate of infusion, and depending on a patient's underlying clinical condition and capability to metabolize glucose, intravenous administration of glucose can cause electrolyte disturbances, most importantly hypo- or hyperosmotic hyponatremia.

The risk for hyponatremia is increased, in pediatric patients, elderly patients, postoperative patients, those with psychogenic polydipsia and in patients treated with medications that increase the risk of hyponatremia (such as certain diuretic, antiepileptic and psychotropic medications) [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

Acute hyponatremia can lead to acute hyponatremic encephalopathy characterized by headache, nausea, seizures, lethargy and vomiting. Patients with brain edema are at particular risk of severe, irreversible and life-threatening brain injury. Patients at increased risk for developing complications of hyponatremia, such as hyponatremic encephalopathy include pediatric patients; women, in particular, premenopausal women; patients with hypoxemia; and in patients with underlying central nervous system disease [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4, 8.5)].

Avoid Dextrose and Sodium Chloride Injection in patients with or at risk for hyponatremia. If use cannot be avoided, monitor serum sodium concentrations.

Rapid correction of hyponatremia is potentially dangerous with risk of serious neurologic complications such as osmotic demyelination syndrome with risk of seizures and cerebral edema. To avoid complications, monitor serum sodium and chloride concentrations, fluid status, acid-base balance, and signs of neurologic complications.

High volume infusion must be used with close monitoring in patients with cardiac or pulmonary failure, and in patients with non-osmotic vasopressin release (including SIADH), due to the risk of hospital-acquired hyponatremia.

5.4 Hypokalemia

Excessive administration of Dextrose and Sodium Chloride Injection may result in significant hypokalemia. Hypokalemic periodic paralysis, metabolic alkalosis, increased gastrointestinal losses (e.g. diarrhea, vomiting), prolonged low potassium diet, or primary hyperaldosteronism may increase the risk of hypokalemia. Avoid the administration of Dextrose and Sodium Chloride Injection in patients with or at risk of hypokalemia or taking medications that may increase the risk. If use cannot be avoided, monitor serum potassium levels.

### Hypernatremic dehydration of infancy… [^1137Padb]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Hypernatremic dehydration is dehydration associated with an elevated serum sodium concentration that is generally defined as a level of 150 mEq/L or higher. Hypernatremia is seen in a variety of clinical states in infancy, but this article is concerned with its occurrence in the clinical setting of diarrheal dehydration in otherwise healthy infants. Such a focus is a practical one, as this is the setting for well over 90% of the cases of HD in infants younger than 2 years of age. Diabetes insipidus, renal disease, mental deficiency, and a number of other conditions may predispose to HD, but although they may help elucidate pathophysiologic findings, they are relatively unimportant contributors to the overall incidence of the disorder. CLINICAL FEATURES The clinical importance of HD stems from its noticeable distinction from nonhypernatremic dehydration as a clinical problem. Almost all clinical reports comment on its relatively high mortality: 785–792.

### Undercorrection of hypernatremia is frequent and associated with mortality [^114bKGNk]. BMC Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

Mean creatinine at admission was 170 ± 108 μmol/L, but no information was available with regard to acute or chronic renal failure. Using the MDRD formula, which is appropriate for chronic renal failure, mean eGFR was 45 ± 26 mL/min/1.73 m²; 94% of patients had an eGFR < 90 mL/min/1.73 m², 69% an eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m², and 34% an eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m² (Figure 1 B).

For 47% of patients, main diagnosis recorded at the ED was a medical disease frequently associated with water loss: infection (pulmonary n = 20, urinary n = 11, other n = 4), gastrointestinal disease (diverticulitis n = 1, diarrhea n = 2, gastroenteritis n = 2) (Table 1).

Surprisingly, hypernatremia was more frequent in winter (39% of cases) than in spring (20%), autumn (21%), and notably summer (20%). In summer, a short peak was observed in July, the hottest month of 2010 in Marseille (Figure 1 C).

Rehydration treatment prescribed at ED is reported in Table 2. Intravenous perfusions was inappropriate for 45% of patients with MBP < 70 mmHg who received a hypotonic solute, and for 22% with MBP ≥ 70 mmHg who received isotonic solute or were not perfused. In 74% of the medical files perfusion speed was missing; in 6% the perfusion setting by the nurse was not reported.

### Plasma exchange successfully treats central pontine myelinolysis after acute hypernatremia from intravenous sodium bicarbonate therapy [^113Xv7Rm]. BMC Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

Hypernatremia is defined as a serum sodium concentration above 145 mEq/L, and it is most often caused by water loss from the gastrointestinal tract due to vomiting or diarrhea, water loss from the skin by sweating, or loss in the urine due to diabetes insipidus, administration of diuretics, recovery from renal failure, or glucosuria. Less commonly, hypernatremia results from the administration of salt in excess of water, such as after intravenous administration of hypertonic saline and salt tablets. In addition, it may occur with the use of certain drugs, such as lithium and valproate, and it has also been shown to occur in patients treated with excess sodium bicarbonate to correct metabolic acidosis. In this case, acute hypernatremia resulted from intravenous sodium bicarbonate therapy for the treatment of severe metabolic acidosis and altered mental status in a patient with symptomatic distal RTA and Sjögren's syndrome.

Osmotic disturbances like rapid correction of hyponatremia can be associated with demyelination of the pons, causing CPM. The disruption of blood brain barrier (BBB) occur secondary to osmotic stress and is thought to be one of the leading factors in pathogenesis of CPM. In fact, in a murine experiment, BBB disruption during the first 24 hours of hyponatremia was associated with a 70% risk of demyelination. CPM can occur in the setting of several osmotic challenges. First, rapid and excessive correction of sodium in hyponatremia, usually an increase in sodium concentration of more than 18 mg/dL in the first 48 hours, can be associated with CPM. Second, in patients with chronic liver disease and alcoholism, CPM can be associated with acute hypernatremia and hyperglycemia after administration of lactulose for the treatment of hepatic encephalopathy. Third, CPM is associated with acute hypernatremia and the rapid correction of hypernatremia. The relationship between acute hypernatremia and CPM is well characterized in animal experiments, showing acute hypernatremia to result in brain myelinolysis and cellular necrosis. Additionally, animal experiments demonstrated that the osmotic gradient necessary to induce brain myelinolysis is higher for normonatremic than for hyponatremic rats. In our case, an overdose of intravenous sodium bicarbonate was associated with not only acute hypernatremia, but also CPM.

6 ADVERSE REACTIONS

The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling:

Hypersensitivity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]
Hypernatremia and Hypokalemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]
Nausea and Vomiting [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]

6.1	Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

SIOPEL 6

The safety of PEDMARK was evaluated in SIOPEL 6 [see Clinical Studies (14)]. Patients received cisplatin-based chemotherapy with or without PEDMARK administered at a dose of 10 g/m², 15 g/m², or 20 g/m²(depending on body weight) as an intravenous infusion over 15 minutes starting 6 hours after completion of each cisplatin infusion. Patients received PEDMARK for a median of 6 cycles (range: 2 to 8 cycles) during a median of 94 days (range: 2.1 to 5.2 months) of cisplatin-based chemotherapy.

Serious adverse reactions occurred in 40% of patients who received PEDMARK in combination with cisplatin-based chemotherapy. Serious adverse reactions in > 5% of patients who received PEDMARK included infection, decreased neutrophil count, and pyrexia.

PEDMARK was permanently discontinued due to an adverse reaction in 1 patient; this patient discontinued PEDMARK for Grade 2 hypersensitivity.

The most common adverse reactions (≥ 25% with difference between arms of > 5% compared to cisplatin alone) were vomiting, nausea, decreased hemoglobin, and hypernatremia.

### North American society for pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology, and nutrition consensus statement on the diagnosis and management of cyclic vomiting syndrome [^117Ucmu1]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2008). Medium credibility.

Cyclic vomiting syndrome — initial screening and alarm features — supported performing screening tests in all children with a cyclic vomiting pattern just before administration of intravenous fluids to include electrolytes (Na+, K+, Cl−, HCO3−), glucose, and upper gastrointestinal radiographs to exclude malrotation; an abdominal ultrasound to rule out transient hydronephrosis, preferably during a crisis, could also be considered in refractory cases. If a patient has hyponatremia or hypoglycemia, then further evaluation should be performed to exclude Addison disease and disorders of fatty acid oxidation. Suspicious symptoms and physical findings include bilious vomiting, abdominal tenderness and/or severe abdominal pain; attacks precipitated by intercurrent illness, fasting, and/or high protein meal; abnormalities on neurological examination including severe alteration of mental status, abnormal eye movements, papilledema, motor asymmetry, and/or gait abnormality (ataxia); and progressively worsening episodes or conversion to a continuous or chronic pattern.

### Potassium chloride, dextrose monohydrate and sodium chloride (potassium chloride in dextrose and sodium chloride) [^1137GadX]. FDA (2019). Medium credibility.

5.4 Hyponatremia

Potassium Chloride in Dextrose and Sodium Chloride Injection is a hypertonic solution [see Description, Table 1 (11)]. In the body, however, glucose containing fluids can become extremely physiologically hypotonic due to rapid glucose metabolization. Monitoring of serum sodium is particularly important for hypotonic fluids.

Depending on the tonicity of the solution, the volume and rate of infusion, and depending on a patient's underlying clinical condition and capability to metabolize glucose, intravenous administration of glucose can cause electrolyte disturbances, most importantly hypo- or hyperosmotic hyponatremia.

The risk for hyponatremia is increased, in pediatric patients, elderly patients, postoperative patients, those with psychogenic polydipsia and in patients treated with medications that increase the risk of hyponatremia (such as certain diuretic, antiepileptic and psychotropic medications). Close clinical monitoring may be warranted.

Acute hyponatremia can lead to acute hyponatremic encephalopathy characterized by headache, nausea, seizures, lethargy and vomiting. Patients with brain edema are at particular risk of severe, irreversible and life-threatening brain injury. Patients at increased risk for developing complications of hyponatremia, such as hyponatremic encephalopathy include pediatric patients; women, in particular, premenopausal women; patients with hypoxemia; and in patients with underlying central nervous system disease [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4, 8.5)].

Avoid solutions with less than 0.9% Sodium Chloride in patients with or at risk for hyponatremia. If use cannot be avoided, monitor serum sodium concentrations.

Rapid correction of hyponatremia is potentially dangerous with risk of serious neurologic complications such as osmotic demyelination syndrome with risk of seizures and cerebral edema. To avoid complications, monitor serum sodium and chloride concentrations, fluid status, acid-base balance, and signs of neurologic complications.

High volume infusion must be used with close monitoring in patients with cardiac or pulmonary failure, and in patients with non-osmotic vasopressin release (including SIADH), due to the risk of hospital-acquired hyponatremia.

### Principles of management of severe hyponatremia [^114bdZnp]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2013). Low credibility.

Problems caused by assuming a closed system

Formulas 2 to 7 do not account for changes in body sodium, potassium, or water other than saline infusion. Under experimental conditions mimicking closed systems, formulas similar to formula 7 predicted accurately the changes in [Na] after the induction of hypernatremia, or hyponatremia. However, patients with dysnatremia do not represent closed systems. They exhibit external losses of solute and water during treatment. The magnitude of these losses, which are usually hypotonic, varies depending on the pathogenetic mechanisms of the dysnatremia, the effects of treatment on these mechanisms, and other conditions present.

Losses occur through the respiratory system, the skin, the gastrointestinal track and the kidneys. Normally, average loss of water though the first 3 routes is ≈1100 mL (≈400 mL through the lungs, ≈500 mL through the skin, and ≈200 mL through the gastrointestinal system), whereas water generation from oxidation amounts to 350 mL per 24 hours. Net water loss amounts to 750 mL per 24 hours or 188 mL per 6 hours. Loss of solute through the 3 routes is proportionally lower than water loss. Sodium concentration in sweat is 30 to 65 mEq/L. In the stool, average sodium concentration is 40 mEq/L, and potassium, 90 mEq/L. Water and solute losses increase in sweating, vomiting, or diarrhea and hyperpnea. Urinary losses vary during treatment of hyponatremia. After correction of uncomplicated hypovolemia, urine flow increases as the volume stimulus for vasopressin secretion disappears and water diuresis ensues. Overcorrection of hyponatremia may follow. –

### Tonicity balance in patients with hypernatremia acquired in the intensive care unit [^116NNKiw]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Hypernatremia is a serious electrolyte disturbance and an independent risk factor for mortality in critically ill patients. In many cases, hypernatremia is an iatrogenic problem that develops in the intensive care unit (ICU).

Study Design

Case series.

Setting & Participants

45 patients were studied in a medical ICU. For inclusion in the study, patients needed to show an increase in serum sodium concentration to greater than 149 mEq/L from an initial concentration of less than 146 mEq/L.

Outcomes

Solute balance, fluid balance, and both. Causes of hypernatremia.

Measurements

The daily mass balance of sodium, potassium, and water over 1- to 3-day intervals was measured while serum sodium levels were increasing.

Results

During the study period, 69 of 981 patients (7%) acquired hypernatremia after admission to the ICU. Of these, 45 had sufficient data for evaluation. Maximum serum sodium levels were 150 to 164 mEq/L. The average duration of hypernatremia was 2 days (range, 1 to 10 days), with an average onset on day 5.9 ± 4.3 of the ICU stay. Patients were classified as having a positive solute balance (n = 17; 38%), negative fluid balance (n = 20; 44%), or both (n = 8; 18%). The most important extrarenal factors contributing to hypernatremia were fever (45%) and diarrhea (18%). Polyuria was observed in 38% of patients and 35% had acute renal failure. Hypertonic solutions were administered to 27% of patients.

Limitations

Retrospective analysis; lack of daily measurement of body weight.

Conclusion

ICU-acquired hypernatremia is associated with multiple factors associated with negative fluid and positive solute balance.

### Acute nausea and vomiting… [^115kkQ1r]. AAFP (2013). Low credibility.

Chronic Nausea and Vomiting ILLUSTRATIVE CASE The patient described previously returns two months later with intermittent nausea and vomiting that is much less severe than on initial presentation. Her current symptoms have lasted two days, and she has had six bouts of emesis. She has no fever, chills, or headache, but has intermittent epigastric discomfort associated with nausea and vomiting. Her symptoms are not relieved by antacids, and she has no melena or blood in her stool. She says she feels full quickly when eating and often feels bloated. She has not had contact with any sick persons or toxins, does not drink alcohol, and appears well hydrated. 38 For this patient, the chronic nature of her symptoms and the waxing and waning course suggest that the most likely cause is diabetes-associated gastroparesis. In this patient and in others with suspected gastroparesis, a gastric emptying study should be performed.

MANAGEMENT A gastric emptying study can detect delayed solid and liquid emptying, which may be present in up to 55% of patients with diabetes. Enhancing glycemic control in these patients can improve symptoms. In addition, a low-fat and low-residue diet that includes small, frequent meals may reduce symptoms of gastroparesis. If possible, medications that delay gastric emptying should be discontinued. 3 However, symptom relief must be balanced against the risk of Parkinson-like symptoms or tardive dyskinesia with the use of metoclopramide and the risk of tachyphylaxis with the use of erythromycin, which limits its long-term effectiveness. Patients with gastroparesis and significant weight loss, recurrent dehydration, or electrolyte disturbances should be referred to a gastroenterologist for possible endoscopic therapies and nutritional supplementation.
40.

Gastritis is suggested by the presence of dyspepsia symptoms, including postprandial fullness, early satiety, epigastric pain, or burning. Helicobacter pylori testing should be performed, 41 and, if negative, a gastric emptying study and esophagogastroduodenoscopy can be conducted, particularly if nausea and vomiting persists. Patients with dyspepsia who are not taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and who have negative H. pylori serology are unlikely to have a gastric ulcer. 42.

### Tonicity balance, and not electrolyte-free water calculations, more accurately guides therapy for acute changes in natremia [^114ayGms]. Intensive Care Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

The usual way to decide why hyponatremia or hypernatremia has developed and to plan goals for its therapy is to analyze events in electrolyte-free water (EFW) terms. We shall demonstrate that an EFW balance does not supply this information. Rather, one must calculate mass balances for water and sodium plus potassium separately (a tonicity balance) to understand the basis for the change in natremia and the proper goals for its therapy. These points are illustrated with a clinical example.

### North American society for pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology, and nutrition consensus statement on the diagnosis and management of cyclic vomiting syndrome [^113ts8a4]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2008). Medium credibility.

Cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) — supportive care and fluids during acute episodes include early intervention and targeted metabolic management. Expert opinion supports the efficacy of early intervention within the first several hours of onset of CVS. Supportive care during acute episodes includes providing a less stimulating environment; replacement of fluids, electrolytes, and energy; use of antiemetics with or without sedation; and provision of analgesia for pain. Some experts recommend higher amounts of intravenous dextrose-containing fluids (D10 0.45 normal saline); the intent of 10% dextrose concentration is to attenuate the incipient metabolic crisis. If late-phase evaluation reveals substantial fluid and/or electrolyte deficits, the task force recommends infusing 0.9% NaCl replacement fluid through a "Y" connecter parallel to the D10. An increased anion gap (> 18–20 mEq/L) may reflect severe dehydration or signal metabolic decompensation and the need for hospital admission. After 2 to 3 days of minimal energy and/or protein intake, illness may be prolonged and can be reversed with nutrition to provide an adequate energy intake and 1.5 g of protein per kilogram per day. In seriously ill patients, administering higher amounts of glucose (eg, 8–12 mg glucose/kg/min) with or without concomitant insulin, close acidosis monitoring, and metabolic consultation are described as critical to management.

Symptoms, Morbidity, and Mortality of Hyponatremia

Acute Severe Hyponatremia

Acute severe hypotonic hyponatremia is a medical emergency. It can lead to cerebral edema, due to osmotic influx of water into the brain, causing raised ICP within the confined skull, and potential cerebral herniation and death (see Fig. 3). "Severe" symptoms indicative of imminent adverse outcomes may include vomiting, seizure, somnolence (GCS score < 8), coma, or cardiorespiratory manifestations of increased ICP (Cushing reflex) such as bradycardia, widened pulse pressure, and irregular breathing. The presence of severe symptoms warrants urgent intervention (see "Emergency Management of Severe Hyponatremia"). Moderately severe symptoms that may precede these include nausea, confusion, and headache. Rapid progression can occur, especially in the case of acute water ingestion when there is water in the stomach that is still to be absorbed, or in the context of inappropriate hypotonic IV fluid administration.

Algorithm for differential diagnosis of hypernatremia, modified according to Bockenhauer et al. and Zieg, J. After excluding pseudohypernatremia, early management is tailored to the volume status and weight of the patient. While free water loss and insufficient water intake are associated with weight loss and low urine sodium, children with salt intoxication gain weight and their urine sodium is high. Measurement of plasma and urine osmolality is important in determining the cause of hypernatremia

Table 2
Etiology of hypernatremia in children

Hypernatremia may lead to neurologic symptoms due to the shift of water from the intracellular compartment, resulting in cellular shrinkage. These symptoms include irritability, fever, and weakness. Severe cases may present with lethargy, focal neurologic deficits, altered mental status, coma, seizures, and death. Children with hypernatremic dehydration should first receive intravenous isotonic solutions to restore intravascular volume and tissue perfusion, followed by solutions containing higher free water content to correct hypernatremia. The free water deficit can be estimated using the formula: 4 mL × weight (kg) × desired change in serum sodium (mmol/L). This formula can be applied for patient management in situations where children are experiencing hypernatremia dehydration and require fluid supplements. It is essential to correct hypernatremia gradually with a recommended correction rate of below 1 mmol/L/h and 15 mmol/24 h to prevent the development of cerebral edema. Some experts recommend administering solutions with slightly higher sodium content (10–15 mmol/L lower) in children with severe hypernatremia (greater than 175 mmol/L) to avoid the risk of rapid decline in serum sodium due to excessive free water intake. Regular monitoring of serum sodium is necessary to avoid a rapid drop in serum sodium levels. Following fluid replacement for losses, hypotonic solutions with lower sodium content (Na 75 mmol/L) are recommended for severe hypernatremia and (Na 30 mmol/L) for mild cases to help control and gradually adjust the sodium concentration. Rehydration strategies are different in children with renal concentration defects to control sodium levels according to specific needs. Individuals with nephrogenic diabetes insipidus should be given hypotonic solutions (dextrose), whereas those with central diabetes insipidus require replacement of water loss with hypotonic fluids alongside desmopressin administration. However, caution is exercised with these treatments as they potentially lead to hyponatremia in cases of renal impairment affecting electrolyte balance. Therefore, careful monitoring of electrolyte levels is essential when administering desmopressin and hypotonic fluids to prevent the development of hyponatremia. In hemodynamically unstable patients, rapid correction of intravascular volume with isotonic saline should be initially used to stabilize the patient. Once stability is achieved, transitioning to hypotonic solutions may be considered.

Sodium imbalances are a common occurrence in the emergency department. Although recognition and diagnosis are relatively straightforward, discovering the cause and management should be approached systematically. The most important history items to ascertain is if the patient has symptoms and how long this imbalance has taken to develop. Treatment rapidity depends on severity of symptoms with the most rapid treatment occurring in only the severely symptomatic. Overcorrection has dire consequences and must be approached in a careful and systematic fashion in order to prevent these devastating consequences.

### Salt and water: a review of hypernatremia [^116t7LQg]. Advances in Kidney Disease and Health (2023). Medium credibility.

Serum sodium disorders are generally a marker of water balance in the body. Thus, hypernatremia is most often caused by an overall deficit of total body water. Other unique circumstances may lead to excess salt, without an impact on the body's total water volume. Hypernatremia is commonly acquired in both the hospital and community. As hypernatremia is associated with increased morbidity and mortality, treatment should be initiated promptly. In this review, we will discuss the pathophysiology and management of the main types of hypernatremia, which can be categorized as either a loss of water or gain of sodium that can be mediated by renal or extrarenal mechanisms.

We sought to investigate the magnitude, clinical features, treatment, and outcome of children suffering from hypernatremic diarrhea and to identify risk factors for fatal outcome among them. We reviewed 2 data sets of children < 15 years admitted to the in-patient ward of the Dhaka Hospital of International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh (icddr, b) with diarrhea and hypernatremia (serum sodium ≥ 150 mmol/L): (a) March 2001 to March 2002 (n = 371) and (b) March 2009 to August 2011 (n = 360). We reviewed their records and collected relevant information for analyses. The prevalence of hypernatremia was 5.1% (371/7212) and 2.4% (360/15 219), case fatality rate was 15% and 19%, respectively. In logistic regression analysis, the risk for death significantly increased in association with serum sodium ≥ 170 mmol/L, nutritional edema, hypoglycemia, respiratory distress, and absent peripheral pulses and reduced with the sole use of oral rehydration salts (ORS) or ORS following intravenous fluid, if indicated (for all, P < .05). Thus, managing children with hypernatremia using only ORS or ORS following intravenous fluid may help reduce the number of deaths.

### Topiramate-induced severe electrolyte abnormalities and hypernatremia leading to central pontine myelinolysis [^114q9DQZ]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Case presentation

A 55-year-old woman with a history of multiple sclerosis (MS), gastric bypass, bipolar disorder and myoclonic jerks treated with topiramate presented to an outside hospital with complaints of generalised weakness. She was found to be markedly hypokalemic at < 1.5 mEq/L. The patient had a history of MS flares with similar presentations, last of which was 1 year prior. However, recent follow-up MRI had not shown any new MS-related demyelinated brain lesions. The patient did not have any vomiting or diarrhoea to explain hypokalemia and had reported that she was recently told to decrease topiramate dose due to side effects, rendering topiramate the likely culprit for her severe hypokalemia despite being on potassium supplementation. In addition to metabolic work up for her weakness, hypokalemic periodic paralysis and MS flare were also on the differential for this presentation.

The patient's potassium was aggressively repleted at the outside hospital both orally and intravenously. She had also received 3 L of intravenous normal saline for hypotension. In review of transfer records, her sodium on day of admission was 137 mEq/L, but rose to 164 mEq/L on day 3 of admission, a change of 27 mEq/L in 72 hours. She was also making around 2.5–3 L of urine per day during this time, thus raising concern for diabetes insipidus (DI) due to a remote history of lithium use for bipolar disorder. The patient never had issues with hypernatremia or polyuria in the past. Her measured urine osmolality was 400 mOsm/kg, see table 1 for details.

Table 1
Laboratory values, intake/output measurements and interventions during hospital course

The patient then developed acute onset encephalopathy and left hemiparesis on day 3. The unilateral upper and lower extremity weakness necessitated ruling out stroke as cause of symptoms and then she was transferred to our hospital for neurological evaluation and higher level of care due to concern for exacerbation of MS versus neurologic vascular event. Neurology did not feel that her presentation was consistent with MS flare or a vascular event. She had an unremarkable lumbar puncture and cerebral imaging.

### Rate of correction and all-cause mortality in patients with severe hypernatremia [^113Fgqvj]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Hypernatremia is a common finding in hospitalized patients, with reported incidence 1% to 3%, and up to 9% in intensive care units (ICUs). Hypernatremia indicates a deficit in total body water, usually occurring in patients with inadequate access to water or impaired thirst mechanisms such as ICU patients, infants, and older adults. The clinical presentation of hypernatremia ranges from mild, nonspecific symptoms such as nausea, headache, and lethargy, to severe neurological symptoms such as seizure and coma. Hypernatremia is associated with higher mortality rates than any other electrolyte abnormality, although this is often attributed to the comorbidities of patients with hypernatremia rather than its direct consequences.

Data regarding the optimal rate of correction of hypernatremia are lacking. Current expert opinion states that hypernatremia correction rate should not exceed 0.5 mmol/L/h or 10 mmol/L/d to avoid the development of cerebral edema and permanent neurological damage. These complications were documented mainly in neonates. Clinical data supporting the safety and clinical benefits of slow correction of hypernatremia in adults are scarce. Several small studies reported that slow correction of hypernatremia is associated with excess mortality. Faster correction rates of up to 1 millimole per liter per hour have been suggested as appropriate for patients with rapidly developing hypernatremia. A recent study found no association between rate of correction of hypernatremia and clinical outcomes. Whether current guidelines reflect the optimal balance between patient safety and potential harm is unknown.

The current study aimed to elucidate the association between the rate of correction of hypernatremia and patient outcomes. We hypothesized that fast correction rates would be associated with more favorable patient outcomes.

### Hypernatremic hydrophobic transient adipsia without organic or severe psychiatric disorder [^116vaD8Z]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Context

Psychogenic adipsic hypernatremia is an exceedingly rare and life-threatening condition, occurring in those with severe psychiatric disorders. Its diagnosis requires exclusion of congenital or acquired hypothalamic pathologic entities. We present the case of a patient who experienced transient severe hypernatremia without evidence of brain pathologic features or known psychiatric disease. In our patient, the transient adipsic hypernatremia had resulted from an episode of mild depression that resolved spontaneously.

Case Description

A 46-year-old healthy woman who had had three recurrent admissions within 1 month had presented for evaluation of intractable nausea and vomiting with a history of a recent episode of a depressive mood change. Each admission had shown substantial hypernatremia (maximum plasma sodium, 166 mEq/L) accompanied by a strong aversion to consuming water. The findings from the diagnostic evaluation showed elevated serum osmolality and lower than expected urine osmolality (urine osmolality range, 474–501 mOsm/kg). This finding, along with an MRI scan showing the presence of a normal posterior pituitary bright spot, suggested that the osmoregulation of her thirst and arginine vasopressin (AVP) secretion were both defective during the attack. The patient was evaluated by psychiatry. Mild depression was diagnosed, and the patient started treatment with mirtazapine, which she only took for a few days. The patient's hypernatremia had completely recovered with resolution of her depression within 2 months.

Conclusion

A mild mood disorder can cause transient dysregulation of the thirst mechanism and AVP secretion through not yet identified mechanisms.

Acute hepatic porphyrias

The most common neurovisceral complaints in acute hepatic porphyrias are abdominal pain, vomiting, constipation, muscle weakness, mental symptoms, head/neck/chest pain, hypertension, tachycardia, convulsions, sensory loss, fever, respiratory paralysis, and diarrhea.

Chronic hepatic porphyria

Patients with chronic hepatic porphyria, such as Porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT), are associated with significant chronic cutaneous photosensitivity but they do not accompany neurological symptoms. Petechiae and purpuric lesions may occur. Skin lichenification, leathery pseudovesicles, and nail changes can be pronounced. Chronic blistering lesions may develop; the fluid-filled vesicles rupture easily and the denuded areas become crusted and heal slowly; secondary infection is common. Previous areas of blisters may appear atrophic, or brownish. Facial hypertrichosis, scarring, and hyperpigmentation can also occur.

Psychiatric symptoms

Psychiatric symptoms in porphyria have led to controversial discussion. In the past, reported psychiatric manifestations have included hysteria, anxiety, depression, phobias, psychosis, organic disorders, agitation, delirium, and altered consciousness ranging from somnolence to coma. Some patients were described with psychosis similar to schizophrenia. Psychiatric manifestations may be divided into two groups. First, an association between chronic porphyria and mild anxiety and depression has been postulated; the nature of this association is yet to be explained. Second, during the active phase of the acute attack, clinically obvious psychiatric symptoms such as psychosis, anxiety, depression, agitation, and delirium are common and may be present in up to 30% of patients. The cause of these manifestations is almost certainly multifactorial and may include common effects of medication used in the management of the acute attack, such as sedation and disorientation arising from the use of opioids, and the effects of metabolic disturbances associated with the attack (e.g. hypernatremia). Acute psychotic manifestations such as paranoia and hallucinations can occur but are very uncommon.

Diagnosis

The diagnosis of an acute attack of porphyria requires the demonstration of increased urinary excretion of the heme precursor, porphobilinogen (PBG). Molecular diagnostic testing is powerful and useful in kindred evaluation and genetic counseling when a disease-causing mutation has been identified in the family. It is also the only proper way to screen asymptomatic gene carriers.

### Undercorrection of hypernatremia is frequent and associated with mortality [^1162HiMf]. BMC Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

Despite the non classical management of hypernatremia, the mortality rate of our cohort (24%) is similar to those previously reported, suggesting that our practices are comparable to those of other EDs (Table 5). In intensive care units, hypernatremia occurrence is a known mortality risk factor but patients are different and hypernatremia is frequently iatrogenic. Indeed, the consequences of cerebral edema differ with age, with a major risk at younger age when the size ratio of brain to cranial volume is high. In our study, hypernatremic patients were old and often had dementia, two conditions associated with cerebral atrophy. Moreover, we show that hypovolemia signs (extracellular dehydration, hypotension, and renal insufficiency) are the principal risk factors for death during hospitalization, suggesting that associated illness and medical status are the major risk factors for death in patients with hypernatremia acquired outside the hospital. This hypothesis is supported by the short delay before death (68% in the first week, most of them during the first 2 days). Three of the 4 patients with a diagnosis of shock at ED died during hospitalization.

In this study, we did not find a statistical link between the level of hypernatremia and mortality. Higher calculated plasmatic tonicity and calculated plasmatic osmolarity were associated with death in the monovariate model (Table 4), but not in the multivariate analysis. The 85 cases analyzed represent a relatively small cohort and there were numerous confounding factors such as loss to follow-up, associated comorbidities, and associated acute illness. The small cohort size also probably explains why the relationship between hypernatremia and death did not reach statistical significance. Moreover, our monocentric study might reflect local practices and a local effect. Nevertheless, in our study, a too slow natremia correction speed was associated with death. This is the first study reporting that under-correction of hypernatremia is associated with an increased mortality. Time spent with intracellular dehydration could be more important than the severity of hypernatremia or hyperosmolarity. In hyponatremia, it is well known that a too high correction speed can lead to osmotic demyelination. In hypernatremia, similar recommendations are given, but physicians should also be aware that a too slow correction rate could increase the risk of death.

### Dysnatremia is a predictor for morbidity and mortality in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 [^1132Bxdy]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This retrospective longitudinal cohort study of 488 inpatients with COVID-19 demonstrated a high prevalence for abnormal sodium of 29.9% at admission and 62.1% at any stage during hospitalization. Admission hyponatremia was common with an incidence of 24.6% and was usually classified as hypovolemic hyponatremia. Hypernatremia and hyponatremia both were risk factors for poor prognosis. Hypernatremia at any time point during hospitalization was a predictor of excess inpatient mortality. All types of hyponatremia were associated with significantly increased risk for needing advanced ventilatory support, with hypovolemic hyponatremia also being a risk factor for in-hospital mortality.

The key novel finding of our study was that hospital-acquired hypernatremia, rather than hypernatremia at admission, was a predictor for in-hospital mortality, with the worst prognosis being reported in patients with the largest increase in serum sodium in the first 5 days of hospitalization. Hypernatremia reflects a deficit of total body water relative to total body sodium and is often accompanied by reduced extracellular fluid volume, highlighting hypovolemia as driver of mortality in COVID-19. The high frequency of volume depletion in COVID-19 illness might be explained by low oral intake due to anorexia or nausea, or significant increases in insensible fluid losses, or, less commonly, fluid losses due to diarrhea. Rehydration and volume repletion are thus often needed in such patients. However, conservative fluid regimens are sometimes applied as a component of lung-protective strategies, leading to the persistence or exacerbation of volume depletion. The contribution of diuretic use to hypernatremia should be limited because they are not routinely used in this context, as volume overload is not a common clinical feature in COVID-19 patients. Until more data are available and in line with the standard clinical approach in patients with other pathologies, an approach to fluid resuscitation that recognizes the frequency and severity of volume depletion, while taking appropriate care to prevent fluid overload or pulmonary edema, should be strongly considered.

Cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) — future directions and conclusions — There are major gaps in understanding of the pathophysiology and natural history of CVS, which limits the development of more effective treatments. Similarly, an incomplete understanding of the clinical features and comorbidities that predict clinical responses is a barrier to developing personalized therapeutic approaches. Clinical research leveraging multicenter, standardized registries of patients with CVS and directed investments by both industry and governmental sources are needed. CVS is a common and disabling condition in adults, but need not be so, as it is a treatable condition, and prompt recognition remains the key factor in avoiding unnecessary investigations and providing patients with effective treatments.

### Oral rehydration versus intravenous therapy for treating dehydration due to gastroenteritis in children: a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^112oe444]. BMC Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Despite treatment recommendations from various organizations, oral rehydration therapy (ORT) continues to be underused, particularly by physicians in high-income countries. We conducted a systematic review of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) to compare ORT and intravenous therapy (IVT) for the treatment of dehydration secondary to acute gastroenteritis in children.

Methods

RCTs were identified through MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, authors and references of included trials, pharmaceutical companies, and relevant organizations. Screening and inclusion were performed independently by two reviewers in order to identify randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing ORT and IVT in children with acute diarrhea and dehydration. Two reviewers independently assessed study quality using the Jadad scale and allocation concealment. Data were extracted by one reviewer and checked by a second. The primary outcome measure was failure of rehydration. We analyzed data using standard meta-analytic techniques.

Results

The quality of the 14 included trials ranged from 0 to 3 (Jadad score); allocation concealment was unclear in all but one study. Using a random effects model, there was no significant difference in treatment failures (risk difference [RD] 3%; 95% confidence intervals [CI]: 0, 6). The Mantel-Haenzsel fixed effects model gave a significant difference between treatment groups (RD 4%; 95% CI: 2, 5) favoring IVT. Based on the four studies that reported deaths, there were six in the IVT groups and two in ORT. There were no significant differences in total fluid intake at six and 24 hours, weight gain, duration of diarrhea, or hypo/hypernatremia. Length of stay was significantly shorter for the ORT group (weighted mean difference [WMD] -1.2 days; 95% CI: -2.4,-0.02). Phlebitis occurred significantly more often with IVT (number needed to treat [NNT] 33; 95% CI: 25,100); paralytic ileus occurred more often with ORT (NNT 33; 95% CI: 20,100). These results may not be generalizable to children with persistent vomiting.

Conclusion

There were no clinically important differences between ORT and IVT in terms of efficacy and safety. For every 25 children (95% CI: 20, 50) treated with ORT, one would fail and require IVT. The results support existing practice guidelines recommending ORT as the first course of treatment in appropriate children with dehydration secondary to gastroenteritis.

### Transient seizure-induced sodium increase camouflaging a symptomatic hyponatremia [^114CGH5U]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

Discussion

Hyponatremia is a disturbance of fluid and electrolytes in which there is a relative excess of body fluid water compared with body sodium content. It is generally defined as a sodium concentration of less than 135 mmol/L and is the most commonly observed electrolyte disturbance in clinical medicine with a reported prevalence of 4% in the adult internal medicine patient population treated in the emergency department and up to 30% in hospitalised patients. Hyponatremia has a variety of etiologies and is most commonly caused by the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (ADH) secretion, the use of thiazide diuretics, congestive heart failure, severe vomiting and diarrhoea or polydipsia. Symptoms are often mild and non-specific like headache, nausea and confusion but can be severe and life-threatening with cardiorespiratory distress, seizures and coma. Severe symptoms are more commonly seen in cases of acute hyponatremia but also chronic hyponatremia in apparently asymptomatic patients must be considered a serious illness as it is associated with an marked increase in the risk of all-cause mortality. Although rare, encephalopathy is the most serious complication of acute hyponatremia. It is the result of cerebral oedema and increased intracranial pressure caused by the osmotically driven movement of water into brain cells after the extracellular compartment has become hypoosmolar in a relative short period of time (< 48 hours). Left untreated hyponatremic encephalopathy could result in neurological deterioration or death.

### Electrolyte disorders related emergencies in children [^1149UR1J]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Hypernatremia

Hypernatremia is characterized by a plasma sodium concentration greater than 145 mmol/L. Hypernatremia is a less common SEA and generally affects children less than 4 years old. This condition typically arises from decreased free water intake or increased loss of solute-free water and viral gastroenteritis is the leading cause. Additionally, a less common cause is salt poisoning. Importantly, hypernatremic dehydration can result from excessive water loss due to conditions including osmotic diuresis or urinary concentration defects. Determining the cause of the hypernatremic state is crucial for effective management and is depicted in Fig. 3. When the FENa is less than 1% and the patient demonstrates weight loss, this can be either attributed to free water loss or insufficient water intake. Free water loss in a hypernatremic state is attributed to extrarenal causes such as vomiting and diarrhea or renal losses such as antidiuretic hormone (ADH) resistance or osmotic diuresis. Furthermore, if a patient demonstrates a FENa of greater than 2% with weight gain, this is typically attributed to salt excess. Additionally, Table 2 demonstrates the various causes of hypernatremia in children.

### Disorders of sodium and water balance [^111nVwLA]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Dysnatremias occur simultaneously with disorders in water balance. The first priority is to correct dehydration; once the patient is euvolemic, the sodium level can be reassessed. In unstable patients with hyponatremia, the clinician should rapidly administer hypertonic saline. In unstable patients with hypernatremia, the clinician should administer isotonic intravenous fluid. In stable patients with either hyponatremia or hypernatremia, the clinician should aim for correction over 24 to 48 hours, with the maximal change in serum sodium between 8 to 12 mEq/L over the first 24 hours. This rate of correction decreases the chances of cerebral edema or osmotic demyelination syndrome.

### Diagnosis and management of sodium disorders: hyponatremia and hypernatremia [^111WyraN]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Hyponatremia and hypernatremia are electrolyte disorders that can be associated with poor outcomes. Hyponatremia is considered mild when the sodium concentration is 130 to 134 mEq per L, moderate when 125 to 129 mEq per L, and severe when less than 125 mEq per L. Mild symptoms include nausea, vomiting, weakness, headache, and mild neurocognitive deficits. Severe symptoms of hyponatremia include delirium, confusion, impaired consciousness, ataxia, seizures, and, rarely, brain herniation and death. Patients with a sodium concentration of less than 125 mEq per L and severe symptoms require emergency infusions with 3% hypertonic saline. Using calculators to guide fluid replacement helps avoid overly rapid correction of sodium concentration, which can cause osmotic demyelination syndrome. Physicians should identify the cause of a patient's hyponatremia, if possible; however, treatment should not be delayed while a diagnosis is pursued. Common causes include certain medications, excessive alcohol consumption, very low-salt diets, and excessive free water intake during exercise. Management to correct sodium concentration is based on whether the patient is hypovolemic, euvolemic, or hypervolemic. Hypovolemic hyponatremia is treated with normal saline infusions. Treating euvolemic hyponatremia includes restricting free water consumption or using salt tablets or intravenous vaptans. Hypervolemic hyponatremia is treated primarily by managing the underlying cause (e.g., heart failure, cirrhosis) and free water restriction. Hypernatremia is less common than hyponatremia. Mild hypernatremia is often caused by dehydration resulting from an impaired thirst mechanism or lack of access to water; however, other causes, such as diabetes insipidus, are possible. Treatment starts with addressing the underlying etiology and correcting the fluid deficit. When sodium is severely elevated, patients are symptomatic, or intravenous fluids are required, hypotonic fluid replacement is necessary.

Side effects

Adverse events after PRRT have been systematically assessed in patients with neuroendocrine tumours. Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) grade 3 and 4 adverse events occur in approximately 40% of patients, but are generally clinically well manageable and most commonly include nausea (4%), vomiting (7%) and lymphopenia (9%). Reported experience in retrospective and small meningioma studies is in line with these findings.

Acute side effects

Adverse effects of PRRT are typically mild, and precautions are taken as needed. Nausea, headache, and occasionally vomiting may occur in the majority of patients due to metabolic acidosis induced by amino acid co-administration. Special attention should be given to prevent potential electrolyte imbalances (such as hyperkalemia and hypernatremia) and subsequent metabolic acidosis, which can result in mild nausea and vomiting. Hydrating the patient with normal saline and possibly repeating antiemetic administrations can help manage these side effects. In the context of meningiomas, patients may experience acute post-treatment epileptic seizures or signs of intracranial hypertension, for which antiepileptic drugs or corticosteroids should be prescribed accordingly.

Regarding radiotracer extravasation leading to potential soft tissue damage little is known. In case of radiotracer extravasation, discontinuation of the radiotracer infusion is recommended. The application of warm compresses to limit extravasation of the radiotracer for 20 min with repetition at 6, 18 and 24 h after injection can be considered. Raising the affected limb and stimulating lymphatic drainage of this small radiopharmaceutical may reduce local accumulation overnight. Notify the person competent in radiation protection for a dosimetry study.

### Clinical practice guideline: maintenance intravenous fluids in children [^112puCGw]. Pediatrics (2018). Medium credibility.

Biochemical laboratory monitoring and dysnatremia risk during maintenance intravenous fluids (IVFs): Researchers in most studies obtained serial plasma sodium values, with the first plasma sodium being measured between 6 hours and 12 hours, and in patients receiving isotonic fluids the incidence of hyponatremia ranged from 0% to 23%. Clinicians should be aware that even patients receiving isotonic maintenance IVFs are at sufficient risk for developing hyponatremia and, if isotonic IVF recipients develop hyponatremia, they should be evaluated to determine if they are receiving other sources of free water or if they may have SIAD and/or an adrenal insufficiency. If hypernatremia develops (plasma sodium > 144 mEq/L), patients should be evaluated for renal dysfunction or extrarenal free-water losses. In patients at high risk for developing electrolyte abnormalities, such as those who have undergone major surgery, those in the ICU, or those with large gastrointestinal losses or receiving diuretics, frequent laboratory monitoring may be necessary, and if neurologic symptoms that could be consistent with hyponatremic encephalopathy are present, such as unexplained nausea, vomiting, headache, confusion, or lethargy, electrolytes should be measured.

Utility of Copeptin Measurement in Hyper- and Hyponatremia

Copeptin Measurement in Hypernatremia

While hypernatremia is a rare finding in outpatients, it is much more common in hospitalized patients showing a prevalence of 2% to 3%. Hypernatremia results from a free water deficit due to renal (central or nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, glycosuria) or extrarenal water loss or from iatrogenic sodium overload (eg, uncontrolled saline infusion, tube feeding). In the majority of hospitalized hypernatremia patients, the electrolyte imbalance is not present at admission, but develops during hospitalization. Besides iatrogenic issues, many other factors and comorbidities such as heart failure, chronic kidney disease, sepsis, neurological impairment with impaired thirst perception, or inability to drink may promote the development of hypernatremia in the acute setting. Hypernatremia is therefore also a marker of disease severity and, unsurprisingly, studies consistently report increased mortality rates in patients with hypernatremia.

The most important measure to correct hypernatremia is to increase the free water supply, such as by intravenous hypotonic infusion. Additionally, in salt-overloaded patients iatrogenic action has to be stopped and diabetes insipidus patients need timely treatment with desmopressin.

The high rate of hospital-acquired hypernatremia underpins insufficient hypernatremia awareness in hospitalized patients, with the result of inadequate treatment and worse outcome. Specifically, for hospitalized patients with diabetes insipidus, a retrospective audit showed that desmopressin treatment was delayed in 88% of patients at admission, putting them at risk of hypernatremia. This prompted the Society for Endocrinology to publish guidelines on in-hospital management of central diabetes insipidus in 2018. For patients with undiagnosed diabetes insipidus who are also at need for early desmopressin treatment, copeptin has been proposed as a readily available diagnostic marker in the acute setting.

### Application of group LASSO regression based Bayesian networks in risk factors exploration and disease prediction for acute kidney injury in hospitalized patients with hematologic malignancies [^112vGYD5]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Apart from the conventional risk factors, our study reveals that electrolyte disturbance was also associated with a higher risk of AKI. Olgar et al. reported that among leukemia patients, hyponatremia and hypernatremia accounted for 11.7 and 9.5%, hypokalemia and hyperkalemia accounted for 7.6 and 6.0%. Volume depletion such as hemorrhage, diarrhea and vomiting is the main cause of hyponatremia, which is not uncommon in HM patients receiving chemotherapy. Nutritional deficiency, and continuous undercapacity of volume can also result in hypokalemia. It was reported that the excessive production of blast cells can also cause hypokalemia in patients with leukemia. Consistent with our study, the HM category is recognized to cast an effect on renal insufficiency. Lymphomatous or leukemic infiltration can lead to enlarged kidneys. Leukemic hyperleukocytosis can alter the renal vascular permeability via microcapillary obstruction and renal vein thrombosis. in the presence of lymphadenopathy and drug-induced crystalluria, such as acyclovir and cotrimoxazole, obstructive nephropathy can occur. Moreover, we found that patients receiving ASCT had a higher risk of AKI. This may be related to the adverse effect of calcineurin inhibitors, graft versus host disease and hepatic sinusoidal obstruction syndrome.

### Intravenous solutions in the care of patients with volume depletion and electrolyte abnormalities [^1134hMUp]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Infusion fluids are often given to restore blood pressure (volume resuscitation), but may also be administered to replace ongoing losses, match insensible losses, correct electrolyte or acid-base disorders, or provide glucose. The development of new infusion fluids has provided clinicians with a wide range of products. Although the choice for a certain infusion fluid is often driven more by habit than by careful consideration, we believe it is useful to approach infusion fluids as drugs and consider their pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics. This approach not only explains why infusion fluids may cause electrolyte and acid-base disturbances, but also why they may compromise kidney function or coagulation. In this teaching case, we present a 19-year-old patient in whom severe hypernatremia developed as a result of normal saline solution infusion and explore the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic effects of frequently used infusion fluids. We review clinical evidence to guide the selection of the optimal infusion fluid.

### Hypernatremia in the intensive care unit [^114HxUGq]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Hypernatremia is a relatively frequent electrolyte disorder seen in critically ill patients. As many as 27% of patients in intensive care units (ICUs) develop hypernatremia of variable severity during an ICU stay. Debate among specialists often ensues as to whether to correct hypernatremia or not. Some practitioners, particularly intensivists, believe that correction of hypernatremia with fluids may cause expansion of the extracellular fluid volume (ECFV) thereby worsening ventilation and impeding extubation. Other practitioners, including many nephrologists, do not expect correction of hypernatremia to lead to clinically apparent ECFV expansion, and fear other deleterious effects of hypernatremia. In this review we address the controversy regarding appropriate practice.

Recent Findings

There are no randomized, clinical trials (RCTs) to guide the administration of electrolyte-free fluid administration in hypernatremic patients. However, there are associations, demonstrated in the literature, suggesting that hypernatremia of any severity will increase the mortality and length of stay in these patients. These associations generally support the practice of correction of hypernatremia. In addition, our knowledge of the distribution of total body water influences us towards correcting hypernatremia as an appropriate therapy. We do not expect that adequate RCTs addressing this question will be performed.

Summary

Allowing persistence of any degree of hypernatremia is associated with increased mortality, length of stay (LOS) and postdischarge mortality. We expect that proper use of electrolyte-free water intake will avoid adverse outcomes.

### Severe hypernatremia in a hospitalized child: munchausen by proxy [^113oXt5n]. Pediatric Neurology (2010). Low credibility.

An 8-week-old infant presented to a referring institution with profuse diarrhea and infectious enteritis for 1 week. He was initially treated for suspected Salmonella spp. sepsis and meningitis, because the organism was found in the stool, but the child's illness progressed, manifested by paroxysmal profuse diarrhea and increased urine output. After several weeks, he suffered a sagittal venous thrombosis and intracranial hemorrhage. Subsequently the child was transferred to a tertiary center for intestinal evaluation. The patient's diarrhea and excessive diuresis resolved, and his sodium normalized soon after transfer. Four days later, however, after his mother arrived, he immediately developed severe hypernatremia (serum sodium concentration [Na(+)] = 214 mEq/L), with resumption of diarrhea and excessive diuresis. A gastric aspirate during the crisis demonstrated an extremely high sodium content, [Na(+)] = 1416 mEq/L, consistent with salt intoxication. Surveillance of the mother revealed that she manipulated the indwelling nasogastric tube; confronted, she admitted to salt administration. This case describes one of the ways that Munchausen syndrome by proxy can manifest with profound neurologic sequelae, and highlights the need for close observation and swift intervention when sufficient cause is present.

### Understanding hypernatremia [^114itjBg]. American Journal of Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

Understanding hypernatremia is at times difficult for many clinicians. However, hypernatremia can often be deciphered easily with some basic understanding of water and sodium balance. Here, the basic pathophysiological abnormalities underlying the development of sodium disorders are reviewed, and case examples are given. Hypernatremia often arises in the hospital, especially in the intensive care units due to the combination of (1) not being able to drink water; (2) inability to concentrate the urine (most often from having kidney failure); (3) osmotic diuresis from having high serum urea concentrations, and (4) large urine or stool outputs.

### Diagnosis and management of disorders of body tonicity-hyponatremia and hypernatremia: core curriculum 2020 [^114RpkPA]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Overall body fluid concentration is regulated within a narrow range by the concerted action of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis to influence water intake through thirst and water excretion via the effect of vasopressin, or antidiuretic hormone, on renal collecting duct water permeability. Sodium is the principal extracellular cation; abnormalities in overall effective body fluid concentration, or tonicity, manifest as disturbances in serum sodium concentration. Depending on its severity and chronicity, hyponatremia can lead to significant symptoms, primarily related to central nervous system function. Failure to correct hyponatremia can lead to permanent neurologic damage, as can over rapid correction. It is thus essential to stay within specific limits for correction, particularly for chronic hyponatremia. Hypernatremia also leads to central nervous system dysfunction, although goals for its correction rate are less well established. This Core Curriculum article discusses the normal regulation of tonicity and serum sodium concentration and the diagnosis and management of hypo- and hypernatremia.

An increased infusion rate of Potassium Chloride in Dextrose and Sodium Chloride Injection can cause:

### Dysnatremia and mortality: do sweat the small stuff [^112jU1HZ]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Marked dysnatremia is associated with increased mortality in patients admitted to intensive care. However, new evidence suggests that even mild deviations from normal and simple variability of sodium values may also be significant. Should these findings prompt clinicians to re-evaluate the approach to fluid management in this setting? Sodium disorders, on one hand, are known to result from overzealous administration or restriction of free water or sodium ions. However, they are also associated with a range of co-morbidities and drug treatments that alter water loss and sodium handling in the nephron independently of prescribed fluid regimens. Moreover, powerful neuroendocrine and inflammatory responses to surgery, trauma and other acute illness may induce or intensify such changes, altering the response to administered fluids. These observations suggest that both patient and treatment variables contribute, but the extent to which sodium disturbances are preventable and whether prevention improves outcome are unknown. Dysnatremia certainly reflects underlying systemic disorders, but how important is fluid management as a cause, and does it contribute independently to poorer outcomes through osmotic or other mechanisms? Although total fluid volume and doses of potassium and glucose are regularly adjusted in critically ill patients, sodium is usually delivered at standard concentrations as long as serum values lie within an acceptable range. It may be prudent to pay closer attention to these values, especially when abnormal, when fluctuating or when an adverse trend is present. More frequent measurements of sodium in blood, urine and drainage fluids, and appropriate adjustment of the sodium content of prescribed fluids, may be indicated. Until more light can be shed on the pathophysiology of dysnatremia in the critically ill, we should assume that better control of plasma sodium levels may yield better outcomes.

Acute cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) exacerbation — intravenous (IV) fluids: The guideline panel determined that there is very low certainty evidence (no direct evidence) on whether D10 or D5 containing IV fluids should be used in children with an acute CVS exacerbation, and standard practice for IV rehydration should be implemented, with a focus on the rapidity of intervention. In patients with known or suspected metabolic disorders, higher glucose infusion rates should be considered, and there is no evidence to support specialized IV fluids, which may delay care compared to the use of routine IV fluids. Patient-specific concerns about hypo- or hyper-glycemia can be evaluated with bedside blood glucose monitoring or other standard techniques in the acute care setting. The panel rated the overall certainty as very low and thought there was probably no impact on equity or costs associated with D10 versus D5 IV fluids, noting that either is likely to be acceptable, but D10 is probably not feasible; the panel judged any undesirable effects as trivial and mostly related to practical considerations and potential delay in care with specialized rather than standard IV fluids.

### Postoperative dysnatremia in pediatric patients undergoing palatoplasty [^116sgE3P]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Treatment

Hypernatremia treatment relies on addressing the underlying cause (listed in Supplemental Table 4, Supplemental Digital Content 2,) and correcting the serum sodium level and free water deficit. Treating the etiology may include stopping gastrointestinal or cutaneous losses, controlling fever, hyperglycemia, and glycosuria, withholding diuretics, treating other electrolyte disorders, adapting feeding formula, or in case of diabetes insipidus, replacing vasopressin. Fluid management requires correction of the free water deficit and replacement of the ongoing losses, which can be calculated as follows (desired natremia change in mmol/l). Free water deficit (ml) = 4 ml×lean body weight (kg)×(desired natremia change in mmol/l).

To avoid correction errors and subsequent neurological symptoms, one should aim for a natremia change of 1 mmol/h or 15 mmol/24h. In case of severe hypernatremia (Na > 170 mmol/l), the correction should not go below 150 mmol/l in the first 48 to 72 hours. It is necessary to monitor sodium levels at 1 to 4-hour intervals early in the treatment to ensure a gradual decrease of sodium level. The development of seizures may be a sign of cerebral oedema due to the rapid correction of hypernatremia. Administration of hypertonic saline to slightly increase sodium concentration usually permits to slow the rate of correction and resolves the neurological symptoms.

The treatment of hyponatremia requires analysis of serum osmolality, volume status, and urine osmolality.

Measurement of serum osmolality identifies "true hyponatremia", hypotonic hyponatremia. Euvolemic hyponatremia is a pseudohyponatremia caused by a high concentration of proteins in the plasma, while hypertonic hyponatremia appears in the case of hyperglycemia.

Once hypotonic hyponatremia is confirmed, the extracellular volume status of the patient should be evaluated. Clinical history of fluid imbalance, weight changes, drugs, and underlying medical conditions and clinical examination permit to identify the etiology and type of hyponatremia (see Supplemental Table 3, Supplemental Digital Content 2). In addition, assessing the urinary sodium concentration permits one to distinguish between renal (U[Na] > 20) and nonrenal causes (U[Na] < 20) of hyponatremia. It is the classification of the natremia that defines its treatment (Figure 2).

### AGA clinical practice update on management of medically refractory gastroparesis: expert review [^113hxNJ9]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

Medically refractory gastroparesis — electrolyte derangements are common in patients with persistent nausea and vomiting and should be corrected, and a thyroid stimulating hormone level can be checked if hypothyroidism is a concern. Hyperkalemia and metabolic acidosis may indicate adrenal insufficiency, which can be initially evaluated by measuring a fasting cortisol level. Upper endoscopy should be performed to rule out an organic cause of symptoms. Gastric emptying can be measured by using several techniques (scintigraphy, 13Cspirulina breath test, wireless motility capsule); most U.S. centers perform gastric scintigraphy, albeit often incorrectly with short measurement times, leading to misdiagnosis and mismanagement. Joint American Nuclear Medicine Society and American Neurogastroenterology and Motility Society guidelines outline key protocol requirements for performing an accurate 4-hour test; optimally performed off opioid medication. Repeating scintigraphy may change the pathophysiological and diagnostic categorization from gastroparesis to FD and vice versa in as many as 37%-42% within the course of a year. A careful history, thoughtful physical examination, and prudent diagnostic tests can distinguish conditions that mimic refractory gastroparesis, with important physical examination findings including a succussion splash, a bruit on auscultation of the right upper quadrant, digital ulcers and telangiectasia, and ascites, a mass or enlarged lymph nodes. Because there are no prospective, randomized controlled studies comparing different management strategies (eg, a central anti-emetic vs a prokinetic agent), initiating treatment based on the predominant presenting symptom is a reasonable first approach. Clinicians should familiarize themselves with the black box warning associated with metoclopramide use, although the risk of tardive dyskinesia from chronic metoclopramide use may be lower than previously estimated by regulatory authorities. Because the wireless motility capsule, an inanimate object, identifies the phase III activity front of the migrating motor complex rather than overall gastric emptying, a meal-based test provides better physiological assessment of gastric emptying.

### Effectiveness of three commonly used transition phase diets in the inpatient management of children with severe acute malnutrition: a pilot randomized controlled trial in Malawi [^115e3e43]. BMC Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

We did not find a significant effect of different transition phase diets on hospital stay. However, the presence of HIV infection may increase the duration of hospital stay. HIV infected malnourished children have a varied clinical presentation and the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms are potentially different from children without HIV, although this is hardly studied. Superimposed infections, including diarrhea, tuberculosis and extensive cutaneous infections are common and complicate not only the clinical picture but also the therapeutic response of children with SAM.

Disturbances in electrolytes are common in children suffering from severe acute malnutrition. Electrolyte disturbances can occur as a result of diarrhea, vomiting and/or dehydration. Clinically relevant hyponatremia was present in 6.8% of the admitted children with SAM in our study. The prevalence of hypernatremia at admission was 10,8%, which was lower than the previously reported 15.7% with the same cut- off value. Before transitioning (T 0), hyponatremia was present in 6.9% of the patients and hypernatremia in 8.3% of the patients. Interestingly, 3 days after transition (T 3) the percentage of patients with hyponatremia and hypernatremia was 12.9% in both groups. This coincided with an increase in diarrhea. The lack of improvement in these clinical and biochemical parameters over time suggests an on-going enteropathy, perhaps in part related to persistence of intestinal infections. This could also be related to diet-induced osmotic diarrhea due to general malnutrition-related impairment in intestinal function. Finally, all children receive antibiotic treatment which could be involved in the on-going diarrhea. Total mortality after initial stabilization was still substantial in our study (8%). This is in line with previously reported case series. We did not find difference in mortality between our interventions but our study was not powered to detect differences in mortality rates.

Regarding age, in our study, patients who developed hospital-acquired hypernatremia were older compared with patients with normonatremia. However, age was less important in the multivariable model after accounting for CKD status. It is well known that hypernatremia mostly results from net water loss reflecting pure water or hypotonic fluid loss, while thirst provides the ultimate defense against developing hypernatremia assuming the ability to access water. Therefore, hypernatremia in adults largely occurs in older patients with infirmity, cognitive deficits, or altered mental status who depend on others for their water requirements. Thirst is also suppressed in older patients. However, hypernatremia can result from hypertonic sodium gainduring hospitalization as well and may be iatrogenic. A recent study showed that a greater volume of free water prescription was associated with progression to severe hospital-acquired hypernatremia. The prescribed amount of free water was considered inadequate in the context of ongoing use of sodium-rich solutions and lower total volumes during progression of hypernatremia. Finally, hypernatremia is frequently associated with increased extracellular fluid volume, even outside intensive care units.

### Characteristics, symptoms, and outcome of severe dysnatremias present on hospital admission [^1178N7Up]. The American Journal of Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

Dysnatremias are common in critically ill patients and associated with adverse outcomes, but their incidence, nature, and treatment rarely have been studied systematically in the population presenting to the emergency department. We conducted a study in patients presenting to the emergency department of the University of Bern.

Methods

In this retrospective case series at a university hospital in Switzerland, 77,847 patients admitted to the emergency department between April 1, 2008, and March 31, 2011, were included. Serum sodium was measured in 43,911 of these patients. Severe hyponatremia was defined as less than 121 mmol/L, and severe hypernatremia was defined as less than 149 mmol/L.

Results

Hypernatremia (sodium > 145 mmol/L) was present in 2% of patients, and hyponatremia (sodium < 135 mmol/L) was present in 10% of patients. A total of 74 patients had severe hypernatremia, and 168 patients had severe hyponatremia. Some 38% of patients with severe hypernatremia and 64% of patients with hyponatremia had neurologic symptoms. The occurrence of symptoms was related to the absolute elevation of serum sodium. Somnolence and disorientation were the leading symptoms in hypernatremic patients, and nausea, falls, and weakness were the leading symptoms in hyponatremic patients. The rate of correction did not differ between symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. Patients with symptomatic hypernatremia showed a further increase in serum sodium concentration during the first 24 hours after admission. Corrective measures were not taken in 18% of hypernatremic patients and 4% of hyponatremic patients.

Conclusions

Dysnatremias are common in the emergency department. Hyponatremia and hypernatremia have different symptoms. Contrary to recommendations, serum sodium is not corrected more rapidly in symptomatic patients.

### Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus in childhood: assessment of volume status and appropriate fluid replenishment [^113cZFkC]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Patients affected by nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) can present with hypernatremic dehydration, and first-line rehydration schemes are completely different from those largely applied in usual conditions determining a mild to severe hypovolemic dehydration/shock. In reporting the case of a patient affected by NDI and presenting with severe dehydration triggered by acute pharyngotonsillitis and vomiting, we want to underline the difficulties in managing this condition. Restoring the free-water plasma amount in patients affected by NDI may not be easy, but some key points can help in the first line management of these patients: (1) hypernatremic dehydration should always be suspected; (2) even in presence of severe dehydration, skin turgor may be normal and therefore the skinfold recoll should not be considered in the dehydration assessment; (3) decreased thirst is an important red flag for dehydration; (4) if an incontinent patient with NDI appears to be dehydrated, it is important to place the urethral catheter to accurately measure urine output and to be guided in parenteral fluid administration; (5) if the intravenous route is necessary, the more appropriate fluid replenishment is 5% dextrose in water with an infusion rate that should slightly exceed the urine output; (6) the 0.9% NaCl solution (10 mL/kg) should only be used to restore the volemia in a shocked NDI patient; and (7) it could be useful to stop indomethacin administration until complete restoration of hydration status to avoid a possible worsening of a potential prerenal acute renal failure.

### Hemorrhagic encephalopathy induced by hypernatremia… [^114ECyLK]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Hyperosmolarity is characterized by an increase in the solute concentration of body fluids brought about by loss of water, inadequate water intake, or administration of large amounts of hypertonic solutions. When the osmolar concentration of the extracellular fluid is increased, transfer of water from cells to extracellular fluid exceeds that in the opposite direction. Net water movement is thus out of the cells, with resultant dilution of extracellular fluid and concentration of the fluid within cells themselves. If the solute which increases the extracellular fluid osmolarity is one which is in the main excluded from intracellular fluid, such as sodium and chloride ions, this disturbance in water distribution cannot be mitigated by movement of solute into cells. Hence, the ultimate effect of hypernatremia is dehydration of cells. This physicochemical disorder is most frequently encountered in infants and children with severe diarrhea and vomiting, but it also occurs in adults.

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines for the management of exercise-associated hyponatremia: 2019 update [^116humzq]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Pathogenesis of exercise-associated hyponatremia (EAH) — The primary mechanism leading to the majority of EAH cases is overconsumption of hypotonic fluids, likely in combination with nonosmotic stimulation of arginine vasopressin (AVP), and a hypovolemic form, although far less common than the symptomatic hypervolemic form, may be more prevalent in certain circumstances. AVP secretion may play a role in the majority of individuals with EAH, and release of AVP leads to water retention in the distal tubule of the kidney with a net result of lowering serum sodium; potential stimuli include nonspecific stresses, nausea/vomiting, hypoglycemia, exposure to heat, and possibly medication use such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.

### Undercorrection of hypernatremia is frequent and associated with mortality [^113ePgQa]. BMC Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Hypernatremia is diagnosed in 1 to 2% of patients admitted to the Emergency Department (ED). Such patients often have various underlying pathologies implicated in hypernatremia occurrence. In most cases, treatment of hypernatremia is started at ED, but there have been only two reports on the characteristics, symptoms, treatments, and outcomes of severely hypernatremic patients at ED.

The recommended hypernatremia correction speed, based on pediatric retrospective case-series, is 1 mmol/L/h when hypernatremia occurrence has been quick (a few hours) and 0.5 mmol/L/h when it has been long or is unknown. A too fast correction can induce cerebral edema and irreversible neurologic sequels that are avoided with a slow correction. Unless shock or hypotension are present, isotonic or hypertonic solutes are not recommended. Moreover, experts recommend first replacing fluid losses in dehydrated/hypovolemic patients by use of isotonic or slightly hypotonic fluids (e.g. lactated Ringer's).

To avoid over- or under-treatment, which both might cause neurological complications (cerebral edema, seizure, or coma), management of intravenous fluid must be rationalized. Mathematic calculation of water deficit based on sodium and water distribution in the intra- and extra-cellular spaces has been proposed. This requires two clinical data: natremia measurement and patient weight. For example, Adrogue and Madias's formula serves to calculate natremia variation after perfusion of one liter of solute according to the type of solute, initial natremia, and total body water volume: Attended natremia = ([Na] of solute – initial natremia)/(Total body water volume - 1). Most formulas consider the human body as a closed system and do not integrate undergoing losses of water. Furthermore, total body water volume required for calculation is extrapolated from weight regardless of the percentage of body fat variability. Also, these formulas were found to be imprecise in individual patients with deviations > 10 mmol/L. Their inappropriate use might lead to hypernatremia under-correction or worsening.

### Dextrose monohydrate, sodium chloride (Dextrose and sodium chloride) [^111iiy63]. FDA (2020). Medium credibility.

5.3 Hyponatremia

2.5% Dextrose and 0.45% Sodium Chloride Injection is a hypertonic solution [see Description, Table 1 (11)]. In the body, however, glucose containing fluids can become extremely physiologically hypotonic due to rapid glucose metabolization. Monitoring of serum sodium is particularly important for hypotonic fluids.

Depending on the tonicity of the solution, the volume and rate of infusion, and depending on a patient's underlying clinical condition and capability to metabolize glucose, intravenous administration of glucose can cause electrolyte disturbances, most importantly hypo- or hyperosmotic hyponatremia.

The risk for hyponatremia is increased, in pediatric patients, elderly patients, postoperative patients, those with psychogenic polydipsia and in patients treated with medications that increase the risk of hyponatremia (such as certain diuretic, antiepileptic and psychotropic medications) [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

Acute hyponatremia can lead to acute hyponatremic encephalopathy characterized by headache, nausea, seizures, lethargy and vomiting. Patients with brain edema are at particular risk of severe, irreversible and life-threatening brain injury. Patients at increased risk for developing complications of hyponatremia, such as hyponatremic encephalopathy include pediatric patients; women, in particular, premenopausal women; patients with hypoxemia; and in patients with underlying central nervous system disease [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4, 8.5)].

Avoid 2.5% Dextrose and 0.45% Sodium Chloride Injection in patients with or at risk for hyponatremia. If use cannot be avoided, monitor serum sodium concentrations.

Rapid correction of hyponatremia is potentially dangerous with risk of serious neurologic complications such as osmotic demyelination syndrome with risk of seizures and cerebral edema. To avoid complications, monitor serum sodium and chloride concentrations, fluid status, acid-base balance, and signs of neurologic complications.

High volume infusion must be used with close monitoring in patients with cardiac or pulmonary failure, and in patients with non-osmotic vasopressin release (including SIADH), due to the risk of hospital-acquired hyponatremia.

### Diagnosis and management of sodium disorders: hyponatremia and hypernatremia [^114xRHnt]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia and hypernatremia are common findings in the inpatient and outpatient settings. Sodium disorders are associated with an increased risk of morbidity and mortality. Plasma osmolality plays a critical role in the pathophysiology and treatment of sodium disorders. Hyponatremia and hypernatremia are classified based on volume status (hypovolemia, euvolemia, and hypervolemia). Sodium disorders are diagnosed by findings from the history, physical examination, laboratory studies, and evaluation of volume status. Treatment is based on symptoms and underlying causes. In general, hyponatremia is treated with fluid restriction (in the setting of euvolemia), isotonic saline (in hypovolemia), and diuresis (in hypervolemia). A combination of these therapies may be needed based on the presentation. Hypertonic saline is used to treat severe symptomatic hyponatremia. Medications such as vaptans may have a role in the treatment of euvolemic and hypervolemic hyponatremia. The treatment of hypernatremia involves correcting the underlying cause and correcting the free water deficit.

### Palliative care and the management of common distressing symptoms in advanced cancer: pain, breathlessness, nausea and vomiting, and fatigue [^115S2Eje]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2020). Medium credibility.

Nausea and Vomiting

Nausea, defined as the unpleasant subjective feeling of wanting to vomit or retch, and/or vomiting, are experienced by as many as 68% of patients with cancer at some point during their illness; during the last 6 weeks of life, the prevalence of nausea and vomiting is 40% or more. Poorly controlled nausea and vomiting is associated with physical, cognitive, and psychosocial distress, and can contribute to patient and family fears of death from dehydration and/or starvation.

Nausea and vomiting secondary to antineoplastic agents or radiation therapy should be anticipated and managed according to ASCO antiemetic, or equivalent, clinical practice guidelines. The latest ASCO antiemetic update includes evidence-based recommendations and information on the appropriate use of olanzapine, neurokinin 1 receptor antagonists, and use of subcutaneous 5-hydroxytryptamine-3 receptor antagonists.

Much less trial evidence is available for the use of antiemetics in patients with advanced cancer and nausea and vomiting unrelated to antineoplastic agents or radiation therapy. Instead, an etiologic or mechanism-based approach to choosing an antiemetic is commonly recommended. This approach requires clinicians to take a detailed history and perform a focused examination to determine the most likely underlying cause(s) of the patient's nausea and vomiting. In the advanced cancer population, the most common underlying causes of nausea and vomiting are chemical abnormalities (eg, renal or liver failure, hyponatremia, hypercalcemia); drugs (eg, opioids, antidepressants, antibiotics); infection; and impaired gastric emptying, as well as visceral and serosal causes of delayed gastrointestinal transit (bowel obstruction, gastric bleed, enteritis, constipation). - Once the most likely underlying cause of the patient's nausea and vomiting is determined, an appropriate antiemetic can then be selected based on the pathophysiology and receptors implicated (Table 1).

### Evaluation and management of dehydration in children [^117E2Vwv]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

The article discusses the evaluation of dehydration in children and reviews the literature on physical findings of dehydration. Pediatric dehydration is a common problem in emergency departments and wide practice variation in treatment exists. Dehydration can be treated with oral, nasogastric, subcutaneous, or intravenous fluids. Although oral rehydration is underutilized in the United States, most children with dehydration can be successfully rehydrated via the oral route. Selection of oral rehydration solution and techniques for successful oral rehydration are presented. Appropriate selection and rate of administration of intravenous fluids are also discussed for isonatremic, hyponatremic, and hypernatremic dehydration.

### North American society for pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology, and nutrition 2025 guidelines for management of cyclic vomiting syndrome in children [^1164kQq3]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2025). High credibility.

Recommendation 6 — The guideline panel suggests IV fluid administration at the early treatment of acute CVS episodes guided by patient age, symptom severity, and degree of dehydration (conditional recommendation, based on very low certainty in the evidence of effects). Remarks state there is no research evidence regarding use of D10 vs. D5 IV fluids in this setting and no recommendations for specific IV fluids are made due to lack of evidence and potential for delay if specialized fluids are utilized; IV fluids should be determined by the evaluating clinician and provided similarly to other children with acute onset vomiting, with goals of rehydration and alleviation of electrolyte disturbances and ketosis. Background notes that a prior pediatric expert consensus recommended dextrose 10% (D10) over dextrose 5% (D5), but the guideline panel found no published evidence supporting this practice, and the panel was unable to judge the desirable effects of D10 versus D5 given the lack of evidence.

### Daily laxative therapy reduces organ dysfunction in mechanically ventilated patients: a phase II randomized controlled trial [^113gjD7s]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

For all patients, we recorded the general descriptive data as described in Additional file 1. The effectiveness of the protocol was assessed throughout the treatment period, primarily by the number of defecations per day, which was defined as the total number of defecations occurring during the treatment period divided by the total days of observation. We measured the percentage of days without evacuation during the observation period and the time to the first defecation. For patients who did not defecate during the treatment period, we considered the number of hours of observation. The percentage of days in which enemas were used and the mean daily dose of lactulose were also recorded. We also assessed the frequency of constipation, defined as the absence of stools for more than 3 consecutive days without mechanical obstruction according to the unit's protocol for obstipation management.

We assessed adverse events (AEs) during the entire study period. We considered only those events with higher potential associations with the laxative therapy. Thus, we focused on the occurrences of diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal distension, dermatitis, pressure ulcers, electrolyte disturbances (hypernatremia, hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia), gastric reflux, gastrointestinal bleeding and Ogilvie's syndrome (see Additional file 1 for details). We considered diarrhea as the presence of three or more defecations in a given day as previously defined. Serious adverse events included Ogilvie's syndrome, any gastrointestinal bleeding, hypernatremia ≥ 160 mEq/l, hypokalemia ≤ 2.5 mEq/l or hypomagnesemia ≤ 1.0 mEq/l and any other serious event that may have been related to the protocol in the opinion of the attending physician.

### A clinical approach to the treatment of chronic hypernatremia [^111Jhniq]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Hypernatremia is a commonly encountered electrolyte disorder occurring in both the inpatient and outpatient settings. Community-acquired hypernatremia typically occurs at the extremes of age, whereas hospital-acquired hypernatremia affects patients of all age groups. Serum sodium concentration is linked to water homeostasis, which is dependent on the thirst mechanism, arginine vasopressin, and kidney function. Because both hypernatremia and the rate of correction of hypernatremia are associated with significant morbidity and mortality, prompt effective treatment is crucial. Chronic hypernatremia can be classified into 3 broad categories, hypovolemic, euvolemic, and hypervolemic forms, with each form having unique treatment considerations. In this teaching case, we provide a clinically based quantitative approach to the treatment of both hypervolemic and hypovolemic hypernatremia, which occurred in the same patient during the course of a prolonged illness.

### Water (sterile water) [^115RXGTU]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

OVERDOSAGE

Overdosage (hypotonic expansion) is a function of an increase in fluid intake over fluid output, and occurs when the increase in the volume of body fluids is due to water alone. Overdosage may occur in patients who receive large quantities of electrolyte-free water to replace abnormal excessive fluid losses, in patients whose renal tolerance to water loads is exceeded, or in patients who retain water postoperatively in response to stress.

Manifestations of water intoxication are behavioral changes (confusion, apathy, disorientation and attendant hyponatremia), central nervous system disturbances (weakness, muscle twitching, headaches, nausea, vomiting, convulsions) and weight gain.

Treatment consists of withholding fluids until excessive water is excreted. In severe hyponatremia it may be necessary to cautiously administer hypertonic saline to increase extracellular osmotic pressure and excretion of excess water by the kidneys.

### HYPERNATREMIA IN INFANTS: an evaluation of the clinical and biochemical findings accompanying this state… [^112qMsQe]. publications.aap.org (2025). Medium credibility.

It has been shown that hypernatremia may accompany dehydration in infants with diarrhea and with infections associated with interference with water intake. Suitable modification of the treatment dehydration for these patients has appeared to improve the results of their care. Hypernatremic dehydration may be suspected from the history and clinical features and is readily diagnosed by laboratory procedures. The occurrence of neurological manifestations, some of which may be irreversible, is a feature of outstanding importance. Despite loss of body water the usual changes in tissue turgor and the circulatory state associated with severe dehydration may not be present. Because in this type of dehydration, a large intracellular water deficit exists, the repair solution should be relatively dilute with respect to sodium. The best results have been obtained by administering fluids which, if combined, would have a final sodium concentration of from 15 to 40 mEq. /l.

Hypocalcemia has been a frequent complication and more study is needed to elucidate its pathogenesis. Awareness of its occurrence facilitates therapy. As in other types of dehydration in infants, the potassium deficit may be impressive and should be corrected promptly after restoration of renal function. The somewhat special treatment indicated for patients with hypernatremic dehydration makes recognition important. Recognition or suspicion from clinical signs and rapid laboratory diagnosis are essential for optimal management. Comments.

### Endocrine dysfunction after traumatic brain injury: an ignored clinical syndrome? [^113sAYkf]. Neurocritical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Diabetes Insipidus and Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone Secretion After Traumatic Brain Injury

Injury to the hypothalamus, posterior pituitary, or pituitary stalk may cause water and electrolyte abnormalities. DI occurs because of underproduction of antidiuretic hormone (ADH), leading to fluid and electrolyte imbalance. For diagnosing DI, exclusion of the effect of osmotic agents and hyperglycemia is paramount. The diagnostic criteria for DI are given in Table 1. The incidence of severe DI with gross hypernatremia was found to be 2.9%. In the early period after injury, the overall incidence of DI is about 22–26%. Patients with TBI have impaired consciousness, as well as nausea, vomiting, and pain, and receive osmotic diuretics for raised ICP, leading to decreased total intake. Occurrence of polyuria leads to much more water loss, resulting in a negative water balance. The consequent hypernatremia and dehydration add to the morbidity. It has been suggested that patients with features of acute DI should undergo screening for anterior pituitary dysfunction. Though most of the times it is transient, still in around 6.9% of the patients with TBI, DI may persist even 6–36 months after injury.

Hyponatremia (Na level < 135 mmol/l) is the most common (20%) electrolyte abnormality seen after TBI. Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) has been observed in 12.7% of patients with TBI in the acute phase. It is also usually transient but can cause hyponatremia, increase cerebral edema, and even precipitate seizures. Acute ACTH deficiency can coexist in patients with TBI and is one of the reasons for hyponatremia. For making a diagnosis of SIADH, glucocorticoid deficiency, severe hypothyroidism, and the antiseizure drug carbamazepine need to be excluded. Patients who develop hypotension, hypoglycemia, and hyponatremia are likely to have ACTH deficiency and should be screened for it.

### Saline versus balanced solutions: are clinical trials comparing two crystalloid solutions really needed? [^112mTDH6]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

How do we prescribe fluids?

The choice of intravenous fluid should be based on consideration of certain baseline factors, but also on elements that arise during therapy. For example, at baseline, administration of saline may be indicated in the presence of hypochloremia whereas a hypotonic fluid may be warranted in the presence of hypernatremia. Importantly, the situation may evolve with time as the fluid administered may induce metabolic changes leading to a different "best" fluid choice. Giving several liters of 0.9% saline will result in hyperchloremia, so continuing this fluid strategy is not rational.

The mean maximum daily residual volume was lower in Group A than Group B at 70.2 ± 74.4 ml/day vs.109.6 ± 140.7 ml/day, respectively, showing a good gastric tolerance to the EN formula. Diarrhea, defined as > 3 episodes in 24-h, occurred in patients in both groups. In total, 11 patients experienced diarrhea (34.4% of 32), five in Group A and six in Group B. Two patients in Group A discontinued the study early due to hypernatremia. There were 3 early withdraws in Group B due to hypernatremia and diarrhea (1 patient), diarrhea (1 patient) and diarrhea and vomiting (1 patient). There was no significant difference in diarrhea episodes between the two groups.
