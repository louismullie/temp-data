## Question

What is the recommended Lovenox dose for DVT prophylaxis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for the recommended Lovenox (enoxaparin) dose for DVT prophylaxis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the FDA-labeled prophylaxis regimens by indication (medical illness, abdominal surgery, orthopedic surgery). Then, I should verify the renal dosing threshold and adjustments. Next, I will evaluate how obesity alters fixed-dose performance and whether weight-based dosing and anti-Xa monitoring improve adequacy. After that, I should consider high-risk groups like trauma, pregnancy, and cancer. Finally, I will consolidate duration recommendations and provide a concise, individualized dosing summary with safety checks.

> Let me first confirm the labeled prophylaxis regimens so we are anchored to on-label standards before individualizing. For acutely ill medical inpatients, the labeled regimen is 40 mg subcutaneously once daily for 6–11 days, which I should confirm as the default medical ward dose [^1124UVX8]. For abdominal surgery, the labeled regimen is 40 mg SC once daily, initiated 2 hours before incision and continued for 7–10 days, so I need to remember the true preoperative start here rather than delaying to postoperative day 1 [^114xjgUe]. For major orthopedic surgery, I initially thought in terms of a "loading dose"; wait, let me verify the label language — this is better described as starting 30 mg SC every 12 hours beginning 12–24 hours after surgery, with prophylaxis continued 7–10 days and often extended up to 35 days, and this approach is broadly applied in knee replacement and commonly used in hip replacement as well on U.S. labeling and practice summaries [^11417MoF] [^115X4cci].

> I need to check renal dosing next because accumulation meaningfully increases bleeding risk. Hold on, I should verify the exact creatinine clearance threshold: for CrCl less than 30 mL/min, reduce prophylaxis to 30 mg SC once daily; if CrCl is 30 mL/min or higher, no adjustment is required, though I should still monitor for bleeding and consider clinical frailty and concomitant antiplatelets [^113uZiK1] [^1178n9SV] [^112npfyq]. I should confirm safety cautions as well — bleeding, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, and high-risk procedural contexts warrant vigilance and may argue for UFH or mechanical prophylaxis when bleeding risk is prohibitive [^112wJ1oi].

> Next, I will examine obesity because fixed 40 mg once daily is frequently inadequate in higher-BMI populations. Let me think about the pharmacodynamic data: in surgical and emergency general surgery cohorts, standard 40 mg once daily yields a high proportion of subprophylactic anti-Xa levels, supporting that many patients need more than the fixed dose, particularly as weight increases [^112k5i2A] [^114z1Gsr]. I should double-check bariatric surgery data — escalating to 40 mg every 12 hours improved anti-Xa compared with 30 mg every 12 hours, though even BMI-tiered regimens (40 mg BID if BMI < 50 kg/m²; 60 mg BID if BMI ≥ 50 kg/m²) show mixed adequacy and sometimes overshoot, emphasizing the need for monitoring in extremes of BMI [^1155uECp] [^113D4WMb] [^1155uECp]. Weight-based dosing at 0.5 mg/kg once daily has repeatedly achieved target prophylactic anti-Xa more reliably than fixed 40 mg, including in extremely obese cohorts, without clear excess bleeding in small studies; still, I should acknowledge these are mostly single-center data and not label-based [^115gHP4v] [^116fHbTe].

> I should confirm when anti-factor Xa monitoring is useful and what targets to use. For high-risk groups such as morbid obesity, trauma/ICU, thoracic or bariatric surgery, and renal insufficiency, monitoring a peak anti-Xa level about 4 hours after the third dose is reasonable; typical prophylactic targets range from 0.2–0.4 IU/mL, with some programs using 0.3–0.5 IU/mL, and dose adjustments of roughly 10 mg increments are commonly employed when levels are sub- or supra-prophylactic [^1125ABTT] [^116EUdUJ] [^114z1Gsr]. Wait, let me verify alternative target ranges in regulatory and PK sources — prophylaxis targets of 0.1–0.3 or 0.2–0.4 IU/mL are described in pharmacology references and pediatric PK modeling, reinforcing that programs should pick and consistently apply a local target window [^114cESr8].

> Trauma patients deserve special attention because standard fixed doses are often inadequate. I will now examine the trauma data: initiating at 30 mg SC twice daily is customary, but most moderate-to-severely injured trauma patients require dose increases to achieve target anti-Xa levels, and anti-Xa–guided adjustment appears to reduce VTE without excess bleeding; in fact, many require at least 40 mg per dose, and patients with higher creatinine clearance may need more because they clear enoxaparin faster [^1125ABTT] [^1155uECp]. Hold on, I should verify TBI nuances — recent data suggest creatinine clearance predicted dose requirement better than weight, implying that rapid renal clearance can drive under-anticoagulation even when using BID regimens in TBI patients, which argues for early anti-Xa checks in this subset [^114TSHLV].

> Pregnancy and the peripartum period require tailored dosing and careful monitoring. Let me reconsider the labeled prophylaxis for pregnancy: standard prophylaxis is 40 mg SC once daily, with some scenarios using intermediate-intensity 40 mg every 12 hours, and mechanical heart valves in pregnancy require especially close anti-Xa monitoring and specialist oversight due to valve thrombosis risk [^116MdAkT] [^1143Y6J4] [^112wJ1oi]. After cesarean delivery, wait a minute, fixed dosing underperforms in higher BMI groups — weight-based 0.5 mg/kg every 12 hours achieved prophylactic anti-Xa levels more consistently than fixed 40 mg regimens, supporting consideration of weight-based strategies in morbid obesity postpartum when bleeding risk allows [^114FYaJR] [^112QBBSP].

> I need to ensure duration is appropriate to the indication and risk profile. For abdominal surgery, 7–10 days is standard, for medical illness 6–11 days is typical, and for major orthopedic surgery extending prophylaxis up to 35 days reduces late events; in selected high-risk scenarios such as bariatric surgery or cancer surgery, extended prophylaxis is commonly considered based on institutional protocols and oncology guidance [^114xjgUe] [^1124UVX8] [^11417MoF] [^1146igvx]. But wait, what if bleeding risk is high or neuraxial anesthesia is involved? I should confirm that timing relative to neuraxial catheters and the overall hemorrhage risk may necessitate alternative strategies such as UFH or mechanical prophylaxis per procedural and anesthetic guidance, and that the exact duration must balance VTE risk against bleeding risk on a case-by-case basis [^112wJ1oi].

> Putting this together, I will now state a concise, individualized recommendation with built-in checks. For most acutely ill medical inpatients and for abdominal surgery, use enoxaparin 40 mg SC once daily, starting 2 hours pre-op for abdominal surgery and continuing about 7–10 days for surgery or 6–11 days for medical illness, while reassessing bleeding risk daily [^114xjgUe] [^1124UVX8]. For major orthopedic surgery such as knee (and commonly hip) replacement, use 30 mg SC every 12 hours starting 12–24 hours post-op, and extend prophylaxis up to 35 days when feasible, with anti-Xa monitoring in very high-risk or obese patients if available [^11417MoF] [^115X4cci]. If CrCl is less than 30 mL/min, reduce to 30 mg SC once daily; if CrCl is 30 mL/min or higher, no adjustment is required, but I should monitor closely for bleeding and drug interactions [^113uZiK1] [^1178n9SV] [^112npfyq]. In patients with obesity (especially BMI ≥ 40 kg/m²), standard 40 mg once daily is often subprophylactic, so consider either 40 mg twice daily, BMI-tiered 40–60 mg twice daily, or weight-based 0.5 mg/kg once or twice daily with peak anti-Xa monitoring to target roughly 0.2–0.4 IU/mL and dose-adjust by ~10 mg increments if sub- or supraprophylactic, provided bleeding risk is acceptable [^116EUdUJ] [^114z1Gsr] [^116fHbTe] [^115gHP4v] [^113D4WMb] [^114gubPp]. For trauma, start 30 mg twice daily and promptly escalate using anti-Xa levels because most patients require higher doses; consider that higher creatinine clearance predicts the need for higher doses in TBI patients, and recheck levels after adjustments [^1125ABTT] [^1155uECp] [^114TSHLV]. Throughout, I need to ensure platelet monitoring for HIT when clinically indicated and to pause or modify prophylaxis when procedural bleeding risk or neuraxial catheter management dictates, engaging multidisciplinary input as needed [^112wJ1oi].

For DVT prophylaxis with Lovenox (enoxaparin), use **40 mg SC once daily** for general medical patients [^1124UVX8], **30 mg SC every 12 hours** for orthopedic or high-risk surgical patients [^11417MoF] [^1162YaKk], and **30 mg SC once daily** if CrCl < 30 mL/min [^113uZiK1] [^1178n9SV]. Adjust dosing for **obesity, renal impairment, or bleeding risk** [^111XTXAR], and monitor for bleeding and thrombocytopenia [^112wJ1oi].

---

## Standard dosing regimens

Standard regimens for enoxaparin sodium (Lovenox) in **DVT prophylaxis** are:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Standard dose** | **Frequency** | **Duration** |
|-|-|-|-|
| General medical patients (acute illness) | 40 mg SC | Once daily | 6–11 days [^1124UVX8] |
| Orthopedic surgery (hip or knee replacement) | 30 mg SC | Every 12 hours [^113vixLZ] | 7–10 days, up to 35 days [^11417MoF] |
| Abdominal surgery | 40 mg SC | Once daily | 7–10 days [^114xjgUe] |
| Trauma patients (standard risk) | 30 mg SC | Every 12 hours [^1125ABTT] | Until ambulation or discharge |
| Trauma patients (high risk) | 40 mg SC | Every 12 hours | Until ambulation or discharge |

---

## Dose adjustments based on patient-specific factors

### Renal impairment

Enoxaparin is primarily eliminated by the kidneys; **dose adjustments are necessary in renal impairment** [^111XTXAR]. Patients with **CrCl ≥ 30 mL/min** require no adjustment and should receive standard dosing [^112npfyq], whereas those with **CrCl < 30 mL/min** should receive 30 mg SC once daily for thromboprophylaxis [^113uZiK1] [^1178n9SV].

---

### Obesity

Obese patients **may require higher doses** to achieve adequate prophylactic anti-Xa levels [^113LEw65]. For patients with **BMI ≥ 40 kg/m²**, consider weight-based dosing (0.5 mg/kg once daily) [^115gHP4v] or increased fixed dosing (e.g. 40 mg SC every 12 hours) [^1125Xgsp]. For those with **BMI ≥ 50 kg/m²**, even higher doses (e.g. 60 mg SC every 12 hours) may be necessary, particularly in bariatric surgery patients [^114gubPp] [^116EUdUJ].

---

### Bleeding risk

Patients with an **increased bleeding risk** may require dose adjustments or alternative prophylactic strategies [^112wJ1oi]. In patients at **high bleeding risk**, consider lower doses or alternative anticoagulants (e.g. unfractionated heparin) [^1125qpcC].

---

## Clinical outcomes associated with different dosing regimens

Enoxaparin dosing regimens are associated with different **clinical outcomes**:

- **Standard dosing (40 mg once daily)**: Effective in general medical patients [^1124UVX8] but may be inadequate in obese or high-risk surgical patients [^112k5i2A] [^114z1Gsr].
- **Higher dosing (40 mg every 12 hours)**: More effective in obese and high-risk surgical patients, achieving adequate anti-Xa levels [^114gubPp] and reducing VTE incidence [^112C97kJ].
- **Weight-based dosing (0.5 mg/kg once daily)**: Effective in morbidly obese patients [^116fHbTe], achieving target anti-Xa levels without excessive anticoagulation [^115gHP4v].

---

## Monitoring and safety considerations

Regular **monitoring and safety** are essential when administering enoxaparin:

- **Bleeding**: Monitor for signs of bleeding, particularly in patients with renal impairment or high bleeding risk [^112wJ1oi] [^111XTXAR] [^11441sNA].
- **Thrombocytopenia**: Monitor platelet counts regularly due to the risk of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) [^112wJ1oi] [^11441sNA].
- **Anti-Xa levels**: Consider monitoring anti-Xa levels in obese patients [^114gubPp], renal impairment, or high-risk surgical patients to ensure adequate prophylaxis [^114z1Gsr] [^1125ABTT].

## Summary of recommended dosing regimens

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended dose** | **Frequency** | **Duration** |
|-|-|-|-|
| General medical patients | 40 mg SC | Once daily | 6–11 days [^1124UVX8] |
| Orthopedic surgery | 30 mg SC | Every 12 hours [^11417MoF] | 7–10 days |
| Abdominal surgery | 40 mg SC | Once daily | 7–10 days [^114xjgUe] |
| Trauma patients (standard risk) | 30 mg SC | Every 12 hours [^1125ABTT] | Until ambulation |
| Trauma patients (high risk) | 40 mg SC | Every 12 hours | Until ambulation |
| Renal impairment (CrCl < 30 mL/min) | 30 mg SC | Once daily [^113uZiK1] | As indicated |
| Obesity (BMI ≥ 40 kg/m²) | 0.5 mg/kg SC [^115gHP4v] | Once daily | As indicated |
| Obesity (BMI ≥ 50 kg/m²) | 60 mg SC [^114gubPp] | Every 12 hours | As indicated |

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of enoxaparin sodium SC (also known as Lovenox):

- **Decreased platelet count**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as thrombocytopenia can occur with the use of enoxaparin.

- **Gasping syndrome**: Use caution in infants, as enoxaparin sodium vials contain benzyl alcohol preservative.

- **Hemorrhage**: Use caution in patients undergoing PCI. If manual compression is used at the puncture site after PCI, remove the sheath 6 hours after the last enoxaparin dose. Administer the next scheduled dose no sooner than 6–8 hours after sheath removal.

- **Hemorrhage**: Use caution in patients with bleeding disorder, uncontrolled hypertension, or a history of recent gastrointestinal ulceration, diabetic retinopathy, renal dysfunction, or hemorrhage.

- **Hemorrhage**: Use extreme caution in patients at high risk of hemorrhage, including bacterial endocarditis, congenital or acquired bleeding disorders, active ulcerative or angiodysplastic gastrointestinal disease, hemorrhagic stroke, recent brain, spinal, or ophthalmologic surgery, or concomitant use of platelet inhibitors.

- **Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as enoxaparin may cause heparin-induced thrombocytopenia with or without thrombosis.

- **Prosthetic valve thrombosis**: Use caution in thromboprophylaxis in pregnant women with mechanical prosthetic heart valves, as the risk of thromboembolism is higher in this population. Obtain frequent monitoring of peak and trough anti-factor Xa levels and adjust dosage.

### Safety and efficacy of high-dose unfractionated heparin versus high-dose enoxaparin for venous thromboembolism prevention in morbidly obese hospitalized patients [^1125Xgsp]. The American Journal of Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Venous thromboembolism is a cause of morbidity and mortality in hospitalized patients, and morbid obesity increases this risk. Various prophylaxis dosing strategies have been investigated. However, it is unclear if high-fixed dose enoxaparin or high-fixed dose unfractionated heparin thromboprophylaxis is optimal for minimizing the incidence of major bleeding and reducing hospital-acquired venous thromboembolism.

- **Methods**: A single-center retrospective observational study was conducted in hospitalized patients who were morbidly obese (body mass index ≥ 40 kg/m²) and who received either high-fixed dose enoxaparin (40 mg every 12 hours) or unfractionated heparin (7,500 units every 8 hours) for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis. Co-primary outcomes included incidence of major bleeding and venous thromboembolism diagnosed during hospitalization. Predictors of major bleeding were evaluated by multivariable regression.

- **Results**: In the 305 patients included (n = 190 unfractionated heparin, n = 115 enoxaparin), the incidence of major bleeding was significantly higher in the unfractionated heparin group (odds ratio [OR] 1.85, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.07–3.13; P = 0.025), with no significant difference in the incidence of venous thromboembolism diagnosed during hospitalization. The only independent predictors of major bleeding were intensive care acuity (OR 3.32, 95% CI 1.91–5.78; P < 0.001) and selection of unfractionated heparin rather than enoxaparin for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis (OR 2.16, 95% CI 1.22–3.82; P = 0.008).

### Anti-Xa levels in bariatric surgery patients receiving prophylactic enoxaparin [^116EUdUJ]. Obesity Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Limited data exist regarding the efficacy and dosing of low-molecular-weight heparins, including enoxaparin, for morbidly obese patients. Prophylactic doses of 30 to 60 mg every 12 hours have been described in bariatric surgery patients, with appropriate anti-Xa levels reported between 0.18 and 0.6 units/mL.

- **Methods**: Fifty-two laparoscopic gastric bypass or banding patients were enrolled. Patients were divided into two groups based on the enoxaparin dose received: Group 1 received enoxaparin 30 mg every 12 hours, and Group 2 received enoxaparin 40 mg every 12 hours. Anti-Xa levels were obtained 4 hours after the first and third doses. Levels between 0.18 and 0.44 units/mL were considered appropriate.

- **Results**: There were 19 patients (74% female, mean body mass index [BMI] 48.4 kg/m²) in Group 1 and 33 patients (82% female, mean BMI 48.5 kg/m²) in Group 2. In Group 1, anti-Xa levels were 0.06 and 0.08 units/mL after the first and third doses, respectively. In Group 2, anti-Xa levels were 0.14 and 0.15 units/mL after the first and third doses, respectively (p = NS). There was a statistically significant difference in anti-Xa levels between Group 1's first dose and Group 2's first dose (p < 0.05), and between Group 1's third dose and Group 2's third dose (p < 0.05). The percentage of appropriate anti-Xa levels at the first dose differed, with 0% in Group 1 vs. 30.8% in Group 2 (p = 0.01), and at the third dose, 9.1% in Group 1 vs. 41.7% in Group 2 (p = 0.155).

- **Conclusion**: When the prophylactic dose of enoxaparin was increased from 30 mg every 12 hours to 40 mg every 12 hours in bariatric surgery patients, anti-Xa levels significantly increased.

### Creatinine clearance predicts the goal enoxaparin dose in traumatic brain injury [^114TSHLV]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2024). High credibility.

Patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) are at high risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Recent guidelines recommend starting TBI patients on enoxaparin 30 mg twice daily and then considering weight-based dosing. Creatinine clearance may be more effective than weight for determining high and low enoxaparin dose requirements. We hypothesize that creatinine clearance (CrCl) predicts the goal enoxaparin dose better than weight-based dosing.

- **Methods**: A retrospective review was conducted on patients admitted to an urban, academic Level I trauma center from August 2017 to February 2020. Patients were included if they were over 18 years old, admitted for more than 48 hours, and had a head and neck AIS ≥ 3. Patients were excluded if they did not have TBI, received deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis other than enoxaparin 12-hour dosing, if no anti-Xa levels were drawn, or if the goal anti-Xa level was not reached. Patients were grouped into dosing cohorts based on the dose of enoxaparin required to reach the goal. Pearson's correlation was used to compare mean CrCl and mean weight across dosing cohorts.

- **Results**: A total of 120 patients met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The mean age was 47 years, and 68% of patients were male. The mean hospital length of stay was 24 days. There were 5 (4.2%) cases of deep vein thrombosis, no cases of pulmonary embolism, and 5 (4.2%) patient deaths. Mean CrCl increased significantly with increased dosing of enoxaparin, with a Pearson's correlation coefficient of 0.484 (p < 0.001). Weight on admission also increased with increasing enoxaparin dose requirements, with a Pearson's correlation coefficient…

### Fixed dose subcutaneous low molecular weight heparins versus adjusted dose unfractionated heparin for venous thromboembolism [^114g2ubn]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Low molecular weight heparins (LMWHs) have been shown to be effective and safe in preventing venous thromboembolism (VTE) and may also be effective for the initial treatment of VTE. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 1999 and previously updated in 2004.

- **Objectives**: To determine the effect of LMWH compared with unfractionated heparin (UFH) for the initial treatment of VTE.

- **Search strategy**: Trials were identified by searching the Cochrane Peripheral Vascular Diseases Group Specialised Register and CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library). Colleagues and pharmaceutical companies were contacted for additional information.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials comparing fixed dose subcutaneous LMWH with adjusted dose intravenous or subcutaneous UFH in people with VTE.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors assessed trials for inclusion and quality, and extracted data independently.

- **Main results**: Twenty-three studies were included (n = 9587). Thrombotic complications occurred in 3.6% of participants treated with LMWH compared with 5.3% treated with UFH (odds ratio (OR) 0.70; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.57 to 0.85). Thrombus size was reduced in 53% of participants treated with LMWH and 45% treated with UFH (OR 0.69; 95% CI 0.59 to 0.81). Major haemorrhages occurred in 1.1% of participants treated with LMWH compared with 1.9% treated with UFH (OR 0.58; 95% CI 0.40 to 0.83). In 19 trials, 4.3% of participants treated with LMWH died compared with 5.8% of participants treated with UFH (OR 0.77; 95% CI 0.63 to 0.93).

### Prospective comparison of three enoxaparin dosing regimens to achieve target anti-factor Xa levels in hospitalized, medically ill patients with extreme obesity [^116fHbTe]. American Journal of Hematology (2012). Low credibility.

Enoxaparin is commonly used to prevent venous thromboembolism (VTE) [1,2] but has not been well-studied in patients with extreme obesity, a population at high risk for VTE. We prospectively compared three enoxaparin dosing regimens for the achievement of goal peak anti-Factor Xa levels in medically ill patients (n = 31) with extreme obesity (body mass index (BMI) ≥ 40 kg/m²). Patients were assigned to receive fixed-dose (FD) enoxaparin 40 mg daily (QDay, n = 11), weight-based lower-dose (LD) enoxaparin 0.4 mg/kg QDay (n = 9), or weight-based higher-dose (HD) enoxaparin 0.5 mg/kg QDay (n = 11).

The average BMI and weight of the entire cohort were 62.1 kg/m² (range 40.5–82.4) and 176 kg (range 115–256 kg), and did not differ between groups. Peak anti-Factor Xa levels were significantly higher in the HD group compared to either LD or FD groups. Patients in the HD group achieved target anti-Factor Xa levels more frequently than the LD and FD groups (P < 0.05). Peak anti-Factor Xa levels did not correlate with age, weight, BMI, or creatinine clearance, demonstrating the predictability of weight-based enoxaparin dosing. There were no adverse events (e.g. bleeding, thrombosis, thrombocytopenia).

To our knowledge, this is the first prospective comparative study demonstrating that in extremely obese, medically ill patients, enoxaparin 0.5 mg/kg QDay is superior to FD and LD enoxaparin for the achievement of target anti-Factor Xa levels.

### Prophylactic enoxaparin adjusted by anti-factor Xa peak levels compared with recommended thromboprophylaxis and rates of clinically evident venous thromboembolism in surgical oncology patients [^112C97kJ]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2020). Low credibility.

Studies among populations at high risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) have demonstrated that recommended doses for enoxaparin thromboprophylaxis are associated with a high incidence of subprophylactic anti-factor Xa (anti-Xa) levels. This study examines the efficacy and safety of dose-adjusted enoxaparin guided by anti-Xa levels.

- **Study design**: Patients undergoing abdominal cancer operations had dose adjustments based on peak anti-Xa levels to attain a target of > 0.20 IU/mL and were prospectively enrolled. They were compared with a historic cohort of patients receiving recommended thromboprophylaxis. The incidence of in-hospital VTE and major bleeding after changes in enoxaparin dosing were monitored.

- **Results**: The study population comprised 197 patients — 64 in the prospective intervention group and 133 in the control group. Baseline characteristics were similar between the intervention and control groups, with the exception of the Caprini score (8.09 vs. 7.26; p = 0.013). In the intervention group, 50 of 64 patients (78.1%) initially had subprophylactic peak anti-Xa levels. The VTE rates were lower in the intervention group than in the control group (0% vs. 8.27%; p = 0.018). There were no differences in major bleeding events (3.12% vs. 1.50%; p = 0.597), rates of postoperative packed RBC transfusion (17.2% vs. 23.3%; p = 0.426), or mean hemoglobin on discharge (9.58 vs. 9.37 g/dL; p = 0.414). Therapeutic anti-Xa levels correlated positively with age (65.7 vs. 58.2 years; p = 0.022) and negatively with operating room time (203 vs. 281 minutes; p = 0.032) and BMI (25.3).

Superior bioavailability and simple weight-based dosing have made low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWH) the preferred agents for treatment and prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE) for most indications. Despite improved pharmacokinetics, there remain populations where appropriate LMWH dose intensity and frequency are open to question. **Obese patients**: These individuals have a lower proportion of lean body mass as a percentage of total body weight. As a result, LMWH dosing based on total body weight could cause supra-therapeutic anticoagulation. **Elderly patients**: In addition to having less lean body mass, elderly patients also present a higher incidence of age-related renal disease and an increased risk of bleeding. **Renal insufficiency**: This condition poses a risk of LMWH accumulation and increased risk of bleeding.

Among LMWH products, only dalteparin labeling recommends a maximum dose, though prospective data call into question the validity of this dose limitation. Additionally, because obese patients are already at higher risk of VTE recurrence, they may be particularly sensitive to subtherapeutic anticoagulation. Prospective data evaluating LMWH use in elderly patients have been limited to in-patient treatment, thus few recommendations can be made in this population other than close monitoring.

Renal insufficiency is a risk for bleeding during LMWH use. Available evidence supports the potential for enoxaparin accumulation, but not tinzaparin. Enoxaparin dose adjustment, either empiric or based on anti-Xa monitoring, has insufficient data to support widespread implementation. Unfractionated heparin, not reliant on renal elimination, may offer an alternative.

### Dabigatran, rivaroxaban, or apixaban versus enoxaparin for thromboprophylaxis after total hip or knee replacement: Systematic review, meta-analysis, and indirect treatment comparisons [^113vixLZ]. BMJ (2012). Low credibility.

This systematic review and meta-analysis indicates that a higher efficacy of the new type of anticoagulant is generally associated with a higher bleeding tendency in patients undergoing total hip or knee replacement surgery. When balancing efficacy (symptomatic venous thromboembolism) and safety (major bleeds and deaths), the different anticoagulants did not differ significantly.

Rivaroxaban seems more effective than enoxaparin in preventing symptomatic venous thromboembolism, but this comes at the cost of an increase in clinically relevant bleeds. These results were consistent across different studies without evidence of heterogeneity.

Dabigatran appears at least as effective as enoxaparin in reducing the risk of symptomatic venous thromboembolism, although the results are noticeable due to heterogeneity and wide confidence intervals. Surrogate venographic data on major and total venous thromboembolism indicates that the high dose (220 mg) is consistently non-inferior to enoxaparin. The low dose (150 mg) may provide an alternative in patients with anticipated increased exposure to dabigatran, such as those older than 75 years and those with moderate renal impairment. In our meta-analysis, the risk of clinically relevant bleeding was not significantly different between dabigatran and enoxaparin. However, the upper limit of the 95% confidence interval indicates that a relative risk of clinically relevant bleeding with dabigatran versus enoxaparin by 35% cannot be excluded.

Apixaban was associated with a lower rate of clinically relevant bleeding than enoxaparin.

### Anti-factor Xa monitoring of enoxaparin thromboembolism prophylaxis in emergency general surgery patients [^114z1Gsr]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2023). High credibility.

Rates of venous thromboembolism (VTE) remain high in emergency general surgery (EGS) patients despite chemical VTE prophylaxis. Emerging literature supports anti-factor Xa (AFXa) monitoring for patients on enoxaparin (LMWH), although a significant knowledge gap remains regarding the optimal dosing and monitoring in EGS patients. We hypothesize that standard dose VTE prophylaxis regimens provide inadequate VTE prophylaxis in EGS patients.

- **Study design**: A prospective cohort study of all adult EGS patients at a single institution between August 2021 and February 2022 receiving standard dose LMWH for VTE prophylaxis was performed. AFXa levels were obtained 4 hours after the third dose of enoxaparin with a target range of 0.3 to 0.5 IU/mL. Adjustment to dosing and repeat AFXa measurement after the adjusted third dose was obtained.

- **Results**: A total of 81 patients underwent AFXa monitoring, the majority (75%) of whom were started on 40 mg LMWH daily. Initial peak AFXa measurement was low in 87.7% of patients (mean 0.16 IU/mL). Of patients who had an initial low AFXa, remained admitted, and underwent dosing adjustment and AFXa reassessment (27%), the majority were adjusted to either 30 or 40 mg of LMWH twice daily (23.7% and 55%, respectively), with 82% of patients remaining low. There were no significant differences in demographics or BMI between those with low vs. adequate AFXa levels at either initial or subsequent measurement.

- **Conclusions**: Standard LMWH dosing provides inadequate AFXa inhibition for adequate VTE prophylaxis. These findings highlight the importance of personalized dosing strategies for improving prophylaxis effectiveness in EGS patients.

### Association between enoxaparin dosage adjusted by anti-factor Xa trough level and clinically evident venous thromboembolism after trauma [^111CaTyu]. JAMA Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Trauma patients are at high risk for developing venous thromboembolism (VTE). The VTE rate when enoxaparin sodium is dosed by anti-factor Xa (anti-Xa) trough level is not well described. This study aimed to determine whether targeting a prophylactic anti-Xa trough level by adjusting the enoxaparin dose would reduce the VTE rate in trauma patients.

The study was a single-institution, historic versus prospective cohort comparison conducted at an urban, academic, level I trauma center. The prospective cohort was enrolled from August 2014 to May 2015 and compared with a historic cohort admitted from August 2013 to May 2014. Trauma patients who received enoxaparin adjusted by anti-Xa trough level (adjustment group) were compared with those who received enoxaparin sodium at a dosage of 30 mg twice daily (control group). Patients were excluded if they were younger than 18 years, had a hospital stay of less than 2 days, or had preexisting deep vein thrombosis. Additional exclusions for the adjustment group included changes in the choice of thromboprophylaxis (such as heparin, enoxaparin once-daily dosing, early ambulation), hospital discharge before initial trough levels could be drawn, or incorrect timing of trough levels.

- **Exposures**: Anti-Xa trough levels were monitored in patients in the adjustment group receiving three or more consecutive doses of enoxaparin sodium, dosed at 30 mg twice daily. Patients with a trough level of 0.1 IU/mL or lower received enoxaparin sodium increased by 10-mg increments. After providing three adjusted doses of enoxaparin, the trough level was redrawn.

### Optimal dosing of prophylactic enoxaparin after surgical procedures: Results of the double-blind, randomized, controlled fixed or variable enoxaparin (FIVE) trial [^113LEw65]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2021). High credibility.

The accepted "one-size-fits-all" dose strategy for prophylactic enoxaparin may not optimize the medication's risks and benefits after surgical procedures. The authors hypothesized that weight-based administration might improve the pharmacokinetics of prophylactic enoxaparin when compared to fixed-dose administration.

- **Methods**: The Fixed or Variable Enoxaparin (FIVE) trial was a randomized, double-blind trial that compared the pharmacokinetic and clinical outcomes of patients assigned randomly to postoperative venous thromboembolism prophylaxis using enoxaparin 40 mg twice daily or enoxaparin 0.5 mg/kg twice daily. Patients were randomized after surgery and received the first enoxaparin dose 8 hours after surgery. Primary hypotheses were that (1) weight-based administration is noninferior to a fixed dose for avoiding underanticoagulation (anti-factor Xa 0.4 IU/ml). Secondary endpoints were 90-day venous thromboembolism and bleeding.

- **Results**: In total, 295 patients were randomized, with 151 assigned to fixed-dose and 144 to weight-based administration of enoxaparin. For avoidance of under anticoagulation, weight-based administration had greater effectiveness (79.9 percent versus 76.6 percent); the 3.3 percent (95 percent CI, -7.5 to 12.5 percent) greater effectiveness achieved statistically significant noninferiority relative to the a priori specified -12 percent noninferiority margin (p = 0.004).

### Analyzing the adequacy of BMI-tiered enoxaparin dosing for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis in the bariatric surgery population based on anti-factor Xa assay data [^114gubPp]. Obesity Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) events remain a leading cause of morbidity and mortality following bariatric surgery. Consequently, prophylactic BMI-tiered low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) regimens have been implemented; however, the adequacy of such prophylaxis has been questioned. The aim of this study was to evaluate the adequacy of BMI-based VTE prophylaxis using the anti-factor Xa (AFXa) assay in patients with obesity undergoing bariatric surgery.

- **Methods**: This was a retrospective review of adult patients undergoing Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RNYGB), laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG), or revisional bariatric procedures at a high-volume, community-based institution between January 2017 and December 2020. Patients received twice-daily, BMI-tiered dosing of LMWH post-operatively. Individuals with BMI < 50 kg/m² received 40 mg LMWH, while those with BMI ≥ 50 kg/m² received 60 mg LMWH. AFXa levels were analyzed 4–6 hours following the second or subsequent dose. Levels of 0.2–0.4 IU/mL were considered prophylactic.

- **Results**: A total of 203 patients (67% female) were included in the study. The median age and BMI were 46 years and 50.79 kg/m², respectively. Seventy-two percent of patients underwent RNYGB. Ultimately, 37% of patients did not achieve adequate prophylaxis, while 23% were supra-prophylactic. Among the 90 patients with BMI < 50, 17 were supra-prophylactic and 16 sub-prophylactic. In the group of 113 patients with BMI ≥ 50, 29 were supra-prophylactic and 14 sub-prophylactic. The adequacy of dosing did not differ significantly based on patient demographics.

- **Conclusion**: BMI-tiered LMWH dosing requires further evaluation to determine its effectiveness in achieving adequate prophylaxis for VTE in bariatric surgery patients.

### Enoxaparin 40 mg per day is inadequate for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis after thoracic surgical procedure [^112k5i2A]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Many patients undergoing thoracic surgical procedures experience venous thromboembolism (VTE) events despite receiving chemical prophylaxis. Enoxaparin's pharmacologic impact can be quantified using anti-Factor Xa (aFXa) levels. We hypothesized that enoxaparin 40 mg once daily would be inadequate for most inpatients undergoing thoracic surgical procedures and that a real-time dose adjustment algorithm would be effective.

- **Methods**: This prospective clinical trial enrolled inpatients scheduled for a thoracic surgical procedure and prescribed enoxaparin 40 mg once daily for VTE prophylaxis post-surgery. aFXa levels measured the anticoagulant effect of enoxaparin once a steady state was reached. Patients with aFXa levels out of range received real-time enoxaparin dose adjustments and repeat aFXa level assessments.

- **Results**: Ninety-three inpatients undergoing thoracic surgical procedures were prospectively enrolled. The majority (67.4%) had low peak aFXa levels (< 0.3 IU/mL), indicative of inadequate enoxaparin prophylaxis, while 30.3% had in-range aFXa levels (0.3 to 0.5 IU/mL). Patient weight had a moderate correlation (r² = 0.38) with peak aFXa levels. Factors such as patient weight, female sex, and preoperative creatinine were independent predictors of peak aFXa in a linear regression model. Real-time, protocol-driven enoxaparin dose adjustment significantly increased the proportion of patients achieving in-range aFXa levels (30.3% vs 97.6%, p < 0.001).

- **Conclusions**: Enoxaparin 40 mg once daily is inadequate for most inpatients undergoing thoracic surgical procedures.

### Updated guidelines to reduce venous thromboembolism in trauma patients: A Western Trauma Association critical decisions algorithm [^1125ABTT]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2020). High credibility.

Many trauma patients require dose adjustment after initiating enoxaparin due to variations in renal clearance, weight, bioavailability, and the coagulation cascade. Monitoring enoxaparin by anti-Xa levels is necessary. In one series, 84% of trauma patients required doses of 40 mg or more, and 18% required doses of 50 mg or more. Adjusting enoxaparin by anti-Xa peak or trough levels appears to lower the VTE rate without increasing bleeding complications in moderate to severely injured patients, trauma patients who require ICU admission, burn injuries, and surgical oncology patients.

Although some debate exists on the appropriate target for anti-Xa levels, consensus suggests targeting 0.2 to 0.4 IU/mL for peak levels or 0.1 to 0.2 IU/mL for trough levels. Anti-Xa monitoring should also be considered for those patients who receive weight-based enoxaparin.

Although thromboelastography (TEG) has not been validated for monitoring pharmacologic prophylaxis, TEG with platelet mapping may assist with monitoring platelet inhibition. A randomized trial that used TEG as an adjunct to identify inadequate enoxaparin doses did not observe lower rates of VTE with the TEG-guided enoxaparin dosing. In contrast, TEG with platelet mapping may help determine if hypercoagulability is due to platelet function, which encourages the addition of aspirin to the pharmacologic prophylaxis regimen. If aspirin is added, the initial recommended dose is 81 mg daily, with the possibility of increasing the dose to 325 mg daily depending on subsequent TEG with platelet mapping results.

### Weight-based dosing of enoxaparin for VTE prophylaxis in morbidly obese, medically-ill patients [^115gHP4v]. Thrombosis Research (2010). Low credibility.

In clinical trials, fixed-dose enoxaparin (40 mg once daily) reduces the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in medically-ill patients. However, morbidly obese patients were under-represented in these trials, and using fixed-dose enoxaparin in obese patients may be inadequate. We completed a pharmacokinetic study in morbidly obese, medically-ill patients to determine if weight-based dosing of enoxaparin for VTE prophylaxis was feasible without excessive levels of anticoagulation, as determined by peak anti-Xa levels.

- **Materials and methods**: Twenty-eight morbidly obese (BMI ≥ 35 kg/m²) patients were enrolled and completed the study protocol. Enoxaparin 0.5 mg/kg was administered once daily subcutaneously, and peak anti-Xa levels were measured approximately 4–6 hours after the enoxaparin dose.

- **Results and conclusions**: Overall, 46% of patients were female. The average age (± SD) was 54 (± 11) years, and the average weight and BMI were 135.6 kg (± 25.3) and 48.1 kg/m² (± 11.1), respectively. The average daily dose of enoxaparin was 67 mg (± 12). The average peak anti-Xa level was 0.25 (SD ± 0.11, range 0.08 to 0.59) units/mL. Peak anti-Xa levels did not significantly correlate with weight or BMI. There were no bleeding events, symptomatic VTE, or significant thrombocytopenia. In morbidly obese, medically-ill patients, the use of weight-based enoxaparin dosed at 0.5 mg/kg once daily is feasible and results in peak anti-Xa levels within or near the recommended range for thromboprophylaxis, without any evidence of excessive anti-Xa activity.

### Pentasaccharides for the prevention of venous thromboembolism [^116mrD1U]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a common condition with potentially serious and life-threatening consequences. The standard method of thromboprophylaxis uses an anticoagulant such as low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) or warfarin. In recent years, another type of anticoagulant, pentasaccharide — an indirect factor Xa inhibitor — has shown a good anticoagulative effect in clinical trials. There are three types of pentasaccharides available: short-acting fondaparinux, long-acting idraparinux, and idrabiotaparinux. Pentasaccharides cause little heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and are better tolerated than unfractionated heparin, LMWH, and warfarin. However, no consensus has been reached on whether pentasaccharides are superior or inferior to other anticoagulative methods.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of pentasaccharides versus other methods of thromboembolic prevention (thromboprophylaxis) in people who require anticoagulant treatment to prevent venous thromboembolism.

- **Search methods**: The Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist (CIS) searched the Specialised Register (last searched March 2016) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2016, Issue 2). The CIS searched trial databases for details of ongoing and unpublished studies. Review authors searched LILACS (Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences) and the reference lists of relevant studies and reviews identified by electronic searches.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomised controlled trials on any type of pentasaccharide versus other anticoagulation methods (pharmaceutical or mechanical).

### Dose adjusting enoxaparin is necessary to achieve adequate venous thromboembolism prophylaxis in trauma patients [^1155uECp]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Standard venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis with enoxaparin results in inadequate protection in certain patients, with subtherapeutic plasma anti-Xa levels associated with elevated VTE rates. We hypothesized that many trauma patients would be subtherapeutic on the standard prophylactic dose of enoxaparin. Our goal was to adjust the enoxaparin dose to achieve target anti-Xa levels to take advantage of the drug based on its pharmacologic properties.

- **Methods**: Patients admitted to the trauma service were included if they received at least three doses of prophylactic enoxaparin and underwent at least two screening venous duplex examinations. Peak plasma anti-Xa levels of 0.2 IU/mL or less were considered low, and the dose was increased by 10 mg twice daily until adequate anti-Xa levels were obtained. A strict screening venous duplex protocol was followed. Patients were excluded if they were diagnosed with a deep venous thrombosis before beginning enoxaparin or did not have correctly timed anti-Xa levels.

- **Results**: Sixty-one trauma patients met inclusion criteria. There were three patients diagnosed with VTE (4.9%). Patients had a mean age of 45.9 years and were predominantly male (70.5%). Of the 61 patients, 18 (29.5%) had therapeutic anti-Xa levels on standard enoxaparin 30 mg twice daily. Compared with patients who had therapeutic anti-Xa levels on enoxaparin 30 mg twice daily, the 43 patients (70.5%) who were subtherapeutic were more likely to be male, have greater body weight, and a larger body surface area. There were no significant bleeding events in the group.

### Adjusted value of thromboprophylaxis in hospitalized obese patients: A comparative study of two regimens of enoxaparin: The ITOHENOX study [^115JNhWa]. Thrombosis Research (2017). High credibility.

Thromboprophylaxis is a mainstay of hospital care in patients at high risk of thrombosis. Fixed doses of low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) are recommended for thromboprophylaxis in patients admitted to the hospital for an acute medical condition. However, the distribution of LMWH is weight-based, and the efficacy of standard doses in obese patients may be decreased. Data for obese patients are mainly available in bariatric surgery with extremely obese patients who are at greater risk of venous thromboembolism than those hospitalized for a medical condition.

We conducted a randomized control trial in medically obese inpatients (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m²) assessing two regimens of enoxaparin (40 mg and 60 mg SQ daily) to determine whether a stronger dosage would achieve a higher anti-Xa level suitable for thromboprophylaxis. Between September 2013 and April 2015, 91 patients were included in the study (mean ± standard deviation age was 70.4 ± 10.7 years, average BMI 37.8 ± 6.4 kg/m²).

- **Main indications of thromboprophylaxis**:
	- Acute infection (50%), acute respiratory failure (10%), acute congestive heart failure (9%), and acute rheumatic disorders (18%).

- **Average anti-Xa activity**:
	- Measured 4 hours after the third administration of enoxaparin was 0.25 ± 0.09 IU/mL in group 1 (enoxaparin 40 mg) and 0.35 ± 0.13 IU/mL in group 2 (enoxaparin 60 mg) (P < 10⁻³). The proportions of patients with normal anti-Xa activity (between 0.32 and 0.54 IU/mL) were 31% (n = 11) and 69% (n = 24) in group 1 and 2 respectively (P = 0.007).

### Enoxaparin for thromboprophylaxis in morbidly obese patients undergoing bariatric surgery: Findings of the prophylaxis against VTE outcomes in bariatric surgery patients receiving enoxaparin (PROBE) study [^115M1sFa]. Obesity Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Obese patients undergoing bariatric surgery are at a significant risk for venous thromboembolism (VTE). We performed a multicenter, retrospective survey to evaluate the safety and efficacy of enoxaparin for thromboprophylaxis in patients with morbid obesity undergoing primary bariatric surgery.

- **Methods**: From January to December 2002, 668 patients who underwent primary bariatric surgery at five centers were analyzed retrospectively. Baseline patient demographics, objectively diagnosed cases of VTE, and bleeding events were recorded. Patients received enoxaparin preoperatively (30 mg) or postoperatively (40 mg) every 12 or 24 hours or upon discharge (30 mg every 24 hours for 10 days).

- **Results**: Overall, there were 6 (0.9%) pulmonary embolisms (PE) and 1 (0.1%) occurrence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT); all but 1 occurred after the cessation of thromboprophylaxis. The highest incidence of VTE was at Center B, which did not administer perioperative thromboprophylaxis (1 DVT and 2 PEs). There were 6 (0.9%) severe bleeding complications: 3 at Center D and 3 at Center E. In Center B, 2 deaths were recorded (0.3%): 1 due to sepsis and 1 due to bleeding, with both occurring after thromboprophylaxis was discontinued.

- **Conclusion**: The administration of enoxaparin, in various dosing regimens, is safe for thromboprophylaxis in morbidly obese patients undergoing bariatric surgery. Fewer events occurred with perioperative prophylaxis initiated in the hospital. Because all thromboembolic events occurred after the cessation of thromboprophylaxis, extended thromboprophylaxis may be of benefit.

### Heparin sodium [^1152RBbc]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Low-dose prophylaxis of postoperative thromboembolism has been demonstrated through a number of well-controlled clinical trials. These studies indicate that low-dose heparin prophylaxis, administered just before and after surgery, reduces the incidence of postoperative deep vein thrombosis in the legs (measured by the I-125 fibrinogen technique and venography) and clinical pulmonary embolism.

The most widely recommended dosage is 5,000 units administered 2 hours before surgery and then 5,000 units every 8 to 12 hours thereafter for 7 days, or until the patient is fully ambulatory, whichever is longer. The heparin is administered by deep subcutaneous injection in the arm or abdomen using a fine needle (25 to 26 gauge) to minimize tissue trauma. A concentrated solution of heparin sodium is recommended.

Such prophylaxis should be reserved for patients over the age of 40 undergoing major surgery. Exclusion criteria include patients with bleeding disorders, those undergoing neurosurgery, spinal anesthesia, eye surgery, or potentially sanguineous operations, as well as patients receiving oral anticoagulants or platelet-active drugs (see WARNINGS). Its value in hip surgery has not been established. The possibility of increased bleeding during surgery or postoperatively must be considered. If such bleeding occurs, discontinuation of heparin with neutralization by protamine sulfate is advisable. If thromboembolism develops despite low-dose prophylaxis, full therapeutic doses of anticoagulants should be administered unless contraindicated. All patients should be screened prior to heparinization to rule out any contraindications.

### Fixed dose subcutaneous low molecular weight heparins versus adjusted dose unfractionated heparin for venous thromboembolism [^114XrhPD]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Low molecular weight heparins (LMWH) have been shown to be effective and safe in preventing venous thromboembolism (VTE) and may also be effective for the initial treatment of VTE. This study aims to determine the effect of LMWH compared with unfractionated heparin (UFH) for the initial treatment of VTE.

- **Search strategy**: Trials were identified from the Cochrane Peripheral Vascular Diseases Group's Specialised Register, CENTRAL, and LILACS. Colleagues and pharmaceutical companies were contacted for additional information.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials comparing fixed dose subcutaneous LMWH with adjusted dose intravenous or subcutaneous UFH in people with VTE.

- **Data collection and analysis**: At least two reviewers assessed trials for inclusion and quality, and extracted data independently.

- **Main results**: Twenty-two studies were included (n = 8,867). Thrombotic complications occurred in 151/4,181 (3.6%) participants treated with LMWH, compared with 211/3,941 (5.4%) participants treated with UFH (odds ratio (OR) 0.68; 95% confidence intervals (CI) 0.55 to 0.84), spanning 18 trials. Thrombus size was reduced in 53% of participants treated with LMWH and 45% treated with UFH (OR 0.69; 95% CI 0.59 to 0.81), in 12 trials. Major haemorrhages occurred in 41/3,500 (1.2%) participants treated with LMWH, compared with 73/3,624 (2.0%) participants treated with UFH (OR 0.57; 95% CI 0.39 to 0.83), in 19 trials. In eighteen trials, 187/4,193 (4.5%) participants treated with LMWH died, compared with 233/3,861 (6.0%) participants treated with UFH (OR 0.76; 95% CI 0.62 to 0.92).

### Efficacy and safety considerations with dose-reduced direct oral anticoagulants: A review [^114pb5s3]. JAMA Cardiology (2022). Low credibility.

Dose-reduced regimens of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) may be used for two main purposes: dose-adjusted treatment intended as full-intensity anticoagulation (e.g. for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation [AF] in patients requiring dose reduction) or low-intensity treatment (e.g. extended-duration treatment of venous thromboembolism [VTE]). We reviewed randomized clinical trials (RCTs) to understand the scenarios in which dose-adjusted or low-intensity DOACs were tested and reviewed the labeled indications by regulatory authorities, using data from large registries to assess whether the use of dose-reduced DOACs in routine practice aligned with the findings of RCTs.

- **Observations**: Among 4,191 screened publications, 35 RCTs that used dose-adjusted DOACs were identified for dabigatran, apixaban, rivaroxaban, and edoxaban. Of these 35 RCTs, 29 were related to stroke prevention in AF. Efficacy and safety results for dose-adjusted DOACs in large RCTs of AF were similar to those found for full-dose DOACs. To our knowledge, dabigatran, apixaban, and rivaroxaban have not been studied as dose-adjusted therapy for acute VTE treatment. Low-intensity DOACs were identified in 37 RCTs. Low-intensity DOACs may be used for extended-duration treatment of VTE (apixaban and rivaroxaban), primary prevention in orthopedic surgeries (dabigatran, apixaban, and rivaroxaban), primary prevention in ambulatory high-risk cancer patients (apixaban and rivaroxaban), or (postdischarge) high-risk medical patients (rivaroxaban), in stable atherosclerotic vascular disease, or following a recent event.

### Weight-based compared with fixed-dose enoxaparin prophylaxis after cesarean delivery: A randomized controlled trial [^114FYaJR]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2022). High credibility.

To evaluate fixed compared with weight-based enoxaparin dosing to achieve prophylactic anti-Xa levels after cesarean delivery, individuals meeting institutional criteria for enoxaparin thromboprophylaxis were randomly allocated to fixed dosing (40 mg daily for body mass index [BMI, calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared] lower than 40; 40 mg every 12 hours for BMI 40 or higher) or weight-based dosing (0.5 mg/kg every 12 hours). Enoxaparin was initiated during inpatient hospitalization and continued at discharge for 14 days. Those with contraindications to anticoagulation, plans for therapeutic anticoagulation, or known renal impairment were excluded. The trial was unmasked.

The primary outcome was the prophylactic (0.2–0.6 international units/mL) peak anti-Xa level 4–6 hours after at least the third enoxaparin dose (at steady state). Secondary outcomes included subprophylactic and supraprophylactic peaks, outpatient peak, venous thromboembolism (VTE), and wound complications in the first 6 weeks postpartum. A sample size of 121 per group was planned. At interim analysis with 50% enrollment, the trial was stopped early for efficacy. Primary analyses followed the intention-to-treat principle with worst-case imputation for missing outcomes. Secondary analyses were complete case.

From June 2020 to November 2021, 74 individuals were randomized to weight-based enoxaparin and 72 to fixed-dose enoxaparin. Those who received weight-based dosing were more likely to achieve prophylactic anti-Xa levels than those receiving fixed doses.

### Optimal enoxaparin dosing strategies for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis and treatment of high body weight patients [^116xZ7H2]. Thrombosis Research (2021). Low credibility.

The objective of the study was to investigate the clinical outcomes and complications associated with the use of enoxaparin in obese patients, given that obesity is a risk factor for developing venous thromboembolism (VTE) and the optimal dosage of enoxaparin has not been established for this population.

- **Methods**: A retrospective, single-center observational study was conducted on obese patients treated with enoxaparin for VTE (n = 47) using a body mass index (BMI)-stratified dosing, thromboprophylaxis (n = 46), and non-obese controls (n = 20). Anti-Xa was employed to measure the efficacy of enoxaparin.

- **Results**: Patients with a median BMI of 36.3 kg/m² (range 30–52.7) and a median weight of 136 kg (range 68–240) received therapeutic enoxaparin at a median dose of 120 mg BID (range 60–200). A median targeted anti-Xa level of 0.79 (95% CI 0.72–1.03) IU/mL was achieved in 58% of patients. Dose adjustments were required in 25% of patients (reduction) and 16% (increase). Incidences of mild or major hemorrhage, or VTE, occurred in 10%, 2%, and 2% of patients, respectively. Patients with a median weight of 160 kg (range 130–245) were administered thromboprophylaxis with 40 mg BID enoxaparin. A targeted median anti-Xa level of 0.22 IU/mL (95% CI 0.19–0.24) was achieved in 59% of patients. Mild hemorrhage was noted in 2%, while no cases of major hemorrhage or VTE were reported. Control patients who received 40 mg enoxaparin daily did not develop VTE; however, 5% experienced minor bleeding events.

- **Conclusions**: A BMI-stratified therapeutic enoxaparin dosing regimen is a safe and effective therapy in obese patients. Fixed dosing without monitoring may not be appropriate. Thromboprophylaxis with 40 mg BID in obese patients was effective.

### Enoxaparin dosing after cesarean delivery in morbidly obese women [^112QBBSP]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2015). Low credibility.

To compare the adequacy of venous thromboembolism prophylaxis based on anti-Xa concentrations, a prospective sequential cohort study was conducted on morbidly obese women with BMIs of 40 or greater who underwent cesarean delivery. Participants received either weight-based or BMI-stratified enoxaparin dosing for thromboembolism prevention. The weight-based regimen consisted of 0.5 mg/kg of enoxaparin every 12 hours, while the BMI-stratified regimen provided 40 mg every 12 hours for BMIs of 40–59.9 and 60 mg every 12 hours for BMIs of 60 or greater. The primary outcome was attaining an anti-Xa concentration within the adequate thromboprophylaxis range (0.2–0.6 international units/mL).

- **Secondary outcomes**: Enoxaparin dosage, timing of dosing and anti-Xa concentration, estimated surgical blood loss, postoperative changes in hemoglobin and platelets, wound hematoma, and adverse reactions to enoxaparin. Univariate analysis was used to compare dosing regimens.

Forty-two women received weight-based enoxaparin, and 43 received BMI-stratified dosing. Anti-Xa concentrations were significantly higher in the weight-based group (0.29 ± 0.08 international units/mL) compared with the BMI-stratified group (0.17 ± 0.07 international units/mL, p < 0.001). Thirty-six participants (86%) on weight-based dosing had anti-Xa concentrations within the prophylactic range compared with 11 participants (26%) on BMI-stratified dosing.

### Lovenox [^111Yvfcy]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Mechanism of action**: Enoxaparin is a low molecular weight heparin which has antithrombotic properties.

- **Pharmacodynamics**: In humans, enoxaparin given at a dose of 1.5 mg/kg subcutaneously is characterized by a higher ratio of anti-Factor Xa to anti-Factor IIa activity (mean ± SD, 14.0 ± 3.1) based on areas under anti-Factor activity versus time curves compared to the ratios observed for heparin (mean ± SD, 1.22 ± 0.13). Increases of up to 1.8 times the control values were seen in the thrombin time (TT) and the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT).

Enoxaparin at a 1 mg/kg dose (100 mg/mL concentration), administered subcutaneously every 12 hours to patients in a large clinical trial, resulted in aPTT values of 45 seconds or less in the majority of patients (n = 1607). A 30 mg intravenous bolus immediately followed by a 1 mg/kg subcutaneous administration resulted in aPTT post-injection values of 50 seconds. The average aPTT prolongation value on Day 1 was about 16% higher than on Day 4.

### Anticoagulant treatment regimens in patients with Covid-19: A meta-analysis [^113gzyFi]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2022). Low credibility.

Data extraction and quality assessment

Three dosing strategies of anticoagulation are described throughout this article: (i) therapeutic-dose anticoagulation (mostly 1 mg/kg of enoxaparin twice daily or rivaroxaban 20 mg once daily); (ii) intermediate dose (mostly 1 mg/kg of enoxaparin once daily); and (iii) prophylactic dose (mostly 40 mg of enoxaparin once daily). Therapeutic-dose and intermediate-dose are summarized as "higher-dose anticoagulation". In cases where other LMWHs, such as bemiparin, dalteparin, or tinzaparin, fondaparinux, or unfractionated heparin were used, an equivalent therapeutic, intermediate, or prophylactic dose was administered.

The primary efficacy outcome was death from any cause. The outcomes were assessed at day 21 (ATTACC and REMAP-CAP), day 28 (HESACOVID and RAPID), or day 30 (ACTION, INSPIRATION, BEMICOP, HEP-COVID, XCOVID-19, and Perepu et al.) after randomization. Two trials (ATTACC and REMAP-CAP) reported only on in-hospital deaths. The secondary efficacy outcome was thromboembolic events, including arterial thromboembolic events (i.e. stroke, myocardial infarctions, peripheral arterial thromboembolisms, and others) and venous thromboembolic events (i.e. deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and others). Whenever possible, both the composite outcomes and the subtypes of thromboembolic events were reported. The composite of net adverse clinical events (NACE: a composite of death, venous thromboembolism, and major bleeding) was also calculated. The primary safety outcome was major bleeding, with definitions of major bleeding events differing between trials.

### Enoxaparin thromboprophylaxis in gastric bypass patients: extended duration, dose stratification, and antifactor Xa activity [^1146igvx]. Surgery for Obesity and Related Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Morbidly obese patients undergoing gastric bypass surgery are at risk for postoperative venous thromboembolism. Evidence-based recommendations regarding dosing and duration of thromboprophylaxis are lacking for morbidly obese surgical patients. The aims of this study were to evaluate the safety and efficacy of an extended duration, body mass index (BMI)-stratified enoxaparin thromboprophylaxis regimen in patients undergoing Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and to determine the resultant antifactor Xa (AFXa) activity in morbidly obese surgical patients.

- **Methods**: In this prospective open trial, 223 patients (75% female, mean BMI 50.4 kg/m²) undergoing Roux-en-Y gastric bypass were assigned to receive enoxaparin 40 mg (BMI < 50 kg/m²) every 12 hours during hospitalization and once daily for 10 days after discharge. The AFXa levels were monitored serially, and dose adjustments were made for results outside the target prophylactic range (0.2–0.4 IU/mL ± 10%) after the third dose. The safety and efficacy outcomes were major bleeding and venous thromboembolism.

- **Results**: Roux-en-Y gastric bypass was performed laparoscopically in 208 subjects (93%). The duration of surgery averaged 99.5 ± 31 minutes, and the median length of hospitalization was 3 days. The target prophylactic AFXa concentration was achieved by 74% of patients after the third enoxaparin dose; none reached the full anticoagulation concentration. One patient developed nonfatal venous thromboembolism (0.45%). Four patients required transfusion (1.79%). Bleeding was not significantly evident.

### Arixtra [^1162YaKk]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

In two randomized, double-blind clinical trials on patients undergoing hip replacement surgery, ARIXTRA 2.5 mg subcutaneously once daily was compared to enoxaparin sodium. In Study 1, it was compared to enoxaparin sodium 30 mg subcutaneously every 12 hours, while in Study 2, it was compared to enoxaparin sodium 40 mg subcutaneously once a day.

- **Study 1**:
	- A total of 2,275 patients were randomized, and 2,257 were treated.
	- **Patient demographics**: ages ranged from 18 to 92 years, mean age of 65 years, with 48% men and 52% women.
	- **Racial composition**: 94% Caucasian, 4% Black, less than 1% Asian, and 2% other races.
	- ARIXTRA was initiated 6 ± 2 hours (mean 6.5 hours) after surgery in 92% of patients, while enoxaparin was initiated 12 to 24 hours (mean 20.25 hours) post-surgery in 97% of patients.

- **Study 2**:
	- A total of 2,309 patients were randomized, and 2,273 were treated.
	- **Patient demographics**: ages ranged from 24 to 97 years, mean age of 65 years, with 42% men and 58% women.
	- **Racial composition**: 99% Caucasian and 1% other races.

Patients with a serum creatinine level higher than 2 mg/dL (180 micromol/L) or a platelet count less than 100,000/mm³ were excluded from both trials. In Study 2, ARIXTRA was initiated 6 ± 2 hours (mean 6.25 hours) after surgery in 86% of patients. Enoxaparin sodium was initiated 12 hours before surgery in 78% of patients. The first post-operative enoxaparin sodium dose was given within 12 hours post-surgery in 60% of patients and 12 to 24 hours post-surgery in 35% of patients, with a mean timing of 13 hours.

### A weight- and anti-Xa-guided enoxaparin dosing protocol for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis in intensive care unit trauma patients [^116nYNhP]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2021). Low credibility.

Trauma patients are at high risk for venous thromboembolism (VTE), and the optimal dosing strategy for prophylactic enoxaparin remains unknown. The purpose of this quality improvement project was to evaluate a weight-based and anti-Xa-guided enoxaparin dosing protocol in intensive care unit (ICU) trauma patients and to determine if the protocol led to reduced clinical VTE rates.

- **Materials and methods**: Adult trauma patients admitted for ≥ 48 hours to our surgical or neurosurgical ICUs who received ≥ 3 consecutive weight-based enoxaparin doses were eligible for inclusion in this pre-post implementation cohort study. Enoxaparin 30 mg every 12 hours was used for weight 50 to 100 kg and body mass index (BMI) < 40 kg/m². Enoxaparin 40 mg every 12 hours was used for weight > 100 kg or BMI ≥ 40 kg/m². Participants underwent post hoc analysis with peak anti-Xa level measurements collected at steady state.

- **Results**: There were 52 patients in the control group (received standard enoxaparin dosing without anti-Xa monitoring) and 52 in the intervention group (weight-based with anti-Xa monitoring). The intervention cohort had significantly fewer clinical VTE events than the control cohort (1.9% vs. 9.6%; p = 0.038). Those weighing > 100 kg were more likely to have sub-prophylactic anti-Xa levels than those weighing ≤ 69 kg.

- **Conclusions**: Our enoxaparin dosing protocol was safe and frequently achieved initial anti-Xa levels within the goal, indicating that weight-based dosing alone is a viable strategy.

### Alert-triggered patient education versus nurse feedback for nonadministered venous thromboembolism prophylaxis doses: A cluster-randomized controlled trial [^111PzeM6]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). High credibility.

Hospitalization is a primary risk factor for venous thromboembolism (VTE), and deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism are leading causes of preventable harm among patients in the hospital. As a result, national organizations focused on health care quality improvement, including the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and The Joint Commission, measure and report VTE prevention practices. Efforts to improve the prescription of VTE prophylaxis for hospitalized patients have achieved great success; however, evidence shows that many doses of prescribed pharmacologic VTE prophylaxis are not administered, most often due to patient refusal or poor patient-nurse communication. Missing even one dose of a VTE prophylaxis medication has been associated with developing VTE events. VTE prophylaxis medications are some of the most frequently nonadministered medications for hospitalized patients.

- **Reasons for nonadministration**: Nonadministration of prescribed pharmacologic VTE prophylaxis has been attributed to nurse attitudes, knowledge, and beliefs regarding the need for prophylaxis, as well as patients refusing doses. Recent American Society of Hematology guidelines do not address the nonadministration of prescribed doses, which is a missed opportunity to encourage best practices for VTE prevention. Previous interventions targeting nonadministration practices have significantly improved the administration of prescribed prophylaxis doses, including comprehensive VTE-specific nurse education and widespread patient education.

Most recently, we showed that a real-time, patient-centered education model can be effective.

### Inadequate enoxaparin dosing predicts 90-day venous thromboembolism risk among plastic surgery inpatients: An examination of enoxaparin pharmacodynamics [^1161WoUh]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Evidence-based plastic surgery guidelines support the effectiveness of once-daily enoxaparin prophylaxis. Despite prophylaxis, one in 25 highest risk patients experiences a venous thromboembolism event. The authors examined the pharmacodynamics of standard enoxaparin doses in plastic surgery patients to assess whether patient-level factors predict enoxaparin metabolism, if inadequate enoxaparin doses predict downstream venous thromboembolism events, and the effectiveness of a pharmacist-driven dose-adjustment protocol in preventing such events.

- **Methods**:
	- The authors recruited adult plastic surgery patients receiving postoperative enoxaparin at 40 mg/day. Steady-state peak anti-factor Xa levels, a marker of enoxaparin effectiveness and safety, were measured. Patients with out-of-range anti-factor Xa levels had real-time dose adjustments based on a written protocol. Patients were followed for 90-day venous thromboembolism events.

- **Results**:
	- Ninety-four patients were recruited, with 44 percent achieving in-range peak anti-factor Xa levels with standard enoxaparin dosing. Patient-level factors such as the extent of surgical injury and gross weight were independent predictors of enoxaparin metabolism. Patients with low anti-factor Xa levels were significantly more likely to experience 90-day venous thromboembolism (10.2 percent versus 0 percent; p = 0.041). Real-time dose adjustment significantly increased the proportion of patients with in-range levels (67.1 percent versus 44.3 percent; p = 0.002).

- **Conclusions**:
	- Based on pharmacodynamic data, the majority of plastic surgery patients require dose adjustments to achieve in-range anti-factor Xa levels, potentially reducing the risk of venous thromboembolism events.

### Assessment of empiric body mass index-based thromboprophylactic dosing of enoxaparin after bariatric surgery: Evidence for dosage adjustment using anti-factor Xa in high-risk patients [^113D4WMb]. Surgery for Obesity and Related Diseases (2021). Low credibility.

Despite thromboprophylaxis, postoperative deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism occur after bariatric surgery, perhaps because of failure to achieve optimal prophylactic levels in the obese population.

- **Objectives**: The aim of this study was to evaluate the adequacy of prophylactic dosing of enoxaparin in patients with severe obesity by performing an antifactor Xa (AFXa) assay.

- **Setting**: An academic medical center.

- **Methods**: In this observational study, all bariatric surgery cases at an academic center between December 2016 and April 2017 who empirically received prophylactic enoxaparin (adjusted by body mass index [BMI] threshold of 50 kg/m²) were studied. The AFXa was measured 3–5 hours after the second dose of enoxaparin.

- **Results**: A total of 105 patients were included; 85% were female with a median age of 47 years. In total, 16 patients (15.2%) had AFXa levels outside the prophylactic range: 4 (3.8%) cases were in the subprophylactic range and 12 (11.4%) cases were in the supraprophylactic range. Seventy patients had a BMI < 50 kg/m² and empirically received enoxaparin 40 mg every 12 hours; AFXa was subprophylactic in 4 (5.7%) and supraprophylactic in 6 (8.6%) of these patients. Of the 35 patients with a BMI ≥ 50 kg/m² who empirically received enoxaparin 60 mg every 12 hours, no AFXa was subprophylactic and 6 (17.1%) were supraprophylactic. Five patients (4.8%) had major bleeding complications. One patient developed pulmonary embolism on postoperative day 35.

- **Conclusion**: BMI-based thromboprophylactic dosing of enoxaparin after bariatric surgery could be suboptimal in 15% of patients.

### Use of real-world data and physiologically-based pharmacokinetic modeling to characterize enoxaparin disposition in children with obesity [^114cESr8]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2022). High credibility.

Enoxaparin is a low‐molecular‐weight (2,000–8,000 Da) heparin that prevents the formation of activated factor X (Xa), a serine protease that plays an essential role in the coagulation cascade. Despite the fact that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) label states that "the safety and efficacy of [enoxaparin] in children has not been established", enoxaparin is commonly dosed in children both with and without obesity. However, obesity‐induced pharmacokinetic (PK) changes and appropriate dosing in children with obesity remain unclear. While not indicated for pediatric populations, the FDA does recommend therapeutic drug monitoring of enoxaparin via anti‐Xa concentration in certain special populations, namely adults with renal impairment or obesity. Yet, direct measurement of enoxaparin concentration in plasma is challenging given that it is administered as a mixture of polymeric molecules with varying chain lengths. Therefore, measurement of anti‐Xa concentration in plasma serves as a surrogate for enoxaparin concentration: the higher the anti‐Xa concentration, the higher the degree of anticoagulation.

Therapeutic drug monitoring occurs by comparing maximum anti‐Xa concentration (at 4 hours post-dosing) to target ranges of 0.6–1.0 IU/mL for the treatment of deep vein thrombosis with or without pulmonary embolism, or 0.1–0.3 IU/mL for prophylaxis of deep vein thrombosis or ischemic complications from non–Q-wave myocardial infarction. Therapeutic drug monitoring and dose adjustment to achieve these target ranges help to mitigate the risk of subtherapeutic or supratherapeutic concentrations.

### Direct oral anticoagulant dose selection: Challenging cases [^1165bg7H]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2021). Low credibility.

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are administered in fixed doses without routine laboratory monitoring of their anticoagulant effect, based on the results of pivotal Phase III trials. In some of these trials, patients were randomly allocated to receive a higher or lower dose of a DOAC, whereas in others, most patients were given a standard dose, and only a subset deemed to be at risk of drug accumulation received a lower dose. Treatment guidelines recommend dosing DOACs according to the way they were tested in the trials. However, for some patients, the optimal dosing remains uncertain.

One example is patients with atrial fibrillation who are thought to have an unacceptably high risk of bleeding but do not meet the guideline criteria for dose reduction. Another example is patients with venous thromboembolism who have completed 3 to 6 months of anticoagulation and are eligible for extended treatment with a standard or reduced dose of DOAC. In this review, we present a case-based approach to DOAC dose selection in these two settings.

### Fondaparinux sodium compared with low-molecular-weight heparins for perioperative surgical thromboprophylaxis: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^1112y342]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

In this study, only head-to-head randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were considered, comparing fondaparinux with low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWHs). Only those trials published in English and meeting the inclusion criteria were taken into account. The LMWHs involved in these trials included enoxaparin sodium, dalteparin sodium, nadroparin calcium, parnaparin sodium, and tinzaparin sodium. Although the primary focus was on English publications, potential studies in other languages were also screened for English abstracts. Studies published from January 2000 to December 2017 qualified for inclusion since the first clinical trial comparing fondaparinux with LMWHs was published in 2001.

RCTs were deemed eligible if they enrolled both male and female adults aged 18 years or older. The focus was on patients undergoing major orthopedic surgeries, such as total hip replacement, total knee replacement, or hip fracture surgeries, as well as major general surgeries, like abdominal or cancer surgeries. The analysis targeted individuals with surgical immobility, a proven risk factor for the development of venous thromboembolism (VTE).

This review compared interventions of subcutaneous fondaparinux and subcutaneous LMWHs, administered at a dose titrated according to body weight or a standard dose recommended by the country of interest. Studies were only included if the assessment was conducted up to 15 days post-surgery, aligning with the period cited to have an increased risk of VTE during the first two weeks.
