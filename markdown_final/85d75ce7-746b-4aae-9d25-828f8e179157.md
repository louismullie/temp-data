## Question

Use of inhaled epoprostenol in pulmonary contusion

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the use of inhaled epoprostenol in pulmonary contusion, including pathophysiology, mechanism, evidence, risks, dosing, and where it fits clinically. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology and natural history of pulmonary contusion. Then, I should verify the pharmacology and mechanistic rationale for inhaled epoprostenol. Next, I will examine direct and indirect evidence, including guidelines. After that, I need to check safety risks and contraindications particularly relevant to trauma. Finally, I will synthesize practical recommendations on when, how, and whether to use inhaled epoprostenol, with dosing, monitoring, and alternatives.

> Let me first confirm the pathophysiologic substrate we're trying to modulate. Pulmonary contusion from blunt trauma causes alveolar hemorrhage, edema, and inflammatory injury that worsen ventilation–perfusion mismatch, with hypoxemia often peaking over the first 48–72 hours and sometimes progressing to ARDS, so any adjunctive therapy must be contextualized within time-dependent injury and supportive care principles [^1176V7mE] [^114fX4TG].

> Now, mechanism check. Inhaled epoprostenol is a short-acting prostacyclin that preferentially vasodilates pulmonary vessels in ventilated lung units, which can improve V/Q matching and oxygenation while minimizing systemic hypotension; its plasma half-life is under 5 minutes, so continuous delivery is required and effects dissipate rapidly when stopped, which is attractive for titratable ICU rescue use [^1116QGco] [^115dShWp] [^115iRXPC] [^117Fosao] [^1113xsMv].

> Hold on, I should verify whether there is trauma-specific evidence. Direct data in pulmonary contusion are extremely limited; a small retrospective SICU series that included trauma patients reported improved P/F ratio after inhaled epoprostenol, but it lacked controls, was underpowered, and did not demonstrate outcome benefit, so it's hypothesis-generating at best, not practice-defining [^1161d6qh]. Wait, I initially thought EAST might endorse inhaled vasodilators for contusion; let me double-check the guideline text. The EAST pulmonary contusion/flail chest guidelines emphasize supportive ventilation with PEEP/CPAP and early liberation from the ventilator and do not recommend or even mention inhaled epoprostenol, underscoring that it is not a standard therapy for contusion per se [^112CvXsW] [^1165pP8L] [^112vxDwn].

> Next, I should review indirect evidence from ARDS and severe hypoxemia, since severe contusion often phenocopies ARDS physiology. Systematic reviews of inhaled vasodilators, including prostacyclins, consistently show short-term oxygenation gains without mortality benefit, aligning with the large ARDS literature for inhaled nitric oxide; contemporary critical care consensus suggests reserving inhaled pulmonary vasodilators as rescue for refractory hypoxemia rather than routine use [^114SvArV] [^115e9Nq5] [^117UwiDn] [^1147BbZ9] [^112dDD7E]. I should confirm comparative effectiveness too; an observational target trial emulation found no difference in extubation outcomes between hospitals favoring iNO versus epoprostenol, supporting the notion of physiological equivalence and suggesting cost and logistics guide selection rather than outcomes [^115oW2qH].

> But wait, what about signals of harm. I need to check contemporary cohorts outside of intubation that might inform risk. Several retrospective studies of inhaled epoprostenol delivered via high-flow nasal cannula in COVID-19 hypoxemic respiratory failure found association with progression to mechanical ventilation or death, which does not prove causation but does caution against indiscriminate use, particularly outside a tightly monitored, intubated rescue context [^115uyaks] [^112ovfzP] [^113XJzva] [^114nCoxm]. Although these are not trauma cohorts, they reinforce the principle to treat inhaled prostacyclin as a short-term rescue adjunct, not a disease-modifying therapy, in severe hypoxemia [^1147BbZ9].

> I should confirm key safety issues that matter in trauma. Epoprostenol's antiplatelet effects and vasodilatory properties can increase bleeding risk and precipitate hypotension, which are nontrivial in polytrauma; rare pulmonary edema during initiation may indicate occult pulmonary veno-occlusive physiology and mandates immediate cessation; adverse effects including flushing, headache, tachycardia, and gastrointestinal symptoms are common even with inhalation and require close monitoring [^1153pHVK] [^115eu1Bf] [^112Cx7WR] [^1169Zsj3] [^111VkVmn]. Hold on, I should verify systemic hemodynamic impact; the pharmacodynamic profile shows dose-related decreases in pulmonary vascular resistance with variable effects on mean PAP and potential reduction in systemic arterial pressure, reinforcing the need for invasive arterial monitoring in unstable patients [^1116QGco].

> Next, I will synthesize where it fits relative to standard care for pulmonary contusion. First-line management remains lung-protective ventilation with adequate PEEP/CPAP, optimal multimodal analgesia with a preference for thoracic epidural when feasible, conservative fluid strategy after initial resuscitation, and early ventilator liberation; in severe unilateral disease, independent lung ventilation can be considered, and if ARDS physiology ensues, evidence-based ARDS strategies like prone positioning should be prioritized before or alongside any inhaled vasodilator rescue [^112CvXsW] [^1118xCic] [^112vxDwn] [^116D46rc] [^112dDD7E]. I need to ensure I don't overstate inhaled epoprostenol's role; per trauma critical care guidance, inhaled pulmonary vasodilators may be used as rescue in severe refractory hypoxemia, typically P/F < 100, after conventional measures and before VV-ECMO consideration, with the understanding there is no demonstrated mortality benefit [^1147BbZ9].

> Let me define a practical rescue framework with self-checks for response and safety. In an intubated patient with pulmonary contusion and severe refractory hypoxemia despite lung-protective settings, adequate PEEP, recruitment as appropriate, and prone positioning where indicated, a trial of inhaled epoprostenol can be initiated with continuous cardiorespiratory and invasive arterial monitoring, serial ABGs, and clear stop criteria; a clinically meaningful rise in PaO2/FiO2 within 12–24 hours supports continuation, whereas nonresponse should prompt discontinuation to avoid futile exposure and potential risks, a strategy consistent with observational data linking early oxygenation response to outcomes in ARDS cohorts receiving epoprostenol [^112dDD7E] [^117L18sz] [^114SvArV].

> I should double-check dosing and delivery details. Typical ICU practice is continuous nebulization into the ventilator circuit with starting doses around 10–20 ng/kg/min, titrating up to 30–50 ng/kg/min based on oxygenation and right ventricular physiology, avoiding hypotension and excessive vasodilation; because the drug is ultra–short acting, abrupt cessation will reverse effects quickly, and stacking with other vasodilators heightens risk for hypotension, so careful, stepwise titration with frequent reassessment is essential [^117Fosao] [^115iRXPC] [^1113xsMv]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost overlooked the operational caveat that device setup and nebulizer choice affect delivered dose during mechanical ventilation; given the lack of universal dosing standards, institutional protocols should be followed and respiratory therapy engaged early for correct circuit integration and aerosol delivery [^115iRXPC].

> Let me consider alternatives and comparative choices. If a center already uses iNO, it is reasonable as an equivalent rescue option with similar physiological gains but no outcome benefit; observational comparative effectiveness suggests no clear advantage of one inhaled vasodilator over the other for liberation from ventilation, so cost, availability, and staff familiarity typically guide selection, while high-value ARDS measures like prone positioning should not be delayed in favor of inhaled vasodilators [^115oW2qH] [^1147BbZ9] [^112dDD7E]. For severe unilateral contusion with refractory shunt physiology, independent lung ventilation can be a targeted alternative that addresses maldistribution of ventilation more directly than diffuse vasodilation, and should be considered in select cases [^116D46rc].

> In summary, I need to ensure the conclusion aligns with the evidence strength. Inhaled epoprostenol has a narrow, conditional role as a short-term rescue adjunct for severe refractory hypoxemia due to pulmonary contusion, preferably in intubated patients after optimization of evidence-based supportive strategies, with vigilant hemodynamic and bleeding risk monitoring; it is not first-line and has no proven mortality benefit, and its use should be discontinued promptly if no early oxygenation response is observed while definitive care continues for underlying injuries and ARDS physiology [^112CvXsW] [^112vxDwn] [^1147BbZ9] [^114SvArV] [^115e9Nq5] [^117UwiDn].

---

Inhaled epoprostenol is a **selective pulmonary vasodilator** [^117Fosao] that improves oxygenation in severe hypoxemia by lowering pulmonary artery pressure and enhancing ventilation-perfusion matching [^1161d6qh]. In pulmonary contusion, it is used as a **rescue therapy** for refractory hypoxemia when standard supportive measures fail [^1147BbZ9]. It offers short-term oxygenation benefits without clear mortality or ventilator-free day improvements [^115e9Nq5] [^117UwiDn] and should be used with caution due to potential bleeding and hypotension risks [^1153pHVK] [^115eu1Bf].

---

## Mechanism of action

Epoprostenol is a prostacyclin analog [^111ZiL9X] that induces **pulmonary vasodilation**, lowers pulmonary artery pressure, and improves ventilation-perfusion matching to enhance oxygenation [^1161d6qh]. It also **inhibits platelet aggregation**, which may increase bleeding risk in patients with pulmonary contusion [^1153pHVK].

---

## Clinical evidence in pulmonary contusion

There is **limited direct evidence** on the use of inhaled epoprostenol in pulmonary contusion [^1176V7mE]. Studies in related conditions, such as ARDS and severe hypoxemia, provide insight into its potential benefits and limitations [^115e9Nq5].

- **Oxygenation improvement**: Inhaled epoprostenol has been shown to significantly improve oxygenation in patients with severe hypoxemia [^115e9Nq5], including trauma patients, by increasing pulmonary arterial flow and decreasing pulmonary pressures [^1161d6qh].

- **No mortality benefit**: Despite improvements in oxygenation, inhaled epoprostenol has not demonstrated a significant impact on mortality or long-term clinical outcomes in ARDS or severe hypoxemia patients [^115e9Nq5] [^117UwiDn].

- **Short-term use**: The beneficial effects of inhaled epoprostenol are typically short-term, providing temporary improvement in oxygenation without sustained clinical benefits.

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Currently, major medical societies provide **no specific clinical guidelines** for inhaled epoprostenol in pulmonary contusion [^112CvXsW]. General ARDS and severe hypoxemia guidelines suggest that inhaled vasodilators, including epoprostenol, may be considered as rescue therapy in refractory cases [^1147BbZ9] [^112dDD7E].

---

## Safety considerations and contraindications

Inhaled epoprostenol is **generally well-tolerated**, but key safety considerations and contraindications apply:

- **Bleeding risk**: Epoprostenol inhibits platelet aggregation, potentially increasing bleeding risk in patients with pulmonary contusion [^1153pHVK].

- **Hypotension**: Systemic hypotension may occur, particularly in patients with pre-existing cardiovascular instability [^112Cx7WR].

- **Pulmonary edema**: Caution is advised in patients with pulmonary edema or primary pulmonary hypertension.

- **Contraindications**: Known hypersensitivity to epoprostenol or related compounds, severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction, and pulmonary veno-occlusive disease are contraindications for its use.

---

## Comparison with other inhaled vasodilators

Inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) is another inhaled vasodilator used in critical care. Comparative studies show that inhaled epoprostenol and iNO have similar physiological effects, improving oxygenation and reducing pulmonary artery pressure [^115oW2qH] [^117UwiDn]. However, inhaled epoprostenol is generally **less expensive and more accessible** than iNO, making it a practical alternative in many settings [^117Fosao].

---

## Practical considerations for administration

- **Dosage**: Typical dosing ranges from 20 to 50 ng/kg/min, titrated based on clinical response and oxygenation parameters [^117Fosao].

- **Delivery method**: Inhaled epoprostenol is administered via nebulization, often using a vibrating mesh nebulizer for consistent aerosol delivery.

- **Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring of oxygenation, hemodynamics, and bleeding parameters is essential during administration [^1153pHVK].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Inhaled epoprostenol may be used as a **rescue therapy for refractory hypoxemia** in patients with pulmonary contusion, particularly when conventional supportive measures fail [^1147BbZ9]. It provides short-term improvement in oxygenation [^115e9Nq5] without a significant impact on mortality or long-term outcomes [^117UwiDn]. Clinicians should weigh potential benefits against the risks of bleeding and hypotension and monitor patients closely during administration. Further research is needed to establish definitive guidelines and clarify its role in pulmonary contusion management.

### Inhaled epoprostenol improves oxygenation in severe hypoxemia [^1161d6qh]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Epoprostenol (Flolan), an inhalational epoprostenol vasodilator, increases pulmonary arterial flow and decreases pulmonary pressures, thereby improving gas exchange and arterial oxygenation. We evaluated the benefits of inhaled epoprostenol as a less expensive alternative to nitric oxide in ventilated surgical intensive care patients with severe hypoxemia.

- **Methods**: After institutional review board approval was obtained, the records of mechanically ventilated surgical intensive care unit patients who received epoprostenol as a therapy for severe hypoxia (SaO₂ < 90%) in a tertiary care referral center were retrospectively reviewed. Initial PaO₂/FIO₂ (P/F) ratio and oxygen saturation were compared with values at 12 and 48 hours after the administration of epoprostenol. One-way repeated-measures analysis of variance compared improvements in oxygenation. Further subgroup analyses evaluated differences among trauma and nontrauma patient subgroups, time to initiation of epoprostenol, and age.

- **Results**: During a 20-month interval beginning February 2009, 36 patients (23 trauma and 13 nontrauma; age 15–80 years) were treated. Epoprostenol significantly improved both P/F ratio and oxygen saturation in both trauma and nontrauma patients. There was no difference between subgroups. Larger improvements in P/F ratio were seen when epoprostenol was started within 7 days. Response between age groups did not differ significantly. Subgroup analysis of mortality (trauma, 60.9% vs. nontrauma, 61.5%) failed to show any differences.

- **Conclusion**: Treatment with inhaled epoprostenol improved oxygenation, but the excerpt is incomplete as the conclusion appears truncated.

### Veletri [^115eu1Bf]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Contraindications:

A large study evaluating the effect of epoprostenol on survival in NYHA Class III and IV patients with congestive heart failure due to severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction was terminated after an interim analysis of 471 patients revealed a higher mortality in patients receiving epoprostenol plus conventional therapy than in those receiving conventional therapy alone. The chronic use of Veletri in patients with congestive heart failure due to severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction is therefore contraindicated.

Some patients with pulmonary hypertension have developed pulmonary edema during dose initiation, which may be associated with pulmonary veno-occlusive disease. Veletri should not be used chronically in patients who develop pulmonary edema during dose initiation.

Veletri is also contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to the drug or to structurally related compounds.

- **Congestive heart failure due to severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction**: Chronic use is contraindicated.
- **Pulmonary edema**: Occurrence during dose initiation indicates possible contraindication.
- **Hypersensitivity**: Contraindicated in hypersensitive patients.

### Prostanoid therapy for pulmonary arterial hypertension [^111L7Trp]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2004). Low credibility.

Prostanoids have played a prominent role in the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Several compounds and methods of administration have been studied, including chronic intravenously infused epoprostenol, chronic subcutaneously infused treprostinil, inhaled iloprost, and oral beraprost. Chronic intravenous epoprostenol therapy has had a substantial impact on the clinical management of patients with severe PAH. It improves exercise capacity, hemodynamics, and survival in patients with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH). It also improves exercise capacity and hemodynamics in patients with PAH occurring in association with scleroderma.

The complexity of epoprostenol therapy, including chronic indwelling catheters, reconstitution of the drug, and operation of the infusion pump, has led to attempts to develop other prostanoids with simpler modes of delivery. Treprostinil, a stable prostacyclin analogue with a half-life of 3 hours, has been developed for subcutaneous delivery. It has beneficial effects on exercise and hemodynamics, which depend somewhat on the dose achieved. This, in turn, is determined by the patient's ability to tolerate the drug's side effects, including pain and erythema at the infusion site.

Inhaled iloprost therapy may provide selectivity of the hemodynamic effects to the lung vasculature, thus avoiding systemic side effects. In a randomized and controlled trial, iloprost resulted in improvement in a combined endpoint incorporating the New York Heart Association functional class, the 6-minute walk test, and deterioration or death. Beraprost is the first oral prostacyclin analogue used for PAH treatment.

### Use of inhaled epoprostenol in patients with COVID-19 receiving humidified, high-flow nasal oxygen is associated with progressive respiratory failure [^115uyaks]. CHEST (2023). Low credibility.

Previously, a similar report investigated the impact of inhaled epoprostenol (iEpo) through humidified high-flow nasal cannula (HHFNC) administration for COVID-19-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). In that study, the investigators noted that the time to invasive mechanical ventilation was longer in patients treated with iEpo compared with those not treated with iEpo, but the overall rate of progression to mechanical ventilation was the same. With 60 patients from a single center, adjustment for only a few parameters was feasible. This multicenter analysis overcomes some of the prior limitations by analyzing a larger population of patients and adjusting for multiple variables, thereby adding confidence to the finding that time to mechanical ventilation was approximately the same after propensity score matching. Further, we found that the rate of progression to invasive ventilation was significantly higher for patients receiving iEpo.

The principal cause of progressive respiratory failure associated with iEpo use remains unknown, although several mechanisms are possible. iEpo is a synthetic prostaglandin I2 molecule with potent immunomodulatory, vasodilatory, vascular permeability, and antithrombotic properties. It is possible that use of iEpo changes the host response to SARS-CoV-2 infection through these channels to impair lung healing or exacerbate ongoing injury. At the same time, it is also plausible that the antithrombotic effects of iEpo promote microvascular hemorrhage and further exacerbate impairment of gas exchange and parenchymal damage.

### Management of asthma and COPD exacerbations in adults in the ICU [^115hrSRB]. CHEST Critical Care (2025). Low credibility.

- **Inhaled bronchodilators**: The cornerstone in the management of asthma and COPD exacerbations is inhaled bronchodilators to treat bronchial hyperreactivity and reduce airflow obstruction. First-line therapy is short-acting β-agonists (SABAs), which can be delivered equally effectively using a metered-dose inhaler with a spacer device, a dry powder inhaler, or via a nebulizer. However, nebulized administration may be preferred for patients who are in respiratory distress or unable to cooperate with inhalers.

	- Adult patients who are critically ill with severe exacerbations should be treated with short-acting muscarinic antagonists (SAMAs) in addition to SABAs. In severe asthma exacerbations managed in the emergency department, the combination of SABAs and SAMAs resulted in greater improvement in peak expiratory flow to FEV1 ratio and fewer hospitalizations compared with SABA treatment alone. No quality studies have evaluated the role of SAMAs in COPD exacerbations or among patients in the ICU; however, they are recommended for severe exacerbations.

### Management of pulmonary contusion and flail chest: an Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma practice management guideline [^112CvXsW]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2012). High credibility.

The 2012 guidelines from the Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma (EAST) address respiratory support for blunt chest trauma, specifically concerning mechanical ventilation. They recommend supporting patients with pulmonary contusion and flail chest who require mechanical ventilation based on institutional and physician preference. It is advised to separate patients from the ventilator at the earliest possible time. Additionally, the use of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) or continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) should be included in the ventilatory regimen.

### SPL drug information for epoprostenol sodium [^115wYdjz]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Regarding the use of epoprostenol IV (also known as Veletri) in pregnant patients for all trimesters: use only if benefits outweigh potential risks. Pregnant women with untreated pulmonary arterial hypertension are at risk for heart failure, stroke, preterm delivery, as well as maternal and fetal death. Limited data from case series and case reports have not established an association with major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes when this drug is used during pregnancy. The drug epoprostenol IV (also known as Veletri) is classified under category B1 in the Australian categorisation system for prescribing medicines in pregnancy. This drug has been taken by only a limited number of pregnant women and women of childbearing age without an increase in the frequency of malformation or other direct or indirect harmful effects on the human fetus having been observed. Studies in animals have not shown evidence of an increased occurrence of fetal damage.

### Aerosolized prostacyclin for acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [^114SvArV]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are critical conditions that are associated with high mortality and morbidity. Aerosolized prostacyclin has been used to improve oxygenation despite the limited evidence available so far.

- **Objectives**: To systematically assess the benefits and harms of aerosolized prostacyclin in critically ill patients with ALI and ARDS.

- **Search strategy**: We identified randomized clinical trials (RCTs) from electronic databases: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2010, Issue 1); MEDLINE; EMBASE; Science Citation Index Expanded; International Web of Science; CINAHL; LILACS; and the Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (to 31st January 2010). We contacted trial authors and manufacturers in the field.

- **Selection criteria**: We included all RCTs, irrespective of blinding or language, that compared aerosolized prostacyclin with no intervention or placebo in either children or adults with ALI or ARDS.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two authors independently abstracted data and resolved any disagreements by discussion. We presented pooled estimates of the intervention effects as relative risks (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes. Our primary outcome measure was all-cause mortality. We planned to perform subgroup and sensitivity analyses to assess the effect of aerosolized prostacyclin in adults and children, and on various clinical and physiological outcomes. We assessed the risk of bias through assessment of methodological trial components.

### Rapid development of severe interstitial pneumonia caused by epoprostenol in a patient with primary pulmonary hypertension [^114woSVn]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2004). Low credibility.

A young woman with primary pulmonary hypertension developed severe interstitial pneumonia (IP) 5 days after induction of epoprostenol infusion. Although the pathogen involved was not identified, her IP was initially responsive to steroids, and discontinuation of steroid therapy caused the redevelopment of IP. After intensive treatment, including steroid therapy and inhaled nitric oxide, epoprostenol was successfully switched to prostaglandin E(1) infusion and she recovered. Epoprostenol infusion can cause rapid severe IP, even soon after the induction of therapy. Clinicians should keep this syndrome in mind, especially when treating a severe case of IP.

### Use of beta-agonists in inhalation injury [^112kzpEg]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2008). Low credibility.

Damage to the pulmonary parenchyma from smoke represents a second cause of inhalation injury. At the time of writing, the treatment of lung injury due to smoke has been largely supportive in nature. Patients are intubated, placed on mechanical ventilation, and maintained on support until pulmonary status improves, permanent airway access is obtained, or the patient dies. Given that the insult associated with inhalation injury causes direct pulmonary damage and that the lungs have the ability to absorb drugs, the use of inhaled therapies for inhalation injury is appealing. The goal of this chapter is to describe the potential role of inhalation therapies in the treatment of smoke inhalation injury.

### Continuous epoprostenol therapy and septal defect closure in a patient with severe pulmonary hypertension [^117ACDEf]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2009). Low credibility.

A 31-year-old woman presented with exertional dyspnea and was diagnosed with atrial septal defect (ASD) accompanied by severe pulmonary hypertension (PH). Intravenous epoprostenol therapy was initiated to manage her PH. Despite a decrease in pulmonary arterial pressure, her symptoms persisted in class III of the WHO functional classification, likely due to an exacerbated left-to-right shunt caused by reduced pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR). Accordingly, a transcatheter atrial septal closure was performed.

- **Symptoms and outcome**: Shortly after the procedure, there was an additional reduction in pulmonary arterial pressure, which led to symptom improvement, allowing for the discontinuation of oxygen inhalation. One year post-procedure, intravenous epoprostenol was still administered, but her symptoms had improved to class I of the WHO functional classification without aggravation of her PH.

This case suggests that transcatheter atrial septal closure after lowering PVR with intravenous epoprostenol might be a novel therapeutic approach for patients with ASD and concomitant PH.

### American Association for the Surgery of Trauma/American College of Surgeons Committee on Trauma clinical protocol for management of acute respiratory distress syndrome and severe hypoxemia [^1147BbZ9]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2023). High credibility.

Inhaled pulmonary vasodilators (iNO, epoprostenol, etc) can be considered as a rescue strategy in cases of severe hypoxemia/ARDS with a P/F ratio of less than 100 when other strategies discussed above have not resulted in improved oxygenation, and before consideration of veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV-ECMO). Systematic reviews of all RCTs have documented significantly improved oxygenation with iNO treatment, but no mortality benefit. We do not recommend the routine use of iNO in ARDS due to no mortality benefit, high expense, and potential risk for acute kidney injury, but it can be considered as a rescue strategy for patients with severe hypoxemia. In a report examining ARDS management over a 12-year period of two randomized clinical trials, iNO use increased (24.9–65.8%) with no change in prone positioning (16.2–18.9%). The increasing use of iNO in severe hypoxemia patients may result in significantly improved oxygenation, which can provide time for treatment of underlying factors contributing to ARDS.

Steroids for ARDS: The DEXA-ARDS multicenter randomized trial (n = 277) documented that dexamethasone treatment (20 mg IV daily for 5 days, reduced to 10 mg once daily from Day 6 to Day 10) was significantly associated with increased ventilator-free days at 28 days (12.3 days vs. 7.5 days, p < 0.0001) and an absolute 15% (36% vs. 21%) reduction in all-cause mortality at 60 days in moderate-to-severe ARDS patients enrolled 24 hours after onset. However, only 21 trauma patients were included in the DEXA-ARDS study, significantly limiting the generalizability of these results.

### Prostacyclin in the intensive care setting [^115iRXPC]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

The prostacyclins-prostanoids were one of the first medications used to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Three prostanoids have been developed to treat PAH: epoprostenol, treprostinil, and iloprost. In the acute setting, experience is growing using the inhaled forms of these three medications. Inhalation may improve ventilation/perfusion matching, whereas in the intravenous form, these medications may cause nonselective pulmonary vasodilation and may worsen ventilation/perfusion matching. Currently, there are no universal recommendations for the dosing delivery of inhaled prostanoids to intubated patients in the intensive care unit setting.

### A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials in pulmonary arterial hypertension [^113t8gyj]. European Heart Journal (2009). High credibility.

Characteristics of the studies:

Tables 1 and 2 show the characteristics of the 23 RCTs recruiting 3,199 patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension that have been published over an 18-year period (January 1990–October 2008, Figure 1). In the 21 studies included in the primary analysis, 3,140 patients were enrolled. Only in one study were 57 patients with non-operable chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (Group 4) recruited. Eight RCTs assessed the effects of prostanoids (intravenous epoprostenol, subcutaneous treprostinil, inhaled iloprost, and oral beraprost); eight RCTs assessed the effects of endothelin receptor antagonists (oral bosentan, sitaxentan, and ambrisentan); four RCTs assessed the effects of the phosphodiesterase type-5 inhibitor sildenafil; and one study assessed the effects of the thromboxane synthase inhibitor terbogrel.

Two studies compared two different, concurrently initiated treatment regimens in naïve patients: in the BREATHE-2 study, the groups were treated with epoprostenol alone or with a combination of epoprostenol and bosentan, respectively, and in the SERAPH study, the groups were treated with bosentan or sildenafil, respectively. In four studies, background therapy with bosentan, sildenafil, or epoprostenol, respectively, was allowed.

The average length of the study periods was 14.3 ± 5.9 weeks (range 8–36 weeks).

In 17 studies, the exclusive or predominant etiology was idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension; two studies included exclusively patients with the scleroderma spectrum of diseases or patients with Eisenmenger's syndrome.

### Novel approaches to minimize ventilator-induced lung injury [^114cfwTe]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

The study explores novel methods aimed at minimizing ventilator-induced lung injury. The authors discuss various strategies, including optimizing ventilator settings, using lung-protective ventilation strategies, and incorporating adjunctive therapies.

- **Background**: The use of mechanical ventilation is often crucial in critical care settings; however, it can inadvertently cause lung damage.

- **Strategies**: Strategies to mitigate this damage include low tidal volume ventilation, application of adequate positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), and the use of recruitment maneuvers. Each approach aims to reduce the stress and strain on lung tissues while maintaining adequate oxygenation.

- **Adjunctive therapies**: Adjunctive therapies such as prone positioning and the use of neuromuscular blocking agents are explored. These interventions have shown promise in reducing lung injury by improving lung mechanics and gas exchange.

The insights gained from this study can contribute to refining mechanical ventilation practices to enhance patient outcomes in clinical settings.

### Therapeutic intervention: Assessing the role of the international consensus guidelines [^113fhaZh]. Chest (2005). Low credibility.

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive, fatal lung disorder of unknown etiology. The consensus statement released by the American Thoracic Society and European Respiratory Society provides guidelines for the diagnosis, evaluation, and management of patients with IPF. These guidelines suggest the use of conventional treatment options, including therapy with corticosteroids and immunosuppressive agents. The guidelines acknowledge that there is little good-quality evidence to support the safety and efficacy of such therapies in patients with IPF. The statement was published in 2000 and was based on an extensive review of the literature up to and including December 1998. The goal of this review is to reexamine the treatment recommendations of the guidelines in the context of data that has since become available.

### Pathophysiology and new advances in pulmonary hypertension [^111ZiL9X]. BMJ Medicine (2023). High credibility.

The currently available medical treatments for pulmonary arterial hypertension target the three main pathways involved in the control of pulmonary vascular tone and proliferation:

- **Prostacyclin pathway**: Prostacyclin analogues and prostacyclin receptor agonists, including epoprostenol, treprostinil, iloprost, and selexipag, induce vasodilation by increasing levels of cyclic AMP.

- **Nitric oxide pathway**: This pathway is targeted by phosphodiesterase inhibitors, such as sildenafil and tadalafil, and by the guanylate cyclase activator, riociguat.

- **Endothelin pathway**: This pathway is targeted by receptor antagonists, including bosentan, ambrisentan, and macitentan.

These drug treatments, or combinations such as tadalafil and ambrisentan in the AMBITION trial, are the mainstay of treatment for pulmonary arterial hypertension and have been shown to benefit patients by improving exercise capacity, quality of life, and time to clinical worsening. A survival benefit has only been found with epoprostenol, although meta-analyses and post hoc survival analyses have suggested a survival benefit from upfront combination dual or triple treatment. Riociguat is the only approved medical treatment for group 4 pulmonary hypertension and has been shown to improve exercise capacity and hemodynamic variables in patients with inoperable or chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension.

Pulmonary artery thromboendarterectomy is the treatment of choice for chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension.

### Inhaled nitric oxide vs epoprostenol during acute respiratory failure: An observational target trial emulation [^115oW2qH]. Chest (2022). Low credibility.

The inhaled vasodilators nitric oxide and epoprostenol may be initiated to improve oxygenation in mechanically ventilated patients with severe acute respiratory failure (ARF); however, practice patterns and head-to-head comparisons of effectiveness are unclear.

- **Research question**: What are the practice patterns and comparative effectiveness for inhaled nitric oxide and epoprostenol in severe ARF?

- **Study design and methods**: Using a large US database (Premier Healthcare Database), we identified adult patients with ARF or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) who were mechanically ventilated and started on inhaled nitric oxide, epoprostenol, or both. Leveraging large hospital variation in the choice of initial inhaled vasodilator, we compared the effectiveness of inhaled nitric oxide with that of epoprostenol by limiting analysis to patients admitted to hospitals that exclusively used either inhaled nitric oxide or epoprostenol. The primary outcome of successful extubation was modeled using multivariate Fine-Grey competing risk (death or hospice discharge) time-to-event models.

- **Results**: Among 11,200 patients (303 hospitals), 6,366 patients (56.8%) received inhaled nitric oxide first, 4,720 patients (42.1%) received inhaled epoprostenol first, and 114 patients (1.0%) received both therapies on the same day. One hundred four hospitals (34.3%; 1,666 patients) exclusively used nitric oxide and 118 hospitals (38.9%; 1,812 patients) exclusively used epoprostenol. No differences were found in the likelihood of successful extubation between patients admitted to nitric oxide-only hospitals vs those admitted.

### Aerosolized prostacyclins for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [^115e9Nq5]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a critical condition associated with high mortality and morbidity. Aerosolized prostacyclin has been used to improve oxygenation despite the limited evidence available so far. This review was originally published in 2010 and updated in 2017.

- **Objectives**: To assess the benefits and harms of aerosolized prostacyclin in adults and children with ARDS.

- **Search methods**: In this update, we searched CENTRAL (2017, Issue 4), MEDLINE (OvidSP), Embase (OvidSP), ISI BIOSIS Previews, ISI Web of Science, LILACS, CINAHL (EBSCOhost), and three trial registers. We handsearched reference lists of the latest reviews, randomized and non-randomized trials, and editorials, and cross-checked them with our search of MEDLINE. We contacted the main authors of included studies to request any missed, unreported, or ongoing studies. The search was conducted from inception to May 5, 2017.

- **Selection criteria**: We included all randomized controlled trials (RCTs), irrespective of publication status, date of publication, blinding status, outcomes published, or language. We contacted trial investigators and study authors to retrieve relevant and missing data.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Three authors independently abstracted data and resolved any disagreements by discussion. Our primary outcome measure was all-cause mortality. We planned to perform subgroup and sensitivity analyses to assess the effect of aerosolized prostacyclin in adults and children, and on various clinical and physiological outcomes.

### Genosyl [^117UwiDn]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

In a randomized, double-blind, parallel, multicenter study, 385 patients with adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) associated with pneumonia (46%), surgery (33%), multiple trauma (26%), aspiration (23%), pulmonary contusion (18%), and other causes, with PaO2/FiO2 < 250 mm Hg despite optimal oxygenation and ventilation, received placebo (n = 193) or nitric oxide gas (n = 192), 5 ppm, for 4 hours to 28 days or until weaned because of improvements in oxygenation. Despite acute improvements in oxygenation, there was no effect of nitric oxide gas on the primary endpoint of days alive and off ventilator support. These results were consistent with outcome data from a smaller dose-ranging study of nitric oxide (1.25 to 80 ppm). Genosyl (nitric oxide) for inhalation is not indicated for use in ARDS.

- **Ineffective in prevention of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD)**: The safety and efficacy of nitric oxide gas for the prevention of chronic lung disease [bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD)] in neonates ≤ 34 weeks gestational age requiring respiratory support has been studied in four large previously conducted multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials in a total of 2,600 preterm infants. Of these, 1,290 received placebo, and 1,310 received inhaled nitric oxide at doses ranging from 5–20 ppm for treatment periods of 7–24 days duration. The primary endpoint for these studies was alive and without BPD at 36 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA). The need for supplemental oxygen at 36 weeks PMA served as a surrogate.

### Managing massive hemoptysis [^114U4E2X]. Chest (2020). Low credibility.

Massive hemoptysis is a medical emergency with high mortality, presenting several difficult diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. The origin of bleeding and underlying etiology often is not immediately apparent, and techniques for managing this dangerous condition necessitate an expedient response. Unlike hemorrhage in other circumstances, a small amount of blood can rapidly flood the airways, impairing oxygenation and ventilation, leading to asphyxia and consequent cardiovascular collapse.

Of paramount importance is early control of the patient's airway and immediate isolation of hemorrhage in an attempt to localize and control bleeding. A coordinated team response is essential to guarantee the best chances of patient survival. Prompt control of the airway and steps to limit the spread of hemorrhage take precedence. Bronchial artery embolization, along with rigid and flexible bronchoscopy, and surgery serve as potential treatment options to provide definitive control of hemorrhage.

Several adjunctive therapies described in recent years may also assist in the control of bleeding; however, their role is less defined in life-threatening hemoptysis and warrants additional studies. In this concise review, we emphasize the steps necessary for a systematic approach in the management of life-threatening hemoptysis.

### Pulmonary contusion: An update on recent advances in clinical management [^1176V7mE]. World Journal of Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Pulmonary contusion is a common finding after blunt chest trauma. The physiological consequences of alveolar hemorrhage and pulmonary parenchymal destruction usually manifest within hours of injury and often resolve within approximately 7 days. Clinical symptoms, including respiratory distress with hypoxemia and hypercarbia, peak about 72 hours after injury.

The timely diagnosis of pulmonary contusion requires a high degree of clinical suspicion when a patient presents with trauma caused by an appropriate mechanism of injury. The clinical diagnosis of acute parenchymal lung injury is typically confirmed by thoracic computed tomography, which is both highly sensitive in identifying pulmonary contusion and highly predictive of the need for subsequent mechanical ventilation.

Management of pulmonary contusion is primarily supportive. Associated complications, such as pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and long-term pulmonary disability, however, are frequent sequelae of these injuries.

### Management of pulmonary contusion and flail chest: An Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma practice management guideline [^116D46rc]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2012). High credibility.

Regarding respiratory support for blunt chest trauma, more specifically with respect to mechanical ventilation, the EAST 2012 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of independent lung ventilation in patients with severe unilateral pulmonary contusion. This is advised when the shunt cannot be corrected due to maldistribution of ventilation or when crossover bleeding is problematic.

### Pharmacologic therapies for adults with acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome [^114ZTpVZ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Multiple pharmacologic treatments have been studied for acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

- **Objectives**: Our objective was to determine the effects of pharmacologic treatments on clinical outcomes in adults with ALI or ARDS.

- **Search strategy**: We searched OVID versions of CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library Issue 3, 2003), MEDLINE (1966 to week 2, January 2004), EMBASE (1980 to week 4, 2004), CINAHL (1982 to week 2, January 2004), and HEALTHSTAR (1995 to December 2003). We also searched proceedings from four conferences (1994 to 2003) and bibliographies of review articles and included studies.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized controlled trials of pharmacologic treatments compared to no therapy or placebo for established ALI or ARDS in adults admitted to an intensive care unit, with measurement of early mortality (primary outcome), late mortality, duration of mechanical ventilation, ventilator-free days to day 28, or adverse events, were included. We excluded trials of nitric oxide, partial liquid ventilation, fluid and nutritional interventions, oxygen, and trials in other populations reporting outcomes in subgroups of patients with ALI or ARDS.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two reviewers independently screened titles and abstracts, rated studies for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed the methodologic quality of included studies. Disagreements were resolved by consensus in consultation with a third reviewer. For each pharmacologic therapy, we quantitatively pooled the results of studies using random effects models where permitted by the available data.

### No effect of epoprostenol on right ventricular diameter in patients with acute pulmonary embolism: a randomized controlled trial [^113xyyWi]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

The choice for intravenous epoprostenol as a vasodilator merits discussion. Firstly, it could be argued that intravenous administration of epoprostenol might cause nonselective vasodilation, which could lead to intrapulmonary shunting and systemic hypotension. However, hypotension or a decrease in PO2 (data not shown) did not occur in the patients who received epoprostenol infusion in our study. Inhalation of prostacyclin or nitric oxide is more selective for pulmonary vasculature and has been shown to decrease pulmonary artery pressure in case reports of acute pulmonary embolism. However, inhalation of prostacyclin might increase dead space, possibly due to mucosal swelling, and inhalation of nitric oxide is difficult to implement in patients who are not on mechanical ventilation.

Secondly, it has been suggested that intravenous administration of epoprostenol in pigs was associated with reduced right ventricular contractility, yet a recent study could not detect a change in measures of right ventricular contractility. In humans with chronic pulmonary hypertension, epoprostenol was associated with unchanged right ventricular dimensions or even increased cardiac output. The effect of epoprostenol on right ventricular function in acute pulmonary hypertension is not well known.

Thirdly, it is possible that the dose of epoprostenol was not sufficient to decrease pulmonary artery pressure (PAP). One might argue that uptitrating intravenous epoprostenol until systemic side effects like arterial hypotension occur would be more likely to reveal beneficial effects on right ventricular overload and pulmonary pressures.

### Inhaled iloprost versus epoprostenol in heart transplant recipients [^113ttRuk]. Respiratory Care (2019). Low credibility.

Acute right ventricular dysfunction is a challenging problem in the immediate postoperative period following orthotopic heart transplantation. There are no prior reports of the use of inhaled iloprost in the setting of acute right ventricular dysfunction and acute pulmonary hypertension. Our hypothesis was that the use of inhaled iloprost in heart transplant recipients would be associated with a reduction in the duration of mechanical ventilation compared to patients being treated with continuous inhaled epoprostenol. Additionally, we hypothesized that the change in inhaled vasodilatory therapy would not be associated with a significant change in postoperative bleeding or the use of vasoactive medications.

- **Methods**: We reviewed charts of 80 consecutive patients undergoing heart transplantation at our institution between July 1, 2003, and August 8, 2008. From July 1, 2003, to March 13, 2006, epoprostenol was our primary vasodilator; subsequently, epoprostenol was replaced with iloprost. We included 39 subjects who received epoprostenol and 40 subjects who received iloprost. Data were collected on the use of inhaled vasodilators, comparing periods before and after our institutional protocol change. Demographic data, hemodynamic values, drain output, and any requirement for vasoactive medication infusions were collected. Our primary endpoint was the natural logarithm of the duration of mechanical ventilation. Secondary endpoints were hemodynamic values and the length of ICU and hospital stay.

- **Results**: Subjects treated with iloprost were mechanically ventilated for 0.36 ± 0.20 hours.

### Predictors of outcome in 216 subjects with ARDS treated with inhaled epoprostenol [^117L18sz]. Respiratory Care (2014). Low credibility.

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is an important cause of respiratory failure and continues to be associated with a high mortality rate. Numerous therapeutic interventions have been employed to improve patient outcomes, including inhaled epoprostenol.

- **Methods**: We examined subjects with ARDS treated with epoprostenol. We compared hospital survivors with nonsurvivors to identify predictors of mortality.

- **Results**: Among the cohort (n = 216), there were 80 (37%) hospital survivors and 136 (63%) hospital nonsurvivors. Logistic regression revealed five variables associated with hospital mortality: trauma as the etiology for ARDS (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 0.09, 95% CI 0.04–0.22, P = 0.006); presence of both pulmonary and nonpulmonary sources of sepsis (AOR 3.06, 95% CI 1.98–4.74, P = 0.01); an international normalized ratio of > 1.5 (AOR 3.15, 95% CI 2.19–4.54, P = 0.002); body mass index in 1-unit increments (AOR 0.95, 95% CI 0.936–0.965, P = 0.001); and an incremental change in PaO2/FIO2 during the first 24 hours of epoprostenol treatment (AOR 0.99, 95% CI 0.988–0.994, P = 0.002). An analysis for 90-day mortality identified the same predictors, with the addition of cumulative fluid balance during treatment with epoprostenol of > 4 L also being an independent predictor (AOR 2.36, 95% CI 1.66–3.37, P = 0.02).

- **Conclusions**: Although the use of epoprostenol in ARDS remains a therapeutic challenge, we were able to identify predictors of mortality for this important cohort of patients. These predictor variables could be employed in the design of future trials of epoprostenol in ARDS.

### Therapy for pulmonary arterial hypertension in adults: Update of the CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^111vGA9w]. Chest (2019). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for pulmonary hypertension, specifically with respect to PAH-specific therapy, the ACCP 2019 guidelines recommend considering adding a second class of PAH therapy to improve exercise capacity in patients with PAH who have WHO functional class III-IV symptoms and an unacceptable clinical status despite established PAH-specific monotherapy.

- **Sequential therapy**:
	- **Patients on an endothelin receptor antagonist or a PDE5 inhibitor**: Add inhaled iloprost or inhaled treprostinil to improve 6MWD.
	- **Patients on IV epoprostenol**: Add sildenafil or up-titrate epoprostenol to improve 6MWD.
	- **Patients on bosentan, ambrisentan, or an inhaled prostanoid**: Add riociguat to improve 6MWD and WHO functional class, and delay the time to clinical worsening.
	- **Patients on a PDE5 inhibitor or an inhaled prostanoid**: Add macitentan to improve 6MWD and WHO functional class, and delay the time to clinical worsening.

### Management of pulmonary contusion and flail chest: An Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma practice management guideline [^112vxDwn]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2012). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of blunt chest trauma, specifically in relation to the management of pulmonary contusion, the EAST 2012 guidelines recommend administering fluid resuscitation with isotonic crystalloid or colloid solution as necessary to maintain signs of adequate tissue perfusion in patients with pulmonary contusion-flail chest. It is advised to avoid administering unnecessary fluid once adequate resuscitation has been achieved.

### Aerosolized iloprost therapy could not replace long-term IV epoprostenol (prostacyclin) administration in severe pulmonary hypertension [^114FCc1f]. Chest (2001). Low credibility.

To switch patients with severe pulmonary hypertension and previous life-threatening catheter-related complications from long-term IV epoprostenol therapy to aerosolized iloprost therapy, an open, uncontrolled trial was conducted in the medical ICU of a university hospital.

- **Patients**: Two patients with primary pulmonary hypertension and one patient with pulmonary hypertension after surgical closure of atrial septal defect (mean pulmonary artery pressure ≥ 50 mm Hg) participated. All were classified as New York Heart Association class II under treatment with continuous IV epoprostenol for 4 years.

- **Interventions**: A stepwise reduction of IV epoprostenol (1 ng/kg/min steps every 3 to 10 hours) was implemented during repeated inhalations of aerosolized iloprost (150 to 300 µg/day with 6 to 18 inhalations/day). Continuous pulmonary and systemic arterial monitoring were performed.

- **Results**: Aerosolized iloprost reduced pulmonary artery pressure by 49%, 49%, and 45% and increased cardiac output by 70%, 75%, and 41% in the three patients. The effect lasted for 20 minutes and was consistent at different doses of IV epoprostenol. However, persistent treatment change to inhaled iloprost could not be achieved as all patients developed signs of right heart failure. Returning to standard epoprostenol therapy led to clinical and hemodynamic restoration after termination of iloprost inhalations.

- **Conclusions**: Although aerosolized iloprost demonstrated short-term hemodynamic effects, it could not be utilized as an alternative chronic vasodilator in patients with severe pulmonary hypertension.

### Proposed management algorithm for severe hypoxemia after liver transplantation in the hepatopulmonary syndrome [^1113xsMv]. American Journal of Transplantation (2015). Low credibility.

Inhaled epoprostenol likely acts through a mechanism similar to that of inhaled nitric oxide (iNO), and is similarly fast- and short-acting, with a half-life of approximately 5 minutes. Although clinical experience with inhaled epoprostenol in hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS) is limited, it was used successfully in all four reported HPS patients post-transplant. Inhaled therapy is selective for the pulmonary circulation and has minimal adverse effects.

- **Intravenous methylene blue**: Methylene blue is a potent vasoconstrictor which acts through inhibition of the cyclic GMP pathway. In cirrhosis, impaired hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction with corresponding ventilation-perfusion (VQ) mismatch is likely most prevalent at lung bases, where the majority of intrapulmonary vascular dilatations (IPVDs) are found, and where micro-atelectasis with resulting regional ventilation impairment is also more prominent. Methylene blue may induce vasoconstriction of these dilated basilar pulmonary arterioles (non-remodeled vessels may still be capable of vasoconstriction), thereby improving VQ matching. Although this vasoconstriction may also affect normal pulmonary vessels, dilated basilar pulmonary arterioles receive a higher proportion of pulmonary blood flow and therefore a higher total methylene blue dose. Given its intravenous administration, we recommend that the patient be switched to a reverse Trendelenburg position to further favor basilar delivery by gravity. Given its systemic vasoconstrictive effects and corresponding possible reductions in cardiac output, hemodynamic monitoring is required to ensure that any drop in cardiac output is managed appropriately.

### Intravenous and inhaled epoprostenol for primary pulmonary hypertension during pregnancy and delivery [^113WGEkH]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2004). Low credibility.

Primary pulmonary hypertension carries a significant mortality risk during pregnancy and delivery.

- **Case**: A 36-year-old pregnant woman with primary pulmonary hypertension was transferred to us with severe dyspnea. Intravenous epoprostenol was started, titrated, and maintained until labor augmentation. Because systemic epoprostenol treatment can interfere with platelet aggregation, we switched to inhaled epoprostenol, administered under a U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved investigational new drug license, before epidural catheter placement. The inhaled drug was continued because it achieved better control of pulmonary hypertension. An uneventful forceps-assisted vaginal delivery was performed, and intravenous epoprostenol was restarted after the delivery. Mother and baby were well 6 months postpartum.

- **Conclusion**: Intravenous epoprostenol treatment is effective in the management of pregnant and postpartum women with primary pulmonary hypertension. Inhaled epoprostenol was effective during the intrapartum and immediate postpartum period.

### An update on management of adult patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome: An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^112dDD7E]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Although significant advancements have been made in the management of ARDS, many questions remain. Several recommendations in this guideline are conditional in nature and, as such, require careful evaluation of patient and illness characteristics when considering their use. Future studies may serve to strengthen these recommendations or provide additional caveats to their implementation.

Measures with more established evidence of benefit also exist, including lung protective ventilation for all patients with ARDS and prone positioning for those with severe ARDS. Although strong recommendations in favor of these measures have previously been made, translating evidence into practice has been fraught with challenges. Considerable practice variation exists in ARDS management, and evidence-based modalities remain underused. This underuse is associated with increased mortality, suggesting that there is significant opportunity to improve ARDS outcomes.

To maximize these opportunities, future efforts must be made to facilitate access to readily available, granular data about ARDS management practices in real-world settings to allow for benchmarking, auditing, and continuous quality improvement. Additionally, it is crucial to understand the clinician-, systems-, and patient-level barriers to, and facilitators of, the use of evidence-based supportive care in ARDS to inform a comprehensive approach to implementation.

In addition to implementation research, there are several opportunities to address other areas of uncertainty. Much remains unknown about the impact of suppo

### Inhaled epoprostenol during one-lung ventilation [^114jxunX]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

We used inhaled epoprostenol, alongside intravenous phenylephrine, during one-lung ventilation to improve oxygenation in a patient with severe interstitial lung disease undergoing video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery. The pharmacologic manipulation of pulmonary blood flow remains an underused strategy for the management of hypoxemia during one-lung ventilation.

### Use of inhaled epoprostenol in patients with COVID-19 receiving humidified, high-flow nasal oxygen is associated with progressive respiratory failure [^112ovfzP]. CHEST Critical Care (2023). Low credibility.

In this retrospective analysis, the use of inhaled epoprostenol (iEpo) for patients receiving humidified high-flow nasal cannula (HHFNC) therapy was significantly associated with an increased risk for the composite outcome of mechanical ventilation or death without mechanical ventilation. This association persisted after multilevel modeling in a propensity score-matched cohort and multivariable modeling on an expanded, non-propensity score-matched population. This is one of the largest and most comprehensive studies assessing the clinical usefulness of inhaled pulmonary vasodilators in nonintubated patients at the time of writing. It adds to the growing body of literature surrounding the optimal management of acute hypoxemic respiratory failure for patients infected with SARS-CoV-2.

At the time of writing, no randomized controlled clinical trials have assessed the clinical impact of inhaled pulmonary vasodilators on mortality or days free of mechanical ventilation. Nevertheless, several studies have assessed the impact of inhaled pulmonary vasodilators on physiologic outcomes and have demonstrated that their use is associated with an improved PaO₂ to FiO₂ ratio, diastolic dysfunction, left ventricular end diastolic pressure, and pulmonary artery pressure. Although other studies have shown a less robust physiologic response, none have shown a clear worsening of physiologic parameters or raised concerns about safety. Despite the potential short-term physiologic benefits of iEpo, this study found that the use of iEpo was associated with worse outcomes in both the primary analysis and related sensitivity analysis.

### Are inhaled vasodilators useful in acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome [^117Fosao]. Respiratory Care (2010). Low credibility.

In patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), inhaled vasodilators can provide significant physiological benefits, such as improved hypoxemia, lower pulmonary arterial pressure, and enhanced right-ventricular function and cardiac output, without systemic hemodynamic effects. Inhaled nitric oxide (INO) and aerosolized prostacyclins are currently the most frequently used inhaled vasodilators. Inhaled prostacyclins are as effective physiologically as INO and are more cost-effective. Randomized controlled trials of INO in the treatment of ARDS have demonstrated short-term physiological benefits, but no improvement in long-term outcomes. No outcome studies have yet been reported on the use of prostacyclin in patients with ARDS. There is no role for the routine use of inhaled vasodilators in patients with ARDS. However, the use of inhaled vasodilators as a rescue therapy for severe refractory hypoxemia in ARDS patients might be reasonable, though it remains controversial.

### Long-term treatment of pulmonary hypertension with aerosolized iloprost [^111DqQqq]. European Respiratory Journal (2001). Low credibility.

Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), defined as elevated pulmonary arterial pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance, is an endpoint of a variety of conditions. The only therapy that has been shown to improve both quality of life and survival is intravenous prostacyclin (prostaglandin I2 (PGI2), epoprostenol). The effect of long-term aerosolized iloprost (Ilomedin, Schering, Berlin, Germany and Vienna, Austria), a stable prostacyclin analogue and potent vasodilator, on hemodynamics and functional status was investigated in 12 patients with severe pulmonary hypertension.

Hemodynamic measurements and vasodilator testing by right heart catheterization were performed prior to and after long-term iloprost inhalation therapy. Hemodynamic improvement or increased exercise tolerance was not observed in any of the patients. After a mean ± SD treatment period of 10 ± 5 months, mean ± SD pulmonary vascular resistance had increased from 11 ± 3 Wood Units (mmHg·L⁻¹·min) to 13 ± 4 Wood Units, with unchanged arterial oxygen saturation (92 ± 4% versus 91 ± 4%). Within the study period, three patients went into right heart failure and had to be placed on intravenous epoprostenol.

The authors conclude that inhaled iloprost, in addition to conventional therapy in the presently recommended dose of 100 microg·day⁻¹ delivered in 8–10 2-hour portions, is not an efficient vasodilator therapy in severe pulmonary hypertension. It remains to be shown whether dose increases and/or combination protocols will be effective, or whether inhalation of iloprost may be safe for selected cases of pulmonary hypertension.

### Aerosolized prostacyclins [^116JLvJa]. Respiratory Care (2004). Low credibility.

Two prostacyclins, prostaglandin E(1) and prostaglandin I(2), are potent vasodilators. Aerosolized prostacyclins reduce pulmonary artery pressure, improve right heart function, and increase arterial oxygenation by improving ventilation/perfusion matching. This report describes aerosolized prostacyclins and compares them to inhaled nitric oxide. It reviews the types of inhalable prostacyclins and their indications, evidence of efficacy, delivery, and adverse effects.

### Aerosolised iloprost improves pulmonary haemodynamics in patients with primary pulmonary hypertension receiving continuous epoprostenol treatment [^1178XCrE]. Thorax (2001). Low credibility.

Continuous intravenous treatment with epoprostenol significantly improves pulmonary haemodynamics and survival in patients with primary pulmonary hypertension (PPH). Its beneficial effect, however, may be blunted due to adverse effects such as catheter sepsis and systemic hypotension. Recent investigations have shown that inhaled iloprost is effective in the treatment of PPH. Based on their different pharmacokinetics, we hypothesized that the combination of intravenous epoprostenol and inhaled iloprost would be more efficacious than epoprostenol alone during acute testing in patients with PPH.

- **Methods**: The effect of a single dose of inhaled iloprost (30 microg total over 15 minutes) on pulmonary haemodynamics was examined in eight patients with PPH (initial non-responders to nitric oxide) who had considerable adverse effects during treatment with epoprostenol.

- **Results**: The combination of inhaled iloprost and intravenous epoprostenol significantly improved mean pulmonary artery pressure (MPAP), cardiac index (CI), mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO2), and systemic arterial oxygen pressure (PaO2) compared with epoprostenol treatment alone. Mean systemic arterial pressure (MSAP) and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) remained unchanged.

- **Conclusions**: The pulmonary vasoreactivity shown by additional iloprost inhalation during effective epoprostenol treatment suggests that an improvement of treatment for pulmonary hypertension may be possible by combining vasoactive substances.

### Effectiveness of transition from intravenous epoprostenol to oral/inhaled targeted pulmonary arterial hypertension therapy in pediatric idiopathic and familial pulmonary arterial hypertension [^115XuPxY]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2010). Low credibility.

Before 2001, intravenous epoprostenol was the only approved drug for patients with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH) or familial pulmonary arterial hypertension (FPAH) who were nonresponsive to high-dose calcium channel blockade. Investigators reported transitioning select pediatric patients with IPAH or FPAH from intravenous epoprostenol to oral and/or inhaled agents for pulmonary arterial hypertension.

A retrospective review was performed on all pediatric patients with IPAH or FPAH treated at Columbia University (1987 to 2008) who transitioned off epoprostenol to oral or inhaled drugs. Criteria for transition included functional class I or II and mean pulmonary arterial pressure for over 6 years. Hemodynamic and clinical data were obtained at baseline (before epoprostenol), at peak epoprostenol dose, and after epoprostenol discontinuation. Fourteen of 104 pediatric patients with IPAH or FPAH transitioned off epoprostenol to oral or inhaled drugs from April 2003 to July 2008. Of the 14 subjects, 13 transitioned off epoprostenol successfully to oral or inhaled drugs. No significant changes in functional class, hemodynamics, or exercise data were seen after epoprostenol (mean follow-up duration 7.0 ± 5.8 months) compared to peak epoprostenol, but further improvement was reported in World Health Organization functional class (p < 0.005) after epoprostenol discontinuation.

After successful epoprostenol discontinuation, 77% of patients were treated with endothelin receptor antagonists and 69% with phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors.

### Aggressive afterload lowering to improve the right ventricle: A new target for medical therapy in pulmonary arterial hypertension [^111JsVAQ]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Excessive dose titration of parenteral prostanoids and the risk of high cardiac output syndrome

Titration of parenteral prostanoids remains controversial. Most expert centers treat patients with periodic, slow, and steady dose escalation (every 1–2 weeks) of prostanoids after discharge from the hospital until they reach a maximally tolerated dose. According to Rich and colleagues, this approach could cause high cardiac output syndrome. In a series of 55 patients, 12 patients complained of flushing, bloating, and fatigue and had a normal to hypercontractile left ventricle. Those patients were treated with very high epoprostenol doses (98 + 61 ng/kg/min) and had a significant reduction in mPAP (−25% from baseline) and PVR (−71%), an increase in cardiac output (10.1 + 2.3 L/min), and a significant improvement in WHO FC (75% in FC I and 25% in FC II). The authors were able to reduce the epoprostenol dose by an average of 39% without any significant immediate change in mPAP, and all patients remained in WHO FC I or II after an average of 13.6 months. This observation underscores the need for careful follow-up of patients; it also raises the possibility of continuous ambulatory pulmonary pressure monitoring in prostanoid treatment to achieve dose optimization and avoid undesirable effects and overdose.

Transition from parenteral prostanoid to inhaled prostanoid, oral prostanoid, or selexipag

Inhaled prostanoids (iloprost, treprostinil), oral prostanoids (treprostinil, beraprost), and selexipag were developed to overcome problems associated with parenteral administration of prostanoids.

### Role of community health workers in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease care in low- and middle-income countries [^111yawgg]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). High credibility.

The study by Pollard and colleagues highlights the challenges in designing a feasible, properly structured intervention trial. Making inhaled medications containing long-acting bronchodilators accessible and affordable is crucial for demonstrating any measurable impact on clinical outcomes. The availability of spirometers, coupled with healthcare provider training, is essential for early diagnosis and management. Community health workers (CHWs) must play a more prominent role in the community, not only in raising awareness about COPD, its risk factors, and diagnosis but also in ensuring the availability and proper use of inhaled medications. Only then can CHWs significantly contribute to reducing the burden of COPD in low- and middle-income countries.

### The molecular targets of approved treatments for pulmonary arterial hypertension [^115dShWp]. Thorax (2016). Low credibility.

Epoprostenol is a synthetic salt of PGI2 and was the first prostanoid to be tested in patients with PAH. It is approved in the United States, Europe, and several other regions for the treatment of PAH in patients in WHO functional class (WHO FC) III and IV who do not respond adequately to conventional therapy. Epoprostenol is unstable, with a half-life of less than 5 minutes, and is administered intravenously via an indwelling central venous catheter connected to an infusion pump. As such, meticulous hygiene must be observed due to the risk of catheter site infection. Interruption of drug supply can result in severe and potentially fatal rebound pulmonary hypertension (PH). In 2008, a novel formulation was introduced (Veletri, Actelion Pharmaceuticals Ltd, Allschwil, Switzerland) that is stable at room temperature for up to 24 hours, eliminating the need for ice packs to cool the pump.

Iloprost is a carbacyclin analogue of PGI2 that has improved stability at room temperature and a longer half-life (20–30 minutes) compared with epoprostenol. It can be administered intravenously or by inhalation. Inhaled iloprost is approved in the United States for patients with PAH in WHO FC II or III, and in Europe and several other countries for patients with PAH in WHO FC III. Intravenous iloprost treatment has been evaluated in several open-label uncontrolled clinical studies; however, it has not been evaluated in a randomised controlled clinical trial, and is only approved in New Zealand for PAH.

### Therapy for pulmonary arterial hypertension in adults: Update of the CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^1122pL3m]. Chest (2019). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of pulmonary hypertension, particularly focusing on PAH-specific therapy, the ACCP 2019 guidelines recommend considering the addition of a parenteral (IV epoprostenol to improve 6MWD and WHO functional class or IV treprostinil to improve 6MWD) or inhaled prostanoid. This is advised for patients with PAH who exhibit WHO functional class III symptoms and are showing evidence of progression and/or markers of poor clinical prognosis despite treatment with 1–2 classes of oral agents.

### Nebulized treprostinil in mechanically ventilated children [^113bCFHk]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2025).

Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is attributable to lung disease in approximately one-third of affected children, many of whom require mechanical ventilation. For patients with heterogeneous lung disease, systemic pulmonary vasodilators may worsen ventilation-perfusion matching. The resultant hypoxemia can be mitigated by transitioning the route of administration from systemic (enteral or parenteral) to inhaled delivery.

Available inhaled pulmonary vasodilators include epoprostenol, iloprost, and treprostinil. Epoprostenol must be administered continuously, so outpatient use of inhaled epoprostenol is not feasible. Nebulized iloprost is an option in mechanically ventilated children with PH, but its short half-life necessitates frequent dosing, making it difficult to use in the outpatient setting. Nebulized treprostinil can be dosed less frequently and has been successfully used in children with PH. Administration of nebulized treprostinil through a tracheostomy tube has been described, and there are reports of its nonclinical in vitro use via mechanical ventilation; however, delivery to ventilated patients has not been previously reported.

This study describes the use of nebulized treprostinil in a cohort of mechanically ventilated children. All mechanically ventilated patients who received at least one dose of nebulized treprostinil at a large children's hospital over the course of 15 years were included. Details regarding the administration of nebulized treprostinil are available in the supplement. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at Nationwide Children's Hospital.

Development of clinical recommendations

Each group convened to develop initial recommendations for the individual PICO questions. The co-chairs and methodologists led the groups through a discussion of the evidence profiles and GRADE Evidence to Decision framework to determine the direction and strength of the recommendations (see online supplement). As part of the GRADE Evidence to Decision process, we considered the certainty of evidence, balance of desirable and undesirable consequences of an intervention, patient preferences and values, resource use, implications for health equity, acceptability of the intervention to stakeholders, and clinical feasibility. Evidence across the full spectrum of ARDS severity was unavailable for some interventions. For those interventions, recommendations were limited to the specific severity subgroups (i.e. mild, moderate, or severe) for which evidence was sufficient, and no recommendation was made for the subgroups for which it was not. Each recommendation was designated as "strong" or "conditional".

- **Manuscript preparation**: After the individual groups generated draft recommendations, these were presented to the full panel for detailed discussion, input, and approval. Final recommendations were determined by consensus of the full panel. Consistent with the GRADE approach, we had planned to use voting for recommendations that could not achieve consensus through discussion, but this was not required.

### Diagnosis and management of inhalation injury: an updated review [^112vqu6i]. Critical Care (2015). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on inhalation injury:

- **Definition**: Inhalation injury refers to damage to the respiratory tract and lungs caused by the inhalation of harmful substances such as smoke, gases, vapors, fumes, chemicals, dusts, mists, aerosols, or airborne particles.

- **Pathophysiology**: Thermal injuries typically affect the upper airway due to heat dissipation and protective reflexes, while chemical irritants in smoke damage both the upper and lower airways. This damage leads to mucosal sloughing, inflammatory mediator release, impaired mucociliary clearance, airway obstruction, and pulmonary edema. Systemic toxicity from inhaled carbon monoxide (CO) and cyanide exacerbates hypoxia by impairing oxygen transport and metabolism, potentially resulting in early mortality. Within 12–48 hours, necrotizing bronchitis, airway swelling, and pulmonary edema may cause respiratory failure, with increased susceptibility to infections due to epithelial necrosis.

- **Chemical inhalation injury**: This involves damage to the respiratory system through direct cellular interactions or alterations in the cellular microenvironment. Respiratory irritants, depending on their water solubility, liberate acids, alkali, and oxidants, triggering inflammatory cascades and damaging mucous membranes. Exposure to specific agents like metal fumes, hard metal dusts, and fluorocarbon breakdown products induces immunological and inflammatory responses through antigen-antibody complex formation, cytokine release, and neutrophil activation. Asphyxiant agents exacerbate hypoxia, with systemic asphyxiants intensifying this effect.

### Inhaled epoprostenol (prostacyclin) and pulmonary hypertension before cardiac surgery [^11293xP9]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

Pulmonary hypertension is commonly found in patients undergoing valvular surgery and can be worsened by cardiopulmonary bypass. Inhaled epoprostenol (prostacyclin) has been used for the treatment of pulmonary hypertension, but its effects compared with those of placebo on hemodynamics, oxygenation, echocardiographic examination, and platelet function have not been studied during cardiac surgery.

- **Methods**: Twenty patients with pulmonary hypertension undergoing cardiac surgery were randomized in a double-blind study to receive inhaled epoprostenol (60 µg) or placebo. The inhalation occurred after induction of anesthesia and before surgical incision. The effects on left and right systolic and diastolic cardiac functions evaluated by means of pulmonary artery catheterization and transesophageal echocardiography, as well as oxygenation and platelet aggregation, were studied.

- **Results**: Inhalation of epoprostenol significantly reduced indexed right ventricular stroke work from 10.7 ± 4.57 g·m·m⁻² to 7.8 ± 3.94 g·m·m⁻² (P = 0.003) and systolic pulmonary artery pressure from 48.4 ± 18 mm Hg to 38.9 ± 11.9 mm Hg (P = 0.002). The effect was correlated with the severity of pulmonary hypertension (r = 0.76, P = 0.01) and was no longer apparent after 25 minutes. There was no significant effect on systemic arterial pressures, left ventricular function, arterial oxygenation, platelet aggregation, and surgical blood loss.

In conclusion, inhaled epoprostenol reduces pulmonary pressure and improves right ventricular stroke work in patients with pulmonary hypertension undergoing cardiac surgery.
