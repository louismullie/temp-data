## Question

Explain gastroparesis with tirzepatide

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how tirzepatide relates to gastroparesis, including mechanism, clinical implications, risk quantification, special populations, and practical management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacology of tirzepatide and its effect on gastric emptying. Then, I should define gastroparesis and its diagnostic standards. Next, I will examine the clinical consequences of tirzepatide-induced gastric emptying delay, including aspiration risk and obstruction/ileus signals. After that, I should quantify risk from trials and real-world data, consider special populations, and finally translate this into practical management and monitoring recommendations, while double-checking areas of uncertainty and correcting any overstatements as needed.

> Let me first confirm the mechanism. Tirzepatide is a dual GIP/GLP-1 receptor agonist; GLP-1 agonism slows gastric emptying via fundic relaxation, increased pyloric tone, and reduced antral motility, whereas GIP does not independently slow gastric emptying, so the delay is primarily GLP-1–mediated, and importantly, this effect shows tachyphylaxis with repeated dosing, meaning attenuation over time even as glycemic and weight benefits persist [^111PxW4W] [^117BBy7C] [^113LanR1] [^1169ZKUH].

> I need to check the clinical relevance of that mechanism. Slowed gastric emptying contributes to early postprandial glucose lowering but is not the principal driver of chronic weight loss or A1c effects with tirzepatide; mediation analyses suggest GI symptoms account for only a small fraction of weight loss, reinforcing that central appetite effects and other mechanisms dominate with chronic therapy [^111VQNh6] [^115X2xS3] [^1139vEZg].

> Next, I should review what gastroparesis is and how it is diagnosed. Gastroparesis is delayed gastric emptying without mechanical obstruction; symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, early satiety, and abdominal pain correlate imperfectly with emptying rates, so objective testing with validated methods like 4-hour scintigraphy or stable-isotope breath testing is required to establish the diagnosis and severity, and I should confirm that these standards are indeed guideline-endorsed [^115Qz11c] [^117Pgb3J].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about tirzepatide causing clinical gastroparesis. I should verify whether tirzepatide has been studied in patients with severe gastroparesis. The FDA labeling advises avoiding tirzepatide in severe gastrointestinal disorders, including severe gastroparesis, and notes it has not been studied in this population, so any causal attribution is inference from mechanism rather than direct evidence; observational data on GLP-1 RAs and bowel obstruction/ileus are inconsistent, with some signals and others null, so I need to be cautious in overinterpreting risk estimates [^113BSCrE] [^114dzkm2] [^117GLHwb] [^117Cikvw].

> I will now examine the periprocedural safety implications because this is where delayed emptying has immediate consequences. Retained gastric contents after an overnight fast have been reported more frequently with GLP-1 RAs, raising aspiration risk during anesthesia or endoscopy; expert recommendations include considering prolonged fasting, point-of-care gastric ultrasound when available, and pharmacologic prokinesis such as IV erythromycin, while acknowledging that optimal pre-procedural holding intervals remain uncertain given long half-lives and tachyphylaxis variability [^115kKb55] [^114WqhZg] [^111HoFoZ].

> Wait, let me verify the magnitude of GI adverse events with tirzepatide to contextualize risk. In pooled trials, GI adverse reactions are common, dose-related, and cluster during dose escalation; nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea are the predominant events, and discontinuations due to GI adverse reactions increase with higher doses, though most events are mild to moderate and diminish over time, consistent with tachyphylaxis of gastric emptying effects [^1163Ni6L] [^115xuUSq] [^112869ud].

> I should double-check comparative safety signals. Large real-world cohort comparisons suggest broadly similar risks of severe GI events, including gastroparesis, across dulaglutide, semaglutide, and tirzepatide, supporting a class effect rather than a unique hazard signal for tirzepatide; nonetheless, rare events like obstruction or ileus remain variably reported and warrant vigilance, particularly in patients with predisposing motility disorders [^111gsy5W] [^117Cikvw].

> Let me consider special populations and contraindications. The FDA explicitly advises against tirzepatide in severe gastroparesis; in older adults, professional guidance recommends caution due to GI side effects and potential nutritional compromise, favoring slow titration and close monitoring; in diabetes with pre-existing delayed emptying, baseline motility may blunt further pharmacologic slowing, but symptoms can still worsen, so individualized risk–benefit assessment is prudent [^113BSCrE] [^1134EnJ1] [^116xoY9d].

> Next, I should review practical management to mitigate GI effects and procedural risk. Start low and go slow with 2.5 mg weekly and 2.5 mg increments every 4 weeks, counsel on smaller, lower-fat meals, maintain hydration, and consider short-term antiemetics or PPIs for persistent symptoms; for procedures, coordinate timing, extend fasting for solids, and consider gastric ultrasound or IV erythromycin if retained contents are suspected, recognizing that evidence for exact holding periods is limited and must balance aspiration risk against glycemic and weight destabilization [^116vW4sr] [^116eMZvr] [^114WqhZg].

> But wait, what if symptoms persist despite conservative measures. I need to ensure we do not mislabel functional dyspepsia as medication-induced gastroparesis; if objective delay is confirmed and symptoms are severe, guideline-directed prokinetic therapy such as metoclopramide may be considered with attention to safety, while recognizing that newer agents like prucalopride have limited and mixed evidence in gastroparesis and are not established for this indication in current guidelines [^114XC5bz] [^115jNJU6].

> In summary, tirzepatide's gastric emptying delay is real, transient, and primarily GLP-1–driven, with tachyphylaxis over time; it does not typically cause overt clinical gastroparesis in otherwise healthy users, but it can exacerbate symptoms in those with underlying motility disorders and creates meaningful periprocedural aspiration risk, so avoidance in severe gastroparesis, careful titration, symptom mitigation, and procedural planning are the key clinical takeaways [^113LanR1] [^113BSCrE] [^112tGoA3].

---

Tirzepatide delays gastric emptying via GLP-1–mediated effects [^113LanR1], which can **worsen or unmask gastroparesis** [^notfound], especially in patients with pre-existing delayed emptying [^notfound]. This increases the risk of **nausea, vomiting, and early satiety** [^115Qz11c] and may lead to **retained gastric contents** [^115kKb55] and aspiration during procedures [^114WqhZg]. Tirzepatide is **not recommended in severe gastroparesis** [^113BSCrE] and should be used with caution in mild cases, with slow dose escalation and close monitoring [^1134EnJ1]. If gastroparesis symptoms occur, consider dose reduction, dietary changes, or discontinuation [^116eMZvr].

---

## Mechanism of action and gastric emptying effects

- **GLP-1 receptor agonism**: Tirzepatide activates GLP-1 receptors, slowing gastric emptying and increasing satiety [^1165d3nu], which helps reduce postprandial glucose spikes and supports weight loss [^1165d3nu].

- **GIP receptor agonism**: GIP agonism does not independently delay gastric emptying [^117BBy7C] but may modulate GLP-1–mediated GI effects [^113Z3k18].

- **Tachyphylaxis**: With continued use, the gastric emptying delay attenuates over time, though a residual effect persists [^1169ZKUH] [^113LanR1].

---

## Clinical evidence of gastroparesis with tirzepatide

Clinical trials and postmarketing data show that tirzepatide is associated with **GI adverse effects** — nausea, vomiting, and early satiety — consistent with delayed gastric emptying [^1163Ni6L] [^115xuUSq]. These effects are typically **mild to moderate**, transient, and more frequent during dose escalation, often improving with continued use [^112869ud] [^115X2xS3]. In patients with pre-existing delayed gastric emptying, tirzepatide may **exacerbate symptoms** or unmask clinically significant gastroparesis [^11636DM6] [^116xoY9d].

---

## Risk factors and patient characteristics

Several factors increase the risk of **gastroparesis-like symptoms** with tirzepatide:

- **Pre-existing gastroparesis**: Patients with diabetic or idiopathic gastroparesis are at higher risk of symptom exacerbation [^114dzkm2] [^113BSCrE].

- **Diabetes mellitus**: Long-standing diabetes, especially with autonomic neuropathy, increases gastroparesis risk [^notfound].

- **Female sex**: Higher incidence of gastroparesis has been observed in women [^notfound].

- **Older age**: Older adults may have higher susceptibility to GI adverse effects [^115kMvvX].

---

## Clinical implications and management strategies

### Clinical implications

- **Symptom exacerbation**: Tirzepatide can worsen nausea, vomiting, early satiety, and abdominal discomfort in patients with gastroparesis [^114dzkm2] [^113BSCrE].

- **Nutritional risk**: Delayed gastric emptying may lead to malnutrition and weight loss, particularly in vulnerable patients [^notfound].

- **Procedural risk**: Retained gastric contents increase aspiration risk during anesthesia or endoscopy [^114WqhZg] [^115kKb55].

---

### Management strategies

- **Patient selection**: Avoid tirzepatide in patients with severe gastroparesis or significant GI motility disorders [^113BSCrE] [^114dzkm2].

- **Dose titration**: Use slow, gradual dose escalation to improve tolerability and reduce GI adverse effects [^116eMZvr] [^115yHGJT].

- **Dietary modifications**: Small, low-fat meals and dietary counseling can help manage symptoms [^116eMZvr].

- **Monitoring**: Regularly assess for GI symptoms, nutritional status, and weight changes [^1134EnJ1].

- **Pharmacologic interventions**: Consider antiemetics or prokinetic agents (e.g. metoclopramide) for persistent symptoms [^114XC5bz].

- **Dose reduction or discontinuation**: If symptoms persist, reduce the dose or discontinue tirzepatide [^116eMZvr].

---

## Comparison with other GLP-1 receptor agonists

Tirzepatide's gastric emptying delay is **comparable to that of selective GLP-1 RAs** (e.g. semaglutide, dulaglutide) [^112VSS9p] [^113LanR1]. GI adverse event rates are **similar to those with semaglutide** and other GLP-1 RAs, though individual tolerability may vary [^112869ud] [^111k7Hfq].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines emphasize **careful patient selection**, **slow dose titration**, and **close monitoring** for GI adverse effects with tirzepatide [^1134EnJ1]. Tirzepatide is **not recommended for patients with severe gastroparesis** or significant GI motility disorders [^113BSCrE] [^114dzkm2].

---

Tirzepatide can **worsen or unmask gastroparesis** through GLP-1–mediated gastric emptying delay, especially in patients with pre-existing delayed emptying. Use caution with slow titration and close monitoring, and avoid in severe gastroparesis; consider dose reduction or discontinuation if symptoms persist.

GLP-1RAs — Relationship Between Gastrointestinal Symptoms and Gastric Emptying (Central vs Peripheral Effect)

The quality of data relating to the effect of GLP-1RA on gastric emptying is highly variable, largely due to the continued use of imprecise measurement techniques like the paracetamol (acetaminophen) absorption technique, which continues to be used extensively. While inexpensive and simple to perform, its limitations are partitioning in the liquid phase and the inability to assess gastric emptying of solids reliably. Scintigraphy remains the gold-standard technique but is limited by cost, availability, and exposure to ionizing radiation. The stable isotope breath test represents an acceptable alternative that is noninvasive, simple to perform, and readily available and has been validated against scintigraphy.

Similarly, the evaluation of gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, which occur frequently with GLP-1RAs and have a major influence on the adherence to such treatment over time, have often been assessed in clinical trials solely via participant self-report, which is known to be unrelaible (eg, symptoms may not be volunteered due to embarrassment or poor recall). Validated instruments, developed to diagnose and differentiate functional gastrointestinal disorders, such as the Patient Assessment of Upper Gastrointestinal Disorder Symptom Severity Index questionnaire or the Gastroparesis Cardinal Symptom Index should be more widely used in clinical trials with GLP-1RAs.

In longstanding type 1 diabetes (T1D) and T2D, there is a high prevalence of upper and lower gastrointestinal symptoms; gastric emptying is delayed in 30% to 50% of individuals, and intragastric meal distribution is also frequently abnormal. It was traditionally believed that gastrointestinal symptoms were a direct outcome of a delay in gastric emptying. The majority of studies that have evaluated the relationship between the effects of GLP-1RAs on gastric emptying and gastrointestinal symptoms in health, obesity, or T2D have found no or weak correlations. Gastric emptying may be markedly delayed in the absence of symptoms, and in some individuals with severe symptoms, gastric emptying may be normal or accelerated. Uncomplicated T1D and T2D, as well as obesity, are often associated with more rapid rather than delayed gastric emptying. In the absence of GLP-1 RA treatment, the presence of symptoms is not a direct indicator of delayed gastric emptying. However, a recent study studying SC semaglutide obesity without T2D reported a significant relationship between gastrointestinal symptoms and gastric emptying after.

### Efficacy and tolerability of tirzepatide, a dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist in patients with type 2 diabetes: a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate different dose-escalation regimens [^113Y5LL1]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Treatment with glucagon‐like peptide‐1 (GLP‐1) receptor agonists (GLP‐1RAs) addresses multiple pathophysiological abnormalities of type 2 diabetes, providing an important therapeutic option for patients with this disease. GLP‐1 RAs improve glucose‐dependent insulin secretion, reduce glucagon secretion, and decrease the rate of gastric emptying. 1, 2, 3 They are also associated with a reduction in appetite with consequent weight loss. 1, 2, 3 These agents are associated with dose‐limiting side effects of nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea, 4, 5 and efforts have been made to improve efficacy and tolerability by investigating dose‐escalation regimens that allow attainment of higher doses, which are associated with greater efficacy, while limiting side effects. It has been reported that a slow escalation in dose can limit side effects while increasing the therapeutic utility of GLP‐1 RAs. 6, 7, 8, 9 In addition to the need to improve the tolerability of GLP‐1RAs, further improvement in their efficacy is of importance because not all patients treated with GLP‐1 RAs reach their glycaemic target and/or body weight reduction goals with currently available agents. 10

It should be appreciated that, in general, the use of DPP-4 inhibitors in these studies was associated with a higher risk of intestinal obstruction than GLP-1RAs. This is surprising, since the overall incidence of gastrointestinal adverse events is much higher with the latter class. This raises the question as to whether, if there is an effect, the underlying mechanisms do not relate to inhibitory effects on motility, since DPP-4 inhibitors appear to have little to no effect on this parameter in either obese subjects or those with T2D.

In summary, available data on the association of bowel obstruction or ileus with the use of GLP-1 RAs are inconsistent, and no definitive conclusions can be made. While some studies suggest up to 3-fold increase in risk, others report no association.

### Comparative gastrointestinal safety of dulaglutide, semaglutide, and tirzepatide in adults with type 2 diabetes [^111gsy5W]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The comparative gastrointestinal safety across glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists and tirzepatide is still unclear.

Objective

To compare the risk for severe gastrointestinal adverse events across dulaglutide, subcutaneous semaglutide, and tirzepatide in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) in routine clinical practice.

Design

New-user, active-comparator cohort study.

Setting

Population-based study.

Participants

Adults with T2D initiating dulaglutide, subcutaneous semaglutide, and tirzepatide between 1 January 2019 and 30 August 2024 in 3 cohorts corresponding to 3 pairwise comparisons.

Measurements

The primary outcome was a composite of acute pancreatitis, biliary disease, bowel obstruction, gastroparesis, and severe constipation. Secondary outcomes of interest were the individual components of the primary outcome. Patients were 1:1 propensity score matched within each comparison. We calculated hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% CIs.

Results

There were 65238 matched pairs in the semaglutide versus dulaglutide cohort, 20893 in the tirzepatide versus dulaglutide cohort, and 46620 in the tirzepatide versus semaglutide cohort. The HR of gastrointestinal events was 0.96 (95% CI, 0.87 to 1.06) in the semaglutide versus dulaglutide cohort, 0.96 (CI, 0.77 to 1.20) in the tirzepatide versus dulaglutide cohort, and 1.07 (CI, 0.90 to 1.26) in the tirzepatide versus semaglutide cohort.

Limitation

Possible residual confounding by glycemic control and body mass index.

Conclusion

These findings suggest that dulaglutide, semaglutide, and tirzepatide have similar gastrointestinal safety profiles in adults with T2D. This study provides clinicians with evidence to weigh the benefits and risks of these medications.

### Tirzepatide: a double agonist for various people living with type 2 diabetes [^1153nGr9]. Diabetes Therapy (2024). Medium credibility.

Clinicians might now wonder whether these results can apply to specific subgroups of people with T2D. Numerous post hoc analyses presented in the last couple of years at the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) congresses offer a comprehensive overview of the broad spectrum of people who could benefit from tirzepatide. In the following section, we report the results of some analyses that can help us better identify the characteristics of such patients.

All over the world, most of the people living with T2D attending diabetes centers are over 65 years of age. A post hoc analysis of the five SURPASS studies showed that tirzepatide afforded significantly greater HbA1c reductions versus placebo or an active comparator irrespective of age at baseline (< 65 years/ ≥ 65 years) at the expense of gastrointestinal adverse events (nausea, diarrhea, dyspepsia, constipation, vomiting) and decreased appetite. Across the studies, the incidence of severe hypoglycemia (requiring external help) with blood glucose dropping to less than 54 mg/dL was similar between both age subgroups and was consistent with the overall study population and background therapies.

Another post hoc analysis of SURPASS studies assessed glycemic control with tirzepatide in participants stratified by baseline HbA1c (≤ 8.5%, > 8.5%) to evaluate the consistency across subgroups. Throughout those studies, consistently with the primary ones, tirzepatide showed meaningful HbA1c reductions vs. the other comparators irrespective of baseline HbA1c, and was generally well tolerated, except for the well-known gastrointestinal adverse events, and a low incidence of mostly mild-to-moderate hypoglycemia in both subgroups.

In the previous year several discussions arose on the efficacy of GLP-1RAs in people with a long duration of T2DM. Therefore, a further post hoc analysis of the five SURPASS studies was conducted to investigate whether or not the efficacy and safety of tirzepatide were influenced by diabetes duration stratified as follows: (i) ≤ 5 years, (ii) between 5 and 10 years, (iii) > 10 years. For all the five SURPASS studies, HbA1c changes from baseline at 40 or 52 weeks were consistent with the primary study results for all three subgroups, with treatment differences favoring all three doses of tirzepatide vs. placebo or the active comparator.

Abbreviations: GLP-1RA, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist.

The following research questions can be identified for future studies to clarify unresolved issues: (1) What would be an appropriate duration of cessation of GLP-1RA therapy to avoid retained gastric content and aspiration? Individual answers may be required for various compounds in the class of incretin mimetic drugs. (2) How effective is pharmacological acceleration of gastric emptying (eg, with IV erythromycin) in individuals on GLP-1RA-based therapy and retained gastric content? (3) How effectively can a 24-hour period with intake only of clear fluids with 3 days of a low-residue diet reduce the risk of retained gastric contents and aspiration? Ideally, measurement of gastric emptying using an appropriate technique (eg, scintigraphy or stable isotope breath test) should be routine in clinical trials evaluating GLP-1RA-based therapy.

### Tirzepatide (Zepbound) [^113BSCrE]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of tirzepatide SC (also known as Mounjaro, Zepbound):

- **Acute pancreatitis**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as tirzepatide has been associated with an increased risk of acute pancreatitis, including fatal and non-fatal hemorrhagic and necrotizing pancreatitis. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of pancreatitis. Discontinue tirzepatide if acute pancreatitis is suspected.
- **Anaphylaxis, angioedema**: use caution in patients with a history of anaphylaxis or angioedema with other GLP-1 receptor agonists.
- **Decreased blood glucose**: use caution in patients taking insulin or insulin secretagogues. Consider reducing the insulin or insulin secretagogue dose.
- **Exacerbation of diabetic retinopathy**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as rapid improvement in glucose control has been associated with a temporary worsening of diabetic retinopathy. Monitor for progression of diabetic retinopathy.
- **Exacerbation of gastrointestinal disorders**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as tirzepatide has been associated with an increased risk of gastrointestinal adverse reactions. Avoid using tirzepatide in patients with severe gastrointestinal disorders, including severe gastroparesis.
- **Gallbladder disease**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as tirzepatide has been associated with an increased risk of cholelithiasis and cholecystitis.
- **Suicidal ideation**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as suicidal behavior and ideation have been reported in clinical trials with other chronic weight management products. Monitor for new or worsening depression, suicidal thoughts/behavior, and/or changes in mood or behavior. Avoid using tirzepatide in patients with a history of suicidal attempts or active suicidal ideation. Discontinue tirzepatide if suicidal thoughts or behaviors occur.

### Tirzepatide versus semaglutide on weight loss in type 2 diabetes patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis of direct comparative studies [^1172fhpF]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

An important note for GLP‐1 GI AEs is that standard approaches may not correctly characterise the incidence of GI AEs given the mechanism of action of GLP‐1 RAs, which decrease gastric emptying and suppress appetite to reduce overall food intake. Rather than vomiting, nausea was reported more frequently as the reason for treatment discontinuation in the SUSTAIN and PIONEER trials. However, a gradual dose escalation may be able to increase tolerability and reduce the frequency of GI AEs. There has been some speculation on the contribution of GI AEs to the weight reduction seen in GLP‐1 RAs, but mediation analysis suggests a minimal contribution. Overall, both semaglutide and tirzepatide are well tolerated and AEs are deemed mild to moderate in severity.

### Efficacy and tolerability of tirzepatide, a dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist in patients with type 2 diabetes: a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate different dose-escalation regimens [^111QJu6B]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Table 2
Summary of treatment‐emergent adverse events (AEs)

The number of patients with the combined AEs of nausea, vomiting and/or diarrhoea was numerically greater in the tirzepatide 15 mg‐1 treatment group (57.1%) compared with the 12 mg group (48.3%) and the 15 mg‐2 group (46.4%); all of the tirzepatide treatment groups reported more nausea, vomiting and/or diarrhoea than placebo (11.5%). The severity of the nausea, vomiting and/or diarrhoea events was mild to moderate in intensity. None of the nausea, vomiting and/or diarrhoea events were severe.

Further evaluation of GI AEs incidence from the first onset data showed that the AEs most probably to occurred following the first dose (4 or 2.5 mg), and the incidence and prevalence may have been reduced with lower starting doses when comparing the incidence of nausea, vomiting and/or diarrhoea in the tirzepatide 4 mg dose (12 mg group) with the 2.5 mg doses (15 mg‐1 and 15 mg‐2 groups) (Table 3). Also, smaller subsequent dose escalations were more probably associated with a lower incidence of the combined nausea, vomiting and/or diarrhoea AEs, as noted when comparing 2.5 mg (15 mg‐1 group) and 4 mg increments (12 mg group) with 5 mg (15 mg‐1 and 15 mg‐2 groups) or 7.5 mg (15 mg‐2 group) increments.

### Gastrointestinal tolerability and weight reduction associated with tirzepatide in adults with obesity or overweight with and without type 2 diabetes in the SURMOUNT-1 to-4 trials [^115X2xS3]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Aims

This analysis evaluated whether gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events (AEs) including nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea (N/V/D) and dyspepsia were associated with weight reduction with tirzepatide across the SURMOUNT‐1 to ‐4 trials.

Materials and Methods

SURMOUNT‐1 to ‐4 were global Phase 3 clinical trials evaluating the safety and efficacy of tirzepatide among participants with obesity or overweight with or without type 2 diabetes (T2D). Participants were randomly assigned to receive once weekly subcutaneous tirzepatide or placebo. This post hoc analysis investigated weight change at the primary endpoint from baseline among participants who self‐reported no N/V/D, any N/V/D or nausea alone. Mediation analyses evaluated the contribution of N/V/D and dyspepsia on weight reduction. Time to first use of antidiarrheal and antiemetic usage was reported by time intervals.

Results

Baseline characteristics were similar between participants who reported N/V/D and those who did not. More participants reported GI AEs in the tirzepatide treatment arms (27.8%–72.8%) than with placebo (12.2%–32.5%). Most GI AEs were non‐serious and occurred during dose escalation. Between 1.0% and 10.5% of tirzepatide‐treated participants discontinued treatment due to GI AEs. Weight reduction with tirzepatide was similar among participants reporting no nausea, nausea alone, or any N/V/D. Mediation analyses suggested that N/V/D and dyspepsia were associated with up to 3.1% of total weight reduction. When required, first use of antidiarrheal and antiemetic medication was most commonly reported during dose escalation.

Conclusions

In this post hoc analysis, GI AEs appeared to contribute slightly to the weight reduction seen with tirzepatide in participants with obesity or overweight with or without T2D.

5.1 Risk of Thyroid C-Cell Tumors

In rats, tirzepatide caused a dose-dependent and treatment-duration-dependent increase in the incidence of thyroid C-cell tumors (adenomas and carcinomas) in a 2-year study at clinically relevant plasma exposures [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. It is unknown whether ZEPBOUND causes thyroid C-cell tumors, including MTC, in humans as human relevance of tirzepatide-induced rodent thyroid C-cell tumors has not been determined.

ZEPBOUND is contraindicated in patients with a personal or family history of MTC or in patients with MEN 2. Counsel patients regarding the potential risk for MTC with the use of ZEPBOUND and inform them of symptoms of thyroid tumors (e.g., a mass in the neck, dysphagia, dyspnea, persistent hoarseness).

Routine monitoring of serum calcitonin or using thyroid ultrasound is of uncertain value for early detection of MTC in patients treated with ZEPBOUND. Such monitoring may increase the risk of unnecessary procedures, due to the low test specificity for serum calcitonin and a high background incidence of thyroid disease. Significantly elevated serum calcitonin values may indicate MTC and patients with MTC usually have calcitonin values > 50 ng/L. If serum calcitonin is measured and found to be elevated, the patient should be further evaluated. Patients with thyroid nodules noted on physical examination or neck imaging should also be further evaluated.

5.2 Severe Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions

Use of ZEPBOUND has been associated with gastrointestinal adverse reactions, sometimes severe [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. In a pool of two ZEPBOUND clinical trials for weight reduction (Studies 1 and 2), severe gastrointestinal adverse reactions were reported more frequently among patients receiving ZEPBOUND (5 mg 1.7%, 10 mg 2.5%, 15 mg 3.1%) than placebo (1%). Similar rates of severe gastrointestinal adverse reactions were observed in ZEPBOUND clinical trials for weight reduction and in ZEPBOUND clinical trials for OSA.

ZEPBOUND has not been studied in patients with severe gastrointestinal disease, including severe gastroparesis, and is therefore not recommended in these patients.

4 DISCUSSION

This post hoc analysis provides a comprehensive assessment of the potential relationship of GI AEs to weight reduction associated with tirzepatide treatment across the SURMOUNT‐1 to ‐4 trials. Results from this study suggest that GI AEs including nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and dyspepsia were minimally related to the weight reduction observed with tirzepatide treatment.

Data from the SURMOUNT‐1 to ‐4 trials indicated that the occurrence and frequency of GI AEs were significantly higher in participants treated with tirzepatide in comparison with placebo, with the most frequent GI AEs being nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. Across the SURMOUNT‐1 to ‐4 trials, GI AEs were mostly mild‐to‐moderate in severity, occurred during dose escalations and resulted in few treatment discontinuations. These results are consistent with reports of treatment with tirzepatide in the SURPASS trials, and with results observed with other OMMMs targeting GLP‐1 receptors.

### Gastrointestinal tolerability and weight reduction associated with tirzepatide in adults with obesity or overweight with and without type 2 diabetes in the SURMOUNT-1 to-4 trials [^116Vze4b]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Obesity is a major chronic disease, expected to affect nearly two billion people by 2035. Obesity and its complications severely impact patients' quality of life, and greatly contribute to global mortality. Clinical practice guidelines recommend the use of obesity management medications (OMMs) in addition to lifestyle modification in patients with a body mass index (BMI) of 30 kg/m 2 or more (obesity), or 27 kg/m 2 or more (overweight) with weight‐related comorbidities.

Tirzepatide is a glucose‐dependent insulinotropic polypeptide and glucagon‐like peptide‐1 (GLP‐1) receptor agonist, indicated for the treatment of obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D). The global Phase 3 SURMOUNT‐1 to ‐4 clinical trials evaluated the efficacy and safety of tirzepatide (5, 10, 15 mg or maximum tolerated dose [MTD, 10 or 15 mg]) versus placebo, among participants with obesity or overweight with or without T2D. Tirzepatide led to substantial and clinically meaningful weight reduction across all doses in comparison with placebo in the SURMOUNT‐1 to ‐4 trials.,

Tirzepatide and other newer incretin‐based OMMs are associated with gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events (AEs), most commonly nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. In clinical trials, GI AEs associated with tirzepatide were typically mild‐to‐moderate in severity, transient and occurred during dose escalation. However, it is not known whether GI AEs contribute to the weight reduction seen with tirzepatide in people with obesity or overweight with or without T2D.

### Efficacy and safety in tirzepatide-treated Korean adults with type 2 diabetes – A post hoc analysis of SURPASS-AP-combo and SURPASS-3 [^117EV1YM]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

Consistent with the overall results of the SURPASS‐AP‐Combo and SURPASS‐3 trials, this post hoc subgroup analysis found clinically meaningful reductions in HbA1c and body weight after treatment periods of 40 to 52 weeks in Koreans with T2D treated with tirzepatide. These beneficial associations of tirzepatide with lower HbA1c and body weight were not significantly affected by the baseline BMI, age, or duration of diabetes of the treated Korean patients in SURPASS‐AP‐Combo. In addition, patterns of TEAEs and SAEs during treatment with tirzepatide in Korean participants were generally consistent with those in the overall SURPASS‐AP‐Combo and SURPASS‐3 populations, with no deaths and few SAEs or hypoglycaemic events reported. The most common TEAEs in Korean participants in both trials were gastrointestinal (nausea, diarrhoea and dyspepsia), and the tolerability and safety profile of tirzepatide appeared to be comparable to that of the overall populations of SURPASS‐AP‐Combo and SURPASS‐3.

Aims

This analysis evaluated whether gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events (AEs) including nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea (N/V/D) and dyspepsia were associated with weight reduction with tirzepatide across the SURMOUNT-1 to -4 trials.

Materials and Methods

SURMOUNT-1 to -4 were global Phase 3 clinical trials evaluating the safety and efficacy of tirzepatide among participants with obesity or overweight with or without type 2 diabetes (T2D). Participants were randomly assigned to receive once weekly subcutaneous tirzepatide or placebo. This post hoc analysis investigated weight change at the primary endpoint from baseline among participants who self-reported no N/V/D, any N/V/D or nausea alone. Mediation analyses evaluated the contribution of N/V/D and dyspepsia on weight reduction. Time to first use of antidiarrheal and antiemetic usage was reported by time intervals.

Results

Baseline characteristics were similar between participants who reported N/V/D and those who did not. More participants reported GI AEs in the tirzepatide treatment arms (27.8%-72.8%) than with placebo (12.2%-32.5%). Most GI AEs were non-serious and occurred during dose escalation. Between 1.0% and 10.5% of tirzepatide-treated participants discontinued treatment due to GI AEs. Weight reduction with tirzepatide was similar among participants reporting no nausea, nausea alone, or any N/V/D. Mediation analyses suggested that N/V/D and dyspepsia were associated with up to 3.1% of total weight reduction. When required, first use of antidiarrheal and antiemetic medication was most commonly reported during dose escalation.

Conclusions

In this post hoc analysis, GI AEs appeared to contribute slightly to the weight reduction seen with tirzepatide in participants with obesity or overweight with or without T2D.

TEAEs

Consistent with the overall SURPASS trial population and across the five reported subgroups of baseline characteristics, the most common TEAEs of the gastrointestinal system organ class were nausea, diarrhea, dyspepsia, decreased appetite, vomiting, and constipation. Gastrointestinal TEAEs occurred in all subgroups and trials: 22.2–66.7% for all doses of tirzepatide, 7.7–27.5% for placebo, 5.3–13.5% for insulin degludec, 12.8–16.5% for insulin glargine, and 33.3–48.4% for semaglutide 1 mg (Table 5). The number of participants with ≥ 1 gastrointestinal TEAE was consistent across participant subgroups stratified by baseline HbA1c, baseline duration of T2D, baseline age, sex, or baseline BMI.

7 SUMMARY OF SAFETY DATA THUS FAR

Tirzepatide use is associated with gastrointestinal symptoms, most commonly nausea, diarrhoea, vomiting, constipation, abdominal pain and dyspepsia, among other adverse effects. Results from the SURMOUNT and SURPASS trials indicate that the gastrointestinal symptoms following tirzepatide treatment were typically transient and of mild‐to‐moderate severity, with the majority of adverse events occurring at treatment initiation and dose escalation. The frequencies of serious adverse events between tirzepatide‐ and placebo‐treated participants were generally comparable. Furthermore, the SURMOUNT‐1 3‐year study reported decreased incidence of gastrointestinal adverse events with tirzepatide use over time, supporting the long‐term use of tirzepatide among people with obesity or overweight, with or without T2D. A meta‐analysis of 12 randomized controlled trials of tirzepatide demonstrated that the total incidence of adverse events following tirzepatide treatment was similar to GLP‐1 receptor agonists (dulaglutide and semaglutide) and expectedly higher than placebo and insulin groups.

Among adverse events of special interest, clinical trials have assessed pancreatitis, cholecystitis, hypoglycaemia, MACE and neoplasms (including medullary thyroid cancer). According to a meta‐analysis of 12 randomized clinical trials, the risk of pancreatitis, cholecystitis, MACE‐4 and neoplasms following tirzepatide treatment appears to be comparable to GLP‐1 receptor agonists, placebo or insulin. Tirzepatide is associated with significantly lower hypoglycaemic risk compared with insulin (p < 0.01).

Concomitant Antidiabetic Medication

Tirzepatide in combination with sulphonylurea (SU) or insulin may increase the risk of hypoglycemia, so it can be considered a dose reduction of these concomitant medications. To adjust the dose, blood glucose self-monitoring is necessary following a stepwise approach. Clinically significant hypoglycemia was reported in 10–14% (0.14–0.16 events/patient year) of patients when tirzepatide was combined with sulphonylurea and in 14–19% (0.43–0.64 events/patient year) of patients when tirzepatide was combined with basal insulin. In case of tirzepatide use in monotherapy or in combination with other oral antidiabetic drugs, the rate was up to 0.04 events/patient year.

The patients included in the SURPASS-5 clinical trial with a baseline HbA1c level ≤ 8%, reduced the insulin dose by 20% after randomization. There are no specific recommendations on how much the dose of the sulphonylurea should be reduced when used in combination with tirzepatide, however other authors have proposed a reduction in the dose of SU by 50% if HbA1c is < 8.5%, when used in combination with SGLT2i.

Gastrointestinal (GI) AEs

The most common AEs reported with tirzepatide are GI, which include nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. GI events were mostly mild or moderate in severity, and higher during the dose-escalation period and generally decreased over time. The incidence of these GI effects was similar to that reported with semaglutide 1 mg. Permanent treatment discontinuation due the described GI AEs was low (< 6% of patients discontinued treatment due to nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea).

To mitigate GI events, the same considerations as with GLP-1 RA treatment could be taken into account, i.e. patients can be advised to eat smaller portions with less fat content; when GI AEs persist, the short-term prescription of omeprazole and/or antiemetic drugs could be considered; a reduction in the dose and a slower dose titration could be considered.

### Gastroparesis: symptoms, evaluation, and treatment [^113QLoTF]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

Gastroparesis presents with gastrointestinal symptoms and nongastrointestinal manifestations in association with objective delays in gastric emptying. The condition may complicate several systemic disorders or may be idiopathic in nature. The diagnosis is made by directed evaluation to exclude organic diseases, which can mimic the clinical presentation of gastroparesis coupled with quantification of gastric emptying. Current therapies rely on dietary modifications, medications to stimulate gastric evacuation, and agents to reduce vomiting. Endoscopic and surgical options are increasingly used for cases refractory to medication treatment.

### Clinical consequences of delayed gastric emptying with GLP-1 receptor agonists and tirzepatide [^115kKb55]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Context

Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists (RAs) are established therapeutics for type 2 diabetes and obesity. Among other mechanisms, they slow gastric emptying and motility of the small intestine. This helps to limit postprandial glycemic excursions and reduce chylomicron formation and triglyceride absorption. Conversely, motility effects may have detrimental consequences, eg, retained gastric contents at endoscopy or general anesthesia, potentially complicated by pulmonary aspiration or bowel obstruction.

Data Acquisition

We searched the PubMed database for studies involving GLP-1RA therapy and adverse gastrointestinal/biliary events.

Data Synthesis

Retained gastric contents at the time of upper gastrointestinal endoscopy are found more frequently with GLP-1 RAs but rarely are associated with pulmonary aspiration. Well-justified recommendations for the periprocedural management of GLP-1RAs (eg, whether to withhold these medications and for how long) are compromised by limited evidence. Important aspects to be considered are (1) their long half-lives, (2) the capacity of GLP-1 receptor agonism to slow gastric emptying even at physiological GLP-1 concentrations, (c) tachyphylaxis observed with prolonged treatment, and (d) the limited effect on gastric emptying in individuals with slow gastric emptying before initiating treatment. Little information is available on the influence of diabetes mellitus itself (ie, in the absence of GLP-1 RA treatment) on retained gastric contents and pulmonary aspiration.

Conclusion

Prolonged fasting periods regarding solid meal components, point-of-care ultrasound examination for retained gastric content, and the use of prokinetic medications like erythromycin may prove helpful and represent an important area needing further study to increase patient safety for those treated with GLP-1 RAs.

### Clinical consequences of delayed gastric emptying with GLP-1 receptor agonists and tirzepatide [^117Cikvw]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

A similar finding was reported in an analysis of adverse drug reactions using the World Health Organization pharmacovigilance database VigiBase. Of 501 244 adverse reactions reported with diabetes drugs between 2007 and 2018, only 698 (1.4%) involved "gastrointestinal stenosis and obstruction", of which 216 (∼ 0.04% of the total) were treated with GLP-1RAs. Almost 30% of the events were reported by nonmedically trained individuals, which may affect the diagnostic accuracy of these findings. While an increased odds ratio (OR) was evident for bowel obstruction with GLP-1RAs (OR 3.05, 95% CI 2.54–3.66), reporting rates varied substantially from year to year (eg, odds ratios for GLP-1RAs varied between ∼ 1 in the years 2008, 2010, 2013, and 2014 vs ∼ 3 in 2009, 2011, 2012, and 2015). Considering the increased availability and use of GLP-1RAs in people with and without T2D in recent years, the lack of a corresponding rise in reports is worth mentioning.

Based on a Bayesian analysis of the US Food and Drug Administration averse event reporting system database from April 2005 to December 2021, a modest but statistically significant increase in ileus cases (information component, a measure of the strength of the correlation between GLP-1RA use and ileus [IC 025], ∼ 0.12–0.77) was found for some GLP-1RAs, although semaglutide (IC 025 −0.77) was not associated with an increase in events. In contrast, another study applying similar methodology in the same database for events between January 2018 and September 2022 reported a significant association of ileus cases with semaglutide (IC 025 3.04 [0.11 lower one-sided 95% CI]), but not for any other GLP-1RAs.

### Tirzepatide, a dual GIP / GLP-1 receptor co-agonist for the treatment of type 2 diabetes with unmatched effectiveness regrading glycaemic control and body weight reduction [^113Z3k18]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2022). Medium credibility.

Adverse events reported with tirzepatide (dual GIP/GLP-1 receptor co-agonist)

In clinical trials employing tirzepatide, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, and constipation were the main side effects reported. These "gastrointestinal" side effects appear to be qualitatively similar to those reported in clinical studies with selective GLP-1 RAs, and display some dose-dependency (Additional file 1: Figure S3). Therefore, in quantitative terms, a comparison to selective GLP-1 RAs is of particular interest. Table 2 presents the proportion of patients reporting nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, constipation, or any gastrointestinal adverse event in studies comparing tirzepatide at 5, 10, or 15 mg per week to dulaglutide (1.5 mg per week) or semaglutide (1 mg/week). As shown in Table 2, higher doses of tirzepatide are associated with more of these side effects (see also Additional file 1: Figure S3).

However, in both studies, there was a trend for numerically greater effectiveness of tirzepatide (5 mg per week) as compared to dulaglutide (phase 2 study; GPWB) or semaglutide (SURPASS-2), with respect to improving glycaemic control (HbA 1c) and reducing body weight, but fewer patients reported "gastrointestinal" side effects as compared to those treated with dulaglutide or semaglutide. This may indicate that for a given efficacy, tirzepatide elicits less gastrointestinal adverse events than do selective GLP-1 RAs. Along these lines, GIPR agonism in animal experiments had the ability to reduce GLP-1-induced nausea and vomiting, or an equivalent behaviour. The availability of three doses of tirzepatide provides the flexibility to find an individual optimum relating effectiveness and tolerability.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Baseline characteristics by gastrointestinal adverse events

Demographics and baseline clinical characteristics were generally similar between treatment arms within each trial. Differences in baseline characteristics observed across trials reflect differences in inclusion criteria and design. SURMOUNT‐2 included participants with obesity and T2D; these participants had a longer duration of obesity and higher HbA1c level at baseline in comparison with other SURMOUNT trials. Additionally, SURMOUNT‐3 participants underwent an intensive lifestyle programme prior to treatment initiation; participants had lower BMI, weight and waist circumference at randomization in comparison with other trials. In SURMOUNT‐1, ‐3 and ‐4, there were more female participants; in SURMOUNT‐1 to ‐4, there were more White participants.,

Within each SURMOUNT‐1 to ‐4 trial, demographics and baseline clinical characteristics were similar overall among participants between subgroups that did or did not report any N/V/D GI AE (Table 1).

TABLE 1
Baseline characteristics.

3.2 Relationship of gastrointestinal adverse events with weight reduction

Data from the SURMOUNT‐1 to ‐4 trials indicate that nausea, diarrhoea and vomiting were the most frequent GI AEs, occurring at significantly higher frequencies in the tirzepatide treatment arms in comparison with placebo (Table S1). Dyspepsia and constipation were also frequent GI AEs. Across the SURMOUNT‐1 to ‐4 trials, 27.8% to 72.8% of participants reported at least one GI AE in the tirzepatide treatment arms, and 12.2% to 32.5% in the placebo arms. Most GI AEs were mild‐to‐moderate in severity; severe or serious GI AEs occurred in 0.3% to 5.6% of participants (Table S2). Treatment discontinuation due to GI AEs occurred in 1.0% to 10.5% of participants treated with tirzepatide (Table S3). Study discontinuation due to GI AEs occurred in 0.0% to 2.2% of participants treated with tirzepatide (Table S3). GI AEs were primarily reported during dose escalations.

### Efficacy and tolerability of tirzepatide, a dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist in patients with type 2 diabetes: a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate different dose-escalation regimens [^115yHGJT]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Aim

To assess the efficacy and tolerability of tirzepatide treatment using three different dose-escalation regimens in patients with type 2 diabetes.

Materials and Methods

In this double-blind, placebo-controlled study, patients were randomized (1:1:1:1) to receive either once-weekly subcutaneous tirzepatide or placebo. The tirzepatide dose groups and dose-escalation regimens were: 12mg (4mgweeks 0–3; 8mgweeks 4–7; 12mgweeks 8–11), 15mg-1 (2.5mgweeks 0–1; 5mgweeks 2–3; 10mgweeks 4–7; 15mgweeks 8–11) and 15mg-2 (2.5mgweeks 0–3; 7.5mgweeks 4–7; 15mgweeks 8–11). The primary objective was to compare tirzepatide with placebo in HbA1c change from baseline at 12weeks.

Results

Overall, 111 patients were randomized: placebo, 26; tirzepatide 12mg, 29; tirzepatide 15mg-1, 28; tirzepatide 15mg-2, 28. The mean age was 57.4years, HbA1c 8.4% and body mass index 31.9kg/m 2. At week 12, absolute HbA1c change from baseline (SE) was greater in the tirzepatide treatment groups compared with placebo (placebo, +0.2% [0.21]; 12mg, -1.7% [0.19]; 15mg-1, -2.0% [0.20]; 15mg-2, -1.8% [0.19]). The incidence of nausea was: placebo, 7.7%; 12mg group, 24.1%; 15mg-1 group, 39.3%; 15mg-2 group, 35.7%. Three patients discontinued the treatment because of adverse events, one from each of the placebo, 12mg and 15mg-1 groups.

Conclusions

Tirzepatide treatment for 12weeks resulted in clinically significant reductions in HbA1c. This suggests that lower starting doses and smaller dose increments are associated with a more favourable side effect profile.

Lipid Profile

Tirzepatide was associated with dose-dependent favourable effects on lipid profile, including reductions in triglycerides and very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C), and increases in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) in SURPASS-1–5. In SURPASS-4, tirzepatide 5, 10 and 15 mg reduced triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and total cholesterol, and increased HDL-C, compared with baseline and the active comparator in the high CV risk population (82% on lipid-lowering therapy at baseline, which was continued throughout the study). In SURPASS-2, reductions in triglycerides and VLDL-C with tirzepatide (all doses) exceeded those seen with semaglutide 1 mg.

Insulin Use

In SURPASS-5, participants on tirzepatide required significantly less background basal insulin than those on placebo (p < 0.001, all doses). By the end of the study, mean daily insulin dose decreased from baseline by 3.8 U (− 11.4%) in participants receiving insulin glargine plus tirzepatide 15 mg but increased by 25.1 U (75%) in those receiving insulin glargine plus placebo. (Participants self-adjusted background daily insulin glargine dose on the basis of self-monitored blood glucose using a treat-to-target algorithm.)

Tolerability

The most common adverse events with tirzepatide were similar to those seen with GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA), namely gastrointestinal (GI) events such as nausea, diarrhoea and vomiting. These were mostly mild-to-moderate in severity and transient, occurring more frequently during the dose escalation phase of each study (Fig. S3, Supplementary Appendix). Severe diarrhoea and severe vomiting were uncommon with tirzepatide, affecting 0.31% and 0.25% of participants, respectively. In SURPASS-2, the rates of all reported GI side effects — including nausea, diarrhoea, vomiting, dyspepsia, decreased appetite, constipation and abdominal pain — occurring with tirzepatide (40–44.9%) were generally comparable to those seen with semaglutide (41.2%).

Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions

In the pool of placebo-controlled trials, gastrointestinal adverse reactions occurred more frequently among patients receiving MOUNJARO than placebo (placebo 20.4%, MOUNJARO 5 mg 37.1%, MOUNJARO 10 mg 39.6%, MOUNJARO 15 mg 43.6%). More patients receiving MOUNJARO 5 mg (3.0%), MOUNJARO 10 mg (5.4%), and MOUNJARO 15 mg (6.6%) discontinued treatment due to gastrointestinal adverse reactions than patients receiving placebo (0.4%). The majority of reports of nausea, vomiting, and/or diarrhea occurred during dose escalation and decreased over time.

The following gastrointestinal adverse reactions were reported more frequently in MOUNJARO-treated patients than placebo-treated patients (frequencies listed, respectively, as: placebo; 5 mg; 10 mg; 15 mg): eructation (0.4%, 3.0%, 2.5%, 3.3%), flatulence (0%, 1.3%, 2.5%, 2.9%), gastroesophageal reflux disease (0.4%, 1.7%, 2.5%, 1.7%), abdominal distension (0.4%, 0.4%, 2.9%, 0.8%).

Hypoglycemia

Table 2 summarizes the incidence of hypoglycemic events in the placebo-controlled trials.

Hypoglycemia was more frequent when MOUNJARO was used in combination with a sulfonylurea [see Clinical Studies (14)]. In a clinical trial up to 104 weeks of treatment, when administered with a sulfonylurea, hypoglycemia (glucose level < 54 mg/dL) occurred in 13.8%, 9.9%, and 12.8%, and severe hypoglycemia occurred in 0.5%, 0%, and 0.6% of patients treated with MOUNJARO 5 mg, 10 mg, and 15 mg, respectively.

Acute Pancreatitis

In clinical studies, 14 events of acute pancreatitis were confirmed by adjudication in 13 MOUNJARO-treated patients (0.23 patients per 100 years of exposure) versus 3 events in 3 comparator-treated patients (0.11 patients per 100 years of exposure).

Safety and Tolerability of Tirzepatide

Since tirzepatide is a dual GIP/GLP-1 agonist, the side effect profile is comparable to that of a GLP-1 receptor agonist. The most frequently observed side effects were related to the gastrointestinal (GI) system and nausea, diarrhoea and vomiting were the most common adverse events. The incidence of GI adverse events was 23.1% for 1 mg, 32.7% for 5 mg, 51.0% for 10 mg and 66.0% for 15 mg, demonstrating a dose-dependent behaviour (versus 42.6% for dulaglutide and 9.8% for placebo). The second most common adverse effect was reduced appetite, the incidence ranging from 3.8% to 18.9% in tirzepatide-treated groups. Study drug discontinuation due to adverse events was greater with the higher dose of tirzepatide (25% with the 15 mg group, 9.1% with the 10 mg group and 5.1% with the 5 mg group); the discontinuation rate for dulaglutide was 11.1%.

The titration-regimen trial also demonstrated the dose-dependent incidence of GI adverse events: 48.3%, 57.1% and 46.4% in the tirzepatide 12 mg, 15 mg-1 and 15 mg-2 groups, respectively, and 11.5% with placebo. Prevalence of study drug discontinuation due to adverse events was 3.4% (1 patient), 3.6% (1 patient), no patient and 3.8% (1 patient) in the tirzepatide 12 mg, 15 mg-1, 15 mg-2 and placebo groups, respectively. These findings contrasted with those of the 26-week phase 2 clinical trial where a greater prevalence of study drug discontinuation occurred in the higher dose group. The study authors suggested that a lower starting dose and small subsequent dose increments were associated with lower incidence of GI adverse events.

As originally reported in the SURPASS J studies, TEAEs were more frequent in the tirzepatide 10-mg and 15-mg groups, compared with the 5-mg group, and were most commonly gastrointestinal symptoms of mild severity (Table 2). The proportion of participants reporting any TEAE (82.1–91.7% vs. 73.3–81.9%) and any gastrointestinal TEAE (58.2–59.2% vs. 40.9–54.0%) trended slightly higher in the ≥ 5% weight-loss subgroup compared to the < 5% weight-loss subgroup. Nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting were the most frequent TEAEs reported across the SURPASS clinical program. Of these, the incidence proportion of nausea and vomiting were slightly higher in the ≥ 5% weight-loss subgroup, whereas diarrhea events occurred at a similar frequency across the weight-loss subgroups (Table 2). Study drug discontinuations due to adverse events were numerically higher in the ≥ 5% weight-loss subgroup (7.0–16.7%) compared with the < 5% weight-loss subgroup (3.1–6.2%) (Table 2).

### Efficacy and tolerability of tirzepatide, a dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist in patients with type 2 diabetes: a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate different dose-escalation regimens [^116h1f9d]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

This study, as well as the previously published phase 2b study, 20 support that dual agonism may have the potential to significantly affect the type 2 diabetes and obesity pandemic. 22 The efficacy data in this study showed efficacy consistent with the primary phase 2b study with comparable reductions in HbA1c and weight loss at the 12‐week time point (Figure S1A, B). This consistency of the data is reassuring and increases the probability that similar results may be observed in the phase 3 studies.

Key to the phase 3 development plan was to determine the optimal dose to balance benefit against potential GI side effects by choosing a dose‐escalation regimen that minimizes side effects and maximizes efficacy. Although the 5 and 10 mg doses of tirzepatide previously showed a comparable GI side effect profile with dulaglutide in the phase 2b study despite no or a short 2‐week dose escalation, there were high rates of treatment discontinuation because of AEs in the 15 mg dose group, and more patients in this group reported GI AEs compared with the other groups (Figure S1C). 20 This dose‐escalation study showed that a numerical reduction of GI side effects compared with the 15 mg group of the phase 2b study 20 could be achieved in all dose‐escalation regimens by starting at a lower dose and by prolonging the dose‐escalation period to 8 weeks, resulting in treatment discontinuation rates in all tirzepatide treatment groups that were similar or better than placebo. The rate of discontinuations because of AEs was very low and only a few moderate and no severe GI AEs were reported. However, the data suggest that the GI tolerability profile could be further improved. The GI AE data were assessed by numerical comparisons of incidences of nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea using the following approaches: (1) differences between the doses used at the initiation of therapy (2.5 or 4 mg); (2) differences across different escalation steps (2.5, 4, 5 or 7.5 mg); and (3) differences between the two 15 mg groups during the entire 12‐week treatment period (or overall) to support the dose‐escalation regimen being used in the phase 3 tirzepatide programme (SURPASS). The assessment of the by‐week incidence and prevalence of these GI events showed that initiation of tirzepatide treatment with lower doses and using smaller dose‐escalation increments resulted in a lower incidence of nausea, diarrhoea and vomiting.

2.2 Clinical study design and participants

This phase 1, randomized, placebo‐controlled, participant‐ and investigator‐blinded study comprised three parts: a single‐ascending dose and a 4‐week multiple‐ascending dose study in healthy participants, followed by a 4‐week multiple‐dose phase 1b proof‐of‐concept in participants with T2DM. 5 Evaluation of GE was incorporated within the multiple‐ascending dose and proof‐of‐concept parts of the study. Participants were randomly assigned to receive tirzepatide, dulaglutide 1.5 mg (healthy participants only) or placebo (Figure S1 in Appendix S1). The study design is described in the Appendix S1. The primary variables for analysis were maximum concentration (C max), area under the concentration versus time curve from time 0 to the last time point with a measurable concentration (AUC 0–tlast), and time to C max (T max) of acetaminophen (APAP). A comparison of APAP pharmacokinetics on day −1 (prior to study drug) and following first and fourth dose of study drug was summarized. The trial (: NCT02759107) was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, the Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences International Ethical Guidelines, and the International Conference on Harmonisation Good Clinical Practices Guideline. Local institutional review boards approved the protocol.

2.3 Study objectives

Gastric emptying was evaluated 2 hours post‐meal as the percent of food retained in the stomach as a fraction of the amount of food given to DIO mice treated with long‐acting GLP‐1RA semaglutide, long‐acting GIPRA, or dual GIP and GLP‐1RA tirzepatide.

Gastric emptying was evaluated following treatment with tirzepatide versus dulaglutide and placebo in humans.

1.2 Dosing and administration

The preclinical characterization, clinical pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of tirzepatide are presented in the Panel. Tirzepatide pharmacokinetics were similar in participants with renal impairment (lowest estimated glomerular filtration rate category: end stage renal disease (ESRD)) or hepatic [up to severe (class C) on Child‐Pugh score] impairment compared with healthy subjects, indicating that dose adjustment may not be required for these groups. Tirzepatide also delays gastric emptying with this effect diminishing over time. An approximate 20% reduction in the overall exposure of oral contraceptives was observed following the administration of a single 5 mg dose of tirzepatide. These results were observed in a study conducted at a point where the effect on gastric emptying was maximal, namely following a single 5 mg dose. This study reflects the effect of a single 5 mg dose of tirzepatide on oral contraceptive absorption and does not take into account tachyphylaxis observed with repeated dosing. A gastric emptying delay is also observed in patients taking other GLP‐1 receptor agonists and the effect diminishes over time. The dosing recommendation for tirzepatide is to initiate treatment at 2.5 mg and escalate in 2.5 mg doses at 4‐week intervals.

3.2 Gastrointestinal adverse events

As expected from the GLP‐1 receptor agonist class, gastrointestinal adverse events (including nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea) occurred; their incidence was similar to those in the semaglutide 1‐mg group of the SUSTAIN programme. In SURPASS‐2, with direct comparison with semaglutide 1 mg, gastrointestinal adverse events (40%‐46% vs. 41%), nausea (17%‐22% vs. 18%), vomiting (6%‐10% vs. 8%) and diarrhoea (13%‐16% vs. 12%) were reported for participants on tirzepatide and semaglutide 1 mg. As shown in time‐course plots (Figure 5), most events were mild or moderate in severity and occurred more frequently in the dose‐escalation phase in all groups. In SURPASS‐4 (a population with a relatively long duration of diabetes, high background medication use, high number of comorbidities and the longest follow‐up period) nausea was reported in 12%‐23% on tirzepatide and 2% on insulin glargine 100 U/ml; vomiting in 5%‐9% and 2%; and diarrhoea in 13%‐22% and 4%, respectively. Gastrointestinal side effects were also reported more frequently than insulin glargine 100 U/ml with GLP‐1 receptor agonists. Consistent with the low rate of study treatment discontinuation, ≤ 3% of participants who received at least one dose of tirzepatide discontinued treatment because of either nausea, vomiting or diarrhoea (Table S1).,

Discussion

In this meta-analysis, among the 28 trials analyzed, tirzepatide at doses of 5 mg, 10 mg, and 15 mg demonstrated the most significant HbA1c reduction and weight loss, aligning with the findings by Ding et al. As the first dual agonist of GIP and GLP-1 receptors, tirzepatide employs a dual-target mechanism that enables stronger hypoglycemic and weight-reducing effects than other existing hypoglycemic agents, with high tolerability and safety. These qualities underscore its value in comprehensive diabetes management.

Obesity and type 2 diabetes share a fundamental pathophysiological mechanism. Research indicates that a weight reduction of 15% or greater can markedly enhance blood sugar regulation in individuals with diabetes, with some attaining a state of "remission" that is not achievable through alternative hypoglycemic treatments. The incretin hormones glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) regulate blood sugar levels, and tirzepatide targets both GIP and GLP-1 receptors. This dual action helps regulate insulin secretion through GLP-1, delays gastric emptying to reduce appetite, and inhibits gastric acid secretion and motility via GIP, offering an appetite-suppressing effect while potentially preserving islet function.

This study indicates that tirzepatide, particularly at doses of 15 mg and 10 mg, shows a higher likelihood of adverse events (AEs) compared to other medications. Tirzepatide 5 mg, however, is associated with a higher probability of serious adverse events (SAEs). Gastrointestinal reactions, such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, are the main AEs of tirzepatide and align with those observed with GLP-1 receptor agonists. In our analysis, liraglutide 1.8 mg has the highest probability of AEs, underscoring a consideration for clinicians when choosing hypoglycemic agents, as hypoglycemia risk is a significant concern. For instance, although insulin effectively lowers blood glucose, its hypoglycemic risk limits its use. In contrast, tirzepatide has a remarkably low hypoglycemia risk when used alone, as indicated by its action mechanism and existing research. This low risk enhances confidence in tirzepatide's use for blood sugar control, contributing to high compliance with HbA1c targets in the tirzepatide group.

3.3.3 Relationship between the therapeutic efficacy of incretin mimetic agents and

ORs for each GI AE were plotted against each primary efficacy endpoint to assess correlations across agents and doses (Figure 3). Although some variability in ORs for GI AEs was observed, the overall range was similar across incretin mimetics, regardless of efficacy. Thus, the inspection of Figure 3 suggests that the ORs for adverse events are more or less stacked one above the other on the x ‐axis, with some variation mainly reflecting the dose–response relationships (Figure 2), while the effect sizes are widely spread along the y ‐axis. Linear regression analysis showed weak, but nominally significant associations between ORs for nausea and reductions in HbA1c, FPG and body weight (Figure 3A–C), as well as between ORs for vomiting and reductions in body weight (Figure 3F). However, the magnitude of these correlations was small, with r 2 values < 0.016 and often < 0.0001, indicating that GI AEs accounted for less than 1.6% of the variance in efficacy outcomes. Notably, data points representing highly efficacious incretin mimetics, such as s.c. and p.o. semaglutide and tirzepatide, consistently plotted farthest from the regression lines towards the lower‐left quadrant in Figure 3.

Results

Patient Demographics

The baseline characteristics and demographics of patients in the SURPASS-1 to -5 clinical trials were described in detail in the respective study publications and, within each study, baseline characteristics were similar across treatment arms. The baseline characteristics and demographics of patients pooled by study are summarised in Table S1 (in the supplementary material).

AEs

Summary data on any AEs leading to study treatment discontinuation and specific gastrointestinal AEs of interest (nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea) of any severity in SURPASS-1 to -5 are included in Table S2. Any AEs leading to study treatment discontinuation were reported by 3–11% of patients who received tirzepatide across these studies, compared with placebo (3%), semaglutide 1 mg (4%), basal insulins (1–5%) and placebo with background insulin (3%). Nausea, vomiting or diarrhoea of any severity occurred in 2–24%, 1–13% and 4–22% of patients, respectively, across all treatment groups in all SURPASS-1 to -5 studies (Table S2). Consistent with the low rate of study treatment discontinuation, at most 3% of patients who received at least one dose of tirzepatide in SURPASS-1 to -5 discontinued treatment because of nausea, vomiting or diarrhoea.

The impact of long‐acting incretin receptor agonists on GE was assessed as an exploratory measure within a phase 1 study of limited sample size. The study duration was 4 weeks, during which tirzepatide was rapidly escalated from 5 mg (the maximum tolerated dose as a single dose 5), to 10 or 15 mg in the 5/5/10/10 and 5/5/10/15 mg cohorts. This limited duration did not permit evaluation of the steady‐state effects of tirzepatide on GE delay, especially at the 10‐ and 15‐mg doses. Nevertheless, although we were able to observe tachyphylaxis of GE delay at a fixed 5‐mg dose, complete tachyphylaxis of GE delay within 4 weeks was not observed for the 5/5/10/10 or 5/5/10/15 mg cohorts. Longer‐duration studies may be required to gain a better understanding on GE delay in relation to tachyphylaxis with tirzepatide. Studies with short‐acting GLP‐1RAs have shown residual effects on GE with long‐term treatment. 16

The treatment effect on GE delay may be influenced by the type of test used. In this study, we used an APAP test following an oral glucose tolerance test, as opposed to 'gold standard' methodology, such as scintigraphy or breath tests, to evaluate the impact of increasing dose levels and dose escalation schemes of dual GIP and GLP‐1RA tirzepatide on GE within the context of a multiple‐ascending dose study. This design allowed us to also compare the impact of a dual GIP and GLP‐1RA versus a GLP‐1RA. The technical complexities of scintigraphy and breath tests would limit such investigations within a phase 1 multiple‐ascending dose clinical study and would require an additional stand‐alone mechanism of action GE study. Future studies may be needed to assess the effect of tirzepatide on GE following a solid meal.

In conclusion, these data suggest that the novel dual GIP and GLP‐1RA tirzepatide has similar effects on GE delay when compared with selective GLP‐1RA. GE delay is not the key driver for tirzepatide‐induced postprandial glycaemic efficacy and weight loss.

Aims

To evaluate gastrointestinal adverse events (AEs) and the impact of nausea, vomiting or diarrhoea (N/V/D) and any gastrointestinal (GI) AEs overall on weight change with tirzepatide across the SURPASS-1 to -5 clinical trials.

Materials and Methods

Participants with type 2 diabetes were randomized to receive once-weekly tirzepatide (5, 10 or 15mg) or comparator (placebo, semaglutide 1mg once weekly, or titrated daily basal insulins) as monotherapy or added on to background antihyperglycaemic medication(s). This post hoc analysis subdivided participants within each trial into subgroups that self-reported (yes/no) any N/V/D or GI AEs. Change from baseline in body weight at the primary timepoint was assessed within each trial and subgroup. Mediation analyses were conducted to evaluate the contribution of direct and indirect (mediated by N/V/D or GI AEs) effects of tirzepatide on weight change versus comparators.

Results

Across the SURPASS-1 to -5 trials (N = 6263), nausea (12%-24%), diarrhoea (12%-22%), and vomiting (2%-13%) were the most common GI AEs reported with tirzepatide; these were transient and of mild-to-moderate severity. Mean weight reduction at the primary timepoint with tirzepatide was consistent between participants who reported N/V/D (-6.2 to -14.9kg) and those who did not report N/V/D (-6.2 to -13.3kg). Mean weight reduction was significantly (P < 0.01) greater with tirzepatide compared with placebo, semaglutide 1mg, and basal insulins within the N/V/D and GI AEs subgroups. Mediation analyses suggested minimal contribution (< 6%) of N/V/D and GI AEs to the overall difference in weight change between tirzepatide and comparators.

Conclusions

Superior weight reduction with tirzepatide versus comparators appears to be independent of reported N/V/D or GI AEs.

Common adverse events and side effects

Tirzepatide may cause common side effects in irritable bowel syndrome, such as diarrhea, constipation, nausea, vomiting, upper abdominal discomfort, decreased appetite, and abdominal pain. This might suggest that tirzepatide affects the gut microbiota. Numerous gastrointestinal conditions, such as irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, and small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, have been associated with dysbiosis (an imbalance or disruption in the composition and diversity of the gut microbiome). According to research, modifying the gut microbiota can impact various physiological functions, including cognitive behavior and muscle performance. The potential relationship between tirzepatide and the gut microbiome is not fully understood, making it an appealing area of study. Understanding these interactions could provide insight into the mechanisms behind tirzepatide's metabolic benefits and inform future strategies for improving its efficacy and minimizing side effects. During the phase 3 trial of tirzepatide, 6.6% of patients discontinued the medication due to side effects. Furthermore, pancreatitis or cholelithiasis patients should use tirzepatide with caution.

Native GLP-1 and Gastric Emptying

Acute IV administration of GLP- 1 slows gastric emptying profoundly and dose-dependently, accompanied by relaxation of the gastric fundus, increased gastric compliance, inhibition of antral contractility, and increased pyloric tone. This dose-dependent slowing of gastric emptying represents a major mechanism contributing to PPG lowering by exogenous GLP-1 and, in healthy humans, "outweighs" its insulinotropic effects such that postprandial insulin secretory responses are suppressed rather than stimulated. Not surprisingly, a specific GLP-1 receptor antagonist, exendin [9–39] amide, accelerates gastric emptying in individuals without diabetes with proportional rises in plasma glucose and insulin, indicating that physiological postprandial concentrations of GLP-1 are sufficient to slow gastric emptying substantially.

The observation that IV GLP-1 leads to a reduction in plasma glucose after a meal in individuals with T2D, while a rise in plasma glucose was observed after subsequent meals, suggested there may be tachyphylaxis for the effects of GLP-1 to slow gastric emptying. Nauck et al evaluated the effect of exogenous IV GLP-1 (7–36 amide), delivered at 0.8 pmol.kg −1. l −1 for 8 hours, on gastric emptying (by a dye dilution technique) of 2 successive meals consumed at baseline and after 4 hours of GLP-1 exposure. Both acute and 4-hour exposure to GLP-1 slowed gastric emptying markedly, but the degree of deceleration was less for the second meal. Subsequently, Umapathysivam et al compared the effects of acute, intermittent (2 4.5-hour infusions separated by 20 hours) and continuous (20 hours) IV GLP-1 (0.8 pmol.kg −1. min −1) with placebo on gastric emptying (with scintigraphy, the gold-standard measurement) in a double-blind crossover study in healthy humans. Both acute and intermittent exposure were shown to slow gastric emptying potently and comparably. Although still substantial, the slowing of emptying was diminished with continuous exposure. Taken together, these observations suggest that a reduction in the deceleration of gastric emptying may occur even within 4 hours of administration of exogenous GLP-1RAs.

Do Slower Gastric Emptying and Greater Gastric Distension With GLP-1RAs Contribute to a Reduction in Energy Intake?

In individuals without diabetes, sensations of bloating/fullness are more closely associated with emptying from the distal stomach and antral area as measured by ultrasound. There is limited information about the effect of GLP-1RAs on intragastric meal distribution. In individuals with and without T2D, the marked slowing of gastric emptying induced by an acute dose of lixisenatide (10 µg) is associated with increased retention in both the proximal and distal stomach. In this study, subsequent energy intake at a buffet meal was related to the retention in the distal stomach during placebo in healthy human subjects, an effect not observed in T2D or after lixisenatide. The lack of a relationship between energy intake and changes in gastric emptying and intragastric distribution in individuals treated with lixisenatide is consistent with the concept that effects on appetite are primarily centrally mediated. Similarly, no correlation between gastric emptying (measured using the isotope breath test) and energy intake was found in a separate trial. Accordingly, a possible mechanism of action of GLP-1 RAs to reduce appetite and energy intake may involve interaction with neurons in the hypothalamus either directly or via the nodose ganglion, rather than a secondary consequence of slowing gastric emptying.

### Tirzepatide, a dual GIP / GLP-1 receptor co-agonist for the treatment of type 2 diabetes with unmatched effectiveness regrading glycaemic control and body weight reduction [^115oh8ff]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2022). Medium credibility.

Tirzepatide is the first dual GIP/GLP-1 receptor co-agonist approved for the treatment of type 2 diabetes in the United States, Europe, and the UAE. Tirzepatide is an acylated peptide engineered to activate the GIP and GLP-1 receptors, key mediators of insulin secretion that are also expressed in regions of the brain that regulate food intake. Five clinical trials in type 2-diabetic subjects (SURPASS 1–5) have shown that tirzepatide at 5–15 mg per week reduces both HbA 1c (1.24 to 2.58%) and body weight (5.4–11.7 kg) by amounts unprecedented for a single agent. A sizable proportion of patients (23.0 to 62.4%) reached an HbA 1c of < 5.7% (which is the upper limit of the normal range indicating normoglycaemia), and 20.7 to 68.4% lost more than 10% of their baseline body weight. Tirzepatide was significantly more effective in reducing HbA 1c and body weight than the selective GLP-1 RA semaglutide (1.0 mg per week), and titrated basal insulin. Adverse events related to tirzepatide were similar to what has been reported for selective GLP-1RA, mainly nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, and constipation, that were more common at higher doses. Cardiovascular events have been adjudicated across the whole study program, and MACE-4 (nonfatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, cardiovascular death and hospital admission for angina) events tended to be reduced over up to a 2 year-period, albeit with low numbers of events. For none of the cardiovascular events analysed (MACE-4, or its components) was a hazard ratio > 1.0 vs. pooled comparators found in a meta-analysis covering the whole clinical trial program, and the upper bounds of the confidence intervals for MACE were < 1.3, fulfilling conventional definitions of cardiovascular safety. Tirzepatide was found to improve insulin sensitivity and insulin secretory responses to a greater extent than semaglutide, and this was associated with lower prandial insulin and glucagon concentrations. Both drugs caused similar reductions in appetite, although tirzepatide caused greater weight loss. While the clinical effects of tirzepatide have been very encouraging, important questions remain as to the mechanism of action. While GIP reduces food intake and body weight in rodents, these effects have not been demonstrated in humans. Moreover, it remains to be shown that GIPR agonism can improve insulin secretion in type 2 diabetic patients who have been noted in previous studies to be unresponsive to GIP. Certainly, the apparent advantage of tirzepatide, a dual incretin agonist, over GLP-1RA will spark renewed interest in the therapeutic potential of GIP in type 2 diabetes, obesity and related co-morbidities.

### Efficacy and tolerability of tirzepatide, a dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist in patients with type 2 diabetes: a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate different dose-escalation regimens [^111rWCU8]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

One emerging approach to improve the efficacy of GLP‐1 RAs is a pharmacological strategy targeting additional pathways implicated in nutrient and energy metabolism, such as glucose‐dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP). 11 GIP is responsible for majority of the postprandial insulinotropic incretin effect in normal individuals 12 and has important additional functions that are distinct from GLP‐1. GIP plays an important role in adipose tissue carbohydrate and lipid metabolism by its actions to regulate glucose uptake, 13 lipolysis, 13, 14 and lipoprotein lipase activity. 14 In the brain, GIP appears to activate neurons distinct from GLP‐1, and intracerebroventricular administration of GIP in mice can inhibit food intake in a manner that is additive to GLP‐1. 15 GIP agonism, at least in short infusion studies, has not shown gastrointestinal (GI) side effects in humans. 16 In fact, GIP receptor activation may have antiemetic effects, as described in a recent patent application. 17 Thus, GIP could contribute to the efficacy of GLP‐1 RAs by a complementary metabolic mechanism without worsening GI tolerability, resulting in an improved therapeutic window of the dual agonism compared with selective GLP‐1R agonism. In participants with type 2 diabetes, a multiple‐dose, dose‐escalation study with a pegylated peptide having balanced co‐agonism at both GIP and GLP‐1 receptors showed clinically relevant glucose reduction, with low incidence of GI side effects, supporting that the therapeutic window might be broader than that of a selective GLP‐1 RA. 18

Abstract

The effect of dual glucose‐dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon‐like peptide‐1 (GLP‐1) receptor agonist (RA) tirzepatide on gastric emptying (GE) was compared to that of GLP‐1RAs in non‐clinical and clinical studies. GE was assessed following acute and chronic treatment with tirzepatide in diet‐induced obese mice versus semaglutide or long‐acting GIP analogue alone. Participants [with and without type 2 diabetes (T2DM)] from a phase 1, 4‐week multiple dose study received tirzepatide, dulaglutide or placebo. GE was assessed by acetaminophen absorption. In mice, tirzepatide delayed GE to a similar degree to that achieved with semaglutide; however, these acute inhibitory effects were abolished after 2 weeks of treatment. GIP analogue alone had no effect on GE or on GLP‐1's effect on GE. In participants with and without T2DM, once‐weekly tirzepatide (≥ 5 and ≥ 4.5 mg, respectively) delayed GE after a single dose. This effect diminished after multiple doses of tirzepatide or dulaglutide in healthy participants. In participants with T2DM treated with an escalation schedule of tirzepatide 5/5/10/10 or 5/5/10/15 mg, a residual GE delay was still observed after multiple doses. These data suggest that tirzepatide's activity on GE is comparable to that of selective GLP‐1RAs.

### The new dual gastric inhibitory peptide / glucagon-like peptide 1 agonist tirzepatide in type 2 diabetes: is the future bright? [^112X3TUk]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Tirzepatide is a dual gastric inhibitory peptide/glucagon-like peptide 1 (GIP/GLP-1) receptor agonist formulated as a synthetic linear peptide, based on the native GIP sequence. It has a prolonged half-life of 5 days, which enables once-weekly dosing. Studies have hitherto demonstrated its superiority in achieving optimal glycaemic control and body weight management, as compared with various agents used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), including GLP-1 receptor agonists. Thus, it is expected to enrich our therapeutic armamentarium in T2DM. However, further experience, notably longer follow-up data and information on cardiovascular effects, is still needed.

### Comparative efficacy and tolerability of currently approved incretin mimetics: a systematic analysis of placebo-controlled clinical trials [^112X8TYx]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

This meta‐analysis of 38 randomized clinical trials, involving over 16 000 participants with T2D, demonstrated that newer incretin mimetics, particularly s.c. semaglutide and tirzepatide, provide greater reductions in HbA1c, FPG and body weight compared with earlier‐generation GLP‐1 RAs such as exenatide and lixisenatide. Despite their enhanced therapeutic efficacy, however, the incidence of GI AEs — specifically nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea — was not proportionally higher, suggesting that there is no strong relationship coupling larger desired therapeutic efficacy to significantly more GI AEs.

These findings build on previous evidence from head‐to‐head comparisons, and network meta‐analyses, that demonstrated the superior efficacy of newer incretin mimetics. However, while prior studies noted an increased risk of GI AEs across all incretin‐based glucose‐lowering agents examined, the present analysis additionally demonstrates that the magnitude of therapeutic efficacy does not scale linearly with the effect size regarding therapeutic benefits. The overall ORs for nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea were 3.42, 4.07 and 1.83, respectively, with dose–response relationships observed within some agents but without substantial variability across compounds. Furthermore, regression analyses indicated that GI AEs accounted for less than 1.6% of the variability in efficacy outcomes, with highly efficacious agents such as semaglutide and tirzepatide exhibiting lower AE rates than expected based on their therapeutic efficacy.

### The novel dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist tirzepatide transiently delays gastric emptying similarly to selective long-acting GLP-1 receptor agonists [^113LanR1]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

In our clinical studies, we found that tirzepatide's effect on GE was comparable to that of the selective GLP‐1RA dulaglutide in healthy participants. In participants with T2DM, GE delay was observed following the first dose of tirzepatide 5 mg, but after 4 weeks of repeated dosing there was evidence of tachyphylaxis. However, after four weekly doses of 5/5/10/10 or 5/5/10/15 mg, GE delay, while diminished, was still apparent following the last dose.

Under similar experimental conditions, GE delay observed with tirzepatide and dulaglutide was comparable, thereby suggesting that the delay was driven by GLP‐1RA and the GIP agonism did not seem to contribute to this effect.

Although the GE effect showed near‐complete tachyphylaxis using the 5‐mg dose, the effect on postprandial glucose (self‐monitored blood glucose) was maintained following multiple 5‐mg doses. 5 It has also been shown that the impact of the 5‐mg dose on weight loss continues beyond 4 weeks (−4.8 kg at 26 weeks vs. −2.5 kg at 4 weeks). 6 This suggests that the attenuation of postprandial glycaemic rises, in the longer term, must be explained by other mechanisms over and above the waning effects on GE. 1, 2, 13, 14 These results are aligned with a prior report by Jelsing et al. 4 who demonstrated the importance of GLP‐1‐mediated GE delay in the immediate (ie, acute) regulation of food intake or glucose control. However, GLP‐1's effect on GE undergoes tachyphylaxis with chronic treatment but does not lead to a direct loss of glucose control or body weight effect, thereby demonstrating GLP‐1's differential regulation of metabolism.

### Clinical consequences of delayed gastric emptying with GLP-1 receptor agonists and tirzepatide [^1169ZKUH]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

After sustained exposure to long-acting GLP-1RAs, tachyphylaxis for the effects on gastric emptying has been observed. Nevertheless, residual slowing of gastric emptying remains, for example with liraglutide (1.8 mg per day) after 4 weeks or exenatide once weekly (2 mg) after 8 weeks, (Figs. 1 and 2.) Clinical studies evaluating the effects of GLP-1RA treatment for periods of up to 21 weeks (the longest period reported so far) on gastric emptying are summarized in Supplementary Table S1 and displayed as Fig. 2. Linear regression analysis did not illustrate a reduction over time in the effects of short-acting GLP-1RAs twice-a-day exenatide and lixisenatide on gastric emptying, while with long-acting GLP-1RAs (liraglutide, exenatide once a week, semaglutide SC and oral, and efpeglenatide), there appears to be a decline in the magnitude of this slowing over time. The fact that the effect sizes overall appear to be greater for short- vs long-acting GLP-1RAs may, in part, reflect the presence of tachyphylaxis with long- but not with short-acting formulations. To what degree the effects of long-acting GLP-1RAs on gastric emptying persist over durations longer than, eg, 16 weeks and how this affects postprandial glucose lowering cannot be answered based on the available data and needs to be studied.

Interindividual Variation Regarding Tachyphylaxis of Gastric Emptying Effect of GLP-1 RAs

Effects of liraglutide (3 mg per day) on gastric emptying of a mixed meal in individuals with obesity has been studied at baseline and after 5 as well as 16 weeks. Mean gastric half-emptying times are prolonged after 5 weeks of treatment but significantly less so after 16 weeks. However, a secondary analysis of the same data shows substantial interindividual variability in the effects of liraglutide on gastric emptying and regarding the temporal pattern of effects of this long-acting GLP-1 RA.

### Older adults: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^1134EnJ1]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) and tirzepatide — use in older adults with diabetes includes tolerability and monitoring considerations as well as efficacy data. These drugs are injectable agents (with the exception of oral semaglutide (124)), which require visual, motor, and cognitive skills for appropriate administration, although most of them have a weekly dosing schedule, and GLP-1 RAs may also be associated with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or constipation and should be titrated slowly. Given the gastrointestinal side effects of this class, GLP-1 RAs are not preferred in older adults experiencing unexplained weight loss or undernutrition or in those who have recurrent gastrointestinal problems, and individuals should be monitored regularly for excessive weight loss. Tirzepatide is a novel dual-acting glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide and GLP-1 RA administered as a once-weekly subcutaneous injection; in phase 3 trials, tirzepatide decreased A1C and weight — generally to a greater extent than other glucose-lowering drugs including semaglutide and insulin — with no significant differences in the safety or efficacy in older compared with younger individuals (125), and as the adverse effect profile of tirzepatide is similar to that for GLP-1 RAs, the same precautions for older adults apply. Sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are administered orally, which may be convenient for older adults with diabetes, and in those with established ASCVD these agents have shown cardiovascular benefits.

4 DISCUSSION

Gastric emptying is one of the critical factors affecting postprandial glycaemia and food intake, which is a complex interplay involving gastric, intestinal and central neuronal and humoral mechanisms. 11 The role of GLP‐1 in GE has been intensively studied. 12 Research on GIP and its effect in GE is limited. Native GIP mimicking postprandial GIP blood levels and GIPRAs did not reveal any relevant effects on GE. 3, 13, 14, 15 In the present study, we investigated whether a dual GIP and GLP‐1RA had any impact on GE and if the combination of GIP and GLP‐1 could enhance the known GLP‐1RA effects on GE in non‐clinical and clinical settings.

In the absence of any available GIPRAs for clinical use, we first studied the effect of long‐acting GIPRA versus GLP‐1RAs in mice. Long‐acting GIPRA had no effect on GE at pharmacological levels. As expected, long‐acting GLP‐1RA profoundly inhibited GE. Additionally, increasing concentrations of long‐acting GIPRA on top of GLP‐1RAs did not cause further GE delay, thereby clearly highlighting that GLP‐1 was the main driver of decelerating GE. The extent of GE delay with acute tirzepatide treatment did not differ from that of long‐acting GLP‐1RA. Sustained exposure to GLP‐1RA (via tirzepatide or using selective GLP‐1RA, semaglutide) resulted in tachyphylaxis of the GE effect in mice, as demonstrated in previous studies. 3, 4

1 INTRODUCTION

Glucagon‐like peptide‐1 (GLP‐1) and glucose‐dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) are the two known incretins that enhance glucose‐stimulated insulin secretion after nutrient ingestion. GLP‐1 receptor agonists (GLP‐1RAs) affect glucose homeostasis by stimulating insulin secretion, suppressing glucagon, slowing gastric emptying (GE), and enhancing satiety to reduce food intake. 1 The magnitude of effect on GE, unlike the effects on glycaemic control or appetite, is attenuated with prolonged GLP‐1 exposure. 2, 3, 4 While GIP is the main incretin that stimulates glucose‐dependent insulin secretion and affects postprandial fat metabolism, it has no known impact on GE. 2, 3, 4

The novel dual GIP and GLP‐1RA tirzepatide has a mean half‐life of ~5 days, supporting once‐weekly dosing. 5 In patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM), tirzepatide demonstrated potent effects on both fasting and postprandial glycaemia and insulin response during an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). 5 In patients with T2DM from a phase 2b study, tirzepatide showed superior efficacy in glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) and body weight reduction compared with dulaglutide (up to −25.4 mmol/mol vs. −13.7 mmol/mol and − 11.3 vs. −2.7 kg, respectively). 6

The GE rate is a major determinant of postprandial glycaemic excursions in both healthy participants and in participants with T2DM 7, 8 and has been linked to suppression of food intake and weight loss. 9 Potentially, the robust glycaemic‐lowering observed with tirzepatide could be partially attributable to its prolonged inhibitory effect on GE. 6

We investigated the GE effect of the long‐acting dual GIP and GLP‐1RA tirzepatide versus selective GLP‐1RAs in non‐clinical and clinical studies and the potential consequences for its glycaemic efficacy.

The effect of dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist (RA) tirzepatide on gastric emptying (GE) was compared to that of GLP-1RAs in non-clinical and clinical studies. GE was assessed following acute and chronic treatment with tirzepatide in diet-induced obese mice versus semaglutide or long-acting GIP analogue alone. Participants [with and without type 2 diabetes (T2DM)] from a phase 1, 4-week multiple dose study received tirzepatide, dulaglutide or placebo. GE was assessed by acetaminophen absorption. In mice, tirzepatide delayed GE to a similar degree to that achieved with semaglutide; however, these acute inhibitory effects were abolished after 2 weeks of treatment. GIP analogue alone had no effect on GE or on GLP-1's effect on GE. In participants with and without T2DM, once-weekly tirzepatide (≥ 5 and ≥ 4.5 mg, respectively) delayed GE after a single dose. This effect diminished after multiple doses of tirzepatide or dulaglutide in healthy participants. In participants with T2DM treated with an escalation schedule of tirzepatide 5/5/10/10 or 5/5/10/15 mg, a residual GE delay was still observed after multiple doses. These data suggest that tirzepatide's activity on GE is comparable to that of selective GLP-1RAs.

Abbreviations: GLP-1, glucagon-like peptide-1; RA, receptor agonist.

Twice a day exenatide (5 vs 10 µg twice daily for 5 days) was shown to slow gastric emptying by scintigraphy in T2D in a dose-dependent manner, associated with a reduction in postmeal plasma glucose and peak insulin concentrations. The overall magnitude of both slowing of gastric emptying and glucose-lowering were marked but variable and dependent on the baseline rate of gastric emptying and less prominent in those with slow baseline gastric emptying. Furthermore, in a small scintigraphic study (n = 20), IV exenatide was shown to slow small intestinal transit with an associated attenuation in blood glucose rise in individuals with and without T2D. Similar analyses for lixisenatide and liraglutide confirm little further deceleration of gastric emptying in patients with abnormally delayed and even relatively slower gastric emptying at baseline (Fig. 2E). Lorenz et al reported slowing of gastric emptying, assessed by a stable isotope (13 C octanoic acid) breath test, following 4 weeks of treatment with lixisenatide, accompanied by a reduction in postprandial glucose excursions.

Lixisenatide's effects on gastric emptying of a liquid oral glucose load has been studied after a single SC dose of 10 µg per day and after 8 weeks of treating with 20 µg per day, both in inidividuals with and without T2D. Gastric emptying was markedly delayed under both conditions, irrespective of a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus. Remarkably, there were considerable interindividual differences regarding the effects of lixisenatide on gastric emptying, with some subjects experiencing only minimal gastric emptying over the study period, such that half-emptying times could not be determined. Thus, lixisenatide, as a representative of short-acting GLP-1 RAs, profoundly decelerated gastric emptying of a liquid meal, with little difference over time (single dose vs 8 weeks), supporting the absence of substantial tachyphylaxis.

### Comparative efficacy and tolerability of currently approved incretin mimetics: a systematic analysis of placebo-controlled clinical trials [^112s3SRJ]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Aims

This study compares the therapeutic efficacy, gastrointestinal (GI) adverse event (AE) rates and the relationship between the therapeutic efficacy and GI AEs in randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials (RCTs) of GLP-1 RAs and the dual GLP-1/GIP agonist tirzepatide.

Materials and Methods

A systematic PubMed search identified 38 phase 3 or 4 placebo-controlled RCTs of exenatide (b.i.d. and q.w.), lixisenatide, liraglutide, dulaglutide, albiglutide, semaglutide (s.c. and oral) and tirzepatide with a total of 16660 individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2D) across 104 study arms. Changes in HbA1c, fasting plasma glucose and body weight and the proportion of GI AEs (nausea, vomiting or diarrhoea) were calculated by agent, preparation and dose. The correlation between odds ratios (ORs) for GI AEs and the magnitude of therapeutic efficacy was assessed in a linear regression analysis.

Results

Baseline characteristics were similar across studies: mean age 57 ± 10years, diabetes duration 8 ± 6years, body mass index (BMI) 31.9 ± 5.8kg/m 2 and HbA1c 8.2% ± 0.9%. HbA1c reductions ranged from -0.63% ± 0.03% (lixisenatide, 20μg q.d.) to -1.79% ± 0.09% (tirzepatide, 15mg q.w.; p < 0.0001). Weight reductions ranged from -0.75 ± 0.10kg to -9.65 ± 0.56kg. Despite the high variability in therapeutic efficacy, ORs for GI AEs were similar across compounds/preparations.

Conclusions

The magnitude of efficacy for intended therapeutic actions (HbA1c and body weight reduction) varied widely between incretin mimetic glucose-lowering agents. However, larger therapeutic efficacy was not systematically associated with higher GI AE or drug discontinuation rates, indicating better tolerability of the more effective agents/preparations.

Table 3
By‐week combined incidence of nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea

The incidence of hypoglycaemic episodes (documented, symptomatic, probable and asymptomatic events) was low across all the tirzepatide treatment groups during the study. There were 12 patients who experienced at least one hypoglycaemic episode (plasma glucose ≤ 70 mg/dL [3.9 mmol/L]). It cannot be ruled out that one patient in the 15 mg‐2 group had a plasma glucose of < 54 mg/dL (3.0 mmol/L) because that patient reported a hypoglycaemia episode but did not report a plasma glucose value (Table 2). There were no reports of severe hypoglycaemia. There were no cases of investigator‐suspected pancreatitis or cholecystitis. No cardiovascular events that required adjudication occurred during the trial. There were no reports of thyroid tumours, neoplasms or C‐cell hyperplasia events. Pulse rate increased for the tirzepatide treatment groups (0.9 to 5.7 beats/min) and decreased in the placebo group (−2.3 beats/min) during the treatment period of the study.

Approximately 26% of patients treated with tirzepatide developed treatment‐emergent antidrug antibodies (TE‐ADAs). Overall titres were low and there were no effects because of the presence of TE‐ADAs on reduction of HbA1c, body weight or drug clearance. There were no hypersensitivity reactions or any other relevant AEs associated with the presence of TE‐ADAs.

AACE 2022 diabetes — tirzepatide for type 2 diabetes: Tirzepatide, a dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide and GLP-1 receptor agonist, is recently approved by the FDA for improvement in glycemic control in persons with type 2 diabetes.

Tirzepatide was associated with increased gastrointestinal adverse events but no increase in risk of hypoglycemia, appears useful for those already on metformin therapy, and based on early data and ongoing trials (including a cardiovascular outcomes trial) additional clinical indications for weight loss and/or cardiovascular risk reduction may be sought.

### Tirzepatide and cardiometabolic parameters in obesity: summary of current evidence [^1165d3nu]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Tirzepatide is a once‐weekly dual glucose‐dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and GLP‐1 receptor agonist, approved for the treatment of adults with type 2 diabetes (T2D), for weight management in adults with obesity or overweight with at least one weight‐related comorbid condition, and for obstructive sleep apnoea in adults with obesity. Tirzepatide exerts glucose‐lowering effects by activating both GIP and GLP‐1 receptors, potentially in a synergistic or additive manner, thereby augmenting glucose‐dependent insulin secretion and inhibiting glucagon release. Additionally, tirzepatide transiently delays gastric emptying, which may slow post‐meal glucose absorption and benefit postprandial glycaemia. Furthermore, by increasing feelings of satiety and fullness, tirzepatide results in decreased food intake and feelings of hunger, leading to appetite regulation and bodyweight reduction. Tirzepatide also reduces the intensity of food cravings and preferences for high‐calorie foods. In clinical trials, tirzepatide has demonstrated dose‐dependent efficacy in people with obesity, T2D or both, in terms of glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) level reduction and bodyweight reduction compared with placebo, GLP‐1 receptor agonists and basal insulin. In this narrative review, we summarize current evidence on the effects of tirzepatide on cardiometabolic parameters. We do so as evidence is changing rapidly, and collating the totality of the effects of tirzepatide on cardiometabolic parameters seen thus far is likely useful to some clinical and research communities.

### Semaglutide or tirzepatide and optic nerve and visual pathway disorders in type 2 diabetes [^113tGfv3]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA) medications have transformed the treatment of type 2 diabetes and obesity, with associated reductions in cardiovascular and nephrological complications. Semaglutide and tirzepatide are second-generation GLP-1RA medications approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of diabetes and obesity. The main associated adverse outcomes are gastrointestinal outcomes, including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, gastroparesis, and constipation. Studies also reported potential associations of GLP-1RAs with thyroid C-cell tumors and pancreatitis.

Nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION) is characterized by loss of vision caused by loss of blood flow to the optic nerve. Its prevalence is higher in patients with diabetes, obesity, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, cerebrovascular disease, and obstructive sleep apnea. Although the etiopathogenesis of NAION is not fully understood, decreased arterial perfusion of the optic nerve and the associated swelling and compression of the optic nerve are implicated. Several retrospective studies from 2024 and 2025 reported a potential association of semaglutide with NAION in patients with diabetes and patients with obesity. However, a meta-analysis of randomized clinical trialsdid not detect an association of GLP1-RA therapy, including semaglutide, with NAION. A rare condition, NAION has an incidence rate of 2.5 to 11.8 incidents per 100 000 individuals. These inconsistent findings may be due to limited sample sizes and different study designs. Importantly, it remains unknown if semaglutide or tirzepatide is associated with other optic nerve and visual pathway disorders. This study leveraged a nationwide, multicenter database of electronic health records (EHRs) of more than 118 million US patients to conduct rigorous target trial emulation in patients with type 2 diabetes to examine associations of semaglutide or tirzepatide with optic nerve and visual pathway disorders, including NAION.

### Future directions in the treatment of gastroparesis [^115F5kKh]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Understanding of gastroparesis is evolving, in part because of systematic studies on the pathology, pathophysiology, and outcomes. It is clear that simply accelerating gastric emptying may not effectively control symptoms in this syndrome and more creative approaches are required that address aberrant sensation (vagal and spinal) as well as regional disturbances in motility. Further, with the growing recognition of a possible inflammatory basis, the prospects of disease modifying now seem realistic.

### Post hoc analysis of SURPASS-1 to-5: efficacy and safety of tirzepatide in adults with type 2 diabetes are independent of baseline characteristics [^114GPyAp]. Diabetes Therapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Tirzepatide was generally well tolerated in all five SURPASS trials. The most common TEAEs within the gastrointestinal system organ class were nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. No pattern of elevated hypoglycemia risk was observed with respect to body weight subgroups or tirzepatide dose even in participants with longer duration of diabetes > 10 years, or BMI < 30 kg/m 2 who may have less insulin resistance. However, a tendency toward hypoglycemia < 54 mg/dL or severe hypoglycemia was observed among participants enrolled in SURPASS-4 among whom concomitant sulfonylurea use was permitted or among participants taking insulin in SURPASS-5. Otherwise, tirzepatide treatment was generally associated with low rates of hypoglycemia.

This analysis should be interpreted in the context of several limitations. The SURPASS trials were neither designed nor powered to assess the differential efficacy of tirzepatide between these subgroups of participants. This was a post hoc analysis of five different SURPASS trials and the analysis used unpooled data with several differences in trial characteristics and assessed a composite that was not controlled for multiplicity. Moreover, in some cases, the numbers in the subgroups were small. The analysis also does not account for social determinants of health, which may impact the glycemic and weight outcomes in this population. However, the large percentage of participants from SURPASS-1 through -5 included in the current analysis and in previously published studies provides reassurance that the efficacy and safety of tirzepatide are consistent regardless of T2D duration, sex, HbA1c, age, or BMI at baseline. Additionally, both ADA/EASD and AACE guidelines stress the importance of treating cardiovascular risk factors; the composite in this analysis did not focus on cardiovascular risk factors or endpoints because the completed SURPASS program was not designed to assess cardiovascular outcomes. The potential clinical relevance of reaching and maintaining near normoglycemia with accompanying clinically relevant weight loss in the context of T2D management and the effect of tirzepatide on cardiovascular outcomes remain to be elucidated.

Common Adverse Reactions

Table 1 shows common adverse reactions associated with the use of ZEPBOUND in the pool of two placebo-controlled trials for weight reduction (Study 1 and Study 2). These adverse reactions occurred more commonly with ZEPBOUND than with placebo and occurred in at least 2% of patients treated with ZEPBOUND.

In a clinical trial for weight reduction that included an intensive lifestyle intervention lead-in period (Study 3), 287 patients were treated with ZEPBOUND for up to 72 weeks. In a randomized withdrawal trial (Study 4), 783 patients were treated with ZEPBOUND for up to 36 weeks, and 335 of these patients were treated for up to 88 weeks [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. In Study 3, 10% of ZEPBOUND-treated patients and 2% of placebo-treated patients discontinued drug due to adverse reactions. In Study 4, 7% of patients discontinued ZEPBOUND treatment before randomized withdrawal at Week 36 due to adverse reactions. In Study 3 and Study 4, adverse reactions were similar to those reported in the two pooled ZEPBOUND clinical trials (Study 1 and Study 2).

Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions

In a pool of Study 1 and 2, gastrointestinal adverse reactions occurred more frequently among patients receiving ZEPBOUND (5 mg 56%, 10 mg 56%, 15 mg 56%) than placebo (30%). More patients receiving ZEPBOUND 5 mg (1.9%), ZEPBOUND 10 mg (3.3%), and ZEPBOUND 15 mg (4.3%) discontinued treatment due to gastrointestinal adverse reactions than patients receiving placebo (0.5%). The majority of nausea, vomiting, and/or diarrhea events occurred during dose escalation and decreased over time.

Hypotension

In a pool of Study 1 and 2, hypotension occurred more frequently among patients taking ZEPBOUND (1.6%) than patients taking placebo (0.1%). Hypotension was more frequently seen in ZEPBOUND-treated patients on concomitant antihypertensive therapy (2.2%) compared to ZEPBOUND-treated patients not on antihypertensive therapy (1.2%). Hypotension also occurred in association with gastrointestinal adverse events and dehydration.

3.3 Safety

A summary of key safety data from the full population of SURPASS‐2 and SUSTAIN FORTE was reviewed (Table 4). The overall safety profile was similar with tirzepatide and semaglutide treatment across all doses with gastrointestinal adverse events including nausea, diarrhoea and vomiting being commonly reported. Because the overall rates of treatment‐emergent adverse events and gastrointestinal adverse events were higher for the common comparator semaglutide 1‐mg arm in SURPASS‐2 (64% and 41%) than in SUSTAIN FORTE (52% and 31%), respectively, any quantitative comparisons for individual adverse events between tirzepatide and semaglutide 2 mg could be misleading without adjusted comparisons.

Glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) receptor agonism — mechanism and interaction with glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA) is outlined as follows: GIP is an incretin whose incretin effect is impaired in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, and it was previously known as gastric inhibitory peptide. Combination GLP-1 RA and GIP RA are in development, illustrated by tirzepatide. Unless combined with GLP-1, it is unclear that GIP receptor agonism alone reduces hunger and reduces body fat, although GIP may enhance some of the effects of GLP-1 receptor agonism and the anti-nausea effects of GIP agonism may reduce the nausea adverse experiences described with GLP-1 receptor agonists. In patients without diabetes, GIP increases insulin secretion and enhances deposition of fat in adipose tissues, whereas in patients with diabetes mellitus, GIP may lose its insulinotropic effect but retain a stimulatory effect on glucagon secretion, potentially worsening adverse lows; nevertheless, GIP receptor agonists may enhance some of the favorable effects of GLP-1 receptor agonists when administered concomitantly.

Prucalopride — evidence, benefits/harms, and certainty in adults with gastroparesis are as follows: Evidence informing the recommendation to use prucalopride was derived from 2 crossover RCTs that compared prucalopride with placebo in individuals with gastroparesis, including one study limited to idiopathic gastroparesis and another limited to diabetes mellitus or mixed connective tissue disease, and overall the trials were at low risk for bias. Prucalopride produced score reductions that, however, did not meet the threshold for clinical importance, and there was an increased risk of serious adverse effects observed and adverse events leading to discontinuation of treatment. The overall CoE was very low, rated down for serious risk of bias and serious to very serious imprecision, and publication bias was not suspected. Of the 2 studies, the trial focused on idiopathic gastroparesis showed favorable results, whereas the study involving primarily diabetes-related gastroparesis did not. Prucalopride is currently approved for use in CIC and works exclusively as a promotility agent; although the included RCTs revealed significant improvements, when judged on the basis of meaningful improvement they did not reach a predefined threshold of clinical significance. The recommendation acknowledges that many patients with symptom improvement had idiopathic gastroparesis, and it is possible that some patients — especially with coexisting constipation — would reasonably elect to treat both conditions with 1 medication; prucalopride has been associated with reports of depression and suicidal thoughts/behavior, particularly in the initial weeks, and whether specific counseling is needed is unknown, as there has been no evidence of a causal association between prucalopride treatment and these outcomes.

Retained Gastric Content When the Stomach Should be Empty: Relation to Dysfunctional Meal-related Gastric Emptying or Impaired Interdigestive Motility?

If retained gastric contents are observed in the morning (the typical time for endoscopic procedures and induction of anesthesia) after an > 12-hour fast (after dinner), the question arises regarding whether this can be related to the typical gastric emptying curve following meal ingestion. Gastric emptying is usually measured over periods of up to 6 hours, when > 90% of solid meal components should have emptied, as shown in Fig. 5. This 6-hour period coincides with the time during which labeled glucose enters the circulation after oral glucose or mixed meals. In addition to mean values, individual gastric emptying curves are shown for those subjects with T2D, who had the slowest gastric emptying at baseline or after treatment with lixisenatide or liraglutide (green; Fig. 5A). When their gastric emptying was predicted for postmeal hours 6 to 12, even those patients should have had minimal residual gastric content by 12 hours. Thus, one could doubt that deceleration of the typical course of postprandial gastric emptying is what explains retained gastric contents.

Figure 5.
Indirect evidence to demonstrate that slow pot-prandial gastric emptying should not result in substantial gastric retention 12 hours after the last meal. (A) Six-hour gastric emptying tests (13 C- octanoate breath for labeling solid meal components) analyzed using Wagner-Nelson equations were performed in 47 T2D subjects at baseline (black curves, with dotted lines indicating ± 95% confidence intervals). Results from subjects with substantially decelerated gastric emptying (at baseline or 10 weeks after initiating treatment with lixisenatide [20 µg/d] or liraglutide [1.8 mg/d]) are also shown. Gastric emptying curves between 6.5 and 12 hours after meal intake were interpolated assuming an exponential decay (from an initial plateau of 100%) based on the measurements during the initial 6 hours. Even those with slow gastric emptying achieved a gastric content near 0% by 12 hours, which would be a typical interval between a last meal (eg, dinner at 7) and an early procedure (endoscopy or general anesthesia) in the morning of the following day. Data used for display and modeling are from Quast et al.

Gastroparesis — buspirone effects and certainty: Compared with placebo, changes with buspirone were not clinically important based on predefined minimal important differences, there was possible worsening in the abdominal pain score, and there was no clinically important difference in the risk of serious adverse events between patients who received buspirone and placebo. The overall certainty of evidence was very low, and the single clinical trial comparing buspirone with placebo did not show significant improvements in nausea, vomiting, early satiety, postprandial fullness, or overall symptom severity score; despite this, Panel Content Experts felt that buspirone could be useful in patients with gastroparesis whose predominant symptoms are early satiety and bloating, especially in the absence of any signal suggesting increased risk of serious adverse events among those treated with buspirone.

Specification of Target Trials

Study Overview

We compared semaglutide or tirzepatide with other antidiabetic medications for the associated risk of optic nerve and visual pathway disorders in patients with type 2 diabetes who had no prior diagnosis of any eye disorder (determined by the absence of International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision [ICD-10] codes H00-H59, "Diseases of the eye and adnexa", documented in EHRs) using a target trial emulation framework. Other antidiabetic medications included insulin, metformin, dipeptidyl-peptidase-4 inhibitors, sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors, sulfonylureas, thiazolidinediones, and other GLP-1RAs (albiglutide, dulaglutide, exenatide, liraglutide, and lixisenatide). Key protocol components are listed in eTable 1 in Supplement 1.

Semaglutide and tirzepatide are newer and more potent GLP-RAs to treat type 2 diabetes and obesity. To examine differences between semaglutide or tirzepatide and first-generation GLP-1RAs in their associated risk for NAION and other optic nerve and visual pathway disorders, we performed a head-to-head comparison of semaglutide or tirzepatide with other GLP-1RAs and a head-to-head comparison of semaglutide with tirzepatide.

Eligibility Criteria

Eligibility criteria for all target trials included a prior diagnosis of type 2 diabetes, a recent medical encounter for type 2 diabetes diagnosis in the past year (active type 2 diabetes), prescriptions of antidiabetic medications (semaglutide, tirzepatide, or other antidiabetic medications) between December 2017 and January 2023, and diagnosis with at least 1 condition among the prescription guidelines for semaglutide and tirzepatide (eg, obesity, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, heart disease, stroke, kidney disease, or an A 1C level ≥ 8.5%). Exclusion criteria included a prior diagnosis of any eye disorder, including optic nerve and visual pathway disorders; initiation of semaglutide or tirzepatide and comparison antidiabetic medications at the same time; and certain medical conditions (ie, pancreatitis, type 1 diabetes, thyroid cancer, and gastroparesis) based on contraindications, warnings, and limited use information for semaglutide and tirzepatide (eTable 2 in Supplement 1).

4.4 Adverse effects of‐in clinical practice

Although adverse effects with GLP‐1RA use are frequent, and may lead to use of low doses or total discontinuation, real‐world evidence on when adverse effects lead to such outcomes in clinical practice is limited. Further, the long‐term safety of weight loss medications is not well understood, as weight loss RCTs have been relatively short (typical timespan 1–2 years) and too small to detect more rare adverse events with any certainty. As GLP‐1RAs have been used to treat T2D for more than 15 years (although for a different population and usually in lower doses than for weight loss), real‐world studies of T2D populations can offer some insight for weight‐loss populations as well. Here, we summarise the available evidence on frequently reported and/or severe adverse events for GLP‐1RA use, focusing on newer large real‐world population studies including GLP‐1RA users with either obesity or T2D.

4.4.1 Gastrointestinal disturbances

GLP‐1RA has numerous effects on the gastrointestinal tract and nervous system, including slowing gastric emptying, regulating appetite and nausea in the brainstem and hypothalamus, and affecting gut motility and secretion. Accordingly, in both RCTs and in adverse event reporting databases, mild to moderate gastrointestinal disturbances have been frequent, primarily nausea, abdominal pain, gastrointestinal reflux, bloating, vomiting, diarrhoea and constipation, occurring in approximately 80% of GLP‐1RA treated patients across all major weight loss RCTs. In a meta‐analysis of 76 RCTs in T2D, liraglutide, semaglutide and tirzepatide were all associated with significantly increased ORs of nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. The occurrence of such gastrointestinal side effects increases with the dose used.

Comparable real‐world data are scarce, as mild to moderate gastrointestinal symptoms do not necessarily lead to healthcare contacts or registration in medical records or databases. In a community pharmacy‐based survey of semaglutide users, six in 10 users reported having experienced side effects, most commonly nausea (35%) and constipation (29%), suggesting a similar occurrence of these symptoms in clinical practice as in RCTs. Clinical practice experience implies that the symptoms are often dose dependent, observed during the dose escalation period, and tend to diminish over time with continued use.

Side effects

Side effects are relatively common but usually not severe. These are more likely to occur within the first weeks of initiation of therapy and with dose escalation. Side effects tend to decrease in frequency and severity with continuation of a stable dose. GI side effects are most frequent and include nausea (25%–44%), diarrhea (19%–30%), vomiting (8%–24%), constipation (17%–24%), and abdominal pain (9%–20%). Although certain side effects have been reported more commonly with semaglutide than with tirzepatide, trial data suggest that such differences may be a reflection of variation in background (i.e. placebo group) rates in the enrolled trial populations, with the proportional increase in many side effects when compared to placebo being similar for the 2 agents (Table 2). Emerging therapies, such as dual and triple receptor agonists targeting GLP-1, glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), and glucagon pathways, aim to improve efficacy while reducing GI side effects. Real-world experience has largely mirrored these trial data, with GI issues (nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, constipation) being the most frequently reported side effects.

TABLE 2
Common side effects reported in semaglutide and tirzepatide trials for obesity 1.

In the trials, GI symptoms rarely led to discontinuation, with < 10% of participants stopping therapy due to GI issues. Fewer data are available on the impact of GI side effects on adherence in clinical practice. Combining GLP-1s with metformin does not appear to worsen GI side effects, despite metformin's association with similar symptoms.

Underlying causes of these GI symptoms appear varied. GLP-1s delay gastric emptying, leading to bloating, fullness, and nausea. GLP-1s activate several brain regions responsible for weight regulation, appetite, and nausea. Occasionally, GLP-1s affect intestinal motility or secretions, contributing to diarrhea. Higher doses are more likely to provoke these adverse symptoms, indicating a dose-dependent relationship.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Anti-obesity medications targeting NuSH — liraglutide, semaglutide, and tirzepatide — are noted as the most effective among FDA-approved obesity medications and have robust long-term efficacy and safety data up to 4 years for managing obesity in those with and without cardiovascular disease. While all currently available medications were initially approved by the FDA to treat T2DM, they are also approved for obesity. These agents share a similar side effect profile of primarily gastrointestinal side effects (nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal pain, constipation) that can be mitigated with dose reductions or behavioral modifications such as hydration. On maximal doses, average weight loss is 8.0% with liraglutide, 14.9% with semaglutide, and 20.9% with tirzepatide. Liraglutide and semaglutide are GLP-1 receptor agonists.

### Gastrointestinal effects of GLP-1 receptor agonists: mechanisms, management, and future directions [^112tGoA3]. The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

The availability of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists (RAs) such as liraglutide and semaglutide, and a GLP-1 and glucose dependent insulinotropic polypeptide coagonist (tirzepatide) represents a paradigm shift in the management of both type 2 diabetes and obesity. There is now considerable attention, including in the public media, on the effect of both long-acting and short-acting GLP-1RAs to delay gastric emptying. Although slowed gastric emptying is integral to reducing post-prandial blood glucose responses in type 2 diabetes, marked slowing of gastric emptying might also increase the propensity for longer intragastric retention of food, with a consequent increased risk of aspiration at the time of surgery or upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. This Personal View summarises current knowledge of the effects of GLP-1 and GLP-1RAs on gastrointestinal physiology, particularly gastric emptying, and discusses the implications for the development of sound pre-operative or pre-procedural guidelines. The development of pre-procedural guidelines is currently compromised by the poor evidence base, particularly in relation to the effect of long-acting GLP-1RAs on gastric emptying. We suggest pre-procedural management pathways for individuals on GLP-1RA-based therapy and discuss priorities for future research.

### Clinical consequences of delayed gastric emptying with GLP-1 receptor agonists and tirzepatide [^114WqhZg]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

There may be a role for point-of-care gastric ultrasound as a noninvasive, cost-effective strategy to identify patients on GLP-1RA-based therapy with retained gastric contents. However, no prospective studies have yet evaluated the effectiveness of this strategy to reduce the risk of pulmonary aspiration. If retained gastric contents are identified, the management pathways include (1) postponing the procedure, (2) proceeding with the procedure with precautions taken to prevent aspiration (eg, endotracheal intubation), or (3) accelerating gastric emptying pharmacologically. Intravenous erythromycin (∼3 mg/kg) has been shown to reverse the delay in gastric emptying induced by exogenous GLP-1, and the same dose has been shown to initiate interdigestive motility in healthy human subjects. However, the effectiveness of this strategy to accelerate gastric emptying in individuals on GLP-1RA-based therapy has yet to be evaluated.

Until more conclusive evidence becomes available, based on our understanding of the effect of GLP-1RA on physiology, we recommend the following (illustrated in Fig. 7):

There are insufficient data to support the cessation of GLP-1RAs preprocedurally. The American Society of Anesthesiologists' suggestion to withhold short-acting GLP-1RAs for 24 hours and long-acting GLP-1RA for 1 week may not be enough to reduce the risk of aspiration. The optimal duration of cessation of GLP-1RAs to reduce aspiration risk is currently not known, but prolonged withholding of GLP-1RA-based therapy may have deleterious effects on glycemic control and weight management.
Where available, point-of-care gastric ultrasound could be considered to evaluate a patient's risk for aspiration. If retained gastric contents are identified on ultrasound prior to the procedure, it is reasonable to use IV erythromycin (∼3 mg/kg) and then reassess gastric content with ultrasound prior to commencing the procedure. If gastric ultrasound facilities and/or expertise is not available, patients on GLP-1RAs should be treated as unfasted and precautions taken to prevent pulmonary aspiration such as protecting the airway with endotracheal intubation.
A liquid diet for 1 day prior to the procedure may potentially reduce the risk of retained gastric contents, and therefore aspiration, but further studies in larger prospective trials are required before it can be generally recommended.

### Gastroparesis: separate entity or just a part of dyspepsia? [^113Lw7VJ]. Gut (2014). Low credibility.

Gastroparesis is defined by the presence of delayed gastric emptying (GE) in the absence of mechanical obstruction. Symptoms that have been attributed to gastroparesis include postprandial fullness, early satiation nausea and vomiting. Gastroprokinetic drugs are the preferred treatment option. A number of problems with the concept of gastroparesis have been identified recently. Major overlap exists with the symptom complex of the functional dyspepsia subtype of postprandial distress syndrome. The distinguishing feature of gastroparesis is delayed GE, but the correlation between delayed emptying and symptom pattern or severity in gastroparesis is modest and the stability of delayed emptying over time is poor. Other pathophysiological mechanisms such as hypersensitivity or impaired accommodation may also underlie symptoms in patients with gastroparesis. Moreover, symptomatic response to prokinetic therapy is variable and cannot be predicted based on the degree of enhancing GE. A number of approaches have been proposed to increase clinical usefulness of a diagnosis of gastroparesis, including a higher threshold of abnormal emptying and selection of patients with a specific symptom pattern more likely to be associated with delayed emptying.

Of note, semaglutide is a unique compound available in both subcutaneous (s.c.) and oral formulations — the latter developed with an absorption enhancer to facilitate gastric uptake. The therapeutic efficacy and GI intolerance associated with the currently approved highest dose of oral semaglutide (14 mg daily) appear to be lower than those observed with the highest approved dose of s.c. semaglutide (1.0 mg weekly). However, a Phase 2 trial demonstrated that higher doses of oral semaglutide (10, 20 and 40 mg) produced reductions in HbA1c, FPG and body weight comparable with those seen with 1.0 mg weekly s.c. semaglutide. These findings suggest that, should future development support the approval of higher‐dose oral semaglutide, it may offer an effective alternative for patients who prefer non‐injectable therapies for diabetes management. However, additional studies would be needed to evaluate the relationship between therapeutic efficacy and GI intolerance with higher doses of oral semaglutide compared with its subcutaneous formulation.

While GI side effects are the most common AEs associated with GLP‐1 RAs, strategies to mitigate these effects have been recommended. For example, the American Diabetes Association (ADA) advises that GLP‐1 RAs should be titrated slowly to mitigate these GI side effects, particularly in older adults or those with pre‐existing GI conditions. Similarly, the American College of Cardiology (ACC) recommends gradual dose escalation and patient education on meal size to reduce the incidence of these adverse effects. Given the substantial weight loss, glycaemic and cardiovascular benefits consistently demonstrated in randomized, placebo‐controlled clinical trials (RCTs) of long‐acting GLP‐1 RAs, accurately understanding the trade‐offs is essential for practicing evidence‐based medicine in this high‐risk population. In this regard, the current study supports the use of newer incretin mimetics as first‐line options for patients with T2D, particularly those with obesity or difficulty achieving glycaemic control with other therapies. Given their greater efficacy and comparable tolerability, semaglutide and tirzepatide offer a favourable benefit–risk profile that can help address the dual challenges of hyperglycaemia and excess weight. Moreover, the absence of a strong correlation between efficacy and AE rates suggests that clinicians can prioritize more efficacious agents without substantially increasing the risk of treatment discontinuation due to GI AEs.

### Expert consensus document: advances in the diagnosis and classification of gastric and intestinal motility disorders [^117Pgb3J]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2018). Medium credibility.

- The diagnosis of gastroparesis requires objective evidence of clearly delayed gastric emptying in symptomatic patients.

Because accelerated, normal and delayed gastric emptying cannot be differentiated reliably based on type or severity of gastrointestinal symptoms, objective measurement of clearly delayed gastric emptying (gastric emptying time increased above the upper level of normal) using well-validated techniques such as gastric emptying scintigraphy (FIG. 1) is required for diagnosis of gastroparesis. To obtain a more specific symptom pattern and a better separation from functional dyspepsia with delayed emptying, gastroparesis has been proposed to require a stricter definition (for example, > 3 standard deviations above the mean value in healthy volunteers).

The merit of gastric emptying studies for clinical management has been questioned because of variations in the reports of association between gastric emptying rates and symptoms. Several studies published during the past 7 years have shown a positive association between symptoms of gastroparesis and gastric emptying times –. Measurement of gastric emptying can also predict responsiveness to different therapeutic options. For example, the presence of slow gastric emptying in patients with functional dyspepsia was associated with poor response to antidepressant medications that target visceral hypersensitivity. On the other hand, one systematic literature review that used multiple methods, various symptom instruments and diverse treatments showed that most drugs that improved idiopathic and diabetic gastroparesis failed to show a statistically significant relationship with the degree of symptom improvement and acceleration of gastric emptying across studies.

Some groups have observed that the association between clinical improvement and acceleration of gastric emptying depends on the aetiology of gastroparesis, which could partly explain inconsistent findings across studies. Moreover, the modes of action of drugs used for acceleration of gastric emptying are extremely heterogeneous and potentially induce dysfunctions that cause symptoms. For example, motilin receptor agonists markedly accelerate gastric emptying but simultaneously impair gastric accommodation and can induce dyspeptic symptoms. Several additional factors other than a global delay in gastric emptying — such as antral distension, antral hypomotility, gastric dysrhythmias, visceral hypersensitivity or psychological disturbances — could explain, in part, the symptoms experienced by patients with gastroparesis.

- In patients with upper gastrointestinal surgery, diagnosis of dumping syndrome can be made on the basis of typical symptoms and findings such as post prandial hypoglycaemia or hypotension. In unclear cases, provocation tests that prove dumping syndrome are the basis of diagnosis, which is supported by evidence of accelerated gastric emptying, preferably of liquids.

### Gastrointestinal tolerability and weight reduction associated with tirzepatide in adults with obesity or overweight with and without type 2 diabetes in the SURMOUNT-1 to-4 trials [^114nJPy3]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

This post hoc analysis presents several limitations. GI AE analysis is based on data that were self‐reported by participants and one GI AE was sufficient to classify participants as GI AE group. Additionally, systematic scales were not used to measure GI AE severity across the SURMOUNT‐1 to ‐4 trials. GI AE reporting is subject to personal bias and may be impacted by regional differences between trials. In this study, N/V/D GI AEs were pooled and evaluated together for most analyses. Other mechanisms of action that may contribute to weight reduction, particularly decreased gastric emptying, were not explored. Most GI AEs occurred early during the dose escalation, while change in weight was assessed at the end of study. Also, only participants with weight data available at the primary endpoint were included. The exclusion criteria of a known clinically significant gastric emptying abnormality and differences in the use of symptomatic medications for GI tolerability issues during the trial period may have influenced the frequency or severity of GI AEs, and treatment discontinuation. The data analysed excluded participants after treatment discontinuation, which may have skewed towards individuals who were more tolerant to treatment. Mediation analyses and other pooled analyses were not controlled for multiplicity and should be considered as hypothesis‐generating rather than confirmatory. Although mediation analyses were not adjusted for potential post‐randomization confounders, the consistency in results across the SURMOUNT‐1 to 3 trials is reassuring. However, SURMOUNT‐1 to ‐4 differed in study design and populations, which may have impacted GI AE occurrence and total weight reduction. Additionally, none of the SURMOUNT‐1 to ‐4 trials included an active comparator, which does not allow for the comparison of GI tolerability of tirzepatide with other OMMs in the same populations. In the SURMOUNT‐1 to ‐4 trials, the majority of participants were White and had a BMI of 30 kg/m 2 or more, and in SURMOUNT‐1, ‐3 and ‐4, the majority of participants were female; thus, findings may not accurately reflect the general population with obesity or overweight. Finally, average data from this post hoc analysis did not account for interindividual variability in drug response and GI AE occurrence. These aspects may differ between a clinical trial setting and the real‐world patient experience.

Gastroparesis is a complex syndrome with symptoms that include nausea, vomiting, and postprandial abdominal pain, and is frequently accompanied by significant delays in gastric emptying. The pathophysiology of diabetic gastroparesis is fairly well understood; however, idiopathic gastroparesis, which accounts for one-third of all cases, may stem from infections, or autoimmune or neurologic disorders, among other causes. To date, few population-based studies have estimated the true prevalence and incidence of gastroparesis. Nonetheless, its prevalence appears to be rising, as does its incidence among minority populations, documented via hospitalizations, which can impose significant economic burdens on patients.

### Comparative efficacy and tolerability of currently approved incretin mimetics: a systematic analysis of placebo-controlled clinical trials [^114KLBSS]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Given the variability in GI AE rates among placebo‐treated participants, ORs were calculated for each incretin mimetic compound/preparation at all approved doses (Figure 2B, D and Supplementary Figure 6B). While the 95% CIs largely overlapped, significant differences were observed, particularly between the highest doses of exenatide b.i.d. liraglutide, dulaglutide, semaglutide (s.c. and oral) and tirzepatide compared with lower doses of liraglutide, albiglutide and oral semaglutide. Overlap was more pronounced for vomiting (Figure 2B). Although there were trends towards dose–response relationships, most of them did not reach statistical significance. Notably, ORs for GI AEs in dulaglutide studies appeared higher compared with other studies (Figure 2), likely because some studies reported no nausea, vomiting or diarrhoea in the placebo group (details not shown).

3.3.2 Treatment discontinuation

The overall proportion of participants discontinuing randomized treatment for any reason was similar between the active treatment and placebo groups (12.8% vs. 13.5%, OR 0.94, 95% CI: 0.87–1.02; Table 2). A dose–response relationship in the proportion of participants discontinuing treatment for any reason was observed for albiglutide, oral semaglutide and tirzepatide (Supplementary Figure 7A). However, the ORs for all‐cause treatment discontinuation varied across agents without a consistent pattern across agents (Supplementary Figure 7B). In contrast, treatment discontinuation due to adverse events (AEs) was consistently higher among participants receiving incretin mimetics compared with to placebo, with evidence of a dose–response relationship across most agents (Supplementary Figure 7C, D). The proportion discontinuing treatment due to AEs was 6.5% in the active treatment group and 2.9% in the placebo group, for an OR of 2.37 (95% CI: 2.04–2.75; Table 2).

Tirzepatide

Tirzepatide is a gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP)/GLP-1 dual agonist, that works centrally, in the hypothalamus to decrease food intake and possibly increase energy expenditure by desensitizing the GIP receptor, through chronic GIP agonism, in preclinical models. However, animal and human data on the effect of GIP on energy expenditure has been controversial and it is expected that increased energy expenditure will not be seen in humans. Tirzepatide also works peripherally by delaying gastric emptying. It was approved in 2022 for the treatment of type 2 DM. In a 40-week phase 3 trial-SURPASS -2-, patients with DM (n = 1879) were randomized to receive tirzepatide at doses 5, 10 and 15 mg or semaglutide 1 mg. Tirzepatide, at any dose, was superior to semaglutide in reducing HbA1c. The drop in weight was 6.7% for semaglutide, while it was 8.5, 11.0 and 13.0% in each of Tirzepatide doses (p < 0.01). It should be noted however that the dose of semaglutide used in this study is not the approved anti-obesity dose 2.4 mg weekly. The SURMOUNT-1 trial compared different doses of Tirzepatide to placebo in patients with obesity but without DM. Tirzepatide at weekly doses 5 mg, 10 mg and 15 mg, led to a mean total body weight loss of 15, 19 and 21%, respectively, compared to only 3% in the placebo arm, at 72 weeks (p < 0.001 for all comparisons with placebo) (Fig. 2). In this trial, WC at 72 weeks, decreased by 14.0 cm with Tirzepatide 5 mg, 17.7 cm with the 10 mg dose, 18.5 cm with the 15 mg dose, and by 4.0 cm in the placebo group (p < 0.001)(Appendix D). A recent trial sequential analysis exploring the optimal dose of tirzepatide in patients with DM, showed a dose dependent effect on glycemic control and weight reduction, without a significant increase in the rate of adverse events with higher doses. Interestingly, pooled data from SURMOUNT-1 and SURPASS clinical trials programs showed a significant relative risk reduction in major adverse CV events and CV death, by 48 and 49% respectively, with Tirzepatide, compared to control.
