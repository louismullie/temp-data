## Question

Atrial tachycardia treatment

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about atrial tachycardia treatment. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining atrial tachycardia and distinguishing it from atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter. Then, I should verify the acute management algorithm, including hemodynamic stability, rate control, rhythm control, and when to use synchronized cardioversion. Next, I will examine ongoing management, including pharmacologic rhythm control and catheter ablation. After that, I need to consider special populations and contexts such as adult congenital heart disease, pregnancy, and post–AF ablation atrial tachycardias. Finally, I should integrate anticoagulation considerations, shared decision-making, and a practical treatment hierarchy with caveats and monitoring needs.

> Let me first confirm the definition and classification so I don't conflate entities. Atrial tachycardia is a regular SVT arising from a focal atrial site with organized atrial activity and discrete P waves, typically with rates 100–250 bpm, and it is distinct from atrial fibrillation, which is irregular and disorganized, and from atrial flutter, which is usually macroreentrant around the cavotricuspid isthmus with sawtooth flutter waves. Multifocal atrial tachycardia is irregular with at least three distinct P-wave morphologies and is often linked to pulmonary disease or hypoxemia, so I need to keep that in mind when choosing therapy [^d60cb545] [^306a8c1b] [^eef9bee5].

> Now, I should verify the acute management framework. The first branch is hemodynamic stability. If unstable, immediate synchronized cardioversion is indicated, and I should not delay for drugs. If stable, I can proceed with rate control and consider rhythm conversion, while also remembering that adenosine can be both diagnostic and therapeutic in some SVTs, though its utility for focal AT is variable and should be used with caution and monitoring [^c2681b7f] [^93077204] [^22d4d67f].

> For acute rate control in stable focal AT, I need to check which agents are first-line. Intravenous beta-blockers, diltiazem, or verapamil are Class I options and will slow the ventricular rate. Amiodarone is a reasonable alternative when these are contraindicated or ineffective, and I should monitor closely for hypotension and bradycardia. Wait, let me verify the adenosine point: adenosine can terminate some focal ATs and can help unmask atrial activity for diagnosis, but success is inconsistent, so I should not rely on it for reliable termination in focal AT and must be prepared to pivot to rate control or cardioversion if it fails [^c2681b7f] [^69e81ebe] [^36d09b2a].

> For acute rhythm conversion, I should confirm the options and their evidence. Synchronized cardioversion is Class I for unstable patients and can be used electively in stable patients when rhythm control is desired. Pharmacologic cardioversion with ibutilide is reasonable in stable patients, with awareness of torsades risk and the need for continuous ECG monitoring for at least four hours after dosing. Adenosine may work in select focal ATs but is less predictable than in AVNRT/AVRT, so I should set expectations accordingly and have a backup plan [^c2681b7f] [^7b5bfb17] [^36d09b2a].

> Next, I should review ongoing management and the role of ablation. Catheter ablation is highly effective for focal AT and is increasingly preferred in symptomatic patients, with success rates often exceeding 90% in experienced centers. Hold on, I should verify guideline strength: ACC/AHA/HRS gives ablation a Class I recommendation as an alternative to pharmacologic therapy in symptomatic focal AT, and ESC guidance similarly elevates ablation for recurrent symptomatic AT. I need to ensure patients understand that ablation is curative but invasive, with risks such as vascular injury, phrenic nerve injury, and rare perforation, and that success depends on accurate mapping of the focal source [^15546db2] [^c25273fb] [^02d6de3b].

> For pharmacologic rhythm control when ablation is deferred or contraindicated, I should double-check safety in structural heart disease. Flecainide or propafenone are reasonable in patients without structural heart disease or ischemia, whereas sotalol or dofetilide are preferred when structural heart disease is present. Amiodarone is effective but should be reserved given long-term toxicity; I need to check for pulmonary, hepatic, thyroid, and ocular adverse effects with chronic use. In incessant AT, I should prioritize rate control and consider early ablation to prevent tachycardia-mediated cardiomyopathy, which can occur in up to 10% of patients with sustained SVT [^88715758] [^c25273fb] [^d60cb545].

> I will now examine special populations and contexts. In adult congenital heart disease, I should confirm that anticoagulation is recommended for atrial flutter or AT in alignment with AF protocols, and that synchronized cardioversion, adenosine, diltiazem, esmolol, ibutilide, or procainamide are acceptable acute options depending on stability and anatomy. But wait, what if the patient is pregnant? Transplacental therapy with agents like digoxin, beta-blockers, or even amiodarone may be required for fetal SVT with hydrops, balancing maternal-fetal risks and typically managed in specialized centers [^75db9e83] [^9186ac85] [^baad17b8].

> Post–AF ablation atrial tachycardias deserve separate attention. Let me consider the mechanism and approach. These often reflect macroreentrant circuits or focal drivers and can be quite symptomatic; mapping and ablation are frequently required, sometimes with specialized techniques such as epicardial or chemical ablation. I should confirm that these arrhythmias are common after persistent AF ablation and that early recurrence during the blanking period does not necessarily predict long-term failure, though it warrants close follow-up and consideration of repeat ablation if symptoms persist [^511e372f] [^b465355e] [^d2cc2b95].

> Anticoagulation is another area where I need to ensure I don't overgeneralize. Initially, I thought anticoagulation was universally required for atrial tachycardia, but wait, let me verify the nuance. For typical CTI-dependent atrial flutter, guidelines align anticoagulation with AF protocols, and after successful CTI ablation many clinicians discontinue anticoagulation if no AF is detected, though subsequent AF risk remains substantial. For focal AT, routine anticoagulation is not mandated unless there is concomitant AF, prior thromboembolism, or other stroke risk factors, so I should individualize based on CHA2DS2-VASc and the clinical context rather than apply a blanket rule [^1e84b519] [^9178e421].

> Shared decision-making is essential throughout, and I should confirm that guidelines emphasize patient preferences, comorbidities, and lifestyle. Patients value symptom relief, avoidance of procedures, and medication burdens differently, and I need to explain the trade-offs between drug therapy and ablation, including success rates, durability, and procedural risks. I should also remember that vagal maneuvers, while first-line in many SVTs, are less reliable in focal AT and should not delay definitive rate or rhythm control when symptoms are significant [^29c01659] [^d3219274] [^8ce1624a].

> Let me synthesize a practical hierarchy while keeping the evidence straight. For acute management, stabilize and cardiovert if unstable. If stable, start with IV beta-blocker, diltiazem, or verapamil for rate control, consider adenosine for diagnostic or occasional therapeutic benefit, and use ibutilide or synchronized cardioversion for rhythm conversion when appropriate. For ongoing management, prioritize catheter ablation in symptomatic patients given high success, reserving antiarrhythmics for those declining or unsuitable for ablation, with flecainide or propafenone for structurally normal hearts and sotalol, dofetilide, or amiodarone for structural disease. Monitor for proarrhythmia, organ toxicity, and recurrence, and tailor anticoagulation to AF risk profiles rather than to AT alone [^c2681b7f] [^15546db2] [^c25273fb] [^1e84b519].

> Finally, I should double-check key safety pearls so I don't miss harm. Avoid nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers in decompensated systolic heart failure for rate control, be cautious with ibutilide in prolonged QT or electrolyte disturbances, and avoid AV nodal blockade in pre-excited AF or flutter where it may promote 1:1 conduction. If I inadvertently conflated AF and AT earlier, I need to explicitly correct that now: AF management principles do not automatically translate to focal AT, particularly regarding anticoagulation and first-line rhythm strategies, so I must anchor decisions to the specific arrhythmia mechanism and guideline-directed therapy [^ee36b44d] [^34012937] [^22d4d67f].

Atrial tachycardia (AT) management is **individualized** based on symptoms, hemodynamics, and comorbidities [^d3219274]. For acute therapy, prioritize **rate control** with IV beta-blockers or non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers [^c2681b7f]; use synchronized cardioversion if unstable [^d8f4b4c2]. For long-term therapy, **catheter ablation is first-line** for symptomatic or drug-refractory AT given high success and low complication rates [^15546db2] [^c25273fb]. If ablation is not feasible, use beta-blockers, diltiazem, or verapamil for rate control [^c25273fb]; consider flecainide or propafenone for rhythm control in patients without structural heart disease [^88715758], and sotalol, dofetilide, or amiodarone when structural heart disease is present [^c25273fb]. Treat underlying causes and monitor for tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy [^ee36b44d].

## Acute management

### Hemodynamically unstable patients

In hemodynamically unstable patients, **immediate synchronized cardioversion** is indicated [^d8f4b4c2].

---

### Hemodynamically stable patients

#### Rate control

First-line agents include **IV beta-blockers** (metoprolol, esmolol) or **non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers** (diltiazem, verapamil) [^c2681b7f] [^22d4d67f]. Consider **IV amiodarone** if beta-blockers or calcium channel blockers are contraindicated or ineffective [^69e81ebe].

---

#### Rhythm control

- **Synchronized cardioversion**: Effective for acute conversion; consider if pharmacologic therapy fails or is contraindicated [^c2681b7f].
- **Adenosine**: May terminate some focal ATs; useful for diagnosis and treatment in stable patients [^36d09b2a] [^84dcb656].
- **Ibutilide**: Consider for acute pharmacologic cardioversion in stable patients; monitor for QT prolongation and torsades de pointes [^7b5bfb17].

---

## Chronic management

### Catheter ablation

Catheter ablation is **first-line** for symptomatic or drug-refractory AT, with success rates of 80–95% and low complication rates [^15546db2] [^c25273fb]. It is particularly effective for focal AT and incessant tachycardias [^c25273fb].

---

### Pharmacologic therapy

#### Rate control

Preferred agents include **beta-blockers** or **non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers** (diltiazem, verapamil) [^c25273fb]. Use **digoxin** when beta-blockers or calcium channel blockers are contraindicated or ineffective [^c25273fb].

---

#### Rhythm control

- **Flecainide or propafenone**: For patients without structural heart disease or ischemic heart disease [^88715758].
- **Sotalol, dofetilide, or amiodarone**: For patients with structural heart disease or ischemic heart disease [^c25273fb].
- **Amiodarone**: Reserved for refractory cases due to long-term toxicity [^5f7c4ce6].

---

## Special considerations

### Tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy

Tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy is managed by **aggressive rate or rhythm control** to reverse ventricular dysfunction [^ee36b44d]. Catheter ablation is often preferred to achieve rapid rhythm control [^ee36b44d].

---

### Multifocal atrial tachycardia (MAT)

In multifocal atrial tachycardia, **beta-blockers** are first-line if tolerated; calcium channel blockers are alternatives [^c25273fb]. Address underlying respiratory or metabolic causes [^notfound].

---

### Post-atrial fibrillation ablation atrial tachycardias

Post–atrial fibrillation ablation atrial tachycardias often require **specialized mapping and ablation techniques** due to complex mechanisms [^511e372f].

---

## Follow-up and monitoring

Follow-up should include **regular ECG monitoring** to detect recurrence and assess treatment efficacy. Evaluate for **complications** such as tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy, thromboembolism, and drug toxicity [^ee36b44d]. Provide **patient education** on symptom recognition, medication adherence, and when to seek medical attention [^29c01659].

---

## Summary of treatment algorithm

| **Clinical scenario** | **First-line treatment** | **Alternative treatment** |
|-|-|-|
| Acute, unstable | Synchronized cardioversion | N/A |
| Acute, stable | IV beta-blockers or calcium channel blockers | IV amiodarone; synchronized cardioversion |
| Chronic, symptomatic | Catheter ablation | Beta-blockers; calcium channel blockers; antiarrhythmics |
| Chronic, asymptomatic | Observation or rate control | Catheter ablation if symptomatic |
| Structural heart disease | Amiodarone; sotalol; dofetilide | Catheter ablation |
| No structural heart disease | Flecainide; propafenone | Catheter ablation |

---

Atrial tachycardia treatment is **individualized**, with catheter ablation as the preferred definitive therapy for symptomatic patients, while rate control and antiarrhythmic drugs are used when ablation is not feasible or as adjuncts.

### Curative ablation for atrial fibrillation: what clinical trials do we need to establish efficacy [^0b373293]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2003). Low credibility.

In contrast to other supraventricular tachycardias, curative treatment of atrial fibrillation, although increasingly available and rapidly evolving, is neither as effective nor the first choice. Until recently, the unavailability of nonsurgical curative treatment may have fueled a debate on the relative importance of restoring sinus rhythm versus controlling the ventricular rate during atrial fibrillation. Recent randomized trials (PIAF, AFFIRM, and RACE) using very limited atrial fibrillation burden assessment show that pharmacologic ventricular rate control is much safer and possibly more effective than pharmacologic restoration of sinus rhythm. A clinical trial comparing a truly curative treatment of atrial fibrillation-such as catheter ablation targeting pulmonary vein isolation-with pharmacologic treatment is required. It should focus on reliable efficacy parameters, use vigilant assessment of safety, and, most importantly, be structured to provide all-important prognostic information on long-term outcome. Atrial fibrillation burden is a theoretically robust efficacy parameter, but accurate quantification over a sufficiently long period of monitoring will require technologically innovative noninvasive rhythm monitoring devices.

Importance

Atrial fibrillation is a common arrhythmia that affects more than 2.5 million people in the United States and causes substantial morbidity and mortality, especially regarding the increased risk of stroke.

Objective

To summarize atrial fibrillation treatment exclusive of stroke prevention.

Evidence Review

An Ovid MEDLINE comprehensive literature search was performed on atrial fibrillation therapy excluding anticoagulation and emphasizing studies published within the last 5 years through April 2015 (N=5044 references). The 2014 atrial fibrillation guideline from the American Heart Association, the American College of Cardiology, and the Heart Rhythm Society also was reviewed.

Findings

Reversible causes of atrial fibrillation should be identified. Risk factor modification, including weight loss and treatment of hypertension, diabetes, and obstructive sleep apnea can reduce atrial fibrillation episodes. Appropriate anticoagulation is necessary for patients at substantial stroke risk regardless of rate or rhythm treatment strategy. Sinus rhythm is often needed to control symptoms; however, an alternative strategy for atrial fibrillation is appropriate rate control. Rate control is safe in older patients (those who are about age ≥65 years) followed up for a few years, but no such safety data exist for patients younger than 60 years or for those followed up for longer periods. Thus, selection of therapy is individualized, taking into account present and future medical problems for the patient. Choice of an antiarrhythmic drug is based on safety first vs efficacy. Catheter ablation is an effective nonpharmacological alternative that is often, but not always, the second-line treatment. Reduction of the frequency and duration of atrial fibrillation episodes that result in a significant improvement in quality of life is a good marker of drug treatment success and complete elimination of atrial fibrillation is not required in many patients. Rate control is usually achieved with a β-blocker or non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers. It is important to assess adequate rate control during both rest and activity. If the ventricular rate goes uncontrolled for a prolonged period, tachycardia-mediated cardiomyopathy can occur.

Conclusions and Relevance

Therapy for atrial fibrillation includes prevention and modification of inciting causes and appropriate anticoagulation. Rate control is necessary for all patients. Maintenance of sinus rhythm with drugs or catheter ablation should be considered based on the individual needs of each patient.

### Focal atrial tachycardia [^02d6de3b]. Heart (2010). Low credibility.

Focal atrial tachycardia is a relatively uncommon arrhythmia. Nevertheless, the management of highly symptomatic patients with focal atrial tachycardia can be problematic owing to the poor response to medical treatment. Moreover, focal atrial tachycardia can trigger other atrial arrhythmias like atrial fibrillation and flutter. Radiofrequency ablation of focal atrial tachycardia is extremely successful and this approach is becoming the preferred treatment for symptomatic patients.In this review, we describe the pathophysiology, anatomical localisation, clinical features, diagnosis and therapeutic options for the management of focal atrial tachycardia.

Heart Rhythm (2016). Medium credibility.

Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) management—research and surveillance priorities emphasize that antiarrhythmic drug options are limited and evidence is often extrapolated from atrial fibrillation (AF), that efficacy differs by tachycardia mechanism including potential differences for class III agents between AF and atrial flutter, and that limited data exist for less common SVTs such as junctional tachycardia and multifocal atrial tachycardia (AT). The document states that “we must consider the role of electronic medical records, registries, and national datasets” when trials are not feasible, outlines collaborative multicenter registries with national societies, the National Institutes of Health, and the US Food and Drug Administration to capture safety and long-term outcomes, and notes that “Mandatory postmarket surveillance data collection on new drugs for SVT could also be considered by the US Food and Drug Administration as a condition for drug approval.” It highlights unresolved mechanisms in inappropriate sinus tachycardia (IST) and an increasing number of SVT patients in specific groups such as after ablation (especially AF), adult congenital heart disease (ACHD), and advanced age, creating opportunities for clinical research. Priorities include new pharmacological therapies when ablation is not an option or has failed, investigation of atrial channel–selective drugs under AF study for AT, further study of mapping and ablation to maximize success with minimal risk, assessment of new personal monitoring and implantable devices and the impact of shared decision making on outcomes, and investigation of quality-of-life improvement strategies alongside cost-effectiveness studies.

Atrial flutter—acute treatment recommendations: COR I, LOE B-NR, acute antithrombotic therapy is recommended to align with antithrombotic therapy for atrial fibrillation (AF). COR IIa, LOE B-R, intravenous amiodarone can be useful for acute control of the ventricular rate in atrial flutter with systolic heart failure when beta blockers are contraindicated or ineffective and in the absence of pre-excitation; because of potential toxicity, amiodarone should not be used for long-term rate control in most patients, and potential risks and benefits should be considered for patients with atrial flutter lasting ≥48 hours who are not adequately anticoagulated.

Circulation (2006). Medium credibility.

Tachycardia-mediated ventricular dysfunction in atrial fibrillation may improve with rate control. In one study, the median LV ejection fraction increased with rate control from 25% to 52%, and conduction disturbances may exacerbate mitral regurgitation and limit ventricular filling. Controlling the ventricular rate may reverse these effects.

Heart Rhythm (2016). Medium credibility.

Atrial flutter—acute treatment (2015 ACC/AHA/HRS SVT guideline) lists Class I recommendations: I A—oral dofetilide or intravenous ibutilide is useful for acute pharmacological cardioversion in patients with atrial flutter, with intravenous ibutilide converting atrial flutter to sinus rhythm in approximately 60% of cases; the major risk is torsades de pointes, patients receiving ibutilide should undergo continuous ECG monitoring during administration and for at least 4 hours after completion of dosing, and pretreatment with magnesium can increase the efficacy and reduce the risk of torsades de pointes. I B-R—intravenous or oral beta blockers, diltiazem, or verapamil are useful for acute rate control in patients with atrial flutter who are hemodynamically stable. I B-NR—elective synchronized cardioversion is indicated to stabilize patients with well-tolerated atrial flutter when a rhythm-control strategy is being pursued, and I B-NR—synchronized cardioversion is recommended for acute treatment of patients with atrial flutter who are hemodynamically unstable and do not respond to pharmacological therapies. I C-LD—rapid atrial pacing is useful for acute conversion of atrial flutter in patients who have pacing wires in place as part of a permanent pacemaker or implantable cardioverter–defibrillator or for temporary atrial pacing after cardiac surgery; atrial pacing is effective at terminating flutter in >50% of cases, and pace-termination is performed by pacing approximately 5% to 10% above the atrial flutter rate and by maintaining pacing for ≥15 seconds with repeated attempts at incrementally faster rates (reducing the pacing cycle length by 5 to 10 ms) until normal sinus rhythm or AF occurs.

ACC/AHA/ACCP/HRS 2023—Synopsis and epidemiology of AFL and post-ablation AF risk: AFL is a common atrial arrhythmia with a reported overall incidence of 88 per 100 000 person-years, and the incidence increases with age; it is 2.5 times more common in men than in women and is more likely with underlying heart failure or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Because of the high effectiveness of CTI ablation, many physicians may elect to discontinue oral anticoagulation >1 month after ablation in the absence of previously detected AF, but subsequent AF after CTI-dependent AFL ablation has been reported as 34% over 14 months. Non–CTI-dependent or “atypical” AFL or atrial tachycardia after AF ablation should be anticoagulated and managed in a manner similar to AF, and this section refers to treatment of “typical” (CTI-dependent) AFL.

### New antiarrhythmic drugs for establishing sinus rhythm in atrial fibrillation: what are our therapies likely to be by 2010 and beyond? [^8fba3861]. American Heart Journal (2007). Low credibility.

The management of atrial fibrillation (AF) is plagued by, among other things, limitations in the efficacy, tolerance, and safety of currently available agents for the conversion of AF to sinus rhythm and for the maintenance of sinus rhythm. This review describes some of the most promising approaches to new therapies that may overcome some of the limitations of our current therapies. The agents we have chosen to review are representative of these new approaches and have completed their phase III trials and have submitted an application for approval for release by regulatory agencies or have almost completed their phase III trials and appear likely to submit for approval in the not to distant future.

Atrial flutter ongoing management—Catheter ablation of the cavotricuspid isthmus (CTI) is useful in patients with atrial flutter that is either symptomatic or refractory to pharmacological rate control, and beta blockers, diltiazem, or verapamil are useful to control the ventricular rate in patients with hemodynamically tolerated atrial flutter. Catheter ablation is useful in patients with recurrent symptomatic non–CTI-dependent flutter after failure of at least 1 antiarrhythmic agent, and ongoing management with antithrombotic therapy is recommended in patients with atrial flutter to align with recommended antithrombotic therapy for patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). For rhythm maintenance in symptomatic, recurrent atrial flutter, the following drugs can be useful with the drug choice depending on underlying heart disease and comorbidities: amiodarone, dofetilide, or sotalol. Catheter ablation is reasonable in patients with CTI-dependent atrial flutter that occurs as the result of flecainide, propafenone, or amiodarone used for treatment of AF, and catheter ablation of the CTI is reasonable in patients undergoing catheter ablation of AF who also have a history of documented clinical or induced CTI-dependent atrial flutter. Catheter ablation is reasonable in patients with recurrent symptomatic non–CTI-dependent flutter as primary therapy, before therapeutic trials of antiarrhythmic drugs, after carefully weighing potential risks and benefits of treatment options; flecainide or propafenone may be considered to maintain sinus rhythm in patients without structural heart disease or ischemic heart disease who have symptomatic recurrent atrial flutter; and catheter ablation may be reasonable for asymptomatic patients with recurrent atrial flutter.

### Chapter 2: rate versus rhythm control [^1d27eb25]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a potentially serious health risk, both because of its symptoms and because of its association with an increased risk for heart failure, hospitalization, thromboembolism, and death. Chapter 2 discusses selection of appropriate treatments and when to initiate these therapies. Older trials focused on comparing rate versus rhythm control treatment options for AF. It is now recognized that both rate and rhythm control are important and can be used together. This chapter reviews the historical, pivotal rate versus rhythm control trials that failed to show any overall survival benefit of rhythm over rate control, as well as the trials' now-recognized limitations with respect to modern therapy. In addition, an in-depth discussion of the more recent trials of antiarrhythmic drugs (AAD) and ablation techniques (which have become available since the original rate versus rhythm trials were performed) is included. These updated trials show that when applied to patient- and disease-specific situations, rhythm control can reduce the risk for mortality and hospitalization. The chapter also reviews the guidelines that have been developed to achieve these goals. Chapter 2 is summarized as follows: (1) Rate control is needed (at rest and during exertion) to reduce rate-related symptoms when rhythm control is ineffective or incomplete and to prevent a tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy. (2) Previous trials with pharmacological therapy alone comparing rate versus rhythm control using the AADs available at that time failed to show any overall survival benefit of rhythm control over rate control. (3) These earlier trials had many methodological limitations and enrolled participants who did not have access to modern therapies. (4) Newer therapies, including those for stroke prevention, dronedarone (the latest approved AAD), and AF ablation, have improved the safety and efficacy of rhythm control strategies.

### Practice implications of the atrial fibrillation guidelines [^69a61efe]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2013). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation is one of the most common and complex cardiac arrhythmias. Using currently available evidence, leading medical societies have established recommendations for the optimal management of atrial fibrillation. These guidelines have recently been updated by 4 consensus groups: the European Society of Cardiology, the American College of Chest Physicians, the Canadian Cardiovascular Society, and a task force of 3 societies from the United States: the American College of Cardiology Foundation, the American Heart Association, and the Heart Rhythm Society. The present review focused on the similarities and differences among these recently updated guidelines. Key revisions included updated information on newer treatments for rhythm control, treatment options to reduce atrial fibrillation complications, and updated anticoagulant management for thromboprophylaxis.

### Overview of the management of atrial fibrillation: what is the current state of the art? [^888eac12]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2003). Low credibility.

Management of Atrial Fibrillation. There are three fundamental approaches to the management of atrial fibrillation (AF): rate control, rhythm control, and anticoagulation. Selecting a course of treatment requires a thorough knowledge of these therapeutic alternatives. This article explores treatment options, including the relative benefits of rate control versus rhythm control, which are complicated by the lack of highly effective and safe antiarrhythmic drugs. Anticoagulation is also an important issue in AF management, and warfarin effectively reduces the incidence of thromboembolic events in AF patients. The use of warfarin, however, presents its own complications. We conclude that individualization of therapy is paramount when treating AF.

Aim

The "2023 ACC/AHA/ACCP/HRS Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Atrial Fibrillation" provides recommendations to guide clinicians in the treatment of patients with atrial fibrillation.

Methods

A comprehensive literature search was conducted from May 12, 2022, to November 3, 2022, encompassing studies, reviews, and other evidence conducted on human subjects that were published in English from PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, and other selected databases relevant to this guideline. Additional relevant studies, published through November 2022, during the guideline writing process, were also considered by the writing committee and added to the evidence tables, where appropriate.

Structure

Atrial fibrillation is the most sustained common arrhythmia, and its incidence and prevalence are increasing in the United States and globally. Recommendations from the "2014 AHA/ACC/HRS Guideline for the Management of Patients With Atrial Fibrillation" and the "2019 AHA/ACC/HRS Focused Update of the 2014 AHA/ACC/HRS Guideline for the Management of Patients With Atrial Fibrillation" have been updated with new evidence to guide clinicians. In addition, new recommendations addressing atrial fibrillation and thromboembolic risk assessment, anticoagulation, left atrial appendage occlusion, atrial fibrillation catheter or surgical ablation, and risk factor modification and atrial fibrillation prevention have been developed.

Atrial premature beats (APBs) and non‑sustained atrial tachycardia (NSAT)—clinical significance and treatment: APBs and NSAT are common in older individuals, with frequent APBs considered markers of atrial electrical vulnerability and predictors of incident AF, and atrial ectopic beats are markers of increased risk of stroke and cardiovascular death in older individuals. There is no consensus whether suppressing APBs/NSAT reduces AF or cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, but efficacy of sotalol, flecainide, and propafenone for sustained atrial tachycardia can be extrapolated to frequent APBs and NSAT. In left ventricular systolic dysfunction, amiodarone and beta‑blockers are the preferred option if AAD treatment is indicated, and when frequent APBs/NSAT occur with structural heart disease, optimizing therapy of the underlying condition may reduce arrhythmia burden and deter arrhythmia‑induced cardiomyopathy. Consensus statements note that symptomatic patients with frequent APBs and NSAT might be treated with beta‑blockers, sotalol, flecainide, or propafenone, and that in structural heart disease such patients might be treated with amiodarone or beta‑blocker, with optimization of the underlying condition recommended.

### Tachycardia and atrial fibrillation-related cardiomyopathies: potential mechanisms and current therapies [^ef4ca12a]. JACC: Heart Failure (2024). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is associated with an increased risk of new-onset ventricular contractile dysfunction, termed arrhythmia-induced cardiomyopathy (AIC). Although cardioembolic stroke remains the most feared and widely studied complication of AF, AIC is also a clinically important consequence of AF that portends significant morbidity and mortality to patients with AF. Current treatments are aimed at restoring sinus rhythm through catheter ablation and rate and rhythm control, but these treatments do not target the underlying molecular mechanisms driving the progression from AF to AIC. Here, we describe the clinical features of the various AIC subtypes, discuss the pathophysiologic mechanisms driving the progression from AF to AIC, and review the evidence surrounding current treatment options. In this review, we aim to identify key knowledge gaps that will enable the development of more effective AIC therapies that target cellular and molecular mechanisms.

### Pharmacologic management of atrial fibrillation: current therapeutic strategies [^f11ba6da]. American Heart Journal (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Atrial fibrillation (AF), the most common form of sustained arrhythmia, is associated with a frightening risk of embolic complications, tachycardia-related ventricular dysfunction, and often disabling symptoms. Pharmacologic therapy is the treatment used most commonly to restore and maintain sinus rhythm, to prevent recurrences, or to control ventricular response rate.

Methods

This article reviews published data on pharmacologic treatment and discusses alternative systems to classify AF and to choose appropriate pharmacologic therapy.

Results

AF is either paroxysmal or chronic. Attacks of paroxysmal AF can differ in duration, frequency, and functional tolerance. In the new classification system described, 3 clinical aspects of paroxysmal AF are distinguished on the basis of their implications for therapy. Chronic AF usually occurs in association with clinical conditions that cause atrial distention. The risk of chronic AF is significantly increased by the presence of congestive heart failure or rheumatic heart disease. Mortality rate is greater among patients with chronic AF regardless of the presence of coexisting cardiac disease. The various options available for the treatment of chronic AF include restoration of sinus rhythm or control of ventricular rate. Cardioversion may be accomplished with pharmacologic or electrical treatment. For patients in whom cardioversion is not indicated or who have not responded to this therapy, antiarrhythmic agents used to control ventricular response rate include nondihydropyridine calcium antagonists, digoxin, or beta-blockers. For patients who are successfully cardioverted, sodium channel blockers or potassium channel blockers such as sotalol, amiodarone, or a pure class III agent such as dofetilide, a selective potassium channel blocker, may be used to prevent recurrent AF to maintain normal sinus rhythm.

Conclusions

The ultimate choice of the antiarrhythmic drug will depend on the presence or absence of structural heart disease. An additional concern with chronic AF is the risk of arterial embolization resulting from atrial stasis and the formation of thrombi. In patients with chronic AF the risk of embolic stroke is increased 6-fold. Therefore anticoagulant therapy should be considered in patients at high risk for embolization. Selection of the appropriate treatment should be based on the concepts recently developed by the Sicilian Gambit Group (based on the specific channels blocked by the antiarrhythmic agent) and on clinical experience gained over the years with antiarrhythmic agents. For example, termination of AF is best accomplished with either a sodium channel blocker (class I agent) or a potassium channel blocker (class III agent). In contrast, ventricular response rate is readily controlled by a beta-blocker (propranolol) or a calcium channel blocker (verapamil). Alternatively, antiarrhythmic drug therapy may be chosen based on the Vaughan-Williams classification, which identifies the cellular electrophysiologic effects of the drug.

Direct-current cardioversion of atrial fibrillation and flutter—recommendations: When a rapid ventricular response does not respond promptly to pharmacological measures in AF with ongoing myocardial ischemia, symptomatic hypotension, angina, or HF, immediate R-wave synchronized direct-current cardioversion is recommended (Level of Evidence: C). Immediate direct-current cardioversion is recommended for AF with preexcitation when very rapid tachycardia or hemodynamic instability occurs (Level of Evidence: B). Cardioversion is recommended in patients without hemodynamic instability when AF symptoms are unacceptable, and in case of early relapse after cardioversion, repeated direct-current attempts may be made following administration of antiarrhythmic medication (Level of Evidence: C). As Class IIa, direct-current cardioversion can be useful to restore sinus rhythm as part of a long-term management strategy in AF (Level of Evidence: B), and patient preference is a reasonable consideration for infrequently repeated cardioversions in symptomatic or recurrent AF (Level of Evidence: C). As Class III, frequent repetition of direct-current cardioversion is not recommended when periods of sinus rhythm are relatively short after multiple procedures despite prophylactic antiarrhythmic drug therapy (Level of Evidence: C), and electrical cardioversion is contraindicated in patients with digitalis toxicity or hypokalemia (Level of Evidence: C).

### Review of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines on the management of atrial and ventricular arrhythmias [^594bf772]. Heart (2024). Medium credibility.

The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines present a synopsis of extensive internal evidence and technology reviews, with a particular focus on clinical efficacy and cost-effectiveness within the NHS in England. This approach has delivered a novel perspective on arrhythmia management, with important distinctions from other policymakers' recommendations. For example, when compared with the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and the American Heart Association (AHA)/Heart Rhythm Society (HRS)/American College of Cardiology (ACC) guidelines on atrial fibrillation (AF), NICE advocates unique strategies regarding arrhythmia detection, stroke and bleeding risk stratification, and rhythm control (NICE CG 196). Likewise, for patients at risk of sudden cardiac death, NICE TA314 not only recommends device therapy based on New York Heart Association class and ECG findings, but also incorporates quality-adjusted life year data from analysis of key randomised controlled trials.This review examines the NICE guidelines, together with those from the AHA/HRS/ACC and ESC, on the management of AF and ventricular arrhythmias and highlights the key common features and discrepancies between these important documents.

### Catheter ablation of atrial tachycardia following atrial fibrillation ablation [^b465355e]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2009). Low credibility.

Atrial tachycardias represent the second front of atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation. They are frequently encountered during the index ablation for patients with persistent AF and are common following ablation of persistent AF, occurring in half of all patients who have had AF successfully terminated. An atrial tachycardia is rightly seen as a failure of AF ablation, as these tachycardias are poorly tolerated by patients. This article describes a simple, practical approach to diagnosis and ablation of these atrial tachycardias.

### Mapping and ablation of post-AF atrial tachycardias [^511e372f]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Atrial tachycardias are commonly encountered in patients undergoing catheter ablation of persistent atrial fibrillation (AF). Unlike typical atrial flutter that can be readily recognized and ablated, these post-AF tachycardias can arise from a wide variety of locations and involve a multiplicity of mechanisms. Apart from diagnostic challenges, radiofrequency ablation to eliminate the tachycardias may require multiple approaches. In addition, specialized techniques such as epicardial and chemical ablation may be required for definitive treatment. This review describes the various mechanisms and approaches to mapping and ablation of these challenging tachycardias.

Europace (2017). Medium credibility.

Management of supraventricular tachycardias causing atrial fibrillation—when paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF) and supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) associate, medical therapy may apply for both although ablation of both mechanisms seems most appropriate. Ablation of SVT or flutter may abolish atrial fibrillation (AF) or make it better amenable to rhythm control, although frequently electrophysiologists will perform pulmonary vein isolation at the same time. In patients with overt pre-excitation suffering from AF, ablation of the accessory pathway may prevent further AF attacks and is the preferred treatment; usually flecainide or propafenone are prescribed and amiodarone may be needed in the presence of concurrent cardiac disease. After ablation of the flutter it is advocated to continue drug treatment for suppression of the initial AF although in some cases the AF attacks may stop spontaneously. To avoid repeat procedures, SVT mechanisms should be checked electrophysiologically during any AF ablation, especially in the younger non-remodelled AF patients.

### Innovative approaches to anti-arrhythmic drug therapy [^8fb8de6f]. Nature Reviews: Drug Discovery (2006). Medium credibility.

Normal cardiac function requires an appropriate and regular beating rate (cardiac rhythm). When the heart rhythm is too fast or too slow, cardiac function can be impaired, with derangements that vary from mild symptoms to life-threatening complications. Irregularities, particularly those involving excessively fast or slow rates, constitute cardiac 'arrhythmias'. In the past, drug treatment of cardiac arrhythmias has proven difficult, both because of inadequate effectiveness and a risk of serious complications. However, a variety of recent advances have opened up exciting possibilities for the development of novel and superior approaches to arrhythmia therapy. This article will review recent progress and future prospects for treating two particularly important cardiac arrhythmias: atrial fibrillation and ventricular fibrillation.

### Antiarrhythmic drug therapy for atrial fibrillation: are the guidelines guiding clinical practice? [^5d4def6f]. Clinical Cardiology (2006). Low credibility.

The AFFIRM study showed no clear survival advantage for a rhythm versus rate control strategy in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). However, rhythm control with antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs) is appropriate in a large number of patients with AF. The American College of Cardiology/ American Heart Association/European Society of Cardiology AF management guidelines include a safety-based algorithm for selection of AAD therapy. Class 1C agents are recommended as first-line therapy in patients without or with minimal structural heart disease. However, market research and clinical study data indicate a growing use of class III agents (mainly amiodarone) despite long-term safety and tolerability concerns, suggesting that clinical practice does not adhere to current guidelines.

Shared decision making in SVT—“It is important that the patient be included in clinical decision-making processes, with consideration of his/her preferences and goals for therapy, as well as his/her unique physical, psychological, and social situation.” “In selected cases, personalized, self-directed interventions can be developed in partnership with the patient, such as vagal maneuvers and ‘pill-in-the-pocket’ drug therapy.” “Shared decision making is especially important for patients with SVT,” and “SVT treatment can be nuanced and requires expert knowledge of EP processes and treatment options.” Options “are highly specific to the exact type of arrhythmia and can depend on certain characteristics of a particular arrhythmia (eg, whether there is pre-excitation),” so “a detailed explanation of the benefits and risks must be included in the conversation,” with patients “encouraged to ask questions” and clinicians using “lay terminology” to provide “the best possible understanding of all management options in terms of risks, benefits, and potential effects on quality of life.”

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Aim

The "2023 ACC/AHA/ACCP/HRS Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Patients With Atrial Fibrillation" provides recommendations to guide clinicians in the treatment of patients with atrial fibrillation.

Methods

A comprehensive literature search was conducted from May 12, 2022, to November 3, 2022, encompassing studies, reviews, and other evidence conducted on human subjects that were published in English from PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, and other selected databases relevant to this guideline. Additional relevant studies, published through November 2022, during the guideline writing process, were also considered by the writing committee and added to the evidence tables, where appropriate.

Structure

Atrial fibrillation is the most sustained common arrhythmia, and its incidence and prevalence are increasing in the United States and globally. Recommendations from the "2014 AHA/ACC/HRS Guideline for the Management of Patients With Atrial Fibrillation" and the "2019 AHA/ACC/HRS Focused Update of the 2014 AHA/ACC/HRS Guideline for the Management of Patients With Atrial Fibrillation" have been updated with new evidence to guide clinicians. In addition, new recommendations addressing atrial fibrillation and thromboembolic risk assessment, anticoagulation, left atrial appendage occlusion, atrial fibrillation catheter or surgical ablation, and risk factor modification and atrial fibrillation prevention have been developed.

Heart Rhythm (2016). Medium credibility.

Atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT) acute treatment—vagal maneuvers are recommended for acute treatment in patients with AVNRT, and these maneuvers should be performed with the patient in the supine position; the practice of applying pressure to the eyeball is potentially dangerous and has been abandoned. Adenosine is recommended for acute treatment in patients with AVNRT, and can be considered as both a therapeutic and diagnostic agent in narrow-complex tachyarrhythmias; it will acutely terminate AVNRT in approximately 95% of patients and will unmask atrial activity in arrhythmias such as atrial flutter or AT. Synchronized cardioversion should be performed for acute treatment in hemodynamically unstable patients with AVNRT when adenosine and vagal maneuvers do not terminate the tachycardia or are not feasible, and synchronized cardioversion is recommended for acute treatment in hemodynamically stable patients with AVNRT when pharmacological therapy does not terminate the tachycardia or is contraindicated. Intravenous beta blockers, diltiazem, or verapamil are reasonable for acute treatment in hemodynamically stable patients with AVNRT, whereas oral beta blockers, diltiazem, or verapamil may be reasonable for acute treatment in hemodynamically stable patients with AVNRT. Intravenous amiodarone may be considered for acute treatment in hemodynamically stable patients with AVNRT when other therapies are ineffective or contraindicated.

AF catheter ablation—indications and first-line use in atrial fibrillation (AF) and atrial flutter (AFL): In patients with symptomatic AF in whom antiarrhythmic drugs have been ineffective, contraindicated, not tolerated or not preferred, and continued rhythm control is desired, catheter ablation is useful to improve symptoms (Class 1, Level A). In selected patients (generally younger with few comorbidities) with symptomatic paroxysmal AF in whom rhythm control is desired, catheter ablation is useful as first-line therapy to improve symptoms and reduce progression to persistent AF (Class 1, Level A). In patients with symptomatic or clinically significant AFL, catheter ablation is useful for improving symptoms (Class 1, Level A). In patients who are undergoing ablation for AF, ablation of additional clinically significant supraventricular arrhythmias can be useful to reduce the likelihood of future atrial arrhythmias (Class 2a, Level B-NR). In patients (other than younger with few comorbidities) with symptomatic paroxysmal or persistent AF who are being managed with a rhythm-control strategy, catheter ablation as first-line therapy can be useful to improve symptoms (Class 2a, Level B-R).

Focal atrial tachycardia (AT)—definition and characteristics: Focal AT can be sustained or nonsustained, and the atrial rate is usually between 100 bpm and 250 bpm; in adults it is usually benign, although AT-mediated cardiomyopathy has been reported in up to 10% of patients referred for ablation of incessant SVT, and nonsustained focal AT is common and often does not require treatment; the origin can be estimated from P‑wave morphology on a standard 12‑lead ECG and is ultimately confirmed by mapping during EP studies when successful ablation is achieved; focal AT originates more frequently from the right atrium than from the left atrium; sinus node reentrant tachycardia is an uncommon type of focal AT with a microreentrant circuit in the region of the sinoatrial node that produces a P‑wave morphology identical to sinus tachycardia, and distinguishing features include an abrupt onset and termination and often a longer RP interval than during normal sinus rhythm.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common outpatient arrhythmia. The recent ACC/AHA/ESC guidelines outline a variety of approaches to the management of AF, but their implementation into clinical practice requires multi-faceted patient evaluations and assessments for optimizing patient care. Using a case-based approach, issues such as rate versus rhythm control, anticoagulation, cardioversion, pharmacological and catheter ablation for maintenance of sinus rhythm, and the pathophysiology of AF are discussed. These data were originally presented at a satellite symposium titled Case Studies with the Experts: Management Decisions in AF, held on May 10, 2007, during the annual Heart Rhythm Society meeting.

### Cryoablation or drug therapy for initial treatment of atrial fibrillation [^484bc5ff]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2021). Excellent credibility.

Background

Guidelines recommend a trial of one or more antiarrhythmic drugs before catheter ablation is considered in patients with atrial fibrillation. However, first-line ablation may be more effective in maintaining sinus rhythm.

Methods

We randomly assigned 303 patients with symptomatic, paroxysmal, untreated atrial fibrillation to undergo catheter ablation with a cryothermy balloon or to receive antiarrhythmic drug therapy for initial rhythm control. All the patients received an implantable cardiac monitoring device to detect atrial tachyarrhythmia. The follow-up period was 12 months. The primary end point was the first documented recurrence of any atrial tachyarrhythmia (atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, or atrial tachycardia) between 91 and 365 days after catheter ablation or the initiation of an antiarrhythmic drug. The secondary end points included freedom from symptomatic arrhythmia, the atrial fibrillation burden, and quality of life.

Results

At 1 year, a recurrence of atrial tachyarrhythmia had occurred in 66 of 154 patients (42.9%) assigned to undergo ablation and in 101 of 149 patients (67.8%) assigned to receive antiarrhythmic drugs (hazard ratio, 0.48; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.35 to 0.66; P<0.001). Symptomatic atrial tachyarrhythmia had recurred in 11.0% of the patients who underwent ablation and in 26.2% of those who received antiarrhythmic drugs (hazard ratio, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.22 to 0.68). The median percentage of time in atrial fibrillation was 0% (interquartile range, 0 to 0.08) with ablation and 0.13% (interquartile range, 0 to 1.60) with antiarrhythmic drugs. Serious adverse events occurred in 5 patients (3.2%) who underwent ablation and in 6 patients (4.0%) who received antiarrhythmic drugs.

Conclusions

Among patients receiving initial treatment for symptomatic, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, there was a significantly lower rate of atrial fibrillation recurrence with catheter cryoballoon ablation than with antiarrhythmic drug therapy, as assessed by continuous cardiac rhythm monitoring.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) mechanisms and pathophysiology—rate characteristics, triggers, and substrate—are outlined as AF is a chaotic, rapid (300–500 bpm), and irregular atrial rhythm. AF results from electrophysiological and structural abnormalities that disrupt impulse generation or cellular connections, often arising from ectopic action potentials most commonly generated in the pulmonary veins (PVs) of the left atrium (LA) or from reentrant activity promoted by heterogeneous conduction due to interstitial fibrosis. Atrial ectopy can generate runs of tachycardia, while persistent AF requires a substrate that is either sufficiently large or sufficiently heterogeneous to sustain reentry, and the ECG abnormalities likely reflect a shared phenotype across diverse etiologies.

Europace (2019). High credibility.

Tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy—management principles state that treatment goals are to slow the heart rate or reduce extrasystoles, relieve symptoms, prevent hospitalization, and improve survival; management of TICMP comprises evidence-based treatment for heart failure (HF) with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, beta-blockers and aldosterone receptor antagonists, and diuretics may be used to relieve congestive symptoms. Rate control therapy commonly includes beta-blockers and/or digoxin, and non-dihydropyridine calcium channel antagonists should be avoided in the context of systolic HF associated with TICMP. In TICMP due to atrial fibrillation (AF), options include rate-controlling drugs, antiarrhythmic drugs, direct current cardioversion, or catheter ablation in addition to anticoagulation. While older randomized trials of rhythm vs rate control in AF found no differences in morbidity or mortality, two recent randomized controlled trials (AATAC and CASTLE-AF) have demonstrated superiority in reducing AF burden, reduced hospitalization, and reduced mortality with catheter ablation in systolic HF when compared to drug therapy; however, these studies had a narrow clinical profile from highly specialized units and are not fully generalizable, and whether findings extrapolate to truly asymptomatic patients is not known, so consideration of ablation in asymptomatic patients should be individualized. Given the high success rate and low risk with catheter ablation of typical right sided atrial flutter, ablation to eliminate atrial flutter is recommended when TICMP is suspected, whereas decisions for atypical atrial flutter should be individualized.

### Rhythm control in atrial fibrillation: endpoints for device-based trials [^b128109a]. Heart Rhythm (2004). Low credibility.

Newer generations of pacemakers and implantable cardioverter defibrillators have enhanced diagnostic features that permit detection and storage of information about the frequency, duration, time of onset, and rate characteristics of multiple consecutive episodes of atrial tachycardia and atrial fibrillation (AF). Parameters available in implantable devices that might serve as outcome measures to assess the impact of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic therapies for prevention of AF include time to first recurrence of AF, intervals between successive episodes of AF, AF frequency, AF duration, AF burden (amount/unit time), and episodes of symptomatic AF. Each parameter has advantages and limitations. The characteristics/temporal patterns of AF may determine the ideal study outcome measure to address a specific hypothesis. Clinical studies of therapies for prevention of AF need to be directed to populations with the arrhythmia substrate that will be targeted by the therapy. Device-based metrics are suitable to assess the impact of pacing or pharmacologic therapies for prevention of AF. However, it is important to establish that suppression of AF is associated with an improvement in some clinical outcome. Relevant outcomes might include improvement in symptoms, quality of life, or functional capacity; reduction in hospitalization for cardiovascular causes, stroke death, or overall mortality; or a composite of some of these parameters.

### Atrial fibrillation therapy now and in the future: drugs, biologicals, and ablation [^c816c47e]. Circulation Research (2014). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a complex disease with multiple inter-relating causes culminating in rapid, seemingly disorganized atrial activation. Therapy targeting AF is rapidly changing and improving. The purpose of this review is to summarize current state-of-the-art diagnostic and therapeutic modalities for treatment of AF. The review focuses on reviewing treatment as it relates to the pathophysiological basis of disease and reviews preclinical and clinical evidence for potential new diagnostic and therapeutic modalities, including imaging, biomarkers, pharmacological therapy, and ablative strategies for AF. Current ablation and drug therapy approaches to treating AF are largely based on treating the arrhythmia once the substrate occurs and is more effective in paroxysmal AF rather than persistent or permanent AF. However, there is much research aimed at prevention strategies, targeting AF substrate, so-called upstream therapy. Improved diagnostics, using imaging, genetics, and biomarkers, are needed to better identify subtypes of AF based on underlying substrate/mechanism to allow more directed therapeutic approaches. In addition, novel antiarrhythmics with more atrial specific effects may reduce limiting proarrhythmic side effects. Advances in ablation therapy are aimed at improving technology to reduce procedure time and in mechanism-targeted approaches.

### Increased heart rate is associated with higher mortality in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF): results from the outcomes registry for better informed treatment of AF (ORBIT-AF) [^10d5c14b]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia worldwide and leads to significant morbidity and mortality.Several therapies are available for the maintenance of sinus rhythm in patients with AF; however, none has been definitively demonstrated to improve long-term survival.Therefore, many patients remain in chronic AF and are managed with a “rate control only” strategy; such patients are often treated with medication or interventions to prevent excessive tachycardia, limit symptoms, and prevent the development of cardiomyopathy and/or heart failure. However, target heart rates are not well established and clinical trials to date have failed to demonstrate a benefit to strict heart rate control (<80 beats per minute [bpm]) relative to a more-lenient rate control strategy (ie, <110 bpm).Several shortcomings of these data have been cited, including lack of power and a lower than expected difference between treatment groups.Owing to these and other data, regional guidelines provide divergent recommendations regarding the optimal approach to rate control. The US guidelines recommend more-strict rate control (heart rate <80 bpm Class IIA recommendation, level of evidence B), whereas the European Society of Cardiology guidelines advocate lenient rate control (heart rate <110 Class IIA recommendation, level of evidence B).

Patterns of heart rate control of patients with AF in routine clinical practice, as well as the association between heart rate and subsequent clinical outcomes, have not been well described. Using the nation’s largest prospective, outpatient clinical registry of AF patients, our study aimed to: (1) describe the patterns of heart rate control in US clinical practice; (2) describe the relationship between resting heart rate and AF symptom class; and (3) assess the relationship between resting heart rate control and clinical outcomes, including mortality.

Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) in adult congenital heart disease (ACHD)—acute treatment includes: Acute antithrombotic therapy is recommended in ACHD patients who have AF or atrial flutter to align with recommended antithrombotic therapy for patients with AF. Synchronized cardioversion is recommended for acute treatment in ACHD patients and SVT who are hemodynamically unstable. Intravenous diltiazem or esmolol (with extra caution used for either agent, observing for the development of hypotension) is recommended for acute treatment in ACHD patients and SVT who are hemodynamically stable. Intravenous adenosine is recommended for acute treatment in ACHD patients and SVT. Intravenous ibutilide or procainamide can be effective for acute treatment in ACHD patients and atrial flutter who are hemodynamically stable. Atrial pacing can be effective for acute treatment in ACHD patients and SVT who are hemodynamically stable and anticoagulated as per current guidelines for antithrombotic therapy in patients with AF. Elective synchronized cardioversion can be useful for acute termination of AT or atrial flutter in ACHD patients when acute pharmacological therapy is ineffective or contraindicated. Oral dofetilide or sotalol may be reasonable for acute treatment in ACHD patients and AT and/or atrial flutter who are hemodynamically stable.

The weight of evidence is ranked from highest (A) to lowest (C): Level of Evidence A indicates data derived from multiple randomized clinical trials or meta-analyses, Level of Evidence B indicates data derived from a single randomized trial or nonrandomized studies, and Level of Evidence C indicates only consensus opinion of experts, case studies, or standard-of-care. These categories are derived primarily from published data.

### Assessment of rhythm and rate control in patients with atrial fibrillation [^176ecd1a]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2006). Low credibility.

A recent series of randomized prospective clinical trials that compared rate control with rhythm control in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) found no significant difference in primary outcome between the two strategies. However, these trials lacked clear criteria for defining "successful" rate or rhythm control. Various measures have been used to gauge the success of antiarrhythmic drug therapy, including time to first recurrence of AF, any AF recurrence, AF burden, and a reduction in symptoms. Determining the success of antiarrhythmic therapy can be relatively straightforward by using how patients feel during therapy as a key endpoint. Most patients are satisfied with a major reduction in symptomatic AF episodes and can live comfortably with occasional episodes of AF. For those who are bothered by even infrequent, brief AF episodes, a treatment regimen that eliminates nearly all AF recurrences is required, although often hard to achieve. Catheter ablation may be necessary to achieve a successful outcome in these patients. Suppression of AF in a patient at high risk of stroke does not, however, remove the need for concomitant warfarin therapy. The endpoints of ventricular rate control are not clear, and the recently published rhythm versus rate control trials lacked standard criteria for judging acceptable rate control. One relatively simple method is to try and achieve a 24-hour heart rate that mimics expected normal sinus rhythm. It is important to achieve good rate control to minimize symptoms and the risk of tachycardia-mediated cardiomyopathy.

### Outcomes of atrial arrhythmia surgery in patients with congenital heart disease: a systematic review [^29569a32]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The improved life expectancy of patients with congenital heart disease is often accompanied by the development of atrial tachyarrhythmias. Similarly, the number of patients requiring redo operations is expected to continue to rise as these patients are aging. Consequently, the role of arrhythmia surgery in the treatment of atrial arrhythmias is likely to become more important in this population. Although atrial arrhythmia surgery is a well‐established part of Fontan conversion procedures, evidence‐based recommendations for arrhythmia surgery for macroreentrant atrial tachycardia and atrial fibrillation in other patients with congenital heart disease are still lacking.

Methods and Results

Twenty‐eight studies were included in this systematic review. The median reported arrhythmia recurrence was 13% (interquartile range, 4%–26%) during follow‐up ranging from 3 months to 15.2 years. A large variation in surgical techniques was observed. Based on the acquired data, biatrial lesions are more effective in the treatment of atrial fibrillation than exclusive right‐sided lesions. Right‐sided lesions may be more appropriate in the treatment of macroreentrant atrial tachycardia; evidence for the superiority of additional left‐sided lesions is lacking. There are not enough data to support the use of exclusive left‐sided lesions. Theoretically, prophylactic atrial arrhythmia surgery may be beneficial in this population, but evidence is currently limited.

Conclusions

To be able to provide recommendations for arrhythmia surgery in patients with congenital heart disease, future studies should report outcomes according to the type of preoperative arrhythmia, underlying congenital heart disease, lesion set, and energy source. This is essential for determining which surgical techniques should ideally be applied under which circumstances.

After AFL ablation, atrial fibrillation occurred in 34%, with a recurrence rate of 23% in those without prior AF versus 53% with prior AF, and by 5 years AF developed in 60% to 70% of patients regardless of prior AF history. The typical substrate is the critical isthmus formed by the inferior vena cava and the tricuspid valve.

### Update on atrial fibrillation [^cb8504ab]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia with a substantial effect on individual morbidity and mortality as well as healthcare expenditure. The management of AF is complex and fraught with many uncertain and contentious issues. We have seen substantial progress in AF management in the last two decades including better understanding of the epidemiology, genomics, monitoring, drug and non-pharmacological treatment of the arrhythmia, its complications and stroke risk reduction. In this review, we present a comprehensive discussion on AF with emphasis on most recent updates.

### Acute treatment of patients with supraventricular (...) [^22d4d67f]. JAMA Network (2016). Excellent credibility.

Vagal maneuvers and adenosine are recommended for the termination of regular SVT of uncertain type, atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia, and atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia. Synchronized cardioversion is recommended for the termination of any hemodynamically unstable SVT. In the absence of hemodynamic compromise, SVT should be treated with synchronized cardioversion when pharmacologic therapy is ineffective or contraindicated. Intravenous diltiazem, verapamil, or metoprolol is recommended for control of heat rate in patients with hemodynamically stable atrial flutter and for the treatment of hemodynamically stable focal atrial tachycardia.

Intravenous diltiazem, verapamil, or metoprolol can be useful in terminating hemodynamically stable regular SVT of uncertain type, multifocal atrial tachycardia. Anticoagulation is recommended in patients with atrial flutter to mirror recommended anticoagulation for patients with atrial fibrillation. Treatment of pre-excited atrial fibrillation with intravenous digoxin, intravenous amiodarone, intravenous or oral β-blockers, diltiazem, and verapamil is potentially harmful. Instead, intravenous ibutilide or procainamide is recommended for the treatment of hemodynamically stable pre-excited atrial fibrillation.

For the termination of SVT, the guideline addressed the following interventions: vagal maneuvers, adenosine, synchronized cardioversion, β-blockers, calcium-channel blockers, digoxin, antiarrhythmic medications, and rapid atrial pacing. The potential benefits and harms of each intervention were carefully considered. Interventions used for the termination of SVT are generally safe as long as no contraindications exist. For example, β-blockers and calcium-channel blockers should not be given in the presence of hypotension. The 1 recommendation involving harm was related to giving digoxin, amiodarone, β-blockers, or calcium-channel blockers for pre-excited atrial fibrillation.

Sinus node reentrant tachycardia—an uncommon focal atrial tachycardia—is characterized by paroxysmal episodes with rates generally 100 bpm to 150 bpm, and confirmation of the reentrant mechanism requires an electrophysiology study with induction during programmed stimulation, demonstration of entrainment, and localization to the sinus node region; if the diagnosis is uncertain clinically, vagal maneuvers may be attempted to better identify the mechanism of supraventricular tachycardia.

### Atrial fibrillation: strategies to control, combat, and cure [^8afc2fc1]. Lancet (2002). Excellent credibility.

Atrial fibrillation is the commonest clinical arrhythmia, is increasing in incidence and prevalence, and is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. The arrhythmia may be paroxysmal (self-limiting), persistent (amenable to cardioversion), or permanent. Especially in its paroxysmal form, atrial fibrillation may be initiated by rapidly firing foci, generally located in the proximal pulmonary veins. Sustained atrial fibrillation is maintained by an atrial tissue substrate capable of accommodating many meandering wavelets. With continuing arrhythmia, the electrophysiological properties of the atria change and further facilitate continuing fibrillation. Treatment is aimed at prevention of thromboembolic complications, restoration and maintenance of sinus rhythm, and control of ventricular rate during atrial fibrillation. With greater understanding of the arrhythmia mechanisms, it is becoming possible to offer targeted curative treatments to more and more patients.

### 2017 HRS / EHRA / ECAS / APHRS / SOLAECE expert consensus statement on catheter and surgical ablation of atrial fibrillation [^d2cc2b95]. Heart Rhythm (2017). Low credibility.

Explanations of this gap between prior expert consensus recommendations and routine clinical practice might reflect the current disconnect between indications for catheter ablation and clinical outcomes of the procedure. Another factor can be cost. On one hand, the main indication for catheter ablation is symptomatic AF and decisions regarding continuation of anticoagulation therapy should be based on the patient’s risk factors for stroke and not on the presence of or type of AF. At the same time, transtelephonic or long-term monitoring is at times recommended after ablation to capture even asymptomatic episodes of AF to evaluate the need to continue anticoagulation. The majority of writing group members do not believe that data currently exist to support this common practice of making decisions regarding anticoagulation based on the presence or absence of AF (see Section 7).

A significant amount of information has accumulated showing that cardiac risk factors such as obesity, sleep apnea, and hypertension are associated with structural and electrical remodeling of the atria, which forms the substrate leading to AF development and progression (see Section 3). The recommended indefinite annual follow-up visits with a health care professional allow for the evaluation and treatment of associated diseases and lifestyle modification rather than monitoring of the rhythm itself.

Early Recurrence After Ablation

Definition and Incidence

Early recurrences of AF after AF ablation has been defined as any recurrence of AF >30 seconds during the first 3 months of follow-up. Late recurrence has been defined as any recurrence of AF >30 seconds between 3 and 12 months after AF. In using the term early recurrence of AF (ERAF) it is recognized that the early recurrence might be AFL or AT. Although we considered defining a new term, early recurrence of ATAs, post-AF ablation, for simplicity we have employed the term early recurrence of AF. Throughout the document and this section of the document, we note that recurrences can present in the form of AF, flutter, or tachycardia.

Early recurrences of AF after RF catheter ablation have been reported in up to 50% of patients within the first 3 months of AF ablation.,,,,,, Because these arrhythmias do not definitively indicate therapy failure over the long term (only half of these patients will manifest later recurrences), this period is also referred to as the blanking or therapy stabilization period. It is also important to recognize that the later AF recurrences are observed during the blanking phase, the lower the chance of long-term success.

### Atrial fibrillation ablation: indications, emerging techniques, and follow-up [^7877c677]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia and its prevalence is expected to increase as our population ages. The medical management of AF has yielded only modest success, and over the past 15years, catheter ablation (CA) has become a mainstay in the treatment for AF. Advancements in the tools used for CA have improved outcomes in patients with both paroxysmal and persistent forms of AF. Additionally, the use of various post-procedure ECG monitoring devices is important for guiding the long-term management of patients with AF. However, long-term AF control in these patients also requires management of other medical comorbidities and risk factors associated with AF.

### Can we improve outcomes in AF patients by early therapy? [^0ffc5acc]. BMC Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation affects at least 1% of the population and causes marked society-wide morbidity and mortality. Current management of atrial fibrillation including antithrombotic therapy and management of concomitant conditions in all patients, rate control therapy in most patients, and rhythm control therapy in patients with severe atrial fibrillation-related symptoms can alleviate atrial fibrillation-related symptoms but can neither effectively prevent recurrent atrial fibrillation nor suppress atrial fibrillation-related complications. Hence, there is a need for better therapy of atrial fibrillation.

The etiology of atrial fibrillation is complex. Most of the causes of atrial fibrillation which are known at present perpetuate themselves in vicious circles, and presence of the arrhythmia by itself causes marked damage of atrial myocardium. These pathophysiological insights suggest that early diagnosis and comprehensive therapy of atrial fibrillation, including adequate therapy of all atrial fibrillation-causing conditions, rate control, and rhythm control therapy, could help to prevent progression of atrial fibrillation and reduce atrial fibrillation-related complications. Such a therapy should make use of safe and effective therapeutic modalities, some of which have become available recently or will become available in the near future. The hypothesis that early diagnosis and early, comprehensive therapy of atrial fibrillation can improve outcomes requires formal testing in controlled trials.
