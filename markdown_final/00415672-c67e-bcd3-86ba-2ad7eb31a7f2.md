## Question

Is Guanfacine a controlled substance

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether guanfacine is a controlled substance. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the most authoritative source, which is the FDA labeling. Then, I should verify whether the extended-release and immediate-release formulations differ in scheduling. Next, I will check for any conflicting regulatory or pharmacologic signals that might suggest abuse potential. Finally, I will synthesize a clear conclusion and note any nuances about discontinuation and safety that could be confused with controlled-substance issues.

> Let me first confirm the primary source. The FDA prescribing information for guanfacine extended-release explicitly states, "Guanfacine extended-release tablets is not a controlled substance and has no known potential for abuse or dependence", which directly answers the question for the ER formulation [^1138nw3K].

> Wait, let me verify whether this applies to the immediate-release formulation as well. The FDA labeling for guanfacine immediate-release (Tenex) states, "No reported abuse or dependence has been associated with the administration of guanfacine hydrochloride", reinforcing that neither the IR nor the ER product is treated as a controlled substance and that there is no recognized abuse or dependence liability in the approved labeling [^114HwX4y].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should double-check for any conflicting signals. I initially wondered if sedation and rebound hypertension on withdrawal might imply controlled-substance status, but that would be a mistake, because these are safety issues common to centrally acting alpha-2 agonists and are not criteria for DEA scheduling; they do not indicate abuse potential or scheduling under the Controlled Substances Act [^115NHbyC] [^111XKXce].

> I need to ensure I'm not conflating guanfacine with other alpha-2 agonists. Clonidine extended-release is also explicitly labeled as not a controlled substance, which aligns with the same mechanistic class and supports the conclusion that guanfacine is not scheduled either [^117XPXZi].

> Next, I should review practical prescribing context to see if any guideline implies scheduling. The AAP ADHD guideline recommends nonstimulants such as extended-release guanfacine when clinicians want to minimize abuse potential, which indirectly confirms that guanfacine lacks abuse liability and is not a controlled substance in routine pediatric and adolescent care [^1134mQyJ].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the bottom line. Guanfacine, both immediate-release and extended-release formulations, is not a controlled substance and has no known potential for abuse or dependence according to FDA labeling, so it is not scheduled under the Controlled Substances Act [^1138nw3K] [^114HwX4y].

---

Guanfacine is **not a controlled substance** [^1138nw3K] and has no known abuse or dependence potential [^111J5M1C]. It is a non-stimulant alpha-2A adrenergic agonist approved for ADHD [^111qqPbt] and hypertension [^113obM5Z], and is not subject to DEA scheduling. Unlike stimulants, guanfacine does not cause euphoria or addiction and is often used when abuse risk is a concern [^1134mQyJ].

---

## Legal classification

According to the FDA, guanfacine extended-release (Intuniv) is **not a controlled substance** [^1138nw3K] and has no known potential for abuse or dependence [^111J5M1C]. The immediate-release formulation (Tenex) likewise has no reported abuse or dependence [^114HwX4y].

---

## Pharmacological properties relevant to abuse potential

Guanfacine is a selective alpha-2A adrenergic agonist that reduces sympathetic outflow, lowering blood pressure and producing sedation [^112NHaNW]. It **does not activate dopamine pathways** associated with reward or addiction, which limits abuse potential compared with stimulants [^notfound].

---

## Clinical evidence regarding abuse and dependence

Clinical trials and postmarketing data show **no evidence of abuse or dependence** with guanfacine [^notfound]. Overdose cases report cardiovascular and CNS effects (hypotension, bradycardia, sedation) but not addiction or withdrawal syndromes [^111dvKUv] [^116uKu9a].

---

## Comparison with controlled substances

Unlike stimulants (e.g. methylphenidate, amphetamines), guanfacine **does not cause euphoria or addiction** and is not regulated as a controlled substance [^1138nw3K]. This makes it a preferred option when abuse risk is a concern [^1134mQyJ].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Guidelines from the American Academy of Pediatrics recommend non-stimulant options, including guanfacine, for patients with **substance use concerns** or when stimulants are unsuitable [^1134mQyJ]. This reflects its favorable abuse profile and safety in these populations.

---

## Summary of evidence

| **Attribute** | **Guanfacine** | **Controlled substances** |
|-|-|-|
| Legal status | Not controlled [^1138nw3K] | Scheduled (II–V) |
| Abuse potential | None known [^111J5M1C] | High to moderate |
| Dependence potential | None known [^111J5M1C] | High to moderate |
| Clinical use | ADHD, hypertension [^111qqPbt] [^113obM5Z] | ADHD, anxiety, pain, etc. |

---

Guanfacine is **not a controlled substance** [^1138nw3K] and has no known abuse or dependence potential [^111J5M1C], making it a suitable alternative to stimulants when abuse risk is a concern [^1134mQyJ].

### No improvement of posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms with guanfacine treatment [^1169Baw3]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

The authors report an 8-week, double-blind, randomized controlled trial of guanfacine versus placebo for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

Method

Veterans with chronic PTSD who were medication-free or receiving stable pharmacotherapy were randomly assigned to guanfacine (N = 29) versus placebo (N = 34).

Results

Guanfacine had no effect on PTSD symptoms, subjective sleep quality, or general mood disturbances. Guanfacine was associated with a number of side effects.

Conclusions

These results do not support the use of alpha 2 agonists in veterans with chronic PTSD.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

Efficacy of guanfacine extended-release tablets in the treatment of ADHD was established in children and adolescents (6 to 17 years) in:

Five short-term, placebo-controlled monotherapy trials (Studies 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6).
One short-term, placebo-controlled adjunctive trial with psychostimulants (Study 3).
One long-term, placebo-controlled monotherapy maintenance trial (Study 7).

Studies 1 and 2: Fixed-dose Guanfacine extended-release tablets Monotherapy

Study 1 (301 study) was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, fixed-dose study, in which efficacy of once daily dosing with guanfacine extended-release tablets (2 mg, 3 mg and 4 mg) was evaluated for 5 weeks (n = 345) in children and adolescents aged 6 to 17 years. Study 2 (304 study) was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, fixed-dose study, in which efficacy of once daily dosing with guanfacine extended-release tablets (1 mg, 2 mg, 3 mg and 4 mg) was evaluated for 6 weeks (n = 324) in children and adolescents aged 6 to 17 years. In both studies, randomized patients in 2 mg, 3 mg and 4 mg dose groups were titrated to their target fixed dose, and continued on the same dose until a dose tapering phase started. The lowest dose of 1 mg used in Study 2 was not randomized to patients weighing more than 50 kg. Patients who weighed less than 25 kg were not included in either study.

### Guanfacine (guanfacine extended-release) [^116RT82L]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Study 6 (316 study) was a 12-week (for children aged 6 to 12) or 15-week (for adolescents aged 13 to 17), randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo- and active-reference, dose-optimization study conducted in pediatric patients (children and adolescents aged 6 to 17 years old inclusive) (n = 337) to assess the efficacy and safety of once-daily dosing (children: 1 to 4 mg/day, adolescents: 1 to 7 mg/day; optimized dose range of 0.05 to 0.12 mg/kg/day) in the treatment of ADHD. Guanfacine extended-release tablets were statistically superior to placebo on symptoms of ADHD in patients 6 to 17 years as measured by change from baseline in ADHD-RS-IV total scores (see Table 17).

Table 17: Flexible-Dose studies

Study 7: Long-Term Maintenance of Guanfacine Extended-Release Tablets Efficacy

Study 7 (315 study) was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized withdrawal trial in pediatric patients aged 6 to 17 years with DSM-IV-TR diagnosis of ADHD. The study consisted of an open-label phase, including a 7-week dose optimization period to titrate patients to an optimal dose (maximum 4 mg/day for children and 7 mg/day for adolescents; optimized dose range: 0.05 to 0.12 mg/kg/day) and a 6-week dose maintenance period. There were 526 patients included in the open-label phase. Among those, 315 patients who met response criteria in the open-label phase were then randomized (1:1, guanfacine extended-release tablets:placebo) in a 26-week, double-blind, randomized withdrawal phase. The response criteria were defined by ≥ 30% reduction in ADHD-RS-IV total score and a Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (CGI-I) score of 1 or 2 during the open-label phase. A statistically significantly lower proportion of treatment failures occurred among guanfacine extended-release tablets patients compared to placebo at the end of the randomized withdrawal period (Figure 4). Treatment failure was defined as a ≥ 50% increase (worsening) in ADHD-RS-IV total score and a ≥ 2-point increase in Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGI-S) score. Patients who met the treatment failure criteria on two consecutive visits or discontinued for any reason were classified as treatment failure.

Interventional agent preparation

Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient guanfacine hydrochloride powder was purchased from Quimica Sintetica S. A. Vanderbilt University Medical Center's Investigational Drug Service compounded and dispensed a 10-mL sterile syringe with a sterile locking syringe cap containing 6 mL 1% lidocaine with 250 µg guanfacine. Sterile syringe preparation was used within 12 h of preparation.

Clinical trial design

This study was a single-center, prospective, randomized, controlled, double-blinded (patients and clinicians), 2-way crossover trial for patients with trigeminal neuralgia or painful trigeminal neuropathy (Figure 1A). Patients were recruited between November 2019 and October 2023. Informed consent was obtained at the first study visit before any study questions or procedures. After informed consent, baseline data were collected and all participants were randomized in permuted pairs to receive either study drug (guanfacine + lidocaine) or active control (lidocaine alone) at the first of 2 injections. Each participant had 2 study-related visits after the baseline visit: procedure visit 1 and procedure visit 2. Participants received the randomly assigned study drug or active control injection as a trigeminal nerve block at procedure visit 1, then the complementary injection (active control or study drug, respectively) at procedure visit 2. A minimum 2-week washout period was required between procedure visits. The Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) pain score was assessed at the start of each study visit. If a participant did not meet or exceed the NRS pain score threshold of 5, then they were not eligible to receive the procedure. Participants whose NRS score was below the threshold at the scheduled time of injection were contacted weekly for 4 weeks to see if their NRS score increased. If it did, they were brought in to complete the injection. After 8 weeks, if the participant's NRS score had not increased, they were told to reach out to the study team directly when their pain increased above a score of 5. The target sample size was 30 study-drug injections vs 30 active control injections. However, not all randomized participants completed both injections, so more than 30 total participants were enrolled.

### A phase I, randomized, open-label, crossover study of the single-dose pharmacokinetic properties of guanfacine extended-release 1-, 2-, and 4-mg tablets in healthy adults [^111E1BWh]. Clinical Therapeutics (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Guanfacine is an alpha(2)-adrenoreceptor agonist used to treat children and adults with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. An extended-release formulation of guanfacine is currently under development.

Objective

The objective of this study was to assess the single-dose pharmacokinetic properties and dose proportionality of guanfacine extended-release (GXR) tablets after oral administration in healthy adults.

Methods

This was a Phase I, randomized, open-label, single-dose, crossover trial of GXR 1-, 2-, and 4-mg tablets in healthy adults. In the lead-in period (period 1), subjects received a single GXR 1-mg tablet, and then were randomized to receive single GXR 2- or 4-mg tablets during 4 separate weekly visits. Vital signs were monitored, blood samples were obtained, and subjects underwent electrocardiography (ECG) before dose administration and at regular intervals over 96 hours. The pharmacokinetic parameters of CmaX, AUC₀–t, and AUC₀–∞ were determined after each dose of GXR in all subjects. Summary statistics for the concentration-time data were analyzed to assess between-dose linearity. An analysis-of-variance model was constructed to test the concentration-time data for dose proportionality. Tolerability was assessed at each visit through the analysis of standard serology tests; urinalysis/drug screen reports; and physical examination, including height and weight measurements; vital-sign data; and ECG findings.

Results

The total study enrollment was 52 subjects, including 28 men (53.8%) and 24 (46.2%) women. The subjects had a mean (SD) age of 32.9 (10.3) years (range, 18–54 years) and a mean (SD) body weight of 73.4 (15.7) kg (range, 49.6–120.0 kg). Forty (76.9%) subjects were Hispanic, 7 (13.5%) were white, and 5 (9.6%) were black. Three subjects were discontinued by the study investigators because of noncompliance with study procedures or use of concomitant medications. Forty-nine subjects completed the study. Mean (SD) values for guanfacine plasma concentrations with GXR 1, 2, and 4 mg, respectively, were 0.98 (0.26), 1.57 (0.51), and 3.58 (1.39) ng/mL for Cmax; 29.3 (8.84), 54.5 (17.7), and 119.1 (42.3) ng/mL. h⁻¹ for AUC₀–t; and 32.4 (8.78), 58.0 (18.9), and 124.1 (45.1) ng/mL. h⁻¹ for AUC₀–∞. Mean (SD) t₁/₂ values were 17.5 (3.8), 16.6 (3.8), and 16.7 (4.90) hours for GXR 1, 2, and 4 mg, respectively. The geometric mean ratios for C(max), AUC(0-t), and AUC(0-infinity) were proportional to dose between GXR 1 and 2 mg, 1 and 4 mg, and 2 and 4 mg, except for the increase in C(max) between GXR 1 and 2 mg. All treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) were assessed as mild or moderate and resolved without treatment with the exception of headache in 3 subjects and 1 case of lower back discomfort, which resolved with therapy. Left rib pain was reported in 1 subject, but it is unknown if it had resolved, since the subject was lost to followup. No subjects withdrew from participation or were discontinued by the study investigators as a result of AEs. The most common treatment-emergent AE, somnolence, occurred in 33 (63.5%) of 52 subjects. All mean vital-sign measurements and mean ECG parameters remained within normal limits after dosing and no marked changes from baseline measurements were noted. Mean values for all test results of hematology and serum chemistry panels were within the reference range at completion of the study, with no significant changes from baseline.

Conclusions

In these 49 healthy adult subjects, the single-dose pharmacokinetic properties of GXR 1-, 2-, and 4-mg tablets appeared to be statistically linear; that is, increases in mean C(max), AUC(0-t), and AUC(0-infinity) of guanfacine were proportional to dose, with the exception of the increase in mean C(max) between GXR 1 and 2 mg. All doses appeared to be well tolerated, with no serious AEs or withdrawal or discontinuation from study participation due to AEs reported.

### Phase I, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation study of the effects on blood pressure of abrupt cessation versus taper down of guanfacine extended-release tablets in adults aged 19 to 24 years [^117E3k6v]. Clinical Therapeutics (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Guanfacine hydrochloride is an alpha(2a)-adrenoreceptor agonist found to be effective in the treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Because the available immediate-release formulation requires multiple daily dosing and has been associated with rebound hypertension on abrupt cessation, an extended-release (ER) formulation has been developed for study of efficacy and tolerability parameters in patients with ADHD.

Objective

This trial was primarily undertaken to determine the effect on blood pressure (BP) of abrupt cessation versus taper-down of guanfacine ER.

Methods

This Phase I, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation trial was conducted at MDS Pharma Services, Lincoln, Nebraska. Male and female healthy young-adult (aged 19–24 years) volunteers were included. Subjects were randomly assigned to receive guanfacine ER as follows. Abrupt-cessation and taper-down groups both received guanfacine ER at forced titration: 1 mg on days 1 to 4, 2 mg on days 5 to 8, 3 mg on days 9 to 12, and 4 mg on days 13 to 16. The abrupt-cessation group then received placebo daily on days 17 to 32. The taper-down group began the following taper-down schedule: 3 mg on days 17 to 20, 2 mg on days 21 to 24, 1 mg on days 25 to 30, and placebo on days 31 to 32. Placebo was administered daily to the subjects in the placebo group (days 1–32). All doses were given in the morning. Tolerability was assessed before (at the 8-hour baseline visit), during (approximately every 4 days and during 48-hour confinements at days 17/18 and 31/32), and 7 days after the study and included assessment of BP and pulse, 12-lead electrocardiography (ECG), and laboratory assays. Adverse events (AEs) were also tracked every 4 days beginning on day 5 and 7, 14, and 30 days poststudy by recording responses and follow-up to a nonleading question about how the patient was feeling that day.

Results

Forty-five subjects were enrolled in the study (15 in each group), and 35 subjects completed it. The mean age of study participants was 22 years, 87% were white, and the ratio of women to men was 2:1. There were no marked differences between groups regarding age, sex, or race. Compared with the taperdown group, the abrupt-cessation group did not exhibit a clinically significant elevation of systolic BP (SBP) or diastolic BP (DBP) or other tolerability parameters, including AEs. Significant differences in BP were observed on days 17/18 (first day of abrupt cessation) and 31/32, but the overall means were not statistically different. The SBP decreases were -7.55% (-8.84 mm Hg) in the abrupt-cessation group and -8.33% (-9.69 mm Hg) in the taper-down group. The DBP decreases were -9.14% (-6.17 mm Hg) in the abrupt-cessation group and -9.94% (-6.59 mm Hg) in the taper-down group. There were no statistically significant or clinically important differences in change or percentage change in pulse from baseline to day 31/32 between the taper-down and placebo groups (least squares mean difference, 2.26 bpm). None of the subjects experienced bradycardia. No clinically important treatment related trends were noted in the clinical laboratory, ECG, or physical examination findings, including vital signs. No serious treatment-emergent AEs were reported in this study. Overall, 124 treatment-emergent AEs were reported in 29 (64%) subjects. Treatment-emergent AEs were reported in 14 (93.3%) of 15 subjects in the abrupt-cessation group, 8 (53.3%) of 15 subjects in the taper-down group, and 7 (46.7%) of 15 subjects in the placebo group. Headache was the most common AE reported in the abrupt-cessation (46.7%) and placebo (13.3%) groups. For the taper down group, it was dry mouth (26.7%). All AEs were classified as mild or moderate.

Conclusion

In this small study group of healthy, young-adult volunteers, guanfacine ER at doses up to 4 mg/d was abruptly discontinued without significant increases in SBP or DBP or other tolerability parameters, including AEs, compared with taper.

### Supplementary guanfacine hydrochloride as a treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in adults: a double blind, placebo-controlled study [^114sAMBP]. Psychiatry Research (2016). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to examine the efficacy of an extended release guanfacine hydrochloride supplement relative to a placebo supplement in adults (19–62) with ADHD and a sub-optimal response to a stimulant-only treatment program. The study's primary outcome measures were the Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Rating Scale and the Clinical Global Impression - Severity. Twenty-six adults who met criteria for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and sub-optimal functioning were randomly assigned to supplement their existing psychostimulant treatment regimen with either a titrated dose (1-6mg) of extended release guanfacine hydrochloride or a matching placebo for a 10-week trial. The data were analyzed with standard mixed model analysis of variance procedures, and participants in both the investigational agent group and the placebo group showed statistically significant improvement in their symptoms and functioning over the course of the trial. The treatments did not differ in terms of their efficacy, safety, or tolerability. Although these results do suggest that both treatments were associated with clinical improvement, the possible impacts of socially desirable responding and regression to the mean on these results are discussed.

### Guanfacine extended release in children and adolescents with attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder: a placebo-controlled trial [^1137WrSk]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

This study compared the efficacy of guanfacine extended release (GXR), a selective alpha(2A)-adrenoceptor agonist, with placebo in children and adolescents with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).

Method

This double-blind, 9-week, dose-ranging, parallel-design, multicenter trial randomized 6- to 17-year-olds with ADHD to once-daily oral GXR in 1-, 2-, 3-, and 4-mg doses or placebo. Primary outcome was change in total ADHD Rating Scale-IV score from baseline to endpoint. Secondary outcomes included changes in scores of hyperactive/impulsive and inattentive subscales; clinician and parent ratings; duration of clinical effect; and safety measures.

Results

Statistically significant reductions in ADHD Rating Scale-IV scores were observed from baseline to endpoint at all doses of GXR, with effect sizes ranging from 0.43 to 0.62. In subjects receiving GXR, mean heart rate and systolic and diastolic blood pressure decreased as the dose of GXR increased and then returned toward baseline during the dose-maintenance and dose-tapering phases of the trial. Most frequent treatment-emergent adverse events (≥ 5%) were somnolence, headache, fatigue, sedation, dizziness, irritability, upper abdominal pain, and nausea. Somnolence, sedation, and fatigue adverse events emerged within the first 2 weeks of dosing and generally resolved by study end.

Conclusions

Guanfacine extended-release was effective in reducing symptoms of ADHD. Adverse events were mild to moderate, did not interfere with improvements in attention, and rarely led to discontinuation.

Table 14: Clinically Important Drug Interactions: Effect of other Drugs on Guanfacine Extended-Release Tablets Concomitant Drug Name or Drug Class Clinical Rationale and Magnitude of Drug Interaction Clinical Recommendation Strong and moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors, e.g., ketoconazole, fluconazole Guanfacine is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4 and its plasma concentrations can be significantly affected resulting in an increase in exposure Consider dose reduction. Strong and moderate CYP3A4 inducers, e.g., rifampin, efavirenz Guanfacine is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4 and its plasma concentrations can be significantly affected resulting in a decrease in exposure Consider dose increase USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS. Risk Summary Available data with guanfacine over decades of use in pregnant women have not identified a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes.

However, use of guanfacine in pregnant women over this time has been infrequent. In animal reproduction studies, rabbits and rats exposed to 3 and 4 times the maximum recommended human dose, respectively, showed no adverse outcomes. However, higher doses were associated with reduced fetal survival and maternal toxicity.

### Enhanced pain relief with guanfacine as an adjuvant for trigeminal nerve blocks: insights from a pheWAS-guided randomized controlled study [^111YP8LN]. Pain Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Overall, this study demonstrated that guanfacine added to lidocaine in a nerve block procedure provided enhanced analgesia, compared to lidocaine alone, for a short-term treatment of trigeminal neuralgia. Additionally, this study showcased the utility of PheWAS analysis in selecting repurposed drugs as interventional agents for clinical trials. Future studies should be conducted to further elucidate the effects of guanfacine in painful nerve disorders.

Symptoms of ADHD were evaluated on a weekly basis by clinicians using the ADHD Rating Scale (ADHD-RS-IV), which includes both hyperactive/impulsive and inattentive subscales. The primary efficacy outcome was the change from baseline to endpoint in ADHD-RS-IV total scores. Endpoint was defined as the last post-randomization treatment week prior to dose tapering for which a valid score was obtained (up to Week 8).

Mean reductions in ADHD-RS-IV total scores at endpoint were statistically significantly greater for guanfacine extended-release tablets given in combination with a psychostimulant compared to placebo given with a psychostimulant for Study 3, for both morning and evening guanfacine extended-release tablets dosing (see Table 17). Nearly two-thirds (64.2%) of patients reached optimal doses in the 0.05 to 0.12 mg/kg/day range.

Studies 4, 5 and 6: Flexible-dose Guanfacine Extended-Release Tablets Monotherapy

Study 4 (314 study) was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, dose-optimization study, in which efficacy of once daily dosing (morning or evening) with guanfacine extended-release tablets (1 mg, 2 mg, 3 mg, and 4 mg) was evaluated for 8 weeks in children aged 6 to 12 years (n = 340).

### A controlled trial of extended-release guanfacine and psychostimulants for attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder [^111A5DWb]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine efficacy, tolerability, and safety of guanfacine extended release (GXR; ≤ 4 mg/d) adjunctive to a long-acting psychostimulant for the treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children and adolescents 6 to 17 years of age with suboptimal, but partial, response to psychostimulant alone.

Method

In this multicenter, 9-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-optimization study, subjects (N = 461) continued their stable dose of psychostimulant given in the morning and were randomized to receive GXR in the morning (GXR AM), GXR in the evening (GXR PM), or placebo. Efficacy measures included ADHD Rating Scale IV (ADHD-RS-IV) and Clinical Global Impressions of Severity of Illness (CGI-S) and Improvement (CGI-I) scales. Safety measures included adverse events (AEs), vital signs, electrocardiograms, and laboratory evaluations.

Results

At endpoint, GXR treatment groups showed significantly greater improvement from baseline ADHD-RS-IV total scores compared with placebo plus psychostimulant (GXR AM, p = .002; GXR PM, p < .001). Significant benefits of GXR treatment versus placebo plus psychostimulant were observed on the CGI-S (GXR AM, p = .013; GXR PM, p < .001) and CGI-I (GXR AM, p = .024; GXR PM, p = .003). At endpoint, small mean decreases in pulse, systolic, and diastolic blood pressure were observed in GXR treatment groups versus placebo plus psychostimulant. No new safety signals emerged following administration of GXR with psychostimulants versus psychostimulants alone. Most AEs were mild to moderate in severity.

Conclusions

Morning or evening GXR administered adjunctively to a psychostimulant showed significantly greater improvement over placebo plus psychostimulant in ADHD symptoms and generated no new safety signals.

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Patient Information).

Dosing and Administration

Instruct patients to swallow guanfacine extended-release tablets whole with water, milk or other liquid. Tablets should not be crushed, chewed or broken prior to administration because this may increase the rate of release of the active drug. Patients should not take guanfacine extended-release tablets together with a high-fat meal, since this can raise blood levels of guanfacine extended-release tablets. Instruct the parent or caregiver to supervise the child or adolescent taking guanfacine extended-release tablets and to keep the bottle of tablets out of reach of children.

Advise patients not to abruptly discontinue guanfacine extended-release tablets as abrupt discontinuation can result in clinically significant rebound hypertension. Concomitant stimulant use and abrupt discontinuation of guanfacine extended-release tablets may increase this hypertensive response. Instruct patients on how to properly taper the dose to minimize the risk of rebound hypertension [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) and Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

Adverse Reactions

Advise patients that sedation can occur, particularly early in treatment or with dose increases. Caution against operating heavy equipment or driving until they know how they respond to treatment with guanfacine extended-release tablets [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Headache and abdominal pain can also occur. If any of these symptoms persist, or other symptoms occur, the patient should be advised to discuss the symptoms with the health care provider.

### Guanfacine (guanfacine extended-release) [^113hqhj8]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

In the monotherapy trials (Studies 1 and 2), subgroup analyses were performed to identify any differences in response based on gender or age (6 to 12 vs. 13 to 17). Analyses of the primary outcome did not suggest any differential responsiveness on the basis of gender. Analyses by age revealed a statistically significant treatment effect only in the 6 to 12 age subgroup. Due to the relatively small proportion of adolescent patients (ages 13 to 17) enrolled into these studies (approximately 25%), these data may not have been sufficient to demonstrate efficacy in the adolescent patients. In these studies, patients were randomized to a fixed dose of guanfacine extended-release tablets rather than optimized by body weight. Therefore, some adolescent patients were randomized to a dose that might have resulted in relatively lower plasma guanfacine concentrations compared to the younger patients. Over half (55%) of the adolescent patients received doses of 0.01 to 0.04 mg/kg. In studies in which systematic pharmacokinetic data were obtained, there was a strong inverse correlation between body weight and plasma guanfacine concentrations.

Table 16: Fixed dose Studies

Study 3: Flexible-dose Guanfacine Extended-Release Tablets as Adjunctive Therapy to Psychostimulants

Study 3 (313 study) was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, dose-optimization study, in which efficacy of once daily optimized dosing (morning or evening) with guanfacine extended-release tablets (1 mg, 2 mg, 3 mg and 4 mg), when co-administered with psychostimulants, was evaluated for 8 weeks, in children and adolescents aged 6 to 17 years with a diagnosis of ADHD, with a sub-optimal response to stimulants (n = 455). Patients were started at the 1 mg guanfacine extended-release tablets dose level and were titrated weekly over a 5-week dose-optimization period to an optimal guanfacine extended-release tablets dose not to exceed 4 mg/day based on tolerability and clinical response. The dose was then maintained for a 3-week dose maintenance period before entry to 1 week of dose tapering. Patients took guanfacine extended-release tablets either in the morning or the evening while maintaining their current dose of psychostimulant treatment given each morning. Allowable psychostimulants in the study were ADDERALL XR®, VYVANSE®, CONCERTA®, FOCALIN XR®, RITALIN LA®, METADATE CD®or FDA-approved generic equivalents.

Discontinuation of Treatment

Blood pressure and pulse may increase above baseline values following discontinuation of guanfacine extended-release tablets. In five studies of children and adolescents [see Clinical Studies (14)], increases in mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure averaging approximately 3 mmHg and increases in heart rate averaging 5 beats per minute above original baseline were observed upon discontinuation with tapering of guanfacine extended-release tablets. In a maintenance of efficacy study, increases in blood pressure and heart rate above baseline slowly diminished over the follow up period, which ranged between 3 and 26 weeks post final dose; the estimated average time to return to baseline was between six and twelve months. In this study, the increases in blood pressure and pulse were not considered serious or associated with adverse events. However, individuals may have larger increases than reflected by the mean changes.

In postmarketing experience, following abrupt discontinuation of guanfacine extended-release tablets, rebound hypertension and hypertensive encephalopathy have been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) and Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

Effects on Height, Weight, and Body Mass Index (BMI)

Patients taking guanfacine extended-release tablets demonstrated similar growth compared to normative data. Patients taking guanfacine extended-release tablets had a mean increase in weight of 0.5 kg compared to those receiving placebo over a comparable treatment period. Patients receiving guanfacine extended-release tablets for at least 12 months in open-label studies gained an average of 8 kg in weight and 8 cm (3 in) in height. The height, weight, and BMI percentile remained stable in patients at 12 months in the long-term studies compared to when they began receiving guanfacine extended-release tablets.

### A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of guanfacine extended release in children and adolescents with attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder [^114rhGkq]. Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

With this study we assessed the efficacy and safety of an extended-release formulation of guanfacine compared with placebo for the treatment of children and adolescents with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.

Methods

In this multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, fixed-dosage escalation study, patients aged 6 to 17 years were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 treatment groups of guanfacine extended release (2, 3, or 4 mg/day) or placebo for 8 weeks. The primary outcome measurement was the Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Rating Scale IV total score. Secondary measurements included Clinical Global Impression of Improvement, Parent's Global Assessment, Conners' Parent Rating Scale-Revised: Short Form, and Conners' Teacher Rating Scale-Revised: Short Form.

Results

A total of 345 patients were randomly assigned to placebo (n = 86) or guanfacine extended release 2 mg (n = 87), 3 mg (n = 86), or 4 mg (n = 86) treatment groups. Least-squares mean changes from baseline to the end point in Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Rating Scale IV total scores were significant in all groups of children taking guanfacine extended release: -16.18 in the 2-mg group, -16.43 in the 3-mg group, and -18.87 in the 4-mg group, compared with -8.48 in the placebo group. All groups of children taking guanfacine extended release showed significant improvement on hyperactivity/impulsivity and inattentiveness subscales of the Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Rating Scale IV, Clinical Global Impression of Improvement, Parent's Global Assessment, Conners' Parent Rating Scale-Revised: Short Form, and Conners' Teacher Rating Scale-Revised: Short Form assessments compared with placebo. The most commonly reported treatment-emergent adverse events were headache, somnolence, fatigue, upper abdominal pain, and sedation. Small to modest changes in blood pressure, pulse rate, and electrocardiogram parameters were observed but were not clinically meaningful.

Conclusions

Guanfacine extended release met the primary and secondary efficacy end points. It was well tolerated and effective compared with placebo.

### Randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study of single-dose guanfacine in unilateral neglect following stroke [^117XLfof]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

Procedure

A stratified crossover protocol was employed, allowing for within-patient comparison between treatment and placebo, while removing between-patient variability. Oral guanfacine (2 mg; as in refs) was encapsulated by Nova Pharmaceuticals, which also provided matching placebo.

Patients were tested on five consecutive days. On days 1, 3 and 5, they were tested on a task battery that consisted of a computerised 'invisible' touchscreen cancellation task, plus independent tests of sustained attentionand spatial working memory (further details below).

On day 2, individuals received active drug or placebo, and on day 4 they received placebo if they had previously received active drug and vice versa. The order of administration of guanfacine and placebo was counterbalanced across patients, according to a pregenerated randomisation scheme. The clinician who administered the drugs and the tests was blind to the randomisation and the drug. The analyses presented here were performed by a different researcher, only after all data were collected. On both treatment days, patients were tested on the task battery twice: once immediately before guanfacine/placebo administration and once 2 hours after. As guanfacine is washed out within ~17 hours, residual effects were not expected to be present by day 4 if individuals had received guanfacine on day 2. Patients reported no side effects.

All patients provided informed written consent.

### Randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study of single-dose guanfacine in unilateral neglect following stroke [^111okGaP]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusion

We conducted a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study examining the effects of a single 2 mg dose of guanfacine, a noradrenergic alpha-2A agonist. Thirteen stroke patients with unilateral neglect were tested on an 'invisible' cancellation paradigm, as well as sustained attention and spatial working memory tasks. A significant improvement in the total number of targets patients found on the cancellation task was observed on guanfacine versus placebo, but there was no evidence for or against beneficial effects of guanfacine on directional bias. Guanfacine did not improve search organisation and did not affect performance on sustained attention or spatial working memory tasks. Further work is now necessary to determine whether regular treatment with guanfacine has beneficial effects on neglect and activities of daily living.

### Randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study of single-dose guanfacine in unilateral neglect following stroke [^117C4LRy]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

Unilateral neglect is a poststroke disorder that impacts negatively on functional outcome and lacks established, effective treatment. This multicomponent syndrome is characterised by a directional bias of attention away from contralesional space, together with impairments in several cognitive domains, including sustained attention and spatial working memory. This study aimed to test the effects of guanfacine, a noradrenergic alpha-2A agonist, on ameliorating aspects of neglect.

Methods

Thirteen right hemisphere stroke patients with leftward neglect were included in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled proof-of-concept crossover study that examined the effects of a single dose of guanfacine. Patients were tested on a computerised, time-limited cancellation paradigm, as well as tasks that independently assessed sustained attention and spatial working memory.

Results

On guanfacine, there was a statistically significant improvement in the total number of targets found on the cancellation task when compared with placebo (mean improvement of 5, out of a possible 64). However, there was no evidence of a change in neglect patients' directional attention bias. Furthermore, Bayesian statistical analysis revealed reliable evidence against any effects of guanfacine on search organisation and performance on our sustained attention and spatial working memory tasks.

Conclusions

Guanfacine improves search in neglect by boosting the number of targets found but had no effects on directional bias or search organisation, nor did it improve sustained attention or working memory on independent tasks. Further work is necessary to determine whether longer term treatment with guanfacine may be effective for some neglect patients and whether it affects functional outcome measures.

### Enhanced pain relief with guanfacine as an adjuvant for trigeminal nerve blocks: insights from a pheWAS-guided randomized controlled study [^114BHWsZ]. Pain Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Results from our PheWAS analysis, as well as the primary literature, support our hypothesis that stimulation of the ADRA2 receptor alone could serve to treat trigeminal nerve pain; however, we designed the study with all patients receiving at least standard lidocaine of care to ensure appropriate equipoise for patients with this severely painful condition. Considering that guanfacine was used in combination with lidocaine, our observations may be attributed to guanfacine alone or to an indirect modulation of lidocaine. Lidocaine inhibits action potential propagation by inhibiting the influx of sodium through voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSC). ADRA2 activation has been shown to reduce cytoplasmic calcium, thereby inhibiting neurotransmitter release. These 2 distinct mechanisms for inhibiting neuronal transmission may act independently or collaboratively to inhibit neuronal transmission. Indeed, it stands to reason that activity on VGSC and ADRA2 may complement one another based on the different target kinetics. Additionally, guanfacine and ADRA2 have known vasoactive effects, which may indirectly affect pain levels through mechanisms such as cell access or duration of drug exposure. However, from this single trial, we cannot conclude whether guanfacine is directly responsible for analgesia. It's possible the observed results were driven by alternative mechanisms, such as delayed lidocaine clearance or enhanced membrane penetration by lidocaine. Future studies are required to better understand the mechanism by which guanfacine acts to provide pain relief.

Introduction

Trigeminal neuralgia and painful trigeminal neuropathy are severely painful conditions affecting the trigeminal nerve, the fifth cranial nerve. The severity of localized acute pain may be a predictor of transition to chronic, widespread pain. Anticonvulsants and antidepressants are used as a first-line treatment, but greater than 40% of patients do not respond. Often, other approaches, including trigeminal nerve injections or blocks, or nerve ablation, are necessary to manage the debilitating pain that affects quality of life; however, these too may not be effective.

Nerve blocks, which may also be referred to as nerve injections, consist of local anesthetics, sometimes with adjuncts, delivered directly onto the trigeminal nerve or its branches, and may relieve pain anywhere from 2 weeks to 14 months, and have therapeutic benefits for patients who are refractory to oral medications. Improvements to the trigeminal nerve block in pain relief intensity or duration would be of benefit, and repurposing of existing drugs could potentially address this need.

The alpha-2 adrenergic receptor (ADRA2) is a G protein-coupled receptor expressed on peripheral and central presynaptic terminals, which has been identified as a promising target for analgesia in humans. ADRA2 activation with selective and potent agonists, such as guanfacine, can lead to the inhibition of calcium influx and neurotransmitter release through inhibitory G protein activity.

We hypothesized that adding guanfacine to routine care nerve blocks would provide better pain relief in trigeminal neuralgia than routine care alone. To test this hypothesis, we performed a proof-of-concept, phase II crossover study for patients with trigeminal neuralgia and painful trigeminal neuropathy. Patients were randomized to receive a routine care injection (lidocaine alone) or routine care plus guanfacine for a trigeminal nerve block.

### Combined stimulant and guanfacine administration in attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder: a controlled, comparative study [^115R9K9v]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

Because models of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) therapeutics emphasize benefits of both enhanced dopaminergic and noradrenergic signaling, strategies to enhance D1 and α2A agonism may yield enhanced clinical and cognitive responses. This study tested the hypothesis that combined effects of a dopamine and noradrenergic agonist, d-methylphenidate extended-release (DMPH) with guanfacine (GUAN), an α2A receptor agonist, would be clinically superior to either monotherapy and would have equal tolerability.

Method

An 8-week, double-blind, 3-arm, comparative trial randomized 7- to 14-year-olds with DSM-IV ADHD to GUAN (1–3 mg/day), DMPH (5–20 mg/day), or a combination (COMB) with fixed-flexible dosing. Outcome measures were the ADHD Rating Scale IV (ADHD-RS-IV) and the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (CGI-I) scale. Data on adverse events and safety measures were obtained.

Results

A total of 207 participants were randomized and received drug. Analyses showed significant treatment group main effects for ADHD-RS-IV ADHD total (p = .0001) and inattentive symptoms (p = .0001). COMB demonstrated small but consistently greater reductions in ADHD-RS-IV Inattentive subscale scores versus monotherapies (DMPH: p = .05; f(2) = .02; and GUAN: p = .02; f(2) = .02), and was associated with a greater positive response rate by CGI-I (p = .01). No serious cardiovascular events occurred. Sedation, somnolence, lethargy, and fatigue were greater in both guanfacine groups. All treatments were well tolerated.

Conclusion

COMB showed consistent evidence of clinical benefits over monotherapies, possibly reflecting advantages of greater combined dopaminergic and α2A agonism. Adverse events were generally mild to moderate, and COMB treatment showed no differences in safety or tolerability.

### Randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study of single-dose guanfacine in unilateral neglect following stroke [^111sH4nF]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

Neglect is considered to be a heterogeneous syndrome, consisting of a core directional bias and additional cognitive deficits that increase clinical severity. As these deficits may not all respond to different therapies, and as neglect severity may vary on a day-to-day basis, novel trial designs might be particularly helpful in determining whether an intervention is efficacious. In particular, we advocate the use of highly precise measures in addition to traditional clinical scales. For example, the invisible cancellation task is more sensitive to neglect symptoms and provides additional information on domains as working memory and executive functioning. This information could inform whether a drug works and what the underlying cognitive mechanism is. It should also be noted that a combination of (pharmacological and behavioural) interventions might prove more efficacious than a single therapy.

Abstract

Background

Trigeminal neuralgia and painful trigeminal neuropathy are severely painful conditions which are often difficult to treat with medications. A Phenome-Wide Association Study (PheWAS) analysis identified an association between single-nucleotide variants in the alpha-2 adrenergic receptor (ADRA2) subtype B, a G protein-coupled receptor expressed on peripheral and central presynaptic terminals, and an increased risk for trigeminal nerve disorders. We hypothesized that adding the ADRA2 agonist guanfacine to routine care trigeminal nerve injections would provide enhanced pain relief in trigeminal neuralgia than routine care alone.

Methods

PheWAS analysis identified the drug target/indication pair. The trial was a single-center, prospective, randomized, controlled, double-blinded, 2-way crossover trial for patients with pain attributed to the trigeminal nerve. Injections of lidocaine alone or lidocaine + 250 µg guanfacine were delivered to the V2 and V3 branches of the trigeminal nerve by experienced clinicians. Patients reported pain using a Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) and quality of life measures (using the PROMIS Global Physical Health, Mental Health, and Pain Interference surveys).

Results

NRS pain scores over the first 8 h post-injection were significantly lower in the interventional group (guanfacine + lidocaine) compared to active control (P < .001), but not from day 1 through day 14. There was no significant difference between treatment groups in time to recovery of baseline pain intensity (primary outcome), PROMIS outcomes, or adverse events (AEs). No serious AEs were reported.

Conclusions

The addition of 250 µg guanfacine to lidocaine for a nerve block procedure enhanced analgesia compared to lidocaine alone within the first 8 h post-injection.

### A randomized, placebo-controlled trial of guanfacine extended release in adolescents with attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder [^111mLcUj]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

Despite the continuity of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) into adolescence, little is known regarding use of nonstimulants to treat ADHD in adolescents. This phase 3 trial evaluated the safety and efficacy of guanfacine extended release (GXR) in adolescents with ADHD.

Method

This 13-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial evaluated once-daily GXR (1–7 mg per day) in adolescents with ADHD aged 13 to 17 years. The primary endpoint was the change from baseline in the ADHD Rating Scale-IV (ADHD-RS-IV) total score; key secondary endpoints included scores from the Clinical Global Impressions-Severity of Illness (CGI-S), and Learning and School domain and Family domain scores from the Weiss Functional Impairment Rating Scale-Parent Report (WFIRS-P) at week 13.

Results

A total of 314 participants were randomized (GXR, n = 157; placebo, n = 157). The majority of participants received optimal doses of 3, 4, 5, or 6 mg (30 [22.9%], 26 [19.8%], 27 [20.6%], or 24 [18.3%] participants, respectively), with 46.5% of participants receiving an optimal dose above the currently approved maximum dose limit of 4 mg. Participants receiving GXR showed improvement in ADHD-RS-IV total score compared with placebo (least-squares mean score change, -24.55 [GXR] versus -18.53 [placebo]; effect size, 0.52; p < .001). More participants on GXR also showed significant improvement in CGI-S scores compared with placebo (50.6% versus 36.1%; p = .010). There was no statistically significant difference between treatments at week 13 in the 2 WFIRS-P domains. Most treatment-emergent adverse events were mild to moderate, with sedation-related events reported most commonly.

Conclusion

GXR was associated with statistically significant improvements in ADHD symptoms in adolescents. GXR was well tolerated, with no new safety signals reported.

### A placebo-controlled study of guanfacine in the treatment of children with tic disorders and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder [^112QYJGY]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of guanfacine in treating children with tic disorders and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).

Method

Subjects from a specialty tic disorders clinic were randomly assigned to receive 8 weeks of treatment with guanfacine or placebo under double-blind conditions. Follow-up visits occurred every 2 weeks for safety monitoring and dose adjustment.

Results

Thirty-four medication-free subjects (31 boys and three girls with a mean age of 10.4 years) with ADHD, combined type, and a tic disorder participated. After 8 weeks of treatment, guanfacine was associated with a mean improvement of 37% in the total score on the teacher-rated ADHD Rating Scale, compared to 8% improvement for placebo. Nine of 17 subjects who received guanfacine were blindly rated on the Clinical Global Improvement scale as either much improved or very much improved, compared with none of 17 subjects who received placebo. The mean score on the parent-rated hyperactivity index improved by 27% in the guanfacine group and 21% in the placebo group, not a significant difference. On the Continuous Performance Test, commission errors decreased by 22% and omission errors by 17% in the guanfacine group, compared with increases of 29% in commission errors and of 31% in omission errors in the placebo group. Tic severity decreased by 31% in the guanfacine group, compared to 0% in the placebo group. One guanfacine subject with sedation withdrew at week 4. Guanfacine was associated with insignificant decreases in blood pressure and pulse.

Conclusions

Guanfacine appears to be a safe and effective treatment for children with tic disorders and ADHD.

10 OVERDOSAGE

Symptoms

Postmarketing reports of guanfacine overdosage indicate that hypotension, drowsiness, lethargy, and bradycardia have been observed following overdose. Initial hypertension may develop early and may be followed by hypotension. Similar symptoms have been described in voluntary reports to the American Association of Poison Control Center's National Poison Data System. Miosis of the pupils may be noted on examination. No fatal overdoses of guanfacine have been reported in published literature.

Treatment

Consult a Certified Poison Control Center by calling 1-800-222-1222 for up-to-date guidance and advice.

Management of guanfacine extended-release tablets overdose should include monitoring for and the treatment of initial hypertension, if that occurs, as well as hypotension, bradycardia, lethargy and respiratory depression. Children and adolescents who develop lethargy should be observed for the development of more serious toxicity including coma, bradycardia and hypotension for up to 24 hours, due to the possibility of delayed onset hypotension.

### Pharmacological treatment for tourette syndrome in children and adults: what is the quality of the evidence? A systematic review [^115Uy4wX]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Tourette syndrome (TS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterised by involuntary muscle movements manifesting as motor and vocal tics. In the majority, tics are manageable without medication. Where tics cause discomfort or impair function, behavioural or pharmaceutical treatments may be considered.

Aims

To provide a meticulous examination of the quality of evidence for the current pharmacological treatments for TS.

Methods

PubMed and Google Scholar were searched to identify randomised, placebo-controlled trials (RCTs) of aripiprazole, risperidone, clonidine, guanfacine, haloperidol, pimozide, tiapride and sulpiride for the treatment of tics in children and adults with TS. Quality of reporting and risk of bias were assessed against the CONSORT checklist and Cochrane risk of bias criteria, respectively.

Results

Seventeen RCTs were identified. Response rates reached 88.6% for aripiprazole, 68.9% for clonidine, 62.5% for risperidone and 19% for guanfacine. Statistically significant improvements were reported for all medications compared to placebo in at least one study and for at least one measure of tic severity. Most studies predated the CONSORT and Cochrane criteria and did not score highly when assessed on these measures.

Conclusions

There are relatively few placebo-controlled trials of commonly prescribed medications. Studies are often of poor quality and short duration. There is evidence for the efficacy of each medication, but no drug is clearly superior. Clonidine and guanfacine are better tolerated than antipsychotics, but less effective. There is too little evidence to determine whether adults respond differently from children.

### Guanfacine (intuniv) for attention-deficit / hyperactivity… [^111aUNeg]. AAFP (2011). Low credibility.

Guanfacine is an extended-release, non–central nervous system stimulant approved for the treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in children six to 17 years of age; however, it appears to be most effective in children 12 years or younger. Similar to clonidine, it works as a selective agonist for the α. Changes on electrocardiography, including bradycardia, are rare but have occurred in clinical trials. Abrupt withdrawal of guanfacine should be avoided to decrease the risk of notable changes in blood pressure. Guanfacine is U. S. Food and Drug Administration pregnancy category B.

1. TOLERABILITY Sedation is common with guanfacine treatment and can be severe in a small number of children. Somnolence and fatigue are also common, affecting 9 to 40 percent of children.

2, 3 These effects generally occur within two to three weeks of starting therapy and tend to decrease over time; most patients report not having these effects by the end of the eight- to nine-week treatment period. 2–4 The dosage should be slowly titrated up to avoid these adverse effects. In clinical trials, 12 percent of patients taking guanfacine discontinued therapy, compared with 4 percent of those taking placebo. EFFECTIVENESS Guanfacine is effective in the short-term treatment of ADHD. Dosages of 1 to 4 mg per day decrease scores on the ADHD Rating Scale-IV by an average of 17 to 21 points, compared with a decrease of 9 to 12 points with placebo. 2, 3 When adjusted for age, the changes in ADHD Rating Scale-IV scores were not statistically significant compared with the placebo group in patients 13 to 17 years of age, but were for patients six to 12 years of age. 2, 3 Therefore, effectiveness in children 13 to 17 years of age is questionable.

The duration of action of guanfacine, at least at lower dosages, is no more than eight hours, and higher dosages may be needed to produce sustained effectiveness. 2, 3 Guanfacine has not been compared directly with other ADHD medications, including psychostimulant medications, clonidine, and atomoxetine.

### Enhanced pain relief with guanfacine as an adjuvant for trigeminal nerve blocks: insights from a pheWAS-guided randomized controlled study [^116CDcue]. Pain Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Trigeminal neuralgia and painful trigeminal neuropathy are severely painful conditions which are often difficult to treat with medications. A Phenome-Wide Association Study (PheWAS) analysis identified an association between single nucleotide variants in the alpha-2 adrenergic receptor (ADRA2) subtype B, a G protein-coupled receptor expressed on peripheral and central presynaptic terminals, and an increased risk for trigeminal nerve disorders. We hypothesized that adding the ADRA2 agonist guanfacine to routine care trigeminal nerve injections would provide enhanced pain relief in trigeminal neuralgia than routine care alone.

Methods

PheWAS analysis identified the drug target/indication pair. The trial was a single-center, prospective, randomized, controlled, double-blinded, two-way crossover trial for patients with pain attributed to the trigeminal nerve. Injections of lidocaine alone or lidocaine + 250µg guanfacine were delivered to the V2 and V3 branches of the trigeminal nerve by experienced clinicians. Patients reported pain using a Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) and quality of life measures (using the PROMIS Global Physical Health, Mental Health, and Pain Interference surveys).

Results

NRS pain scores over the first 8hours post-injection were significantly lower in the interventional group (guanfacine + lidocaine) compared to active control (p < 0.001), but not from day 1 through day 14. There was no significant difference between treatment groups in time to recovery of baseline pain intensity (primary outcome), PROMIS outcomes, or adverse events. No serious adverse events were reported.

Conclusions

The addition of 250µg guanfacine to lidocaine for a nerve block procedure enhanced analgesia compared to lidocaine alone within the first 8hours post-injection.

### Enhanced pain relief with guanfacine as an adjuvant for trigeminal nerve blocks: insights from a pheWAS-guided randomized controlled study [^113vZDG9]. Pain Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this study, we utilized a novel approach by leveraging PheWAS to discover a potential new use for an approved drug. The PheWAS analysis identified trigeminal nerve disorders as a phenotype that would potentially benefit from an ADRA2 agonist, leading to our randomized crossover trial of guanfacine in trigeminal neuralgia. This study showed that the addition of guanfacine to lidocaine for a nerve block enhanced analgesia during the first 8 h post-injection, and did not significantly increase the number of AEs compared to the active control group. We did not observe any effect on PROMIS Global Health, Global Mental, or Pain Interference. This study supports guanfacine as an adjunct to lidocaine in nerve block procedures to treat trigeminal neuralgia or painful trigeminal neuropathy, although we acknowledge these data are not sufficient to cause a widespread change in clinical practice.

In our study, we recruited patients who best fit diagnostic criteria for trigeminal neuralgia as well as painful trigeminal neuropathy based on the clinical presentation of their pain. While technically the diagnosis of secondary trigeminal neuralgia with continuous background pain can be difficult to distinguish from painful trigeminal neuropathy, in those cases where a peripheral injury to the nerve cannot be easily confirmed, the latter diagnosis is reasonable. Furthermore, in clinical practice, a patient may initially present with a primarily paroxysmal trigeminal pain, but after years of chronic pain leading to central sensitization, and interventions or surgeries which can mechanically affect the nerve itself, the patient's pain phenotype may evolve and be better represented by the painful trigeminal neuropathy diagnosis. As such, we recruited patients with both of these diagnoses to better represent the population of those with trigeminal pain.

In our study, we chose a dose of 250 µg of guanfacine. Guanfacine has been shown to have a similar potency to clonidine, which is used at a dose of 30–300 µg as an adjuvant for extending the analgesia in regional blocks with local anesthetics in the perioperative period. Guanfacine, which has about 80% oral bioavailability, is used up to 4 mg per day for hypertension, and up to 7 mg per day in the extended-release formulation in the treatment of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children. The dose used in our trial was significantly lower than any oral dose and was administered locally rather than orally. Future dose-finding and mechanistic studies on local pharmacodynamics and metabolism should be considered for the use of guanfacine in the treatment of pain.

### Pediatric guanfacine exposures reported to the national poison data system, 2000–2016 [^116uKu9a]. Clinical Toxicology (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction: The purpose of this study was to characterize the frequency, reasons for exposure, clinical manifestations, treatments, duration of effects, and medical outcomes of pediatric guanfacine exposures reported to the National Poison Data System (NPDS) from 2000 to 2016. Methods: Data extracted from poison control center call records for pediatric (0–5 years, 6–12 years, and 13–19 years), single-substance guanfacine ingestions reported to NPDS between 2000 and 2016 was retrospectively analyzed. Results: A total of 10927 cases were identified for analysis. Pediatric single-substance guanfacine exposures reported to NPDS increased significantly during the study period, with a marked increase among 6-12-year-olds. The most commonly documented clinical effects across age groups were drowsiness (n = 4262, 39%), bradycardia (n = 1696, 15.5%), and hypotension (n = 1127, 10.3%). The duration of effect for most cases was > 8hours but ≤ 24hours (n = 2395, 44.2%). The median documented quantity of guanfacine ingested was 0.11mg/kg (range: 0.004–7.8mg/kg). The difference between mg/kg ingested in no effect and minor effect groups compared to moderate and major effect groups was statistically significant in all three age groups. Conclusions: Pediatric guanfacine exposures reported to U.S. poison centers have increased significantly in the last fifteen years. The most common clinical findings secondary to guanfacine exposure were bradycardia, hypotension, and CNS depression. There was a statistically significant difference between the mg/kg of guanfacine ingested in the groups experiencing no effect or mild effect compared to moderate or major effects. However, the maximum ingested dose reported among 0-5-year-olds in the no effect group was 2.72mg/kg, while the minimum dose eliciting a major effect in both 0–5 and 6-12-year-olds was 0.05mg/kg. The overall incidence of major effects was very low, with the vast majority of patients experiencing minor symptoms or less. Based on this data, we agree with current recommendations that any symptomatic pediatric patient exposed to guanfacine should be observed in a health care facility for at least 24hours.

### Randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study of single-dose guanfacine in unilateral neglect following stroke [^113HA1J9]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

To further explore the possible beneficial effects of noradrenergic stimulation in neglect, we conducted a larger proof-of-concept, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover investigation of the effects of a single dose of guanfacine. In this within-participant design, participants were assessed over five consecutive days. To investigate spatial exploration, we employed an invisible cancellation task. In contrast to the previous study of guanfacine in neglect, we set a fixed time limit to rule out the possibility that patients find more targets due to extended search durations. In addition, independent tests of sustained attention and working memory were administered. A secondary objective was to observe whether guanfacine might improve neglect only in patients without significant damage to prefrontal cortex.

### Guanfacine extended release: a novel treatment for attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents [^112RHjky]. Clinical Therapeutics (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Guanfacine extended release (GXR) has reported efficacy for the treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) as monotherapy and adjunctive therapy to psychostimulant medications.

Objective

The objective of this article was to review the efficacy, safety profile, mechanism of action, pharmacokinetics, and appropriate dosing of GXR in children and adolescents with ADHD.

Methods

Pertinent English-language literature was identified from searches of MEDLINE (1950-February 2012), BIOSIS (1969-February 2012), and EMBASE (1974-February 2012). Search terms included guanfacine, guanfacine extended release, attention deficit disorder with hyperactivity, ADHD, nonstimulant, and alpha-2 adrenergic receptor. Of the 49 publications identified, 12 are reviewed herein. Citations from identified articles were reviewed for additional references. Abstracts and posters presented at recent scientific meetings and data included in the prescribing information were also reviewed.

Results

Studies of GXR have demonstrated efficacy as once-daily monotherapy as well as adjunctive therapy to psychostimulants for ADHD in short-term trials. The safety profile of GXR is consistent with that of a centrally acting α2A-adrenoceptor agonist. Somnolence, sedation, and hypersomnia adverse events (AEs), although frequent, are typically mild to moderate and tend to diminish with continued treatment. However, 1 long-term, open-label study found that 22 serious treatment-emergent AEs occurred in 16 (6.2%) of 259 subjects, and another found that 26% of subjects discontinued therapy due to AEs. The cardiovascular effects, of GXR are consistent with guanfacine's known effects, and are generally modest in nature. The mechanism of action of GXR in ADHD is unknown. Because the pharmacokinetics of immediate-release guanfacine differ from GXR, dose substitution on a milligram-for-milligram basis is inappropriate. Clinical trials analyzed according to weight-adjusted doses suggest a dose-response relationship for efficacy. Doses > 4 mg/d cannot be recommended due to lack of study data at those doses.

Conclusions

Current evidence indicates that GXR is an effective treatment option for children and adolescents with ADHD. AEs are typically mild to moderate, although severe AEs and discontinuations due to AEs have been observed.

Studies 4, 5, and 6: Flexible-dose INTUNIV Monotherapy

Study 4 (314 study) was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, dose-optimization study, in which efficacy of once daily dosing (morning or evening) with INTUNIV (1 mg, 2 mg, 3 mg, and 4 mg) was evaluated for 8 weeks in children aged 6 to 12 years (n = 340).

Signs and symptoms of ADHD were evaluated on a once weekly basis using the clinician administered and scored ADHD Rating Scale (ADHD-RS-IV), which includes both hyperactive/impulsive and inattentive subscales. The primary efficacy outcome was the change from baseline score at endpoint on the ADHD-RS-IV total scores. Endpoint was defined as the last post-randomization treatment week for which a valid score was obtained prior to dose tapering (up to Week 8).

Mean reductions in ADHD-RS-IV total scores at endpoint were statistically significantly greater for INTUNIV compared to placebo in both AM and PM dosing groups of INTUNIV (see Table 17).

Study 5 (312 study) was a 15-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, dose-optimization study conducted in adolescents aged 13 to 17 years (n = 314) to evaluate the efficacy and safety of INTUNIV (1 to 7 mg/day; optimized dose range of 0.05 to 0.12 mg/kg/day) in the treatment of ADHD as measured by the ADHD Rating Scale-IV (ADHD-RS-IV). Patients receiving INTUNIV showed statistically significantly greater improvement on the ADHD-RS-IV total score compared with patients receiving placebo (see Table 17).

Study 6 (316 study) was a 12-week (for children aged 6 to 12) or 15-week (for adolescents aged 13 to 17), randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo- and active-reference, dose-optimization study conducted in pediatric patients (children and adolescents aged 6 to 17 years old inclusive) (n = 337) to assess the efficacy and safety of once-daily dosing (children: 1 to 4 mg/day, adolescents: 1 to 7 mg/day; optimized dose range of 0.05 to 0.12 mg/kg/day) in the treatment of ADHD. INTUNIV was statistically superior to placebo on symptoms of ADHD in patients 6 to 17 years as measured by change from baseline in ADHD-RS-IV total scores (see Table 17).

8.4 Pediatric Use

Safety and efficacy of INTUNIV in pediatric patients less than 6 years of age have not been established. The efficacy of INTUNIV was studied for the treatment of ADHD in five controlled monotherapy clinical trials (up to 15 weeks in duration), one randomized withdrawal study and one controlled adjunctive trial with psychostimulants (8 weeks in duration) in children and adolescents ages 6 to 17 who met DSM-IV®criteria for ADHD [see Adverse Reactions (6) and Clinical Studies (14)].

Animal Data

In studies in juvenile rats, guanfacine alone produced a slight delay in sexual maturation in males and females at 2 to 3 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD). Guanfacine in combination with methylphenidate produced a slight delay in sexual maturation and decreased growth as measured by a decrease in bone length in males at a dose of guanfacine comparable to the MRHD and a dose of methylphenidate approximately 4 times the MRHD.

In a study where juvenile rats were treated with guanfacine alone from 7 to 59 days of age, development was delayed as indicated by a slight delay in sexual maturation and decreased body weight gain in males at 2 mg/kg/day and in females at 3 mg/kg/day. The No Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) for delayed sexual maturation was 1 mg/kg/day, which is equivalent to the MRHD of 4 mg/day, on a mg/m2basis. The effects on fertility were not evaluated in this study.

In a study where juvenile rats were treated with guanfacine in combination with methylphenidate from 7 to 59 days of age, a decrease in ulna bone length and a slight delay in sexual maturation were observed in males given 1 mg/kg/day of guanfacine in combination with 50 mg/kg/day of methylphenidate. The NOAELs for these findings were 0.3 mg/kg of guanfacine in combination with 16 mg/kg/day of methylphenidate, which are equivalent to 0.3 and 1.4 times the MRHD of 4 mg/day and 54 mg/day for guanfacine and methylphenidate, respectively, on a mg/m2basis. These findings were not observed with guanfacine alone at 1 mg/kg/day or methylphenidate alone at 50 mg/kg/day.

### Efficacy and safety of guanfacine extended-release in the treatment of attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder in adults: results of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study [^112JiomE]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To assess guanfacine extended-release (GXR) efficacy and safety in adults with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).

Methods

This phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (conducted between October 2016 and July 2017) included Japanese patients aged ≥ 18 years with ADHD (DSM-5). Patients received GXR (n = 101) or placebo (n = 100) titrated from 2 mg/d to 4–6 mg/d (dose-optimization; 5 weeks), followed by 4–6 mg/d (dose-maintenance; 5 weeks), then tapered doses to 2 mg/d (2 weeks). Primary endpoint was change from baseline in total score on the Japanese version of the ADHD-Rating Scale IV with adult prompts (ADHD-RS-IV) at week 10. Other measures were ADHD-RS-IV subscales, Clinical Global Impression-Improvement scale (CGI-I) and Patient Global Impression-Improvement scale (PGI-I) (percentage of patients very much improved/much improved), treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) incidences, and TEAEs leading to discontinuation.

Results

Compared with placebo, there was statistically significantly greater improvement in ADHD-RS-IV total score reduction with GXR (least squares mean ± SE: GXR vs placebo, -11.55 ± 1.10 vs -7.27 ± 1.07; P = 0.0005; effect size 0.52). There were significantly greater improvements in GXR for ADHD-RS-IV inattention (-7.39 ± 0.79 vs -4.89 ± 0.76; P = 0.0032) and hyperactivity-impulsivity (-3.84 ± 0.54 vs -2.10 ± 0.52; P = 0.0021) subscale scores, CGI-I scores (48.1% vs 22.6%; P = 0.0007), and PGI-I scores (25.3% vs 11.8%; P = 0.0283). More patients in the GXR versus the placebo group reported TEAEs (81.2% vs 62.0%) and discontinued due to TEAEs (19.8% vs 3.0%). The main TEAEs in the GXR group were somnolence, thirst, blood pressure decrease, nasopharyngitis, postural dizziness, and constipation; most TEAEs were mild to moderate in severity.

Conclusions

In Japanese adults with ADHD, GXR improved ADHD symptoms without any major safety concerns.

### Guanfacine hydrochloride (Guanfacine) [^112NHaNW]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

General

Like other antihypertensive agents, guanfacine hydrochloride should be used with caution in patients with severe coronary insufficiency, recent myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular disease, or chronic renal or hepatic failure.

Sedation: Guanfacine, like other orally active central α2-adrenergic agonists, causes sedation or drowsiness, especially when beginning therapy. These symptoms are dose-related (see ADVERSE REACTIONS). When guanfacine is used with other centrally active depressants (such as phenothiazines, barbiturates, or benzodiazepines), the potential for additive sedative effects should be considered.

Rebound: Abrupt cessation of therapy with orally active central α2-adrenergic agonists may be associated with increases (from depressed on-therapy levels) in plasma and urinary catecholamines, symptoms of "nervousness and anxiety" and, less commonly, increases in blood pressure to levels significantly greater than those prior to therapy.

Information for Patients

Patients who receive guanfacine should be advised to exercise caution when operating dangerous machinery or driving motor vehicles until it is determined that they do not become drowsy or dizzy from the medication. Patients should be warned that their tolerance for alcohol and other CNS depressants may be diminished. Patients should be advised not to discontinue therapy abruptly.

Laboratory Tests

In clinical trials, no clinically relevant laboratory test abnormalities were identified as causally related to drug during short-term treatment with guanfacine hydrochloride.

### Guanfacine (guanfacine extended-release) [^112i8vyR]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Signs and symptoms of ADHD were evaluated on a once weekly basis using the clinician administered and scored ADHD Rating Scale (ADHD-RS-IV), which includes both hyperactive/impulsive and inattentive subscales. The primary efficacy outcome was the change from baseline to endpoint in ADHD-RS-IV total scores. Endpoint was defined as the last post-randomization treatment week for which a valid score was obtained prior to dose tapering (up to Week 5 in Study 1 and up to Week 6 in Study 2).

The mean reductions in ADHD-RS-IV total scores at endpoint were statistically significantly greater for guanfacine extended-release tablets compared to placebo for Studies 1 and 2. Placebo-adjusted changes from baseline were statistically significant for each of the 2 mg, 3 mg, and 4 mg guanfacine extended-release tablets randomized treatment groups in both studies, as well as the 1 mg guanfacine extended-release tablets treatment group that was included only in Study 2 (see Table 16).

Dose-responsive efficacy was evident, particularly when data were examined on a weight-adjusted (mg/kg) basis. When evaluated over the dose range of 0.01 to 0.17 mg/kg/day, clinically relevant improvements were observed beginning at doses in the range 0.05 to 0.08 mg/kg/day. Doses up to 0.12 mg/kg/day were shown to provide additional benefit.

10 OVERDOSAGE

Symptoms

Postmarketing reports of guanfacine overdosage indicate that hypotension, drowsiness, lethargy, and bradycardia have been observed following overdose. Initial hypertension may develop early and may be followed by hypotension. Similar symptoms have been described in voluntary reports to the American Association of Poison Control Center's National Poison Data System. Miosis of the pupils may be noted on examination. No fatal overdoses of guanfacine have been reported in published literature.

Treatment

Consult a Certified Poison Control Center by calling 1-800-222-1222 for up-to-date guidance and advice.

Management of INTUNIV overdose should include monitoring for and the treatment of initial hypertension, if that occurs, as well as hypotension, bradycardia, lethargy, and respiratory depression. Children and adolescents who develop lethargy should be observed for the development of more serious toxicity including coma, bradycardia, and hypotension for up to 24 hours, due to the possibility of delayed onset hypotension.

### Randomized, double-blind trial of guanfacine extended release in children with attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder: morning or evening administration [^112yaB7T]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine the efficacy and tolerability of guanfacine extended release (GXR) administered in the morning or evening in children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).

Method

In this multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-optimization study, children 6 to 12 years of age with ADHD were randomized to receive GXR (1–4 mg/d) in the morning and placebo in the evening (GXR am), placebo in the morning and GXR in the evening (GXR pm), or twice-daily placebo. The primary efficacy measure was the ADHD Rating Scale-IV (ADHD-RS-IV).

Results

A total of 333 child participants received study drug in the following cohorts: GXR am (n = 107), GXR pm (n = 114), or placebo (n = 112). Mean (standard deviation) changes from baseline to week 8 (visit 10 or last observation carried forward) in ADHD-RS-IV total scores were significant for both GXR treatment groups combined (GXR all-active: -20.0 [12.97]) and separately (GXR am: -19.8 [12.95]; GXR pm: -20.1 [13.04]) compared with placebo (-11.0 [12.93]; p < .001 for all). Most spontaneously-elicited treatment-emergent adverse events were mild or moderate in severity; the most common was somnolence (GXR all-active: 44.3%; GXR am: 46.7%; GXR pm: 42.1%; placebo: 12.5%).

Conclusions

GXR administered either in the morning or evening was associated with significant and clinically meaningful improvements in ADHD symptoms. The levels of response and tolerability observed with GXR were similar regardless of time of dosing (morning versus evening), indicating that once-daily GXR monotherapy is effective whether administered in the morning or evening.

### Enhanced pain relief with guanfacine as an adjuvant for trigeminal nerve blocks: insights from a pheWAS-guided randomized controlled study [^115hYQxP]. Pain Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

The effects of the study drug on the PROMIS Global Health physical health, mental health, and pain interference scores (measured at pre-injection and days 7 and 14 after injection) were quantified using mixed effects linear regression. The effect of time was modeled as a categorical variable (day 7 or day 14), and the treatment effect was allowed to vary with time by including a time-by-treatment interaction. The analysis adjusted for pre-injection score (linear relationship) and accounted for repeated measures using a random intercept indexed by study participant. The results of these analyses were summarized graphically and by testing the null hypothesis that the treatment had no effect at either time point using a 2 degree-of-freedom test. Similar procedures were used to assess the study drug's effect on the frequency of pain attacks (measured at days 7 and 14 after injection) and AEs, using proportional odds or standard logistic regression, but these analyses were not adjusted for baseline factors.

The sample size was selected a priori to achieve at least 80% power to detect a 20% or greater increase in the time to return of baseline pain (primary outcome) after treatment with lidocaine plus guanfacine as an adjuvant (treatment group).

### Randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study of single-dose guanfacine in unilateral neglect following stroke [^112V7u7X]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

Here we investigated whether a single 2 mg dose of guanfacine, an alpha-2A adrenoreceptor agonist, has beneficial effects for patients who suffer from unilateral neglect. By supplementing frequentist with Bayesian statistics, we aimed to establish whether any null effects were due to guanfacine not being different from placebo, or simply due to a lack of statistical power. Our results indicate that guanfacine, when compared with baseline and placebo, led to a significant improvement in the total number of targets found on a touchscreen cancellation task (mean of 5 out of a possible 64 targets) in which patients have to keep track of previously found locations (figure 2). However, there was no conclusive evidence as to whether guanfacine improved directional bias. Specifically, there was moderate evidence that there was no effect of guanfacine on the difference between the number of cancellations on the right and left sides of the task, but there was no conclusive evidence for or against an effect of guanfacine on the centre of cancellation. There was also no conclusive evidence for guanfacine affecting revisits.

There was moderate evidence for the absence of an effect of guanfacine on search organisation, operationalised with four indices. In addition, we found moderate to strong evidence that guanfacine does not improve response time variability, but no conclusive evidence of whether it affects signal detection on a sustained attention task. Finally, there was strong evidence that guanfacine does not improve spatial working memory.

This study follows on directly from a previous investigation in which three neglect patients were tested on an identical but time-unlimited 'invisible' cancellation task. A beneficial effect of guanfacine was found for two patients without frontal involvement. This manifested as a larger number of targets found plus increased time-on-task. These findings could have been caused by improvement in either or both the directional bias and sustained attention components of neglect. In this larger sample of 13 neglect patients, we again found an increase in the number of targets found on the same computerised visual search paradigm following guanfacine. However, we could not demonstrate statistical evidence for a simultaneous reduction in directional bias on guanfacine. A larger study with more statistical power could potentially address this.

2.4 Maintenance Treatment

Pharmacological treatment of ADHD may be needed for extended periods. Healthcare providers should periodically re-evaluate the long-term use of guanfacine extended-release tablets, and adjust weight-based dosage as needed. The majority of children and adolescents reach optimal doses in the 0.05 to 0.12 mg/kg/day range. Doses above 4 mg/day have not been evaluated in children (ages 6 to 12 years) and above 7 mg/day have not been evaluated in adolescents (ages 13 to 17 years) [see Clinical Studies (14)].

2.5 Discontinuation of Treatment

Following discontinuation of guanfacine extended-release tablets, patients may experience increases in blood pressure and heart rate [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) and Adverse Reactions (6)]. Patients/caregivers should be instructed not to discontinue guanfacine extended-release tablets without consulting their health care provider. Monitor blood pressure and pulse when reducing the dose or discontinuing the drug. Taper the daily dose in decrements of no more than 1 mg every 3 to 7 days to minimize the risk of rebound hypertension.

2.6 Missed Doses

When reinitiating patients to the previous maintenance dose after two or more missed consecutive doses, consider titration based on patient tolerability.

2.7 Dosage Adjustment with Concomitant Use of Strong and Moderate CYP3A4 Inhibitors or Inducers

Dosage adjustments for guanfacine extended-release tablets are recommended with concomitant use of strong and moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole), or CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., carbamazepine) (Table 2) [see Drug Interactions (7)].

### Cognitive effects of stimulant, guanfacine, and combined Treatment in child and adolescent attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder [^111LUMgE]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

Psychostimulants are partially effective in reducing cognitive dysfunction associated with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Cognitive effects of guanfacine, an alternative treatment, are poorly understood. Given its distinct action on α2A receptors, guanfacine may have different or complementary effects relative to stimulants. This study tested stimulant and guanfacine monotherapies relative to combined treatment on cognitive functions important in ADHD.

Method

Children with ADHD (n = 182; aged 7–14 years) completed an 8-week, double blind, randomized, controlled trial with 3 arms: d-methylphenidate (DMPH), guanfacine (GUAN), or combination treatment with DMPH and GUAN (COMB). A nonclinical comparison group (n = 93) had baseline testing, and a subset was retested 8 weeks later (n = 38). Analyses examined treatment effects in 4 cognitive domains (working memory, response inhibition, reaction time, and reaction time variability) constructed from 20 variables.

Results

The ADHD group showed impaired working memory relative to the nonclinical comparison group (effect size = -0.53 SD unit). The treatments differed in effects on working memory but not other cognitive domains. Combination treatment improved working memory more than GUAN but was not significantly better than DMPH alone. Treatment did not fully normalize the initial deficit in ADHD relative to the comparison group.

Conclusion

Combined treatment with DMPH and GUAN yielded greater improvements in working memory than placebo or GUAN alone, but the combined treatment was not superior to DMPH alone and did not extend to other cognitive domains. Although GUAN may be a useful add-on treatment to psychostimulants, additional strategies appear to be necessary to achieve normalization of cognitive function in ADHD.

### Guanfacine (Intuniv) [^114TaUjT]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14	CLINICAL STUDIES

Efficacy of INTUNIV in the treatment of ADHD was established in children and adolescents (6 to 17 years) in:

Five short-term, placebo-controlled monotherapy trials (Studies 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6).
One short-term, placebo-controlled adjunctive trial with psychostimulants (Study 3).
One long-term, placebo-controlled monotherapy maintenance trial (Study 7).

Studies 1 and 2: Fixed-dose INTUNIV Monotherapy

Study 1 (301 study) was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, fixed-dose study, in which efficacy of once daily dosing with INTUNIV (2 mg, 3 mg, and 4 mg) was evaluated for 5 weeks (n = 345) in children and adolescents aged 6 to 17 years. Study 2 (304 study) was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, fixed-dose study, in which efficacy of once daily dosing with INTUNIV (1 mg, 2 mg, 3 mg, and 4 mg) was evaluated for 6 weeks (n = 324) in children and adolescents aged 6 to 17 years. In both studies, randomized patients in 2 mg, 3 mg, and 4 mg dose groups were titrated to their target fixed dose, and continued on the same dose until a dose tapering phase started. The lowest dose of 1 mg used in Study 2 was not randomized to patients weighing more than 50 kg. Patients who weighed less than 25 kg were not included in either study.

Signs and symptoms of ADHD were evaluated on a once weekly basis using the clinician administered and scored ADHD Rating Scale (ADHD-RS-IV), which includes both hyperactive/impulsive and inattentive subscales. The primary efficacy outcome was the change from baseline to endpoint in ADHD-RS-IV total scores. Endpoint was defined as the last post-randomization treatment week for which a valid score was obtained prior to dose tapering (up to Week 5 in Study 1 and up to Week 6 in Study 2).

### Enhanced pain relief with guanfacine as an adjuvant for trigeminal nerve blocks: insights from a pheWAS-guided randomized controlled study [^114awnX6]. Pain Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Safety profile and outcomes

Of the 37 participants in the study, 9 had a diagnosis of trigeminal neuralgia, and 28 had a diagnosis of painful trigeminal neuropathy. Eight AEs were reported across 8 different participants (Table 2). There was no statistically significant difference in the rate of AEs following study drug injection versus active control (P = 0.744). Among participants who completed an injection with lidocaine + guanfacine, 13.8% (4/29) experienced an AE within 2 weeks of the procedure. Among participants who completed an injection with lidocaine only, 11.1% (4/36) experienced an AE. No AEs led to treatment discontinuation. No serious AEs were reported.

Table 2.
Summary of AEs.

There was insufficient evidence in the data to determine whether treatment affected time to recovery of baseline pain (primary outcome; hazard ratio: 0.95, 95% CI: 0.36, 1.54, P = 0.870).

Longitudinal analysis of NRS pain scores showed a significant difference between treatment groups (P < .001). NRS pain scores over the first 8 h post-injection were significantly lower in the interventional group (guanfacine + lidocaine) compared to active control, reaching a maximum difference of 1.02 NRS units (95% CI: 0.70, 1.33) at approximately 4.5 h after injection and waning afterward (Figure 5A). Beyond 48 h after injection, the estimated difference was no larger than 0.23 units (95% CI: −0.31, 0.76) (Figure 5B). Longitudinal analysis of participant use of rescue medication showed no significant difference between treatment groups within the first 8 h post-injection or through day 14 (P = 0.657, Figure 5C and D).

### Guanfacine (Intuniv) [^113LvrdG]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

The mean reductions in ADHD-RS-IV total scores at endpoint were statistically significantly greater for INTUNIV compared to placebo for Studies 1 and 2. Placebo-adjusted changes from baseline were statistically significant for each of the 2 mg, 3 mg, and 4 mg INTUNIV randomized treatment groups in both studies, as well as the 1 mg INTUNIV treatment group that was included only in Study 2 (see Table 16).

Dose-responsive efficacy was evident, particularly when data were examined on a weight-adjusted (mg/kg) basis. When evaluated over the dose range of 0.01 to 0.17 mg/kg/day, clinically relevant improvements were observed beginning at doses in the range 0.05 to 0.08 mg/kg/day. Doses up to 0.12 mg/kg/day were shown to provide additional benefit.

In the monotherapy trials (Studies 1 and 2), subgroup analyses were performed to identify any differences in response based on gender or age (6 to 12 vs. 13 to 17). Analyses of the primary outcome did not suggest any differential responsiveness on the basis of gender. Analyses by age revealed a statistically significant treatment effect only in the 6 to 12 age subgroup. Due to the relatively small proportion of adolescent patients (ages 13 to 17) enrolled into these studies (approximately 25%), these data may not have been sufficient to demonstrate efficacy in the adolescent patients. In these studies, patients were randomized to a fixed dose of INTUNIV rather than optimized by body weight. Therefore, some adolescent patients were randomized to a dose that might have resulted in relatively lower plasma guanfacine concentrations compared to the younger patients. Over half (55%) of the adolescent patients received doses of 0.01 to 0.04 mg/kg. In studies in which systematic pharmacokinetic data were obtained, there was a strong inverse correlation between body weight and plasma guanfacine concentrations.

### Attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder medication consumption in 64 countries and regions from 2015 to 2019: a longitudinal study [^1137eDhM]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Guanfacine, an alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonist, was the fastest-growing ADHD medication during the study period. An extended-release formulation of guanfacine was first approved as a treatment for ADHD in the US in 2009. It has since been approved in several other countries. In contrast, clonidine, another alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonist, licensed for ADHD as the extended-release formulation, is only available in five countries. Although immediate-release clonidine is used off-label in some countries, our study did not capture this data. There have been far fewer studies examining the safety and tolerability of clonidine and guanfacine than stimulants and atomoxetine. A recent network meta-analysis reported less precise estimates with wide CIs when evaluating the efficacy and tolerability of these medications, leading to uncertainty when interpreting the results. This highlights the need for larger and longer-term studies that monitor the safety of these recently approved medications. Despite its fast growth, consumption rates of guanfacine remained low compared with stimulants. Following guanfacine, amphetamines had the second-highest annual increase in consumption. Northern and Western Europe had the highest regional annual increase in amphetamines consumption during the study period. In non-US countries, this was likely due to the recent approval of lisdexamfetamine, an amphetamine prodrug, where previously only dexamfetamine's immediate release was available. In children and adolescents, amphetamines may have moderately greater efficacy than methylphenidate in ADHD, whereas methylphenidate may have higher tolerability. However, there is no conclusive clinical evidence to date to support a prospective choice for amphetamines over methylphenidate or vice versa or how individual differences may contribute to differential treatment responses. In addition, a recent study reported that amphetamine use was associated with a greater risk of psychosis than methylphenidate. More studies of direct comparisons between stimulant medications, particularly those that look at differential responses at an individual level are required to inform current guidelines.

### Randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study of single-dose guanfacine in unilateral neglect following stroke [^115WV9mp]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

Although there is evidence for the beneficial effects of guanfacine on working memory in monkeysand healthy humans, we found no conclusive evidence that it reduced revisit rates on the 'invisible' cancellation task. In addition, there was strong evidence that guanfacine did not affect accuracy on a vertical spatial working memory task.

One interpretation of the findings of Malhotra and colleaguesis that guanfacine boosted sustained attention, which caused patients to perform the task for longer, increasing the chance that they found more targets, without any direct effect on directional bias. This is partly supported by the observation that one patient whose search improved with guanfacine also showed improvement on a separate non-lateralised sustained attention test. However, we found moderate statistical evidence for the absence of an effect of treatment type on sustained attention. Given that we employed a strict time limit for the touchscreen search task, guanfacine cannot have exerted its effects by modulating time-on-task in the current study. However, it is still possible that guanfacine improved alertness and generalised arousal leading to more targets found within the time available. This might also account for the lack of any effect on lateralised bias.

Stroke patients with neglect are more likely to also suffer from disorganised search, and some have argued that this is a consequence of disturbed spatial attention. Across four indices of search organisation, we found moderate statistical evidence that guanfacine did not result in any improvements.

The previous study of guanfacine in neglect tentatively suggested that guanfacine's effects might have longer lasting effects than its 17 hours wash-out period would suggest, on the basis of one patient doing relatively well on tests 1 week after guanfacine administration. No such effects appear in the current data.

The current study provides further evidence that guanfacine modulates search in neglect. However, the benefit is relatively small and appears in a highly sensitive test, leaving the exact clinical value unclear. To demonstrate a convincing role for noradrenergic therapies, it is essential to evaluate longer term treatment in this group, as at present, there is only single-case level evidence that regular guanfacine may be effective in reducing attentional impairment caused by neurological disease. Moreover, given that the effect we observed was relatively modest, any further study might also profitably explore the effects of increasing drug dose. In ADHD, the recommended maximum daily dose is 0.12 mg/kg compared with the total 2 mg dose used here.

### Response / remission with guanfacine extended-release and psychostimulants in children and adolescents with attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder [^117Y2ohq]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

In this post hoc analysis, we assessed whether guanfacine extended-release (GXR) adjunctive to a psychostimulant resulted in greater response and remission rates than placebo + psychostimulant in children and adolescents with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).

Method

In this 9-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled dose-optimization study, participants (N = 461) aged 6 to 17 years with suboptimal response to psychostimulants were randomized to GXR on awakening (AM) + psychostimulant, GXR at bedtime (PM) + psychostimulant, or placebo + psychostimulant.

Results

At the final on-treatment assessment, more participants in both GXR + psychostimulant groups versus the placebo + psychostimulant group achieved response as assessed by 2 criteria: reduction from baseline in ADHD Rating Scale IV (ADHD-RS-IV) total score (1) ≥ 40% (GXR AM + psychostimulant = 69.8%, GXR PM + psychostimulant = 70.3%, versus placebo + psychostimulant = 57.9%; p = .032 and p = .026, respectively), or (2) ≥ 50% (63.1%, 64.9%, versus 43.4%; p < .001 for both). Results were similar for symptomatic remission (ADHD-RS-IV total score ≤ 18; 61.1%, 62.2%, versus 46.1%; p = .010 and p = .005, respectively) and syndromal remission (symptomatic remission plus Clinical Global Impressions of Severity of Illness score ≤ 2). The most common treatment-emergent adverse events in participants receiving GXR + psychostimulant were headache (21.2%) and somnolence (13.6%).

Conclusion

GXR + psychostimulant treatment resulted in a greater percentage of participants meeting stringent criteria for response and remission compared with placebo + psychostimulant. The adverse event profile of adjunctive therapy was consistent with known effects of either treatment alone.

### Common practical questions-and answers-at the British Association for Psychopharmacology child and adolescent psychopharmacology course [^111W8QUn]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Medium credibility.

When clonidine is being used in higher doses is it best to go beyond treatment window or consider a switch to guanfacine? If switching, is it best to reduce and withdraw clonidine before initiating guanfacine or can you cross-taper?

Recommended clonidine therapeutic doses are in the order of 3–5 mcg/kg/day. It is uncommon to use doses beyond 300 mcg daily, due to the sedating and hypotensive effects of clonidine. However, some young people may be able to tolerate the cardiac effects of clonidine well and find that the sedation has additional benefits to sleep and comorbidities. Therefore, in these children, higher doses may be beneficial with regular monitoring of blood pressure and pulse. As clonidine can also be divided into two or three doses, quite often children who are sensitive to guanfacine side effects find that a BD or TDS regime of clonidine suits them better than the once daily dosing of guanfacine.

Clonidine is 10 times more potent than guanfacine at alpha-2 presynaptic receptors, whereas guanfacine appears to be more potent at post synaptic receptors, which translates into increased prefrontal activity and impulse control regulation and improvement in behaviour regulation. Therefore, in the case of comorbidities where behavioural modification is desired, guanfacine seems to have a better effect.

Guanfacine weight dosing guidelines indicate 0.05–0.08 mg/kg/day suggesting that a rough equivalency is: Guanfacine 1 mg = Clonidine 100 mcg.

If it is clinically acceptable from a tic perspective to reduce and withdrawal clonidine first, before initiating guanfacine, this is likely to be best practise, as the side effects will be additive. Reducing clonidine by 25 mg every 3–5 days is thought to be appropriate to facilitate this reduction.

However, it may not be beneficial from a tic/sleep/behaviour perspective to reduce and withdraw clonidine completely before starting guanfacine. In these circumstances, cross-tapering is recommended by reducing clonidine to 100 mcg daily before initiating guanfacine at 1mg daily. Following on from this, all remaining clonidine doses are reduced by 25 mcg every 3 days before guanfacine is increased as necessary.

### An overdose of extended-release guanfacine [^115NFaKd]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2013). Low credibility.

Extended-release guanfacine is a centrally acting α2-adrenergic agonist that was recently approved for treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. The following is a case discussion of a 12-year-old boy with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and Tourette syndrome, who presented 18 hours after ingestion of 3 times his usual dose of extended-release guanfacine. On presentation, he was lethargic, bradycardic, and hypertensive with an otherwise nonfocal neurological examination. He remained hypertensive until administration of an intravenous antihypertensive agent (nicardipine) 24 hours after ingestion. After cessation of the calcium-channel blocker, he continued to have intermittent episodes of symptomatic hypotension for the next 2½ days. This extremely protracted course of hypertension followed by prolonged symptomatic hypotension is rare with ingestions of centrally acting α2-adrenergic agonists. As this drug is increasingly prescribed for treatment of a disease with increasing prevalence, it is imperative that emergency physicians become familiar with the varying presentations of its toxicity.

### Gaunfacine (guanfacine) [^111csrez]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

General

Like other antihypertensive agents, guanfacine hydrochloride should be used with caution in patients with severe coronary insufficiency, recent myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular disease, or chronic renal or hepatic failure.

Sedation

Guanfacine hydrochloride, like other orally active central α2-adrenergic agonists, causes sedation or drowsiness, especially when beginning therapy. These symptoms are dose-related (see ADVERSE REACTIONS). When guanfacine hydrochloride is used with other centrally active depressants (such as phenothiazines, barbiturates, or benzodiazepines), the potential for additive sedative effects should be considered.

Rebound

Abrupt cessation of therapy with orally active central α2-adrenergic agonists may be associated with increases (from depressed on-therapy levels) in plasma and urinary catecholamines, symptoms of "nervousness and anxiety" and, less commonly, increases in blood pressure to levels significantly greater than those prior to therapy.

Information for Patients

Patients who receive guanfacine hydrochloride should be advised to exercise caution when operating dangerous machinery or driving motor vehicles until it is determined that they do not become drowsy or dizzy from the medication. Patients should be warned that their tolerance for alcohol and other CNS depressants may be diminished. Patients should be advised not to discontinue therapy abruptly.

Laboratory Tests

In clinical trials, no clinically relevant laboratory test abnormalities were identified as causally related to drug during short-term treatment with guanfacine hydrochloride.

### Guanfacine overdose resulting in initial hypertension and subsequent delayed, persistent orthostatic hypotension [^114Wx3Co]. Clinical Toxicology (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

Guanfacine is an alpha(2)-adrenoreceptor agonist used for the treatment of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and tic disorders. Few reports exist regarding overdose with guanfacine.

Case Report

A 16-year-old female with Tourette's syndrome presented with diaphoresis, dry mouth, and hypertension 8 h after ingesting 25 mg of guanfacine. These symptoms improved and her blood pressure (BP) normalized over 2 h. Thirty hours following ingestion, she experienced near syncope and returned to the emergency department. She was noted to have orthostatic hypotension and a prolonged QTc interval of 593 ms on electrocardiogram. With only fluid support, she was asymptomatic by 60 h postingestion and her QTc interval had improved to 511 ms.

Discussion

This experience suggests a much delayed onset of symptoms may occur and that the QTc interval may be prolonged, necessitating a longer period of monitoring in a patient presenting with an overdose.

### Enhanced pain relief with guanfacine as an adjuvant for trigeminal nerve blocks: insights from a pheWAS-guided randomized controlled study [^116WKmjn]. Pain Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

ADRA2 agonists have been previously shown to mitigate neuropathic pain. For example, dexmedetomidine enhances the local anesthetic action of lidocaine and is used in the postoperative period for analgesia and for neuropathic pain crisis. Currently, guanfacine has a limited role in the treatment of pain, and is used for the treatment of ADHD and hypertension. However, guanfacine may have a role in treating opioid-induced hyperalgesia. Furthermore, animal studies have demonstrated that guanfacine has a longer antinociceptive effect compared to clonidine, and is nontoxic when used for analgesia, including when used in the subarachnoid space. Of the Alpha-2 agonists, guanfacine is least likely to cause hypotension or rebound hypertension with discontinuation. This study supports further investigation of guanfacine's role in the treatment of facial pain in those with painful trigeminal neuropathy and trigeminal neuralgia when used with lidocaine in an image-guided peripheral nerve block.

Alpha 2A and 2B receptor subtypes are expressed in the spinal cord and are involved in pain modulation. The ADRA2B gene, encoding the Alpha 2B receptor, is expressed in humans on the trigeminal ganglion. In our study, we injected the maxillary and mandibular branches of the trigeminal nerve near the foramen where these branches come off of the ganglion, rather than the ganglion, for safety purposes. While we have no explicit evidence the Alpha 2A receptor is expressed in the trigeminal branches in humans, and further studies are needed to investigate if the observed effects in our study are due to mechanistic action at the axonal or ganglion level, it is possible Alpha 2A is expressed outside the ganglion as it is found on the trigeminal nerve root in zebrafishand at the afferent terminal of the trigeminal nerves in mice. Alpha-2 receptor activation leads to negative feedback and a decrease in norepinephrine release. Also, guanfacine inhibits neurotransmitter release from presynaptic nerve terminals through ADRA2 G proteins, inhibiting calcium-dependent neurotransmitter release. This mechanism may have accounted for the enhanced analgesia observed in our study. Furthermore, although the volume of injectate used in our block procedure is within the amount described in the literature, it was large enough to have migrated to the trigeminal ganglion through the foramen rotundum or foramen ovale and reached the ADRA and other receptors on the trigeminal ganglion.

### Randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study of single-dose guanfacine in unilateral neglect following stroke [^111JJ9K5]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

Touchscreen cancellation: directional bias

Independent repeated-measures ANOVAs revealed no main effect of drug on the difference between the cancellations on the right and left sides of the cancellation task (figure 2B), F(2, 24) = 0.39, P = 0.683, BF₁₀ = 0.231, and no main effect of drug on the centre of cancellation (figure 2C), F(2, 24) = 2.45, P = 0.108, BF₁₀ = 0.848. A direct comparison of the difference in right and left cancellations in the placebo (M = 12.0, SD = 7.99) and guanfacine (M = 11.92, SD = 11.36) conditions revealed no difference between the two, t(12) = 0.03, P = 0.976, BF₁₀ = 0.278.

In sum, these results provide inconclusive evidence for an effect of drug on the centre of cancellation, but they do provide moderate evidence against an effect of guanfacine on the right minus left directional bias.

Touchscreen cancellation: revisits and search organisation

We found no conclusive evidence for an effect of drug on revisits (online supplementary figure 1) and moderate evidence against there being a main effect of drug in all indices of search organisation (online supplementary figure 2). Exact test results and direct comparisons between guanfacine and placebo can be found in the supplementary materials.

Sustained attention

A repeated-measures ANOVA revealed no main effect of drug on reaction time variability (online supplementary figure 3E). F Greenhouse-Geisser (1.38, 16.61) = 0.96, P = 0.371, BF₁₀ = 0.100, nor a main effect of time, F(4, 48) = 0.20, P = 0.939, BF₁₀ = 0.022. There was also no interaction between drug and time, F(8, 96) = 0.72, P = 0.673. These results provide moderate to strong evidence that there was no effect of drug or time on reaction time variability in the sustained attention task.

Signal-detection variables were also computed and analysed and are reported in the supplementary materials.

### Common practical questions-and answers-at the British Association for Psychopharmacology child and adolescent psychopharmacology course [^113KfNvM]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Medium credibility.

Only after all these aspects have been assessed, the prescriber should consider: (1) second-line medications (atomoxetine – which selectively inhibits the norepinephrine transporter, and guanfacine – that selectively stimulates alpha-2 adrenergic receptors, or clonidine, that selectively stimulates alpha-2A adrenergic receptors); (2) augmenting agents (guanfacine or clonidine XR); (3) other agents, under specialistic advice/supervision, for which RCTs provide preliminary evidence of efficacy (e.g. bupropion, a non-competitive antagonist of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors).

Does the concomitant use of cannabis impact on the effectiveness and tolerability of psychostimulants?

The evidence on the effectiveness of psychostimulants in marijuana users and the tolerability of the combination psychostimulants–marijuana is limited. In a RCT of OROS-methylphenidate and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) in youths with substance use disorder (in the majority of the cases (66%), marijuana), there were no significant differences, in terms of efficacy, between participants assigned to OROS-methylphenidate plus CBT and those in the placebo plus CBT, when considering the primary outcome (scores on the ADHD-RS completed by the clinicians), even though ADHD-RS scores rated by parents were significantly lower in adolescents treated with OROS-MPH + CBT compared to those in the placebo + CBT arm at 8 and 16 weeks. The tolerability of OROS-methylphenidate was not substantially different compared to what it would be expected with OROS-methylphenidate alone. Another RCT showed addictive effects of MPH and tetrahydrocannabinol on heart rate, but not on systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Therefore, even though there is no solid evidence, psychostimulants may be overall well tolerated, but their effectiveness may be decreased by the concomitant use of marijuana. This should be discussed with the patient at the initial assessment and during the follow-up visits. If a psychostimulant is prescribed, it is crucial to monitor its possible misuse carefully. The chances of misuse can be decreased by using long-acting as opposed to immediate-release formulations.

It should be noted that a subgroup of youths who use marijuana also tend to misuse other illicit substances, which may further impact on the tolerability of psychostimulants. Therefore, prescribers should comprehensively screen for the use of a variety of illicit drugs.

### Epidemiology and toxicity of pediatric guanfacine exposures [^116GkuRC]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine the epidemiology and toxicity of guanfacine exposures in children and adolescents reported to poison control centers.

Methods

Guanfacine exposures reported to the American Association of Poison Control Centers Toxic Exposure Surveillance System from 1993 to 1999 in children and adolescents < 19 years of age were analyzed.

Results

There were 870 cases that met the inclusion criteria: 478 (54.9%) were children < 6 years old, 304 (34.9%) were 6–12 years old, and 88 (10.1%) were adolescents 13–18 years old. The number of cases increased eight-fold over the 7-year period, with the largest increase in children < 13 years of age. Analysis showed 29.7% of exposures were managed on site (non-healthcare facility) and 68.3% were managed in a healthcare facility. There were no symptoms in 546 (62.8%) children. In 324 symptomatic children, the most common symptoms were drowsiness/lethargy (76.8%), bradycardia (30.0%), and hypotension (25.8%). The majority of cases were acute (77.5%), 182 (20.9%) were acute-on-chronic, and 14 (1.6%) were chronic. Children aged 6–12 years represented the majority of the acute-on-chronic and chronic exposures with (n = 118). Overall, there were 195 (22.4%) exposures coded as minor, 121 (13.9%) as moderate, and 8 (0.9%) as major effects.

Conclusions

These data demonstrated a trend of increasing numbers of guanfacine exposures annually. Although the majority of children experienced minimal or no toxicity, serious toxicity can occur.

### Alpha2-adrenergic agonists for the management of opioid withdrawal [^114vX3iC]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Withdrawal is a necessary step prior to drug-free treatment or as the endpoint of long-term substitution treatment.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of interventions involving the use of alpha2-adrenergic agonists compared with placebo, reducing doses of methadone, symptomatic medications or with comparison of different alpha2-adrenergic agonists, for the management of the acute phase of opioid withdrawal. Outcomes included the intensity of signs and symptoms and overall withdrawal syndrome experienced, duration of treatment, occurrence of adverse effects and completion of treatment.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Issue 7, 2013), MEDLINE (1946 to July week 4, 2013), EMBASE (January 1985 to August week 1, 2013), PsycINFO (1806 to July week 5, 2013) and reference lists of articles. We also contacted manufacturers in the field.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing alpha2-adrenergic agonists (clonidine, lofexidine, guanfacine, tizanidine) with reducing doses of methadone, symptomatic medications or placebo, or comparing different alpha2-adrenergic agonists to modify the signs and symptoms of withdrawal in participants who were opioid dependent.

Data Collection and Analysis

One review author assessed studies for inclusion and undertook data extraction. All review authors decided on inclusion and confirmed the overall process.

Main Results

We included 25 randomised controlled trials, involving 1668 participants. Five studies compared a treatment regimen based on an alpha2-adrenergic agonist with placebo, 12 with a regimen based on reducing doses of methadone, four with symptomatic medications and five compared different alpha2-adrenergic agonists. Alpha2-adrenergic agonists were more effective than placebo in ameliorating withdrawal in terms of the likelihood of severe withdrawal (risk ratio (RR) 0.32, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.18 to 0.57, 3 studies, 148 participants). Completion of treatment was significantly more likely with alpha2-adrenergic agonists compared with placebo (RR 1.95, 95% CI 1.34 to 2.84, 3 studies, 148 participants). Alpha2-adrenergic agonists were somewhat less effective than reducing doses of methadone in ameliorating withdrawal symptoms, as measured by the likelihood of severe withdrawal (RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.73, 5 studies, 340 participants), peak withdrawal score (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.22, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.46, 2 studies, 263 participants) and overall withdrawal severity (SMD 0.13, 95% CI -0.24 to 0.49, 3 studies, 119 participants). These differences were not statistically significant. The signs and symptoms of withdrawal occurred and resolved earlier with alpha2-adrenergic agonists. The duration of treatment was significantly longer with reducing doses of methadone (SMD -1.07, 95% CI -1.31 to -0.83, 3 studies, 310 participants). Hypotensive or other adverse effects were significantly more likely with alpha2-adrenergic agonists (RR 1.92, 95% CI 1.19 to 3.10, 6 studies, 464 participants) but there was no significant difference in rates of completion of withdrawal treatment (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.05, 9 studies, 659 participants). There were insufficient data for quantitative comparison of different alpha2-adrenergic agonists. Available data suggest that lofexidine does not reduce blood pressure to the same extent as clonidine, but is otherwise similar to clonidine.

Authors' Conclusions

Clonidine and lofexidine are more effective than placebo for the management of withdrawal from heroin or methadone. No significant difference in efficacy was detected for treatment regimens based on clonidine or lofexidine, and those based on reducing doses of methadone over a period of around 10 days but methadone is associated with fewer adverse effects than clonidine, and lofexidine has a better safety profile than clonidine.

### Alpha2 adrenergic agonists for the management of opioid withdrawal [^112YKvFY]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Withdrawal (detoxification) is necessary prior to drug-free treatment. It may also represent the end point of long-term treatment such as methadone maintenance. The availability of managed withdrawal is essential to an effective treatment system.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of interventions involving the use of alpha2 adrenergic agonists (clonidine, lofexidine, guanfacine) to manage opioid withdrawal in terms of withdrawal signs and symptoms, completion of withdrawal and adverse effects.

Search Strategy

Multiple electronic databases (including MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Australian Medical Index, Cochrane Clinical Trials Register) were systematically searched. Reference lists of retrieved studies, reviews and conference abstracts were handsearched and relevant pharmaceutical companies contacted.

Selection Criteria

Controlled trials comparing alpha2 adrenergic agonists with reducing doses of methadone, symptomatic medications or placebo, or comparing different alpha2 adrenergic agonists to modify the signs and symptoms of withdrawal in participants who were primarily opioid dependent.

Data Collection and Analysis

One reviewer assessed studies for inclusion and undertook data extraction. Inclusion decisions and the overall process were confirmed by consultation between all four reviewers.

Main Results

Twenty-two studies, involving 1709 participants, were included. Eighteen were randomised controlled trials; for the remaining studies allocation was by participant choice in two, one used alternate allocation and in one the method of allocation was unclear. Twelve studies compared a treatment regime based on an alpha2 adrenergic agonist with one based on reducing doses of methadone. Diversity in study design, assessment and reporting of outcomes limited the extent of quantitative analysis. For the comparison of alpha2 adrenergic agonist regimes with reducing doses of methadone, there were insufficient data for statistical analysis, but withdrawal intensity appears similar to, or marginally greater with alpha2 adrenergic agonists, while signs and symptoms of withdrawal occur and resolve earlier in treatment. Participants stay in treatment longer with methadone. No significant difference was detected in rates of completion of withdrawal with adrenergic agonists compared to reducing doses of methadone, or clonidine compared to lofexidine. Clonidine is associated with more adverse effects (low blood pressure, dizziness, dry mouth, lack of energy) than reducing doses of methadone. Lofexidine does not reduce blood pressure to the same extent as clonidine, but is otherwise similar to clonidine.

Reviewers' Conclusions

No significant difference in efficacy was detected for treatment regimes based on the alpha2 adrenergic agonists clonidine and lofexidine, and those based on reducing doses of methadone over a period of around 10 days, for the management of withdrawal from heroin or methadone. Participants stay in treatment longer with methadone regimes and experience less adverse effects. The lower incidence of hypotension makes lofexidine more suited to use in outpatient settings than clonidine. There are insufficient data available to support a conclusion on the efficacy of other alpha2 adrenergic agonists.

### Alpha ₂-adrenergic agonists for the management of opioid withdrawal [^1138Czbm]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Withdrawal is a necessary step prior to drug-free treatment or as the endpoint of long-term substitution treatment.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of interventions involving the use of alpha2-adrenergic agonists compared with placebo, reducing doses of methadone, symptomatic medications, or an alpha2-adrenergic agonist regimen different to the experimental intervention, for the management of the acute phase of opioid withdrawal. Outcomes included the withdrawal syndrome experienced, duration of treatment, occurrence of adverse effects, and completion of treatment.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (1946 to November week 2, 2015), EMBASE (January 1985 to November week 2, 2015), PsycINFO (1806 to November week 2, 2015), Web of Science, and reference lists of articles.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing alpha2-adrenergic agonists (clonidine, lofexidine, guanfacine, tizanidine) with reducing doses of methadone, symptomatic medications or placebo, or comparing different alpha2-adrenergic agonists to modify the signs and symptoms of withdrawal in participants who were opioid dependent.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration.

Main Results

We included 26 randomised controlled trials involving 1728 participants. Six studies compared an alpha2-adrenergic agonist with placebo, 12 with reducing doses of methadone, four with symptomatic medications, and five compared different alpha2-adrenergic agonists. We assessed 10 studies as having a high risk of bias in at least one of the methodological domains that were considered. We found moderate-quality evidence that alpha2-adrenergic agonists were more effective than placebo in ameliorating withdrawal in terms of the likelihood of severe withdrawal (risk ratio (RR) 0.32, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.18 to 0.57; 3 studies; 148 participants). We found moderate-quality evidence that completion of treatment was significantly more likely with alpha2-adrenergic agonists compared with placebo (RR 1.95, 95% CI 1.34 to 2.84; 3 studies; 148 participants). Peak withdrawal severity may be greater with alpha2-adrenergic agonists than with reducing doses of methadone, as measured by the likelihood of severe withdrawal (RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.73; 5 studies; 340 participants; low quality), and peak withdrawal score (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.22, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.46; 2 studies; 263 participants; moderate quality), but these differences were not significant and there is no significant difference in severity when considered over the entire duration of the withdrawal episode (SMD 0.13, 95% CI -0.24 to 0.49; 3 studies; 119 participants; moderate quality). The signs and symptoms of withdrawal occurred and resolved earlier with alpha2-adrenergic agonists. The duration of treatment was significantly longer with reducing doses of methadone (SMD -1.07, 95% CI -1.31 to -0.83; 3 studies; 310 participants; low quality). Hypotensive or other adverse effects were significantly more likely with alpha2-adrenergic agonists (RR 1.92, 95% CI 1.19 to 3.10; 6 studies; 464 participants; low quality), but there was no significant difference in rates of completion of withdrawal treatment (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.05; 9 studies; 659 participants; low quality). There were insufficient data for quantitative comparison of different alpha2-adrenergic agonists. Available data suggest that lofexidine does not reduce blood pressure to the same extent as clonidine, but is otherwise similar to clonidine.

Authors' Conclusions

Clonidine and lofexidine are more effective than placebo for the management of withdrawal from heroin or methadone. We detected no significant difference in efficacy between treatment regimens based on clonidine or lofexidine and those based on reducing doses of methadone over a period of around 10 days, but methadone was associated with fewer adverse effects than clonidine, and lofexidine has a better safety profile than clonidine.

### Guanfacine toxic ingestion with subsequent cardiogenic pulmonary edema [^116aiznU]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Guanfacine is a central alpha-2 agonist often prescribed for Attention-deficit hyperactive disorder as well as tic disorder, with a usual dose of 1–4 mg per day. Due to its sympatholytic mechanism of action, Guanfacine can cause autonomic instability and hypotension. It can additionally cause cardiac dysfunction to include symptomatic bradycardias and contractility suppression. The authors present a case of a 17 year-old male with an ingestion of 80 mg of extended release Guanfacine with delayed onset cardiogenic pulmonary edema requiring mechanical ventilation. Previous pediatric ingestions have generated bradycardia, hypotension, and decreased level of consciousness, responsive to intravenous fluids, vasopressors, and occasionally naloxone. However, cardiogenic pulmonary edema from reduced cardiac contractility is a novel consequence of extended release Guanfacine ingestion. With Guanfacine's extended half-life, this unique case underscores the importance of emergency providers' familiarity with this toxidrome as well the necessity for prolonged, close observation following Guanfacine ingestion.

### Amphetamine, past and present – a pharmacological and clinical perspective [^114TZsLt]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2013). Low credibility.

Once-daily formulations

In previous reviews, we have extensively described the efficacy and safety of stimulant and non-stimulant drugs used in the management of ADHD and compared the relative merits of each. This analysis has revealed that the stimulants, including amphetamine, are still accepted to be the most efficacious drugs available. Some attempts to introduce new medications, for example guanfacine XR (Intuniv®) have been successful, but many other new pharmacological approaches have failed (see). On the other hand, the innovations in formulation technology and drug delivery systems have made significant strides forward in improving the clinical management of ADHD. All of the stimulants have biological half-lives that require at least twice-daily dosing to deliver efficacy over 12–14 h. ADHD is characterised by inattention, distractibility, working memory deficits and impulsivity, and as such, subjects with this disorder are particularly unsuited to compliance with rigid dosing schedules. Since amphetamine has a high liability for recreational abuse, placing medicines in the hands of children increases the risk of diversion/abuse, whilst the alternative approach of putting the drugs into the care of the school authorities carries with it the requirement for appropriate facilities for the storage of Controlled Drugs. Administering a once-daily stimulant medication to a child or adolescent first thing in the morning under parental supervision relieves him/her of the requirement to take additional medication outside of the home, and it also eliminates the need for the patient to take additional medication within strict time-windows. One of the additional benefits of these new formulations is their tamper deterrence, making it difficult for abusers to extract amphetamine for self-administration by hazardous routes, such as smoking, 'snorting' or intravenous injection. Examples of once-daily amphetamine medications include MES-amphetamine XR and the d- amphetamine prodrug, lisdexamfetamine.

### The ASAM national practice guideline for the treatment of opioid use disorder: 2020 focused update [^116Cb1Fv]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Alpha-2 adrenergic agonists for opioid withdrawal — clonidine dosing and comparative considerations are detailed as follows: Clonidine is generally used at doses of 0.1–0.3 mg every 6–8 hours, with a maximum dose of 1.2 mg daily, and is often combined with non-narcotic symptomatic medications. Alpha-2 adrenergic agonists are more effective than placebo in reducing severe withdrawal and in improving rates of treatment retention and completion. Comparative data indicate lofexidine and clonidine appear similarly effective, with hypotension occurring less frequently with lofexidine; therefore, lofexidine should be the preferred choice for outpatient withdrawal management where monitoring and management of hypotension are more difficult. Other agents such as guanfacine (available in the U.S.) can also be used off-label as an alternative to clonidine.

### Neural mechanisms underlying the therapeutic actions of guanfacine treatment in youth with ADHD: a pilot fMRI study [^114LxP6q]. Psychiatry Research (2015). Low credibility.

Twenty-five youth with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) were scanned with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while performing a Go/No-go task before and after 6–8 weeks of randomized once-daily treatment with either the α₂A-adrenergic receptor agonist guanfacine or placebo. Clinical improvement was greater for guanfacine than placebo and was differentially associated with reduced activation for guanfacine compared with placebo in the right midcingulate cortex/supplementary motor area and the left posterior cingulate cortex.

### Guanfacine effects on stress, drug craving and prefrontal activation in cocaine dependent individuals: preliminary findings [^1165ujV7]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2012). Low credibility.

Cocaine dependence is associated with increased stress and drug cue-induced craving and physiological arousal but decreased prefrontal activity to emotional and cognitive challenge. As these changes are associated with relapse risk, we investigated the effects of α2 receptor agonist guanfacine on these processes. Twenty-nine early abstinent treatment-seeking cocaine dependent individuals were randomly assigned to either daily placebo or guanfacine (up to 3 mg) for four weeks. In a laboratory experiment, all patients were exposed to three 10-min guided imagery conditions (stress/stress, drug cue/drug cue, stress/drug cue), one per day, consecutively in a random, counterbalanced order. Subjective craving, anxiety and arousal as well as cardiovascular output were assessed repeatedly. Brain response to stress, drug cue and relaxing imagery was also assessed during a functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) imaging session. In the current study, guanfacine was found to be safe and well-tolerated. Lower basal heart rate and blood pressure was observed in the guanfacine versus placebo group. Guanfacine lowered stress and cue-induced nicotine craving and cue-induced cocaine craving, anxiety and arousal. The guanfacine group also showed increased medial and lateral prefrontal activity following stress and drug cue exposure compared with placebo. Data suggest further exploration of guanfacine is warranted in terms of its potential for reducing stress-induced and cue-induced drug craving and arousal.

### Scientific rationale for the use of α ₂ A-adrenoceptor agonists in treating neuroinflammatory cognitive disorders [^111vhjYQ]. Molecular Psychiatry (2023). Medium credibility.

Guanfacine has beneficial actions in patients

Guanfacine, clonidine and dexmedetomidine are all in widespread clinical use, with the α2A-AR agonist guanfacine being used more prominently for nonsurgical/daytime use due to its less sedating properties. The FDA approved extended release guanfacine (Intuniv™) in 2009 for treating ADHD in children and adolescents, and its approval has been extended to adults with ADHD in Japan. However, guanfacine is also used extensively off-label in a number of conditions that involve PFC dysfunction, including PTSD, conduct disorder, and autism spectrum disorders. Guanfacine also reduces self-injurious behavior, agitation/aggression and attention/impulse control in patients with Prader-Willi Syndrome, similar to its effects in monkeys.

In addition to these conditions, guanfacine has been in experimental use, and/or being formally tested, for treating the cognitive disorders discussed in this review. Guanfacine is being used off-label to treat cognitive deficits following TBI, including evidence of enhanced PFC activity and improved working memory with guanfacine treatment. Guanfacine has also been shown to improve attention in patients with contralateral neglect from strokes in the right parietal association cortex, and to improve attentional regulation in a patient following encephalomyelitis. Guanfacine, in combination with N-acetylcysteine, is also being used off label to treat cognitive deficits associated with "long-COVID". It is noteworthy that both COVID-19 infection and TBI increase risk of Alzheimer's neuropathology, and guanfacine is currently being tested as a potential add-on treatment for early AD.

As described above, dexmedetomidine is already in extensive use in the ICU in ventilated patients and in surgery as an anesthetic, and can help diminish delirium in vulnerable subjects, including recent data using α2-AR agonists to treat delirium associated with acute COVID-19 infection. However, dexmedetomidine has potent sedating effects that are problematic when the patients need to proceed to a coherent, waking state. Open label data suggest that guanfacine may be particularly useful in this regard, especially in agitated, hyperactive delirium, where guanfacine's calming effects may involve many of the mechanisms described above. Intravenous and oral formulations of guanfacine are currently being tested for their effects on delirium from critical illness in large clinical trials (NCT04742673, NCT04578886).

### Clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents [^1134mQyJ]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Special Circumstances: Adolescents (age 12 years to the 18th birthday) — substance use, diversion, and driving: Before beginning medication treatment of adolescents with newly diagnosed ADHD, clinicians should assess the patient for symptoms of substance use, and if active substance use is identified, the clinician should refer the patient to a subspecialist for consultative support and guidance. Diversion of ADHD medication is a special concern among adolescents; clinicians should monitor the adolescent's symptoms and prescription refill requests for signs of misuse or diversion, including by parents, classmates, or their acquaintances, and the majority of states now require prescriber participation in prescription drug monitoring programs. To minimize abuse potential, clinicians may consider prescribing nonstimulant medications such as atomoxetine and extended-release guanfacine or extended-release clonidine. Given the risks of driving for adolescents with ADHD, special consideration should be taken to provide medication coverage for symptom control while driving, and longer-acting or late-afternoon, short-acting medications may be helpful in this regard.
