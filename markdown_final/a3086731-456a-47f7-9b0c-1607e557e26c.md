## Question

When should prostate cancer screening be performed?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking when prostate cancer screening should be performed — specifically when to start PSA testing, how often to screen, and when to stop — while considering high-risk groups, shared decision-making, and differences among guidelines. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the primary screening modality and the overarching principle of shared decision-making. Then, I should stratify by age and life expectancy. Next, I will identify high-risk populations and the timing of earlier screening. After that, I need to delineate interval strategies based on baseline risk, clarify when to stop screening, and specify how to manage abnormal screening results. Finally, I should integrate this into a practical algorithm and reconcile guideline variations to synthesize a balanced, clinically actionable approach [^117HXCk7] [^1117UMji] [^111tWCUc] [^112V81V9].

> Let me first confirm the screening modality and core principle. PSA is the first-line screening test for early detection; DRE can be considered as an adjunct to refine risk but is not mandatory — wait, I should verify this nuance so I don't overstate the role of DRE; yes, DRE is optional and used to contextualize PSA-based risk, not to replace it [^117HXCk7] [^111Qs6wD]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about population-wide screening; all major contemporary guidelines emphasize shared decision-making given the narrow absolute mortality benefit and meaningful harms, and none endorse universal, population-based screening without individualized counseling [^1117UMji] [^111tWCUc] [^113UNGM1] [^111rsE6o].

> I should anchor the benefit–harm framework clearly. Adequate evidence indicates that in men aged 55–69, PSA-based screening may prevent about 1.3 prostate cancer deaths per 1000 screened over roughly 13 years and about 3 cases of metastatic disease per 1000, but false positives, overdiagnosis, and treatment-related complications such as incontinence and erectile dysfunction are common; I need to ensure these absolute numbers are correct — yes, that's the USPSTF estimate [^112V81V9] [^111rsE6o].

> Next, I will stratify by age and life expectancy because benefit requires sufficient time horizon. Routine screening before age 40 is not supported, and the principal target group is 55–69 years where shared decision-making is essential; for many ≥ 70, routine screening is discouraged because life expectancy often falls below the threshold where benefits accrue — let me verify the cutoffs and framing; AUA/SUO supports individualized screening primarily between 50–69 with 2–4 year intervals, and USPSTF recommends against routine screening at ≥ 70, while EAU emphasizes offering early detection only to well-informed men with at least a 15-year life expectancy [^1113ymgE] [^1117UMji] [^113SgBTe] [^111tWCUc] [^115AjTto].

> I should now identify who is "high-risk" and when to start earlier. Earlier screening should be considered at age 40–45 in BRCA2 carriers and possibly BRCA1, in men with strong family history — especially if relatives were diagnosed < 65 or if multiple first-degree relatives are affected — and in men of Black/African ancestry; wait, let me double-check that EAU and AUA align on specific ages, and ESMO also supports earlier consideration in these groups — yes, AUA and EAU converge on 40 for BRCA2 and 45 for family history or African ancestry, and ESMO suggests earlier PSA for BRCA1/2 and high-risk ancestries [^114i8Ms4] [^116YZumg] [^111Hd5nN] [^112V81V9].

> Now, I need to detail what "shared decision-making" entails for men 55–69. First, I should confirm age 55–69 and life expectancy ≥ 10 years, then discuss the modest absolute mortality benefit versus the risks of false positives, biopsies, overdiagnosis, and downstream treatment morbidity; I should confirm that guidelines explicitly require counseling before PSA testing — yes, AUA/SUO emphasizes shared decision-making, EAU recommends counseling on benefits and harms before testing, and USPSTF frames this as an individualized decision for 55–69 [^1117UMji] [^116rV2ru] [^111rsE6o].

> Next, I will examine screening intervals and risk-adapted strategies. Standard intervals of every 2–4 years are reasonable for average risk in midlife, with more frequent (about 2-year) intervals for higher risk; a risk-adapted approach based on baseline PSA allows longer intervals for very low PSA and earlier follow-up for higher deciles — let me verify specifics: EAU supports follow-up every 2 years for higher risk and postponing up to 8 years for low-risk baselines, and AUA suggests 2–4 year intervals with personalization or discontinuation based on age, PSA, risk, and preferences; evidence also supports that PSA < 1 ng/mL at age 60 predicts extremely low long-term prostate cancer mortality, informing extended intervals or cessation in selected men [^113vp2r3] [^1113ymgE] [^117SkRr6] [^111DZPBh].

> Hold on, I should verify when to stop screening and ensure I specify both absolute and relative stopping criteria. Routine screening should generally stop at age ≥ 70 or when life expectancy is < 10–15 years, and it should stop earlier if patient preferences shift or if baseline risk remains very low over time; for example, persistently low PSA values and multiple negative screens reduce the likelihood of benefit — let me ensure alignment with guidelines: USPSTF recommends against PSA screening ≥ 70, EAU advises discontinuing early detection when life expectancy < 15 years, and risk-adapted strategies allow cessation when PSA is low at 60 in the appropriate context [^113SgBTe] [^115AjTto] [^113vp2r3] [^111DZPBh].

> I will now examine how to manage abnormal screening results and avoid unnecessary biopsies. Do not biopsy on a single elevated PSA alone; repeat the PSA to confirm, contextualize with DRE and a validated risk calculator, consider secondary biomarkers to refine risk, and obtain pre-biopsy MRI to improve detection of clinically significant disease while reducing unnecessary biopsies — wait, I should double-check the "repeat PSA" thresholds and the role of MRI; EAU explicitly recommends repeating PSA in the 3–10 ng/mL range with normal DRE before further steps, AUA advises repeating newly elevated PSA and using validated risk calculators, discouraging PSA velocity alone, and multiple guidelines endorse selective use of biomarkers and MRI before biopsy as part of modern risk assessment, while MRI is not an initial screening tool [^1167Ti8A] [^115Gjfpu] [^114CjTvN] [^115tzmnU] [^1166p5fS] [^111GkQms] [^112c5bk8] [^115LMqXD] [^111tWCUc].

> But wait, what if the biopsy is negative — should screening stop automatically? No, I need to confirm follow-up guidance; AUA recommends not discontinuing solely because of a negative biopsy and instead re-evaluating within the normal interval or sooner based on risk and life expectancy, which maintains vigilance without overtesting [^115Uj9Eq] [^112pQTTb].

> Let me integrate this into a practical, stepwise clinical flow while keeping the nuances in mind. For men 40–70, assess risk status and life expectancy first; for high-risk men, consider starting at 40–45; for 55–69 with ≥ 10-year life expectancy, engage in shared decision-making and, if chosen, obtain PSA and consider DRE; tailor intervals to baseline PSA and overall risk, repeating PSA to confirm abnormalities and using calculators, biomarkers, and MRI selectively to guide biopsy; discontinue when age or life expectancy thresholds are reached or when sustained low-risk profiles make further screening unlikely to help, ensuring that patient values are centered throughout [^1117UMji] [^111tWCUc] [^111rsE6o].

> I should double-check guideline variations and make sure I state them accurately without overgeneralizing. AUA/SUO supports shared decision-making for 55–69 with risk-adapted intervals and earlier initiation in high-risk groups; EAU emphasizes individualized, risk-adapted early detection for men with ≥ 15-year life expectancy and mandates counseling before testing; ESMO cautions against population-wide screening due to overdiagnosis; USPSTF advises individualized decisions for 55–69 and recommends against routine screening ≥ 70 — these positions differ in tone but converge on informed, risk-adapted, patient-centered screening rather than blanket policies [^1117UMji] [^111tWCUc] [^113UNGM1] [^111rsE6o] [^113SgBTe].

> Final synthesis, and let me reconsider to ensure consistency: PSA-based screening should be selectively offered, primarily to well-informed men aged 55–69 with ≥ 10-year life expectancy after shared decision-making, with earlier initiation for high-risk men and risk-adapted intervals anchored to baseline PSA; discontinue when age ≥ 70, life expectancy < 10–15 years, or persistently low-risk profiles make benefit unlikely, and always confirm abnormal PSA before escalation, using calculators, biomarkers, and MRI to target biopsies toward clinically significant disease while minimizing harms [^112V81V9] [^1117UMji] [^111tWCUc] [^113SgBTe] [^113vp2r3] [^114CjTvN].

Screen for prostate cancer in **men aged 50–69 years** [^1113ymgE] after shared decision-making about benefits and harms [^1117UMji] [^111rsE6o]. For higher-risk men (Black ancestry, strong family history, or BRCA1/2 mutations) [^114i8Ms4], **start at 40–45 years** [^111Hd5nN] [^116YZumg]. Do not screen men with **life expectancy < 10–15 years** [^112hqno3] or those ≥ 70 years [^113SgBTe] unless they are healthy with ≥ 15 years expected survival [^111tWCUc]. Use PSA as the primary test [^117HXCk7], consider DRE [^111Qs6wD], and repeat PSA before further tests if PSA is 3–10 ng/mL with a normal DRE [^115Gjfpu] [^114CjTvN] [^1167Ti8A]. Individualize re-screening intervals (2–4 years) [^112pQTTb] based on risk, age, and preferences [^117SkRr6].

---

## General population screening recommendations

- **Age 50–69 years**: Regular screening every 2–4 years [^1117UMji] is recommended, with shared decision-making to weigh benefits and harms [^1113ymgE] [^111rsE6o].

- **Age < 50 years**: Consider a baseline PSA at 45–50 years [^114guQhz], especially if risk factors are present [^113vp2r3].

- **Age ≥ 70 years**: Do not screen routinely [^113SgBTe]; consider only if healthy with ≥ 15-year life expectancy [^111tWCUc].

---

## High-risk populations

Start earlier and consider more frequent screening for **high-risk groups** [^116YZumg]:

| **Risk factor** | **Recommended screening age** |
|-|-|
| Black ancestry | 40–45 years [^114i8Ms4] [^116YZumg] |
| Strong family history | 40–45 years [^114i8Ms4] [^116YZumg] |
| BRCA1/2 mutations | 40–45 years [^114i8Ms4] [^111Hd5nN] [^116YZumg] |

---

## Screening methods

Use **PSA testing** as the primary screening test [^117HXCk7]; if PSA is 3–10 ng/mL with a normal DRE, repeat the PSA before further evaluation [^115Gjfpu] [^1167Ti8A]. **DRE** may be considered alongside PSA to assess the risk of clinically significant cancer [^111Qs6wD].

---

## Individualized screening intervals

Re-screening intervals should be **personalized** [^117SkRr6] based on risk, age, PSA levels, and patient preferences, with typical intervals of 2–4 years [^112pQTTb].

---

## When to discontinue screening

Discontinue screening when **life expectancy < 10–15 years** [^112hqno3], as benefits are unlikely [^115AjTto]. For **age ≥ 70 years** [^113SgBTe], generally stop screening unless the patient is healthy with a ≥ 15-year life expectancy [^111tWCUc].

---

Screening for prostate cancer should be **individualized** based on age, risk factors, and patient preferences [^111rsE6o], with shared decision-making [^116rV2ru] to balance benefits and harms.

### Viewpoint: Expanding prostate cancer screening [^115HeSfD]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Prostate cancer screening is controversial, as major professional associations offer differing screening guidelines. The authors address three key issues surrounding prostate cancer screening:

1. **Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) criteria**: Evaluating the PSA criteria to recommend a prostate biopsy.
2. **Appropriate age to start screening**: Determining the age to begin screening.
3. **Appropriate age to stop screening**: Establishing when to cease screening activities.

On the basis of evidence published since 2000, the authors argue that data supporting the efficacy of PSA screening are convincing. They recommend screening for risk assessment for average-risk men beginning at age 40 years, screening selected healthy men older than age 70 years, and lowering the PSA threshold for considering a biopsy to 2.5 ng/mL for all men.

### Early detection of prostate cancer: AUA/SUO guideline part I: Prostate cancer screening [^117SkRr6]. The Journal of Urology (2023). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for prostate cancer, specifically concerning indications for screening and repeat screening, the AUA/SUO 2023 guidelines recommend considering personalizing the re-screening interval or discontinuing screening. This decision should be based on patient preference, age, PSA levels, prostate cancer risk, life expectancy, and general health, following shared decision-making.

### Screening for prostate cancer: evidence, ongoing trials, policies and knowledge gaps [^117HbLwh]. BMJ Oncology (2023). Low credibility.

- **United States Preventive Services Task Force recommendation**: The United States Preventive Services Task Force in 2012 recommended against PSA testing of asymptomatic men, regardless of age. In 2018, the recommendation was changed to: "For men aged 55 to 69 years, the decision to undergo periodic PSA-based screening for prostate cancer should be an individual one and should include discussion of the potential benefits and harms of screening with their clinician".

- **European Union recommendation**: The 2003 European Union (EU) Council Recommendation for Cancer Screening did not include prostate cancer. Based on an evidence review concluding that screening with PSA testing and bi-parametric MRI for PSA-positive men reduces overdiagnosis and is likely to be cost-effective for many EU member states, and the significant amount of ongoing opportunistic screening, the EU Council in December 2022 recommended that "countries should consider a stepwise approach, including piloting and further research, to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of the implementation of organised programmes aimed at ensuring appropriate management and quality on the basis of PSA testing for men in combination with additional MRI scanning".

- **Lithuania: opportunistic PSA screening in primary care**: The Lithuanian Early Prostate Cancer Detection Programme started in 2006. A PSA test is offered to all men aged 50–74 years who visit a general practitioner. Men with PSA ≥ 3 ng/mL are referred to a urologist. During the first 10 years of the programme, 70% of the target population had at least one PSA test.

### What's new in screening in 2015 [^1163djmB]. Current Opinion in Urology (2016). Low credibility.

The aim of this review was to highlight important articles in the field of prostate cancer screening published during 2015 and early 2016. Four major areas were identified: screening strategies, post-United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) 2011–2012, screening trends/patterns, and shared decision making.

Several studies furthered the evidence that screening reduces the risk of metastasis and death from prostate cancer. Multiplex screening strategies are of proven benefit; genetics and MRI need further evaluation. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening rates declined in men above the age of 50 years, as did the overall prostate cancer incidence following the USPSTF 2011–2012 recommendation against PSA. The consequences of declining screening rates will become apparent in the next few years. More research is needed to identify the most optimal approach to engage in, and implement, effective shared decision-making in clinical practice.

Data emerging in 2015 provided evidence on the question of how best to screen and brought more steps in the right direction of 'next-generation prostate cancer screening'. Screening is an ongoing process in all men, regardless of whether they might benefit from early detection and treatment. After the USPSTF 2011–2012 recommendation, the rates of PSA testing are declining; however, this decline is observed in all men and not solely in those who will not benefit from the screening. The long-term effect of this recommendation might not be as anticipated.

### Prostate cancer: To screen, or not to screen, is that the question [^112xK4Q9]. BMC Urology (2008). Low credibility.

After the introduction of serum PSA over 20 years ago as a tumor marker for prostate cancer, controversy regarding PSA and prostate cancer screening still abounds.

- **Screening considerations**: First, who should be screened? Second, does screening affect mortality? Third, the serum PSA used for screening has a low specificity (~30%), resulting in a vast number of patients undergoing costly and invasive procedures to diagnose prostate cancer. Fourth, does screening lead to overdiagnosis and overtreatment? These are just a few of the controversial issues surrounding PSA and prostate cancer screening.

It is clear that over the past decade, the utility of serum PSA in diagnosing prostate cancer has declined. Though still an important screening tool for prostate cancer, we have noticed a 'PSA migration' — i.e. heavily screened populations are presenting with lower serum PSA levels today compared to 10–20 years ago. Although serum PSA may not be the ideal screening tool, it is the centerpiece of two large prospective randomized clinical trials: the Prostate, Lung, Colon, and Ovary (PLCO) screening trial in the US and the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC) in Europe, assessing the benefits of prostate cancer screening.

- **Lack of level I evidence**: Though we are lacking level I evidence demonstrating the benefit of screening, we are engulfed in a sea of circumstantial evidence associated with prostate cancer screening.

	- **European studies**: In two large European studies, prostate cancer survival improved in men who underwent prostate cancer screening and treatment compared to those who did not undergo screening and/or treatment.

### Prostate specific antigen best practice statement: 2009 update [^114MFpqg]. The Journal of Urology (2013). Low credibility.

We provide information on the use of PSA testing for the evaluation of men at risk for prostate cancer and the risks and benefits of early detection. The report is a summary of the American Urological Association PSA Best Practice Policy 2009. This summary statement is based on a review of the professional literature, clinical experience, and the expert opinions of a multispecialty panel. It is intended to serve as a resource for physicians, other health care professionals, and patients. It does not establish a fixed set of guidelines, define the legal standard of care, or pre-empt physician judgment in individual cases.

There are two notable differences in the policy. First, the age for obtaining a baseline PSA has been lowered to 40 years. Secondly, the policy no longer recommends a single, threshold value of PSA, which should prompt prostate biopsy. Instead, the decision to proceed to prostate biopsy should be based primarily on PSA and DRE results, while taking into account multiple factors including free and total PSA, patient age, PSA velocity, PSA density, family history, ethnicity, prior biopsy history, and comorbidities.

Although recently published trials show different results regarding the impact of prostate cancer screening on mortality, both suggest that prostate cancer screening leads to overdetection and overtreatment of some patients. Therefore, men should be informed of the risks and benefits of prostate cancer screening before biopsy and the option of active surveillance.

### Lifetime benefits and harms of prostate-specific antigen-based risk-stratified screening for prostate cancer [^111DZPBh]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2020). Low credibility.

It has long been understood that controlling the harm–benefit trade-off of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening is critical for its sustainability. Strategies for reducing harms while preserving benefits include screening less frequently, using higher thresholds for biopsy referral in older men, and tailoring screening algorithms by PSA level.

The recommendation to stratify screening by PSA level is largely based on studies that stored ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid plasma in an unscreened cohort of Swedish men aged 44–60 years in the 1980s. Prostate cancer cases diagnosed up to 25 years later had statistically significantly higher PSA levels at their baseline blood draw than those not diagnosed. There was also a strong association between baseline PSA and prostate cancer mortality: 44% of prostate cancer deaths occurred in men with PSA in the top 10% of the PSA distribution at ages 44–49 years. In addition, only 0.2% of men with PSA below 1.0 ng/mL at age 60 years died from prostate cancer within 25 years.

Other studies, including screened and unscreened cohorts, have confirmed that baseline PSA predicts the risk of future prostate cancer diagnosis or prostate cancer death. These studies have motivated proposals to tailor the screening intensity to a man's PSA level. However, the implications of such stratified policies for clinically important outcomes, such as prostate cancer deaths or overdiagnosis, compared with practices, have not been evaluated. Despite this, some guidelines are already incorporating PSA-stratified screening.

### The effect of the USPSTF PSA screening recommendation on prostate cancer incidence patterns in the United States [^1177pw2c]. Nature Reviews Urology (2017). Low credibility.

Guidelines regarding recommendations for PSA screening for early detection of prostate cancer are conflicting. In 2012, the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) assigned a grade of D (recommending against screening) for men aged ≥ 75 years in 2008 and for men of all ages in 2012. Understanding temporal trends in rates of screening before and after the 2012 recommendation in terms of usage patterns in PSA screening, changes in prostate cancer incidence and biopsy patterns, and how the recommendation has influenced physicians' and men's attitudes about PSA screening and subsequent ordering of other screening tests is essential within the scope of prostate cancer screening policy.

Since the 2012 recommendation, rates of PSA screening decreased by 3–10% in all age groups and across most geographical regions of the United States. Rates of prostate biopsy and prostate cancer incidence have declined in unison, with a shift towards tumors being of higher grade and stage upon detection. Despite the recommendation, some physicians report ongoing willingness to screen appropriately selected men, and many men report intending to continue to ask for the PSA test from their physician. In the coming years, we expect to have an improved understanding of whether these decreased rates of screening will affect prostate cancer metastasis and mortality.

### The new US Preventive Services Task Force "C" draft recommendation for prostate cancer screening [^116ds3gH]. European Urology (2017). Low credibility.

The US Preventive Services Task Force has issued a new draft guideline, with a "C" recommendation that men aged 55–69 years should be informed about the benefits and harms of screening for prostate cancer and offered prostate-specific antigen testing if they choose it. For men aged 70 years and older, the recommendation remains "D", or "do not screen".

This draft represents substantial progress in the right direction towards offering men a fair opportunity to discuss the risks and benefits of screening with their primary care providers. However, the evidence review underlying the draft remains fundamentally inadequate, leading to biased presentations of both benefits and harms of screening. The final guideline and future revisions should reflect formal engagement with subject matter experts to optimize the advice given to men and their physicians.

### Prostate-specific antigen-based screening: Controversy and guidelines [^1177mDjo]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Although prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening has improved the detection of prostate cancer, allowing for stage migration to less advanced disease, the precise mortality benefit of early detection is unclear. This is in part due to a discrepancy between the two large randomized controlled trials comparing PSA screening to usual care. The European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC) found a survival benefit to screening, while the United States Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial did not. Furthermore, the benefit of immediate surgical intervention for screen-detected prostate cancer is unclear, as the results superficially differ between the two large randomized controlled trials comparing prostatectomy to observation. The Prostate Cancer Intervention Versus Observation Trial (PIVOT) found no survival benefit for prostatectomy in PSA screened U.S. men, while the Scandinavian Prostate Cancer Group Study Number Four (SPCG-4) found a survival benefit for prostatectomy in clinically diagnosed prostate cancer. As a result of the controversy surrounding PSA screening and subsequent prostate cancer treatment, guidelines vary widely by organization.

Prostate cancer diagnosis

Five trials provided information on the diagnosis of prostate cancer in 340,800 randomized participants. The Quebec study did not report on disease stages in the control arm. There were 10,328 men diagnosed with prostate cancer in the 159,372 men in the screening group compared to 7,968 in the 181,428 controls, resulting in a relative risk of 1.46 (1.21 to 1.77; P < 0.001; Fig 3) in favor of screening. There was a high degree of heterogeneity in these trials (I^2 = 97%, χ^2 = 126.69; P < 0.001).

The subgroup analysis for stage I prostate cancer was based on 3,789 men diagnosed with stage I prostate cancer among the 155,317 men in the screening group compared to 1,971 in the 177,426 control group, resulting in a relative risk of 1.95 (1.22 to 3.13; P = 0.005) in favor of screening (Fig 4). There was a high degree of heterogeneity (I^2 = 96%, χ^2 = 79.32; P < 0.001).

- **Figure 4: Effects of screening on prostate cancer stage at the time of diagnosis**

Stage II prostate cancer was diagnosed in 5,114 of the 155,317 men in the screening group and 4,035 of the 177,426 controls, resulting in a relative risk of 1.39 (0.99 to 1.95; P = 0.05; Fig 4). In this analysis, there was significant heterogeneity (I^2 = 97%, χ^2 = 114.38; P < 0.001).

Data on the detection of stages III and IV prostate cancer were based on 332,743 randomized participants. Stages III and IV cancer were diagnosed in 701 of 155,317 men enrolled in the screening group and 975 of 177,426 controls, resulting in a relative risk of 0.94.

### Discussing uncertainty and risk in primary care: Recommendations of a multi-disciplinary panel regarding communication around prostate cancer screening [^113CLpo6]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Balanced discussions between clinicians and patients about disease screening remain problematic. Objective disease screening discussions are influenced by over 50 years of public health efforts that convey "do not delay" messages for cancer screening. Overall, the public has an enthusiasm for health screening. This enthusiasm for cancer screening persists even when they understand the risks of false-positive results — identifying "abnormalities" that have a dubious impact on health but may result in a cascade of costly and often aggressive medical interventions.

Physicians often worry about liability issues that might arise from a missed diagnosis resulting from a decision not to screen. Primary care physicians have limited time for complex medical discussions, possess limited training in effective shared decision-making techniques, and are often not updated at the time of writing on the latest evidence. Additionally, tension exists between specialists who see patients with advanced disease (and therefore push for aggressive screening) and primary care/population health groups who see the myriad of complications from over-diagnosis.

Public and private agencies are seeking methods to help patients make complex medical decisions that go beyond providing written material or engaging in brief discussions. Typically, health messages fail for various reasons: the type of message delivered, method of delivery, lack of message reinforcement, lack of access to recommended care, non-acceptance on the part of the individual, and inappropriate education level. Similarly, expert consensus groups have…

### Prostate cancer — to screen, or not to screen, is that the question [^114YXpZM]. BMC Urology (2008). Low credibility.

There continues to be controversy regarding serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and prostate cancer screening. We anxiously await the results of two large prospective randomized clinical trials: the Prostate, Lung, Colon, and Ovary (PCLO) screening trial in the US and the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC) in Europe, assessing the benefits of prostate cancer screening. However, the true question to answer may be which cancer to treat and when we should treat it.

### Lifetime benefits and harms of prostate-specific antigen-based risk-stratified screening for prostate cancer [^115Uy1Dj]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2020). Low credibility.

Although using two models that simultaneously approximate high-dimensional empirical data from two sources creates some robustness around the main result, it also leaves the primary scientific question partially unanswered. The models concur that a key effect of stratifying screening by PSA level is a large reduction in testing burden. The models also agree about the effects of lengthening screening intervals for men with low PSA. The models predict quantitatively different effects of early cessation for men with low PSA at age 60 years and older. Nevertheless, the models agree qualitatively across all settings that PSA-stratified strategies will lead to modest reductions in both overdiagnoses and lives saved, and therefore these strategies are ready to be evaluated in a clinical setting.

Limitations of this study include the necessary simplification of biology represented by disease models and the difficulty in quantifying uncertainty around model projections. Discrepancies between the empirical and model-predicted probabilities of prostate cancer diagnosis may be due at least in part to the unknown proportion of men who received screening tests in the later years in Sweden, which probably increased the probability of diagnosis in the observed data, and to the low number of men with baseline PSA greater than 1.5 ng/mL, leading to uncertainty in the predicted probability of diagnosis for men with PSA levels in this range. Several assumptions were made to simplify comparisons across strategies. We assumed 100% of men received biopsy following a positive PSA test.

The update of the 2008 U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation statement focuses on screening for prostate cancer.

- **Methods**: The USPSTF reviewed new evidence on the benefits and harms of prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-based screening for prostate cancer, as well as the benefits and harms of treatment of localized prostate cancer.

- **Recommendation**: The USPSTF recommends against PSA-based screening for prostate cancer (grade D recommendation). This recommendation applies to men in the general U.S. population, regardless of age. It does not include the use of the PSA test for surveillance after diagnosis or treatment of prostate cancer; this use of the PSA test is outside the scope of the USPSTF.

The burden of prostate cancer is increasing. Therefore, a contemporary, organized, risk-stratified program for early detection must be implemented. This approach aims to reduce both the harm from the disease and the potential for overdiagnosis and overtreatment. At the same time, it seeks to avoid underdiagnosis, thereby considerably improving the harm-to-benefit ratio.

### Screening for prostate cancer: US Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^112V81V9]. JAMA (2018). High credibility.

In the United States, the lifetime risk of being diagnosed with prostate cancer is approximately 13%, and the lifetime risk of dying from prostate cancer is 2.5%. The median age of death from prostate cancer is 80 years. Many men with prostate cancer never experience symptoms and, without screening, would never know they have the disease. African American men and men with a family history of prostate cancer have an increased risk compared to other men.

The objective of this study is to update the 2012 US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation on prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-based screening for prostate cancer.

The evidence review by the USPSTF focused on the benefits and harms of PSA-based screening and the subsequent treatment of screen-detected prostate cancer. The USPSTF also commissioned a review of existing decision analysis models and the overdiagnosis rate of PSA-based screening. The reviews examined the benefits and harms for patient subpopulations at higher risk, including older men, African American men, and men with a family history of prostate cancer.

Adequate evidence from randomized clinical trials indicates that PSA-based screening programs in men aged 55 to 69 years may prevent approximately 1.3 deaths from prostate cancer over 13 years per 1000 men screened. These programs may also prevent approximately 3 cases of metastatic prostate cancer per 1000 men screened. Potential harms of screening include frequent false-positive results.

### Prostate cancer screening [^116MUTHh]. Current Oncology Reports (2011). Low credibility.

Prostate cancer is the most common cancer and the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in American men. Although the use of the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test for prostate cancer screening since the 1990s has led to increased early diagnoses, the most recent studies are in conflict about the risks and benefits of routine prostate cancer screening. Recently, evidence has emerged to support the use of the PSA test to lower mortality, but there is still concern that over-diagnosis may lead to over-treatment of cancers that would not significantly affect patients' health for several years. This article describes the results of important recent prostate cancer screening trials, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network and American Cancer Society screening guidelines, and discusses the implications for clinical practice.

### Benefits and harms of prostate-specific antigen screening for prostate cancer: An evidence update for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force [^111x46EA]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Prostate cancer is the most common nonskin cancer among men in the United States, and screening for prostate cancer has increased in recent years. In 2002, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force concluded that evidence was insufficient to recommend for, or against screening for prostate cancer using prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing.

- **Purpose**: To examine new evidence on the benefits and harms of screening asymptomatic men for prostate cancer with PSA.

- **Data sources**: English-language articles identified in PubMed and the Cochrane Library (search dates: January 2002 to July 2007), reference lists of retrieved articles, and expert suggestions.

- **Study selection**: Randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses of PSA screening, as well as cross-sectional and cohort studies of screening harms and the natural history of screening-detected cancer, were selected to address the following questions: Does screening for prostate cancer with PSA, as a single-threshold test or as a function of multiple tests over time, decrease morbidity or mortality? What are the magnitude and nature of harms associated with prostate cancer screening, other than overtreatment? What is the natural history of PSA-detected, nonpalpable, localized prostate cancer?

- **Data extraction**: Studies were reviewed, abstracted, and rated for quality using predefined U.S. Preventive Services Task Force criteria.

- **Data synthesis**: No high-quality randomized controlled trials of screening for prostate cancer have been completed. In one cross-sectional and two prospective cohort studies of fair to good quality, false-positive results were noted.

### Discussing uncertainty and risk in primary care: Recommendations of a multi-disciplinary panel regarding communication around prostate cancer screening [^11728te3]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

How can screening for life-threatening diseases be harmful?

While many screening tests have improved the quantity and quality of a person's life through early detection of life-threatening or life-altering diseases, other tests have failed to deliver due to inaccuracy, poor performance, unavailable treatments, high costs, treatment complications, or health providers who are unaware of the screening controversies. Prostate cancer screening with the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) blood test epitomizes this controversy. Prostate cancer accounts for about 29,000 cancer deaths annually in the US, yet millions of men may have undetected prostate cancer — the vast majority of whom will remain asymptomatic throughout their life. At the population level, prostate cancer treatment has only a marginal mortality benefit. PSA as a screening test has reasonable sensitivity to detect aggressive prostate cancers (91%), but cannot distinguish between low- and high-risk prostate cancers. This results in substantial overdiagnosis, with attendant treatment complications of impotence, incontinence, and surgical mortality, in men who would have remained asymptomatic.

For controversial conditions such as prostate cancer screening (PrCS), the medical encounter needs to focus on discussion and education to help patients reach value-concordant decisions. Value-concordant decision-making can be enhanced using shared decision-making techniques to clarify issues. In shared decision-making, medical knowledge (risks, harms, and benefits of diagnosis and treatment) is presented in a way that enables patients to make informed choices.

### Screening for prostate cancer: A guidance statement from the Clinical Guidelines Committee of the American College of Physicians [^113yDtR1]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Prostate cancer is an important health problem in men. It rarely causes death in men younger than 50 years; most deaths associated with it occur in men older than 75 years. The benefits of screening with the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test are outweighed by the harms for most men. Prostate cancer never becomes clinically significant in a patient's lifetime in a considerable proportion of men with prostate cancer detected with the PSA test. They will receive no benefit and are subject to substantial harms from the treatment of prostate cancer.

The American College of Physicians (ACP) developed this guidance statement for clinicians by assessing prostate cancer screening guidelines developed by other organizations. ACP believes that it is more valuable to provide clinicians with a rigorous review of available guidelines rather than develop a new guideline on the same topic when several guidelines are available on a topic or when existing guidelines conflict. The purpose of this guidance statement is to critically review available guidelines to help guide internists and other clinicians in making decisions about screening for prostate cancer. The target patient population for this guidance statement is all adult men.

This guidance statement is derived from an appraisal of available guidelines on screening for prostate cancer. Authors searched the National Guideline Clearinghouse to identify prostate cancer screening guidelines in the United States and selected four developed by the American College of Preventive Medicine and the American Cancer Society.

### Changes in prostate-specific antigen testing relative to the revised US Preventive Services Task Force recommendation on prostate cancer screening [^111mYi62]. JAMA Oncology (2022). High credibility.

In April 2017, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) published a draft guideline that reversed its 2012 guidance advising against prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-based screening for prostate cancer in all men (grade D), instead endorsing individual decision-making for men aged 55 to 69 years (grade C).

The objective of this study was to evaluate changes in rates of PSA testing after revisions in the USPSTF guideline on prostate cancer screening.

This retrospective cohort study used deidentified claims data from Blue Cross Blue Shield beneficiaries aged 40 to 89 years from January 1, 2013, through December 31, 2019.

- **Exposures**: Publication of the USPSTF's draft (April 2017) and final (May 2018) recommendation on prostate cancer screening.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Age-adjusted rates of PSA testing in bimonthly periods were calculated, and PSA testing rates from calendar years before (January 1 to December 31, 2016) and after (January 1 to December 31, 2019) the guideline change were compared. Interrupted time series analyses were used to evaluate the association of the draft (April 2017) and published (May 2018) USPSTF guideline with rates of PSA testing. Changes in rates of PSA testing were further evaluated among beneficiaries within the age categories reflected in the guideline: 40 to 54 years, 55 to 69 years, and 70 to 89 years.

- **Results**: The median number of eligible beneficiaries for each bimonthly period was 8,087,565 (range, 6,407,602–8,747,308), and the median age of all included eligible beneficiaries was 53 years (IQR, 47–59).

### Prostate cancer screening with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test: a clinical practice guideline [^113VVTup]. BMJ (2018). Low credibility.

Guidelines on PSA testing vary in their recommendations (see table 1). The Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care recommends against PSA screening for men aged 55 to 69 years. However, the US Preventive Services Task Force recently changed its guidance, stating that "the decision about whether to be screened for prostate cancer should be an individual one", without clearly suggesting for, or against screening. Previously, it recommended against screening in that group. The National Cancer Center Network (NCCN), which represents cancer centers in the United States, recommends initiating PSA screening at age 45 years. Guidelines from the American Urological Association (AUA) and European Association of Urology (EAU) recommend a discussion about PSA screening with patients.

- **Major guideline recommendations on PSA screening**: Uptake of PSA testing has dramatically increased the incidence of prostate cancer over the last quarter century. This increase is associated with the widespread use of PSA testing, which detects early-stage prostate cancers. There is wide variation in the adoption of prostate cancer screening. In the UK, about 39% of men aged 45–69 years have undergone PSA testing in the past 10 years. In Sweden, 23% of men aged 50–69 had a PSA test in the previous 12 months and 58% in the previous 10 years. Although screening rates have declined during the past decade in the US, up to half of US men aged 60–74 undergo screening each year. Additionally, as many as 33% of elderly US men with competing medical comorbidities have also undergone screening.

### Public knowledge of benefits of breast and prostate cancer screening in Europe [^114bUr6Q]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2009). Low credibility.

Women and men in countries with modern health systems are confronted with the question of whether to participate in screening for breast cancer and prostate cancer. Because screening can also lead to harms, such as overtreatment, they need to understand the potential benefits of these screening programs before making informed decisions about participating. Ideally, physicians, health pamphlets, and other information sources should assist in clarifying the actual size of benefits.

Screening for breast cancer with mammography is widely encouraged by governmental programs in both the European Union (EU) and the United States under the assumption that the screening programs save lives. In the case of breast cancer, an analysis of randomized trials involving approximately 247,000 women aged 40–74 years showed that for every 1,000 women who participated in screening, 3.9 diagnosed with breast cancer died, compared with 5.0 among those who did not participate. The follow-up time ranged between 5.8 and 20.2 years. Thus, the absolute risk reduction was on the order of one in 1,000. The authors of a recent review of six trials involving half a million women estimated the absolute risk reduction to be approximately one in 2,000. Note that this benefit relates to fewer breast cancer deaths; no reduction in mortality from all cancers or other causes was found. Whether the potential of screening to reduce breast cancer mortality outweighs the harms of overdiagnosis and overtreatment is still under discussion.

### Screening for prostate cancer: Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^1165JLm7]. BMJ (2010). Low credibility.

In this systematic review and meta-analysis of prostate cancer screening, we failed to find a significant impact of prostate cancer screening on overall mortality or death from prostate cancer, which are the most critical outcomes for patients. Evidence for both all-cause mortality and death from prostate cancer was of moderate quality according to the GRADE approach. In contrast, based on low-quality evidence, screening was associated with a 46% relative increase in diagnoses of prostate cancer in the screening arm compared with no screening. A predefined subgroup analysis based on disease stage indicated that this relative increase was attributable mainly to an increase in the number of men diagnosed with stage I prostate cancer. There was no significant impact of screening on the diagnosis of stage II and stages III and IV prostate cancer. These findings suggest that screening leads to an increase in diagnosis of early-stage prostate cancer that does not seem to translate into a benefit in overall survival and survival specific to prostate cancer. On average, 20 more men will be detected with prostate cancer (95% confidence interval 9 to 34) per 1000 patients screened. The finding that an increased rate of diagnosis fails to translate into improved overall and disease-specific mortality rates is probably multifactorial and relates in part to the prolonged and relatively slow natural course in many patients, particularly those with low-grade prostate cancer. Our results confirm previously voiced concerns about overdiagnosis of prostate cancer — that is, detection of cases that are unlikely to benefit the patient.

### The case for tailored prostate cancer screening: An NCCN perspective [^112c5bk8]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2015). Low credibility.

A preponderance of clinical evidence supports a significant public health benefit for screening and early detection of prostate cancer in selected men. The challenge lies in maximizing early diagnosis of potentially aggressive but curable disease while minimizing diagnosis and treatment of indolent disease. A tailored approach to population screening in appropriately counseled men, using an evidence-based strategy with judicious prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing, will reduce prostate-cancer mortality yet limit overdetection of clinically insignificant disease.

Use of newer biomarkers that increase specificity for prostate cancer detection, including percentage of free PSA, 4Kscore, prostate health index, prostate cancer antigen 3, and multiparametric MRI, may be considered under certain circumstances.

### Prostate specific antigen best practice statement: 2009 update [^115DeKkw]. The Journal of Urology (2009). Low credibility.

We provide information on the use of PSA testing for the evaluation of men at risk for prostate cancer, and the risks and benefits of early detection.

- **Materials and methods**: The report is a summary of the American Urological Association PSA Best Practice Policy 2009. The summary statement is based on a review of the professional literature, clinical experience, and the expert opinions of a multispecialty panel. It is intended to serve as a resource for physicians, other health care professionals, and patients. It does not establish a fixed set of guidelines, define the legal standard of care, or pre-empt physician judgment in individual cases.

- **Results**: There are two notable differences in the policy. First, the age for obtaining a baseline PSA has been lowered to 40 years. Secondly, the policy no longer recommends a single, threshold value of PSA which should prompt prostate biopsy. Rather, the decision to proceed to prostate biopsy should be based primarily on PSA and DRE results, but should take into account multiple factors including free and total PSA, patient age, PSA velocity, PSA density, family history, ethnicity, prior biopsy history, and comorbidities.

- **Conclusions**: Although recently published trials show different results regarding the impact of prostate cancer screening on mortality, both suggest that prostate cancer screening leads to overdetection and overtreatment of some patients. Therefore, men should be informed of the risks and benefits of prostate cancer screening before biopsy and the option of active surveillance.

### Screening for prostate cancer: Evidence, ongoing trials, policies and knowledge gaps [^116TQ29s]. BMJ Oncology (2023). Low credibility.

Long-term screening with serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and systematic prostate biopsies can reduce prostate cancer mortality but leads to unacceptable overdiagnosis. Over the past decade, diagnostic methods have improved, and the indolent nature of low-grade prostate cancer has been established. These advances now enable more selective detection of potentially lethal prostate cancer. This non-systematic review summarises relevant diagnostic advances, previous and ongoing screening trials, healthcare policies, and important remaining knowledge gaps.

Evidence synthesis shows a strong association between low serum PSA values and minimal long-term risk of prostate cancer death, allowing for adjusted screening intervals. The use of risk calculators, biomarkers, and MRI to select men with a raised PSA value for biopsy, and the targeting of lesions rather than systematic prostate biopsies, reduce the detection of low-grade cancer and thereby overdiagnosis. These improvements recently led the European Union to recommend its member states evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of organized screening programmes for prostate cancer.

Nonetheless, important knowledge gaps remain, such as the performance of modern diagnostic methods in long-term screening programmes and their impact on mortality. These knowledge gaps are currently being addressed in three large randomised screening trials. Population-based pilot programmes will contribute critical practical experience.

### Screening for prostate cancer with the prostate-specific antigen test: A review of current evidence [^113Qqr27]. JAMA (2014). Low credibility.

Prostate cancer screening with the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test remains controversial. This review aims to evaluate evidence from randomized trials and related modeling studies to assess the effect of PSA screening versus no screening on prostate cancer-specific mortality, and to suggest an approach balancing potential benefits and harms.

- **Evidence acquisition**: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials were searched from January 1, 2010, to April 3, 2013, for PSA screening trials to update a previous systematic review. Another search was conducted in EMBASE and MEDLINE to identify modeling studies extending the results of the two large randomized trials identified. The American Heart Association Evidence-Based Scoring System was employed to rate the level of evidence.

- **Results**: Two trials — the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) screening trial and the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC) — dominate the evidence regarding PSA screening. The PLCO trial demonstrated an increase in cancer incidence in the screening group (relative risk [RR], 1.12; 95% CI, 1.07–1.17) but no cancer-specific mortality benefit to PSA screening following a 13-year follow-up (RR, 1.09; 95% CI, 0.87–1.36). In contrast, the ERSPC showed an increase in cancer incidence with screening (RR, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.57–1.69) and an improvement in the risk of prostate cancer-specific death after 11 years (RR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.68–0.91). The ERSPC documented that 37 additional men needed to receive a diagnosis through screening for every one fewer prostate cancer death.

### Early detection of prostate cancer: AUA guideline [^112b8sAe]. The Journal of Urology (2013). Low credibility.

The purpose of the guideline is to provide urologists with a framework for the early detection of prostate cancer in asymptomatic average-risk men.

- **Materials and methods**: A systematic review was conducted and summarized evidence derived from over 300 studies addressing predefined outcomes such as prostate cancer incidence/mortality, quality of life, diagnostic accuracy, and harms of testing. Along with the quality of evidence, the panel considered values and preferences expressed in a clinical setting (patient-physician dyad) over a public health perspective. Guideline statements were organized by age groups: < 40, 40–54, 55–69, and ≥ 70 years.
- **Results**: Except for prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-based prostate cancer screening, minimal evidence assessed the outcomes for other tests. The quality of evidence for screening benefits was moderate, while harm was high for men aged 55 to 69 years. For men outside this age range, evidence was lacking for benefits, but the harms, including overdiagnosis and overtreatment, persisted. Modeled data suggested that a screening interval of two years or more might reduce these harms.
- **Conclusions**: The panel recommended shared decision-making for men aged 55 to 69 years considering PSA-based screening, as benefits may outweigh harms for this target group. Outside this age range, routine PSA-based screening could not be recommended based on the available evidence.

### Viewpoint: Limiting prostate cancer screening [^114UBZ33]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Prostate cancer screening is controversial, and major professional associations offer differing screening guidelines. The author addresses three key issues about prostate cancer screening: 1) the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) criteria to recommend a prostate biopsy, 2) the appropriate age to start screening, and 3) the appropriate age to stop screening. The author argues, on the basis of evidence published since 2000, that data supporting the efficacy of PSA screening remain unconvincing. The author recommends that screening should not be expanded to include average-risk men younger than age 50 years or older than age 75 years and that a PSA threshold below 4.0 ng/mL should not be used to trigger biopsy referral.

A. Vickers and S. Carlsson: You have generally been perceived as an individual who is skeptical about prostate cancer screening. What do you think policy should be; should there be no screening ever? That is, should PSA be avoided entirely in asymptomatic men, or should screening be restricted to certain subgroups and, if so, whom? Please justify your answer.

### Prostate cancer mortality in areas with high and low prostate cancer incidence [^112nAQX4]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2014). Low credibility.

Use of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening for the detection of prostate cancer remains controversial. Two large, population-based, randomized clinical trials — the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC) and the Göteborg trial — demonstrated 21% to 44% statistically significant decreases in prostate cancer–specific mortality after 11 to 14 years of follow-up in screened versus unscreened men. In contrast, the prostate arm of the US Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian cancer screening trial (PLCO) found no benefit from systematic screening compared with opportunistic screening.

Thus, a controversy on PSA screening still remains. In 2012, the US Preventive Services Task Force recommended against screening, stating, "there is moderate to high certainty that the benefits of PSA-based screening for prostate cancer [in terms of reduced prostate cancer mortality] do not outweigh the harm [in terms of overdiagnosis]". This recommendation has been criticized, and more data on the association between PSA screening and prostate cancer mortality are needed.

In addition to extended data from the ERSPC and the Göteborg trial, and the awaited results from the ongoing UK ProtecT trial, carefully designed and conducted observational population-based studies may provide valuable information on the association between PSA testing, early diagnosis, and treatment and prostate cancer mortality. Results from previous observational studies have been inconsistent; some studies have shown decreased prostate cancer mortality in areas with high PSA testing, whereas others.

### Shared decision making emphasized for prostate screening [^115yssCo]. Cancer Discovery (2018). Low credibility.

The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) now recommends that men ages 55 to 69 individually decide, in consultation with their physician, whether to undergo PSA screening for prostate cancer. The guidelines represent a change from 2012 when the USPSTF recommended against screening for all men.

### Lifetime benefits and harms of prostate-specific antigen-based risk-stratified screening for prostate cancer [^112mNkxS]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2020). Low credibility.

Using calibrated models, we simulated cohorts of men in the United States aged 45 or 50 years in 2017, following them until age 85 years. We implemented the following screening strategies:

- **Screening strategies**: Screening up to age 69 years with 2-year intervals; lengthening the interval to 8 years for baseline PSA less than 1.0 ng/mL, reverting to 2 years if PSA exceeds 1.0 ng/mL in subsequent screens; stopping screening when PSA is less than 1.0 ng/mL for individuals aged 60 and older; or a combination of the previous two strategies. For reference, strategies ceasing all screenings at age 60 were also assessed. In all approaches, a PSA threshold of 4.0 ng/mL was applied.

To evaluate the optimal strategy, a compliance rate of 100% attendance at each screening was specified, with follow-up biopsies also having 100% compliance and sensitivity. For each strategy, we projected the number of tests conducted, cancers diagnosed (both screen-detected and clinically detected), overdiagnoses, lives saved, and life-years gained.

### Screening for prostate cancer: Evidence, ongoing trials, policies and knowledge gaps [^113kUB9u]. BMJ Oncology (2023). Low credibility.

Long-term screening with serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and systematic prostate biopsies can reduce prostate cancer mortality but leads to unacceptable overdiagnosis. Over the past decade, diagnostic methods have improved, and the indolent nature of low-grade prostate cancer has been established. These advances now enable more selective detection of potentially lethal prostate cancer. This non-systematic review summarizes relevant diagnostic advances, previous and ongoing screening trials, healthcare policies, and important remaining knowledge gaps.

- **Evidence synthesis**: The strong association between low serum PSA values and minimal long-term risk of prostate cancer death allows for adjusting screening intervals. The use of risk calculators, biomarkers, and MRI to select men with a raised PSA value for biopsy and lesion-targeting rather than systematic prostate biopsies reduces the detection of low-grade cancer and thereby overdiagnosis. These improvements recently led the European Union to recommend its member states to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of organised screening programmes for prostate cancer.

- **Knowledge gaps**: Important knowledge gaps remain, such as the performance of modern diagnostic methods in long-term screening programmes and their impact on mortality. These gaps are currently being addressed in three large randomised screening trials. Population-based pilot programmes will contribute critical practical experience.

### Screening for prostate cancer [^113LUgXN]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Any form of screening aims to reduce disease-specific and overall mortality and to improve a person's future quality of life. Screening for prostate cancer has generated considerable debate within the medical and broader community, as demonstrated by the varying recommendations made by medical organizations and governed by national policies. To better inform individual patient decision-making and health policy decisions, we need to consider the entire body of data from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on prostate cancer screening summarised in a systematic review. In 2006, our Cochrane review identified insufficient evidence to either support or refute the use of routine mass, selective, or opportunistic screening for prostate cancer. An update of the review in 2010 included three additional trials. Meta-analysis of the five studies included in the 2010 review concluded that screening did not significantly reduce prostate cancer-specific mortality. In the past two years, several updates to studies included in the 2010 review have been published, thereby providing the rationale for this update of the 2010 systematic review.

- **Objectives**: To determine whether screening for prostate cancer reduces prostate cancer-specific mortality or all-cause mortality and to assess its impact on quality of life and adverse events.

- **Search methods**: An updated search of electronic databases (PROSTATE register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CANCERLIT, and the NHS EED) was performed, in addition to handsearching of specific journals.

### Early detection of prostate cancer: AUA/SUO guideline part I: Prostate cancer screening [^114CjTvN]. The Journal of Urology (2023). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for prostate cancer, more specifically with respect to indications for screening, general considerations, AUA/SUO 2023 guidelines recommend repeating PSA before a secondary biomarker, imaging, or biopsy in patients with newly elevated PSA.

### Prostate specific antigen density: Is there a role for this parameter when screening for prostate cancer [^112X11Jx]. Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

The objective of this paper is to validate the routine use of prostate specific antigen (PSA) density (PSAD) to enhance PSA specificity in men with normal digital rectal examinations and intermediate PSA values. This retrospective study involves 235 men from a prostate cancer (PCa) screening program, all of whom presented PSA values between 4 and 10 ng/ml, had normal digital rectal examinations, and a transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) guided biopsy available (PSA ≥ 4 ng/ml as the sole criterion for biopsy).

Multivariate analysis failed to demonstrate higher PSAD values in men with PCa. PSAD cutoff points higher than 0.07 ng/ml per cc were deemed unacceptable, with sensitivity less than 95%. When a cutoff point of 0.15 was considered, as many as 30.6% of the cancers were missed. Therefore, we cannot recommend the use of this parameter for the aforementioned purpose.

### Prostate cancer screening with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test: A clinical practice guideline [^113TBkoF]. BMJ (2018). Low credibility.

The Rapid Recommendations executive believed that this new study, along with extended follow-up data from existing trials, necessitated a new appraisal of the body of evidence for patients and clinicians.

Although the results of this study suggest that screening may not be worthwhile, several guidelines advocate offering screening in some cases. The study was significantly larger than previous studies, and existing trials had published more extended follow-up results. The BMJ Rapid Recommendations team considered these factors important enough to warrant a new appraisal of the body of evidence. This guideline aims to promptly and transparently translate potentially practice-changing evidence into usable recommendations for clinicians and patients, based on the GRADE framework and in adherence to standards for trustworthy guidelines.

- **Panel recommendation**: The panel suggests against systematic PSA screening (weak recommendation). Panel members determined that most men will decline screening because the benefit is small and uncertain, and there are clear harms. However, there is likely considerable variation in values and preferences. Men with a family history of prostate cancer, African descent, or a lower socioeconomic status, who have a higher baseline risk of prostate cancer death, may be more inclined to choose PSA screening. Shared decision-making is essential for men considering screening.

### Prostate cancer early detection, version 1.2014. Featured updates to the NCCN guidelines [^111GkQms]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2014). Low credibility.

The NCCN guidelines for prostate cancer early detection provide recommendations for men choosing to participate in an early detection program for prostate cancer. These NCCN guidelines insights highlight notable recent updates. Overall, the 2014 update represents a more streamlined and concise set of recommendations. The panel stratified the age ranges at which initiating testing for prostate cancer should be considered. Indications for biopsy include both a cutpoint and the use of multiple risk variables in combination. In addition to other biomarkers of specificity, the Prostate Health Index has been included to aid biopsy decisions in certain men, given recent FDA approvals.

### Screening for prostate cancer: US Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^111rsE6o]. JAMA (2018). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for prostate cancer, more specifically with respect to indications for screening, the USPSTF 2018 guidelines recommend individualizing the decision on obtaining screening for prostate cancer in males aged 55–69 years. This should involve a discussion of potential benefits and harms of screening based on factors such as family history, race/ethnicity, comorbid medical conditions, patient values about the benefits and harms of screening, treatment-specific outcomes, and other health needs.

It is important to recognize that screening offers a small potential benefit of reducing the chance of death from prostate cancer in some males of this age group. However, many males will experience potential harms of screening, including false-positive results requiring additional testing and possible prostate biopsy, overdiagnosis and overtreatment, and treatment complications, such as incontinence and erectile dysfunction. It is advised not to obtain screening in individuals who do not express a preference for it.

### Ethnicity and prostate cancer: The way to solve the screening problem [^115YGDcP]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

We believe this approach does not adequately address the conundrum. We should focus on risk-stratifying men based on the best harm-to-benefit ratio. Screening should then be actively offered only if the harm-to-benefit ratio strongly favors the benefits. It should be requested by the individual and discussed in cases of an ambivalent harm-to-benefit ratio, and avoided in men with no benefit, but mostly harms.

Several methods for achieving this better than average harm-to-benefit ratio were studied. Based on modeling data from the ERSPC, limiting screening to specific age groups (i.e. two to three screens between the ages of 55 and 59 years) was shown to maximize the harm-to-benefit ratio. Others suggested starting screening at an even earlier age, stratifying men based on a baseline PSA value, and only actively offering screening to men within the highest 10% risk of prostate cancer death. In fact, this strategy was shown to produce a better risk-to-benefit ratio compared to stratifying men based on race or family history of prostate cancer. Once screening starts, optimizing the harm-to-benefit ratio could be achieved by stratifying men for further, potentially harmful or burdensome testing (e.g. biopsy or an MRI). This has been shown possible by using developed and validated risk calculators and is recommended in guidelines, such as those from the European Association of Urology.

### PSA-based screening for prostate cancer: How does it compare with other cancer screening tests [^115JVk8j]. European Urology (2008). Low credibility.

Despite the substantial societal impact of prostate cancer, the medical community is currently divided on the balance between the benefits and harms of screening for prostate cancer using prostate-specific antigen (PSA).

- **Objective**: To examine whether PSA-based screening for prostate cancer meets guidelines on efficacy and effectiveness for screening, and how it compares with other currently implemented cancer-screening methods.

- **Evidence acquisition**: A literature search was conducted for reviews and individual studies that have examined the performance of screening for colorectal, cervical, breast, and prostate cancer. Each screening method was assessed using the United Kingdom National Screening Committee guidelines. Data on screening test performance (sensitivity, specificity, etc) were extracted from these articles for comparison.

- **Evidence synthesis**: In common with other cancers for which screening is conducted, prostate cancer represents a significant morbidity and mortality burden. The PSA test can be considered "simple" and "safe" within appropriate boundaries. The sensitivity and specificity profile of PSA is not optimal but has clinical validity. Cases missed at screening and detected as interval cases do not have a poor outcome. Early prostate cancer intervention can be beneficial for long-term outcomes, although the benefits need to be weighed against the adverse effects of intervention. Early evidence from screening studies also suggests positive stage and grade shifts, although Level 1 mortality data are still awaited. Robust cost-effectiveness data are still required.

### Screening for prostate cancer [^113Z4Xa3]. CA (2009). Low credibility.

In the United States, prostate cancer will affect 1 man in 6 during his lifetime. Since the mid-1980s, screening with the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) blood test has more than doubled the risk of a prostate cancer diagnosis. A decrease in prostate cancer death rates has been observed since that time, but the relative contribution of PSA testing, as opposed to other factors such as improved treatment, has been uncertain. The recent release of two large randomized trials suggests that if there is a benefit of screening, it is, at best, small. Methods to assess a man's risk of prostate cancer, including those tools that integrate multiple risk factors, are now available and should be used in risk assessment. Men undergoing screening for prostate cancer may reduce their risk of prostate cancer with finasteride.

### Screening for prostate cancer [^1128MRcj]. Lancet (2003). Low credibility.

Epidemiologically, screening is justified by the importance of the disease and the lack of prospects for primary prevention, but evidence from natural history is unhelpful since men are more likely to die with, rather than from, prostate cancer. The available screening tests do not always detect men whose lesions could result in future morbidity or mortality. Evidence is limited for the benefits of treatment for localized cancers detected through screening, whereas the evidence for harm is clear. Observational evidence for the effect of population screening programs is mixed, with no clear association between the intensity of screening and reduced prostate cancer mortality. Screening for prostate cancer cannot be justified in low-risk populations, but the balance of benefit and harm will be more favorable after risk stratification. Prostate cancer screening can be justified only in research programs designed to assess its effectiveness and help identify the groups who may benefit.

### Effect of the USPSTF grade D recommendation against screening for prostate cancer on incident prostate cancer diagnoses in the United States [^111fqjRt]. The Journal of Urology (2015). Low credibility.

In October 2011, the USPSTF (U.S. Preventive Services Task Force) issued a draft guideline discouraging prostate-specific antigen-based screening for prostate cancer (grade D recommendation). We evaluated the effect of the USPSTF guideline on the number and distribution of new prostate cancer diagnoses in the United States.

We identified incident cancers diagnosed between January 2010 and December 2012 in the NCDB (National Cancer Database). An interrupted time series was performed to evaluate the trend of new prostate cancers diagnosed each month before and after the draft guideline, using colon cancer as a comparator.

Incident monthly prostate cancer diagnoses decreased by 1,363 cases (12.2%, p < 0.01) in the month after the USPSTF draft guideline, and continued to decrease by 164 cases per month relative to baseline (-1.8%, p < 0.01). In contrast, monthly colon cancer diagnoses remained stable. Diagnoses of low, intermediate, and high-risk prostate cancers decreased significantly, but new diagnoses of nonlocalized disease did not change. Subgroups of age, comorbidity, race, income, and insurance showed comparable decreases in incident prostate cancer following the draft guideline.

There was a 28% decrease in incident diagnoses of prostate cancer in the year after the USPSTF draft recommendation against prostate-specific antigen screening. This study helps quantify the potential benefits (reduced harms of overdiagnosis and overtreatment of low-risk disease and disease found in elderly men) and potential harms (missed opportunities).

### The Lancet commission on prostate cancer: Planning for the surge in cases [^112NNXcV]. Lancet (2024). Low credibility.

Concerns about overdiagnosis and overtreatment continue to dominate the debate surrounding PSA-based screening in high-income countries (HICs). In 2017, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force issued an updated recommendation that men aged 55–69 years should be counseled about the benefits and harms of PSA screening because testing might be associated with a small survival benefit (a grade C recommendation). However, because advanced age is such a strong risk factor, voluntary screening programs, which are common in HICs, can result in over-testing in men aged 70 years or older and under-testing in men aged 50–70 years. Such under-testing is especially likely in younger men from ethnic minorities or deprived backgrounds — precisely the groups at highest risk of presentation with advanced disease and with the most life years to lose.

Substantial regional variations linked with patient-requested screening have also been noted. For example, the proportion of patients with advanced disease at presentation in the UK varies from 12.5% in London to 30% in Scotland. An individualized risk-adapted early-detection strategy is now recommended in international prostate cancer guidelines. In the European Association of Urology's PRAISE-U project, EU member states are comparing their different approaches to prostate cancer screening. All guidelines recognize the risk of overdiagnosis and the need to break the link between diagnosis and overtreatment without compromising the benefits that early detection could have for men with clinically significant prostate cancer.

### Screening for prostate cancer: Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^114diw8h]. BMJ (2010). Low credibility.

Prostate cancer is the most common non-skin cancer among men worldwide and, after lung cancer, is the second leading cause of cancer deaths among men in the United States. Screening has been advocated as a means of detecting prostate cancer in the early stages, which are amenable to local interventions with curative intent, to decrease overall and disease-specific mortality. The benefits and harms of prostate cancer screening, however, have become the topic of controversy, as reflected by numerous recent editorials, position statements, and guidance documents.

Population-based recommendations for cancer screening should ideally be based on high-quality evidence derived from systematic reviews of randomised controlled trials that document a positive impact of screening on outcomes that are the most important to patients. In 2006, a systematic review published in the Cochrane Library concluded that there was insufficient evidence to either support or refute the routine use of mass, selective, or opportunistic screening compared with no screening. This Cochrane systematic review was based on two randomised controlled trials that enrolled 55,512 participants overall but was limited by substantial methodological weaknesses in the design, conduct, and analysis of the included studies. The evidence drawn from this systematic review did not show that screening improved outcomes. By 2010, four additional trials enrolling 351,531 participants had been published, thereby providing strong impetus for an updated synthesis of research evidence.

### Randomized trial results did not resolve controversies surrounding prostate cancer screening [^117Dyxn1]. Current Opinion in Urology (2010). Low credibility.

Prostate cancer screening remains controversial. This review addresses recently published results from randomized controlled screening trials, as well as practice guidelines.

- **Recent findings**: The Prostate Lung Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial found that screening did not decrease prostate cancer mortality after 7 years of follow-up. High screening rates in the control group, the low number of deaths from prostate cancer, and the relatively short follow-up duration contributed to the negative results. The European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer found that screening reduced prostate cancer mortality by 20% during a median 9 years of follow-up. However, the absolute benefit (0.7/1000 reduction) was small and was associated with a 70% increase in prostate cancer diagnosis. Subsequently, the American Urological Association recommended beginning screening at the age of 40 years and not relying on a specific prostate-specific antigen cutoff for biopsy referral. The United States Preventive Services Task Force and American Cancer Society have yet to issue updated guidelines.

The randomized trials suggest that screening, at best, yields a small survival benefit but carries a substantial potential risk for overdiagnosis and overtreatment. Patients need to understand these trade-offs to make informed decisions about screening.

### Screening for prostate cancer: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^116kZYMu]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

The update of the 2002 U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation statement addresses screening for prostate cancer.

- **Methods**: The USPSTF evaluated randomized, controlled trials assessing the benefits of prostate cancer screening; cohort and cross-sectional studies on the psychological harms of false-positive prostate-specific antigen test results; and evidence on the natural history of prostate-specific antigen-detected prostate cancer. This evaluation aimed to address gaps previously identified in the 2002 USPSTF recommendation.

- **Recommendations**: Evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for prostate cancer in men younger than age 75 years (I statement). The recommendation is not to screen for prostate cancer in men age 75 years or older (Grade D recommendation).

### Physician attitudes and self-reported practices toward prostate cancer screening in black and white men [^1121zpy8]. Family Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Updated 2018 prostate cancer screening guidelines recommend informed decision-making discussions, which should include education on prostate cancer's disproportionate impact on Black men. It is unknown whether academic family physicians follow these guidelines.

- **Methods**: Family physicians were surveyed as part of the 2020 Council of Academic Family Medicine Educational Research Alliance (CERA) survey. We used χ2 to compare physicians' knowledge and screening practices stratified by physician age, gender, and percentage of Black patients in their patient panel. Logistic regressions were calculated predicting shared decision-making conversations, barriers to shared decision-making, inclusion of race in prostate cancer screening approach, and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing adjusted for physician age, gender, and percentage of Black patients.

- **Results**: Physicians reported engaging in shared decision-making for prostate cancer screening in half of eligible men. Only 29.2% of physicians reported routinely informing Black men of their increased prostate cancer risk. In logistic regressions, physician gender (female) and fewer Black patients in the panel (< 25%) were associated with lower frequency of shared decision-making with Black patients. Physician age (< 40 years) was associated with not discussing race during screening discussions (OR 2.24, 95% CI 1.55–3.23).

- **Conclusions**: Most academic family physicians do not appropriately inform Black men of increased prostate cancer risk, with younger physicians less likely to discuss race than older physicians.
