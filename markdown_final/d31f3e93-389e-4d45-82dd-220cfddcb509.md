## Question

Is Morpheus a non-ablative procedure?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether Morpheus8 is a non-ablative procedure. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the standard definitions that distinguish non-ablative, fractional, and ablative resurfacing. Then, I should verify the exact Morpheus8 technology and energy delivery. Next, I will examine histology and mechanism to see whether ablation zones are created. After that, I will position Morpheus8 on the ablative–non-ablative spectrum and compare it with non-ablative RF and fully ablative lasers. Finally, I will synthesize a precise classification and consider safety and downtime implications.

> Let me first confirm the definitions so I don't misclassify the device: ablative modalities remove or vaporize epidermal/dermal tissue creating open wounds that require re-epithelialization, non-ablative modalities heat the dermis while keeping the epidermal surface intact, and fractional approaches treat columns or zones in a grid to speed healing; there is also a "sublative" (sub-ablative) RF concept where limited surface disruption occurs with deeper coagulation while most of the epidermis is preserved.

> I need to check the exact technology of Morpheus8. The platform is a fractional radiofrequency microneedling system using 24 coated pins with adjustable penetration depths (about 1–4 mm), delivering bipolar RF through the needles for dermal and subdermal thermal effects; this is described as enabling coagulation of fat and contraction of the reticular dermis, consistent with subdermal remodeling [^116RQmWm] [^114SuX5X] [^114SuX5X].

> Wait, let me verify the histology and energy distribution because that determines classification: with Morpheus8, the distal uninsulated portion of each parylene-coated pin creates a compact zone of ablation at the tip, surrounded by necrotic and subnecrotic heating zones, indicating focal ablation plus broader coagulation; device architecture that enlarges the RF loop can deepen these coagulation/ablation zones; OCT work also shows channel-like defects after RF microneedling distinct from NAFL columns, supporting a needle-delivered thermal injury pattern while generally sparing most of the epidermis [^116RQmWm] [^114SuX5X] [^11417esq].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: at first glance one might label Morpheus8 "non-ablative" because the epidermis is largely preserved, but I should double-check whether any ablation occurs; the documented "compact zone of ablation" at each needle tip means it is not purely non-ablative, and its fractional pattern with limited surface involvement aligns better with sublative/minimally ablative RF concepts than with strictly non-ablative lasers; that said, the preserved epidermal lattice differentiates it from fully ablative lasers that broadly remove epidermis across the field [^116RQmWm] [^115q1LZc] [^114KfZyE].

> Next, I should review how it compares with fully ablative laser resurfacing in practice. Ablative CO2 technologies, whether traditional or fractional, are associated with greater surface ablation, longer healing, and higher risks such as scarring or PIH compared with RF microneedling; fractional CO2 histology shows wide ablation/coagulation columns and downtime on the order of days to weeks, whereas Morpheus8 typically heals faster because most epidermis is preserved and injury is confined to needle tracks and deeper tissue [^113eoe84] [^115ajXhw] [^111NyKiJ].

> I will now examine how it compares with truly non-ablative modalities. Nonablative monopolar RF and non-ablative fractional lasers heat without creating open epidermal wounds; by contrast, RF microneedling necessarily produces microchannels from the needles and, in this device, focal ablation at the tip, so it cannot be categorized alongside surface-intact non-ablative RF or NAFL despite sharing relatively short downtime and favorable tolerability profiles [^116oHePh] [^116RQmWm] [^11417esq].

> Let me consider safety and skin type issues to ensure the classification aligns with clinical behavior. RF microneedling, including fractional RF systems, has a favorable safety profile in diverse Fitzpatrick phototypes and can be repeated safely; this contrasts with higher pigmentary risk from fully ablative lasers in darker skin, further explaining why Morpheus8 is often grouped clinically with lower-downtime options despite its focal ablation at needle tips [^113eoe84] [^111NyKiJ].

> Synthesis time — But wait, what if I'm overstating ablation? The device's own histology confirms a compact ablation zone, so I should not call it purely non-ablative; the most accurate description is fractional RF microneedling that is minimally ablative (often termed "sublative") at the needle tips while preserving most of the epidermis, placing it between non-ablative RF/NAFL and fully ablative lasers; in everyday practice it is frequently discussed alongside non-ablative options because downtime is modest, but technically, the presence of tip-level ablation means it is best classified as sublative/minimally ablative fractional RF microneedling [^116RQmWm] [^115LWwb4] [^115q1LZc].

---

No, Morpheus8 is not strictly non-ablative; it is a **minimally ablative** technology [^114SuX5X] that uses microneedles to create microchannels [^11417esq] and deliver radiofrequency energy into the dermis, causing controlled coagulation and thermal injury while largely sparing the epidermis [^115LWwb4]. This approach balances efficacy with **minimal downtime** [^115q1LZc] and a favorable safety profile, especially for darker skin types [^113eoe84].

---

## Mechanism of action

Morpheus8 combines **microneedling with radiofrequency energy** [^113eoe84] to induce controlled thermal injury in the dermis, stimulating collagen and elastin production and remodeling subdermal adipose tissue [^115LWwb4]. The microneedles create microchannels that deliver RF energy directly into the dermis [^115LWwb4], coagulating targeted tissues and inducing thermal injury [^116mibjq]. This controlled injury triggers a **wound-healing response**, including neocollagenesis, elastogenesis, and angiogenesis [^116QiJLD], which improves skin texture, firmness, and overall appearance [^114KfZyE]. Adjustable penetration depth and energy settings allow clinicians to customize treatment based on individual patient needs and skin thickness [^116RQmWm] [^115LWwb4].

---

## Ablative vs. non-ablative technologies

- **Ablative technologies**, such as fractional CO2 lasers, remove the epidermis and part of the dermis [^114KfZyE], causing significant downtime, discomfort, and potential complications such as scarring and hyperpigmentation [^113s2zs5]. By contrast, **non-ablative technologies** heat the dermis without removing the epidermis [^1141YsiG], resulting in minimal downtime and fewer complications [^112aGqQ3].

Morpheus8 falls into the **minimally ablative (sublative)** category [^115q1LZc]. While it does not remove the entire epidermis like traditional ablative lasers, it creates microchannels through the epidermis [^11417esq] and delivers RF energy into the dermis, producing controlled coagulation and thermal injury [^115LWwb4]. This controlled injury is essential for stimulating collagen production and achieving significant clinical results [^114KfZyE].

---

## Clinical evidence and expert consensus

Clinical studies and expert consensus support classifying Morpheus8 as a **minimally ablative technology** [^114SuX5X]. A recent Aesthetic Surgery Journal publication reports that Morpheus8 creates a compact zone of ablation surrounded by expanded zones of necrotic and subnecrotic nonspecific heating, leading to significant skin tightening and improved skin quality. It also emphasizes that fractional RF treatment with Morpheus8 **spares the epidermis**, aside from the mechanical injury caused by the microneedles [^115LWwb4], making it significantly safer for darker skin types. This safety profile, combined with its efficacy, has made Morpheus8 a popular choice for treating acne scars, skin laxity, and other dermatological conditions [^115mGZU6] [^113eoe84].

---

## Comparison with other non-ablative technologies

Compared with other non-ablative technologies, Morpheus8 offers **several advantages**:

- **Deeper penetration**: Morpheus8 can penetrate deeper into the dermis (up to 4 mm), allowing for more significant collagen remodeling and skin tightening [^116RQmWm].

- **Customizable treatments**: Adjustable depth and energy settings enable personalized treatments based on individual patient needs [^114SuX5X] [^115LWwb4].

- **Minimal downtime**: Although minimally ablative, Morpheus8 typically results in minimal downtime, with most patients experiencing only mild redness and swelling for a few days [^113eoe84].

- **Safety**: Morpheus8 is considered safe for all skin types, including darker skin tones, due to its controlled thermal injury and minimal epidermal disruption [^114SuX5X] [^111XtoEE].

---

## Clinical outcomes and patient satisfaction

Clinical studies have demonstrated **significant improvements** in skin texture, firmness, and overall appearance following Morpheus8 treatments [^114KHGUv]. Patients typically require multiple sessions (usually 2–3) spaced 4–6 weeks apart to achieve optimal results [^113eoe84]. Patient satisfaction rates are high, with many reporting noticeable improvements in skin quality and reduced acne scarring [^114SuX5X].

---

## Potential risks and side effects

Although Morpheus8 is generally safe, **potential risks and side effects** include [^113eoe84]:

- Mild redness and swelling
- Temporary bruising
- Pinpoint bleeding
- Rare cases of hyperpigmentation or hypopigmentation
- Infection (rare)

Proper **patient selection**, pre-treatment counseling, and adherence to post-treatment care guidelines are essential to minimize these risks [^114KfZyE].

---

## Conclusion

Morpheus8 is not strictly non-ablative; it is a **minimally ablative** technology that combines microneedling with radiofrequency energy to create controlled thermal injury in the dermis [^114SuX5X]. This controlled injury stimulates collagen production [^114KfZyE] and remodels the skin, resulting in significant clinical improvements with minimal downtime [^1141YsiG]. Morpheus8 is considered safe and effective for all skin types [^113eoe84], making it a popular choice for treating acne scars, skin laxity, and other dermatological conditions.

### Radiofrequency microneedling: A comprehensive and critical review [^113eoe84]. Dermatologic Surgery (2021). High credibility.

Many studies have evaluated radiofrequency microneedling (RFMN) in various dermatologic conditions. However, the efficacy and safety of RFMN, and how it compares with other energy-based devices in a clinician's armamentarium, remain unclear.

- **Objective**: To review higher-quality evidence supporting RFMN and the dermatologic conditions which it can be used in.

- **Materials and methods**: A search was conducted in MEDLINE and EMBASE from inception to May 13, 2020, using the terms: "radiofrequency microneedling", "fractional radiofrequency", "radiofrequency needling", or "radiofrequency percutaneous collagen induction". Only randomized, split-body, or blinded studies with original data on humans were included. Non-English or non-dermatology-related studies were excluded.

- **Results**: Forty-two higher-quality studies were included after applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria. There were 14 studies for skin rejuvenation, 7 for acne scars, 6 for acne vulgaris, 5 each for striae and axillary hyperhidrosis, 2 for melasma, and 1 each for rosacea, cellulite, as well as androgenetic alopecia.

- **Conclusion**: Radiofrequency microneedling is an effective intervention that can be used repeatedly and safely in combination with other treatment modalities and in individuals with darker skin phototypes. Radiofrequency microneedling-induced dermal remodeling and neocollagenesis are slow and progressive but continue to improve even 6 months after treatment.

### In vivo histological evaluation of non-insulated microneedle radiofrequency applicator with novel fractionated pulse mode [^116mibjq]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Microneedle radiofrequency is a novel method that allows non-thermal penetration of the epidermis followed by RF coagulation at selected depths of the dermis surrounded by zones of non-coagulative volumetric heating. The first generation of microneedle RF applicators used insulated needles. These treatments were limited by several factors, including low volume of dermal heating, lack of effect in the papillary dermis, and pinpoint bleeding during the treatment. The system tested in this study (EndyMed PRO, Intensif applicator, EndyMed Medical, Cesarea, Israel) utilizes special extra sharp tapered non-insulated microneedles and a special pulse mode, allowing full coagulation during treatment and a higher effective volume of dermal heat.

- **Methods**: After Ethics Committee approval, one female pig (Type Large White X Landrace, 34 kg) was chosen for the study. The animal was anesthetized using Ketamine, Xylazine, and Isoflurane. The EndyMed PRO, Intensif applicator was used for treatment with different needle depth penetration (1 mm-3.5 mm) and in multiple energy settings. Six mm punch biopsies were harvested for histological analysis at the following time points: immediately after the treatment, 4 days after the treatment, and 14 days after the treatment. H&E and Masson-Trichrome stains were processed.

- **Results**: Visual inspection of the treated skin, immediately after the treatment, revealed arrays of pinpoint erythematous papules surrounded by undamaged epidermal tissue. The treatment field showed no sign of bleeding. Mild to moderate erythema and edema developed a few minutes after the procedure.

### Adjustable depth fractional radiofrequency combined with bipolar radiofrequency: A minimally invasive combination treatment for skin laxity [^115LWwb4]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2019). Low credibility.

The Morpheus8 (InMode Aesthetic Solutions) is a fractional RF device with programmable penetration depth and energy delivery. The 24 coated needles penetrate into the subdermal tissue, leading to coagulation of fat as well as contraction of the reticular dermis and surrounding connective tissue. At the same time, directional RF energy stimulates neocollagenesis, elastogenesis, and angiogenesis. The adjustable penetration depth and energy settings allow the clinician to customize treatment. In the face, treatment may be 1 to 2 mm, whereas for body areas, a 3-mm to 4-mm depth penetration would be appropriate. There is an additional 1-mm zone of heat effect that should be accounted for when planning treatment.

- **Treatment procedure**: A detailed history and physical examination are conducted to determine if there are any contraindications to treatment, such as collagen disorders, active infection, immunocompromised state, pregnancy, poor wound healing, and unrealistic expectations. Valcyclovir is recommended for patients with a history of herpes simplex.

- **Anesthesia**: Numerous anesthesia options are available depending on the energy employed, depth of treatment, and patient tolerance. Topical anesthesia applied for 45 to 60 minutes can be utilized if the energy is limited and tolerated by the patient. Some patients require nerve blocks or local anesthesia for higher energy settings.

### Mexametric and cutometric assessment of the signs of aging of the skin area around the eyes after the use of non-ablative fractional laser, non-ablative radiofrequency and intense pulsed light [^113DBPrE]. Dermatologic Therapy (2017). Low credibility.

The assessment of the signs of aging within the eye area involved cutometric (skin elasticity) and mexametric (discoloration and severity of erythema) examinations after treatment with non-ablative fractional laser, non-ablative radiofrequency (RF), and intense pulsed light (IPL). This study included 71 patients, aged 33–63 years, with an average age of 45.81 years, and Fitzpatrick skin types II and III.

- **Treatment sessions**:
	- 24 patients received 5 successive treatment sessions with a 1,410-nm non-ablative fractional laser at two-week intervals.
	- 23 patients received 5 successive treatment sessions with a non-ablative RF at one-week intervals.
	- 24 patients received 5 successive treatment sessions with an IPL at two-week intervals.

The treatment targeted the skin in the eye area. The Cutometer and Mexameter (Courage+Khazaka electronic) reference tests were used as objective methods for assessing skin properties: elasticity, skin pigmentation, and erythema. Measurements of skin elasticity were conducted at three or four sites within the eye area.

The results of cutometric measurements for R7 showed improvement in skin elasticity for all treatment methods. The largest statistically significant improvement (p < 0.0001) was observed with laser and RF treatment, particularly at sites on the upper and lower eyelid. The smallest change in skin elasticity for the laser, RF, and IPL — p = .017, p = .003, and p = .001, respectively — was observed at a site within the outer corner of the eye. In all measurement sites and for all methods, the greatest improvement in skin elasticity was observed.

### Ablative CO2 lasers for skin tightening: Traditional versus fractional [^113s2zs5]. Dermatologic Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

With patients being more resistant to invasive treatments and those that result in significant downtime, there has been a rise in using lasers to improve skin laxity and induce tissue tightening as an alternative to surgery. Traditional and fractional ablative resurfacing induce skin tightening through precise dermal heating and a wound-healing effect.

- **Objective**: The purpose of this review was to discuss the mechanism of action of using ablative lasers to induce skin tightening and compare traditional versus fractional technologies.

- **Materials and methods**: A review of the literature was performed.

- **Results**: The authors discuss traditional and fractional ablative lasers for achieving skin tightening.

- **Conclusion**: Neocollagenesis and dermal remodeling seen after ablative resurfacing contribute to the clinical improvement observed in tissue tightening. Fractional photothermolysis may enhance the tissue tightening effects of ablative lasers due to its ability to ablate deeper into the reticular dermis without significant risk for scarring.

### Fractional carbon dioxide laser resurfacing of skin grafts: long-term results of a prospective, randomized, split-scar, evaluator-blinded study [^1158njVz]. Lasers in Surgery and Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Fractional ablative resurfacing is frequently used for treating atrophic and acne scars and for the early improvement of scars after surgery. However, no evidence-based clinical data have been available on improving the appearance of skin grafts through fractional CO2 laser resurfacing.

- **Objectives**: The primary outcome parameter was the adaptation of the skin graft to the surrounding skin at 2, 6, and 12 months after the second laser treatment. Secondary outcome parameters included melanin variation, skin roughness, resizing of the skin graft, and patient satisfaction with cosmetic results.

- **Methods**: The randomized portion of the skin graft was treated with the fractional CO2 laser twice, at a 4-week interval. The first laser treatment was conducted 3–8 weeks post-surgery. Two independent dermatologists assessed the adaptation of the treated and untreated portions of the skin graft to the surrounding skin using follow-up pictures and an 11-point scale (0 representing no adaptation and 10 complete adaptation).

- **Results**: Adaptation to the surrounding skin improved significantly after laser therapy. The mean investigator ratings showed poor adaptation before the first treatment (treatment: 2.24 ± 1.00; control group: 1.95 ± 1.27; p < 0.001; n = 26) but significant improvement at the follow-up visits (8 weeks: treatment: 6.38 ± 1.47; control group: 5.29 ± 1.27; p < 0.001; 6 months: treatment: 7.31 ± 1.24; control group: 6.04 ± 0.91; 12 months: treatment: 7.6 ± 1.26; control group: 6.57 ± 1.02; n = 26). After fractional ablative laser treatment, adaptation to the surrounding skin was significantly enhanced.

### One-year follow-up of acne vulgaris patients treated with nonablative monopolar radiofrequency: Efficacy and safety assessment [^116eHceB]. Lasers in Surgery and Medicine (2025). High credibility.

For noninflammatory lesions (Figures 1, 2, 3), the mean count of comedones at baseline was 31 (IQR: 16–39). By the 6-month follow-up, this count decreased to 28 (IQR: 18–32, p = 0.474), reflecting an 11% reduction. At the 9-month follow-up, the count dropped to 11 (IQR: 6–19, p < 0.001), representing a 59% reduction from baseline (p = 0.0002), and further decreased to 10 (IQR: 4–14, p < 0.001) at 1 year. This reflects a 62% reduction from baseline, both of which were statistically significant.

At 9 months following the second treatment (Figure 4), sebum excretion decreased significantly to 31.74 ± 18.52, representing a 43.5% reduction from baseline (p = 0.0004). However, at the 1-year follow-up, sebum output increased slightly to 39.61 ± 22.32, corresponding to a 29.4% reduction from baseline. This change, however, was not statistically significant (p = 0.4741).

Sebum output was measured by Sebumeter. *Statistically significant reductions in sebum excretion compared with baseline. M, month; Tx, treatment.

The percentage reduction in pore area from baseline remained notable, with decreases of 15.9% (p = 0.304) and 6.7% (p = 0.116) observed at 9 and 12 months, respectively, following the second treatment.

Patient assessments, including perceived skin oiliness and improvement ratings, demonstrated significant changes over time. At baseline, the mean score for perceived facial oiliness was 10.00 (SD = 0.00). By the 6-month follow-up, the mean oiliness score decreased to 3.90 ± 2.49, reflecting a 61.00% reduction (p < 0.0001). At the 9-month follow-up, this score further decreased.

### Safety and efficacy evaluation of pulsed dye laser treatment, CO ablative fractional resurfacing, and combined treatment for surgical scar clearance [^11297GRA]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Surgical scars are an unwanted sequela following surgical procedures. Several different treatment modalities and approaches are currently being employed to improve the cosmesis of surgical scars, each having varying degrees of success. The objective of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of pulsed dye laser treatment, CO2 ablative fractional resurfacing, and a combined treatment with these two modalities for the cosmetic improvement of surgical scarring that occurred following the surgical removal of skin cancer from different anatomic areas.

- **Materials and methods**: Twenty-five patients with surgical scarring, most frequently on the face following recent surgical excision of skin cancer with Mohs surgery, were included in this multicenter, prospective clinical study. Patients were randomized into four treatment arms: pulsed dye laser alone, CO2 laser alone, a combined treatment with these two modalities, and CO2 ablative fractional resurfacing on the same day of surgery to half of the scar, followed by a combined treatment with the two modalities to that half of the scar. Patients in each study arm received a total of 3–4 treatments, while those in Arm 4 underwent an additional treatment with CO2 laser immediately after surgery. Patients were followed up at 1 and 3 months after the final treatment session.

- **Results**: No adverse events were seen. Significant improvements in the appearance of scars were achieved in all study arms, as assessed by the Vancouver Scar Scale and Global Evaluation Response scales, with the best clinical outcomes observed.

### Novel use of non-ablative fractional photothermolysis for café-au-lait macules in darker skin types [^114zdJX8]. Lasers in Surgery and Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

The removal of café-au-lait macules (CALMs) in patients with darker skin phototypes poses a significant challenge due to limited available therapeutic options and increased risk of adverse effects, including permanent scarring and further dyspigmentation. Herein, we demonstrate the novel use of non-ablative fractional photothermolysis for the safe removal of CALMs in individuals with Fitzpatrick skin type (FST) IV-V.

Retrospective analysis of four patients (FST IV-V) with CALMs revealed that three of these patients had greater than 50% clearance after multiple treatment sessions with the non-ablative fractional 1,550-nm erbium-doped fiber laser.

This report demonstrates the utility and safety of non-ablative fractional resurfacing in the treatment of CALMs in darker skin phototypes.

### Targeting inflammation in acne: Current treatments and future prospects [^113ECZmJ]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2023). High credibility.

Non-ablative fractionated radiofrequency microneedling (FRFM) is useful in treating active acne and scarring. Combining FRFM with isotretinoin is particularly effective in treating inflammatory acne and reducing scarring. In fact, combinations of isotretinoin with other energy-based devices, including PDL and ablative fractional lasers, are effective treatments for active inflammatory acne as well. Lastly, microneedling devices may be implemented in the transdermal delivery of topical retinoids and salicylic acid, as well as for improving scarring.

### Hypertrophic scarring of the neck following ablative fractional carbon dioxide laser resurfacing [^116BbooT]. Lasers in Surgery and Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Ablative fractional carbon dioxide (CO(2)) laser treatments have gained popularity due to their efficacy, shortened downtime, and decreased potential for scarring in comparison to traditional ablative CO(2) resurfacing. At the time of writing, scarring with fractional CO(2) lasers had not been reported.

- **Objective**: Five patients treated with the same fractional CO(2) laser technology for photodamage of the neck were referred to our practices 1–3 months after treatment. Each patient developed scarring. Of the five cases, two are discussed in detail. The first was treated under general anesthesia on the face and anterior neck at a pulse energy of 30 mJ (859 microm depth) with 25% coverage. Eleven days after treatment, three non-healing areas along the horizontal skin folds of the anterior neck were noted. At 2 weeks after CO(2) ablative fractional resurfacing, these areas had become thickened. These raised areas were treated with a non-ablative fractionated 1,550 nm laser to modify the wound healing milieu. One week later, distinct firm pale papules in linear arrays with mild hypopigmentation had developed along involved neck skin folds. A skin biopsy was performed.

	- For the second patient, the neck was treated at a pulse energy of 20 mJ (630 microm depth) with 30% coverage of the exposed skin, with a total treatment energy of 5.0 kJ. Minimal crusting was noted on the neck throughout the initial healing phase of 2 weeks. She then experienced tightness on her neck. Approximately 3 weeks after treatment, she developed multiple vertical and horizontal hypertrophic scars (HS).

### One-year follow-up of acne vulgaris patients treated with nonablative monopolar radiofrequency: Efficacy and safety assessment [^116Lhn21]. Lasers in Surgery and Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

Patients reported their perceived improvement in skin appearance using a 10-point scale. By the 6-month follow-up, the mean improvement scores increased to 6.10 ± 2.49, showing significant improvement from baseline (p < 0.0001). By the 9-month follow-up, the mean improvement scores further increased to 6.53 ± 2.90, showing significant improvement (p < 0.0001). At the 1-year follow-up, the score was 5.91 ± 3.24, maintaining substantial improvement compared to baseline (p = 0.0003).

The DLQI scores of the study participants remained significantly improved from baseline at both 9 and 12 months following the second treatment, with median scores of 2.00 (IQR: 1.00–3.75, p < 0.0001) and 2.00 (IQR: 0.25–3.00, p < 0.0001), respectively, reflecting an 80% change from baseline.

- **Adverse effects**: No adverse effects, including skin dryness, dyspigmentation, textural changes, or surface irregularities, were observed at the 9- and 12-month follow-up visits.

### Improvement of burn scars treated with fractional ablative CO2 lasers-a systematic review and meta-analysis using the Vancouver Scar Scale [^1154jWci]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2021). Low credibility.

The fractional ablative CO2 laser is increasingly being used to treat burn scars; however, objective measures of outcome success vary widely. This systematic review and meta-analysis extract and pool available data to assess the outcomes of patients with burn scars treated with fractional ablative CO2 laser. A search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the gray literature was performed. The review included studies that reported patients with a confirmed diagnosis of scarring as a result of a burn injury, who were treated with fractional ablative CO2 laser and whose progress was recorded using the Vancouver Scar Scale (VSS).

Eight studies were included in the systematic review and meta-analysis. Treatment regimens varied amongst studies, as did patient outcomes. Pooled data revealed an average VSS improvement of 29% across 282 patients following fractional CO2 ablative laser treatment. Although the heterogeneity of treatment regimens across studies limits this systematic review's ability to provide specific treatment recommendations, the overall trend towards improvement of burn scars treated with fractional CO2 laser based on the VSS encourages further exploration of this modality as a therapeutic tool.

### Fractional technology: A review and clinical approaches [^111R3Piw]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

All of the FT devices available to me work very well. Some may not be "true" FT devices and may be creating "holes" in the skin, but clinically, the results seen with these devices have brought us quite close to achieving the gold standard of ablative resurfacing. In the future, we may find FT will resurface the market of ablative resurfacing.

### Sequential facial skin rejuvenation with intense pulsed light and non-ablative fractionated laser resurfacing in Fitzpatrick skin type II-IV patients: A prospective multicenter analysis [^112oAHcg]. Lasers in Surgery and Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Friedmann et al. proposed the use of intense pulsed light (IPL), micro-focused ultrasound (MFUS), and a volumizing filler to simultaneously address superficial cutaneous irregularities, skin laxity, and deep-tissue volume loss. In a prospective, split-face, five-series analysis of the impact of IPL, near-infrared pulsed light, and fractional laser combination therapy applied for skin rejuvenation in 113 Asian patients, Tao et al. described a dramatic effect of combined therapy at the 1- and 3-month follow-up visits; safety levels were similar when compared to patients who received monotherapy. Trelles et al. reported enhanced epidermal thickening, collagen organization, and improved patient satisfaction following combined IPL and ablative Er:YAG laser therapy versus IPL monotherapy. While comparative studies are still lacking, combined treatment regimens seem to augment and potentiate the effect of each individual modality.

Despite extensive literature regarding the safety and efficacy of minimally invasive photorejuvenation modalities, few published reports are available regarding their combined use. This study aimed to explore the safety and synergistic potential of sequential IPL and non-ablative fractionated laser (NAFL) treatments with particular focus on skin texture, skin tone, and mean downtime.

### Sublative rejuvenation: Experience with a new fractional radiofrequency system for skin rejuvenation and repair [^115q1LZc]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Several laser-based ablative resurfacing and non-ablative rejuvenation technologies offer non-surgical options for improving the appearance of the skin. Although efficacy and good safety profiles have been demonstrated, limitations do exist with these systems. A more recent technology has been developed that employs fractionated bipolar radiofrequency (RF) energy. Referred to as "sublative rejuvenation", the treatment improves skin appearance while addressing some of the limitations of both ablative resurfacing and non-ablative skin rejuvenation. This article describes the technology and reports on the authors' experience with it in clinical practice. Unlike fractional ablative laser treatments, which can disrupt 10–70% of the epidermis and where most of the effect is in the epidermis, the sublative rejuvenation technique impacts only up to 5% of the epidermis and most of the effect is in the dermis. As a result, healing is rapid and downtime is minimal. The treatment is appropriate for all skin types and is an effective alternative for patients with darker skin who may be at risk for hyperpigmentation from laser treatments.

### Novel use of erbium:YAG (2,940-nm) laser for fractional ablative photothermolysis in the treatment of photodamaged facial skin: a pilot study [^115ABw5v]. Dermatologic Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Use of CO2 or conventional erbium laser ablation, as well as more recent nonablative laser photothermolysis for skin rejuvenation, is associated with significant disadvantages.

- **Objective**: The objective was to assess the efficacy of the erbium:YAG laser (2,940 nm) using the "ablative" fractional resurfacing mode to improve photodamaged skin.

- **Methods**: A total of 28 patients, 27 women and 1 man, aged 28 to 72 years (mean age, 54.2 years), with Fitzpatrick Skin Types II to IV, were treated for mild to moderate actinic damage using fractional erbium:YAG laser (2,940 nm) combined with Pixel technology. Sessions were scheduled at 4-week intervals. Response to treatment was evaluated by two physicians on a five-tiered scale.

- **Results**: Patients underwent one to four treatment sessions (mean, 3.2). The initial reaction consisted of erythema and minimal swelling. On clinical assessment 2 months after the final treatment, the results were rated excellent by 21 patients (75%) and good by 7 (25%). Nineteen of the 21 were also evaluated 6 to 9 months after the final treatment without any significant change in the results.

- **Conclusions**: Fractional ablative photothermolysis using erbium:YAG laser (2,940 nm) is a promising option for skin resurfacing with reduced risk and downtime compared to existing laser methods.

### Adjustable depth fractional radiofrequency combined with bipolar radiofrequency: A minimally invasive combination treatment for skin laxity [^114sEE91]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2019). Low credibility.

Increasingly, patients are seeking minimally invasive methods to tighten skin and remodel adipose tissue. A large treatment gap exists among three types of patients: (1) the younger demographic, who increasingly desire soft tissue tightening without traditional operations, scars, and downtime; (2) patients with soft tissue laxity who are not "severe enough" to justify an excisional procedure, but not "mild enough" to rely on liposuction with soft tissue contraction alone; and (3) those with re-laxity who already underwent traditional excisional procedures. In these populations, plastic surgeons risk under- or overtreating with traditional methods.

The purpose of this supplement is to describe the utility of radiofrequency (RF) microneedling (Fractora modified to Morpheus8, InMode Aesthetic Solutions, Lake Forest, CA) in combination with bipolar RF (FaceTite/BodyTite, InMode Aesthetic Solutions). By combining these procedures, the aforementioned treatment gap can be addressed. The RF microneedling allows for subdermal adipose remodeling and skin tightening. The addition of bipolar RF also tightens the skin by contraction of the underlying fibroseptal network in addition to the induction of neocollagenesis, elastogenesis, and angiogenesis at skin surface temperatures of 40° to 50°C. In our experience, these technologies have been effective and safe in these patient populations.

### The role of fractional radiofrequency in long-term acne remission and reduction of acne scar load [^115jPj4C]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2025). Low credibility.

Acne is an inflammatory skin disease affecting the majority of the world's population at some point in their lifetime and is chronic in about 50% of cases. It can lead to significant social withdrawal, depression, and disfiguring scars. Available treatments often have high relapse rates, dangerous side effects, and carry a social stigma, leading to poor patient compliance and treatment failure.

The aim of this article was to discuss and share the authors' experiences using fractional radiofrequency (RF) (Morpheus8; InMode Ltd, Lake Forest, CA) in the treatment of both active acne and acne scars. A retrospective review was conducted comparing three treatment modalities. In total, 356 patients received acne scar treatments. The cohort comprised a high-dose isotretinoin topical therapy series (n = 128, 36%), a six-session ablative laser series (n = 89, 25%), and a three-session fractional RF microneedling series (n = 139, 44).

Of the patients with an extended 3-year follow-up, the relapse rates were as follows: isotretinoin group, 36 of 54 (67%); laser group, 12 of 16 (75%); and fractional RF microneedling group, 7 of 29 (24%).

Fractional RF microneedling technology has proven to be an effective tool in treating older acne scars, tightening skin, and filling in atrophic scars when used alongside other techniques. It is highly effective and safe for treating all skin types with acne and acne scars.

### CIRSE standards of practice on thermal ablation of bone tumours [^116F3YMQ]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2022). Low credibility.

- **Modality-specific recommendations, including device selection**: RFA probes are metallic needles with exposed cutting (active) tips of varying and adjustable length with an insulated shaft. Straight probes are used for small discrete targets such as the nidus of an OO, and expandable/multi-clustered (umbrella-configuration) devices are used in the treatment of lesions where a larger ablation volume is required. RFA probes may be monopolar (requiring grounding pads) or bipolar (grounding pads unnecessary).

Specifically for spinal metastases, bipolar radiofrequency electrodes (articulating or straight) are available with thermocouples (incorporated or separate) that can easily combine tissue protection, ablation, and vertebral augmentation in a single treatment.

MWA is performed with a water-cooled interstitial antenna. No grounding pads are required, and there is no interference with implanted electrical devices such as pacemakers. MWA energy profiles are based on the manufacturer's recommended combination of power level (i.e. wattage) and exposure time (i.e. minutes) needed to obtain the desired size of the ablation area. For larger lesions, MWA can be performed with multiple applicators to achieve overlapping ablation zones. For superficial OO, it is not necessary to penetrate the cortical bone, as if the applicator tip is positioned directly over the lesion, the intense heat will penetrate the cortex and effect ablation. In cases of cortical interruption over or adjacent to the lesion, the probe can be positioned directly into the lesion.

### British Thoracic Society guidelines for the investigation and management of pulmonary nodules [^111oy1x6]. Thorax (2015). High credibility.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for pulmonary nodules, specifically with respect to radiotherapy and radiofrequency ablation, the BTS 2015 guidelines recommend considering conventional radical radiotherapy. This is advised for patients who are unsuitable for stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy or radiofrequency ablation, particularly those unfit for surgery with a high probability of malignancy where biopsy is nondiagnostic or not possible.

### The efficacy of fractional ablative carbon dioxide laser combined with other therapies in acne scars [^11425iNb]. Dermatologic Therapy (2019). High credibility.

Fractional ablative carbon dioxide laser resurfacing is a frontline treatment for acne scars. It creates multiple microscopic treatment zones to accelerate collagen formation and the healing process of reepithelialization, according to the principle of fractional photothermolysis. Currently, the fractional CO2 laser with a wavelength of 10,600 nm is commonly used in the field of cosmetology and clinical therapies for various skin diseases, effectively improving skin regeneration and scar formation. To achieve satisfactory results for patients with scars, repetitive fractional laser therapy is often required. However, this treatment may lead to complications such as erythema, edema, infection, and post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation. Additionally, different types of acne scars may respond differently to laser treatment, further limiting its widespread use. Recent studies, both domestically and internationally, recommend a new pattern of fractional laser combined with other therapies to improve acne scars, ensuring the safety and effectiveness of treatment. This article reviews recent pertinent literature and summarizes the progression of ablative fractional CO2 laser combined with other therapies on acne scars.

### The role of fractional radiofrequency in long-term acne remission and reduction of acne scar load [^114KjfLS]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2025). High credibility.

Acne is an inflammatory skin disease afflicting the majority of the world's population at some point in their lifetime, and is seen to be chronic in about 50% of cases. It leads to significant social withdrawal, depression, and disfiguring scars in many cases. Available treatments are characterized by high rates of relapse, dangerous side effects, and social stigma, which often lead to poor patient compliance and treatment failure.

- **Objectives**: The aim of this article was to discuss and share the authors' experiences utilizing fractional radiofrequency (RF) (Morpheus8; InMode Ltd, Lake Forest, CA) in the treatment of both active acne and acne scars.

- **Methods**: A retrospective review was conducted comparing three treatment modalities. In total, 356 patients received acne scar treatments. The cohort comprised a high-dose isotretinoin topical therapy series (n = 128, 36%), a six-session ablative laser series (n = 89, 25%), and a three-session fractional RF microneedling series (n = 139, 44%).

- **Results**: Of the patients with extended three-year follow-up, the relapse rates were: isotretinoin group, 36 of 54 (67%); laser group, 12 of 16 (75%); and fractional RF microneedling group, 7 of 29 (24%).

- **Conclusions**: In treating older acne scars, fractional RF microneedling technology has served as an effective tool to tighten skin and fill in atrophic scars when used in conjunction with other techniques. This technology is very effective and very safe for treating all skin types with acne and acne scars.

### Hypertrichotic Becker's nevi treated with combination 1,550 nm non-ablative fractional photothermolysis and laser hair removal [^116BwZD2]. Lasers in Surgery and Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

The removal of Becker's nevi poses a significant challenge due to limited available therapeutic options and increased risk of adverse effects, including scarring and dyspigmentation. Herein, we present the use of the non-ablative fractional photothermolysis in combination with laser hair removal for the treatment of hypertrichotic Becker's nevi.

- **Method**: Retrospective analysis of three patients with Becker's nevi revealed that two patients with hypertrichotic Becker's nevi had greater than 75% clearance with combination therapy, and one patient with atrichotic Becker's nevus had a similar result with monotherapy non-ablative fractional photothermolysis.

- **Conclusion**: This report demonstrates the utility and safety of combination non-ablative fractional resurfacing and laser hair removal for the treatment of hypertrichotic Becker's nevi, and monotherapy non-ablative fractional photothermolysis for atrichotic Becker's nevi. Further comparative studies are necessary to determine optimal laser parameters, treatment schedules, and response duration.

### Multimodal management of atrophic acne scarring in the aging face [^114EX6g7]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Fractional photothermolysis is a further innovation in resurfacing techniques that was developed in response to the safety concerns of full ablative therapies and the modest efficacy results demonstrated for the nonablative therapies discussed above. This technique is based on the creation of spatially precise microscopic thermal zones (MTZs) at depths of 200–500 μm and spaced at 200–300 μm intervals, leaving surrounding tissue intact. It was first described using a 1550-nm erbium fiber laser (Fraxel ®, Solta Medical Inc. Hayward, CA), although other fractional laser devices are now available.

This method differs from other resurfacing techniques in that damaged epidermal components are extruded by viable keratinocytes at the lateral margins of the MTZs and exfoliated after several days (lending the skin a bronzed appearance). Epidermal tissue that is spared between thermal zones contains viable cells capable of rapid reepithelialization, and the stratum corneum remains intact immediately after treatment due to its low water content. The gradual exfoliation of the epidermis following fractional resurfacing also results in improved superficial dyspigmentation.

This technique generally requires a series of three to six treatments at 2–4 week intervals for best clinical improvement, which can achieve results for atrophic scars similar to that of traditional ablative laser skin resurfacing. In contrast to ablative techniques, adverse effects are typically mild and transient, including erythema, periocular edema, and a slight bronzing of the skin.

### Efficacy and safety of a carbon-dioxide ablative fractional resurfacing device for treatment of atrophic acne scars in Asians [^111NyKiJ]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

The treatment of atrophic scars with a fractional laser resurfacing technique has demonstrated favorable outcomes, although data on the efficacy and adverse effects of this procedure in persons with dark-skinned phototypes are limited.

- **Objective**: This study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of carbon-dioxide ablative fractional resurfacing on atrophic acne scars in Asian individuals.

- **Methods**: Thirteen subjects (8 female and 5 male, aged 25–52 years) with skin phototype IV and atrophic acne scars were treated with 3 sessions of carbon-dioxide ablative fractional resurfacing laser, at an average of 7-week intervals. Objective (ultraviolet A-light video camera) and subjective (clinical evaluation by two blinded dermatologists) assessments were obtained at baseline and at 1, 3, and 6 months after the final treatment.

- **Results**: At the 6-month follow-up, 85% of the subjects were rated as having at least 25% to 50% improvement of scars. Improvement significantly progressed from the 1-month follow-up to the 6-month follow-up (P = 0.002). At 1 month after 3 treatments, surface smoothness (P = 0.03) and scar volume (P < .001) significantly improved compared with baseline measurements. Of the subjects, 62% rated themselves as having at least 50% improvement in their scars. Mild post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation was the most common adverse effect observed in 92% of the subjects or 51% of treatment sessions, and was completely resolved in an average of 5 weeks.

- **Limitation**: The small sample size was a study limitation.

- **Conclusions**: The study found carbon-dioxide ablative fractional resurfacing to be effective in improving atrophic acne scars in Asian individuals.

### Is post-ablation neo-squamous epithelium genomically predisposed to malignant progression [^114nNwBw]. BMJ Oncology (2023). Low credibility.

These findings should be of reassurance to clinicians and may provide useful guidance to researchers. If there is little genomically that predisposes the tissue to malignancy, efforts can continue in understanding and potentially addressing the non-genomic functional defects associated with post-ablation tissue.

This study also highlights a few interesting technical lessons. First, it is notable that these low allele fraction mutations were detectable using standard sequencing techniques. This may encourage more researchers to investigate the prevalence of these mutations in normal tissues. It should also serve as a warning about the interpretation of low allele fraction driver mutations in cancers, as they could be picked up from contamination from surrounding normal tissues that harbor inconsequential mutations as a result of ageing.

The authors recognize that the sequencing approach taken does not preclude there being other mutations present in the tissue, either at even lower allele fractions in the sequenced sample or in part of the tissue that was not biopsied. However, this does not detract from the conclusion against the main hypothesis, of no evidence of large clonal expansions.

Finally, the sample size in this study (18 neo-squamous samples) is admittedly small, which prohibits the authors from concluding whether TP53 mutations are increased in neo-squamous compared to normal epithelium. This is unfortunate, given the importance of TP53 mutations in malignant progression, but one can empathize with the challenges of sample availability and justification.

### An anatomical approach to radiofrequency-assisted facial rejuvenation: Beyond the treatment gap [^1169d9Vm]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2025). Low credibility.

Radiofrequency-assisted facial rejuvenation has evolved tremendously over the last four years of our practice. We have transitioned from a proof-of-concept model to the identification and successful management of "treatment gap" patients, and now to performing bipolar RF and fractional bipolar microneedling RF beyond the treatment gap population. It has become a key adjunct to a facelift, replacing traditional adjuncts such as lasers, chemical peels, and dermabrasion. Morpheus8 of the upper lip and/or perioral area is fairly standard during facelift surgery. We also apply the Morpheus8 on elevated skin flaps over the neck, mandibular border, and nasolabial folds; however, we refrain from this on elevated skin flaps of the immediate preauricular area, where the skin is thin.

Although surgical excision remains the gold standard for the treatment of moderate to severe facial skin laxity, we have found that the proportion of patients seeking a less invasive procedure with quicker recovery is increasing. A younger demographic is spending more time in the public eye with social media and has a desire for improvement in facial and neck appearance. Many patients present knowing that minimally invasive RF technology can give them an improvement in their specific areas of concern, and they seek physicians with experience in performing these procedures. The terms FaceTite, AccuTite, and Morpheus8 (all products of InMode) are now common in the public vernacular. Due to global marketing efforts, patients will often call the office specifically requesting these procedures.

### Body contouring finesse: Dynamic definition liposculpture and bipolar radiofrequency microneedling [^116im6PP]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2025). Low credibility.

Intraoperative photographs depict the use of the Morpheus8 microneedling radiofrequency device after the completion of liposuction in a 29-year-old female patient. The procedure began over zones with more noticeable flaccidity, typically including the proximal posterior arm, lower abdomen, top lateral posterior torso, medial thigh, and infragluteal region. The focus then shifted to the negative spaces and muscle limits to highlight transition muscle zones. Avoidance of RF energy delivery was crucial over muscles where fat transfer had been performed. We intentionally left spaces between shots to facilitate subsequent application with varied depth or energy levels. These settings were adjusted based on the patient's skin quality and subdermal thickness. Common reference settings included:

- **Arms and thighs**: 30W to 35W power, starting at 6 mm depth down to 4 mm and 2 mm.
- **Torso**: Burst mode at 40W power, starting at 7 mm depth, then 5 mm and 3 mm.
- **Submandibular region**: 50W, 40W, and 30W at depths of 4 mm, 3 mm, and 2 mm.

Intraoperative photographs further illustrate the procedure in the flanks and abdomen, highlighting the "grid" pattern expected post microneedling RF treatment.

Photographic integrity

Plastic surgeons and patients rely heavily on photographs. Photographic integrity is therefore essential. A 2019 publication claimed to show the results of InMode BodyTite treatments in combination with RF microneedling using the Fractora (InMode) device, later replaced by the Morpheus8 device. The study included photographs of one patient who also underwent an undisclosed abdominoplasty (Fig. 4). In a set of facial photographs contained in the same article, the mandibular border was lightened to soften the appearance of jowls. A third patient appears to have had undisclosed liposuction of the back.

	- A, B, Pretreatment and 6-month posttreatment photographs of this 47-year-old woman have been matched for size and orientation. The authors report that this patient was treated with bipolar radiofrequency and radiofrequency microneedling treatment of the anterior abdomen. The postoperative photograph shows telltale signs of an abdominoplasty, with a conspicuous oblique scar on the right flank, a periumbilical scar, and downward displacement of pigmented skin lesions. Adapted from Dayan et al. and reprinted from Swanson.

A 2015 study determined that the percent change in linear measurements on the treated skin of the upper arms exceeded the percent change in area measurements, which is geometrically impossible. These patients also received liposuction, which can produce skin tightening on its own, without energy treatment (Fig. 5). Photographs of patients who were not actually in the study were published.

### Nonablative laser technology radiofrequency [^116oHePh]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2009). Low credibility.

According to the author, nonablative radiofrequency treatment will not replace standard surgical rhytidectomy, but it may play an important role in cosmetically improving early skin laxity. He describes a noninvasive skin tightening approach that uses volumetric heating of the entire dermis, protecting the epidermis from blistering with a cryogen-cooled contact probe.

### Combination ablative approach to laser therapy in advanced aging of the face [^114ZAztW]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Misperceptions have persisted regarding scanning full-field erbium laser that have caused it to be overshadowed by fractional ablative resurfacing. This can lead to sub-optimal treatment of the periocular and perioral skin. Our report describes the utility of a combined approach of fractional ablative CO2 with full-field erbium ablation for full-face rejuvenation. Each laser has a role in creating optimal outcomes for advanced photoaging in the fewest treatments.

- **Methods**: A patient with severe photodamage and etched-in lines underwent full-face fractional ablative CO2 (CO2RE, Syneron Candela) and full-field ablative perioral and periocular erbium laser (Contour TRL, Sciton Inc.). The pre-procedure consultations included evaluation of the severity of the photodamage and etched-in lines, as well as discussion of patient goals and appropriate treatment options. Photos of similar patients and post-treatment recovery were reviewed. Fully ablative lasers are generally avoided in Fitzpatrick skin type IV-VI. Prior to treatment, full-face nerve blocks and topical anesthesia were provided. Full facial fractional ablative CO2 laser was then applied in one orthogonal pass to the whole face. This was followed by treating the infraorbital and perioral skin with four passes of full-field erbium laser. Visualized residual lines were focally treated. Marked improvement was seen in a single treatment session.

- **Results**: Standardized digital imaging revealed dramatic improvement in skin texture and etched lines.

- **Conclusion**: For appropriately selected patients, combination ablative approaches can significantly enhance skin rejuvenation.

### Radiofrequency therapy and noncosmetic cutaneous conditions [^111XtoEE]. Dermatologic Surgery (2019). Low credibility.

The need for noninvasive methods in the treatment of cutaneous disease has continued to evolve exponentially. Amidst the search for technologies, radiofrequency (RF) has proven efficacious in numerous skin disease processes. Although RF is well known for its cosmetic utility, its mechanism is valued in the treatment of many noncosmetic cutaneous conditions of various etiologies.

- **Objective**: To identify and describe studies in which RF was used to treat noncosmetic skin conditions and to explore the potential of this modality for further application in dermatologic diseases.

- **Materials and methods**: The PubMed database was used to find relevant articles.

- **Results**: This search strategy yielded 54 articles that met the eligibility criteria. Noncosmetic indications discussed in these articles include varicose veins (n = 10,550), lymphangioma circumscriptum (n = 72), cutaneous neoplasms (n = 42), cutaneous leishmaniasis (n = 743), acne and acne scarring (n = 158), non-acne scarring (n = 43), primary axillary hyperhidrosis (n = 76), and acute and chronic wounds (n = 94).

- **Conclusion**: Treatment with RF is an effective, generally noninvasive modality with a relatively short postprocedure recovery time and little potential for severe adverse effects in the treatment of several cutaneous conditions. Further clinical studies would prove useful to assess the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of this treatment.

### In-vivo histological analysis of a fractional CO2 laser system intended for treatment of soft tissue [^115ajXhw]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Fractional ablative lasers have been shown to be safe and effective for improving wrinkles, scars, skin texture, and dyspigmentation. However, the exact effects of this technology in vivo on epidermal and dermal skin constituents have not been delineated. This study evaluated the in-vivo histological effects over time of treatment with a fractional ablative CO2 system, using different treatment parameters.

- **Materials and methods**: Healthy adult volunteers were enrolled in this multicenter clinical study. Study participants, previously scheduled for abdominoplasty, received fractional CO2 laser treatment on the abdomen at a predetermined time prior to surgery. Biopsies were taken at baseline and after CO2 treatment. Morphological and morphometric analyses were performed in the ablated and coagulated tissue areas.

- **Results**: Nine healthy adult volunteers were treated. Histologic evaluation showed 800–900 micron diameter zones of ablation and coagulation confined to the uppermost layer of the skin in the mode with the greatest fractional skin coverage using Light Mode 30–50% (spot diameter of 150 microns, 30–60 millijoules fluence), while ablation to levels of up to 900 microns in depth occurred using the Deep Mode (spot diameter 150 microns, 50–80 millijoules). Healing times of treated tissue varied from 1 day post-treatment with the Light Mode, and up to 10 days post-treatment with the Deep Mode. No remnants of ablation or coagulation were seen after 30 days post CO2 treatment with either mode. There were no adverse events associated with treatments.

- **Conclusion**: Treatment with fractional CO2 laser systems appears safe and effective, without significant adverse effects.

### Nonablative laser resurfacing: A systematic review of the literature [^112aGqQ3]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2002). Low credibility.

"Nonablative laser resurfacing" is a new treatment for photoaged skin, aimed at wounding the upper dermis to induce dermal fibrosis and improve the clinical appearance. Unlike conventional laser resurfacing or dermabrasion, the epidermis is protected and retained to avoid problems associated with open wounds and reepithelialization. A number of lasers and light sources have been developed or adapted for this purpose.

### Non-surgical ablation for breast cancer: An emerging therapeutic option [^112HD65a]. The Lancet Oncology (2024). High credibility.

Non-surgical ablation is emerging as an alternative local therapy option for patients with early-stage breast cancer, encompassing two main types of percutaneous therapeutic procedures: radiofrequency ablation and cryoablation. Both techniques involve the obliteration of a spherical lesion, and feasibility studies have shown that complete tumor ablation is achievable with good or excellent cosmetic results. Although few clinical studies have directly compared non-surgical ablation with conventional surgical resection, observational studies indicate that clinical outcomes are favorable with acceptable rates of local control and no detriment to long-term survival.

Outstanding issues with these percutaneous ablative techniques require resolution before they can be incorporated into routine clinical practice. Hence, a consensus meeting was convened to discuss the challenges of non-surgical ablation and clarify indications for its use alongside clinical management pathways. This policy review addresses some of the broader biological aspects of non-surgical ablation, including immune-modulatory effects and potential novel applications for the future.

### Fractional nonablative laser resurfacing: Is there a skin tightening effect [^117NUCA5]. Dermatologic Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Fractional photothermolysis, an approach to laser skin resurfacing, creates microscopic thermal wounds in the skin separated by islands of spared tissue. This method was developed to overcome the high incidence of adverse events and prolonged healing times associated with full coverage ablative laser procedures.

- **Objective**: To examine whether fractional nonablative laser resurfacing induces skin tightening.

- **Materials and methods**: A literature review was performed to evaluate the clinical and histologic effects of fractional nonablative laser resurfacing and full coverage ablative resurfacing procedures.

- **Results**: Fractional nonablative lasers produce excellent outcomes with minimal risk and morbidity for a variety of clinical conditions, including photodamaged skin, atrophic scars, and surgical and burn scars. Efforts to induce robust fibroplasia in histologic specimens and skin tightening in the clinical setting have yielded inconsistent results.

- **Conclusion**: A better understanding of the histology of fractional laser resurfacing will help to optimize clinical outcomes.

### The spectrum of laser skin resurfacing: nonablative, fractional, and ablative laser resurfacing [^114KfZyE]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

The drive to attain cosmetic facial enhancement with minimal risk and rapid recovery has inspired the field of nonsurgical skin rejuvenation. Laser resurfacing was introduced in the 1980s with continuous wave carbon dioxide (CO₂) lasers; however, due to a high rate of side effects, including scarring, short-pulse, high-peak power, and rapidly scanned, focused-beam CO₂ lasers and normal-mode erbium-doped yttrium aluminium garnet lasers were developed, which remove skin in a precisely controlled manner.

The prolonged 2-week recovery time and small but significant complication risk prompted the development of non-ablative and, more recently, fractional resurfacing to minimize risk and shorten recovery times. Nonablative resurfacing produces dermal thermal injury to improve rhytides and photodamage while preserving the epidermis. Fractional resurfacing thermally ablates microscopic columns of epidermal and dermal tissue in regularly spaced arrays over a fraction of the skin surface. This intermediate approach increases efficacy compared to nonablative resurfacing, but with faster recovery compared to ablative resurfacing. Neither nonablative nor fractional resurfacing produces results comparable to ablative laser skin resurfacing, but both have become much more popular than the latter because the risks of treatment are limited in the face of acceptable improvement.

At the completion of this learning activity, participants should be familiar with the spectrum of lasers and light technologies available for skin resurfacing.

### Treatment of acne vulgaris with fractional radiofrequency microneedling [^114KHGUv]. The Journal of Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Fractional radiofrequency microneedling is a novel radiofrequency technique using insulated microneedles to deliver energy to the deep dermis at the point of penetration without destroying the epidermis. It has been applied in treating various dermatological conditions, including wrinkles, atrophic scars, and hypertrophic scars. There have been few studies evaluating the efficacy of fractional radiofrequency microneedling for acne treatment, with none measuring objective parameters such as inflammatory and non-inflammatory acne lesions or sebum excretion levels.

The safety and efficacy of fractional radiofrequency microneedling in treating acne vulgaris were investigated in a prospective clinical trial involving 25 patients with moderate to severe acne. Treatment was administered three times at one-month intervals. **Collected data**: Acne lesion count, subjective satisfaction score, sebum excretion level, and adverse effects were assessed at baseline and at 4, 8, and 12 weeks after both the first and last treatment. The number of acne lesions, both inflammatory and non-inflammatory, decreased significantly. Sebum excretion and subjective satisfaction improved favorably at every time point compared with baseline values (P < 0.05). Inflammatory lesions responded better than non-inflammatory lesions (P < 0.05). Adverse effects, such as pinpoint bleeding, pain, and erythema, were noted but were transient and not severe enough to halt treatment. Fractional radiofrequency microneedling is a safe and potentially effective treatment for acne vulgaris.

### Biological effect of laser-assisted scar healing (LASH) on standardized human three-dimensional wound healing skin models using fractional non-ablative 1540 nm Er:Glass or 1550 nm diode lasers [^111XM8QX]. Lasers in Surgery and Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

In postoperative wound healing after surgical operations or ablative laser treatments, recent studies suggest the timely use of non-ablative fractional laser treatments to improve wound healing and prevent pathological scar formation. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. This study aimed to investigate the effects of laser-assisted scar healing (LASH) at the molecular level and to combine it with already established wound healing-promoting local treatments.

We irradiated full-thickness 3D skin models with a fractional ablative Er:YAG laser to set standardized lesions to the epidermal and upper dermal layer. Subsequently, LASH was induced by irradiating the models with either a fractional non-ablative 1540 nm Er:Glass or 1550 nm diode laser. In addition, we tested the combination of non-ablative fractional laser treatment and topical aftercare with a dexpanthenol-containing ointment (DCO).

Histological analysis revealed that models irradiated with the 1540 nm Er:Glass or 1550 nm diode laser exhibited accelerated but not complete wound closure after 16 hours. In contrast, additional topical posttreatment with DCO resulted in complete wound closure. At the gene expression level, both non-ablative laser systems showed similar effects on epidermal differentiation and mild anti-inflammatory properties. The additional posttreatment with DCO enhanced the wound-healing effects of LASH, especially the upregulation of epidermal differentiation markers and anti-inflammatory cytokines at the gene expression level.

### In vivo histological study evaluating non-ablative fractional 1940-nm laser [^117VDsec]. Lasers in Surgery and Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

Based on histologic evaluation, zones of coagulation and necrosis width and depth scaled with pulse energy, and the laser-induced MTZs healed well within six weeks. The 1940-nm NAFL created MTZs, as expected for this wavelength, that appear to be equivalent to MTZs created by other non-ablative fractional laser devices. Non-ablative fractional 1940-nm diode laser treatments are safe for treatments that benefit from fractional coagulation and necrosis of soft tissue. The 1940-nm NAFL creates fractional columns of injury having sufficient depth and coverage, suggesting effective skin resurfacing, similar to other non-ablative fractional lasers.

### Use of optical coherence tomography to assess properties of cutaneous defects following radiofrequency microneedling and laser treatment [^11417esq]. Lasers in Surgery and Medicine (2024). High credibility.

To characterize the properties of cutaneous defects created by energy-based devices, optical coherence tomography (OCT) was employed. Radiofrequency (RF) microneedling and non-ablative fractional laser (NAFL) treatments were conducted in vivo with various parameters. Following these treatments, OCT was utilized to image and measure cutaneous defects at multiple time points over a 24-hour period.

Channel-like cutaneous defects were visible with OCT after both bipolar RF microneedling and NAFL treatment. A double pulse technique with RF microneedling yielded a greater number of visible defects, which were deeper and more durable over time. Additionally, treatment with a 1927 nm thulium fiber laser resulted in defects with a larger average diameter when the energy level was set at 20 mJ compared to 10 mJ (0.33 mm vs. 0.27 mm, p < 0.01).

Cutaneous defects observed following RF microneedling and NAFL treatment displayed varied properties depending on the device, treatment settings, and technique. These findings may be instrumental in guiding further studies on device-assisted drug delivery.

### Neurosurgical interventions for the treatment of classical trigeminal neuralgia [^115op2V4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Surgical interventions are used for trigeminal neuralgia when drug treatment fails. Surgical treatments divide into two main categories: ablative (destructive) or non-ablative. These treatments can be done at three different sites: peripherally, at the Gasserian ganglion level, and within the posterior fossa of the skull.

- **Objectives**: To assess the efficacy of neurosurgical interventions for classical trigeminal neuralgia in terms of pain relief, quality of life, and any harms. To determine if there are defined subgroups of patients more likely to benefit.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Specialized Register (13 May 2010), CENTRAL (Issue 2, 2010 part of the Cochrane Library), Health Technology Assessment (HTA) Database, NHS Economic Evaluation Database (NHSEED), and Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE) (Issue 4, 2010). HTA, NHSEED, and DARE are part of the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (January 1966 to May 2010), and EMBASE (January 1980 to May 2010), with no language exclusion.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials and quasi-randomised controlled trials of neurosurgical interventions used in the treatment of classical trigeminal neuralgia.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We contacted authors for clarification and missing information whenever possible.

- **Main results**: Eleven studies involving 496 participants met some of the inclusion criteria stated in the protocol. One hundred and eighty patients in five studies had peripheral interventions.

### Low density, non-ablative fractional CO2 laser rejuvenation [^113JjmRD]. Lasers in Surgery and Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Fractional skin rejuvenation has gained increased interest since its introduction in 2003. Both non-ablative and ablative lasers, as well as different treatment techniques, have been devised. Recent clinical studies indicate that a paradigm of low spot density combined with high fluences tends to produce better clinical results and less risk of post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation in darker skin types. The present study focuses on investigations of the clinical outcome of non-ablative fractional CO2 treatments with a single pass and low spot density.

- **Methods and materials**: A CO2 laser was equipped with a scanner enabling it to perform fractional treatments with 36, 64, or 100 microthermal zones (MTZ)/cm². Twelve patients participated in the study. The perioral area was treated three times with 1-month intervals using a spot density of 64 MTZ/cm², a spot diameter of 0.5 mm, a micro-beam energy of 36–60 mJ, and a pulse duration of 3–5 milliseconds. Follow-up was performed 3 months after the last treatment.

- **Results**: At the 3-month follow-up, 72.7% of the volunteers had shown improvement in ultrasonographically determined dermal density, with an average improvement of 40.2% (SD: 48.0%). This improvement was statistically significant (P < 0.006). Eighty percent of the volunteers rated the reduction in visible perioral wrinkles as fair, good, or excellent. For the reduction of irregular pigmentation, fair, good, or excellent clearance was reported by 62.5% of the volunteers.

### Nonablative laser surgery for pigmented skin [^115Sp1cL]. Dermatologic Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Nonablative laser surgery has been proven to improve early photodamaged skin and acne scars. These techniques include treatments with lasers, light sources, and/or radiofrequency devices.

- **Objectives**: To review the history of nonablative technology and its applicability to darker skin types, and to provide an objective look at the various published studies documenting the efficacy of nonablative technology.

- **Conclusion**: Nonablative laser surgery can improve skin quality and acne scars in all skin types. Complications are rare but can occur. Future studies are required to compare the efficacy of the various nonablative technologies.

### Consensus recommendations for 4th generation non-microneedling monopolar radiofrequency for skin tightening: A Delphi consensus panel [^111s62rm]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2020). Low credibility.

The demand for non-invasive methods for facial and body rejuvenation has experienced exponential growth over the last two decades. While multiple treatment systems exist, device-specific guidelines to help guide clinicians to achieve the best outcomes are lacking.

- **Objective**: To develop expert consensus on the use of 4th generation non-microneedling monopolar radiofrequency. In a modified Delphi process, a panel of eight international experts in aesthetic dermatology participated in three rounds of consensus building, commencing in April 2019. Initially, 32 consensus statements were developed addressing patient selection, patient outcomes, treatment settings, and practical use of non-microneedling monopolar radiofrequency. By the third round, these had been reduced and refined to a total of 19 statements. The consensus process was completed in June 2019, and the data were analyzed in July 2019.

- **Results**: In three Delphi rounds, the eight panelists achieved consensus on 19 recommendations on the use of 4th generation non-microneedling monopolar radiofrequency and developed additional explanatory guidance to support 12 of the consensus statements, including those related to patient selection, procedural technique, and anticipated treatment outcomes.

Although guidelines will never replace individual clinical judgment, as the demand for noninvasive tissue tightening increases, so too does the need for positive, reproducible outcomes. Careful patient selection, pre-treatment counseling, treatment planning, and good technique are all critical for success.

### Fractional ablative laser therapy for the treatment of severe burn scars: A pilot study of the underlying mechanisms [^111wCy8w]. Burns (2023). Low credibility.

Ablative fractional resurfacing is clinically an efficient treatment for burn scar management. The aim of this pilot study was to investigate the poorly understood mechanisms underlying ablative fractional CO2 laser (AFL-CO2) therapy in relation to biomarkers S100 and 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11β-HSD1). S100 stains for Langerhans cells and neuronal cells, potentially representing the pruritus experienced. 11β-HSD1 catalyses the interconversion of cortisol and cortisone in cells, promoting tissue remodelling.

Immunohistochemical analysis of S100 and 11β-HSD1 protein expression in the dermis and epidermis of the skin was performed on normal skin, before and after AFL-CO2 therapy. Data assessing outcome parameters was collected concurrently with the skin biopsies. Thirteen patients were treated with AFL-CO2 therapy. Langerhans cells decreased by 39% after the second treatment. Neuronal cells were overexpressed before treatment in the scar tissue by 91%, but levels returned to those resembling normal skin. 11β-HSD1 expression in keratinocytes was significantly higher after laser treatment compared to before in scar tissue (p < 0.01). No clear correlation was found in dermal fibroblast numbers throughout the treatment course.

Whilst the role of the explored mechanisms and their association with clinical outcomes cannot conclusively be stated, this pilot study demonstrates promising trends that encourage further investigation into this relationship.

### A new approach with combined microneedle and sublative fractional radiofrequency for photoaging management: A clinical, histometric, and immunohistochemical study [^116dcc2x]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2025). Low credibility.

Over the past few decades, various interventional modalities have been developed to improve the appearance of photoaged skin. Traditionally, ablative laser remained the gold standard with robust efficacy but notable drawbacks and considerable downtime. Various non-ablative procedures are receiving more attention since they can rejuvenate the skin with minimal downtime and fewer adverse effects.

In the 1990s, RF emerged in cosmetic dermatology as a minimally invasive method for improving skin aging. By applying alternating electric current, RF technology generates kinetic energy that is converted to thermal energy. This process triggers collagen contraction and stimulates new collagen production, leading to dermal remodeling and skin tightening. RF is considered safe for darker skin types as it does not selectively target chromophores.

Studies on RF microneedling for skin rejuvenation reveal a 20–60% mean improvement in facial rhytides, skin laxity, and texture roughness after one to three sessions. Noticeable effects start at one month, peak at three months, and last up to seven months. Additionally, RF microneedling is well-tolerated and safe for all skin types.

Since Hantash et al.'s pioneering work on MFRF in 2009, numerous studies have examined its histological and cosmetic effects in both animal and human models, employing both insulated and non-insulated needles. Clinical research has shown its effectiveness in treating diverse skin issues like striae, texture irregularities, wrinkles, hyperpigmentation, skin laxity, and acne scars.

### The role of fractional radiofrequency in long-term acne remission and reduction of acne scar load [^116RQmWm]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2025). High credibility.

The Morpheus8 (InMode Ltd, Lake Forest, CA) is a fractional radiofrequency (RF) system that delivers thermal energy to variable depths of the skin through 24 parylene-coated, gold-plated pins. Fractional RF microneedling has a well-documented effect on improving the thickness of the reticular and papillary dermis connective tissue and fibers of the skin by inducing a cascade of growth factors, both in the face and body. The distal part of the tip, which is uncoated, creates a compact zone of ablation surrounded by two expanded zones of necrotic and subnecrotic nonspecific heating. This leads to significant tightening of the skin in addition to a noticeable improvement in skin quality via subacute (up to three months) neocollagenesis. The treatment of acne and acne scars with fractional RF microneedling devices has not previously been described.

- **Fractional radiofrequency tips**: (A) Morpheus8. (B) Morpheus8 T Resurfacing (InMode Ltd, Lake Forest, CA).

The purpose of this supplement is to introduce the utility of applying fractional RF microneedling for the treatment of acne in all its forms, with the goal of providing long-term remission, considered as a relapse rate of less than 15% in a five-year period, and effective early scar remodeling. Furthermore, specific protocols for late acne scar remodeling that utilize fractional RF in combination with other modalities will also be discussed.

### The role of fractional radiofrequency in long-term acne remission and reduction of acne scar load [^114SuX5X]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2025). Low credibility.

Differences between fractional radiofrequency technologies.

There are different forms of RF energy with medical applications. Most available systems are bipolar RF, meaning that the energy alternates between positively and negatively charged electrodes situated close together within the system. Most fractional devices on the market today consist of a row of positively charged electrodes positioned parallel to a row of negatively charged ones, so that the RF arc travels a very small distance between the pairs of tips. This configuration results in a very small and superficial zone of ablation, and the induced wound-healing cascade is not very different than standard needling without RF.

The Morpheus8 bipolar fractional RF microneedling system is designed differently and offers noticeable advantages. The electrode pins are all positively/negatively charged, with the grid surrounding each pin located at the interface of the tip near the skin, having the opposite charge. As such, the RF loop is large and induces a bigger and deeper zone of ablation or coagulation that leads to a large quantity of released cytokines and growth factors. Fractional RF treatment spares the epidermis, except for the mechanical injury to the skin, and is considered to be significantly safer in darker skin types.

### Radiofrequency ablation: Emerging therapy for the small pulmonary nodule [^114Yhu5j]. Seminars in Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Traditional approaches to small pulmonary nodules have ranged from serial radiographic surveillance to transthoracic needle aspiration to surgical resection for diagnosis. Once the diagnosis of non-small-cell lung cancer is secured, lobectomy remains the gold standard treatment. Nevertheless, advances in image-guided technology and radiofrequency thermal ablation techniques have allowed for diagnostic sampling of lesions with concomitant therapeutic thermal ablation. The role these techniques will play in the treatment of patients with primary lung cancer remains undefined.

- **Basic technology**: This review examines the basic technology of radiofrequency ablation.
- **Clinical experience update**: It provides an update on clinical experience with this technique.
- **Role in treatment**: Additionally, it explores the role of radiofrequency ablation in the treatment scheme of patients with non-small-cell lung cancer.

### British Thoracic Society guidelines for the investigation and management of pulmonary nodules [^112VP7kY]. Thorax (2015). High credibility.

The guidelines from the British Thoracic Society (BTS) in 2015 address therapeutic procedures for pulmonary nodules, particularly emphasizing radiotherapy and radiofrequency ablation. They recommend considering the offer of stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy or radiofrequency ablation for patients who are unfit for surgery, have pulmonary nodules with a high probability of malignancy, and when biopsy is nondiagnostic or not possible, provided these procedures are technically suitable.

### Single treatment protocol with microneedle fractional radiofrequency for treatment of body skin laxity and fat deposits [^1156BUaw]. Lasers in Surgery and Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

There has been no shortage of device-driven technology solutions introduced as treatment options in efforts to avoid more invasive approaches such as liposuction or the formation of cosmetically unappealing scars secondary to cold steel excisional solutions. Non-ablative and ablative fractional lasers, as well as infrared lasers/light sources, have been previously considered. However, non-surgical skin tightening has been a historically difficult procedure to promote in the past, with many treatments not achieving significant clinical results and, therefore, resulting in low patient satisfaction. Perhaps the most studied devices in recent years have been microfocused ultrasound (MFU) with visualization and radiofrequency-based devices in both facial and non-facial skin.

MFU can be focused on subcutaneous tissue, where the temperature briefly reaches greater than 60°C, producing small (1 mm³) thermal coagulation points to a depth of up to 5 mm within the mid-to-deep reticular layer of the dermis and subdermis.

- **Layering techniques**: Layering different depths of coagulation points has been studied as an optimal method for simultaneously contracting the deeper fascial layers at depths of 3 mm (7-mHz transducer) and 4.5 mm (4-mHz transducer), while stimulating dermal collagen at more superficial depths of 1.5 and 2 mm. Comparison studies have shown no difference in efficacy with regards to MFU and monopolar radiofrequency in the improvement in facial/neck skin laxity. However, even with layering techniques, MVU-targeted, thermally coagulated tissue does not reach the same volume of the treated tissue.

### Ablative skin resurfacing with a novel microablative CO2 laser [^114yhxmL]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Carbon dioxide (CO2) laser skin resurfacing has been a mainstay of facial rejuvenation since its introduction in the mid-1990s. Recently, a new generation of fractional or microablative CO2 lasers has been introduced to the marketplace. According to the concept of fractional photothermolysis, these lasers ablate only a fraction of the epidermal and dermal architecture in the treatment area. An array of microscopic thermal wounds is created that ablates the epidermis and dermis within very tiny zones; adjacent to these areas, the epidermis and dermis are spared. This microablative process of laser skin resurfacing has proven safe and effective not only for facial rejuvenation but also elsewhere on the body. It is capable of improving wrinkles, acne scars, and other types of atrophic scars and benign pigmented lesions associated with elastotic, sun-damaged skin. Because of the areas of spared epidermis and dermis inherent in a procedure that employs fractional photothermolysis, healing is more rapid compared to fully ablative CO2 laser skin resurfacing, and downtime is proportionately reduced.

A series of 32 consecutive patients underwent a single laser resurfacing procedure with a new microablative CO2 laser. All patients were followed for a minimum of 6 months and were asked to complete patient satisfaction questionnaires. A 6-month postoperative photographic evaluation by an independent physician, not involved in the treatment, was also performed. Both sets of data were graded and reported on a quartile scale. Results demonstrated greater than 50% improvement in alm.

### Nonablative fractional resurfacing in the male patient [^115pPTNY]. Dermatologic Therapy (2007). Low credibility.

Skin resurfacing can be divided into nonablative, nonablative fractional, ablative fractional, and traditional ablative categories. Nonablative technologies have yielded inconsistent and unimpressive results, whereas ablative technologies, although generally clinically effective, are losing momentum due to prolonged recovery times, risks for hypopigmentation, limitations in lighter skin types, and the production of unnatural sheen and texture to the skin. Fractional resurfacing combines the safety of nonablative technologies and the efficacy of traditional ablative resurfacing.

Nonablative fractional resurfacing is the most widely studied of the fractional technologies, allowing for nonablative tissue coagulation, the creation of microthermal zones, and resurfacing with extrusion and replacement of damaged tissue with rapid re-epithelialization. This article reviews nonablative fractional resurfacing with a 1550-nm laser in male patients.

### Will nonablative rejuvenation replace ablative lasers? Facts and controversies [^1141YsiG]. Clinics in Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Since the early 1980s, the field of skin rejuvenation has evolved rapidly. Traditional ablative resurfacing, using carbon dioxide and Er:YAG lasers, offered dramatic improvement in skin tone and texture. However, the prolonged postoperative period and an increased risk of side effects and complications were unacceptable to the majority of patients. This prompted the development of nonablative lasers and non-laser systems, which stimulate dermal neocollagenesis without epidermal disruption, thus producing fewer adverse effects with little or no healing time.

Recently, fractional nonablative and ablative lasers have been introduced, employing a completely new concept of fractional photothermolysis, which ensures high efficacy with fewer risks. Ablative laser resurfacing still remains the gold standard for treating advanced and severe photoaging, providing excellent results in experienced hands. Alternatively, ablative fractional resurfacing can be used, with results comparable to fully ablative lasers but with a better standard of safety.

Nonablative resurfacing is ideal for patients under the age of 50 years with minimal facial sagging who are unwilling to undergo expensive and demanding ablative procedures. It can be concluded that the key to therapeutic success lies in proper patient selection, setting appropriate expectations, and combining different rejuvenation technologies with other therapeutic modalities, such as botulinum toxin and fillers.

### A new approach with combined microneedle and sublative fractional radiofrequency for photoaging management: A clinical, histometric, and immunohistochemical study [^116QiJLD]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2025). Low credibility.

Various RF devices are available, including monopolar, bipolar, fractional, and multipolar energy modes, which typically contain a generator and a handheld applicator with electrodes. In 2008, the FDA approved fractional radiofrequency (FRF) to offer skin rejuvenation; this bipolar RF system generates fractional zones of electrothermal damage deep in the dermis, surrounded by areas of undamaged tissue under a more-or-less intact epidermis. These areas of damage in the dermal matrix induced a vigorous wound-healing process supported by the surrounding undamaged tissue and led to the synthesis of new collagen and elastin, dermal remodeling, and replenishment of hyaluronic acid.

FRF appears to combine the benefits of ablative and non-ablative laser therapy while being associated with fewer side effects, making it an attractive choice. Brightman et al. (2009) introduced the term "sublative" as a derivative of "sub-ablative", which described the ability to ablate the superficial epidermis together with the generation of pyramid-shaped thermal energy underneath the ablated epidermal zone, unlike the columnar shape of ablative lasers. It is accepted that the effective impact of a bipolar RF electrode is half the distance between the electrodes. Therefore, the 64-pin-electrode, having an inter-pin distance of 1.5 mm, may impact the tissue up to 750 μm.

### The role of fractional radiofrequency in long-term acne remission and reduction of acne scar load [^117SKTBm]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2025). Low credibility.

During the treatment, both the standard fractional RF microneedling tip and the "resurfacing tip" were used. Both tips consist of 24 pins, but the former is coated (except the distal 0.5 mm) and can reach depths of 1 to 4 mm, whereas the latter is non-coated and fixed at a depth of 0.5 mm. Table 1 provides an outline of the settings used based on Fitzpatrick skin type.

The treatment starts with passes at the deeper layers first and continues superficially. Depending on skin thickness, a depth of 3 mm or 2 mm is chosen to commence the treatment. Once the tip is placed firmly against the skin, a foot pedal is used to activate the device and deliver the pulses of energy.

In general, at depths of more than 2 mm, the device is set to "fixed mode", which enables it to deliver several pulses of RF energy through the pins continuously as long as the foot pedal is engaged. The system delivers an acoustic signal to indicate the delivery of each pulse, and the tip is activated to deliver double-stacked pulses at the predetermined depth. Once the double-stacked pulses are delivered, the handpiece is moved over the skin such that it overlaps 50% with the previous treatment area. A set of double-stacked pulses is delivered to each site. Once the treatment zone has received 1 pass of stacked pulses, a second pass that overlays the previous treatment is conducted. This ensures that the treatment zone has received 2 passes of 2 stacks each.

Following this, the more superficial depth is started, to ensure full coverage of the treatment zones.
