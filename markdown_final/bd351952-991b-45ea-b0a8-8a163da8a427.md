## Question

How is severe sepsis classified?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how severe sepsis is classified. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the most current consensus definitions and whether the term "severe sepsis" still exists. Then, I should verify the present-day classification tiers and their operational criteria. Next, I will contrast this with the historical, pre‑2016 framework for context. Finally, I should consider any nuances in pediatrics and real‑world usage so I don't overstate uniform adoption of the new terminology.

> Let me first confirm the current authoritative definition. Wait, let me verify if "severe sepsis" remains a defined category under Sepsis‑3. The 2016 Third International Consensus (Sepsis‑3) explicitly concluded that the term "severe sepsis" was redundant because sepsis itself now requires life‑threatening organ dysfunction, which previously marked "severe" disease [^115A1XRf] [^112DCACY].

> I will now examine the current classification. Hold on, I should verify the exact wording and thresholds. Under Sepsis‑3, the spectrum is two‑tier: sepsis, defined as suspected or documented infection with acute organ dysfunction operationalized as an increase in SOFA score of 2 points or more from baseline, and septic shock, defined as a subset of sepsis with profound circulatory, cellular, and metabolic abnormalities requiring vasopressor therapy to maintain a mean arterial pressure of at least 65 mmHg and having a serum lactate level greater than 2 mmol/L after adequate fluid resuscitation, in the absence of hypovolemia [^115A1XRf] [^112suHuL].

> Next, I should review the historical framework to avoid confusion. Let me think about how it used to be categorized. Before 2016, the ACCP/SCCM model progressed from infection to sepsis (infection plus SIRS), to severe sepsis (sepsis with organ dysfunction, hypoperfusion, or hypotension), and then to septic shock (hypotension refractory to fluids); this is the construct many clinicians recall as "severe sepsis", but Sepsis‑3 retired that middle category by moving organ dysfunction into the definition of sepsis itself [^113faCoX] [^115EQsJt].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about universal adoption. I should confirm real‑world usage and any controversies. Although major guideline efforts and reviews align with Sepsis‑3's two‑tier structure, some stakeholders have raised concerns about detecting high‑risk infections before overt organ dysfunction, and documentation and regulatory uptake have been variable in certain settings; nonetheless, for classification and research, Sepsis‑3's elimination of the "severe sepsis" label is the prevailing standard [^112JPJMT] [^113p97aa] [^113DeioC].

> But wait, what about children. I need to check pediatric nuances so I don't overgeneralize from adults. Pediatric sepsis definitions are being actively revisited, with task forces emphasizing context‑specific operationalization across global settings; while legacy pediatric literature used "severe sepsis", current pediatric efforts are moving toward criteria that emphasize life‑threatening organ dysfunction and timely recognition, broadly paralleling the adult conceptual shift, though finalized pediatric operational definitions are still evolving [^114vHH6V] [^114iswjs] [^114Nb3j3].

> Let me reconsider and synthesize the direct answer to the user's question, and I should double‑check I'm precise. "Severe sepsis" is no longer classified as a distinct entity under Sepsis‑3; what used to be called "severe sepsis" (sepsis with organ dysfunction) is now encompassed within "sepsis", and the current classification is binary: sepsis, defined by infection with an increase in SOFA by at least 2 points, and septic shock, defined by sepsis with vasopressor requirement to maintain MAP at least 65 mmHg and lactate greater than 2 mmol/L after adequate fluids; historically, in pre‑2016 frameworks, "severe sepsis" meant sepsis with organ dysfunction or hypoperfusion, but that term has been retired in contemporary adult classification [^115A1XRf] [^112suHuL] [^113faCoX].

---

Severe sepsis refers to sepsis with acute organ dysfunction, hypoperfusion, or hypotension and is now encompassed by Sepsis-3 as **life-threatening organ dysfunction** from a dysregulated host response to infection [^115A1XRf], defined operationally as a **SOFA score increase of ≥ 2 points** [^115tUKZq]. The term "severe sepsis" has been **removed from current classifications**, with sepsis defined by infection plus organ dysfunction and septic shock by vasopressor-dependent hypotension with lactate > 2 mmol/L despite fluids [^111T4vxG] [^112suHuL]. This shift emphasizes early recognition and management of organ dysfunction [^112JPJMT]; the SOFA score is central to current classification and risk stratification [^112DCACY].

---

## Historical definitions and evolution

The 1991 ACCP/SCCM consensus defined sepsis as infection plus SIRS; severe sepsis as sepsis with organ dysfunction, hypoperfusion, or hypotension; and septic shock as persistent hypotension despite fluids [^113faCoX]. In 2001, the international sepsis definitions conference retained severe sepsis as sepsis with acute organ dysfunction, hypoperfusion, or hypotension [^113faCoX] [^115mPnnT]. Sepsis-3 (2016) redefined sepsis as life-threatening organ dysfunction from a dysregulated host response to infection, operationalized as an increase in SOFA score of ≥ 2 points, and **removed the term** "severe sepsis" as redundant [^115A1XRf] [^115tUKZq].

---

## Current classification criteria (sepsis-3)

| **Category** | **Definition** | **Clinical criteria** |
|-|-|-|
| Sepsis | Life-threatening organ dysfunction from a dysregulated host response to infection | SOFA score increase ≥ 2 points [^115A1XRf] from baseline [^115tUKZq] |
| Septic shock | Subset of sepsis with profound circulatory, cellular, and metabolic abnormalities | - Vasopressor therapy to maintain MAP ≥ 65 mmHg [^112suHuL] <br/> - Serum lactate > 2 mmol/L despite adequate fluid resuscitation [^115A1XRf] [^115tUKZq] |

---

## Clinical manifestations and organ dysfunction

Severe sepsis (now **sepsis with organ dysfunction**) presents with diverse forms of organ dysfunction, including [^111T4vxG]:

- **Respiratory**: Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), hypoxemia.

- **Cardiovascular**: Hypotension, shock, arrhythmias.

- **Renal**: Acute kidney injury, oliguria.

- **Hepatic**: Hyperbilirubinemia, coagulopathy.

- **Neurologic**: Altered mental status, delirium.

- **Hematologic**: Thrombocytopenia, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).

---

## Diagnostic tools and biomarkers

- **SOFA score**: Central to Sepsis-3 for quantifying organ dysfunction and risk stratification [^115A1XRf] [^112DCACY].

- **qSOFA**: Rapid bedside tool (respiratory rate ≥ 22, altered mentation, systolic BP ≤ 100 mmHg) for identifying patients at risk of poor outcomes [^112DCACY] [^115tUKZq].

- **Biomarkers**: Lactate, procalcitonin, and C-reactive protein (CRP) support diagnosis and monitoring.

---

## Clinical implications of sepsis-3 redefinition

The Sepsis-3 redefinition emphasizes **early recognition** and prompt identification and management of organ dysfunction [^111T4vxG]. It also provides a consistent framework for clinical practice, research, and epidemiology, and guides appropriate use of critical care resources [^115tUKZq].

---

## Controversies and challenges

Controversies and challenges include the **loss of "severe sepsis" — some clinicians argue that removing the term may delay recognition and treatment of early organ dysfunction [^1148pq6L] — and concerns about **applicability, particularly Sepsis-3's suitability in resource-limited settings and pediatric populations [^114djv1k] [^114vHH6V].

---

## Impact on clinical practice and outcomes

Implementation of Sepsis-3 and SSC guidelines [^112JPJMT] has been associated with **mortality reduction** [^111q9AYh]. Early recognition and standardized management are linked to **improved outcomes**, reducing healthcare costs [^111T4vxG].

---

## Future directions and research priorities

Future directions include **personalized medicine** with targeted therapies based on patient-specific factors [^117MBfak] [^113VeMWH] and advances in rapid diagnostic tools and biomarkers [^112eJYYS]. Efforts also focus on adapting definitions and guidelines to diverse healthcare settings to enhance global applicability [^114djv1k].

---

Severe sepsis now denotes sepsis with organ dysfunction, but the term has been removed from current classifications [^115A1XRf]. The Sepsis-3 definition emphasizes early recognition and management of organ dysfunction, with the **SOFA score as a central tool** for classification and risk stratification [^112DCACY].

## References

### The third international consensus definitions for sepsis and septic shock (Sepsis-3) [^115A1XRf]. JAMA (2016). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on sepsis and septic shock:

- **Definition**: According to the Sepsis-3 definition, sepsis is characterized by life-threatening organ dysfunction, defined as an increase of ≥ 2 points from baseline in the SOFA score, caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. Systemic inflammatory response syndrome is no longer included in the definition of sepsis. Septic shock is defined as sepsis with profound circulatory, cellular, and metabolic abnormalities, requiring vasopressor therapy to maintain a mean arterial pressure of ≥ 65 mmHg and a serum lactate level > 2 mmol/L (> 18 mg/dL) in the absence of hypovolemia.

- **Pathophysiology**: The most common infectious pathogens responsible for the development of sepsis are S. aureus (20.5%), Pseudomonas species (19.9%), fungi (19%), E. coli (16.0%), Klebsiella species (12.7%), and Acinetobacter (9%).

- **Epidemiology**: In hospitalized adult patients, the incidence of sepsis is estimated at 6.0%.

- **Disease course**: In patients with sepsis, the continued activation of immune cells in response to an infection results in a dysregulated inflammatory response. The coagulation system is closely tied to the inflammatory response, with cross talk between the two systems. These pathophysiological changes cause the clinical manifestations of organ dysfunction, which may progress to multiple organ failure and death.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The overall mortality associated with sepsis, severe sepsis, and septic shock is 10–20%, 20–50%, and 40–80%, respectively.

### The third international consensus definitions for sepsis and septic shock (Sepsis-3) [^115tUKZq]. JAMA (2016). Low credibility.

- **Importance**: Definitions of sepsis and septic shock were last revised in 2001. Considerable advances have since been made into the pathobiology (changes in organ function, morphology, cell biology, biochemistry, immunology, and circulation), management, and epidemiology of sepsis, suggesting the need for reexamination.

- **Objective**: To evaluate and, as needed, update definitions for sepsis and septic shock.

- **Process**: A task force (n = 19) with expertise in sepsis pathobiology, clinical trials, and epidemiology was convened by the Society of Critical Care Medicine and the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine. Definitions and clinical criteria were generated through meetings, Delphi processes, analysis of electronic health record databases, and voting, followed by circulation to international professional societies, requesting peer review and endorsement by 31 societies listed in the Acknowledgment.

- **Key findings from evidence synthesis**: Limitations of previous definitions included an excessive focus on inflammation, the misleading model that sepsis follows a continuum through severe sepsis to shock, and inadequate specificity and sensitivity of the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria. Multiple definitions and terminologies are currently in use for sepsis, septic shock, and organ dysfunction, leading to discrepancies in reported incidence and observed mortality. The task force concluded the term severe sepsis was redundant.

- **Recommendations**: Sepsis should be defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection.

Regarding medical management for sepsis and septic shock, and more specifically with respect to antimicrobial therapy, the SSC 2021 guidelines recommend considering a time-limited course of rapid investigation in adult patients with possible sepsis without shock. It is advised to administer antimicrobials within 3 hours from the time when sepsis was first recognized if a concern for infection persists.

### Raising concerns about the sepsis-3 definitions [^113p97aa]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Sepsis is a multifaceted host response to an infecting pathogen that may be significantly amplified by endogenous factors. If left untreated, it may lead to the functional impairment of one or more vital organs or systems. There are many well-known risk factors for the infections that most commonly precipitate organ dysfunction, including acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, many cancers, the use of immunosuppressive agents, and advanced age. Although significant steps forward have been made, the pathophysiological mechanisms for organ dysfunction are not entirely known. However, it has become apparent that infection triggers a much more complex, variable, and prolonged host response, involving early activation of both pro- and anti-inflammatory responses.

Sepsis has variable clinical presentations depending on the initial site of infection, the causative organism, the pattern of acute organ dysfunction, and the underlying health status of the patient. There is general consensus that early recognition and timely treatment largely determine the outcome of sepsis.

Since the first classification in 1991, the definition of sepsis, severe sepsis, and septic shock, though imprecise, have provided clinicians with a useful framework for clinical management. By stressing the need for early recognition, and when these criteria are followed by applying the Surviving Sepsis Campaign recommendations, they have shown an impressive history of success in reducing the mortality of sepsis in several areas of the world.

### Raising concerns about the sepsis-3 definitions [^1148pq6L]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

The pathogenesis of sepsis involves a complex interaction between the host immune system and the infecting microorganisms. Sepsis describes a broad-based syndrome covering many infectious agents, affecting various sites in patients of differing age, gender, and comorbidity. Its clinical manifestations are highly variable and may lead to severe organ dysfunction and death. Despite remarkable advances in the management of patients with sepsis, its recognition and timely, appropriate treatment remain of utmost importance.

The Sepsis-3 definitions underline the concept of a dysregulated immune response resulting in potentially modifiable life-threatening organ dysfunction. However, they may fail in identifying patients with serious infections before organ dysfunction ensues.

Downplaying infections that do not meet the Sepsis-3 criteria may hinder their identification, resulting in an unnecessary increase in both morbidity and mortality due to their inexorable progression in the following hours.

Clear definitions for sepsis and septic shock should guide clinicians both to support early recognition of at-risk patients and to facilitate an understanding of the global epidemiology of sepsis.

Sepsis is a burden for global health. Its global nature calls for a global response, both in the geographic sense and across the whole range of sectors involved.

In this paper, we have raised our concerns regarding the Sepsis-3 definitions. We believe that in order for sepsis definitions to be universally accepted, they should facilitate clinical care on a global scale.

### Operationalizing appropriate sepsis definitions in children worldwide: Considerations for the Pediatric Sepsis Definition Taskforce [^114vHH6V]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2023). High credibility.

In this special article from the Pediatric Sepsis Definition Taskforce of the Society of Critical Care Medicine, we present a conceptual framework and a rationale of the critical aspects and context-specific factors that must be considered for the operationalization of sepsis definitions in children around the world. These include biological factors, epidemiology, differences in the pathways to care, pretest probabilities of sepsis at different levels of care, and the resources that are available to provide care.

### Operationalizing appropriate sepsis definitions in children worldwide: Considerations for the pediatric sepsis definition taskforce [^114iswjs]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Sepsis is a leading cause of global mortality in children, yet definitions for pediatric sepsis are outdated and lack global applicability and validity. In adults, the Sepsis-3 Definition Taskforce queried databases from high-income countries to develop and validate the criteria. The merit of this definition has been widely acknowledged; however, important considerations about less-resourced and more diverse settings pose challenges to its use globally.

To improve applicability and relevance globally, the Pediatric Sepsis Definition Taskforce sought to develop a conceptual framework and rationale for the critical aspects and context-specific factors that must be considered for the optimal operationalization of future pediatric sepsis definitions. It is important to address challenges in developing a set of pediatric sepsis criteria which capture manifestations of illnesses with vastly different etiologies and underlying mechanisms. Ideal criteria need to be unambiguous and capable of adapting to the different contexts in which children with suspected infections are present around the globe.

Additionally, criteria need to facilitate early recognition and timely escalation of treatment to prevent progression and limit life-threatening organ dysfunction. To address these challenges, locally adaptable solutions are required, which permit individualized care based on available resources and the pretest probability of sepsis. This should facilitate affordable diagnostics that support risk stratification and prediction of likely treatment responses, and solutions for locally relevant interventions.

### Beyond septic shock: who else requires immediate antibiotics [^116u9zSX]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

Landmark studies published almost 20 years ago documented strong associations between time to antibiotic therapy and mortality in critically ill patients, most of whom had septic shock. These findings catalyzed early versions of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign that recommended administering antibiotics within 1 hour after the diagnosis of sepsis with any acute organ dysfunction, not just septic shock. Some state and national quality metrics further extended this guidance, requiring rapid administration of antibiotic therapy for all patients with suspected sepsis or septic shock.

Sepsis, however, is a broad and heterogeneous syndrome that encompasses a wide range of inciting organisms, sites of infection, and patterns of organ dysfunctions. These differences are magnified by host factors, including extremes of age, comorbidities, and immune function. The manifestations of sepsis, prognoses, and the impact of therapy are very different for a young and healthy host with bacterial pneumonia compared with a geriatric patient with cancer complicated by neutropenia and disseminated fungal infection.

The latest version of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines recognizes some of this variability. The 2021 guidelines suggest that patients be stratified by certainty of infection and severity of illness. Specifically, they advise antibiotic therapy within 1 hour after recognition in all patients with possible septic shock and all patients with definite or probable sepsis without shock. In patients with possible sepsis without shock, however, in whom the diagnosis of infection is uncertain…

### Developing a new definition and assessing new clinical criteria for septic shock: For the Third International Consensus Definitions for Sepsis and Septic Shock (Sepsis-3) [^112suHuL]. JAMA (2016). High credibility.

Septic shock currently refers to a state of acute circulatory failure associated with infection. Emerging biological insights and reported variation in epidemiology challenge the validity of this definition. The objective of this study was to develop a new definition and clinical criteria for identifying septic shock in adults.

The Society of Critical Care Medicine and the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine convened a task force, consisting of 19 participants, to revise sepsis and septic shock definitions. The task force conducted three sets of studies:

- **Systematic review and meta-analysis**: Observational studies in adults published between January 1, 1992, and December 25, 2015, were reviewed to determine clinical criteria currently reported to identify septic shock and inform the Delphi process.
- **Delphi study**: This involved the task force conducting three surveys and discussions of results from the systematic review, surveys, and cohort studies to achieve consensus on a new septic shock definition and clinical criteria.
- **Cohort studies**: They tested variables identified by the Delphi process using data sets from the Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) (2005–2010; n = 28,150), University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) (2010–2012; n = 1,309,025), and Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) (2009–2013; n = 1,847,165) electronic health records.

The main outcomes and measures focused on evidence for and agreement on septic shock definitions and criteria. The systematic review identified 44 studies reporting septic shock outcomes, involving a total of 166,479 patients, from a pool of 92 sepsis studies.

### The effect of early goal-directed therapy on outcome in adult severe sepsis and septic shock patients: A meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials [^111fee28]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2016). Low credibility.

The effects of early goal-directed therapy (EGDT) on intensive care unit (ICU) mortality in severe sepsis and septic shock patients were evaluated across four trials. EGDT significantly reduced ICU mortality in these patients, demonstrating a relative risk (RR) of 0.72 (99% confidence interval, 0.57–0.90; P = 0.0002).

- **Effects on mortality in patients with different severity of illness**: The effects of EGDT on mortality varied according to the severity of illness, which was assessed in each study using the acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II (APACHE II) score. The data were presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD) or medians with interquartile ranges. The differentiation between higher and less severity of illness was determined by the means of APACHE II scores reported in each article. In five trials, patients had APACHE II scores > 20, while in the remaining three, scores were < 20 or unclear. For patients with a higher severity of disease (APACHE II score ≥ 20), there was a trend toward mortality benefit from EGDT compared to control care, with a RR of 0.87 (99% CI, 0.74–1.03; P = 0.03).

### Sepsis in the 21st century: Recent definitions and therapeutic advances [^115QLdp9]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Sepsis as a disease has received renewed interest since recent publications of a revised clinical definition, along with crucial clinical trials showing the benefits of early goal-directed resuscitation, recombinant human activated protein C, and low-dose corticosteroids. The epidemiology of sepsis has also been further examined. Management guidelines and international quality improvement efforts have been developed, targeting increased disease identification, clinician education, and optimal patient care, with the result of decreasing patient mortality. The evidence suggests that early recognition and early intervention are most important in affecting outcomes. This article will summarize these developments in the diagnosis and management of sepsis at the turn of this century.

### Surviving sepsis campaign: Research priorities for sepsis and septic shock [^117MBfak]. Intensive Care Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

The objective was to identify research priorities in the management, epidemiology, outcomes, and underlying causes of sepsis and septic shock.

- **Design**: A consensus committee of 16 international experts, representing the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine and the Society of Critical Care Medicine, was convened at the annual meetings of both societies. Subgroups engaged in teleconference and electronic-based discussions. The entire committee iteratively developed the document and recommendations.

- **Methods**: Each committee member independently identified their top five priorities for sepsis research, resulting in a total of 88 suggestions. These were grouped into categories by the committee co-chairs, forming seven subgroups: infection, fluids and vasoactive agents, adjunctive therapy, administration/epidemiology, scoring/identification, post-intensive care unit, and basic/translational science. Subgroup discussions followed by formal voting determined the key priorities. A vote by the entire committee was conducted on top priorities across all subgroups except for basic/translational science.

- **Results**: The Surviving Sepsis Research Committee provided 26 priorities for sepsis and septic shock. Among these, the top six clinical priorities include:
	1. Can targeted/personalized/precision medicine approaches determine which therapies will work for which patients at which times?
	2. What are ideal endpoints for volume resuscitation and how should volume resuscitation be titrated?
	3. Should rapid diagnostic…

### What's new in sepsis recognition in resource-limited settings [^111jp5j1]. Intensive Care Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Sepsis is not only associated with bacterial or fungal infections but also with other infections such as viral diseases, protozoal infections (e.g. malaria), or tropical infections. We provided a set of simple, readily available, and affordable recommendations on how to recognize sepsis, identify the underlying type of infection, identify the causative microbiological pathogen, and recognize septic shock in resource-limited settings. As most evidence originates from resource-rich settings, there is an urgent need for related research in resource-limited settings.

### Sepsis subphenotypes, theragnostics and personalized sepsis care [^113VeMWH]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Sepsis is a heterogeneous condition characterized by a dysregulated host response to infection that leads to life-threatening organ dysfunction. Globally, sepsis accounts for eleven million deaths each year and continues to be one of the leading causes of death. Treatment has remained fundamentally unchanged over decades and comprises early antibiotics, source control, and supportive care with interventions such as intravenous fluids and vasopressors. No biological therapies that modulate the host response have reached sustained clinical practice, with many negative or neutral clinical trials.

The reason for this is at least in part due to the clinical, microbiological, and immunological heterogeneity of sepsis, where patients with similar disease entities can have very different presentations or responses to treatment. Increasing recognition of the immunological concepts underpinning heterogeneity, including resistance, disease tolerance, and repair, may enable the identification of further mechanisms which could be targeted by therapeutics. Furthermore, there is also emerging evidence that this heterogeneity extends to individual patients' responses to interventions: while some patients may derive benefit from an intervention, others may not and may even experience harm. In order to better target treatments and deliver effective therapies, it is necessary to identify which patients will benefit from specific therapies. This personalized medicine approach has been identified as a research priority by clinicians, patients, and their families.

### The surviving sepsis campaign: Fluid resuscitation and vasopressor therapy research priorities in adult patients [^116Xkvmv]. Critical Care Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

The Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) is a long-standing initiative of the Society of Critical Care Medicine and the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine designed to improve mortality from sepsis. The Campaign has released four sets of guidelines, with another due to be published in 2021. Although recommendations within the SSC guidelines have been associated with improved outcomes, the guidelines are often unable to make more specific recommendations in multiple areas of clinical importance due to ongoing gaps in the literature.

In an attempt to define priorities for research within the field of sepsis, the SSC created a research committee tasked with developing a list of research questions related to sepsis. This led to the joint publication of "Surviving Sepsis Campaign Research Priorities for Sepsis and Septic Shock" in Critical Care Medicine and Intensive Care Medicine in August 2018.

The initial document presented a broad overview, identifying 26 questions to explore as research priorities in several domains, with an explicit intention to publish separate papers with more detailed descriptions for each domain in the future. This article is the second in a series of manuscripts (following a prior effort devoted to basic science research), which will expand upon the three research questions related to fluid resuscitation and vasopressors originating from the broader publication.

### Recognizing and managing sepsis: What needs to be done [^114a2P75]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Sepsis is associated with significant morbidity and mortality if not promptly recognized and treated. Since the development of early goal-directed therapy, mortality rates have decreased, yet sepsis remains a major cause of death in patients arriving at the emergency department or staying in the hospital. In this forum article, we asked clinicians and researchers with expertise in sepsis care to discuss the importance of rapid detection and treatment of the condition, as well as special considerations in different patient groups.

### Potential impact of the 2016 consensus definitions of sepsis and septic shock on future sepsis research [^113aSRoR]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

The influence of the Third International Consensus Definitions for Sepsis and Septic Shock (Sepsis-3) on the conduct of future sepsis research is unknown. We seek to examine the potential effect of the new definitions on the identification and outcomes of patients enrolled in a sepsis trial.

- **Methods**: This was a post hoc analysis of the Australasian Resuscitation in Sepsis Evaluation (ARISE) trial of early goal-directed therapy that recruited 1,591 adult patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with early septic shock diagnosed by greater than or equal to 2 systemic inflammatory response syndrome criteria and either refractory hypotension or hyperlactatemia. The proportion of participants who would have met the Sepsis-3 criteria for quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) score, sepsis (an increased Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score ≥ 2 because of infection), and septic shock before randomization, their baseline characteristics, interventions delivered, and mortality were determined.

- **Results**: There were 1,139 participants who had a qSOFA score of greater than or equal to 2 at baseline (71.6% [95% confidence interval {CI} 69.4% to 73.8%]). In contrast, 1,347 participants (84.7% [95% CI 82.9% to 86.4%]) met the Sepsis-3 criteria for sepsis. Only 1,010 participants were both qSOFA positive and met the Sepsis-3 criteria for sepsis (63.5% [95% CI 61.1% to 65.8%]). The Sepsis-3 definition for septic shock was met at baseline by 203 participants (12.8% [95% CI 11.2% to 14.5%]), of whom 175 (86.2% [95% CI 81.5% to 91.0%]) were also qSOFA positive.

### Raising concerns about the sepsis-3 definitions [^115EQsJt]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

The Sepsis-3 definitions, which require the presence of organ dysfunction to define sepsis, may hinder awareness of the importance of early recognition and treatment of infections before organ dysfunction appears. This approach de-emphasizes intervention at earlier stages when treatment is most effective. Ideally, patients at risk for sepsis should be identified before organ dysfunction is established. Therefore, it is questionable if it is beneficial to have a definition that recognizes a patient only once organ dysfunction has occurred, requiring intensive care.

An observational study conducted across 132 medical institutions worldwide over a 4-month period enrolled 4,533 patients to validate a predictive score for patients with intra-abdominal infections. Data from the WSES cIAIs Score Study (WISS) showed that mortality rates were significantly impacted by the previous sepsis definition. Mortality was 1.2% with no sepsis, 4.4% with sepsis, 27.8% with severe sepsis, and 67.8% with septic shock. The severity of illness and inherent mortality risk escalated from no sepsis through sepsis, severe sepsis, and septic shock.

The previous stratification of the severity and consequent mortality due to infection, which progressed from no sepsis to sepsis (infection meeting the criteria for systemic inflammatory response syndrome or SIRS), to severe sepsis (sepsis with organ failure, arterial hypertension, and/or hypoperfusion), to septic shock (arterial hypotension refractory to adequate volume resuscitation) is now reduced to simple infection and sepsis (infection and organ dysfunction).

### Infectious diseases society of America (IDSA) position statement: Why IDSA did not endorse the Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines [^116FQvVP]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) did not endorse the 2016 Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines despite being represented in the working group that drafted the guidelines document. Leadership from the IDSA, the Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines, and the Society of Critical Care Medicine engaged in numerous amicable discussions, primarily concerning the bolded, rated guidelines recommendations. However, our societies had different perspectives regarding the interpretation of the major studies that informed the guidelines' recommendations. This divergence in interpretation led to different conclusions and perspectives on the recommendations.

Consequently, the IDSA elected not to endorse the guidelines. Nonetheless, the IDSA hopes to continue collaborating with the Surviving Sepsis Campaign and the Society of Critical Care Medicine to resolve these differences. Together, we aim to develop further strategies to prevent sepsis and septic shock and to reduce death and disability from these conditions both nationally and globally.

### Sepsis: Key insights, future directions, and immediate goals. A review and expert opinion [^117D2nTa]. Intensive Care Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

This review explores the landscape and evolving understanding of sepsis, highlighting both challenges and future directions. Sepsis remains a major global health burden, with diverse clinical presentations complicating timely diagnosis and management. Existing definitions, including the Sepsis-3 criteria, emphasize the importance of organ dysfunction; yet early sepsis detection remains limited by available tools. The Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, though widely used, may not fully capture early stages of infection or account for complex presentations like noncatecholamine-resistant shock.

Additionally, the review underscores the pressing need for standardized terminology across sepsis and shock characterization to ensure consistency in diagnosis and treatment strategies. Accessible, resource-adapted solutions are particularly crucial in low- and middle-income countries where sepsis-related mortality rates are higher due to limited resources.

Future research should focus on developing and validating integrated, multi-parameter tools that combine clinical, biochemical, and microbiological data to improve sepsis outcomes globally. Advancing sepsis care will require both technological innovation and collaborative, globally consistent guidelines to bridge disparities in healthcare delivery.

### Surviving sepsis campaign: International guidelines for management of sepsis and septic shock: 2016 [^112JPJMT]. Intensive Care Medicine (2017). High credibility.

To update the "Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines for Management of Sepsis and Septic Shock: 2012", a consensus committee of 55 international experts representing 25 organizations was convened. Key meetings and a formal conflict-of-interest policy were part of the process. A stand-alone meeting took place in December 2015, and discussions continued through teleconferences and electronic communications.

The panel was divided into five sections: hemodynamics, infection, adjunctive therapies, metabolic interventions, and ventilation. They reviewed and updated population, intervention, comparison, and outcomes (PICO) questions and generated evidence profiles. Each subgroup formulated questions, searched for the best available evidence, and used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system to assess evidence quality from high to very low. Recommendations were then categorized as strong, weak, or best practice statements.

The guideline panel provided 93 statements on managing and resuscitating patients with sepsis or septic shock. Among these, 32 were strong recommendations, 39 were weak, and 18 were best-practice statements. No recommendation was made for four areas.

### Long-term outcome and quality-adjusted life years after severe sepsis [^114Hsrx5]. Critical Care Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to assess long-term mortality, quality of life (QOL), quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and costs per QALY in an unselected ICU patient population with severe sepsis.

- **Design**: This was a prospective observational cohort study.

- **Setting**: The study was conducted across 24 ICUs in Finland.

- **Patients**: The cohort comprised 470 adult patients with severe sepsis treated in ICUs between November 1, 2004, and February 28, 2005. Quality of life before critical illness was assessed in 252 patients, and QOL after severe sepsis was measured in 156 patients (accounting for 58% of the patients surviving by April 30, 2006). Ninety-eight patients responded to both questionnaires. QOL was evaluated using the generic EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D) measurement with summary index (EQsum) and visual analogue scale (VAS).

- **Measurements and main results**: The two-year mortality rate post-severe sepsis was 44.9% (211 out of 470 patients). The median time for QOL assessment following severe sepsis was 17 months (interquartile range [IQR] 16–18). The median EQsum was 75 (IQR 56–92) and EQ VAS was 66 (IQR 50–80), both significantly lower than age- and sex-adjusted reference values (p < 0.001 for both). The decrease between the mean EQsum reference value and severe sepsis patients was 12 (95% confidence interval, 9–16). The difference between the mean EQ VAS reference values and the mean EQ VAS was 8 (95% CI, 5–11). The mean calculated QALYs after severe sepsis were 10.9 (95% CI, 9.7–12.1), and the calculated cost for one QALY was only €2139 for all survivors and nonsurvivors.

- **Conclusions**: The two-year mortality following severe sepsis was high, at 44.9%.

### Comment on "Surviving Sepsis Campaign: International guidelines for management of severe sepsis and septic shock: 2008" by Dellinger et al [^116skvWv]. Intensive Care Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

In conclusion, the revised SSC guidelines have certainly been improved by the use of the GRADE system to classify the strength of the recommendations. However, a strong recommendation in favor of the use of SDD should have been implemented. The strong recommendations in favor of stress ulcer prophylaxis and glucose control are not in line with evidence.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for sepsis and septic shock, specifically in relation to hospital discharge, the SSC 2021 guidelines recommend considering the provision of written and verbal sepsis education for adult patients with sepsis or septic shock and their families. This education should cover diagnosis, treatment, post-ICU, and post-sepsis syndrome, and should be provided before hospital discharge and during follow-up.

### Raising concerns about the sepsis-3 definitions [^113faCoX]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

The definition of sepsis has shifted over time. Systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), sepsis, severe sepsis, and septic shock were initially defined in 1991 by a consensus panel convened by the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) and the Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM). The panel defined sepsis as a systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) due to infection. "Severe" sepsis was defined as sepsis associated with organ dysfunction, hypoperfusion, or hypotension, and "septic shock" was defined as sepsis with arterial hypotension despite adequate fluid resuscitation.

The definitions were revisited in 2001 during the International Sepsis Definitions Conference, which included members from the ACCP, the SCCM, the American Thoracic Society (ATS), the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine (ESICM), and the Surgical Infection Society (SIS). The consensus retained the definitions of sepsis as SIRS due to infection (presumed or confirmed) and severe sepsis as sepsis associated with acute organ dysfunction. However, the criteria defining SIRS were greatly expanded from the 1991 original, and organ dysfunction variables indicative of severe sepsis were also defined. This new set of sepsis criteria changed the diagnostic requirement from "more than 1" of the original 4 to "some" of the expanded list.

In February 2016, the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) published a proposal for new definitions and criteria for sepsis, called Sepsis-3, updating previous sepsis definitions.

### Operationalizing appropriate sepsis definitions in children worldwide: Considerations for the Pediatric Sepsis Definition Taskforce [^111RsxNd]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Subsequent to the wide uptake of adult data-driven Sepsis-3 criteria, it is important to address the practical challenges in developing pediatric sepsis criteria which capture manifestations of illness in a range of settings and with vastly different etiologies and underlying mechanisms. The criteria will need to be unambiguous yet flexible, capable of adapting to the widely different contexts in which children with suspected infections are present around the globe. These criteria should facilitate early recognition of patients at risk, improved diagnosis, and risk stratification to enable timely escalation of treatment to prevent progression. At the same time, we must endeavor to avoid the problems associated with overdiagnosis and treatment.

In summary, there are challenges and opportunities in operationalizing sepsis in the global and diverse settings in which children present; however, we present potential actionable solutions that can be applied locally to identify, manage, and study children with sepsis.

### Impact of the surviving Sepsis Campaign on the recognition and management of severe sepsis in the emergency department: Are we failing [^1112gT8q]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Severe sepsis/septic shock (SS/SS) has a high mortality rate. Over the past decade, there has been a concerted international effort to tackle this problem through the Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC). However, bundle delivery remains problematic. In 2009, the College of Emergency Medicine (CEM) established guidelines for the management of SS/SS. These set the standards for this audit.

- **Objectives**: To assess the recognition and management of patients presenting with SS/SS across three emergency departments (EDs) within the West Midlands.

- **Methods**: Data were collected retrospectively over a 3-month period. Patients in the ED with a diagnostic code of, or presenting complaint suggestive of, sepsis had their scanned notes assessed for evidence of SS/SS. Compliance with the CEM guidelines and evidence of referral to intensive care staff were evaluated.

- **Results**: A total of 255 patients with SS/SS were identified. Of these, 17% (44/255) were documented as septic by ED staff. The CEM standard of care was received in 41% of those with a documented diagnosis of severe sepsis in the ED, and 23% of patients with SS/SS overall. Notably, 89% of patients received the 'treatment' aspects of care, which included oxygen, IV antibiotics, and IV fluids. Twelve patients with a raised lactate level and normal blood pressure (cryptic shock) failed to receive fluid resuscitation. Furthermore, 71% of patients with SS/SS had no documented discussion or consideration of referral to the intensive care unit.

- **Conclusions**: The SSC has had some impact; however, there remains a significant way to go. It is assumed that the picture is similar in EDs across various regions.

### A comparison of different scores for diagnosis and mortality prediction of adults with sepsis in low-and-middle-income countries: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113Rs6ti]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Low credibility.

Sepsis is defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection; it is responsible for twenty percent of all-cause global mortality, the majority of which occurs in low-and-middle-income countries (LMICs).

Sepsis is a syndrome that can manifest in affected patients as a broad constellation of symptoms and signs caused by the interplay of pathogens and host factors. To address the challenge of sepsis diagnosis, multiple sepsis diagnostic and mortality prediction models or scores have been developed.

The availability of sophisticated laboratory investigation tools and early warning scores are important instruments to improve diagnosis and management of sepsis in high-income countries (HICs), but applying those to LMIC settings is complex. The first early warning score published in 1997 was designed to enable detection of changes in illness severity using aberrations in vital signs. In 2001, the Modified Early Warning Score (MEWS) was published. It was created by assigning weighted scores to five physiological parameters (systolic blood pressure, pulse rate, respiratory rate, temperature, and level of consciousness) based on the severity of the abnormality. Though not specific for sepsis, MEWS is intended to support medical staff in anticipating patients' clinical deterioration.

Sepsis definitions have been modified significantly between 1991 and 2016. The definition describes sepsis as organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. For clinical operationalization, organ dysfunction is represented through various scoring systems.

### Validation of the new sepsis-3 definitions: Proposal for improvement in early risk identification [^112K4J4E]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2017). Low credibility.

The Sepsis-3 definitions have sparked debate regarding their broad applicability. The Sepsis-3 Task Force emphasized the need for validation, particularly focusing on the quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) score. This study was conducted in a prospective cohort within a different healthcare setting.

- **Methods**: Patients with infections and at least two signs of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) were analyzed. Sepsis was determined by a total SOFA score of ≥ 2 outside the intensive care unit (ICU) or an increase of ICU admission SOFA by ≥ 2. The main endpoints were the sensitivity of qSOFA outside the ICU, and the sepsis definition both outside and within the ICU, in predicting mortality.

- **Results**: A total of 3,346 infections outside the ICU and 1,058 infections within the ICU were analyzed. Outside the ICU, mortality rates for patients with ≥ 2 SIRS and qSOFA ≥ 2 were 25.3% and 41.2% (p < 0.0001), respectively. The sensitivities of qSOFA and the sepsis definition to predict death were 60.8% and 87.2%, respectively, with the latter being 95.9% within the ICU. The sensitivity of qSOFA and ≥ 3 SIRS criteria for organ dysfunction outside the ICU was 48.7% and 72.5%, respectively (p < 0.0001). Misclassification into stages of lower severity outside the ICU using the 1991 and Sepsis-3 definitions was 21.4% and 3.7%, respectively (p < 0.0001), and 14.9% and 3.7%, respectively, within the ICU (p < 0.0001). Incorporating arterial pH ≤ 7.30 to qSOFA increased sensitivity for death prediction to 67.5% (p 0.004).

- **Conclusions**: Our analysis positively validated the use of the SOFA score to predict unfavorable outcomes and limit misclassification.

### Raising concerns about the sepsis-3 definitions [^116P7RyS]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Sepsis was previously defined as a systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) in a patient with an infection, but it now reflects a significantly greater degree of illness characterized by organ dysfunction, de-emphasizing intervention at earlier stages when it is most treatable. The definition of organ failure based on a SOFA score of ≥ 2 may be accurate and safe in the ICU. However, reliance on the SOFA score can make it more challenging to diagnose a patient with sepsis outside the ICU environment.

The SOFA score is not globally accessible and is not well known by emergency or ward healthcare professionals. Additionally, its applicability is complex outside the ICU as it might demand the calculation of SOFA for subsequent days to verify if the patients fulfill the strict criteria and require laboratory tests.

The qSOFA is a tool for risk stratification, and it seems necessary to look for options to improve its low sensitivity. Until then, SIRS will still be helpful as a screening tool in the emergency department (ED) to identify patients with infections who will most likely benefit from earlier and more aggressive interventions. Clinicians should keep in mind the difference between a screening tool and a risk-stratification tool. A screening tool aims to identify patients with a particular disease from a larger pool of patients. Once these patients are identified, a risk-stratification tool can be applied to determine their likelihood of meeting a particular outcome.

We probably still need a good screening tool to identify patients at risk of developing organ dysfunction. However, this is not addressed in the current discussion.

### Revising sepsis definitions to better target and tailor sepsis care [^112HH8jE]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). High credibility.

How we define sepsis has significant implications for clinical care, quality improvement, and regulatory policies. Sepsis criteria identify heterogenous patients that vary widely in their clinical syndromes, triggering pathogens, and prognoses; one-third have viral or non-infectious processes and crude mortality rates vary 30-fold. Nonetheless, clinicians have been trained to treat all patients with possible sepsis immediately, aggressively, and uniformly with broad-spectrum antibiotics. Evidence continues to mount, however, that immediate antibiotics are critical for patients with septic shock or multiorgan dysfunction, but short delays can safely be tolerated by patients with single organ dysfunction without shock. This allows time to clarify whether these patients are infected or not. We suggest modifying sepsis operational definitions to flag just those patients in whom short antibiotic delays are associated with worse outcomes. This will help focus sepsis care where it is needed, aid antibiotic stewardship, and increase the validity of sepsis quality measures.

### Surviving sepsis campaign: International guidelines for management of severe sepsis and septic shock: 2012 [^114qFyMu]. Critical Care Medicine (2013). High credibility.

To provide an update to the "Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines for Management of Severe Sepsis and Septic Shock", last published in 2008, a consensus committee of 68 international experts representing 30 international organizations was convened. Nominal groups were assembled at key international meetings for attending committee members. A formal conflict of interest policy was developed at the onset of the process and enforced throughout. The entire guidelines process was conducted independently of any industry funding. A stand-alone meeting was held for all subgroup heads, co- and vice-chairs, and selected individuals. Teleconferences and electronic-based discussions among subgroups and the entire committee served as an integral part of the development.

The authors were advised to follow the principles of the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system to guide assessment of quality of evidence from high (A) to very low (D), and to determine the strength of recommendations as strong (1) or weak (2). The potential drawbacks of making strong recommendations in the presence of low-quality evidence were emphasized. Some recommendations were ungraded (UG). Recommendations were classified into three groups: those directly targeting severe sepsis, those targeting general care of the critically ill patient and considered high priority in severe sepsis, and pediatric considerations.

Key recommendations and suggestions, listed by category, include early quantitative resuscitation of patients with severe sepsis and septic shock. Additional results and suggestions detailed in the guidelines provide a comprehensive framework for managing severe sepsis and septic shock.

### New method of classifying infections in critically ill patients [^117KLSjF]. Critical Care Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

To develop a systematic classification describing the contribution made by infection to the outcome from sepsis, we conducted research within the context of the emergence of effective therapies for sepsis. The accurate methods of risk assessment have become increasingly important. Although well-validated instruments exist for assessing risk factors in the host, the contribution made by the infection itself is less well served.

A systematic literature review of the English language publications from the past 30 years was undertaken, focusing on studies describing the outcomes of infections categorized by micro-organism and site of infection. We surveyed 510 published articles that included 55,854 clinical infections. Specific risk codes were generated for bacteremia, meningitis, pneumonia, skin and soft tissue infections, peritonitis, and urinary tract infections. The nature of the organisms and the site of infection significantly impact survival from sepsis, with a notable interaction between them.

This research describes a novel approach that may permit a better assessment of the contribution made by the infection to mortality in patients with sepsis or septic shock.

Over the last 100 years, huge advances have been made in the field of sepsis in terms of pathophysiology, epidemiology, diagnosis, monitoring, and therapeutics. Here, we offer our perspective on the key changes and situations in each of these areas. Despite these changes, mortality rates remain unacceptably high, and continued progress, particularly in early diagnosis and therapy, is urgently needed.

### Is worsening multiple organ failure the cause of death in patients with severe sepsis [^116e5mp7]. Critical Care Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

We used the INDEPTH (International Integrated Database for the Evaluation of Severe Sepsis and Drotrecogin alfa activated) database to investigate the reported cause of death in patients with severe sepsis. Although the mortality of severe sepsis is easily quantified, the actual cause and timing of death are less defined.

- **Design**: Retrospective database analysis.

- **Patients**: Data from 4459 patients with severe sepsis (drotrecogin alfa activated, n = 3228; placebo, n = 1231) were included in five clinical trials conducted in tertiary care institutions across 28 countries.

- **Measurements and main results**: We examined the cause of death and the pattern of Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores near the time of death. We also evaluated the time course of biomarker levels at this late stage. A total of 1201 (27.0%) patients died during the 28-day study period. The main causes of death were sepsis-associated multiple organ failure (43.1%), refractory septic shock (22.6%), and respiratory failure (13.0%). There were no significant differences in the distributions of cause of death between drotrecogin alfa activated and placebo patients, so all patients were combined for analysis. The mean cardiovascular Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score increased from 2.4, four days before death, to 2.9, one day before death, and the mean respiratory Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score increased from 2.6, four days before death, to 2.9, one day before death. The increase in these individual Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores was more prominent.

### Pitfalls in the treatment of sepsis [^111uunSK]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Sepsis is a challenging and dynamic pathophysiology requiring expertise in both diagnosis and management. Controversy exists as to the most sensitive early indicators of sepsis and its severity. Patients presenting to the emergency department often lack a complete history or clinical data that would point to optimal management. Awareness of these potential knowledge gaps is important for the emergency provider managing the septic patient. Specific areas of management, including the initiation and management of mechanical ventilation, the appropriate disposition of the patient, and consideration of transfer to higher levels of care, are reviewed.

### Sepsis subclasses: A framework for development and interpretation [^1121f4tW]. Critical Care Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Sepsis is defined as a dysregulated host response to infection that leads to life-threatening acute organ dysfunction. It afflicts approximately 50 million people worldwide annually and is often deadly, even when evidence-based guidelines are applied promptly. Many randomized trials have tested therapies for sepsis over the past two decades, but most have not proven beneficial. This may be because sepsis is a heterogeneous syndrome, characterized by a vast set of clinical and biological features. Combinations of these features may identify previously unrecognized groups or "subclasses" with different risks of outcome and response to a given treatment.

As efforts to identify sepsis subclasses become more common, many unanswered questions and challenges arise. These include:

- **Semantic underpinning**: The semantic underpinning of sepsis subclasses.
- **Conceptual goal**: The conceptual goal of subclasses.
- **Study considerations**: Considerations about study design, data sources, and statistical methods.
- **Emerging data types**: The role of emerging data types.
- **Truth representation**: How to determine whether subclasses represent "truth".

We discuss these challenges and present a framework for the broader study of sepsis subclasses. This framework is intended to aid in the understanding and interpretation of sepsis subclasses, provide a mechanism for explaining subclasses generated by different methodological approaches, and guide clinicians on how to consider subclasses in bedside care.

### A framework for the development and interpretation of different sepsis definitions and clinical criteria [^115JiwrE]. Critical Care Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Although sepsis was described more than 2,000 years ago, clinicians still struggle to define it accurately due to the absence of a "gold standard" and the existence of multiple competing approaches and terms. Challenges include the evolving knowledge base that informs our understanding of sepsis, differing opinions on which aspects of any potential definition are most important, and the distribution of most potential criteria in at-risk populations that hinders their separation into discrete patient sets.

The development and evaluation of any sepsis definition or diagnostic criteria should follow these 4 steps:

- **Define the epistemologic underpinning**: Establish the foundational knowledge and assumptions.
- **Agree on all relevant terms**: Ensure consensus on the terminology used throughout the process.
- **State the intended purpose**: Clearly define the objectives for any proposed set of criteria.
- **Adopt a scientific approach**: Ensure that the approach informs the usefulness of the criteria in relation to the intended purpose.

Usefulness can be measured across six domains:

- **Reliability**: Assess the stability of criteria during retesting, between different raters, over time, and across various settings.
- **Content validity**: Ensure that criteria appear to measure what they are supposed to measure.
- **Construct validity**: Verify whether the criteria truly assess the concept they intend to measure.
- **Criterion validity**: Evaluate how the new criteria compare to existing standards.
- **Measurement burden**: Consider cost, safety, and complexity.
- **Timeliness**: Determine if the criteria are available concurrent with care decisions.

The relative importance of these domains depends on the intended purpose, which can broadly be categorized into four areas: clinical care, research, surveillance, and quality improvement and audit.

### Operationalizing appropriate sepsis definitions in children worldwide: Considerations for the Pediatric Sepsis Definition Taskforce [^111fhrDL]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2023). Low credibility.

Sepsis varies in its clinical manifestations over time, which necessitates different requirements for identification across the various stages of its progression. In the early phases, clinicians may have limited information available but require criteria to make a presumptive diagnosis sufficient to implement effective therapeutic approaches. At later stages, clinicians usually have access to substantive information, including results of diagnostic testing, clinical progression, and response to therapy, to allow a definitive diagnosis. This concept enables clinicians to consider parameters for the early initiation of antibiotic therapy while allowing early termination of antibiotic therapy once additional information allows for reevaluation of the diagnosis and risk. To ensure widespread adoption and patient benefit, criteria for sepsis should correlate with clinically relevant intervention points, such as invasive bacterial infection requiring antibiotic therapy and organ dysfunction necessitating organ support therapy, as well as the risk of mortality in each situation.

Sepsis represents a broad umbrella term covering a condition that may be caused by a wide range of pathogens, including bacterial, viral, fungal, and parasitic. There are no simple and unambiguous clinical, biological, imaging, or laboratory features that uniquely identify a patient with sepsis. The lack of rapid and reliable sepsis tests hampers the ability to make a definitive diagnosis of life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection at the time of presentation.

### Defining and diagnosing sepsis [^1139SkNw]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Sepsis is a heterogeneous clinical syndrome that encompasses infections of many different types and severity. Not surprisingly, it has confounded most attempts to apply a single definition, which has also limited the ability to develop a set of reliable diagnostic criteria. It is perhaps best defined as the different clinical syndromes produced by an immune response to infection that causes harm to the body beyond that of the local effects of the infection.

The objective of the guidelines is to provide an update to the "Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines for Management of Sepsis and Septic Shock: 2012".

- **Design**: A consensus committee of 55 international experts representing 25 international organizations was convened. Nominal groups were assembled at key international meetings for those committee members attending the conference. A formal conflict-of-interest (COI) policy was developed at the onset of the process and enforced throughout. A stand-alone meeting was held for all panel members in December 2015. Teleconferences and electronic-based discussions among subgroups and the entire committee served as integral parts of the development.

- **Methods**: The panel consisted of five sections: hemodynamics, infection, adjunctive therapies, metabolic, and ventilation. Population, intervention, comparison, and outcomes (PICO) questions were reviewed and updated as needed, and evidence profiles were generated. Each subgroup generated a list of questions, searched for the best available evidence, and followed the principles of the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system to assess the quality of evidence from high to very low, and to formulate recommendations as strong or weak, or best practice statements when applicable.

- **Results**: The Surviving Sepsis Guideline panel provided 93 statements on the early management and resuscitation of patients with sepsis or septic shock. Overall, 32 were strong recommendations, 39 were weak recommendations, and 18 were best-practice statements. No recommendation was provided for four instances.

### Trends in the epidemiology of pediatric severe sepsis [^114Nr241]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

In the past decade, guidelines have been developed for the early detection and management of severe sepsis in children and neonates. However, severe sepsis continues to be a significant U.S. healthcare problem, accounting for over 720,000 annual hospitalizations. Large-scale epidemiologic studies of severe sepsis continue to be limited, particularly in children. We present data from 1995, 2000, and 2005 in seven U.S. states, examining how case mix, outcome, and resource use for pediatric severe sepsis have changed over time.

- **Design**: We constructed a database including all acute-care hospitalizations for children in the seven states. For each case, we extracted data on demographic characteristics; the principal diagnosis, up to six secondary diagnoses, and six procedures as classified by the International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification codes; and in-hospital fatality. We identified patients with severe sepsis using International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification codes for both infection and acute organ failure.

- **Setting**: Retrospective observational cohort dataset from seven U.S. states from 1995, 2000, and 2005.

- **Subjects**: Children in the U.S. aged 0–19 years.

- **Interventions**: None.

- **Measurements and main results**: In 2005, 17,542 children were hospitalized with severe sepsis in the seven states; there was an 81% increase in pediatric severe sepsis cases since 1995 and a 45% increase since 2000. This corresponded to an increase in prevalence from 0.56 to 0.89 cases per 1,000 pediatric population.

### Beyond septic shock: who else requires immediate antibiotics [^1175TafH]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

This valuable study highlights the complexity of sepsis. Sepsis is not a discrete disease or a one-size-fits-all syndrome. It is a complicated mosaic of diseases with protean manifestations in diverse patients. Our tools to differentiate these conditions are crude, particularly in real time at the bedside. This study and others suggest that there is ample room, and clinical necessity, to add more nuance to how we risk-stratify and manage patients with suspected sepsis.

Patients with septic shock should continue to be prioritized for immediate treatment. Additional populations, such as those with metastatic cancer or at least three organ failures, may also benefit from earlier antibiotic treatment. Most importantly, the study by Hechtman and colleagues emphasizes the need to refine our understanding of which combinations of host factors, comorbidities, clinical presentations, illness severity, and pathogens are most likely to benefit from early broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment. Additionally, it underscores the necessity of identifying combinations that may indicate an increased risk of harm from immediate antibiotic treatment. Developing tools for clinicians to better differentiate between these phenotypes in real time at the bedside is essential.

### Surviving sepsis campaign: International guidelines for management of sepsis and septic shock 2021 [^113RMzNh]. Intensive Care Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Regarding surgical interventions for sepsis and septic shock, specifically concerning source control, the SSC 2021 guidelines recommend rapidly identifying or excluding a specific anatomical diagnosis of infection that requires emergent source control. It further advises implementing any necessary source control interventions as soon as medically and logistically feasible in adult patients with sepsis or septic shock.

### Organ dysfunction during sepsis [^117BhT86]. Intensive Care Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome is the most common reason for sepsis-associated mortality.

In the 40 years since it was first described, understanding of its pathophysiology has improved. Novel methodologies for monitoring and severity of illness scoring have emerged. These, together with the development of systematic strategies for managing organ dysfunction in sepsis and potentially effective new therapeutic interventions, should assist in reducing sepsis-associated mortality.

Historical developments are discussed, and the reader is directed to these references for further guidance.

### Surviving sepsis campaign: International guidelines for management of severe sepsis and septic shock, 2012 [^114zHw6V]. Intensive Care Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

To provide an update to the "Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines for Management of Severe Sepsis and Septic Shock", last published in 2008, a consensus committee of 68 international experts representing 30 organizations was convened. Nominal groups were assembled at key international meetings for committee members attending the conference. A formal conflict of interest policy was developed at the onset and enforced throughout. The guidelines process was conducted independently of any industry funding. A stand-alone meeting was held for all subgroup heads, co-chairs, vice-chairs, and selected individuals. Teleconferences and electronic discussions among subgroups and the entire committee were integral to the development.

The authors were advised to follow the principles of the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system. This approach guided the assessment of quality of evidence from high (A) to very low (D) and the determination of the strength of recommendations as strong (1) or weak (2). The potential drawbacks of making strong recommendations in the presence of low-quality evidence were emphasized. Recommendations were classified into three groups: those directly targeting severe sepsis, those targeting general care of the critically ill patient and considered high priority in severe sepsis, and pediatric considerations.

Key recommendations and suggestions include early quantitative resuscitation of the septic patient during…

### Definitions and pathophysiology of sepsis [^112XPrZq]. Current Problems in Pediatric and Adolescent Health Care (2013). Low credibility.

Mortality rates for sepsis and septic shock have not improved in the past decade. The Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) guidelines released in 2012 emphasize early recognition and treatment of sepsis, in an effort to reduce the burden of sepsis worldwide. This series of review articles will discuss the pathophysiology of sepsis; comorbidities, such as multiorgan dysfunction syndrome (MODS), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and endocrine issues; and finally, management of sepsis and septic shock.

### A retrospective review of the sepsis definition after publication of Sepsis-3 [^113DeioC]. The American Journal of Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Two and a half years after the introduction of Sepsis-3, clinicians continue not to document Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores. There continue to be variations in what standard is accepted by both commercial payers and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) in diagnosing sepsis. The purpose of this review is to determine if the Third International Consensus Definitions for Sepsis and Septic Shock (Sepsis-3) were being utilized in defining sepsis in the clinical setting.

- **Methods**: One hundred patients between February 2016 and March 2018 who were diagnosed with sepsis were retrospectively reviewed for the presence of criteria for the diagnosis of sepsis. Data points for SOFA criteria were analyzed.

- **Results**: None of the septic patients were diagnosed utilizing SOFA scores. Many of the data points were found to not have been collected or measured to complete a SOFA score.

- **Conclusions**: Due to Sepsis-3 criteria not being accepted by CMS or the Infectious Disease Society of America, along with it not being able to be operationalized for use in the clinical setting, it is recommended to continue utilizing systemic inflammatory response syndrome criteria plus infection while Sepsis-3 continues to be evaluated. This will also allow for some time to study any effect it may have on patient outcomes. There is also a need for a uniform definition of sepsis.

### Sepsis and septic shock [^111T4vxG]. Lancet (2018). Low credibility.

Sepsis is a common condition that is associated with unacceptably high mortality and, for many of those who survive, long-term morbidity. Increased awareness of the condition resulting from ongoing campaigns and the evidence arising from research in the past 10 years have increased understanding of this problem among clinicians and lay people, and have led to improved outcomes. The World Health Assembly and WHO made sepsis a global health priority in 2017 and have adopted a resolution to improve the prevention, diagnosis, and management of sepsis.

In 2016, a new definition of sepsis (Sepsis-3) was developed. Sepsis is now defined as infection with organ dysfunction. This definition codifies organ dysfunction using the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score. Ongoing research aims to improve the definition of patient populations to allow for individualized management strategies matched to a patient's molecular and biochemical profile. The search continues for improved diagnostic techniques that can facilitate this aim and for a pharmacological agent that can improve outcomes by modifying the disease process.

While waiting for this goal to be achieved, improved basic care driven by education and quality-improvement programs offers the best hope of increasing favorable outcomes.

### Operationalizing appropriate sepsis definitions in children worldwide: Considerations for the Pediatric Sepsis Definition Taskforce [^114Nb3j3]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Across the world, substantial morbidity, mortality, expense, and adverse impacts on healthcare systems are attributed to pediatric sepsis. Unfortunately, variability in the operationalization of pediatric sepsis definitions leads to difficulties in measuring the burden of sepsis and optimizing management and may compromise quality improvement initiatives. In many settings, "sepsis" has been used synonymously with "severe infection", resulting in substantial challenges and variability in recognition and coding for sepsis. Although Sepsis-3 definitions were intended to unify the various definitions and terminologies, they have some limitations when applied to the global healthcare community, limitations which are even more pronounced when considering pediatric age groups.

There are significant differences in the epidemiology, biology, susceptibility, and approach to sepsis management between adults and children. These differences are magnified between high-income country and upper middle-income country settings compared to low-income country and low middle-income country settings, where the majority of pediatric sepsis occurs.

Sepsis is defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection, but there are no validated measures that determine when a child transitions from having an "infection" to having "sepsis". The purpose of establishing criteria for pediatric sepsis is to support a structured process for the early diagnosis of sepsis and the development of appropriate interventions for that diagnosis.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for sepsis and septic shock, with specific focus on the transition of care, the SSC 2021 guidelines recommend considering longer courses of antimicrobial therapy than the standard duration of 7–10 days. This is advised for patients who exhibit a slow clinical response, have undrainable foci of infection, bacteremia with S. aureus, certain fungal and viral infections, or immunologic deficiencies, including neutropenia.

### Assessment of clinical criteria for sepsis: For the third international consensus definitions for sepsis and septic shock (Sepsis-3) [^112DCACY]. JAMA (2016). Low credibility.

The Third International Consensus Definitions Task Force defined sepsis as "life-threatening organ dysfunction due to a dysregulated host response to infection". The performance of clinical criteria for this sepsis definition is unknown.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the validity of clinical criteria to identify patients with suspected infection who are at risk of sepsis.

Among 1.3 million electronic health record encounters from January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2012, at 12 hospitals in southwestern Pennsylvania, we identified those with suspected infection in whom to compare criteria. Confirmatory analyses were performed in four data sets of 706,399 out-of-hospital and hospital encounters at 165 US and non-US hospitals, ranging from January 1, 2008, until December 31, 2013.

- **Exposures**: Sequential [Sepsis-related] Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria, Logistic Organ Dysfunction System (LODS) score, and a new model derived using multivariable logistic regression in a split sample, the quick Sequential [Sepsis-related] Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) score (range, 0–3 points, with 1 point each for systolic hypotension [≤ 100 mm Hg], tachypnea [≥ 22/min], or altered mentation).

- **Main outcomes and measures**: For construct validity, pairwise agreement was assessed. For predictive validity, the discrimination for outcomes (primary: in-hospital mortality; secondary: in-hospital mortality or intensive care unit [ICU] length of stay ≥ 3 days) more common in sepsis than uncomplicated infection.

### Sepsis: A roadmap for future research [^112eJYYS]. The Lancet Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Sepsis is a common and lethal syndrome; although outcomes have improved, mortality remains high. No specific anti-sepsis treatments exist. As such, management of patients relies mainly on early recognition, allowing correct therapeutic measures to be started rapidly, including the administration of appropriate antibiotics, source control measures when necessary, and resuscitation with intravenous fluids and vasoactive drugs when needed.

Although substantial developments have been made in understanding the basic pathogenesis of sepsis and the complex interplay of host, pathogen, and environment that affect the incidence and course of the disease, sepsis has stubbornly resisted all efforts to successfully develop and then deploy new and improved treatments. Existing models of clinical research seem increasingly unlikely to produce new therapies that will result in a step change in clinical outcomes. In this commission, we set out our understanding of the clinical epidemiology and management of sepsis and then ask how the present approaches might be challenged to develop a new roadmap for future research.

### Global, regional, and national sepsis incidence and mortality, 1990–2017: Analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study [^113FbjAh]. Lancet (2020). Low credibility.

We used GBD 2017 data to produce sepsis estimates consistent with other GBD estimates. By contrast with previous hospital-based approaches, vital registration death records were the primary basis for our estimates because they represent deaths both in and out of the hospital. The use of these records is an essential feature for global sepsis estimates, as much of the sepsis burden could be incurred outside of the hospital, particularly in low-income or middle-income countries. We first estimated sepsis-related mortality using multiple cause-of-death vital registration data and age-specific, sex-specific, location-specific, and cause-specific GBD 2017 estimates for all causes of death worldwide, from 1990 to 2017 (appendix p. 2). We estimated the incidence of sepsis by applying modelled sepsis-related case-fatality from hospital administrative data to mortality estimates (appendix p. 3). We followed the Guidelines for Accurate and Transparent Health Estimates Reporting (GATHER) recommendations.

Sepsis is diagnosed clinically by the presence of acute infection and new organ dysfunction. Unlike the previous idea of septicaemia, which was a non-specific term describing an individual who appeared unwell and had a bloodstream infection, the modern notion of sepsis extends across bacterial, fungal, viral, and parasitic pathogens. It focuses on the host response as the major source of morbidity and mortality, and requires only that infection be suspected rather than proven, in recognition that many cases do not have such confirmation.

### Recognizing and managing sepsis: What needs to be done [^116242hQ]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Sepsis is associated with significant morbidity and mortality if not promptly recognized and treated. Since the development of early goal-directed therapy, mortality rates have decreased, but sepsis remains a major cause of death in patients arriving at the emergency department or staying in the hospital. In this forum article, we asked clinicians and researchers with expertise in sepsis care to discuss the importance of rapid detection and treatment of the condition, as well as special considerations in different patient groups.

### New sepsis and septic shock definitions: Clinical implications and controversies [^115mPnnT]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

The new sepsis definitions shift emphasis from the systemic inflammatory response syndrome to organ dysfunction, quantified using the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score. The new definitions also propose Quick SOFA criteria to rapidly identify potentially infected patients at risk for poor outcomes. The diagnosis of septic shock requires vasopressor dependence and increased lactate levels.

Strengths of these definitions include their simplicity and clear association with adverse outcomes. However, their utility in identifying patients with serious infections before frank sepsis ensues remains to be seen. This article reviews challenges in defining sepsis, strengths and weaknesses of the new definitions, and unresolved issues.

### The surviving sepsis campaign: Results of an international guideline-based performance improvement program targeting severe sepsis [^111q9AYh]. Critical Care Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

The Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC or "the Campaign") developed guidelines for the management of severe sepsis and septic shock. A performance improvement initiative targeted changing clinical behavior (process improvement) via bundles based on key SSC guideline recommendations.

- **Design and setting**: A multifaceted intervention to facilitate compliance with selected guideline recommendations in the intensive care unit, emergency department, and wards of individual hospitals and regional hospital networks was implemented voluntarily in the United States, Europe, and South America. Elements of the guidelines were "bundled" into two sets of targets to be completed within 6 hours and within 24 hours. An analysis was conducted on data submitted from January 2005 through March 2008.

- **Subjects**: A total of 15,022 subjects.

- **Measurements and main results**: Data from 15,022 subjects at 165 sites were analyzed to determine compliance with bundle targets and the association with hospital mortality. Compliance with the entire resuscitation bundle increased linearly from 10.9% in the first site quarter to 31.3% by the end of 2 years (p < .0001). Compliance with the entire management bundle started at 18.4% in the first quarter and increased to 36.1% by the end of 2 years (p = .008). Compliance with all bundle elements increased significantly, except for inspiratory plateau pressure, which was high at baseline. Unadjusted hospital mortality decreased from 37% to 30.8% over 2 years (p = .001). The adjusted odds ratio for mortality improved the longer a site was in the Campaign.

### What's new in sepsis recognition in resource-limited settings [^114djv1k]. Intensive Care Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Sepsis is a life-threatening condition characterized by one or more organ dysfunctions due to a dysregulated host response to infection or, in certain cases, due to direct pathogen effects. It is associated with bacterial or fungal infections, as well as any other infection such as viral diseases, protozoal infections (e.g. malaria), or tropical infections. Although the literature suggests sepsis is predominantly an issue in resource-rich countries, the global burden of acute infections is highest in resource-limited areas. Successful sepsis management relies on various components, among which early recognition is essential. Evidence and recommendations for sepsis recognition are primarily based on research conducted in resource-rich settings. However, resource-rich and resource-limited countries differ in healthcare accessibility and infectious disease epidemiology. Therefore, it is unreasonable to directly translate evidence between these settings.

The Global Intensive Care working group of the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine, together with the Mahidol-Oxford Research Unit, formed an international team of physicians to revise existing recommendations for sepsis management in resource-limited settings. In this manuscript, we summarize recommendations on sepsis recognition. A detailed description of the guideline team, conflicts of interest, methods, rationales, and references is provided in the online supplement.
