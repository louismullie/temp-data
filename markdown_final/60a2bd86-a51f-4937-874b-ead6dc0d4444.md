## Question

What is the correct treatment for an iron saturation of four?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for the correct treatment for a transferrin saturation of 4%. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what a TSAT of 4% signifies pathophysiologically and diagnostically. Then, I should verify when to prioritize intravenous versus oral iron. Next, I will consider disease-specific contexts like CKD, IBD, and heart failure. After that, I need to outline dosing strategies and monitoring. Finally, I should ensure we have a plan for evaluating the underlying cause and for follow-up to prevent recurrence, with attention to areas of guideline disagreement where I must reconcile recommendations thoughtfully.

> Let me first confirm the severity and diagnostic meaning of a TSAT of 4%. A TSAT below 20% is widely used to indicate iron deficiency or iron-restricted erythropoiesis, and a value as low as 4% strongly suggests severe absolute iron deficiency with impaired iron delivery to the marrow, although ferritin remains the primary confirmatory marker in general practice and can be misleading in inflammation, so I need to check ferritin, CBC indices, and inflammatory markers concurrently to avoid false reassurance from a normal or elevated ferritin in inflammatory states [^116DCPpr] [^111sFJG3] [^116cS6G1].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about the treatment route without considering urgency and context. With TSAT at 4%, the likelihood of slow or inadequate repletion with oral iron rises, and multiple guidelines advise early parenteral iron when oral iron is unlikely to be effective, poorly tolerated, malabsorbed, or when rapid correction is needed, so IV iron should generally be preferred here unless the patient is stable, asymptomatic, and highly likely to absorb and tolerate oral therapy [^1115AV6R] [^115DLfwi].

> I will now examine oral iron as a secondary option and specify how to optimize it if chosen. Once-daily low-to-moderate elemental iron or even every-other-day dosing can improve absorption and tolerability by mitigating hepcidin-mediated blockade, so I should confirm dosing in the 60–65 mg elemental iron range per dose rather than high-frequency schedules, and reassess early for response; however, with TSAT 4%, I need to ensure the patient does not have factors predicting poor oral absorption such as active inflammation, celiac disease, or prior bariatric surgery before relying on oral therapy [^1115rbrv] [^115DLfwi] [^116DCPpr].

> Wait, let me verify the vitamin C question because guidance conflicts. The AGA CPU advises adding vitamin C to oral iron to improve absorption, but a large randomized trial summarized in the BSG 2021 guideline found no benefit from co-administered vitamin C in terms of hematologic response or iron loading, so I should acknowledge this discrepancy, discuss it with the patient, and individualize; practically, I can prioritize fasting administration and alternate-day dosing strategies and not insist on vitamin C if tolerance or evidence concerns arise [^115DLfwi] [^1115rbrv].

> Next, I should review practical IV iron choices and dosing. For severe deficiency like TSAT 4%, a total repletion dose of about 1,000–1,500 mg elemental iron is commonly required, which can be delivered as ferric carboxymaltose in one or two infusions depending on weight and local protocols, or as fractionated iron sucrose or ferric gluconate over multiple sessions; I need to confirm product-specific dosing and safety, and I should favor agents that allow complete or near-complete replacement quickly when rapid correction is clinically desirable [^116DCPpr] [^11126u9P].

> But wait, what if the patient has CKD or is on or approaching ESA therapy? In CKD, functional and absolute iron deficiency are frequent, and guidelines and ESA labels consistently recommend ensuring iron repletion when TSAT is below 20% or ferritin is below 100 μg/L, with IV iron generally superior to oral in hemodialysis or in the presence of inflammation; I should monitor iron indices at least every three months during ESA therapy and use the lowest ESA dose needed while avoiding hemoglobin targets above 11 g/dL for safety [^111vEPEQ] [^116xnrbz] [^115jdb58] [^117TVcio] [^115WRUmV].

> I need to consider IBD specifically because inflammation impairs oral absorption and increases hepcidin. In active or complicated IBD, IV iron is typically preferred, with monitoring every three months for the first year after correction and then every 6–12 months; some IBD guidance advises not exceeding 100 mg elemental iron daily when oral is used, and retreatment thresholds after IV repletion often use ferritin below 100 μg/L or recurrent anemia as a trigger for re-dosing [^113iSPQg] [^114k8Tww] [^111PnCGb] [^114KmTai].

> Let me think about heart failure, because TSAT 4% is particularly relevant. Oral iron failed to improve functional capacity in HFrEF in IRONOUT-HF, whereas meta-analytic data suggest IV iron reduces heart failure events primarily in patients with TSAT below 20%, with the magnitude of benefit increasing as hypoferremia worsens; thus, with TSAT 4%, IV iron is favored over oral in symptomatic HFrEF patients, assuming no contraindication [^1161Q38A] [^111Ws2Lt].

> Next, I should review perioperative and urgent scenarios. For patients with symptomatic anemia, preoperative timelines, or active bleeding where rapid correction is necessary, IV iron is preferred and may require 1–2 weeks for maximal effect, while RBC transfusion is reserved for hemodynamic instability or severe symptomatic anemia and should be followed by iron repletion since transfusion does not correct the deficit in iron stores [^1128uafv] [^1115AV6R] [^114wkrGu].

> I need to ensure we investigate the cause of such profound deficiency rather than only replete iron. Adults with confirmed IDA generally warrant bidirectional endoscopy, with specific recommendations for asymptomatic men and postmenopausal women, and selective consideration even in asymptomatic premenopausal women; I also should screen for celiac disease and avoid delaying iron therapy while investigations proceed unless colonoscopy is imminent, balancing the need for timely repletion with diagnostic yield [^113dWhbk] [^111Vh7AK] [^116JMk3z] [^1114eHoJ].

> Hold on, I should verify monitoring intervals and switch criteria. A practical approach is to check hemoglobin within 2–4 weeks of starting therapy to confirm an early response, expecting a rise of about 10 g/L within two weeks on effective oral therapy; if response is inadequate, I should switch to IV iron rather than escalating oral doses, and after IV iron I should wait at least four weeks before reassessing ferritin and TSAT to avoid falsely elevated readings from recent infusion [^116DCPpr] [^114wkrGu] [^117W6VWK].

> I will now outline duration and maintenance. Therapy should continue for approximately three months after hemoglobin normalization to replete stores, with periodic surveillance thereafter in high-risk groups like IBD and CKD to detect recurrence early and to re-treat promptly if ferritin falls or TSAT again drops below 20% in the appropriate clinical context [^116UwsGD] [^111PnCGb] [^111vEPEQ].

> Finally, let me synthesize the recommendation and double-check for internal consistency. With TSAT of 4%, IV iron is the recommended initial strategy in most scenarios because of the severity of iron-restricted erythropoiesis, the need for reliable and rapid repletion, and the high likelihood of oral ineffectiveness in inflammatory states; oral iron can be reserved for stable, asymptomatic patients without inflammatory or malabsorptive conditions, using once-daily or alternate-day dosing with early reassessment and a low threshold to switch to IV if hemoglobin fails to rise as expected [^116UwsGD] [^115DLfwi] [^1115rbrv].

An iron saturation of 4% indicates **severe iron deficiency** and requires prompt treatment. The correct approach is to **start oral iron** (ferrous sulfate 325 mg once daily or every other day) if tolerated, and switch to intravenous iron if oral therapy is not tolerated, ineffective, or if rapid correction is needed [^115DLfwi] [^116DCPpr]. Concurrently, identify and treat the underlying cause, and monitor hemoglobin and iron indices every 2–4 weeks [^115bHVQo] until normalization, then every 3–6 months to prevent recurrence.

---

## Clinical significance of iron saturation at 4%

Iron saturation (transferrin saturation, TSAT) reflects the proportion of transferrin bound to iron; the normal range is 20–50%. A TSAT of 4% is **severely low**, signifying minimal circulating iron available for erythropoiesis and consistent with severe iron deficiency anemia (IDA).

---

## Initial diagnostic evaluation

Before initiating therapy, **confirm iron deficiency and exclude other causes of anemia**:

- **Confirm iron deficiency**: Low ferritin, low serum iron, high TIBC, low TSAT [^1149wkcb] [^111sFJG3].
- **Exclude other causes**: Vitamin B12/folate deficiency, chronic inflammation, hemolysis, bone marrow disorders [^111sFJG3].
- **Identify underlying causes**: Chronic blood loss (GI, menstrual), malabsorption (celiac, IBD), dietary insufficiency, chronic disease [^111sFJG3] [^112kPXcV].

---

## Recommended treatment strategies

### Oral iron therapy (first-line)

Oral iron is **first-line** because of its efficacy, safety, and cost [^115DLfwi]. Ferrous sulfate 325 mg (65 mg elemental) once daily or every other day is recommended; alternate-day dosing can improve absorption and tolerability [^115DLfwi] [^1115rbrv]. Continue for approximately 3 months after Hb normalization to replete stores [^116DCPpr].

---

### Intravenous iron therapy (second-line)

IV iron is **indicated** when oral iron is not tolerated, ineffective, or rapid correction is needed (e.g. severe anemia, ongoing blood loss, malabsorption, CKD, IBD) [^115DLfwi] [^116DCPpr]. Common formulations include ferric carboxymaltose, iron sucrose, and ferric derisomaltose; dosing is individualized based on weight, Hb, and iron deficit.

---

### Red blood cell transfusion (reserved)

Transfusion is **reserved** for severe symptomatic anemia or hemodynamic instability. It provides temporary relief but does not correct iron deficiency; thus, iron therapy is still required [^114wkrGu] [^116DCPpr].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular **monitoring** to assess response and prevent recurrence includes checking hemoglobin at 2–4 weeks; a rise of ≥ 10 g/L at 2 weeks predicts success [^115bHVQo]. Recheck ferritin and TSAT after 4 weeks of therapy [^117W6VWK], then monitor every 3–6 months after correction to detect recurrence.

---

## Addressing underlying causes

Identifying and treating the **cause** is critical to preventing recurrence:

- **Gastrointestinal evaluation**: Upper and lower endoscopy for unexplained IDA, especially in men and postmenopausal women [^116JMk3z] [^113dWhbk].
- **Gynecological evaluation**: Assess and manage menorrhagia or other gynecologic bleeding [^111sFJG3].
- **Malabsorption**: Treat celiac disease, IBD, or other causes [^117GJGKa].
- **Dietary counseling**: Improve iron intake and absorption.

---

## Potential complications of untreated severe iron deficiency

Untreated **severe iron deficiency** can cause:

- **Cardiovascular complications**: Heart failure, arrhythmias, ischemia.
- **Neurological complications**: Cognitive impairment, fatigue, restless legs.
- **Immune dysfunction**: Increased infection risk.
- **Pregnancy complications**: Preterm birth, low birth weight, maternal morbidity [^111sFJG3].

- **Treatment of IDA**:

- **Initiation of iron replacement therapy (IRT)**: We recommend that IRT should not be deferred while awaiting investigations for iron deficiency anemia (IDA) unless colonoscopy is imminent (evidence quality — high, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).

- **Initial treatment**: We recommend that the initial treatment of IDA should be with one tablet per day of ferrous sulphate, fumarate, or gluconate. If not tolerated, a reduced dose of one tablet every other day, alternative oral preparations, or parenteral iron should be considered (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 92%, statement strength — strong).

- **Transfusion considerations**: Limited transfusion of packed red cells may occasionally be required to treat symptomatic IDA, in which case IRT is still necessary post-transfusion (evidence quality — high, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).

- **Monitoring and continuation of treatment**: We recommend that patients should be monitored in the first 4 weeks for a hemoglobin (Hb) response to oral iron, and treatment should be continued for approximately 3 months after normalization of the Hb level to ensure adequate repletion of the marrow iron stores (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 92%, statement strength — strong).

- **Parenteral iron considerations**: We recommend that parenteral iron should be considered when oral iron is contraindicated, ineffective, or not tolerated. This consideration should be at an early stage if oral IRT is judged unlikely to be effective, and/or the correction of IDA is particularly urgent (evidence quality — high, consensus — 92%, statement strength — strong).

- **Invasive investigations**: There is insufficient evidence to support invasive investigation in non-anaemic iron deficiency unless there are additional indications.

Regarding specific circumstances for iron deficiency anemia, particularly in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and the management of recurrence, the 2015 ECCO guidelines recommend initiating re-treatment with intravenous iron as soon as serum ferritin drops below 100 mcg/L or hemoglobin falls below 12–13 g/dL (according to gender) following successful treatment of iron deficiency anemia with intravenous iron.

### Procrit [^116xnrbz]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Important dosing information**: Evaluate the iron status in all patients before and during treatment. Administer supplemental iron therapy when serum ferritin is less than 100 mcg/L or when serum transferrin saturation is less than 20%. The majority of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) will require supplemental iron during the course of erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) therapy.

- **Monitoring of response to therapy**: Correct or exclude other causes of anemia (e.g. vitamin deficiency, metabolic or chronic inflammatory conditions, bleeding) before initiating Procrit. Following initiation of therapy and after each dose adjustment, monitor hemoglobin weekly until the hemoglobin level is stable and sufficient to minimize the need for red blood cell (RBC) transfusion.

- **Selection of formulation**: In pregnant women, lactating women, neonates, and infants, use only single-dose vials (the benzyl alcohol-free formulation) [see Contraindications (4) and Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.2, and 8.4)].

- **Patients with chronic kidney disease**: In controlled trials, patients experienced greater risks for death, serious adverse cardiovascular reactions, and stroke when administered ESAs to target a hemoglobin level of greater than 11 g/dL. No trial has identified a hemoglobin target level, ESA dose, or dosing strategy that does not increase these risks. Individualize dosing and use the lowest dose of Procrit sufficient to reduce the need for RBC transfusions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Physicians and patients should weigh the possible benefits of decreasing transfusions against the increased risks associated with treatment.

### Iron deficiency in chronic pediatric heart failure: Overall assessment and outcomes in dilated cardiomyopathy [^112dFuev]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the frequency of iron status assessment in pediatric heart failure and the prevalence and adverse effects of absolute iron deficiency in dilated cardiomyopathy-induced heart failure.

- **Study design**: We retrospectively reviewed records of children with chronic heart failure at our center between 2010 and 2020. In children with dilated cardiomyopathy, we analyzed baseline cardiac function, hemoglobin level, and subsequent risk of composite adverse events (CAE) including death, heart transplant, ventricular assist device (VAD) placement, and transplant registry listing. Absolute iron deficiency and iron sufficiency were defined as transferrin saturations < 20% and ≥ 30%, respectively; indeterminate iron status was defined as 20%-29%.

- **Results**: Of 799 patients with chronic heart failure, 471 (59%) had no iron-related laboratory measurements. Of 68 children with dilated cardiomyopathy, baseline transferrin saturation and quantitative left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), 33 (49%) and 14 (21%) were iron deficient and sufficient, respectively, while 21 (31%) had indeterminate status. LVEF was reduced to 23.6 ± 12.1% from 32.9 ± 16.8% in cases of iron deficiency and sufficiency, respectively (P = 0.04), without a significant difference in hemoglobin levels. After stratification by New York Heart Association classification, in advanced class IV, hemoglobin levels were reduced to 10.9 ± 1.3 g/dL compared to 12.7 ± 2.0 g/dL in iron deficiency and sufficiency, respectively (P = 0.01), without a significant difference in LVEF.

- **Conclusions**: In this single-center study, iron deficiency was not monitored in most children with chronic heart failure.

### Critical re-evaluation of the identification of iron deficiency states and effective iron repletion strategies in patients with chronic heart failure [^111Ws2Lt]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2024). High credibility.

According to guidelines, iron deficiency is defined by a serum ferritin level < 100 ng/mL or a transferrin saturation (TSAT) < 20% if the serum ferritin level is 100–299 μg/L. These criteria were developed to encourage the use of intravenous iron as an adjunct to erythropoiesis-stimulating agents in the treatment of renal anemia. However, in patients with heart failure, these criteria are not supported by any pathophysiological or clinical evidence that they identify an absolute or functional iron deficiency state. A low baseline TSAT — but not serum ferritin level — appears to be a reliable indicator of the effect of intravenous iron to reduce major heart failure events.

In randomized controlled trials, intravenous iron decreased the risk of cardiovascular death or total heart failure hospitalization in patients with a TSAT < 20% (risk ratio 0.67 [0.49–0.92]) but not in patients with a TSAT ≥ 20% (risk ratio 0.99 [0.74–1.30]), with the magnitude of the risk reduction being proportional to the severity of hypoferremia. Patients who were enrolled in clinical trials solely because they had a serum ferritin level < 100 μg/L showed no significant benefit on heart failure outcomes. It is noteworthy that serum ferritin levels of 20–300 μg/L lie entirely within the range of normal values for healthy adults.

Guidelines reflect the eligibility criteria of clinical trials, which inadvertently adopted unvalidated criteria to define iron deficiency. Reliance on these guidelines would lead to the treatment of many patients who are not iron deficient (serum ferritin level < 100 μg/L).

### Practical guidance for the management of iron deficiency in patients with inflammatory bowel disease [^117W6VWK]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2018). High credibility.

The goal of iron supplementation should always be complete normalization of hemoglobin (Hb) and iron storage. It should be kept in mind that even after normalization of Hb levels, iron stores may still not be replenished, as anemia is only the end point of iron deficiency. Iron treatments should be monitored clinically and through laboratory tests at least within 4 weeks for asymptomatic patients and more frequently for symptomatic patients. An important factor to monitor is the wellbeing of the patient. Clinically, quality of life (QoL) can improve within a few days after initiation of iron therapy and previous symptoms of anemia may decrease.

An adequate erythropoietic response has been defined as an increase of Hb of at least 2 g/dL or normalization within 4 weeks. As described, reticulocyte count and reticulocyte production index are faster indicators of successful treatment and will increase within 1–2 weeks following oral or intravenous iron, with or without erythropoietin (EPO).

Iron storage can be assessed using ferritin and transferrin saturation. During oral or intravenous iron supplementation, transferrin saturation can be falsely elevated. Ferritin levels may also overestimate the iron available for erythropoiesis in the bone marrow during intravenous iron treatment. Therefore, assessment of iron storage should only be performed a minimum of 4 weeks after the last intravenous iron application. After termination of iron therapy, the parameters of iron storage should be above the lower limits of normal. A recent study has pointed out that the time until reoccurrence of iron deficiency needs to be carefully monitored.

Regarding specific circumstances for iron deficiency anemia, particularly concerning patients undergoing surgery, assessment and timing are crucial. The ESAIC 2023 guidelines recommend considering a delay of 1–2 weeks after parenteral stimulation of erythropoiesis in cases of uncomplicated anemia. However, for oral correction of iron deficiency anemia and more complex cases, a period of 3–8 weeks is advised.

### AGA clinical practice update on management of iron deficiency anemia: Expert review [^115DLfwi]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

In this Clinical Practice Update (CPU), we provide Best Practice Advice (BPA) guidance on the appropriate management of iron deficiency anemia.

This expert review was commissioned and approved by the AGA Institute Clinical Practice Updates Committee (CPUC) and the AGA Governing Board to provide timely guidance on a topic of high clinical importance to the AGA membership. It underwent internal peer review by the CPUC and external peer review through the standard procedures of Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology. These Best Practice Advice (BPA) statements were drawn from a review of the published literature and from expert opinion. Since systematic reviews were not performed, these BPA statements do not carry formal ratings regarding the quality of evidence or strength of the presented considerations.

- **Best practice advice 1**: No single formulation of oral iron has any advantages over any other. Ferrous sulfate is preferred as the least expensive iron formulation.
- **Best practice advice 2**: Give oral iron once a day at most. Every-other-day iron dosing may be better tolerated for some patients with similar or equal rates of iron absorption as daily dosing.
- **Best practice advice 3**: Add vitamin C to oral iron supplementation to improve absorption.
- **Best practice advice 4**: Intravenous iron should be used if the patient does not tolerate oral iron, ferritin levels do not improve with a trial of oral iron, or the patient has a condition in which oral iron is not likely to be absorbed.

### Investigation and management of a raised serum ferritin [^116kXCsb]. British Journal of Haematology (2018). Low credibility.

Serum ferritin level is one of the most commonly requested investigations in both primary and secondary care. While low serum ferritin levels invariably indicate reduced iron stores, raised serum ferritin levels can result from multiple different aetiologies, including iron overload, inflammation, liver or renal disease, malignancy, and the recently described metabolic syndrome. A key test in the further investigation of an unexpected raised serum ferritin is the serum transferrin saturation. This guideline reviews the investigation and management of a raised serum ferritin level. However, the investigation and management of genetic haemochromatosis is not addressed here and is the subject of a separate guideline.

### Mircera [^115jdb58]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Evaluate the iron status in all patients before and during treatment. Administer supplemental iron therapy when serum ferritin is less than 100 mcg/L or when serum transferrin saturation is less than 20%. The majority of patients with CKD will require supplemental iron during the course of ESA therapy.

Correct or exclude other causes of anemia (e.g. vitamin deficiency, metabolic or chronic inflammatory conditions, bleeding, etc) before initiating Mircera [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)]. Following initiation of therapy and after each dose adjustment, monitor hemoglobin weekly until the hemoglobin level is stable and sufficient to minimize the need for RBC transfusion.

Individualize and use the lowest dose of Mircera sufficient to reduce the need for RBC transfusions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. In controlled trials, patients experienced greater risks for death, serious adverse cardiovascular reactions, and stroke when administered erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) to target a hemoglobin level greater than 11 g/dL for adult patients. No trial has identified a hemoglobin target level, ESA dose, or dosing strategy that does not increase these risks. Physicians and patients should weigh the possible benefits of decreasing transfusions against the increased risks of death and other serious cardiovascular adverse events [see Boxed Warning and Clinical Studies (14)].

### How I treat iron-refractory iron deficiency anaemia-an expert opinion-based treatment guidance for children and adults [^111f7YBB]. British Journal of Haematology (2025). Low credibility.

- **Case descriptions**: Existing literature predominantly addresses treatment outcomes in children with iron-refractory iron deficiency anaemia (IRIDA), while adults have distinct clinical needs and presentations. This is illustrated in cases from our iron expertise centre (Figure 2), which provides insights into the pathophysiology underlying treatment variability. The findings underscore the need for individualized approaches in both adults and children.

Figure 2. Course of haemoglobin, ferritin, and TSAT levels in three female IRIDA patients.

- **Case 1**: Hemoglobin and iron metrics over 6 years. This patient initially received intravenous (IV) iron therapy at irregular intervals due to being lost to follow-up. At age 26 (6 years post-diagnosis, time point t = 0), regular IV iron therapy was initiated. Over the subsequent years, she received a cumulative dose of 2500 mg of ferric carboxymaltose (FCM) via five 500 mg infusions, causing a sharp rise in ferritin (> 900 μg/L) and TSAT (up to 25%). Despite persistently high ferritin (> 700 μg/L), hemoglobin only briefly peaked and remained within the lower normal range.

- **Case 2**: Hemoglobin and iron metrics over 4 years, including two pregnancies (indicated by horizontal bars). At diagnosis (t = 0), this 32-year-old patient began monthly IV iron therapy. After a cumulative dose of 1700 mg FCM, the patient became pregnant (unaware at last administration). Particularly during the first pregnancy, TSAT remained stable and the hemoglobin decrease was less pronounced than during non-pregnancy periods.

- **Case 3**: Hemoglobin, C-reactive protein (CRP), and iron metrics over 20 years. IV iron (total…

### Disorders of iron metabolism. Part II: iron deficiency and iron overload [^116cS6G1]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2011). Low credibility.

Increased iron requirements, limited external supply, and increased blood loss may lead to iron deficiency (ID) and iron deficiency anaemia. In chronic inflammation, the excess of hepcidin decreases iron absorption and prevents iron recycling, resulting in hypoferraemia and iron restricted erythropoiesis despite normal iron stores, known as functional iron deficiency. This process may result in anaemia of chronic disease (ACD), which can evolve into ACD plus true ID (ACD+ID).

In contrast, low hepcidin expression may lead to hereditary haemochromatosis (HH type I, mutations of the HFE gene) and type II (mutations of the hemojuvelin and hepcidin genes). Mutations of transferrin receptor 2 lead to HH type III, whereas mutations of the ferroportin gene lead to HH type IV. All these syndromes are characterised by iron overload. As transferrin becomes saturated in iron overload states, non-transferrin bound iron appears. Part of this iron is highly reactive (labile plasma iron), inducing free radical formation. Free radicals are responsible for the parenchymal cell injury associated with iron overload syndromes.

- **Role of laboratory testing in diagnosis**: In iron deficiency status, laboratory tests may provide evidence of iron depletion in the body or reflect iron deficient red cell production. Increased transferrin saturation and/or ferritin levels are the main cues for further investigation of iron overload. The appropriate combination of different laboratory tests with an integrated algorithm will help to establish a correct diagnosis of iron overload and iron deficiency.

### Practical guidance for the management of iron deficiency in patients with inflammatory bowel disease [^114SBbZS]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

After correcting the Hb level, iron deficiency and anemia frequently and surprisingly quickly reoccur in patients with IBD, as risk factors might continue. A fast recurrence correlates with disease activity, even in clinically asymptomatic patients with low inflammatory parameters. A recent follow-up study after intravenous iron replacement therapy in 88 patients revealed a median of only 10 months for the recurrence of anemia and 19 months for the reoccurrence of iron deficiency in patients with IBD, suggesting that maintenance treatment may be needed.

The FERGImain study investigated intravenous maintenance therapy in patients with IBD who were previously successfully treated with intravenous iron carboxymaltose. Ferritin was controlled every 2 months, and if it dropped below 100 μg, 500 mg of intravenous iron carboxymaltose (n = 105) or placebo (n = 99) were given for 8 months. In the treatment arm of the study, anemia reoccurred in 27% of patients compared to 39% in the placebo arm. This was the first study to evaluate ferritin-guided maintenance therapy with intravenous iron.

In line with these studies, the guidelines recommend that every patient with IBD is monitored for recurrence of IDA every 3 months for at least 1 year following correction of iron and at least every 6–12 months thereafter. Laboratory parameters should include Hb, ferritin, transferrin saturation, and CRP. As soon as ferritin drops below 100 μg/liter or Hb falls below normal values, iron should be substituted using the same route.

Regarding the medical management of cancer-related anemia, particularly concerning iron replacement, the ESMO 2018 guidelines recommend administering iron therapy before the initiation of and/or during erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) treatment in patients with functional iron deficiency, which is characterized by transferrin saturation percentages and serum ferritin levels less than 100 ng/mL.

### Management of iron deficiency anemia in inflammatory bowel disease - a practical approach [^116c5dpZ]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Transferrin saturation (TfS) is a measure of the iron load of circulating transferrin. It does not, however, indicate the condition of the iron stores, providing only an indirect indication of the extent of iron utilization. Under physiological conditions, 16–45% of transferrin molecules in plasma are "loaded" with iron (3–4 mol of iron per mol of transferrin). A saturation of less than 16% is considered to represent a suboptimal iron supply for the erythropoietic process. While reduced transferrin saturation (< 20%) is highly sensitive (90%) for recognizing iron deficiency states, its specificity is poor (40–50%). Since measurements of both serum iron and serum transferrin are subject to significant circadian effects, blood samples should always be obtained at the same time of day and repeated frequently. Serum transferrin levels increase in patients taking oral contraceptive steroids but are reduced in the presence of inflammation (negative APP). This means that in patients with acute or chronic inflammatory disorders, TfS may be reduced despite normal iron stores.

### New concepts in the diagnosis and management approach to iron deficiency in candidates for metabolic surgery: Should we change our practice [^112bNqPw]. Surgery for Obesity and Related Diseases (2020). Low credibility.

The near-universal presence of chronic low-grade systemic inflammation among patients with severe obesity disrupts iron homeostasis and underlies the association between obesity and iron deficiency. Immune activation and inflammation result in a reduction in circulating iron and diminished iron bioavailability for erythropoiesis. Inflammation also alters blood levels of commonly measured markers of iron nutrition status, which makes the diagnosis of iron deficiency difficult and has led to new recommendations regarding laboratory markers for the diagnosis.

Recent evidence using these newly recommended laboratory markers, which include levels of ferritin, C-reactive protein, and transferrin saturation, suggests that the actual prevalence of iron deficiency among candidates for metabolic surgery may be double or triple the prevalence identified by low levels of ferritin alone. Thus, large numbers of surgical candidates have iron deficiency that has been heretofore largely unrecognized and inadequately treated. The assessment of iron status using the currently recommended markers in the presence of chronic inflammatory diseases and repletion of depleted stores for surgical candidates with deficiency during the preoperative period present an important opportunity for mitigating this condition in postoperative patients.

### Predictors of the response to treatment in anemic hemodialysis patients with high serum ferritin and low transferrin saturation [^113WdYn3]. Kidney International (2007). Low credibility.

Treating hemodialysis patients to combat anemia corrects hemoglobin but exacerbates iron deficiency by utilizing iron stores. Patients needing iron should receive this by intravenous (i.v.) means. The Dialysis Patients' Response to IV Iron with Elevated Ferritin (DRIVE) trial investigated the role of i.v. iron in anemic patients with high ferritin, low transferrin saturation, and adequate epoetin doses. We examined whether baseline iron and inflammation markers predict the response of hemoglobin to treatment.

Patients (134) were randomized to no added iron or to i.v. ferric gluconate for eight consecutive hemodialysis sessions spanning 6 weeks, with epoetin increased by 25% in both groups. The patients started with hemoglobin less than or equal to 11 g/dl, ferritin between 500 and 1200 ng/ml, and transferrin saturation of less than 25%. Significantly, patients with a reticulocyte hemoglobin content greater than or equal to 31.2 pg were over five times more likely to achieve a clinically significant increase in hemoglobin of greater than 2 g/dl. Lower reticulocyte hemoglobin contents did not preclude a response to i.v. iron.

Significantly higher transferrin saturation or lower C-reactive protein, but not ferritin or soluble transferrin receptor levels, predicted a greater response; however, their influence was not clinically significant in either group. We conclude that none of the studied markers is a good predictor of response to anemia treatment in this patient sub-population.

### Diagnosis and management of hemochromatosis: 2011 practice guideline by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^112BCrPS]. Hepatology (2011). Low credibility.

Phlebotomy remains the mainstay of treatment for hereditary hemochromatosis (HH). One unit of blood contains approximately 200–250 mg of iron, depending on the hemoglobin concentration, and should be removed once or twice per week as tolerated. In patients with HH who may have total body iron stores greater than 30 g, therapeutic phlebotomy may take up to 2–3 years to adequately reduce iron stores. Each phlebotomy should be preceded by measurement of the hematocrit or hemoglobin to avoid reducing the hematocrit/hemoglobin to less than 80% of the starting value.

Transferrin saturation (TS) usually remains elevated until iron stores are depleted, whereas ferritin, which may initially fluctuate, eventually begins to fall progressively with iron mobilization and reflects the depletion of iron stores. Serum ferritin analysis should be performed after every 10–12 phlebotomies (approximately 3 months) in the initial stages of treatment. Excess iron stores can be confidently assumed to be mobilized when the serum ferritin drops to between 50 and 100 μg/L. As the target range of 50–100 μg/L is approached, testing may be conducted more frequently to prevent the development of overt iron deficiency.

It is not necessary for patients to achieve iron deficiency, and this should be avoided. Phlebotomy can be stopped once iron stores are depleted, and the patient should be assessed for the need for maintenance phlebotomy. For reasons that are unclear, not all patients with HH reaccumulate iron and, accordingly, they may not need maintenance phlebotomy.

### Patients over 45 years with iron deficiency require investigation [^116Tis9m]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2003). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) that occurs in patients above the age of 45 years is often caused by gastrointestinal blood loss, and guidelines on the appropriate investigation of these patients have been published. There are few data regarding patients with iron deficiency who are not anemic, and it is not clear how these patients should be managed.

- **Objectives**: We set out to investigate the hypothesis that similar pathologies are likely to underlie iron deficiency and IDA, and to assess whether IDA was being investigated according to the guidelines published by the British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG).

- **Methods**: The pathology computer identified 153 consecutive patients over the age of 45 years who had serum ferritin levels below 20 microg/dl (normal range 20–200 microg/dl) in a two-month period (i.e. October and November 2000). Medical records were examined, and we recorded all investigations, the diagnoses reached, and the investigating specialty. The results were compared using odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

- **Results**: The study shows that the causes of iron deficiency and IDA are similar, but IDA is investigated more thoroughly than iron deficiency, OR 2.07, CI 1.08–3.97. Ten patients with iron deficiency without anemia were found to have celiac disease, a significant result, OR 6.71, CI 1.38–32.6. The majority of patients with IDA are not under the care of a gastroenterologist, and this group is significantly less likely to be investigated according to the BSG guidelines, OR 0.15, CI 0.04–0.6.

Conclusions show that the study…

### Ferrlecit [^11126u9P]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Ferrlecit is used to replete the body content of iron. Iron is critical for normal hemoglobin synthesis to maintain oxygen transport. Additionally, iron is necessary for metabolism and various enzymatic processes.

- **Mechanism of action**: Ferrlecit is role in replenishing iron is essential for healthy hemoglobin synthesis, supporting the body's oxygen transport capabilities and facilitating metabolic and enzymatic functions.

- **Pharmacokinetics**: Multiple sequential single-dose intravenous pharmacokinetic studies were performed on 14 healthy iron-deficient volunteers. Entry criteria included hemoglobin levels of ≥ 10.5 gm/dL and transferrin saturation (TSAT) of ≤ 15% or serum ferritin value ≤ 20 ng/mL. In the first stage, each subject was randomized 1:1 to receive undiluted Ferrlecit injection of either 125 mg/hr or 62.5 mg/0.5 hr (2.1 mg/min). Five days after the first stage, each subject was re-randomized 1:1 to receive undiluted Ferrlecit injection of either 125 mg/7 min or 62.5 mg/4 min (> 15.5 mg/min).

	- Peak drug levels (Cmax) varied significantly by dosage and rate of administration, with the highest Cmax observed in the regimen where 125 mg was administered in 7 minutes (19.0 mg/L). The terminal elimination half-life for drug-bound iron was approximately 1 hour. The half-life varied by dose but not by the rate of administration, with values of 0.85 and 1.45 hours for the 62.5 mg/4 min and 125 mg/7 min regimens, respectively. Total clearance of Ferrlecit ranged from 3.02 to 5.35 L/h. The AUC for Ferrlecit-bound iron varied by dose, from 17.5 mg-h/L (62.5 mg) to 35.6 mg-h/L (125 mg). Approximately 80% of drug-bound iron was delivered to transferrin as a mononuclear ionic iron species within 24 hours of administration in each dosage regimen.

### Guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of iron deficiency across indications: a systematic review [^116qgPPz]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2015). Low credibility.

Guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of iron deficiency (ID) vary widely across indications.

- **Objective**: We reviewed all available guidelines on the management of ID worldwide.

- **Design**: A literature search was conducted in PubMed, Cochrane, and EMBASE and on main professional association websites, limited to documents published between January 1, 2004, and June 30, 2014.

- **Results**: Of 127 guidelines identified, 29 were selected, involving 29 professional associations and issued from the United States (n = 8), Europe (n = 6), Britain (n = 4), Canada (n = 3), international organizations (n = 2), France (n = 2), Poland (n = 1), Australia (n = 1), Mexico (n = 1), and Japan (n = 1). Twenty-two guidelines provided recommendations on the diagnosis of ID, and 27 on its treatment. To define ID, all guidelines recommended a specific concentration for serum ferritin. Half of them (10 of 22) proposed transferrin saturation (TSAT) as an alternative or complementary diagnostic test. To treat ID, most of the guidelines (18 of 27) recommended the oral route if possible, particularly in children and in women in the pre- or post-pregnancy period. Iron supplementation should be administered intravenously according to 13 of 27 guidelines, particularly in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) (n = 7) and chemotherapy-induced anemia (n = 5). Treatment targets for ID included an increase in hemoglobin concentrations to 10–12 g/dL or normalization (n = 8) and serum ferritin > 100 μg/L (n = 7) or 200 μg/L (n = 4).

### Effect of oral iron repletion on exercise capacity in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and iron deficiency: The IRONOUT HF randomized clinical trial [^1161Q38A]. JAMA (2017). High credibility.

The IRONOUT-HF study, published in 2017 in JAMA, examined the effect of oral iron repletion on exercise capacity in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and iron deficiency. This multi-center, double-blinded, randomized clinical trial (RCT) involved 225 patients (80 female, 145 male) and aimed to address the trial question: What is the effect of oral iron repletion on exercise capacity in these patients?

- **Study design**: Multi-center, double-blinded, RCT.
- **Population**: 225 patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) < 40% and iron deficiency.
- **Inclusion criteria**: Patients with heart failure and reduced LVEF < 40% with iron deficiency.
- **Exclusion criteria**: Presence of neuromuscular, orthopedic, or other non-cardiac conditions preventing exercise testing, severe renal dysfunction, severe liver disease, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), known active infection, active gastrointestinal bleeding, active malignancy, and iron overload disorders.
- **Interventions**:
	- n = 111 received oral iron polysaccharide 150 mg twice daily (BID) for 16 weeks
	- n = 114 received a matched placebo BID for 16 weeks.
- **Primary outcome**: No significant difference in change in peak oxygen uptake at 16 weeks, with results showing 23 mL/min vs. -2 mL/min; difference 21, 95% CI -34 to 76.
- **Conclusion**: In patients with HF and reduced LVEF < 40% and iron deficiency, oral iron polysaccharide was not superior to placebo with respect to change in peak oxygen uptake at 16 weeks.

### Assessing iron status: Beyond serum ferritin and transferrin saturation [^116DvtSE]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2006). Low credibility.

The increasing prevalence of multiple comorbidities among anemic patients with chronic kidney disease has made the use of serum ferritin and transferrin saturation more challenging in diagnosing iron deficiency. Because serum ferritin is an acute-phase reactant and the inflammatory state may inhibit the mobilization of iron from reticuloendothelial stores, the scenario of patients with serum ferritin levels > 800 ng/ml, suggesting iron overload, and transferrin saturation levels < 20%, suggesting iron deficiency, has become more common.

This article revisits the basis for the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative recommendations regarding the use of serum ferritin and transferrin saturation in guiding iron therapy. It then explores some of the newer alternative markers for iron status that may be useful when serum ferritin and transferrin saturation are insufficient. These newer tests include reticulocyte hemoglobin content, percentage of hypochromic red cells, and soluble transferrin receptor, all of which have shown some promise in limited studies. Finally, the role of hepcidin, a hepatic polypeptide, in the pathophysiology of iron mobilization is reviewed briefly.

### British Society of Gastroenterology guidelines for the management of iron deficiency anaemia in adults [^116UwsGD]. Gut (2021). High credibility.

- **GI surgery**: Iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) is common following resection or bypass surgery involving the stomach and/or small bowel, including bariatric surgery (evidence quality — high, consensus — 92%, statement strength — strong). In new presentations of IDA, it is recommended that a history of gastrointestinal or bariatric surgery should not preclude a search for other causes of IDA (evidence quality — low, consensus — 85%, statement strength — strong).

Resection or bypass surgery involving the stomach and/or small bowel generally predisposes individuals to IDA. This includes the expanding population with a history of bariatric surgery, such as sleeve gastrectomy. Reduced nutritional intake and malabsorption are probably the major underlying mechanisms, and therefore IDA in this situation may occur in the context of other nutritional deficiencies, particularly of vitamin B12.

The prevalence of IDA depends on the specific diagnostic criteria employed, but it is found in approximately a quarter of subjects 2 years following Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and is markedly more common in women, as well as in those with preoperative evidence of low iron stores. The figure for sleeve gastrectomy is probably lower.

Predictably, the yield of other causative lesions on bidirectional endoscopy (BDE) is lower in individuals with IDA and a history of gastrointestinal surgery than in those without. Nevertheless, it is unsafe to automatically attribute IDA to previous surgery without excluding other possibilities, particularly in those at risk of underlying gastrointestinal malignancy. It is essential to bear in mind that partial gastrectomy may predispose individuals to the later development of cancer in the gastric remnant.

### Iron replacement therapy: do we need new guidelines [^114JkrER]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Approximately one-third of the world's population suffers from anemia, and at least half of these cases are due to iron deficiency. With the introduction of new intravenous iron preparations over the last decade, uncertainty has arisen regarding when these compounds should be administered and under which circumstances oral therapy remains an appropriate and effective treatment.

Numerous guidelines are available, but none provide detailed information on therapeutic start and end points or how iron-deficiency anemia should be optimally treated based on the underlying cause of iron deficiency, or in relation to concomitant or additional diseases.

This study highlights major issues to be considered in future revisions of guidelines for optimal iron replacement therapy. These include assessing the need for treatment, determining when to start and stop treatment, planning follow-up for relapse, recommending appropriate dosage and type of therapy, and identifying patients who may not require treatment.

### Guidelines for the management of iron deficiency anaemia [^117GJGKa]. Gut (2011). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) occurs in 2–5% of adult men and postmenopausal women in the developed world and is a common cause of referral to gastroenterologists. Gastrointestinal (GI) blood loss from colonic cancer or gastric cancer, and malabsorption in coeliac disease are the most important causes that need to be sought.

- **Defining iron deficiency anaemia**: The lower limit of the normal range for the laboratory performing the test should be used to define anaemia (B). Any level of anaemia should be investigated in the presence of iron deficiency (B). The lower the haemoglobin, the more likely there is to be serious underlying pathology and the more urgent the need for investigation (B). Red cell indices provide a sensitive indication of iron deficiency in the absence of chronic disease or haemoglobinopathy (A). Haemoglobin electrophoresis is recommended when microcytosis and hypochromia are present in patients of appropriate ethnic background to prevent unnecessary GI investigation (C). Serum ferritin is the most powerful test for iron deficiency (A).

- **Investigations**: Upper and lower GI investigations should be considered in all postmenopausal female and all male patients where IDA has been confirmed, unless there is a history of significant overt non-GI blood loss (A). All patients should be screened for coeliac disease (B). If oesophagogastroduodenoscopy (OGD) is performed as the initial GI investigation, only the presence of advanced gastric cancer or coeliac disease should deter lower GI investigation (B).

### Oral iron supplementation: New formulations, old questions [^115rYBb2]. Haematologica (2024). Low credibility.

Oral iron supplementation's optimal dosage and frequency involves differences in the elemental iron content among commercial formulations. Hence, dosage adjustments are necessary. Typically, oral supplementation starts with ferrous sulfate or other salts, each containing about 60–70 mg of elemental iron. Traditionally, it is recommended to take the supplement two or three times a day on an empty stomach, aiming for a daily dose of approximately 200 mg elemental iron. Considering that only 10–20 mg of iron is absorbed, such a dosage is needed to increase hemoglobin by 2 g/dL within 3–4 weeks. However, recent studies provide new insights, challenging the necessity for multiple daily doses. These insights stem from understanding that iron intake triggers homeostatic responses that prevent iron overload. These responses are orchestrated by hepcidin, which is induced to inhibit further iron absorption.

The role of hepcidin in oral iron supplementation was examined in a pilot study with non-anemic, iron-deficient young women. They were administered different doses of ferrous sulfate on varied schedules (twice a day, daily, or every other day). Ferrous sulfate, in three different iron isotopes, was used so each participant could serve as her own control. Results indicated that ingesting ferrous sulfate at doses of 60 mg elemental iron or higher induced hepcidin production for up to 24 hours, thereby reducing further iron absorption.

### Intravenous versus oral iron supplementation for correction of post-transplant anaemia in renal transplant patients [^115fVrZT]. BMC Nephrology (2009). Low credibility.

Post-transplant anaemia remains a common problem after kidney transplantation, with an incidence ranging from nearly 80% at day 0 to about 25% at 1 year. It has been associated with poor graft outcomes and increased mortality. Our transplant unit routinely administers oral iron supplements to renal transplant recipients, but this is frequently accompanied by side effects such as gastrointestinal intolerance. Intravenous iron is frequently administered to dialysis patients, and we sought to investigate this mode of administration in transplant recipients after observing less anaemia in several patients who had received intravenous iron just prior to being called in for transplantation.

- **Methods**: This study is a single-centre, prospective, open-label, randomised, controlled trial of oral versus intravenous iron supplements in renal transplant recipients. It aims to recruit approximately 100 patients over a 12-month period. Patients will be randomised to receive a single dose of 500 mg iron polymaltose (intravenous iron group) or 2 ferrous sulphate slow-release tablets daily (oral iron group). The primary outcome is the time to normalisation of haemoglobin post-transplant. Prospective power calculations have indicated that a minimum of 48 patients in each group would need to be followed up for 3 months to have a 90% probability of detecting a halving of the time to correction of haemoglobin levels to ≥ 110 g/l in iron-treated patients, assuming an alpha of 0.05. All eligible adult patients undergoing renal transplantation are considered for inclusion in this study.

### British society of gastroenterology guidelines for the management of iron deficiency anaemia in adults [^115bHVQo]. Gut (2021). High credibility.

Executive summary of recommendations and practice statements:

- **Background**: Iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) is common, and a major cause of morbidity worldwide (evidence quality — high, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong). IDA can be caused by a range of GI pathologies including cancer, and so GI investigation on an urgent basis should be considered in adults with a new diagnosis of IDA without obvious explanation (evidence quality — high, consensus — 85%, statement strength — strong).

- **Definitions**: We recommend that anaemia is defined as a haemoglobin (Hb) concentration below the lower limit of normal for the relevant population and laboratory performing the test (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong). We recommend that iron deficiency should be confirmed by iron studies prior to investigation. Serum ferritin is the single most useful marker of IDA, but other blood tests (e.g. transferrin saturation) can be helpful if a false-normal ferritin is suspected (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 92%, statement strength — strong). We recommend that a good response to iron therapy (Hb rise ≥ 10 g/L within a 2-week timeframe) in anaemic patients is highly suggestive of absolute iron deficiency, even if the results of iron studies are equivocal (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).

### British Society of Gastroenterology guidelines for the management of iron deficiency anaemia in adults [^1115rbrv]. Gut (2021). High credibility.

The absorption of oral iron salts is significantly impaired if taken with food, potentially reducing bioavailability by up to 75%. This necessitates taking iron in the fasting state, either first thing in the morning or during periods between meals. It is unclear how soon after taking oral iron food can be consumed, but the inhibitory effect of tea on iron absorption dissipates within 60 minutes. Despite previous suggestions of benefit, coadministration of vitamin C with oral iron replacement therapy (IRT) is not recommended. A recent large randomized controlled trial confirmed it neither enhances the hematological response or rate of iron loading, nor diminishes side effects.

Iron absorption from oral preparations is determined by a complex interplay involving total body iron stores, erythropoietic activity of the bone marrow, recent exposure of the small intestine to iron, and systemic inflammation. Hepcidin is the most important inhibitor of iron absorption. Hepcidin levels follow a diurnal pattern and increase after oral iron intake, impairing fractional absorption of subsequent doses.

Short-term studies of iron-depleted but otherwise healthy women have shown that oral doses of 60 mg elemental iron stimulate increased hepcidin levels for the next 24 hours, reducing subsequent iron absorption by 35%–45%. Consequently, the overall absorption of iron from 60 mg of elemental iron taken once a day was similar to that from 60 mg taken twice a day. Therapy with low-dose oral iron has been reported to be successful and safe in elderly patients with iron deficiency anemia (IDA), with a daily dose of 15 mg.

### Prospective evaluation of a clinical guideline for the diagnosis and management of iron deficiency anemia [^115YNPhS]. The American Journal of Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

We examined the effect of introducing an evidence-based clinical guideline on the diagnosis and evaluation of iron deficiency anemia.

- **Subjects and methods**: The guideline recommended measurement of serum ferritin levels for all anemic patients with a mean corpuscular volume (MCV) ≤ 95 fL and endoscopic evaluation for those with a serum ferritin level less than 45 ng/mL. Physicians practicing in the general medicine inpatient and outpatient services of two university-affiliated hospitals were informed about the guideline and the data supporting it. Clinical evaluations during the 9 months before ("control period", n = 3341 patients) and the 9 months after ("intervention period", n = 3173 patients) the introduction of the guideline were compared.

- **Results**: There was a 30% increase (95% confidence interval [CI]: 22% to 39%) in the proportion of anemic patients who underwent serum ferritin evaluation in the intervention period (41% [n = 1284]) compared with the control period (31% [n = 1040]), and a 24% increase (95% CI: 4% to 48%) in the proportion with a serum ferritin level < 45 ng/mL (8.1% [n = 256] vs. 6.5% [n = 217]). The proportion of anemic patients who underwent endoscopic evaluation within 4 months of measurement of low serum ferritin level in the intervention period (3.3% [n = 106]) was 67% higher (95% CI: 23% to 125%) than in the control period (2.0% [n = 67]), and the proportion with serious gastrointestinal lesions found as a result of endoscopy was 62% (95% CI: 8% to 145%) higher (1.8% [n = 57] vs. 1.1% [n = 37]).

The introduction of a guideline for the diagnosis and management of iron deficiency anemia showed significant improvements in the evaluation and management of anemic patients.

### British Society of Gastroenterology guidelines for the management of iron deficiency anaemia in adults [^114wkrGu]. Gut (2021). Low credibility.

Blood transfusion is rarely required to treat IDA, firstly, because most patients with slowly developing anaemia adapt to the resulting physiological stress. Secondly, as parenteral iron reliably produces a clinically meaningful Hb response within a week, it should always be considered as an alternative. Transfusion should, therefore, be reserved for those with severe symptomatic and/or circulatory compromise. If used, packed red cells should be transfused in accordance with established good practice guidelines, and a target Hb of 70–90 g/L (80–100 g/L in those with unstable coronary artery disease) would be reasonable. Since a unit of packed red cells contains about 200 mg of elemental iron, it will not replenish the iron store deficit in severe IDA, and so restrictive transfusion should be followed by adequate iron replacement.

There should be a prompt and measurable haematological response to the initiation of IRT, and early monitoring should detect those patients not responding to or intolerant of oral iron. Failure to respond to oral iron has many causes including non-compliance, malabsorption, systemic disease, bone marrow pathology, haemolysis, continued bleeding, and deficiency of vitamin B12 or folic acid.

The absence of an Hb rise of at least 10 g/L after 2 weeks of daily oral IRT is strongly predictive of subsequent failure to achieve a sustained haematological response (sensitivity 90.1%, specificity 79.3% for adequate subsequent response). In this situation, parenteral iron is more effective than continuing traditional oral therapy.

Logistically it may be difficult to…

### British Society of Gastroenterology guidelines for the management of iron deficiency anaemia in adults [^111gPYEe]. Gut (2021). Low credibility.

Functional iron deficiency describes a condition where, despite normal iron stores in cells of the monocyte-macrophage system, the supply of iron for erythropoiesis is inadequate. Absolute iron deficiency occurs when body iron stores are insufficient to meet demands. This restrictive effect is modulated by hepcidin, which also limits iron absorption through the gut mucosa.

A common clinical setting for functional iron deficiency (FID) is chronic kidney disease (CKD), where parenteral iron therapy enhances the response to administered erythropoietin to correct anaemia. FID is also a component of the anaemia of chronic disease, prevalent in conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Detailed insights into the complex pathogenesis of anaemia of chronic disease are beyond the scope of these guidelines.

An area of difficulty is determining whether patients presumed to have FID — with raised inflammatory markers and serum ferritin (SF) in the normal range — actually have reduced iron stores indicative of absolute deficiency. When attributing anaemia to FID, it is crucial to assess evidence of a chronic illness. Studies in CKD suggest that, in the absence of thalassaemia, the percentage of hypochromic red cells and Retic-Hb are better predictors of response to intravenous iron therapy, compared to transferrin saturation. A transferrin saturation of less than 20% indicates iron restriction, especially in thalassaemia carriers.

Similar evidence shows low Retic-Hb as an independent marker of iron restriction in non-CKD settings, providing a reliable indicator.

### Iron supplementation to treat anemia in patients with chronic kidney disease [^111uowxP]. Nature Reviews Nephrology (2010). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency is prevalent in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), and the use of oral and intravenous iron in patients with CKD who do not require dialysis might obviate or delay the need for treatment with erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs). Patients on hemodialysis have lower intestinal iron absorption, greater iron losses, and require greater iron turnover to maintain the ESA-driven red cell mass than healthy individuals.

In these patients, intravenous iron reduces ESA dose requirements and increases the likelihood of maintaining hemoglobin levels within the desired range. Oral iron is inferior to intravenous iron in patients on hemodialysis, in part because elevated serum levels of hepcidin prevent the intestinal absorption of iron. Increased levels of hepcidin also impair the normal recycling of iron through the reticuloendothelial system.

Levels of serum ferritin and transferrin saturation below 450 pmol/l and 20%, respectively, are indicative of iron deficiency, but values above the normal range lack diagnostic value in patients with CKD on dialysis. The availability of various iron preparations and new developments in delivering iron should enable adequate provision of iron to patients with CKD. This review examines the efficacy, safety, and use of iron supplementation therapy for the treatment of anemia in patients with CKD.

### Attendance at iron deficiency anaemia clinic: Audit of outcomes 5 years on [^114pnnz2]. Colorectal Disease (2013). Low credibility.

To determine the long-term outcomes of patients in whom no initial cause for their anaemia is established, six hundred and thirty-nine patients presenting to an iron deficiency anaemia pathway were prospectively entered onto a database. The initial assessment included haematological review, coeliac screen, oesophagogastroduodenoscopy, and colonic imaging as per British Society of Gastroenterology guidelines. A 5-year audit of outcomes was undertaken using patient medical records and hospital laboratory databases.

A diagnosis was found initially in 266 (42%) patients, with 124 (19%) having a gastrointestinal (GI) luminal neoplasm, 54 (8%) of which were malignant. Twelve patients had a nonluminal or non-GI malignancy. Eighty-eight (14%) had benign upper GI bleeding and 23 (4%) had coeliac disease. One hundred and forty-three (22%) did not have confirmed iron deficiency anaemia upon reviewing haematinics. Complete records were available for 595 (93%) patients at 5 years. Of the 373 patients in whom a cause was not initially diagnosed, 6 (2%) were ultimately diagnosed with a GI luminal malignancy and 18 (5%) with a nonluminal or non-GI malignancy. There was no difference in the incidence of malignancies between those with or without confirmed iron deficiency.

Most patients in whom no cause was found at initial investigation resolve on oral iron supplements. Patients with normal ferritin values had as high an incidence of GI malignancies as those with low values and should be investigated.

### Gastrointestinal causes of refractory iron deficiency anemia in patients without gastrointestinal symptoms [^116P5kHG]. The American Journal of Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

The standard evaluation of a patient with iron deficiency anemia includes a complete evaluation of the gastrointestinal tract to identify a source of bleeding. However, even following a careful examination, many patients remain without a diagnosis. Because iron deficiency anemia results from iron loss or defective absorption, we sought to determine the prevalence of potential gastrointestinal sources for iron deficiency anemia in patients without gastrointestinal symptoms.

- **Methods**: Over a 10-month period, 668 outpatients were referred to the University Hematology Department with iron deficiency anemia, defined by a hemoglobin concentration less than 14 g/dL (less than 12 g/dL in women), mean corpuscular volume less than 80 fL, and ferritin level less than 30 microg/L. After excluding patients with obvious causes of blood loss, inadequate diet, chronic diseases, or malignancies, there were 81 eligible patients, 10 of whom refused investigation. The remaining 71 patients (51 women, median age 59 years) underwent colonoscopy, as well as gastroscopy with gastric (antrum and body) and duodenal biopsies.

- **Results**: A likely cause of iron deficiency anemia was detected in 60 patients (85%). Diseases associated with bleeding were found in 26 patients (37%), including colon cancer (10 patients), gastric cancer (2), peptic ulcer (7), hiatal hernia with linear erosions (5), colonic vascular ectasia (3), colonic polyps (2), and Crohn's disease (1). Causes not associated with bleeding were found in 36 patients (51%), including 19 with atrophic gastritis and 4 with celiac disease.

### Monitoring recovery from iron deficiency using total hemoglobin mass [^113S6cwS]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2015). Low credibility.

Using hemoglobin concentration ([Hb]) to diagnose borderline iron deficiency and monitor the progress of its treatment is difficult because of the confounding effects of plasma volume. Because hemoglobin mass (Hbmass) is not affected by plasma volume, it may be a more sensitive parameter. The aim of this study was to monitor Hbmass, iron storage, and maximal oxygen consumption (V˙O2max) during and after oral iron therapy in subjects with severe and moderate iron deficiency.

- **Methods**: Three groups of female recreational athletes were monitored for at least 22 weeks, as follows: 1) severe iron deficiency group (SID) (n = 8; ferritin, ≤ 12 ng·mL), 2) moderate iron deficiency group (MID) (n = 14; ferritin, ≤ 25 ng·mL), and 3) control group (n = 8; ferritin, > 25 ng·mL). Hbmass and iron status were determined before, during, and up to 12 weeks after at least 10 weeks of oral iron supplementation. In total, five V˙O2max tests were performed before, during, and after the supplementation period.

- **Results**: Hbmass increased markedly in the SID group (15.6% ± 11.0%, P < 0.001) and slightly in the MID group (2.2% ± 3.7%, P < 0.05) by the end of the supplementation period and remained at this level for the following 12 weeks. [Hb] and Hbmass were similarly affected, but Hbmass was more closely related to mean corpuscular volume and mean corpuscular hemoglobin than [Hb]. The SID group incorporated 534 ± 127 mg of iron into ferritin and hemoglobin, whereas the MID group incorporated 282 ± 68 mg of iron. V˙O2max increased only in the SID group by 0.20 ± 0.18 L·min (P < 0.05) and was closely related to the changes in Hbmass.

### Aranesp [^117TVcio]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Important dosing information**: Evaluate the iron status in all patients before and during treatment. Administer supplemental iron therapy when serum ferritin is less than 100 mcg/L or when serum transferrin saturation is less than 20%. The majority of patients with CKD will require supplemental iron during the course of ESA therapy.

- **Monitoring of response to therapy**: Correct or exclude other causes of anemia (e.g. vitamin deficiency, metabolic or chronic inflammatory conditions, bleeding, etc) before initiating Aranesp. Following initiation of therapy and after each dose adjustment, monitor hemoglobin weekly until the hemoglobin level is stable and sufficient to minimize the need for RBC transfusion.

### Diagnosis and management of transfusion iron overload: The role of imaging [^115SwEfS]. American Journal of Hematology (2007). Low credibility.

The characterization of iron stores is crucial to prevent and treat iron overload. Serum markers such as ferritin, serum iron, iron binding capacity, transferrin saturation, and nontransferrin-bound iron can be used to monitor trends in iron status; however, variability in these markers limits their predictive power for any given individual. Liver iron represents the most reliable single marker of total iron balance. Measures of liver iron include biopsy, superconducting quantum interference device, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MRI is the most accurate and widely available noninvasive tool to assess liver iron. The main advantages of MRI include a low rate of variability between measurements and the ability to assess iron loading in endocrine tissues, the heart, and the liver. This manuscript describes the principles, validation, and clinical utility of MRI for tissue iron estimation.

### British Society of Gastroenterology guidelines for the management of iron deficiency anaemia in adults [^1149wkcb]. Gut (2021). Low credibility.

- **Definitions**: We recommend that anaemia is defined as a haemoglobin (Hb) concentration below the lower limit of normal for the relevant population and laboratory performing the test (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong). We recommend that iron deficiency should be confirmed by iron studies prior to investigation. Serum ferritin is the single most useful marker of IDA, but other blood tests (e.g. transferrin saturation) can be helpful if a false-normal ferritin is suspected (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 92%, statement strength — strong). We recommend that a good response to iron therapy (Hb rise ≥ 10 g/L within a 2-week timeframe) in anaemic patients is highly suggestive of absolute iron deficiency, even if the results of iron studies are equivocal (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).

- **Anaemia**: The WHO defines anaemia as a haemoglobin (Hb) concentration below 130 g/L in men over 15 years of age, below 120 g/L in non-pregnant women over 15 years of age, and below 110 g/L in pregnant women in the second and third trimester. The diagnostic criteria for anaemia in IDA vary between published studies. The normal range for Hb also varies between different populations in the UK. It is reasonable to use the lower limit of the normal range for the laboratory performing the test to define anaemia, but these should be aligned with the WHO defined lower limits. There is little consensus as to the level of anaemia that requires investigation. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) referral guidelines provide further insight into this issue.

### Exjade [^116EBBue]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

During therapy, monitor serum ferritin monthly to assess the patient's response to therapy and minimize the risk of overchelation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]. Interrupt treatment when serum ferritin is less than 300 mcg/L and obtain an LIC to determine whether the LIC has fallen to less than 3 mg Fe/g dw. Use the minimum effective dose to achieve a trend of decreasing ferritin. Monitor LIC every 6 months.

After 6 months of therapy, if the LIC remains greater than 7 mg Fe/g dw, increase the dose of deferasirox to a maximum of 20 mg/kg/day. Do not exceed a maximum of 20 mg/kg/day. If after 6 months of therapy, the LIC is 3–7 mg Fe/g dw, continue treatment with deferasirox at no more than 10 mg/kg/day. When the LIC is less than 3 mg Fe/g dw, interrupt treatment with deferasirox and continue to monitor the LIC.

Monitor blood counts, liver function, renal function, and ferritin monthly [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2, 5.4)]. Increase monitoring frequency for pediatric patients who have acute illness, which can cause volume depletion, such as vomiting, diarrhea, or prolonged decreased oral intake. Consider dose interruption until oral intake and volume status are normal [see Dosage and Administration (2.4, 2.5), Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Use in Specific Populations (8.4), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Restart treatment when the LIC rises again to more than 5 mg Fe/g dw.

- **Administration**: Do not chew tablets or swallow them whole. Take Exjade once daily on an empty stomach at least 30 minutes before food, preferably at the same time each day.

Iron deficiency anemia can be caused by a variety of conditions. These include hemorrhoids, peptic ulcer disease, celiac disease, colonic diverticulosis, intestinal hookworm infection, chemical- and radiation-induced hemorrhagic cystitis, ulcerative colitis, sideroblastic anemia, Helicobacter pylori infection, and chronic gastritis. Other causes may be small bowel adenocarcinoma, pregnancy, lead poisoning, intraoperative blood loss, Heyde's syndrome, ankylostomiasis, phlebotomy, gastric cancer, colon cancer, menorrhagia, and gastrointestinal bleeding. Additionally, conditions such as Crohn's disease and menstruation contribute to this anemia, as well as medications like oxymetholone.

### Intravenous iron therapy for non-anaemic, iron-deficient adults [^115Y5XQc]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). High credibility.

Iron deficiency is one of the most common nutritional deficiencies and has several physiological manifestations. Early, or non-anaemic, iron deficiency can result in fatigue and diminished exercise capacity. Oral iron preparations have a high incidence of intolerable side effects and are ineffective in certain forms of iron deficiency. Consequently, intravenous iron preparations are increasingly used in the treatment of non-anaemic iron deficiency. The newer, more stable iron preparations, in particular, claim to have a lower incidence of side effects and are now used across a range of different patient populations.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of intravenous iron therapy in the treatment of adults with non-anaemic iron deficiency.

- **Search methods**: On 18 October 2019, we electronically searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, two further databases, and two trials registries. We hand-searched the references of full-text extracted studies and contacted relevant study authors for additional data.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials that compared any intravenous iron preparation to a placebo in adults. We excluded other forms of comparison, such as oral iron versus placebo, intramuscular iron versus placebo, or intravenous iron studies where other iron preparations were used as the comparator. We also excluded studies involving erythropoietin therapy or obstetric populations.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors screened references for eligibility, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We resolved differences in opinion.

### Exjade [^114SQc4g]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Monitoring recommendations for pediatric patients with transfusional iron overload and NTDT: It is recommended that serum ferritin be monitored every month to assess the patient's response to therapy and minimize the risk of overchelation.

- **Renal function monitoring**: Monitor renal function by estimating GFR using an eGFR prediction equation appropriate for pediatric patients and evaluate renal tubular function. Monitor renal function more frequently in pediatric patients in the presence of risk factors for renal toxicity, including episodes of dehydration, fever, and acute illness that may result in volume depletion or decreased renal perfusion. Use the minimum effective dose.

- **Interruption and resumption of Exjade therapy**: Interrupt Exjade in pediatric patients with transfusional iron overload and consider dose interruption in pediatric patients with non-transfusion-dependent iron overload for acute illnesses that can cause volume depletion, such as vomiting, diarrhea, or prolonged decreased oral intake. Monitor more frequently and resume therapy as appropriate, based on assessments of renal function, when oral intake and volume status are normal. Evaluate the risk-benefit profile of continued Exjade use in the setting of decreased renal function and avoid the use of other nephrotoxic drugs.

- **Juvenile animal toxicity data**: Renal toxicity was observed in adult mice, rats, and marmoset monkeys administered deferasirox at therapeutic doses. In a neonatal and juvenile toxicity study in rats, deferasirox was administered…

### Optimizing diagnosis and treatment of iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia in women and girls of reproductive age: Clinical opinion [^116dVjra]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2023). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency (ID) is the world's most common disorder and one of the top five causes of years lived with disability. Whereas low serum ferritin is diagnostic of ID, ferritin — an acute phase reactant — may be elevated in inflammatory states and the first trimester of pregnancy even if ID exists. Consequently, in early pregnancy or chronic inflammation, percent transferrin saturation (TSAT) measurement is the best indicator of iron status.

Unfortunately, guidelines do not recommend routine screening for ID in either pregnant or nonpregnant women in the absence of anemia; this circumstance should be urgently reviewed based on available data. While oral formulations have long been the standard for iron replacement therapy and are widely available and inexpensive, oral iron is frequently associated with adverse gastrointestinal effects for the majority — a major reason for poor adherence, inadequate repletion, and persisting ID symptoms and sequelae.

Although safe intravenous iron administration was introduced in the mid-1950s, formulations with cores binding the elemental iron more tightly became available in the 2000s, allowing complete and safe replacement, even in a single setting. Prospectively acquired neonatology evidence reports oral iron's failure to reach the developing fetus when the mother is iron deficient. Consequently, while oral iron remains frontline in the first trimester because of insufficient safety data for intravenous iron, the author recommends that the intravenous route should be the gold standard for second-trimester ID when hemoglobin concentration is…

### VAFSEO [^115WRUmV]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Pre-treatment and on-treatment evaluations of anemia, iron stores, and liver tests**: Correct and exclude other causes of anemia (e.g. vitamin deficiency, metabolic or chronic inflammatory conditions, bleeding) before initiation of VAFSEO. Evaluate iron status in all patients before and during treatment. Administer supplemental iron therapy when serum ferritin is less than 100 mcg/L or when serum transferrin saturation is less than 20%. The majority of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) will require supplemental iron during the course of therapy. Measure hemoglobin (Hb) at baseline and as recommended in section 2.4.

- **Liver testing**: Measure serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and bilirubin prior to the initiation of VAFSEO and monthly after initiation for the first 6 months. Then, monitor as clinically indicated [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Discontinue VAFSEO if there are persistent ALT or AST elevations greater than 3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) or if ALT or AST elevations greater than 3 times ULN are accompanied by a bilirubin increase greater than 2 times ULN [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

- **Important dosing information**: Individualize dosing and use the lowest dose of VAFSEO sufficient to reduce the need for red blood cell transfusions. Do not target a hemoglobin level higher than 11 g/dL. VAFSEO can be taken with or without food; it should be swallowed whole. Tablets should not be cut, crushed, or chewed. VAFSEO can be administered without regard to the timing or type of diet.

### Iron-deficiency anemia [^111sFJG3]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2015). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on iron deficiency anemia:

- **Definition**: IDA is a form of anemia that results from inadequate iron supply for erythropoiesis and is defined as a hemoglobin level two standard deviations below normal, with evidence of low body iron stores.

- **Pathophysiology**: IDA can be caused by increased iron demand (e.g. pregnancy, infancy), insufficient iron intake, decreased iron absorption (e.g. IBD, gastrectomy), chronic blood loss (e.g. menorrhagia, systemic bleeding, hookworm infection), use of certain drugs (e.g. NSAIDs, corticosteroids), genetic factors (e.g. iron-refractory IDA), and iron-restricted erythropoiesis (e.g. CKD).

- **Epidemiology**: In the United States, the prevalence of iron deficiency ranges from 4.5% to 18%, while the prevalence of IDA is estimated at 2.9%.

- **Disease course**: IDA typically presents with hypochromic, microcytic erythrocytes. Clinical manifestations are related to the severity of the anemia and may additionally include restless leg syndrome, decreased quality of life, and increased maternal and newborn mortality.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Iron deficiency is an independent predictor of cardiovascular events in patients with coronary artery disease. It is also a risk factor for all-cause mortality in patients with CKD. IDA is associated with both morbidity and mortality in pregnant women.
